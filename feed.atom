        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last time I checked, my pawn Bronco sat at 80 in the monthly leaderboard of the pawn global rankings. Not forgetting that this is pre-release, so his place within the top 100 isn't quite as good as it seems. This pains me. I am saddened that my sweet, sweet boy Bronco isn't being picked up by adventurers as much as I'd like. He may not be a 1:1 recreation of a popular anime character or like, Tony Blair, but he is fantastic at shredding monsters.
Thing is, his ranking means that I'm not doing enough. Right now, I need to make his CV more appealing to prospective clientele and I need to become the agent he deserves. Dragon's Dogma 2 may be an action RPG, but it is also about being the best agent you can possibly be.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[According to a site construction notice.
Back in 2021, Nintendo announced that it was building a museum-style facility, then called the “Nintendo Gallery”, on the site of its Uji Ogura Plant in Kyoto, with expectations that construction would be finished in March 2024. The building work on the site — since given the official title Nintendo Museum — looked to be on course from the outside, but it seems the museum will miss its target completion date by a month or so.
The construction notice displayed at the site, as captured below by @hanayohaneNEKO on Twitter (thanks, Kyotogamer), now lists the completion date as 30th April. It's unclear how long this notice update has been up, but it does appear that the museum won't quite be ready for the end of March.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Whether you’re trying to work your way through Mr Raccoon’s long list of requests, or you simply just fancy yourself some Dried Fruit to help you keep going long enough to see sundown, you’re going to need a Dehydrator. Here’s how to get one in Stardew Valley. 


The good news is that you don’t need to get to a particular point in the game as the recipe is available from the very beginning, though you will need to save up a bit if you’ve just started a new save file in honor of the 1.6 update. If you're getting a Dehydrator purely to please Mr Raccoon, you'll also need a Smoker.


How to get a Dehydrator in Stardew Valley

There are two routes you can go down if you want to get a Dehydrator - you can buy the recipe, or you can effectively steal one once you reach a certain early landmark point of the game. 


The huge benefit of buying the recipe (aside from being free of the guilt that comes with obtaining one through theft) is that you can make as many Dehydrators as you like. It can be a bit of a pain to only have one of anything, so if you’re wanting a lot of Dried Fruit, this is the way to go. 


To purchase the Dehydrator recipe, you can visit Pierre’s store at any point in the game and cough up 10,000 Gold. It’s right at the bottom of his list of wares, underneath the Saplings and to make a Dehydrator, you’ll need the following resources:



30 Wood


2 Clay


1 Fire Quartz



However, once you’ve earned 25,000 Gold and Demetrius comes to visit you asking to use your cave so that he can observe the local species, you do have a chance to get your hands on a single Dehydrator for free. Don’t judge me, I found this out by accident with a misclick.


If you opt for a Mushroom Cave, you’ll get a Dehydrator inside. Of course you can use it within the cave without any issue, but if you use your Pickaxe on it, the Dehydrator will go into your inventory and then you’re free to place it wherever you like.

Snufkin: Melody of Moominvalley follows the titular character as he returns to Moominvalley after wandering over the winter. The valley, a peaceful haven for nature and the Moomins’ sustainable lifestyle has changed, though. Nature has been organized and contained, and Snufkin’s best friend, Moomintroll, is nowhere to be found.

How to find your Pawn ID in Dragon's Dogma 2

Here's a step-by-step guide to finding your Pawn ID in Dragon's Dogma 2.



Open your in-game Pause menu.


Select Status


Scroll through to your Pawn using C/Z on PC, RT/LT on Xbox, or L2/R2 on PlayStation.


Select Pawn using Q/E on PC, LB/RB on Xbox, or L1/R1 on PlayStation.


Look for the Pawn ID section in Arisen Details.



Once you reach this menu, you'll find your Pawn ID, username or Gamertag, and other information about your Pawn. You'll also spot your Pawn Quest, badges, vocation, and other helpful information to help you gauge your Pawn's progression. You'll be able to find the ID and username of your Pawn and other players, but not those officially created by Capcom.


How to use your Pawn ID in Dragon's Dogma 2

To use someone's Pawn ID to invite their character to your party, head to any nearby Riftstone and select Search for a Pawn. From here, you'll find the following options:



Advanced Pawn Search


View Favorite Pawns


Friends' Pawns


View Previously Hired Pawns


Pawns Your Main Pawn Knows


Search by Pawn ID



By selecting Search by Pawn ID, you can type someone's Pawn ID and invite their character, allowing you to use them during your playthrough. Likewise, you can check your friends' Pawn list and summon those your friends have made, allowing you to skip the Pawn ID process entirely.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dragon's Dogma 2 departs from the norm of standard games when it comes to save files. You'll see that clearly from the main menu screen, which is missing a key feature that any player would be familiar with. We're talking about starting a new game in Dragon's Dogma 2, a simple yet complicated aspect of this new Capcom entry. 


How do you start a new game in Dragon's Dogma 2?


You must manually delete your saves to start a new game in Dragon's Dogma 2. I know it's a bit unusual, but it was done this way to make your choices more impactful. For example, once the character creation is done, race cannot be adjusted afterward. This also includes the decisions made throughout the game, from siding with one character during a quest to winding up in jail. 


To delete your Steam cloud saves for Dragon's Dogma 2, you'll need to locate the correct files. The console version isn't as tricky, as it only requires going to the settings and manually getting rid of them there. For a full breakdown, check out our guide on deleting saves. 


Although changes are limited in the game, a few exceptions exist, primarily with character creation and Vocations. Those who aren't entirely satisfied with their avatar may salvage their design through the barber. Of course, it won't showcase all the features of the initial character creator, but it still beats starting a new save for it. Vocations are completely changeable at any time, too, via the Vocation Guild. 


If you want to start a new game in Dragon's Dogma 2 because of a "wrong" decision, you may have some luck with the 'Load from Last Inn Rest.' It will return the party to the last inn, potentially wiping out this mistaken choice. I recommend sleeping here before embarking on some big mission. Sometimes, it's easy to tell when a decision-making event is about to happen, especially when two characters are at odds. So, before progressing further in these quests, rest at an inn, just in case.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Grasshopper Manufacture announced during its summer showcase last year that its 2011 supernatural action game Shadows of the Damned is getting an encore in the form of a remaster. We now know the title of that update, along with a release window.
The newly christened Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered is coming later this year. Unfortunately, the game’s website and Steam page don’t detail exactly how the game has been enhanced from a performance standpoint. Grasshopper did release screenshots, so you’ll have to use those to discern the difference between this re-release and the original. A demo of the game is currently playable at Grasshopper’s booth at PAX East. 

Shadows of the Damned was first released for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 on June 21, 2011, and served as a collaboration between Resident Evil mastermind Shinji Mikami (who served as producer) and Grasshopper founder Goichi “Suda51” Suda (the game's writer). It stars Garcia Hotspur, a demon hunter who battles his way through the depths of the underworld to rescue his captive girlfriend, Paula. The game’s fun, over-the-shoulder shooter action combined with its irreverent, absurd humor earned it a 9.25 out of 10 in our original review and a cult following over the last 13 years. EA originally published Shadows of the Damned, and it was never ported to other platforms. Grasshopper is self-publishing the remaster. 
Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.]]></summary>

        <updated>2024-03-22T14:55:45.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are many reasons why hiding your helmet could benefit you in Dragon's Dogma 2, from seeing your character's face to masking that your newest headpiece doesn't quite suit you. Let's talk about whether you can hide your helmet in Dragon's Dogma 2.


Can you hide your helmet in Dragon's Dogma 2?


No, you can't hide your helmet in Dragon's Dogma 2. Once you equip a headpiece to your character or Pawn, its appearance will stay until you find and wear a new helmet. Similarly, you can't hide or change the appearance of equipment pieces like body and leg armor unless you equip different ones. 


With this in mind, there are two options you can explore: using third-party mods at your own risk or not using a helmet at all. While modding has risks, such as downloading questionable files or corrupting your save, it's often a safe option that many players use to introduce quality-of-life fixes or new custom features.

However, if you prefer a safer route, you can remove your helmet, sacrificing stats in the name of fashion. While this would significantly reduce your defensive stats and combat resistances, it's safe to do in towns with little combat and frequent cutscenes. To get rid of your helmet, head into your inventory, select your helmet, and pick "Remove". You'll un-equip your headpiece, allowing you to see your character or Pawn's face and hair.


Alternatively, if you want high defensive stats and prefer keeping your helmet on, you can purchase more from armor merchants in major cities. Although this means you have to spend money to get better-looking equipment, it's worth it to transform a peculiar-looking hat into one worthy of charging into battle.

Take this Ugreen Docking Station, a longtime member of our best Steam Deck accessories guide: Prime members can have one for 30% in the UK and 40% in the US. Gated as they are, these savings make Ugreen’s dock less than half the price of Valve’s official Steam Deck Docking Station, despite it providing a similarly healthy supply of ports and jacks.

Arrowhead Studios' rebalancing of key small arms and support weapons in Helldivers 2 makes perfect sense, then, as the Helldivers' arsenal changes with patches. As it currently stands, things are looking up!


More specifically, Helldivers 2's first major rebalancing update arguably knee-capped the game's strongest and most user-friendly weapon: the Railgun, and players were quickly forced to adapt by relying on a variety of other support weapons and Stratagems. Now, weeks after the nerf, we're looking at a surprisingly healthy and varied meta, with weapons such as the one-off anti-tank launchers, the luger-esque autocannon, and the Railgun itself each enjoying a niche al…]]></summary>

This Bobber not only looks cool, but comes with a huge perk. Here’s how to get one and how it works. 


The Sonar Bobber is a type of Tackle that can be placed onto an Iridium or Advanced Iridium Rod (gained through the Fishing Mastery). It allows you to see exactly what you’re catching before you reel it in, giving you the chance to let the fish drop if it’s not one you want, saving you time and energy.

If you can believe it (and, to be honest, we can't) it has been a whopping 15 years since Pokémon Platinum first arrived on Western shores. It has been a decade and a half since we first met Giratina and co. A decade and a half since we stepped foot in the Distortion World. And, most importantly perhaps, a decade and a half since we last got an 'ultimate' third entry to a Pokémon generation.
We'll dowse ourselves in Repel Spray before taking a step further — yes, you could count Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon as a 'definitive' edition for Gen VII. In fact, we might even do the same. This is a pair of games that carried much of the same DNA as the ones that came before them (Sun and Moon, in this case) while adding new Pokémon, locations, and a fresh storyline. Sounds pretty 'ultimate' to us.

In my performance analysis, I touched on DD2 being particularly unplayable on the Steam Deck, suffering from sub-10fps framerates and a bunch of broken settings. Since that was based on pre-release code, I had quietly hoped that Capcom could pull something – anything – out of the bag to salvage handheld PC play in time for launch day, but now the time has come, I’ve checked again, and nope. This RPG adventure simply doesn’t work on the Steam Deck, and probably never will.

The problem is so prevalent, in fact, that Dragon's Dogma 2 - which enjoyed stellar critique and came highly recommended according to OpenCritic - came out to a 'Mostly Negative' review rating on Steam. It's not difficult to see why, either, with over twenty different microtransaction options to choose from. Some of these are garden-variety DLC goodies, such as assorted camping gear and minuscule equipable items, but other examples include a token that lets you change your character's appear…]]></summary>

Announced at the Future Games Show, Tails of Iron 2: Whiskers of Winter has been confirmed for Nintendo Switch, bringing brutal combat and bloody visuals later this year.
Doug Cockle, best known for his work on The Witcher franchise as Geralt of Rivia, returns to narrate the new trailer in spectacular fashion, but the true star here is the wonderful art direction. It carries over the same handdrawn animation seen in the first game, but now with even greater detail and wonderful use of colour.

Actually, I'm surprised anyone is reading this instead of leisurely skipping through Ferngill Republic. If you are here (first of all, thanks), then you're probably wondering about the mod situation. When the new patch was sent out, there may have been some concerns that any mods you had installed for the game would be immediately rendered non-compatible. I did a story recently about how Nexus Mods was asking content creators to make sure they were prepared for the big 1.6 push, adding that a "considerable chunk of mods will be broken" post-update.

You basically have two saves: the last time you slept at an Inn, and the most recent time you left the game. If you choose to manually save it will make a manual save, but it acts more like an autosave than an actual save point that you can reload. The intent is for choices and decisions and their weight to matter, and Capcom clearly tried to prevent save scumming. Still, there may be situations when you want to manually delete saves. Here's how to delete saves in Dragon's Dogma 2.

If you follow the main questline, shortly after the prologue, you’ll be taken to the capital city of Vernworth. Not long after that, you’ll be left to wander the streets.

How to setup Camp in Dragon's Dogma 2


There are essentially two requirements to setup a Camp in Dragon's Dogma 2. First off, you need to be at a Campsite. These are typically indicated by a burning campfire out in the world. When you approach and interact with the campfire, you'll be given the option to setup a camp.


Next, you'll need some camping equipment like a Camping Kit in order to setup the Camp.


Also, you'll want to make sure you clear the area around the campsite from monsters and enemies. If you leave some around, they can attack you while camping which would disrupt the camping process and also destroy your camping equipment.


Why you should setup Camp


When you setup and rest at a camp, you get several benefits. First, you'll replenish your Health and Magick. When you interact with the Camp you'll also get several options:



Rest to Morning — Will advance the time to morning. (Day)


Rest to Evening — Will advance the time to evening. (Night)


Equip Skills — Equip and unequip Vocatiokn Skills for both your Arisen and Pawn.



Despite the options, you can also equip skills at a campfire without actually setting up a Camp. Therefore, if you're looking to just change up your skills, you do not need a Camping Kit to do so.


Ideally, you'll setup Camp to to heal up and advance the time to a certain point if you are far away from a town.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Warrior vocation in Dragon's Dogma 2 is one of two advanced vocations in the RPG. When you first reach the city of Vernworth, you can head to the Vocation Guild. The Vocation Guild trainer will tell you that it's possible to learn both the Warrior and Sorcerer vocations, but first, he has a task for you. Here's how to unlock the Warrior vocation in Dragon's Dogma 2.

Vocation Frustration quest guide


If you speak to the Vocation Guild trainer, he will tell you that while the Vocation Guild has the capability of teaching Warrior and Sorcerer vocations, a current weapon shortage is preventing them from doing so. However, if you can bring him a weapon for said vocation—that is, a Archistaff for Sorcerer or a Greatsword for Warrior. He gives you a tip that a gang of goblins to the west ambushed a trade shipment that should have had a Greatsword on it, which is exactly what you need.


If you look at your map, to the west of Vernsworth you should now have a quest location marked that indicates where you can find the Greatsword. Simply head west out of Vernsworth and follow the road until you reach the area indicated, which is near Trevor Mine. You will have to take out a group of Goblins but as long as you have some Pawns with you—and really, you always should—you will have no problem taking them out.


After taking out the Goblin's head for the chest they were guarding. Inside you will find a Greatsword, which is exactly what you needed. Head back to Vernsworth and speak to the Vocation Guild trainer to turn in the Vocation Frustration quest. You will have to handover the Greatsword, but doing so unlocks the Warrior vocation! If you choose to learn the Warrior vocation, you will actually be given the Greatsword back as a starter weapon to use with the vocation. Time to smash some skulls!

Fast Travel in Dragon's Dogma 2, explained


The two primary means of Fast Travel are Portcrystals and Oxcarts. You'll initially encounter an Oxcart during the early stages of the journey, which will be marked with its ox symbol on the map. Go on top of the cart and sit on a bench to trigger a response from the driver. They will tell you where they are heading and ask for the fare, typically a small fee of 100 G.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the early quests for Brant in Dragon's Dogma 2 tasks you with attending a masquerade in an effort to find the false Sovran. However, the masquerade is a fancy affair, and therefore you will need to dress in formal raiment as well as don a masquerade mask. Thankfully, Brant provides you with an Eventide Mask. But you will still need to know where to find formal raiment to wear for the masquerade in Dragon's Dogma 2.


Screenshot by Destructoid


Where to find the Courtly Tunic


You don't have to look far to find the proper formal raiment. You can find the Courtly Tunic in the city of Vernworth. In the center of the Noble Quarter is the Watchhead's Home, which is where the tunic is located. You can find the exact location on the above map. I waited until night so I could be all sneaky-like, but it doesn't actually matter. 


Once inside, proceed forward into the dining room and you will see a bag lying on the floor that you can interact with. This is the Courtly Tunic, which is the formal raiment required to attend the masquerade! Simply pick it up and you will now be able to equip it and the mask to attend the masquerade.


If you're like me, you're probably now trying to plot the perfect escape. After all, we essentially just stole someone's fancy clothes, right? However, it doesn't appear that this actually constitutes as theft in any way. You can simply walk right back out the way you came, right past the steward at the front, and back out into Vernworth.


Meet back up with Brant at the tavern to confirm you have the new duds, and that will proceed the quest to the next part in which you actually attend the masquerade. Make sure you equip the Courtly Tunic and Eventide Mask to properly attend the masquerade and hunt down proof of the false Sovran!

The scaley snake-like creatures return from Dragon's Dogma, and if you don't know exactly how to deal with them, they can overwhelm you very quickly. Here is how to kill Saurians in Dragon's Dogma 2 in the most effective manner.


Screenshot by Destructoid


Attack the Saurian Weakspot


You'll often encounter Saurian enemies near water, as the reptilian creature prefers to reside by it.


The weak spot on the Saurian enemy is its tail. If you try to just hit the Saurian head-on, you will deal reduced damage to it, sometimes completely negating the damage entirely.


Instead, if you focus on the tail, you will not only do bonus damage but eventually can sever the tail completely off of the Saurian. Doing so will reduce its previous resistances, allowing you to now attack the Saurian anywhere and deal the normal amount of damage to it.


Utilizing slashing/slicing weapons such as swords is very effective for severing the tail. However, you can also simply deal enough damage with magic and bludgeon damage to eventually knock the tail off.


Saurians often swarm in numbers and quickly become an overwhelming force in battle. You basically want to focus one at a time, aiming to sever its tail, before moving on to the next.


As for the best magical damage, you want to use Ice damage attacks when fighting a Saurian. They are weak to Ice all over their body, and can easily be completely frozen. Of course, this will also make it easier to remove the tail when the Saurian is frozen.


While there's no bonus effect for using Fire damage, it can also be effective as catching a Saurian on fire will cause it to roll around on the ground trying to put out the fire, making it an easy target.

It might be because you didn’t get the “true” ending. Maybe check here, and I’ll give you the facts.


Dragon’s Dogma 2 builds to an inevitable battle with the dragon that stole your heart. I mean literally, but maybe you did find yourself falling for those smoldering eyes, as well. I wouldn’t blame you.


During the battle (technically before), you’ll find yourself riding on the back of the dragon. If you simply remain here for a while, the game will transition to the final showdown against the heart-thief. If you defeat the dragon, the credits will roll, and you’ll be taken to the standard ending. You can either reload a saved game to try for a better ending or speak to the pathfinder at the palace to get sent back.


Note, however, that if you choose the option to “start from the beginning with your current level and equipment,” your save will be overwritten, and you won’t be able to simply go back and retry.


To actually get the true ending in Dragon’s Dogma 2, you need to get the Empowered Godsbane Blade. If you have this weapon, while riding on the dragon, you need to crawl around to its heart and use the weapon. Now, instead of the credits rolling, the adventure will continue, this time with you being set on the path to the true ending.

Here's how to kill an Ogre in Dragon's Dogma 2 and survive an encounter with one.





Tips for fighting an Ogre


The Ogre is an extremely powerful and agile creature, somewhat similar to a Cyclops. If you are a male Arisen, I would only bring a female Pawn if it is a Fighter or another tanky vocation as it will be the target of the Ogre for most of the fight. On the flip side, if your Arisen is female, I'd definitely recommend bringing some others or else you will be the target of the Ogre for most of the fight.

Well, this week marks the arrival of Princess Peach: Showtime! on the Nintendo Switch and it seems to have got off to a reasonably positive start receiving plenty of respectable scores so far.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Still Wakes the Deep, the atmospheric horror game from the makers of Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs and Everybody’s Gone to the Rapture, has a new trailer and a June release date. First revealed last June at the Xbox Games Showcase, it centers on an oil rig worker fighting to survive a supernatural threat. 
Developed by The Chinese Room, today’s Future Game Show provided a platform for a new trailer that serves as an effective tone-setter. Set in 1975, you play as an oil rig worker trapped on a deep sea rig off the coast of Scotland. Communications have been lost, and an unknown horror has overtaken the rig. The first-person adventure tasks you with locating your crew as a mysterious threat pursues you, and the raging ocean gradually tears the rig apart. With no weapons or special abilities, exploration is the name of the game.


Still Wakes the Deep is launching on June 18 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. It will also launch on Game Pass for console and PC. 
For more on The Chinese Room, the studio has also taken the reins of Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2, also slated to release this year. You can read more about what the studio has in store for that game here.]]></summary>

        <updated>2024-03-21T20:25:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Baldur’s Gate 3 was one of 2023’s most successful and critically acclaimed games, with many hailing it as one of the best role-playing games ever made. However, if you were hoping for the game to get an expansion or a sequel, that won’t be the case - at least not from its developer, Larian Studios. 
As reported by PC Gamer, Larian CEO Swen Vincke stated during an address at GDC today that the studio is finished with Baldur’s Gate 3. That means it won’t be getting any expansions nor will it be making a Baldur’s Gate 4. "We are a company of big ideas. We are not a company that's made to create DLCs or expansions," Vincke said. "We tried that actually, a few times. It failed every single time. It's not our thing. Life is too short. Our ambitions are very large.”
Not only that, but the studio is moving on from Dungeons & Dragons in general, with Vincke saying that "it's going to be up to Wizards of the Coast because it's their IP, to find somebody to take over the torch."


While Vincke says Larian is proud of what it accomplished, the studio wants to focus on a brand-new project. There's no telling what Larian may tackle next; given that it made Baldur's Gate 3 and the Divinity series, it's hard to imagine the studio not making another RPG of some sort. We'll have to wait and see. 
Baldur’s Gate 3 was released last August following a lengthy early access period to rave reviews, including several Game of the Year wins. While it’s disappointing that we won’t see any meaningful story updates for the title, we’re excited to see what Larian has in store next. 
As for other Dungeons & Dragons games that will pick up the torch, there's a few big titles on the horizon. Chief among them is Starbreeze's in-development D&D cooperative multiplayer game and Gameloft's D&D survival sim. 
You can read our review of Baldur's Gate 3 here. The game is also nominated for 10 BAFTA Awards next month, and you can read the full list of nominees here.

Set in the 15th century and taking place in the tumultuous land of Bohemia, Kingdom Come Deliverance follows the exploits of nice-but-dim blacksmith’s son Henry.

But first, he needs to learn how to use a sword…
One of the very first tasks in Warhorse Studios' epic RPG is to collect a debt from a lowly drunkard. After a short intro to dialogue choices, you proceed to confidently throw hands with the peasant. After being roundly beaten within an inch of your life, you limp off to mother to get fixed up. It’s an appropriate intro to this gritty journey of bloody revenge. There are many ways to approach a confrontation, it’s going to be a while before violence is the easy option.

In recent years there have been a few attempts to make a game like The Movies, with games like Moviehouse and Filmmaker Tycoon sitting pretty at 'mostly negative' status on Steam because they are not, in fact, like The Movies beyond the basic premise. But Blockbuster Inc. has shouldered its way into the conversation, wearing big puffy trousers, shouting through an old-timey megaphone, and openly billing itself as a "spiritual successor" to The Movies. It's launching on June 6th this year, but you can play the prologue on Steam for free right now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been one month since Balatro, the poker-inspired deckbuilding roguelite, was released, and it has taken the gaming world by storm. In that short timeframe it has earned rave reviews (including a 9.5 out of 10 from us), positioned itself as a Game of the Year contender, and sold 1 million copies. To the delight of many, a mobile version was recently announced to be in the works. 
For some players, Balatro seemingly came out of nowhere and its sole developer, LocalThunk, is just as mysterious. The highly private creator doesn't share his real name, but I was able to speak with him about his game development history, his philosophy for making games, how he came up with the idea for Balatro, and his reaction to its positive reception. Perhaps most importantly, LocalThunk also tells me the…]]></summary>

Step aside Mario, because Princess Peach is here to show everybody what she's capable of. Yes, after a reasonably short wait, Princess Peach: Showtime! is about to launch on Nintendo Switch, but the big question is whether it's actually any good.
The good news is that, yes, it does seem to maintain the usual Nintendo magic that you'd expect, and it received a more-than-respectable score of 8/10 from ourselves. We said that "there's creativity, style, and fun to spare here, with levels packed full of secrets, cool outfits, and enough new mechanics to ensure nothing ever outstays its welcome". Sounds decent!

Review code had even been sent out to press. But it was clear that the game needed more time in the oven, as developers Drop Bear Bytes acknowledged they needed "additional polish time and QA manpower" to test the "thousands of permutations" available in its deeply decision-driven storyline. Happily, that polish time has now come to an end, as the devs have today announced a fresh release date of April 10th.

Fae Farm, the charming life sim from developer Phoenix Labs, isn't quite done with updates just yet. The latest, aptly titled the 'Spring Update', brings a number of improvements and additions to the game that should prove most welcoming for fans.
The biggest change is honestly something that we wish was a thing in real life, and that's the 'double-day length' feature. In a nutshell, it essentially slows down time to allow you to perform more tasks within a single day. Given how much there is to do in the game now, this sounds like a dream come true.

So far we’ve seen the past, the present and the problems surrounding this new buzzword as it filters its way into our games and communities. In this final part of the series, I want to try and think concretely with you about what the future might hold; to go beyond what we think is just or legal, what we might be excited by or fearful of, and instead think about the practicalities of making and playing games today and how that might be impacted by generative AI's growing dominance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ark: The Animated Series has surprised launched today on Paramount +. Based on the hit Ark: Survival Evolved, the series was first announced at The Game Awards in 2020 and went from not having a release date or platform to suddenly having its first six episodes available now in the U.S. and Canada.
The series follows Helena Walker, a paleontologist who washes ashore a mysterious island brimming with dinosaurs and other extinct wildlife. After meeting another survivor and hunter named Bob, Helena learns how to fend for herself in this strange land while encountering myriad threats and survivors from throughout history. While the first six episodes of Season 1 are out now, the remaining seven episodes will arrive at a later date. 
The show’s star-studded cast includes Madeleine Madden, Michelle Yeoh, Vin Diesel, Gerard Butler, David Tennant, Russell Crowe, Jeffrey Wright, Karl Urban, Zahn McClarnon, Devery Jacobs, Elliot Page, Malcolm McDowell, Deborah Mailman, and Alan Tudyk. Check out the premiere trailer below. 


To mark the occasion, Ark: Survival Ascended is holding a special tie-in event in which players can unlock skins based on characters from the animated series, which replicate the show’s art style. Obtaining these involves collecting a series of notes titled “Dear Jane” written by Karl Urban’s character in the show, Bob. The first drop of skins will be for Helena, Bob, Dodo, and Scary the Parasaur. New notes will appear in the game each Tuesday and Thursday until April 11. Check out the trailer below.


Meanwhile, we're still awaiting an update on the long-quiet Ark 2 (also featuring Vin Diesel) which was announced in 2020 at The Game Awards. That game is currently scheduled to launch towards the end of the year. Hopefully this animated show is a decent holdover until the next big game arrives.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[No matter the industry – sports, television, movies, or games – the debate of "the greatest of all time" inevitably comes up. These debates are often full of superfluous apples-to-oranges comparisons and, as a result, are unlikely to come up with a definitive answer everyone will be happy with. But that's what makes them so fun. In that spirit, we're taking the month of March to hold our own bracket-style tournament, voted on by readers, to determine the greatest video game of all time.
Though we here at Game Informer assembled the bracket, even that was heavily influenced by our Reader Vote we held in 2018 to coincide with our 300th issue. Using the results of our 2018 Reader Vote combined with some input from staff, general sentiment in various online communities, and critical reception for more recent games, we assembled a starting bracket of 64 games. From here, we'll hold two rounds of voting per week until we whittle this field down to one ultimate winner.
Will this result in a definitive selection of the best game ever released? Or will it reveal a coordinated effort from a particular gaming community committed to seeing their favorite game rise through the ranks? Only time will tell. 
While this is meant to be a fun experiment to see how the results shake out within the Game Informer readership and community, we hope you'll come back to root for your favorites every Monday and Thursday until we are able to crown our champion in the 2024 Game Gauntlet. Be sure to bookmark this page or follow us on social media to be alerted when a new round starts!

I mean, who wouldn't be intrigued by its beautiful handmade models and sets? They all have such a lovely texture to them, and the slightly ramshackle way they fit together gives the game a firm sense of place. But after playing an early preview build of Harold Halibut this week, I've been disappointed by just how frustrating it is to actually play. It's not that it's difficult. In fact, the tasks Harold's assigned in the opening few hours of the game are almost insultingly easy, extending to little more than 'feed the fish' and 'talk to so and so', all of which can usually be accomplished by interacting with a single button prompt to move the story along.
Rather, it's Harold himself that makes everything feel like such a chore. He's a bit of a dolt, you see, and everyone around him knows it, treating him with such weary and open disdain like he's some kind of village idiot that I, too, quickly came to dislike him. Harold doesn't help himself much either on this front, weathering everyone's underlying frustration with him like it's all water off a duck's back. It doesn't seem to faze him in the slightest, perhaps because he's too oblivious to even notice. But while this doziness might wash in a book or TV show, taking control of such a character in a game isn't nearly as pleasant. After all, it's not just Harold that's being treated like an ignoramus. By extension, you, the player, are as well, which isn't just immersion-breaking and frustrating, but it's also insulting to your own intelligence. And that, my friends, does not equal happy adventure game fun times.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I usually know right away when I'm going to enjoy interactive fiction. But I don't always know why. Isle Of Maligree is a bit of an all-rounder, as pretty much every part of it is doing something right, but it's the sense that you're making your own version of its story that marks it out.
People are going missing on the island, and you've been sent to investigate. Only, it seems this isn't the first time, because some sinister magic is causing everyone to forget the whole thing ever happened. If you don't figure it out in time, you'll have to make a new character and try again. And if you're an amazing genius who figures it out on your first try... you'll want to try again anyway, to play it a different way and see what you missed. Maybe one day I'll even do it without getting stabbed.

First released in 2020, it's a gauntlet of fantasy turn-based battles where most attacks, abilities, buffs, debuffs, and items are very cleverly handled by mapping them onto the faces of dice. Oh, you're going to make your dice so much better! Now Slice & Dice has finally arrived on Steam in search of a wider audience, accompanied by an update adding oodles of new heroes, enemies, items, and more. For newcomers, hey, it has a demo.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been a while, but I'm finally back on the Nancy Drew mystery game train. Choo choo, next stop: San Francisco! This has pleasing synergy with my real life, because I'm currently watching through Monk, a popular detective show also set in San Francisco. Mr. Monk would be displeased by the house Nancy finds herself in this time, which is a mansion being converted into a B&B. The owner, Rose, is working on a shoestring budget and has decided that the best player to add to her renovation team is a young-adult woman who's a friend of a friend. It all makes sense! 
Nancy Drew: Message In A Haunted Mansion is the third game in the Nancy Drew mystery series of puzzle games, and boy does the weird first-person fixed camera work against you here. It's also a more disappointing plot than the previous games, but it adds in a new time system that, much like Stay Tuned For Danger, is an ambitious move - and in this case I think it sort of works. It's a mixed bag, is what I'm saying.

Developer Terarin Games is about to release a sequel to the excellent shmup Missile Dancer on the Switch eShop, but if you're intimately familiar with the first game, you might be in for a bit of a shock with Missile Dancer 2.
Launching on 28th March, 2024, the game ditches the top-down retro aesthetic of the original for a sprite scaler approach. It looks pretty great though, and we're all for developers that are willing to deviate from what made previous titles so successful.

Powerful. May 9th is the day, so you have time to practise your touchtyping with Mavis Beacon. I really enjoyed playing Cryptmaster's Steam Next Fest demo, so I'm excited for the full game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bend and slap.
It's kinda hard to believe, especially given how ridiculously popular the whole Mushroom Kingdom thing is, that we've had so few games starring its actual ruler as the protagonist over the years. Yes, there was Princess Toadstool's Castle Run on Nelsonic Game Watch back in 1990, Princess Peach's very first leading role (which you probably don't need to rush out and buy), and Super Princess Peach on DS, but nothing that feels like a proper turn as the core of a full-on adventure. Until now, that is.
Yep, whilst we were fully expecting this to be a throwaway sort of experience given the above track record, it turns out Princess Peach: Showtime! is easily Ms. Toadstool's finest hour (shocker), and a far more engaging romp than we had prepared for. It's still 100% a game aimed squarely at children, mind, and there's really not a whole ton of challenge for those seeking it, but for younger gamers, for relatives or friends sitting down to have a good old Nintendo sesh with some smaller kids, there's a whole lot of fun to be had with this one.

We’ve played as Peach in plenty of Mario-starring games through the years, but not since 2005’s Super Princess Peach has the artist formerly known as Princess Toadstool been the exclusive protagonist of her own journey. Princess Peach: Showtime is a wholly original adventure with an impressive amount of unique mechanics, but it fails to reach the platforming heights Nintendo has attained with its other characters in the past.


Showtime’s overall premise is one of the highlights as it creates an aesthetically interesting world that is able to look and play differently from level t…]]></summary>

It doesn't take a genius to appreciate that the Ultrahand ability featured in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is a remarkable feat of technology that completely transformed the way you interact with the land of Hyrule, even if you weren't completely enamoured with the experience itself.
It should come as no surprise, then, to learn that implementing such a vital new mechanic into the game was a rather tricky endeavour for Nintendo during its development (and some folks wonder why it took so long!).

In my review for 2016’s Hyper Light Drifter I wrote about how it was a game I created excuses for myself to keep playing after seeing credits writing, “I didn’t do it out of necessity; I did it because I wanted to stay in Hyper Light Drifter’s world for as long as possible.” I love the color, style, music, and overall vibe of that game, which is why I was so excited to finally go hands-on with its not-quite-a-sequel, Breaker, and finally have an excuse to exist in that world again.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This article's headline is the characterisation of Everdeep Aurora given to me by publisher Ysbryd Games, but bizarrely enough, it reminded me initially of Bloodborne. A 2D platformer from Nautilus Games, Everdeep Aurora begins on the surface, where a ruptured crimson moon fills the sky with blazing meteors. That menacing moon is the first hint of Bloodborne, obviously. The second is the lamp-lit, locked-up house to one side, whose unseen occupant tells you to get lost, adding that they don’t believe all this crazy talk about the apocalypse. 


I thought at once of the wealthier residents of Yharnam, feasting and laughing hysterically behind the shutters of their fancy townhouses on the night of the Hunt. There are no pitchfork-wielding mobs or werewolves stalking the vicinity, however. But there is a frog by a campfire, who tells you that everybody else has sought shelter underground, and hands you a drill so you can follow them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Skydance New Media’s mysterious World War 2 Marvel game has a title: Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra. It also has its first trailer and a release window.
First announced in 2022, the game stars Captain America and Black Panther Azzuri, who is the grandfather of T’Challa. The trailer shows them pursuing the mutual goal of taking down the Nazis/Hydra, though for their own personal reasons. Hailing from different worlds, neither is particularly fond of the other's methods, which draws them into conflict. The game also stars Gabriel Jones of the Howling Commandos and Wakanda spy leader Nanali. First revealed at GDC, check out its first cinematic trailer below. 


Marvel 1943 is a linear single-player experience where you’ll occupy the roles of all four characters at various points, providing different perspectives on the narrative and the war. The project is led by Skydance president Amy Hennig, best known as the principle writer of the Uncharted franchise. 
Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra is coming in 2025, though platforms are currently unknown. You can learn more about how Skydance is approaching the game’s storytelling by reading our 2022 interview feature with Amy Hennig and Skydance's story consultant, Marc Bernardin.]]></summary>

Today, I’d like to talk about some of the brighter futures that might come out of generative AI for us, as well as why the path toward them might be a tricky one to walk cleanly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dragon's Dogma 2 is an RPG of many admirable qualities. I’m especially attached to my Arisen’s current pair of Pawns, one of whom speaks with the wonderfully stretched intonations of a pitch-shifted Matt Berry. Sadly, none of its achievements pertain to technical fidelity. While decent-looking, Dragon’s Dogma 2 takes some serious hardware to maintain consistently smooth performance, with lowered quality settings lending only the most limp-wristed of helping hands.
DLSS and FSR 3 upscaling are more effective, but this is one game where powering through the worst of its stuttering and framerate drops will take more than a musclebound graphics card. Not for the first time with an RE Engine game, Dragon’s Dogma 2 appears severely CPU-limited, so it really does demand a fully-upgraded rig to ward off sluggishness – especially at higher resolutions.
Improving performance isn’t a completely hopeless endeavour, but besides the FPS wobbles, there are some settings oddities that need navigating as well. I’ll cover all that and more in this guide; even if we can’t fix Dragon’s Dogma 2 ourselves, at least we can better understand its strangeness.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You know when you remember a game really fondly and instead of ageing alongside you, it becomes more modern in memory? The Dragon's Dogma 2 experience is, essentially, how I remember its predecessor Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen. To me, DD2 feels like a remaster of the first, except it looks nicer, is more expansive, and features some rejigs to things like your AI pals.
Not that any of this is a bad thing! In fact, DD2's closeness to the original makes it just as much of a joy as the first, where your grand adventure isn't only grander, it's still at the whims of a world governed by chaotic physics and the passage of time. Quirks remain, for good and bad, but ultimately this is an RPG where you make travel plans and the game does it best to dash them. It never gets old.

Creating a sequel to a 12-year-old game is never an easy task. Recapturing the magic of the original while implementing modern technology and design strategies can mangle the core values that made the original special. Dragon’s Dogma 2 never loses sight of its roots, and constantly finds big and small ways to surprise me even 50 hours in. At its core, Dragon’s Dogma 2 captures a sense of adventure. While you’re the center point of the conflict and strife in the world, Dragon's Dogma 2 isn’t afraid to make you feel small. Around every bend, it…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dragon Ball Sparking Zero had a big coming out party in the form of a 13-minute gameplay presentation that gave fans a nice look at its moment-to-moment combat. Bandai Namco showed off what's new, what's staying the same, and even revealed more characters joining the roster. 
Naturally, Goku and Vegeta square off to show off Sparking Zero’s combat. The 3D fighter retains the familiar behind-the-back style of its predecessors, but graphically speaking, the flashy ki blasts and transformations look better than ever. 


The presentation introduces four new mechanics. First up is Skill Count, a number that rises as you execute moves during the battle and is then spent to trigger special abilities. Revenge Counter lets players retaliate with a big attack in the midst of absorbing damage. Super Perception is a parry-type move that lets players deflect an attack at the last moment (such as Goku smacking away Vegeta’s Galick Gun), but doing this spends Skill Count points. Lastly, Vanishing Assaults are teleport-based attacks designed to close the gap at mid-range to keep the pressure on your opponent.
Dragon Ball Sparking Zero looks to have a massive roster of fighters (many of them variations of Goku and Vegeta), and the following characters are joining the line-up:
Broly (Super Saiyan Full Power)
Burter
Dyspo
Hit
Jeice
Kakunsa
Kale (Super Saiyan Berserk)
Master Roshi (Max Power)
Nappa
Super Trunks
Toppo

Dragon Ball Sparking Zero still doesn’t have a release window, but it’s coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's deeply frustrating and disappointing when games get pulled from store shelves due to licenses expiring, and too few ever return. So it's great news that almost four years after Sega stopped selling Obsidian's fascinating spy thriller RPG Alpha Protocol on Steam due to music rights expiring, it has returned to sale on GOG. I'm always surprised that Alpha Protocol hasn't reached serious cult classic status because, as much as parts are distinctly wonky, the globetrotting sneak-o-shooter fizzes with ideas for intense dialogue, branching plot, and reputation systems with consequences. You do feel like a spy going up against the world, backed up only by shifty allies and a ridiculous pair of giant sunglasses.

Ubisoft have blundered into this, in classic Ubi style, by revealing that they've had an R&D team beavering away on a project called NEO NPC. It's the usual pitch. "Have you ever dreamed of having a real conversation with an NPC in a video game?", asks Ubi's official post about it. And what all people who make this fail to understand that the answer most normal people give if they think about it is "Erm, probably no, actually?"
Still, the internet made good hay from the prototype image Ubisoft shared on Xitter, as many people took the opportunity to make fun of the dialogue from Bloom, a prototype man in a prototype beanie who wants to be your friend.

This new industry obsession is still taking shape, and there are lots of questions still to be answered about how much it might cost in the future, who will have access to it, and what it will actually help with, not to mention fears about job losses and other harms. But there’s a bigger question bubbling underneath all of this that threatens to burst the wobbly generative AI bubble: is the entire boom built on stolen labour?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft's highly publicized acquisition of Blizzard has had wide-reaching effects, and while some of them have been quite awful, this month showcases one of the upsides. Diablo IV, one of Blizzard's big 2023 releases, comes to Xbox Game Pass late next week, on March 28. We enjoyed the game quite a bit at launch, calling it a "massive and deeply engrossing action RPG," so if you've been waiting to check it out, now is a good time to do so.
This month also includes a trio of games built around cars, though the three are each very different. F1 23 simulates the realism and intensity of Formula 1 racing, Hot Wheels Unleashed 2 is an arcade racer full of child-like wonder, and Open Roads (which will launch on Game Pass) is a quieter, narrative-driven game about a mother and her daughter going on a road trip. Maybe they'll help me on my journey of learning how to drive.
Here's the rest of the line-up:
What's Coming To Game Pass This Month
Lightyear Frontier (Game Preview) (Cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X|S) – Today
MLB The Show 24 (Cloud and Console) – Today
The Quarry (Cloud and Console) – March 20 | Our Review

Terra Invicta (Game Preview) (PC) – March 26
Diablo IV (Console and PC) – March 28 | Our Review

Open Roads (Cloud, Console, and PC) – March 28
Ark: Survival Ascended (Cloud, PC, Xbox Series X|S) – April 1
F1 23 (Cloud) EA Play – April 2

Plunderstorm will drop 60 pirates onto the Arathi Highlands to fight monsters, loot chests, level up, acquire abilities, and beat the hell out of each other as a storm closes in. It's initially due to run only for several weeks and will use wholly separate characters, though you can unlock cosmetics for your main wizards.

As the name implies, it's a bigger, bolder and more ambitious take on their still very popular sandbox game TerraTech, but according to Payload's founder and CEO Russ Clarke, they're viewing this new version as more of a successor to TerraTech than a full-bodied sequel. "The overall quality of experience is really a huge leap forward," Clarke told me during a press presentation last week. "We're not calling it a sequel because we felt that making it a sequel would be a bit too constraining." Rather, it's "more of a reimagining" of the original game, says Clarke, with a change in engine and fresh investment from Tencent allowing them to reach the full potential of their original vision.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, after months of rumors and speculation, LEGO (in partnership with Wizards of the Coast) revealed the first full look at the new Dungeons & Dragons-themed building set entitled Red Dragon’s Tale. The large 3,745-piece set is set to release on April 1 in LEGO stores and to those in the LEGO Insiders program. Everyone else can roll for initiative on snagging a set on April 4, for the price of $359.99.
Produced through the popular LEGO Ideas platform, where fans are able to submit their own build concepts that are then refined and produced as official sets, the final set includes a full dungeon and tower, a tavern, and six minifigures (including an Orc Rogue, Gnome Fighter, Elf Wizard, and Dwarf Cleric). Builders also get several iconic D&D monsters, including an owlbear, beholder, displacer beast, and, of course, the red dragon Cinderhowl, who acts as the centerpiece of the set.

Interestingly, LEGO is offering an actual D&D adventure book to LEGO Insiders as a free digital download or as a paperback book that can be purchased with 2,7000 Insider points. That same book will show up on D&D Beyond (Wizards of the Coast’s digital hub for D&D) complete with characters sheets and digital dice. Presumably, the idea is that you could play out the adventure with the included LEGO minifigs and monsters as the miniatures used on the table, which is a pretty slick way for dedicated players to capitalize on the completed build.
In addition to the larger set, LEGO also revealed plans for a full line of D&D-themed minifigures, launching in September 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I didn't have any particular expectations for Heart Machine's open world roguelike Hyper Light Breaker, but I wasn't expecting it to feel so... broken-up, I guess. In this sequel to 2016's alternately wistful and frenzied action-RPG, you are a debonair-looking sod with a hoverboard, paraglider, blades and guns, sent out into the procedurally generated realms of the Overgrowth to kill Abyss Kings, eat stat boosts and extract with loot.
The aforesaid hoverboard and glider, together with the streaking neon visual direction, suggest a game of fluid acrobatics, akin to the studio's last release Solar Ash, which, to quote Ed's review, "has you rollerblade around shattered worlds like a post apocalyptic gazelle on wheels". Perhaps that game exists deeper within Hyper Light Breaker, but during my 20 minutes with the game at GDC, I found myself stopping and starting and struggling to build momentum using a combat system that felt both deliberately challenging and stilted.

Developed by Cyan Worlds, a team led by the masterminds of the original game, Riven is being remade from the ground up in Unreal Engine 5. First announced in 2022, the game is promised to be a faithful homage that leverages modern tech to allow for immersive visuals, free movement, expanded storytelling, and new puzzles. Check out its latest teaser trailer below. 


Riven: The Sequel to Myst was first released in 1997 and has been hailed as a PC classic of the era. It's so beloved that an existing fan-driven remake, The Starry Expanse Project, was already in the works when Cyan Worlds announced this remake. Recognizing their efforts, Cyan Worlds worked with The Starry Expanse to incorporate their efforts into this official remake. 
Outside of PC, it's unclear which platforms, VR or otherwise, Riven will target. To keep up with similar projects, check out our Big List of Upcoming Video Game Remakes.]]></summary>

Eight years after its official launch, Stardew Valley remains one of the most popular games on the market right now, which is no surprise; whether you're marrying a neighbor, farming crops, or toiling away in the mines, it's a game with something for everyone. Its creator, solo developer ConcernedApe, has updated it with plenty of free patches over the years, adding multiplayer, new farm types, and more, but when he moved on to work on his next game, Haunted Chocolatier, the Stardew updates came to an end.

        <updated>2024-03-19T14:29:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Balatro, the hit poker-inspired roguelike deckbuilder, has hit 1 million sales within its first month of release. Publisher Playstack also revealed a mobile version is in development.
Created by solo developer LocalThunk, Balatro is a roguelike tasking players to play poker hands to fulfill score criteria and advance a series of rounds. Along the way, they’ll spend money to augment their deck with new cards with special effects while collecting powerful Jokers that bestow a wide range of passive and trigger abilities.  
The game has earned widespread acclaim and popularity since launching on February 20. I awarded it a 9.5 out of 10, writing in my review, “Balatro is an ingenious and entertaining roguelike and one of my favorite games of the year. Playing it has become a near-obsession; everything feels perfectly designed to encourage you to keep trying because that next run could be the run of your life. Even after hours of play, I still can’t overcome Balatro’s biggest challenge: putting it down.”


In a press release announcing the 1 million milestone, LocalThunk writes, 
“I'm so grateful to all the players and people that have made this happen. I still can't grasp the response to this game, and I am overjoyed that so many people have been able to have fun with my silly creation. I'm so fortunate that I can continue working on my passion as a career. Thank you!”
Balatro is currently available for PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC. There’s no release window for the impending mobile versions.]]></summary>

Riven: The Sequel To Myst was the 1997 sequel to Myst, the 1993 pre-rendered adventure game which sold a million CD-ROM drives and launched a thousand specks of spittle from John Walker's mouth. The remake previously had a longwinded name of its own, Riven: New Discoveries Of The Lost D'ni Empire, but now is simply named Riven. They should rebrand again and call it Riven: The Sequel To The Myst Remake.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Detective Edward Carnby looks very different these days, and not only because he’s made of a lot more polygons. Gone are the professorial waistcoat and bow tie of his angular 1992 incarnation, replaced instead by the grubby suit of a life-bruised 1930s noir PI, complete with hipflask of brandy for when the stress of being unaccompanied with the lights out gets too much.
Carnby isn’t the only one who’s transformed in this reboot of Alone in the Dark, the classic survival horror avant la lettre, either. Veterans will find plenty of callbacks and familiar names as they poke around its Louisiana manor house – talk of the Pregzt Shipping Company might raise an eyebrow, for instance, as may the gnarled tree filling much of the conservatory. But like these, everything here is remixed, rewritten, relocated. Indeed, Decerto house is no longer empty but a ‘home for the mentally fatigued’, while player characters Carnby and Emily Hartwood now arrive together, since she’s hired him to help check on her uncle, a long-term resident who may be in danger.

Clearly, it was also a question on the minds on Japanese indie developers ThinkGames Inc, who have just announced their debut game Valiant Tactics EX. The 38-second long reveal trailer paints quite an enticing picture ahead of its Steam launch on March 29th, and that's not even the half of it either. For Valiant Tactics EX isn't just an anime Total War-like. It's also a whopping great deckbuilding game.

The program launches today in the Steam Beta Client and it replaces the Steam Family Sharing and Steam Family View features. 
Steam Families can have up to six members, and joining gives you access to any sharable games in each member's library. “Sharable games” is an important distinction, as Family Sharing is a feature that any developer can choose to opt out of for any reason at any time. Some games are also ineligible for sharing due to technical reasons. 
Noteworthy games currently eligible for Family Sharing include Helldivers 2, Baldur's Gate 3, Balatro, Cyberpunk 2077, Elden Ring, and Hogwarts Legacy. You can read the full list here.

An entire generation of fighting game fans have been born, hit puberty, graduated college, found a career, and possibly started a family in the time between the last Fatal Fury game and the upcoming City of the Wolves. The most recent entry, Garou: Mark of the Wolves, was released in 1999 for arcades (and 2001 for Dreamcast in the West), meaning the series has been dormant for over 25 years. Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves sees the series make its long-awaited return, and it already feels ready to stand alongside the big boys of the genre.
I had a chance to play over an hour of City of the Wolves at the SNK World Championship Finals last weekend, where I also spoke with director Hayato Konya . Fatal Fury has been an arcade mai…]]></summary>

It helps that I'm hunting Bigfoot. Hefting my magical bow, I peer around a tree trunk at the creature as he wanders down a slope of vivid orange grass sprinkled with pale blue rock. I only have a couple of arrows in my quiver, which doesn't feel like nearly enough, so I edge across the hillside to another tree trunk, where I can hopefully line up a headshot.

Why are people angry that this character has seven fingers? Why does Nvidia want me to talk to a robot about ramen? Why is everyone saying AI is smart when it still can’t manage its Classical Era luxury resource economy in Civilization properly? In this new series, we’re going to explore what 'generative AI' is, why it’s arrived now in the games industry, and what it might mean for people who make, write about and play games in the future.

Being able to play a game away from my PC can be handy.

        <updated>2024-03-18T13:22:14.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Animal Well, the gorgeous indie metroidvania that will also be the first game published by Videogamedunkey's Bigmode, will hit PlayStation 5, Switch, and PC this May. More specifically, developer Shared Memory, which is just solo dev Billy Basso, revealed in a new gameplay trailer the game will launch on May 9. 
Dunkey revealed Big Mode, his own publishing arm, back in 2022, later announcing that Shared Memory's Animal Well would be the first game it publishes. Now, just shy of two years later, Animal Well will finally be in the hands of players in just a couple of months. 
Check out the Animal Well release date trailer for yourself below: 


"After nearly 7 years of development, Animal Well is finally almost ready to be released out into the world," Basso writes on X (formerly Twitter). "I have made this trailer to commemorate the occasion. I hope you like it. I don't really know what else to say." 
As you can see in the trailer above, Animal Well continues to look hauntingly gorgeous, and even kind of cute if you're a fan of spooky animals. We also get new glimpses of the game's metroidvania exploration, too, by way of a special yo-yo with a light that lures animals forward and more. Plus, there's a dog, which rules. 
Animal Well hits PlayStation, Switch, and PC on May 9.

In it, you'll explore a vast labyrinth of tunnels, solve puzzles and escape its many mammalian-based horrors, all of whom  are out to gobble you up in one fell swoop - though as a strange, tiny little blob creature the size of a chicken nugget, it's unclear both what you are, and why exactly you're so appetising to them. Well, it probably has something to do with looking like a sentient chicken nugget, I suppose. Come and watch the release date trailer below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[SNK has released a new gameplay trailer for its upcoming fighter, Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves, revealing it's due out in "early 2025" as well. This trailer arrives roughly half a year after SNK formally revealed Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves in a trailer similar to today's, featuring Terry Bogard facing off against Rock Howard. 
That duo returns for another fight in the latest trailer, spotlighting the game's new "REV" system that features Rev Guard, Rev Blow, Rev Accel, and presumably more we'll learn about when the game is released next year. 
Check it out for yourself in the new Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves gameplay trailer below: 


Unfortunately, the trailer doesn't reveal anything else about the game, including platforms. Presumably, it will come to PlayStation and Xbox (possibly Switch), and PC. 
SNK will release Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves in early 2025.
In the meantime, check out SNK's original tease for the game from 2022, and then watch the Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves reveal trailer from last year.

Instead, it now sits at the heart of a controversy that began with misinformation and is now being fueled by mischaracterization and misinterpretation. Today we'll shine new light on the case and show why it has implications for every internet user in the country. That leads to the role of ISPs and whether internet users can rely on them to defend whatever privacy they have left.

Variety has more details about these crewmembers, including quick descriptions of each: 
Red – Captain of The Skeld
People-pleaser, blowhard

Fun fact: failed upwards
Purple  – Chief of Security
Safety, suspicion, sarcasm
Task: wet blanket
Fun fact: trust issues
Orange – HR
Spineless corporate shill

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Combat is such a routine activity in video games that it often doesn't feel much like conflict at all. It's just something done to move the simulation along - a propulsive chore stripped of drama or significance or lasting emotion beyond a vague desire to see what lies beyond whatever it is you're trying to kill. In Death Of A Wish, combat has substance: it's a form of redemptive self-expression. The game's fights are a means of asserting and cherishing yourself in the face of a world that regards you as a deviant, a world whose poison you carry on the inside.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dragon's Dogma 2 is right around the corner, launching on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC next week on March 22. Ahead of the game's launch, Capcom has released a new gameplay overview trailer with more than seven minutes of new footage; and perhaps strangely, it's narrated by actor Ian McShane (Deadwood, John Wick, Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides). 
Broken up into three sections in the video, McShane discusses "The Hero" of Dragon's Dogma 2, the "Two Nations," and, of course, "The Monsters" that players will be killing plenty of during their journey. 
Check it out for yourself in the Dragon's Dogma 2 gameplay overview trailer below: 


Dragon's Dogma 2 hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on March 22, 2024. 
For more about the game, read Game Informer's hands-on Dragon's Dogma 2 preview, and then check out this story about how Dragon's Dogma 2's main story campaign is about the same length as the first game. After that, read about how Dragon's Dogma 2 has an uncapped framerate but no visual presets or modes on consoles, and then check out this story about why Dragon's Dogma 2 has just one save file.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Senua's Saga: Hellblade II is right around the corner, hitting Xbox Series X/S exclusively on May 21, and ahead of the game's release, Ninja Theory has revealed it will have a dedicated photo mode. Plus, the studio released four new images of Hellblade II taken using the game's photo mode. 
While in-game photo modes are becoming the norm more and more with each new release, there are still some games that launch without one. With how good Hellblade II continues to look in trailers and screenshots, it's great to hear the game will feature this mode. 
Check out the four new Hellblade II images taken using the game's photo mode for yourself below: 

Based on the tweet revealing the photo mode, it sounds like players can expect it to launch with the game. 
"Photo mode returns in Senua's Saga: Hellblade II," a Ninja Theory tweet reads. "Here are some shot we took purely using photo mode in-game this week." 
Senua's Saga: Hellblade II hits Xbox Series X/S on May 21, 2024. 
For more about the game, watch the latest Senua's Saga: Hellblade II trailer, and then check out this gameplay trailer from December. After that, watch this other gameplay trailer for another look at the game's action.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Port-o-remaster publishers Aspyr yesterday launched the Star Wars: Battlefront Classic Collection, bundling together the two 'What if Battlefield but Star Wars?' shooters originally released by Pandemic Studios and LucasArts in 2004 and 2005 (not to be confused with Dice and EA's uncolonic Star Wars Battlefront games from the mid-tensies). It's one of those rereleases that exists mostly for modern consoles, made a bit useless on PC by the fact that you can still buy and fully play the originals for half the price. It's made even less useful by launching in a right wonky technical state, with bad lag, crashes, and reportedly only three 64-player servers online at first.

I don't mean to assume, but let's face it, it's probably your phone, where some idle doomscrolling likely awaits you, or some other, time-wasting distraction that will help fill the dead air between one task and the next. Well, While Waiting is a game that delves into precisely this fundamental human question: what is the best thing to do while waiting for something else to happen? It's from the makers of the very good puzzle game Moncage, and its newly released Steam demo is a pure, fidgety brilliance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My day in Lightyear Frontier starts out with a bit of farming. On a good day, it’s raining, so I don’t need to water the crops. On a bad day, there are weeds spontaneously spawning from the sky and I need to catch them before they land right on top of my precious plants. Either way, when I’m done, I’ll put the day’s harvest into the processing machines to work while I’m away, and then go exploring for minerals.
My goals are clear. I need to build a new machine, or upgrade my mech so that I can clean up a new area of the map and get new resources in return. Those will – you guessed it – let me build new machines or upgrade my mech again. There might be a few steps to juggle on the way, but nothing that needs me to hold long recipe flowcharts in my head. When I get back I’ll have everything I need to take the next step. It always feels like I’m making forward progress.

Having spent months of stubbornly maining Veteran and sticking as closely as possible to FPS convention, I’ve since found peace in the simple act of swinging knives/swords/giant electrified hammers into and through people. Mainly because it’s not so simple: for all its chaotic spectacle, the meleeing in Darktide (this month’s RPS Game Club star) works because it’s secretly been a rhythm game.

The deal apparently carried with it a $500 million price tag, according to a Bloomberg report.

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/03/14/disney-dreamlight-valley-dev-gameloft-making-dungeons-dragons-survival-sim-game"/>
        <updated>2024-03-14T18:43:15.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gameloft, the studio behind Disney Dreamlight Valley, has revealed it is partnering with Wizards of the Coast to create a new Dungeons & Dragons game. It's being developed for both consoles and PC and Gameloft describes it as an "innovative hybrid of survival, life simulation, and action RPG."
Disney Dreamlight Valley is popular in the life sim genre, mixing fun gameplay, unique customization, and Disney together into a package that players seem to really enjoy. It launched into Early Access back in 2022 before the full release debuted in December. All of this is to say: if you're a fan of Disney Dreamlight Valley and Dungeons & Dragons, there's a new game to keep an eye on. 
Currently untitled, Gameloft says in its announcement on Instagram that the game is set in the mythical Forgotten Realms, which is also the D&D setting Baldur's Gate 3 takes place in. The game, which will mix survival, life simulation, and action RPG elements into one, will feature "unique cooperative gameplay," the studio says. 
"Players can expect an adventure where the rich lore of this legendary franchise meets real-time strategy in a unique campaign of resilience, camaraderie, and danger at nearly every turn," the announcement reads." 
There's no name for the project and no release window either. Gameloft is currently hiring for the project. 
News of this D&D game arrives roughly a year after Wizards of the Coast, which owns the D&D IP and is a division within Hasbro, reportedly canceled five unannounced games. The last D&D game released was Dungeons & Dragons: Dark Alliance back in 2021 – read Game Informer's review of it here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Helldivers 2's Cutting Edge Premium warbond, aka DLC battle pass, is now available to buy in-game, and it is chock-full of oddball gadgetry such as lightning shotguns, burst-fire laser rifles and experimental armour. As with the Arc Thrower stratagem, the lightning shotgun fires arcs of electricity that conduct between players and enemies alike, but there's a fresh armour perk, Electrical Conduit, which reduces arc damage by 95%, allowing close-knit teams of Helldivers to roll around the battlefield frazzling themselves without much penalty. 
Still, I think the real star pick here is surely the Localization Confusion booster, which extends the time between enemy spawns, allowing weirdo solo players such as myself to disentangle from a dragged-out gunfight a little more gracefully.

In fairness, the newly revealed Open (or Opthreen), an RPO-themed metaverse battle royale thing, does look, sound, feel, and smell horrible, so a solid chunk of this week’s Electronic Wireless Show podcast is just us despairing over it. But there’s also some honest-to-goodness games chat, as we field a question from EWS listener Pete (thanks Pete!) on the games our younger selves were parentally forbidden from playing – and how we feel about them as ostensible grownups.

That changed today, as Sega and Rovio announced a multi-game crossover event between Sonic and Angry Birds on mobile devices.
The crossover event even comes with its own storyline, which includes a plot to steal the Angry Birds' eggs that accidentally creates a portal between the world of Angry Birds and Sonic's world. Sonic, Red, and their friend groups must work together across five mobile titles to stop Dr. Eggman. The event will include new playable characters, cross-brand c…]]></summary>

They don't have much more to share about the game, not even a name, so presumably it won't be out for some time. Whatever it might be, it's headed to PC and consoles.

While Embracer have yet to actually state this out loud, it sounds like the KOTOR remake will be a "joint project" between Saber and Embracer. It also probably won't be out in the next 12 months. Given the project's repeated disruptions and delays, I suspect many of us will settle for the game coming out at all.

That's according to a new "Notice of End of Sales" post on the game's Steam page. From Friday, March 29, 2024, onward, the game will no longer be available for purchase in Japan on the storefront. 
However, online play will remain available after the game's delisting, and purchased copies of the collection will remain available for re-download from the Steam store. 
Released less than two years ago on August 30, 2022, on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC, The Cowabunga Collection getting delisted so soon comes as a shock.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cast your eye over the original Outcast from 1999 today, and you'll find a world that's more abstract than alien. Hazy, almost block colour textures are stretched to breaking point over terrain that looks like it's been pulled and poked by a child sculpting in putty slime, while its cast of beige, three-fingered Talans are so rigid that they'd all be reigning champions at the local robot dance-off. Understandable, given the era in which is was made, but even so - what a difference 25 years make. Even after 2017's remake glow-up with Outcast: Second Contact, A New Beginning's version of Adelpha is a lush and verdant paradise, with treetops soaring over your head, and mountains requiring several triple or quadruple jetpack jumps to traverse. It's no Avatar: Frontiers Of Pandora, admittedly, but it leans in very much the same direction, punching your eyeballs with such bright, primary colours that you'll feel enticed to explore every inch of it.
A shame, then, that all its visual splendour amounts to is little more than an empty husk filled with open world busy work that already felt tired and done ten years ago. Its non-linear approach to storytelling remains intact, letting you tackle the quests and problems of its numerous village settlements in any order you wish, but even this has been boiled down to tedious checklists of fetch quests, escort missions and shooting up the same identikit facility one after another. Topping off this fatal combo is returning protagonist Cutter Slade, whose macho army dude dial is still set firmly to cringey wise-cracking and patronising stereotypes. A new beginning this ain't.

After starting Jagex in 1999, the Gower brothers focused their efforts on the studio's first big release: RuneScape. The rest is history. RuneScape is still a very popular game today, both in its modern form and as Old School RuneScape. The Gowers left Jagex in 2010 and little was known about what they were up to until now. It turns out Andrew Gower was working as the lead designer on their new game, while Paul Gower was working as the narrative designer for it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the wake of its one-week lawsuit targeting the Yuzu Switch emulator, Nintendo is back to clean up the house. The company has just shut down around 30 GitHub repos offering circumvention tools with attempts to evade liability given short shrift. One Nintendo takedown notice makes it clear that, even when people link to a third-party site that hosts tools available via different links, it still amounts to trafficking in circumvention devices under the DMCA.

For several months, the movie has been widely available on pirate sites too. While one might think that all demand would be satisfied, winning the Oscar for 'Best Picture' more than doubled the interest on pirate sites this week. The same Oscar boost affects other titles as well.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Ubisoft Montpellier's excellent metroidvania, Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, hit consoles and PC in January, and it's still one of Game Informer's top scoring reviews of the year. You can read Game Informer's Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown review here to find out why we love it so much. Now, Ubisoft is giving players another reason to jump back in with a new post-launch content roadmap. 
What's more, all of the new content coming to the game is set to release throughout the year, starting with new Speedrun and Permadeath modes this month as well as new outfits for Sargon. In spring, a Boss Rush will be released alongside even more outfits for Sargon, and in summer, the Divine Trials update brings new combat, platform, and puzzle challenges as well as new amulets, outfits, and more. All of this will be free, too. 
However, later in 2024, new paid story DLC will hit Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, although Ubisoft offers no teases about what to expect. 
It's an exciting roadmap, doubly so considering the majority of the new content is free. 
For more, read Game Informer's Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown review, and then check out our breakdown of the four ways Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown gets the metroidvania genre right. After that, check out this guide about how to beat Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown's hardest platforming challenge.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In some respects, Helldivers 2 did come as a bit of surprise. Not a huge amount of marketing, no betas, and review codes didn't go out until it basically launched. Before it landed on my PC, there was a small part of me that thought it was going to be a rocky ride with severe performance issues or the like. Nope! It's easily slid into one of my favourite games of the year without question, and presumably, for the hundreds of thousands of others who've also opted into preserving democracy.
But there seems to be this sentiment that Helldivers 2's roaring success has come as a shock, so much of a shock that top execs and investors are doing YouTube thumbnail faces in boardrooms with mini-nuke explosions erupting from their heads. Should its success come as that much of a surprise, though? No, probably not.

This was surprising, because while I'd been broadly positive about the vibes of Vampire Therapist, I was reasonably concerned about the specifics of how it would all shake down. But it turned out that the critical perspective was something Nemati appreciated, and so we had a chat that dug down into the meat of it all. Although I was initially interested in how he'd come up with the idea of a vampire therapist, it turns out all roads lead back to Twilight's Edward Cullen.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Helldivers 2 developer Arrowhead Game Studios quietly snuck flying Terminid bugs into the game in the latest update, it seems. Windows Central noticed flying Shrieker bugs are enemies that appear on planets plagued with Terminids and while official accounts for the game play coy, more and more players are running into them. 
It seems the Shriekers were added with Patch 1.000.102, which went live yesterday. Coincidentally, that patch was centered on Terminids and nerfing spawn rates for Bile Titans and Chargers on the harder difficulties of Helldivers 2. Windows Central reports Shriekers only appear when a "Shrieker Lair" is one of the side objectives on a planet, noting they look like "smaller versions of the mushroom-like Spore Towers that perpetually keep a large area around them covered in a thick haze." 


Shrieker Lairs, like the Spore Towers and Terminid egg nests can be destroyed up close and from afar with a well-placed rocket, grenade, or strategem. 
Keep your eyes on the skies, Helldivers and remember...DEMOCRACY.
For more about the game, read Game Informer's Helldivers 2 review, and then read about a recent patch that introduced meteor showers and fire tornadoes to the game. After that, check out the Cutting Edge Warbond coming to the game tomorrow.

Discord will let all developers make their own Activities, wanting to jam in more games and social hangout experiences and stuff. I'm broadly up for things removing faff from getting casual hangout games running with pals.

Chandlers's trademark "blonde to make a bishop kick a hole in a stained-glass window" kind of zingers are very hard to do well, so it's better to say you're doing Philip Marlow badly on purpose. The trailer for Nobody Wants To Die seems like it's self-seriousness is actually self-awareness. I mean, I kind of refuse to believe that hard-boiled future crime detective James Karra saying "I'm in the business of secrets... But it's more of an addiction... And I like 'em straight... No chaser..." while sipping from a glass of amber liquor isn't indulging in some amount of winking and nudging.

        <updated>2024-03-13T15:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sabotage Studio has teased a new three-player co-op mode for its 2023 RPG Sea of Stars alongside news the game has surpassed 5 million players in less than a year. This new mode, dubbed Single Player+, lets three players journey together through the story of Sea of Stars, and it will feature new traversal and combat mechanics to accommodate playing with friends. 
Sabotage announced this news today with a special teaser trailer you can watch below. In it, you'll get a glimpse of what Sea of Stars' Single Player+ mode looks like, how it works, and what to expect. Check it out: 


"Staying true to the game's core turn-based roots, each player will engage in traversal and combat with a new 'co-op timed hits' mechanic as they embark with friends on Sea of Stars' grand adventure," a press release reads. "The new mode is currently in development and more details are set to be released soon." 
As you can see, Sabotage isn't quite ready to reveal when this new mode will hit the game. After all, the team is still working on Throes of the Watchmaker, a new DLC coming to the game sometime in the future. 
For more about the game, read Game Informer's Sea of Stars review, and then read Game Informer's Sea of Stars cover story for behind-the-scenes details about the game's development.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlayStation is rolling out a new update for the PlayStation 5 that enhances audio on the DualSense controller, adds new Share Screen features, and more. This update was in beta last month but rolls out for everyone starting today. 
The biggest features are coming to the PS5's DualSense controller. The built-in speakers can now produce higher volume sound, which PlayStation says will allow players to hear in-game sounds and voice chat audio more clearly. Plus, the noise cancellation on the controller's built-in mic has been improved. 


"The mic input quality on these controllers has been improved, courtesy of a new A.I. machine learning model," a PlayStation Blog post reads. "Background noise from button presses and game audio are suppressed, resulting in a better voice chat experience."
Share Screen is also getting some new features with today's update. Namely, viewers can move a pointer around and send a ping or draw a line on a shared screen, allowing them to highlight objects in-game or guide a player. Plus, viewers can now send emoji-based reactions to the host's screen – these features are turned off by default and the host and viewer must turn them on. PlayStation says these Share Screen features will hit the PS App, which also allows Share Screen, later this month. 
Finally, today's update allows users to adjust the brightness of the PS5 power indicator. Simply go to Settings, then Beep and Light, and then Brightness.

Draw from enough unique inspirations, and eventually, a game begins to feel entirely novel. That’s the sensation that emerges as you play Unicorn Overlord, Vanillaware’s vast fantasy adventure of tactics, strategy, and storytelling. I was consistently reminded of other systems and mechanics from prior genre releases, but the resulting combination felt consistently original and entertaining, even after many hours of battle and exploration.

        <updated>2024-03-12T16:25:39.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you ask any Final Fantasy fan what their top five favorite songs in the franchise are, there's a 99 percent chance one of them is "To Zanarkand" from Final Fantasy X. However, it turns out, it wasn't originally intended for the game. 
This news comes from Audrey (aitaikimochi on X, formerly Twitter), a mega Final Fantasy fan, Twitch streamer, and CEO of Aitai Japan Inc., who translated a recent interview between Weekly Ochiai and Final Fantasy X composer Nobuo Uematsu, whose credits also include One-Winged Angel and Aerith's Theme from Final Fantasy VII and so much more. In that interview, Uematsu revealed "To Zanarkand" originally began as a piece for a French flute player, meant to be played during a recital. 


"'To Zanarkand' was actually not meant to be the theme for Final Fantasy X," Uematsu tells Weekly Ochiai, as translated by Audrey on X. "There was a flute player from France who originally asked me to write a song for them to play during a recital. When I wrote the piece, I thought perhaps this sounded a bit too sad for a recital. So I set it aside for the time being. 
"Sometime after, when I was making the score of Final Fantasy X, I was falling behind all the while the producers were hounding me. So since that flute piece was unused, I just kind of meekly handed it to them. They listened to it and said, 'Yes! This is brilliant!'" 
In retrospect, it's wild "To Zanarkand" wasn't originally composed by Uematsu for Final Fantasy X because it fits the game's themes so well, nailing the somber and sad tone present throughout Tidus and Yuna's journey in Spira. 
For more about Final Fantasy music, read Game Informer's exclusive four-part series on composer Masayoshi Soken's score for last year's Final Fantasy XVI:
Part 1: Creating The Prelude
Part 2: The Victory Fanfare
Part 3: Finding A Main Theme
Part 4: The Sound

        <updated>2024-03-12T14:16:59.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Starbreeze Studios CEO Tobias Sjögren is no longer with the studio and the Payday 3 developer is now recruiting for a new leader. This news comes from a recent notice to investors that explains board member Juergen Goeldner is taking over as interim CEO in the meantime, as reported by GameDeveloper. 
While Starbreeze's messaging around Sjögren's leave isn't super clear – the team simply says it is bidding farewell to the former CEO – today's news arrives after Payday 3 failed to meet expectations, according to GameDeveloper. 


"On behalf of the board of directors, I would like to thank Tobias Sjögren for his achievements during the past three years," board chairman Torgny Hellström writes in the notice to investors. "Tobias took over the helm of Starbreeze in a challenging phase of its journey and we wish him well in his future endeavors."
Goeldner, the new interim CEO, adds, "Starbreeze has a strong history of developing and publishing games globally. After launching Payday 3, the company is well-positioned to leverage the strengths of the organization to monetize and develop the IP portfolio. I am looking forward to assuming an operative position and, together with the management, ensure the execution of this strategy."
Goeldner has 40 years of experience in the games industry, including several executive positions, according to the notice. His last executive position was as CEO of Focus Home Interactive. He has been a member of Starbreeze's board of directors since last year. Starbreeze has initiated a recruitment process for a permanent CEO. 


Payday 3 hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on September 21. We enjoyed the game around launch, giving it an 8 out of 10 in the Game Informer Payday 3 review. More than 3 million people played Payday 3 in its first month, but the game still failed to meet the expectations of the studio.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For the 17th time, ScummVM has again been accepted for the Google Summer of Code program this summer.
The program intends to bring new contributors into open source projects. In the most recent two years this has included both students and non-students as eligible candidates for participation.
Like last year, participants can apply for working on either short tasks (about 175 hours of work), or large tasks (about 350 hours of work). The coding period typically runs from start of June through August, but there is some flexibility which allows participants to have longer time frames if they are unable to work full time through the summer.
ScummVM is looking for people interested in participating in GSoC with us. A list of suggested projects can be found on this page, but we are also open to your own ideas as well. Please provide the required information in your application before submitting.
We also strongly encourage you to join our Discord server, in the #scummvm-gsoc channel. This allows you to engage with our mentors and the rest of the team, to get advice about how to get involved with the project, as well as writing your application.
Based on our previous 16 years of experience with GSoC, we have put together a Google Summer of Code miniportal to help you get started.
Looking forward to hearing from you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you don’t know me, I’m Owen Rudge, and have been involved in the online Transport Tycoon community for almost 25 years. Exactly 21 years ago, I received an ICQ message (look it up, kids) out of the blue from a guy named Ludvig Strigeus (nicknamed Ludde). “Hello, you probably don’t know me, but I’ve been working on a project to clone TTD for a while.” he said, more or less. He didn’t want to release this to the public yet, and wasn’t entirely sure what he was going to do with it. (He’d been working on it since 30th June 2002, so I guess that is technically the birthday of what would become OpenTTD…) Ludde sent me a copy of what he’d been working on, and it was very exciting indeed. It was a fully functional version of Transport Tycoon Deluxe, written in C. Admittedly incomplete at that time, it was still quite remarkable.]]></summary>
