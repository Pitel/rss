        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Early on in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, after gaining access to the open world, you'll overhear a merchant talking about losing control of his cart near a lake and it tipping over. Sounds like an opportunity! Here's where to find the merchant's tipped cart in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2.

Where to find the merchant's overturned cart


Even though you likely heard about this tipped cart in Troskowitz, you'll want to start in Tachov for the fastest route to the merchant's overturned cart. Head west out of Tachov and follow the dirt road all the way until it winds down a small embankment to a flowing river. On the bank, you'll immediately see the overturned cart.


As you get closer to the exact location of the merchant's tipped cart, which you can see on the map above, you'll also see an icon popup in-game indicating the Overturned cart is there.


What should you do with the tipped cart?


Finding the merchant's tipped cart isn't directly part of a side quest or anything, but near the overturned cart are some helpful goodies, especially for early in the game. First off, you'll notice some Cabbage immediately in the cart and floating around nearby. Pick these up as food is important in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, and Cabbage are nice for cooking some tasty recipes!


Next, look in the nearby chests and barrels floating in the water for some extra useful goods. The barrel located immediately to the left of the cart, floating in the water, actually has a few consumable potions inside including a couple of the very valuable Saviour Schnapps. These incredibly useful consumables are actually how you create manual saves in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, so finding this alone made the trip to find where the merchant's tipped cart was well worth the adventure!

However, you won't be able to play the game in this reality, as the project has officially been canceled. Developers Sports Interactive announced the unfortunate decision earlier today, February 6, and the much-delayed title has finally been binned.


Why has Football Manager 25 been canceled?


Football Manager 25, or FM 25 in short, was expected to be the series's biggest technical and visual advancement, as it would have been based on the Unity engine. Unfortunately, the massive shift seems to have been too big a challenge for the developers to conquer.

Sega and Sports Interactive have officially cancelled Football Manager 25 after extensive internal discussion and careful consideration.
Sports Interactive says it's "very sorry" to have let down fans and will now shift its focus to the next annual release. The reasoning behind this decision, although it's not specifically mentioned, seems to be the transition to the new game engine. It was planned to be the "biggest technical and visual advancement in the series for a generation" laying the foundations for a new era.

Best DNS servers for gaming


Here are five reliable DNS servers to use for your gaming needs.


Google 



Primary - 8.8.8.8


Secondary - 8.8.4.4



Google has been the most consistent over the years, good for fixing some latency issues, having solid security, and being more widely available. 


On top of that, it has one of the simpler inputs, especially when putting this into your console’s DNS settings.


The only glaring issue for many is the matter of privacy.

Marvel Rivals' new patch fixes crippling glitches affecting Venom

Since launch, Venom has sat comfortably at or near the top of Marvel Rivals' meta, and as a Venom main, I agree with the consensus on this one. Recently, though, I and other Venom players have had issues with Spider-Man's perennial rivals' signature abilities.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Who doesn't love a good roadmap? Rabbit & Bear Studios, the folks behind Suikoden spiritual successor Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes, just laid out one of their own with dates for three upcoming story expansions.


Players won't have to wait too long for the updates, each focusing on one of three main characters. It all starts on February 27 with The Chapter of Marisa, a Marisa-centric expansion that spins a yarn about the character's encounter with an enchanted girl. What happens when the pair set out to dig through the secrets of the "Child of the Rune," and what sinister forces are at work behind the scenes?


After that, we have The Chapter of Seign to look forward to on March 13, tasking Seign with handling an issue within the Galdean empire. The Chapter of Markus closes things out on April 3, as Markus, Carrie, and Nowa investigate the strange realm beyond a newly unlocked teleportation gateway.

All three chapters will be available on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC. If you fancy continuing your adventure over the next few months, the story expansions will be priced at $7.99 each.


It's also worth noting that, according to the latest Kickstarter update, these scenarios are the last parts of the game that Suikoden and Eiyuden Chronicles creator Yoshitaka Murayama worked on directly. The industry veteran passed away on February 6, 2024, after dealing with "complications with an ongoing illness." Maruyama was very enthusiastic about the project, so it will no doubt be worth seeing how his final pieces of input shaped the DLC to come.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you've been eagerly looking to play Avowed at 60fps at launch, there is some good news and some bad news.


Obsidian's upcoming project will be able to run at 60fps at launch on the Xbox Series X. That said, the performance you might get could fall way below your expectations if the game's director, Carrie Patel, is to be believed.


Avowed will finally run at 60 fps at launch on Xbox Series X


Talking on the MinnMax podcast, Patel said players can play the game on 60fps.



"You can get up to 60[fps]"




This news will be huge for those who will be playing on the Xbox Series X. Last time, Obsidian made it clear that Avowed will only run at 30fps at launch on the Xbox Series X. This news did disappoint some, as the Series X is the beefier console (compared to Series S).




Back then, the devs claimed that the game had become "a lot juicier" in development. This was cited as the main reason behind the limitation on frames per second. Something has definitely changed since, and players will be able to access higher fps, but there's a catch.



"You gotta accept a little jank to do something fun and creative, I think."




Hence, it's safe to assume that running the game at 60fps might be possible, but it might feel unoptimized. That said, it's still better that Series X users will at least have the feature to try and enjoy Avowed with higher fps. Any optimization issues are likely going to be sorted by Obsidian post-launch.


The upcoming title will be released on February 18 after a long delay (it was originally scheduled to launch towards the end of 2024). If you choose to purchase the Premium Edition, you can start your journey on February 13. The game will also be available from day one on the Xbox Game Pass Ultimate.

You can rest or sleep in a bed to regain health, but you aren't always near a town or haystack to sleep off your wounds. You need to rely on the Marigold Decoction potion.


The Marigold Decoction potion is the primary way to restore Henry's health. While you can eat some food or drink water to gain a little bit back, you also run the risk of getting the overeating debuff, which puts you in a different kind of pickle. Marigold Decoctions have no downside, healing Henry for a percentage of his health over time.


Unfortunately, Marigold Decoctions are incredibly difficult to get hold of, so how do you consistently add them to your inventory in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2?

The real question is: does she bring enough value to your account to justify the investment?


Is Roccia Worth Pulling in Wuthering Waves?


Roccia enters Wuthering Waves at an intriguing point in the meta. She is the best-in-slot (BiS) sub-DPS for two of the game’s most powerful damage dealers, Camellya and Havoc Rover. Her Concerto rotation is incredibly fast, and she boasts the best grouping abilities in the game by a significant margin. With all these strengths, why are some players hesitant to pull for her?


The answer is simple: competition.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Most 5-star characters in Genshin Impact are limited, meaning they’re only obtainable during specific event banners. However, a select few are relegated to the standard pool, giving players a chance to pull the character even when they’re not featured. Is Yumemizuki Mizuki fated to be limited or standard?


Mizuki will be a standard 5-star character


HoYoverse confirmed during a version preview that Yumemizuki Mizuki will be added to the standard 5-star character pool. This means her upcoming banner in the first half of Version 5.4 will likely be the only dedicated event banner for Mizuki. After her banner comes to an end, you’ll have a small chance to obtain her on other limited character banners, on the standard banner, or on Chronicled Wish banners.


Screenshot by Destructoid


Does this mean Mizuki will be bad?


Those who were around during the Dehya debacle might be anxious at this news. Standard 5-star characters range from fairly decent (Tighnari, Jean) to outright terrible (Dehya, Qiqi). Being added to the standard pool is a portent of mediocrity. Dehya, the most recent character to make her way to the standard banner, is notorious for being particularly weak.


Mizuki will likely never reach the power level of Mavuika or Neuvillette, but she doesn’t seem to be bad either. From what we’ve seen so far, Mizuki will have a unique kit, be easy to build, and work with many teammates. If you like Mizuki and want to play a Swirl DPS, then Mizuki will be a perfectly fine pull.


That being said, unless you really like Mizuki, I recommend holding off on her limited event banner. Save your precious Primogems for a character you love, and you might accidentally get Mizuki along the way. Emphasis on “might.” It took me more than two years of playing Genshin Impact to get my first Mona.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Reload!
Developer M2 and publisher Taito have today announced that the '80s arcade compilation title Operation Night Strikers will also receive a Switch release at some point this year.
This one was initially announced for Steam back in November, but a blog post on the Taito website confirmed that the Nintendo hybrid will also be included in the collection's release plans — it feels like a good fit, if you ask us.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Unmatched is a game for fans of tabletop miniature skirmish games or anyone who spends their free time thinking about impossible fighting matchups – like the teenage mutant ninja turtles versus the dinosaurs from Jurassic Park. 


Each Unmatched box comes with a set of combatants, a deck of ability cards, and maps for staging your epic tabletop battles. The sets run the pop culture gamut from Marvel heroes to mythological figures and even some historically renowned fighters. Witcher fans can get in on the action by checking out two different box sets that introduce six characters to the Unmatched battle system.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The outcome of most quests in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 will decide how the story evolves, and you'll want to pay strong attention to the points of no return.


The points of no return represent certain stages in the main campaign from where you won't be able to backtrack. In simpler words, any side quests left incomplete till this stage will remain as such, so you must finish them before reaching the stages.


Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 points of no return explained


The two points of no return are decided by the regions available in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2. The first point of no return is available in the Trosky region. It's tied with the Necessary Evil quest, which is part of the main storyline.


Before you begin this quest, make sure to complete every side mission available in the Trosky region. Of course, you don't need to complete all of them, but any you leave out will remain like that. Not only will you miss out on the completion rewards, but a part of the lore will also remain out of your access on that particular save.

The second point of no return is part of the Kuttenburg region, and it appears before you start the Oratores quest. Like Necessary Evil, Oratores is part of the main questline as well. Similar to the previous one, you must finish all side quests available at the Kuttenburg region. Any that you leave unfinished will remain so in your playthrough.


If you're focusing entirely on the main campaign, you'll be able to complete the game quicker. However, you'll be losing out on a lot of fun, as the lore really kicks strong after the first few quests. You'll also progress slower as completing the side missions will help you to gain more in-game experience and other valuable resources like Groschen.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Zambo Anguissa Serie A POTM SBC is now live in EA FC 25, and you can complete the challenge to unlock a special item in Ultimate Team.


This is by far the best Zambo Anguissa item you can use in Ultimate Team. To play with the card, you'll have to complete all the challenges of the SBC. Let's take a look at how to complete the challenge and see if the new Anguissa item is worth your fodder at all.


EA FC 25 Zambo Anguissa Serie A POTM SBC tasks


The Zambo Anguissa Serie A POTM SBC has three different tasks, and here are the requirements.


Task 1 - Serie A



Min. 1 Players from: Serie A TIM


Min. Team Rating: 84



Task 2 - Top Form



Min. 1 Players: Team of the Week


Min. Team Rating: 86



Task 3 - 87-Rated Squad



Min. Team Rating: 87



EA FC 25 Zambo Anguissa Serie A POTM SBC solutions


Here's a set of solutions you can use to complete all three tasks in EA FC 25.


Task 1 - Serie A



Any 10 84-rated items


Thuram 83



Task 2 - Top Form



Any 87-rated TOTW item


Olmo 84


Chawinga 84


Vlahovic 84


Dovbyk 84


Karchaoui 87


Aleix Garcia 84


de Jong 87


Popp 87


Koulibaly 84


Modric 86



Task 3 - 87-Rated Squad



Osimhen 87


Palmer 85


Musiala 87


Pedri 86


Pajor 87


Mateo 85


Gabriel 86


Hansen 90


Girellli 85


Bruno Fernandes 87


Grimaldo 86



This Anguissa card offers tremendous value if you're looking for a defensively solid midfielder. He has three different roles++ and double playstyle+. Both Relentless+ and Intercept+ are crucial for the CDM position, as is the presence of Anticipate playstyle.


His Pace (84) is slightly on the lower side of things, but he makes up for it with 86 Dribbling, 87 Defense, and 95 Physicality. For 160,000 coins worth of fodder, the SBC is an absolute bargain, and a future evolution will only improve the card further.

Unfortunately, even though you can learn how to play using each style, some of them are just overall better than others, hence the gacha and the rarity system. Knowing this, here's our Tier list of all Styles in Kuroku's Basket Showdown.

We were never lucky enough to land a Switch port of the acclaimed 2016 puzzle adventure The Witness, though the hybrid has managed to scratch that itch with a few titles in the years since (Memorrha, Botany Manor, etc.). Taiji is another one that we'd bundle into this group, a 2D open-world puzzler that arrives on the eShop on 25th February.
The game's solo developer, Matthew VanDevander, was very open about its Witness inspiration when it launched on Steam back in 2022, and we can see why. This is a game where you explore a mysterious world, solving a series of grid-based puzzles as you go. Taiji switches The Witness' first-person perspective to a top-down, 2D pixel art, but the answers-hidden-in-plain-sight approach is all still present and correct.

In Keep Driving, a turn-based RPG of swishing scenery and smooshed roadkill, you are on a road trip in the early 2000s that will see you gulping coffee and stuffing cheap snacks into your mouth, all in an effort to get to the other side of the country in time for the big concert. It is a hypnotically involving game of picking up hitchhikers and battling tailgaters, a pixel art drivealong with tactile, chunky buttons and perfectly suited sound effects, as much fuelled by nostalgia as it is by gasoline. At first, I thought it was too loose and open-ended to elicit any deep feelings. But then I had to sell my guitar for half a tank of petrol, just to visit my dying grandmother. Dude, this is a game that goes places.

Less blowing, actually. More taunting me from my screen maddeningly like a middle finger salute from a man with no hands. It was a baffling piece of licensed merch from Disco Elysium studio ZA/UM and Atelier, who I assume are three hyenas in a board room sniffing each other's crotches for eternity.
I couldn't tell you exactly where I first saw the bag - which has actually been on sale for a few months now - but I soon realised why it had likely entered the zeitgeist again: an extensive set of a documentary podcasts by YouTube creator The 41st Precinct, the latest of which interviews writers Dora Klindžić and Argo Tuulik for more time than I have ever spent on anything. Here's a clip on Atelier and that fucking bag.

Nintendo's brand synergy goes deep. Real deep. If visiting Super Nintendo World at Universal Studios Japan wasn't enough Mario for you, you can now rent an Alarmo for the night at some of the park's hotels so you can even have Nintendo on the mind while you sleep.
In a post on Nintendo's Japanese website, the company revealed that it was partnering with Universal Studios to bring Alarmo rentals to seven different hotels. The rental package includes an Alarmo and an AC adapter for plugging it in, both of which can be collected from the hotel reception desk, the post claims.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[True to the word of Capcom’s German social media marketing, Monster Hunter Wilds has a new, generally less extravagant set of PC system requirements ahead of its February 28th launch. There’s also a standalone benchmark tool that you can download from the game’s Steam page, so you can see for yourself how the beast-biffing RPG will run on your hardware.
In theory, these are great developments. Lower requirements mean a more widely accessible game, and the benchmark tool – which covers a good six minutes of combined cinematics and simulated free roaming – brings reassurance and accountability to this otherwise hype-reliant prerelease period. Sadly, there are two problems. One, the benchmark confirms outright that Monster Hunter Wilds will run like stagnant goulash on low-end PCs, and two, it does so to the extent that I’m not sure that the revised minimum specs are even reliable.

It sounds like you'll still be the sweaty cybermaster of a bunch of glitchy drones, who now might suffer "fun personality quirks" when you install upgrades, "like not wanting to go down narrow corridors because it's now claustrophobic".

To a normal person, adding a 2 to the end of your game's name is the sign of a sequel. But as the attendant decimal and zero suggest, it's not clear if that's exactly what he means. It could mean a revamp with new features, or some other new direction for the existing game. His later words do make it sound more like this is what EA have in mind.

Ahead of the release of Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition next month, Nintendo has supposedly updated the file size of the Switch release.
Listings online previously suggested the game would take up around 15 GB of space and now the estimated file size on the Switch eShop says the game will require an installation of 13.4 GB (thanks, necrolipe). So it seems Monolith Soft and Nintendo have found a way to save some space! In comparison, the Wii U version was around 20+ GB all up.

Well, here's something we weren't exactly expecting - Nintendo has today released a Switch eShop demo for Donkey Kong Country Returns HD.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I’ve had enough of fighting the dogs in a respectable, straightforward manner, I pick them up with my mind and - with a casualness that has to be extremely insulting if you’re a dog - drop them directly off a cliff. This ends the fight immediately. Sometimes I resort to this low move out of frustration, when a dull fight has dragged on for too long. Sometimes I resort to it out of panic, because I’ve accidentally set fire to every hard surface within ten feet, or frozen myself to a wall. Often it’s just for the pleasure of it. 

In Eternal Strands, Yellow Brick Games’ debut title, you play the leader of a "weaver band", a crew of freelance magicians, in a world where something extremely bad happened to magic. Some years ago, the Enclave, a city state acting as the isolationist heart of the world’s magic, exploded in a kind of power surge - one part tsunami, one part blown fuse - and just as quickly sealed itself off from the world outside. Somehow managing to breach the wall, your band finds themselves the first people to set foot inside the ruined capital since the calamity and sets about uncovering the mystery of what exactly went wrong.

Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 has earned Playable status on the Steam Deck, and it’s a shrewd assessment on Valve’s part: there are some shortcomings that keep the coveted Verified badge out of Deliverance 2’s reach, most notably its cramped UI, but I’ve been bumbling around the medieval RPG for hours now and it is indeed plenty functional in handheld mode. Despite its system requirements arguably suggesting otherwise, it can even manage some decent 40fps-plus performance without dumping all the quality settings to their lowest.

While Dell has got some overpriced $5000+ Alienware 51 desktops up for preorder, there other (considerably cheaper, but not necessarily affordable) options up for grabs right now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Vendrán Las Aves - "The Birds Will Come" - is a brief, quiet, hopeful game about burnout recovery. Summarised as a "slice of life tamagotchi" and available in Spanish and English, it's a gamejam production from Francisco Riolobos, Chuso Montero and Deconstructeam, the Valencia-based developers behind The Red String Club and The Cosmic Wheel Sisterhood.
It's free to download from Itch.io, and takes the form of a snowglobe perspective of somebody's one-room apartment. The person in question has just left their job after a rough spell, and has impulsively bought a guitar. They are also, however, totally exhausted, with barely the willpower to do anything beyond getting out of bed, let alone make music. Your task is to help them through each day and rebuild their morale till they feel able to pluck a few chords.

Wreckfest 2 is the follow-up to smashing racer Wreckfest, which came out in 2018 but which I only discovered last year while listing our best racing games. My friends, it got on the list. Developers Bugbear say they have "overhauled its physics engine to deliver the most intense crashes, deeper component damage, and absolute vehicular mayhem." We can see a little bit of that in a new trailer below, which also gives us an exact early access release date.

Secondly, a mildly terrifying moment in a dugout when a wounded soldier I was supposed to be treating struck a T-pose, as though afflicted by lightning early onset arthritis.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Civilization 7, if it’s anything like past games in the 4X strategy series, will play just fine with a single mouse in one hand. And while it’s coming to console with bindings for controllers, a mouse will still be many people’s preferred way to play. What if the Switch 2 Joy-Con can also double as PC gaming mice?

Terry Cavanagh, also the maker of VVVVVV and Dicey Dungeons, is releasing a collection of his freeware bits and bobs on Steam next week, called simply Terry's Other Games. Looking at the games included, it summons a nostalgic giggle just to see just how many of Terry's short games have been intriguing enough to grab the eye of an RPS writer over the years.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Peter Akemann - co-founder of Call Of Duty's Treyarch and recent president of The Walking Dead: Saints & Sinners studio Skydance Interactive - has pleaded guilty to crashing a drone into a firefighting plane assisting with the recent LA wildfires. The crash, which grounded the plane by damaging its left wing, occurred after Akemann ignored temporary drone restrictions in order to survey the Palisades fires before losing control. Thanks, Eurogamer. For first noticing the case, I mean. I'm not blaming Eurogamer for the drone crash. Not this one, anyway.
The drone was traced back to Akemann, who has agreed to plead guilty to one count of unsafe operation of an unmanned aircraft. That's a misdemeanour that usually carries up to one year prison time, but he's "hoping to escape the prison term in exchange for 150 hours of community service in support of wildfire relief and the approximately $65,000 USD it cost to repair the plane," write Eurogamer, as part of a plea agreement.

He's co-developing this with Evil Gingerbread Studio but his other big project is the Total War: Warhammer III overhaul mod SFO, and it seems barely a month passes without some huge update to that. Venris once told me he mods for around "eight to 12 hours a day", though, so I suppose I shouldn't be surprised that this cult-shepherding roguelite is now available in Steam early access. Edwin described it as "Darkest Dungeon, but you're running the dungeon". That's better than anything I could come up with, so let's stick with that.

"Frittte brings reassurance that the bag will serve your everyday needs on the toughest streets."
This nod to people whose main takeaway from Fight Club was how rad Brad Pitt's taste in shirts was is being sold by ZA/UM's collobrative merch store with company Atelier. They've previously put out things like a replica of Kim Kitsuragi's jacket. I'm not going to link them, as a pathetic act of rebellion.
As the man who couldn't afford an ambulance to get the gash on his head sewn up once said, let's try and keep an open mind about this. The bag's Dyneema fabric "is up to 15x stronger than steel on a weight-for-weight basis and provides the highest tear and tensile strength of any competing materials".

A clip of loud wreckage, gunfire, and bazooka'd buildings has fallen dustily into our lap via a promotional video for Battlefield 6 (or whatever the developers plan to call the next of these large-scale first-person shooters). Mostly, it's a lot of producers talking a big game about "levelling up" the "core experience", which seems to remain blasting a building you don't like with a rocket-propelled grenade. We can tell from the final 10 seconds of the video, which show some of the game's actual running and/or gunning.

She greets him like a nobleman. I have Henry push back. He's a blacksmith's son. He might have some blue blood care of his biological father, but he grew up in the soot and clamour of the forge. The girl nervously insists, however: Henry must be from the upper crust, or he wouldn't have been welcomed and feasted by the lord of the estate. He wouldn't be lying in his very own chamber with its very own hole for shitting in - and in any case, it's more than her job's worth to treat him otherwise. In a timid, not quite spiteful show of reverse class policing, she refuses to end the dialogue until she's dismissed in a manner befitting her station.

Resident Evil 4, Fallout 3, Gears Of War - all bleary examples of a grubby visual style. This peaked in Clive Barker's Jericho, a shooter so desaturated it felt like the colour settings on your monitor were banjaxed. I have heard this called "the piss filter" and generally lamented in industry circles. But it was always a puposeful choice, intended to add some grittiness to the world. And there's at least one developer who is reviving "smeared dirt" as an art direction. As Time Surrenders is a very brown stealth game that takes a lot of inspiration from Metal Gear Solid V.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nvidia DLSS 4 has launched under not-terribly-happy circumstances. It’s a mostly AI-powered technology at a time when mistrust in artificial intelligence, fuelled by underbaked applications and anti-creative policies, is at all-time high – not to mention how the new GeForce GPUs it’s released alongside, the RTX 5080 and RTX 5090, have immediately entered 2020-style stock shortage purgatory.
However, having tried it out in a few different games, I suspect time will prove kinder to DLSS 4 than the RTX 50 series launch has been. It is, in fact, a rather nifty collection of upscaling improvements that can help out older graphics cards as readily as the very newest, while building on DLSS 3’s frame generation tool with Multi Frame Generation (MFG) to send visual smoothness skyrocketing. If you care even the slightest iota for how your PC performs in modern games, DLSS 4 demands your attention.
Here, then, I’ll break down DLSS 4’s various tricks and components, looking at how they really affect performance – and whether it’s worth upgrading your rig to maximise compatibility with it.

A California federal court denied a request for a preliminary injunction, ruling that Apple did not act unreasonably or in bad faith when it removed the app following complaints from music industry players and YouTube. The court found that Musi’s proposed injunction would not serve the public interest.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The creator of frying pan simulator Arctic Eggs is working on a fishing game that I am certain will replicate the act of angling in an entirely ordinary and accurate fashion. Its approach to hooks, lines, and sinkers will combine the fishing from Animal Crossing, Sega Bass Fishing, and Webfishing, says developer The Water Museum in a post on Bluesky. It may have a splash of Dredge when it comes to inventory management too. Oh, also, a strange man might imply you are "disappointing someone". Nothing to worry about. And the ocean may or may not turn completely red. These decisions have not been finalised. Everything is okay. It is possible the fish are safe to eat.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hidden away on NASA's Golden Record, an interstellar archive of music, image and sound, there is a recording of a poem by Charles Baudelaire, Élévation, which describes the astral ascent of the soul. Well, part of a poem. Both to free up room on the disc and perhaps, to edit out "the vast sorrows and all the vexations" of the second half, only the first two stanzas appear. The recording in fact ends halfway through a line, which conjures up an intriguing problem for the listener, inasmuch as the thwarted rhyme scheme reveals that the piece is incomplete. A poetically-minded alien might be tempted to fill in the gap. A fancier alien who took a module in postmodernism might hail the poetics of the fragment. A resolutely practical alien who thinks poetry is for losers might read the whole thing, instead, as a set of incoherent navigational prompts, made up of loose prepositions - au-dessus, au-dessus, par delà, par delà.

Yes, I'm well aware that "2.5D" and "Soulsvania" are nonsense words, woven by pestilent market forces. Samuel Johnson is turning in his grave, I expect. He has risen from his grave and equipped himself with an ironbound dictionary and is even now making his way through the layers of the English language, hellbent on slaughtering every 'vania yet coined.
But never mind Samuel. Oversized rodents and spiders aside, Mandragora is notable for being written by Brian Mitsoda, writer of the original Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines and the former narrative lead for its sequel at Hardsuit Labs, which lives on in the hands of The Chinese Room. Primal have just announced a release date - 17th April. Here's a trailer.

It's a crunchy, dicey machine of vibrant world-building that sometimes forgets itself in wandering prose. A compelling universe to sail through, with more habitats and hovels than its predecessor, more stations and stellar gateways. It can't - for me - escape the dense gravity of the first game's compact storytelling and novel character building, no matter how often it funnels you from one space caper to the next. But it has a good time trying.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bioware released a statement yesterday. It talked of "turning towards the future". It dreamed of "a more agile, focused studio". Nowhere in the post did the word "layoffs" appear. But this is what the post was actually about. The closest it got to addressing the facts of what happened to an unspecified number of workers is the phrase: "we don’t require support from the full studio." 
It's one of the most disingenuous announcements of job cuts in a recent and plentiful history of job cuts. A weirdly impressive feat from BioWare, considering the last two or three years have seen some spectacular verbal gymnastics from games companies when it comes to shitcanning people. Let's take a look at some of our "favourite" mealy-mouthed press releases in which people have their jobs poetically "sunsetted" rather than, say, dropkicked out the window.

A number of Dragon Age: The Veilguard staff are leaving the celebrated RPG company in the course of plans to become "a more agile, focused studio", as BioWare move ahead with the next Mass Effect game. Posting on Bluesky, senior systems designer Michelle Flamm, producer Jen Cheverie, editor Karin West-Weekes, lead writer Trick Weekes and narrative designer Ryan Cormier have all announced that they're looking for work.


All of which feels like it warrants a mention in general manager Gary McKay's recent blog about BioWare's future, but he comments only that they're "taking the opportunity to reimagine" how BioWare operate between projects, and "have worked diligently over the past few months to match many of our colleagues with other teams at EA that had open roles that were a strong fit." Which is a very slippery way to say that you're making a load of people redundant.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mere hours before it’s January 30th release – wait, that’s today! – Sony have finally spilled the beans on system requirements for Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, as well as the eye-blistering, GPU-rending special features that more powerful rigs can support. Happily, all these ray tracing and frame generation accoutrements seemingly won’t preclude Spidey 2 from working on older, slower PCs as well, as the minimum specs are surprisingly reasonable.
Granted, they’re only rated for 30fps at a lowly 720p, and you’ll still need to find a honking 140GB of SSD space, but the basic GPU and CPU requirements aren’t too lofty at all. The likes of an RTX 3060 for 60fps/1080p are quite reasonable as well, though you’re staring down the barrel of Nvidia’s pricey RTX 4080 and RTX 4090 cards for high-rez ray tracing.

"An account for PlayStation Network will become optional for these titles on PC," said PlayStation in a short and quiet blog post that includes the upcoming PC release for Spider-Man 2, and The Last Of Us Part II. It's been eight months since PlayStation provoked mass annoyance among PC players by making a PSN account mandatory to play Helldivers 2, and later Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered. They soon walked back the decision for Helldivers 2 after a rough review-bombing but the company didn't seem to fully take the hint. It looks like they've now conceded that, yes, the obligatory sign-up was an unpopular move.

You'll wish you'd been dusted by nuclear fire when you're being torn open by some kind of demon puppet in a labyrinth of red curtains.


If you do get torn open by a demon puppet, the good news is that players have a range of artificial bodies to choose from. Among Phantom Line's headline features is the HUSK system, which lets you switch between members of your squad right in the middle of combat. Unless, presumably, the body in question is already occupied by one of your co-op partners. If all this sounds appealing, the even-gooder news is that there's now a demo available via the developer Discord.

News comes via Nic himself that modder FrancisLouis, whose previous works include performance-enhancing rejigs of various games (and one that turns the Silent Hill 2 remake’s pipe weapon into a rigid, A-posing wife), has produced Fantasy Optimizer: an overhaul of how FF7 Rebirth handles shaders and streamed visuals. Both Nic and myself have tried it out on our respective rigs, and it works! Mostly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Has any genus of graphics card been as dramatically storied as the GeForce XX80s? The RTX 3080 was a thing of beauty, only to be tarnished by the worst wheeler-dealing spree (and crypto mining misappropriation) in PC component history. Then the RTX 4080 rocked up with its laughable £1269 / $1199 price tag, a miscalculation so severe that the RTX 4080 Super looked good – despite hardly being any faster – simply for not repeating it. For the new RTX 5080’s sake, you almost want it to be boring.
It isn’t. But then, neither is it a blood-boiler like the RTX 4080, nor a largely aspirational show-off piece like the RTX 5090. By maintaining the 4080 Super’s course correction on price while tooling up on compelling DLSS 4 improvements, the RTX 5080 is an agreeable GPU from the off. Particularly, if you’ve got the 4K monitor to take full advantage of it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I cherish my fairly sharp memories of the 2016 launch version of No Man's Sky, inasmuch as the contrast renders the latest additions to the wistful space game all the more dazzling. Dazzling and exhausting. What was once a relatively (and to some extent unintentionally) lean procgen exploration sim has swelled into a game of mechs, fishing, fickle weather systems, intricate asteroid engagements, starbases, nautiloids and capes. It is far bigger than it reasonably needs to be, and it's only getting more and more, er, infinite.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Friend, I regret to inform you that ant nests are computers now. Which is to say, somebody's finally made a video game version of Hex, the sentient glass hive from Terry Pratchett's Unseen University. In spooky automation-driven strategy sim Microtopia, you manage a swarm of what could either be ants who've been to the ripperdoc, or PC components who've grown legs and antennae. Your goal is to expand an insect colony that is also a motherboard, where glittering pheromone trails double as silicon circuits.
The developers Cordyceps Collective have just announced a release date - February 18th - and what's this, there's a demo as well? Catch the trailer below.

The only "twos" you shall be "merging" in Sniper At Work are bullets and faces. The only "cherries" you shall be "picking" are hoodlums in sore need of a skullful of lead. The only princes you shall acknowledge are their royal highnesses Distance, Wind, and Timing.
You may or may not find all that "soothing" - I won't judge. I will only repeat Nic's observation from the Maw that Sniper At Work look "a bit like Commandos, a bit like Hitman", which I would translate to "my comrade in PC gaming, if historic audience trends are any indication you shall do well here". Right, that's enough quotation marks for one article. There won't be any left for the next interview feature at this rate. Here's the trailer.

Allegations of destruction of evidence, obstructing service, and abuse of Nintendo's legal team, combine to make a dire situation even worse. But not for Nintendo.

Experts from the public and private sectors came together to discuss various topics, including the need to deploy balanced and effective site blocking measures in the United States.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In regular Darkest Dungeon 2, your mind, body and soul are fixed upon the points of a horrible mountain, looming over the inn at the end of every foetid wagon ride. It's sort of Journey for plague doctors, or possibly The Hobbit: Cosmodick Turpin Edition. I enjoy feeling the weight of those distant peaks upon my brain and eyeballs, but it's nice to fire up Kingdoms, the new free DD2 game mode that's launched just today, and have a choice of disasters to trundle toward.  


Over here is an inn being overrun by slathering beastmen. Over there is another, safer inn, but it's inconveniently perched behind a nest of tentacular cultists. In the middle there is you, with the customary DD party of half-dead, half-mad adventurers, equipped with an exciting smorgasbord of sharp edges, cursed artefacts, phobias and diseases. Let us proceed laughing and wailing to the launch trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Assassin's Creed publishers Ubisoft are making another round of layoffs as part of wider efforts to persuade their investors to stop yelling at them. They're letting 185 people go across their European operations, and will be closing UK-based Ubisoft Leamington, whose recent projects include supporting development of Star Wars Outlaws and Skull And Bones. All this less than two months after jettisoning the hundreds of people who worked on free-to-play shooter XDefiant.

Space Engineers 2 launches into the starry depths of early access today, although it is currently limited to a single player creative mode. It's the sequel to the sci-fi shipbuilding game we quite enjoyed here at RPS. At this early alpha stage, the not-yet-a-survival-game invites players to create galleons of the galaxy, block by shiny metal block, and then drive those ships into one another at 300 metres per second.

It's a fertilized duck egg, boiled or steamed, in which you can still see the duck embryo as you munch. I'm too old to discover this acquired taste on a gap year, but I'm not too old to waltz down the horror aisle in Itch.io, throwing retro jumpscarers into my basket. Which is where first-person Filipino suspense game Hapunan can be found. You play a young street food vendor hawking the eggs on a quiet corner late at night. Naturally, something alarming is afoot.

First, there was Dynasty Warriors: Origins, which I enjoyed quite a bit. Then Ninja Gaiden 2 Black got a surprise release. Now, we're getting Team Ninja's Rise Of The Ronin this coming March - the 11th to be precise. I'd do a bit about stealth drops but I'm at the point where using game-thematic verbs makes me want to collapse on a bed of caltrops, throat first. Here's a trailer:

It's a single-button affair, having you navigate levels by alternating a pivot-point on a shape I don't know the name of so I'm just going to call a spinny stick.
There are moving background elements in some stages - in others, you make your own pace. Except I can't really make my own pace, can I Bauhaus Bonk? Because the swing soundtrack makes me feel like a plodding buffoon if I'm not responding with appropriate gusto. This is entrapment, game. I am devilishly compelled by swing, like a Reefer Madness extra.

I know some of you are old enough to know what a letter opener is, or even to own one. Statistically, most of the RPS readership are Lich Lords. The Maw letter opener differs from regular letter openers in that when you open a letter with it, you will encounter not a letter but a perfect copy of yourself opening a letter in the opposite direction. The two of you must now fight to the death to decide who is the letter-opener and who is the letter. It's yours for a piffling three pints of any available body fluid, but if you don't want to buy a letter opener you can always buy one of this week's new PC games instead.

Doom: The Dark Ages launches on May 15 for PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PS5—unless you’re eyeing one of the pricier editions, which grant early access starting May 13. Naturally, our attention is on the PC edition and, of course, where to get it for the best price.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My favourite genre of YouTuber is: "person who hyperfixates on one mundane detail of a blockbuster video game and gets strangely poetic about it".  When you offer me a five-hour video essay about an obscure adventure game from 1998, I will hide in the closet. But if you idly wonder where the rivers in Skyrim go, I will follow along dutifully like a baby elephant. This is how I ended up spending much of my afternoon watching David Cage characters pissing. One video creator decided to painstakingly count every instance of playable pee time in cinematic adventure game Heavy Rain. This is vital work. This is important work.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A performance and settings guide for a ropey PC port of a Final Fantasy game? Sweet, I haven’t done one of these in four whole months. In fairness to Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, which Nic says can be great as a game per se, it does make some effort at settling into Windows. It has rebindable M+K controls. It has DLSS. It has generally more consistent framerates than FFXVI, which could bait you in with silky visuals before grabbing your head and shoving it into the cold ice bath of sub-30fps.
Yet it also steps back from that game on its supported tech, while raising its hardware requirements so far above Final Fantasy 7 Remake that it won’t even launch on a lot of older graphics cards. Even so, hitching and microstuttering issues from FF7 Remake return once more, along with plenty of other signs that this PC version didn’t get the love that a lot of other erstwhile PlayStation exclusives – like Horizon Forbidden West or God of War Ragnarök – did for their ports.

I don't make the rules, that's just how Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 explains the lack of elders in its very French yet very JRPG world. The fantasy game will see you journey across a dangerous landscape to stop the mad "paintress" who's magically culling humanity at younger and younger ages every year. We've been keeping a weary middle-aged eye on its development, and yesterday it got a release date. It's too late for most of us in the RPS treehouse. But watch the trailer for yourself, maybe you'll make it.

Maybe Hazel is just very small. Either way, it also dangles an important morsel in front of our snapping jaws: a release date. Come see.

So instead, I'm going to say that it has materialised from the darkness like a resurfacing duck, its beak stuffed with pond vegetation. The pond vegetation, here, stands for "tweaks to the weapons upgrade system". Here's a trailer.

Fortunately, we had a roundtable interview afterward with executive producer Marty Stratton and game director Hugo Martin. Sweet, job-justifying details!
Writing up the interview in full would involve typing out the words "awesome", "slaughter", "core pillars", and "iPod" more times than anyone realistically needs to read. Instead, here's a list of every detail I found interesting that isn't already covered in the showcase.

"The music, the amazing variety in terrain and units, the sheer quantity of words bringing to life every last quest, minor faction, creature, and environmental anomaly," breathed a reverential Ollie in 2023. "It's a simply splendid game." Like somebody commenting on the sturdiness of an original Picasso's frame, I will only add that it now runs pretty comfortably on the current least expensive Dell Thinkpad.
Why in Meier's name would Sega choose to sell off the studio behind such a worldly wonder? The answer is lost in time (it's through that link, there), but fortunately, Amplitude endure as an independent - and they've just announced Endless Legend 2 with no less than Hooded Horse as publisher. Here's the announcement trailer.

Between its multiple release date delays in response to Star Wars Outlaws not selling as well as Ubisoft would've liked, and Ubi potentially being bought by Tencent as they clamour for help, there's a sense that Shadows needs to deliver not only a great game, but corporate redemption.
I've now played Shadows for four hours, having dipped into a bit of prologue action, some open world exploration, and a questline as both the hulking Yasuke and the lithe Naoe. Have Ubi delivered? I think there's a strong chance. What I played was a lot of comforting Creeding, carried along by a gorgeous interpretation of Edo Japan, and some subtle tweaks to up stealth stakes. Although I do think the two protagonists are a split personality that doesn't quite work for me.

I am thrust headlong into each of these obstacles a dozen times before my withered synapses and tired bones internalise these arboreal teachings and I make it safely to the bottom.

As in life, there is joy to be found in this journey precisely because it is hard. Unlike in life, the camera is often facing backwards while you do it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dwarf Fortress's Adventure mode - a procedurally generated campaign that lets you approach the famously dense colony sim like a more traditional roguelite - is now out as a free update on Steam. The game represents perhaps the most cavernous, yawping blind spot in my entire pile of shame. I do own it, but I'm yet to play. I've already read a great deal of extended wordery on its merits - please, sell it to me in the comments in seven words or less. Here's a trailer:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Readers, I have spent two full days in the benchmark pits to tell you what you've already guessed: the GeForce RTX 5090 is very fast, too expensive, and laden with more AI tech than Philip K. Dick’s cheese dreams. At least two of those points will, I’m sure, send the average graphics card shopper running, especially at a time when even game developers are growing suspicious of generative AI and its many-thumbed, robot-voiced nostrums.
Yet while there’s not much to be done about the RTX 5090 costing at minimum £1939 / $1999, hundreds more than the infamously spenny RTX 4090, its suite of more purely performance-focused artificial intelligence tools is – dare I say it – quite neat. These range from Multi Frame Generation (MFG), which is basically DLSS 3 frame gen but up to twice as fast, to DLSS 4’s general upscaling enhancements and even the ability to apply newer DLSS versions to older games. All this will come to the rest of the RTX 50 series as well, with some trickling down to the enter RTX range, so maybe the RTX 5090 is best understood not as a practical GPU purchase in itself but as a Picadilly Square-filling advert for its more affordable siblings can do.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a dramatic turn of events, the Royal Shakespeare Company have finally acknowledged that video games are cool and theatre simply does not have enough buttons. They are partnering with a game studio to create a playable adaptation of Macbeth from the point of view of someone examining Lady Macbeth's computer for dirt. Lili looks a lot like the interactive drama popularised by Sam Barlow's Her Story and Telling Lies. Except this has the added twist of being set in contemporary Iran. The game "will see Macbeth’s witches reimagined as hackers, with surveillance cameras and cyber-infiltration putting the player at the heart of the story..." Witchy hackers? I'm in.

Nvidia reckon that won’t be an issue with for the imminent RTX 5090 and RTX 5080, though, even with the former’s drastically increased 575W power limit.

Now I think about, you could probably eat quite a lot of custard creams in five months, although less so if you were using your hands to build model robots. Have a trailer. It's got robots in it.

A city-building game that takes place on small, post-apocalyptic islands, where the only way to expand is upward.
"Playing Jenga with human lives" is how they summarise it, the wastrels. Here's a trailer.

The decision to call it quits follows a bust-up within the development team, though this isn't, apparently, why they pulled the plug. Thorson and programmer Noel Berry have found making something "bigger and better" than Celeste exhausting, and have decided to work on smaller projects in future.
