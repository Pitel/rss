If you've been having online difficulties with your Nintendo Switch earlier today, it's not just you. Nintendo's network services have been experiencing some problems - supposedly preventing users from not only accessing the Switch eShop but also launching applications and digital games from the home menu.
Nintendo appears to have resolved this problem after a number of hours - issuing the following notices over time on its customer support Twitter account:

One of the highlights of the week was the announcement of the Mega Drive Mini 2 - Sega's next miniature console, loaded with 50 games from the Mega Drive and Mega CD libraries. It's launching this October in Japan and will include games like Sonic CD, Slipstream and Virtua Racing.
As exciting as this news is, it hasn't stopped fan requests for miniature versions of Sega's other consoles - like the Saturn and Dreamcast. So, why did Sega decide to release a Mega Drive 2 instead of something else? During an interview with Famitsu, Sega's classic hardware producer Yosuke Okunari explained how the pandemic shaped the outcome.

This week's retro release from Hamster takes us back to the birth of a Namco legend — now available to download on PS4 and Nintendo Switch from the Arcade Archives, it's the legendary Tower of Druaga.
Released to Japanese arcades in 1984, before later finding its way to early home computers and consoles, The Tower of Druaga is a simple maze game with surprisingly deep lore. The game follows the adventures of the brave knight Gilgamesh, who must ascend the 60-story tower to rescue the beautiful maiden Ki from a terrifying, multi-limbed demon — the titular "Druaga."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCCGIP4SifE
A proto-procedurally generated title, Tower of Druaga randomizes its 60 floors on every playthrough, with players fighting off ghosts, slimes, and other nasties while gathering a sackful of special items in order to progress further and further up the increasingly challenging locale. As simplistic as the title looks in the video above, (courtesy of YouTuber Old Classic Retro Gaming), this Namco classic had a complex development, with director Masanobu Endo determined to make a deep and engaging RPG experience.
The Tower of Druaga is today considered the first entry in the "Babylonian Castle Saga," a series that has gone on to include a slew of releases including The Return of Ishtar (1986), The Destiny of Gilgamesh (1994), and Arika's 2004 release The Nightmare of Druaga. Additionally, a spin-off anime series, The Tower of Druaga: The Aegis of Uruk, was produced and released by studio Gonzo in 2008. Not a bad legacy for one of both Namco and the arcade scene's formative adventures.

The Sony State of Play on Wednesday had to be one of the best we've seen in a long time, because that half-hour was chalked full of some really great titles we'll be looking forward to in the coming months. From the gorgeous Resident Evil 4 remake they announced, to the immersive VR adventures, to genre-bending titles like Rollerdome and Eternights, it's easy to see why PlayStation is killing it right now, despite the chip shortage situation. Of all the announcements, though, there are two non-violent games that really stuck out to me this time around: Season and Stray.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Insight from Pokémon World Champions and Temtem’s Director.
In 1998 my Canadian elementary school banned everything to do with Pokémon. The games, the trading cards, and discussions about the anime – all of it was off-limits as Pocket Monster fever swept through North America like a swarm of Rattata, distracting us from our in-class reading of Anne of Green Gables. That did not stop me and my classmates from passing notes about whether or not there really was a Mew beneath the truck parked near the S.S. Anne when Mrs. Hubbard turned her back. Nor did it stop us from pitying those poor souls whose parents would not buy them a Game Boy, let alone a copy of Pokémon Red or Blue. To us, that was a step removed from child abuse.
Many people can relate similar anecdotes about playing the quintessentially classic Red and Blue. By ‘quintessential’ I mean Pokémon games stand out as some of the most memorable and influential gaming experiences ever made. Yet the special thing about Pokémon is this phenomenon which isn’t exclusive to those of us in Canada or born around 1990. Up until this year’s Pokémon Legends: Arceus, every mainline Pokémon game is a classic for another generation of kids the world over. Somehow, Pokémon developer Game Freak continues to capture cultural touchstone after cultural touchstone as if it were as easy as catching a Caterpie.

Outfit unlocks (which eventually become free or paid DLC for the most part) rule. Every so often I'll talk about the feeling of playing through say, an action game, and picking up drastically different outfits for party members: and it's sort of indescribably fun to me. That includes this FFVII Remake Sailor Moon mod from juijub.
Thankfully, PC modding has made the practice of outfit unlocks easier than ever. As in, you literally download a file for the FFVII Remake Sailor Moon mod, and boom! You get the fan-made equivalent of a $10 DLC during the Xbox 360 era. Wild, right? This mod takes the base concept of Sailor Mars, Sailor Moon, and Tuxedo Mask, and applies them to Tifa, Aerith, and Cloud respectively. It's quite the power trio, but the combo fits Aerith perfectly, from her move set even down to her hairstyle.

So as usual, you can pick up the invisible weapon mod for Tifa from creator Narknon, which helps all Tifa costume mods sing. This hair color mod (also by juijub) lets you mix and match to fit the Sailor Moon costumes.
After this, be sure you check out the recent Final Fantasy X outfit mod!

Those Pokémon are: Tropius, Torkoal, and Galarian Mr. Mime. We'll need to use incense to lure all of them out when they appear in their habitats.
As the Fest unfolds, each hour brings a different habitat with different Pokémon to catch. Many can be the rare shiny variant. Here's what you will find in each, along with the shiny opportunities:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let's rock, baby! Season 6 of Video Gameography gets stylish as we examine the Devil May Cry series! Over the next few weeks, we’ll be covering the history and lore of Capcom’s premiere action franchise. This week we start from the beginning as we unpack one of the most influential action games ever, Devil May Cry.
Arriving stateside on October 16, 2001, the game stars Dante, a demon hunter (and half-demon himself) on a mission to stop underworld emperor Mundus from invading the human world. The game began life as Resident Evil 4, helmed by a hotshot young director named Hideki Kamiya who veered the game from survival horror to stylish action. While it proved too drastic of a departure for Resident Evil, Capcom knew they had something and reworked the project into its own franchise. Listen on to learn how Dante was conceived, our thoughts on the game’s story, and how we fared against the game’s legendarily brutal difficulty.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cool robots and nostalgia can only do so much, though.
Biomotor Unitron has a wicked name. We’d forgive you for assuming it refers to an obscure power metal band or maybe the title of a 1990s mech-based anime. In reality, Biomotor Unitron is a mech-building role-playing game originally released for the Neo Geo Pocket Color way back in 1999 – which is also pretty cool. But does this retro title, now available on Nintendo Switch eShop, live up to the evocative image its name invokes?
In Biomotor Unitron, you assume the role of a Unitron Master. In other words, a pilot of a meteor-powered mech suit called a Unitron. Unitron Masters the world over gather in the city of Rhafiace to compete in arena battles in order to eventually earn the rank of Master of Masters (yes, you read that right). A handful of characters add a little colour to the adventure and there’s a Big Bad to defeat, but by no means is this narrative one to remember.

This is somehow the third time this has happened on the War Thunder forums. The first happened in July 2021, as a War Thunder player posted classified documents in an effort to prove a point about one of the in-game tanks.
Later that year, the same thing happened again. A player got into an argument about a French battle tank, and to win the sparring match, they posted a part of the tank manual.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The PS5 hits an important milestone
Even with how difficult it is to get a PS5 these days, Sony is still doing well for itself, because the PS5 just surpassed 20 million units sold. Veronica Rogers, SVP, Head of Global Sales and Business Operations at Sony Interactive Entertainment, broke the news to GamesIndustry.biz, and expressed how "thrilled" the company was to have reached this milestone for its newest console. Part of me has to wonder how many of those are currently stacked up in scalpers' houses, but it's still an impressive feat nonetheless.
Sony has struggled to keep up with demand for the PS5 since its launch in November of 2020 due to the ongoing chip shortage, but even so, it managed to reach 20 million units sold after one year, six months, and twenty-two days, only about three months later than the PS4 did. According to a tweet from games analyst Daniel Ahmad, the PS5 actually hit 10 million units faster than its predecessor, and "the issues with supply is why it's behind now."
https://twitter.com/ZhugeEX/status/1532744064516382722
Rogers continued on in her statement to GamesIndustry.biz to speak directly to players who are still waiting for their chance to purchase a console: "To those fans who have yet to get their hands on a console, please know that we are planning on a significant ramp-up in PS5 production this year and we are working endlessly to make sure that PlayStation 5 is available for everyone who wants one."
It doesn't seem like the chip shortage is letting up any time soon, but it's nice to hear that Sony has a plan to make the PS5 more accessible to those who might want one. That's a nice sentiment, but I think this is just one of those situations that I'm going to have to see to believe. Here's hoping some more consoles are coming soon, because I certainly don't want to miss out on any of the exciting new titles PlayStation has on the way.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Amazon Games has partnered with Disruptive Games, the studio behind Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 and Diablo II: Resurrected, to create a new intellectual property that will release on a variety of machines. Described by Amazon Games as an online multiplayer action-adventure with cooperative and competitive play, this new experience appears to be set in a post-apocalytpic or post-war world. This observation comes from two pieces of concept art that show crashed airplanes that appear to be heavily weathered.
The humans pictured in these artworks hold primitive weapons, such as a rifle with a bayonet. One of the characters appears to have mechanical legs. Several of these beings also wear headsets with tall antenna, likely for cooperative communication.
In a press release, Christoph Hartmann, the vice president of Amazon Games, says we can expect something different from this multiplayer experience. "The talented team at Disruptive Games is creating a fresh take on the multiplayer action-adventure genre, with strong game design and rich world-building that we're excited to help bring to players." 
On Disruptive's official website, this new IP is amusingly codenamed "super secret project." We'll have to wait for more details, but the usage of concept art with game title implies it's a long way off.]]></summary>

I scoured the internet for dinosaur titles that are in the works and found five that look promising. The last one on this list is something you can download right now. Here's what we can look forward to soon:


Jurassic Architect
. Jurassic Architect is currently in development for PC and looks incredibly ambitious, almost like a sci-fi and prehistoric Sim City. Sadly, no release date has been given.


Deathground


The Lost Wild


Paleo Pines


Dinosaur Fossil Hunter
If you are looking for something you can play on PC right now, Dinosaur Fossil Hunter was released last month, and offers a deep simulation where you are tasked to drive across open worlds to find fossil sites, and then use various gadgets to locate and dig for dinosaur bones. The collections you unearth can then be displayed in your own museum. You get to design all of the displays and arrange how the dinosaurs look.]]></summary>

Reports went around this morning that GameStop was no longer expecting the Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time remake to release. Turns out, that's not quite the case. The Prince of Persia remake is happening, though it's just as delayed as it already was.
Word of GameStop letting pre-order holders know the game wasn't expected to release was running around. The pre-order was delisted from GameStop's website. Popular games and deals Twitter account Wario64 noted the situation this morning:

With a month of reveals lined up, more footage of Sonic Frontiers surfaced today on IGN, and this time, combat is the focus with six minutes of drawn-out robot encounters.
If you haven't seen it yet, it's worth watching yesterday's open-world exploration and puzzle gameplay first — you kind of need to see both sides of the coin. Even then...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q88r4mKJGoM
I'll just come right out with it: the entire vibe seems extremely weird with this open-world game, to the point where I'm struggling to picture how all of these pieces will fit together to form a satisfying, lively experience. Maybe they will, maybe they won't. But this continues to be a poor first impression for what could conceptually be a smash-hit game.

Listen, maybe I'm late to the party and everyone else knows this, but did you know there's a very likely explanation for all of Breath of the Wild's weird shrine names?
This whole time, I've been thinking that there must be some explanation for the really weird shrine names, like Bareeda Naag and Daka Tuss Shrine, which both sound like a Sim ordering a curry. Eventually, though, I gave up on trying to figure it out — only to have the answer dropped on me like a bombshell, five years after finishing the game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Big things are once again happening in Fortnite. On June 4, players are invited to experience a timed event called "Collision." This story-driven moment can only be played once and will kick off at 4 p.m. ET. Epic Games says the fate of the Zero point will be decided in this gameplay event, which I believe will lead into Chapter 3, Season 3.
The events in Fortnite are always fun, as they shake up the gameplay, change the environments, and introduce new characters to the battle royale universe. Collision hits just a week after Obi-Wan Kenobi is introduced. A mysterious tower has also appeared in the center of the island.
Epic Games is encouraging streamers and players to record the event, as it won't be repeated. The last event brought us The Foundation (played by Dwayne Johnson) and Spider-Man. The island also flipped over and gave us an entirely new map to discover. What will happen this time? The teaser image above gives us a taste of a monstrous return.
If you have the Battle Pass, you have just one week to complete it and get Doctor Strange (and his alternate costumes in the bonus tier). Fly through the missions you can for big XP bumps.
If you log in at any point on June 4 after 8 a.m. ET, you'll receive an exclusive loading screen and lobby track for Collision. You'll be able to log into the Collision lobby 30 minutes before the event begins.
What do you hope to see from Season 3? Any character skins you are hoping to see added or return?]]></summary>

For whatever reasons, Snow Bros. rented space in my brain as a youth. I think a cabinet was only briefly available in my hometown’s hockey arena, but a brief sight of it was enough to get me itching for more time with it. Why were the longest-running cabinets in that arena Altered Beast and Pang? I wanted to find a home version of it, but the only one I would have had access to was for the NES, and my family traded ours away when I was very young.
That doesn’t mean much, though. Like many kids, I was stupid. However, it still resulted in a lasting soft spot for Snow Bros. Not enough to play the mobile titles that have come along since, but enough that when Snow Bros. Nick & Tom Special was announced, it caught my attention.

It's a Mario Strikers weekend! The demo is live starting tonight, and will run through Sunday in brief windows of time.
The first session is due to start tonight at 8PM PT, and it'll run for one hour. After that you can try for the next session on Saturday morning at 4AM PT, followed by events at 12PM and 8PM. Then on Sunday, there's two sessions: 4AM and 12PM. It's a little confusing, but just remember that you can only play for one hour in total when each session starts, and you should be good.
You can pre-load/grab the "First Kick" demo here. It does require Switch Online, but there is a Switch Online free trial offer through My Nintendo. Training sessions are also part of the demo, on top of "Versus Everyone" and "Join Friends" modes. Consider this a last-minute PSA, so you have ample time to download the demo now or queue it up before you get back from work, to join in tonight!
As a reminder, here are the Mario Strikers weekend times:
Friday, June 3 – 8:00-9:00pm PT
Saturday, June 4 – 4:00-5:00am PT
Saturday, June 4 – 12:00-1:00pm PT
Saturday, June 4 – 8:00-9:00pm PT
Sunday, June 5 – 4:00-5:00am PT
Sunday, June 5 – 12:00-1:00pm PT

It feels like a matter of time before Sony and Housemarque bring Returnal over to PC, and today, we're one step closer to that port becoming a reality. As spotted by @Nibellion, a listing on SteamDB contains references to the adrenaline-pumping PS5 exclusive.
While the SteamDB page uses the codename "Oregon," it includes specific words and phrases related to Returnal including "Atropos" (the alien planet), "Helios" (Selene's ship), and the "Tower of Sisyphus" (an endless mode recently added to Returnal on PS5).
Additionally, this presumed Returnal PC build has on-brand Steam tags like "Third-Person Shooter," "Bullet Hell," "Sci-fi," "Rogue-lite," and "Female Protagonist."

Oh hey, Wolfenstein: The New Order is free. It's up for grabs on the Epic Games Store this week, and you've got until Thursday, June 9 to claim this (worth playing!) PC game.
It's something that many of us have already played by now thanks to years and years of deals, but I'm sure some of you reading this haven't tried it yet, and I'd nudge you in that direction. I'm trying to put myself back in that 2014 headspace right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwjKMjIE1rs
I remember being surprised by how much I enjoyed the story — though, at the time, I was admittedly coming in for the FPS action, not necessarily the narrative. You can't help but root for B.J. Blazkowicz every step of the way, and Wolfenstein: The New Order feels really personal. You're out to brutalize every Nazi you see, naturally, but there are hard-hitting themes and genuine character moments in the mix, too. MachineGames swung for the fences, and it paid off; The New Order showed up in Game of the Year discussions.
With that said, even if you lack a soft spot for the Wolfenstein series (or have no personal history with it whatsoever), you can absolutely have a good time with this game.
Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus was an increasingly out-there sequel, and not all of its zanier moments landed, but I still mostly dug the game and would be super on board for a (hopefully more well-rounded) Wolfenstein III. Yes, Indiana Jones is cool too. But come on!
Next week's free game is a mystery
Fans will be playing the waiting game for a while, it seems. At least next week, the Epic Games Store will be back with another free mystery game on Thursday, June 9.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Resident Evil fans have had a lot to celebrate over the years. Biohazard and Village have brought the series back to its horror roots in unique ways. The Resident Evil 2 and 3 Remakes have been a perfect way to relive the glories of the past with contemporary improvements. But what comes next? Resident Evil 4 Remake is the answer, and we're pouring over every detail of the new trailer in today's spoiler-filled breakdown.


Alex Stadnik is your host for the video and welcomes Resident Evil 4 superfan Blake Hester to dissect every nook and cranny of Capcom's surprise announcement from the latest Sony State of Play. As stated above, we go into a lot of spoilers of the original game, so if you haven't played it yet, please bookmark this video and come back.
The boys kick things off by discussing their levels of surprise when the fourth entry in the iconic series makes its first appearance. They then break the trailer down scene by scene, letting you know what they think will be different and what will stay the same. They also ponder if the remake will feature a character similar to Mr. X, Nemesis, or Lady D instead of creating a straight one-to-one recreation. Finally, they wrap by discussing whether or not the game will get delayed and what their levels of hype are after seeing Leon's return.
Are you excited about Resident Evil 4? The wait isn't too long as Capcom's next remake is launching on March 24, 2023, for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sega revealed a quick 30-second teaser of Sonic Frontiers gameplay earlier this week, and IGN released a full seven-minute look at the open-world gameplay of the Blue Blur’s latest. Now, you can watch more than six minutes of combat from the game, and it looks like Sonic combat…in a 3D open world. 
As we previously saw, Sonic Frontiers’ world is beautiful and one of the most realistic-looking games in the franchise’s history. Today’s combat showcase takes place in the same area as the previous gameplay premiere but with decidedly less rail grinding and more spinball fighting action. As you might expect, Sonic fights in Sonic Frontiers like he always has – lots of jump attacks, spin moves, kicks, and more. However, it seems he does have a few new tricks up his sleeve. Namely, an in-air jolt attack that makes him dash all over the screen before doing an interesting rotating circle attack. Take a look for yourself below: 


As you can see, Sonic is up against some new types of enemies in Sonic Frontiers, and they seem to tank a lot more damage than the Blue Blur is traditionally used to doling out. That doesn’t appear to be a problem for him, though, as he aptly takes them out with ease. We also get a look at Sonic confronting a massive creature-like machine that stands extremely tall toward the end of the video. Sonic uses some interesting moves to eventually defeat that, too. 
Unfortunately, we don’t yet have a release date for Sonic Frontiers, but it’s coming sometime this year, so hopefully, we don’t have to wait too much longer. In the meantime, check out this trailer from last December, and then check out this other snippet of Sonic Frontiers gameplay that debuted earlier this week. 
What do you think of the combat in Sonic Frontiers? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

Thanks to new footage from a Famitsu stream (collated by the Tails' Channel Twitter) we now have insight into the Sonic Origins Mirror Mode. It'll take some getting used to!
With Sonic Origins quickly approaching on June 23, it's about time we got some cold hard gameplay. The stream clocks in at roughly an hour long, providing a new look at multiple facets of Origins: especially the "compilation" bits so to speak. One big thing that was shown off is some footage of Mirror Mode for Sonic 3 & Knuckles, which looks super nerve-wracking.
While mirror modes have been staples of games for a long time, and have been modded into various PC projects and ROMs for decades, it's still going to be crazy wrapping my mind around this.
https://twitter.com/TailsChannel/status/1532690562079416320
Beyond the Sonic Origins Mirror Mode reveal, the stream can be found below, alongside of some screens we've collected from various menus. We got a deep dive into the game's museum function, as well as the general UI of the game, which lets you swap between each title, on top of a museum and mission mode. Sonic 2 will also have a character select menu.

Unless you've been living under a rock recently, you may have seen the latest trailer for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. As expected, it gave us a pretty in-depth look at the new entries to the core series, unveiling some new Pokémon, the game's professors and rival characters, the two new legendaries, and the box art. In addition, we learned a bit more about what the games themselves will entail, including a full open world to be explored at will, along with 4-player cooperative multiplayer.
Given that the game seems to be a pretty significant step up in quality — at least in terms of exploration and connectivity — we wanted to know whether the latest trailer has done enough to convince you to jump back into the Pokémon universe.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Update, 6/3/22:
During yesterday’s State of Play showcase, Sony revealed Insomniac Games’ Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered would be coming to PC on August 12. It turns out Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales is actually coming to PC this year, too, according to a PlayStation Blog Post spotted by IGN. However, while Spider-Man Remastered will be released on PC this summer, the PlayStation blog says Miles Morales will “launch on PC in fall 2022,” so presumably later than August 12. 
Oddly enough, PlayStation didn’t reveal Miles Morales was coming to PC during yesterday’s showcase, an odd exclusion for a segment of the show that was all about Spider-Man’s big PC release. Nonetheless, you can play through both of Insomniac’s Spider-Man games on PC later this year.  
The original story continues below...
Original story, 6/2/22:
Have you been wanting to web-sling as Spidey on your PC? You’re in luck! Today, at Sony’s State of Play, it was announced that Insomniac’s Spider-Man is coming to PC in its remastered form on August 12. Previously, you could only play the game on PS4 and PS5. 
The remastered edition includes new assets, tech, and plenty of updates. In this edition, Peter Parker was recast to Ben Jordan to better match actor Yuri Lowenthal’s facial capture for PS5.
That’s right in just a few months, you’ll be able to experience the game that our own Andrew Reiner gave a 9.5, saying: “Like Batman: Arkham Asylum before it, Spider-Man raises the bar for one of the world’s most beloved heroes.” You can read his full review here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["Fallout 1st Members will be able to rank up even more quickly and claim bonus rewards, as a result of new enhancements we are making to the Scoreboard"
Fallout 76's new season is coming on June 14 with the Test Your Metal update, and it'll add a few wrinkles into the mix too.
Falling in with previous seasons, Season 9 will be centered around the theme of "Dread Island," which is a clear nod to Skull Island and the King Kong franchise. To be clear this isn't a place you can go directly in the game: it's an elaborate theming of a season pass track, which provides rewards for players. That said, it does provide a series of radio plays for everyone to enjoy. The first part can be found below!
Here's the setup for the Dread Island storyline:
"The Franklin family was riding high after embarking on an ambitious flight around the world. That is, until a turbulent storm led to a crash landing over uncharted territory, referred to by locals only as 'Dread Island.' The island’s ever-shifting environment is brimming with hidden treasures, ancient civilizations, and natural wonders waiting to be discovered, but it hides many dangers, as well. Cutthroat bandits, ferocious beasts, and the fury nature itself threaten even the sturdiest of adventurers who happen to wash up on Dread Island’s shores."

Continuing to do seasons this way is genius. When I'm not playing Fallout 76, it's fun to look in and at least acknowledge the effort the team is putting into something that is ostensibly a dressed-up battle pass. As far as what's new, there will be quicker rank-ups for Fallout 1st members, as well as bonus rewards/challenges.

Shiny Shoe, the team behind the deckbuilding hell-train roguelike Monster Train, has a new game in the works. Today the team revealed Inkbound, a co-op tactical roguelike that's coming to Steam Early Access in 2023.
While 2020's Monster Train blended deckbuilding with tower defense, Inkbound is going for a different vibe. According to the developer, it's blending tactics games, ARPGs, and roguelikes into one with hybrid real-time/turn-based battles.
The option is there to go fast or slow down, charging in for melee hits or staying just out of reach and pelting away with ranged attacks. Most notably, co-op play is a big component.

As I played Belle Boomerang, my husband looked over my shoulder and asked if it was difficult. “Yes,” I replied, “but I have it set to retro difficulty.” He asked if I was going to review it, which I confirmed. “Why would you make it harder on yourself?” he asked.
There are a few reasons. The first is that I like the challenge. I also feel the need to play on the difficulty the developer “intended,” which is something that might not always exist. Finally, I have a chip on my shoulder. I’ve been strengthened in the crucible of retro games. I’ve climbed Castlevania and conquered Contra. Should be a cakewalk.
It wasn’t, but then, that’s what I enjoyed most about Belle Boomerang.

We've got some more Sonic Frontiers footage today as part of IGN's month-long series. After Wednesday's divisive exploration gameplay, maybe some combat will help pick up the pace for the blue blur's upcoming open-world game?
This time we get to see Sonic go up against enemies we've not seen the likes of before. This is also the first time we've seen the blue blur trade some blows in Frontiers' new world. From the 6 minutes of footage, it looks like Sonic can home in on enemies, punch, kick, and circle them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The bundle is up now, but it unlocks on June 8
So uh, don't buy the KOTOR Switch bundle until after June 8, when the second game is out. Weird, right? Bundles and the eShop: sometimes a bad combination!
As we've established, Knights of the Old Republic II is out on June 8. KOTOR 1 came out on Switch on November 11, 2021. If you individually buy the latter outside of the bundle, you can play it right now, no issues. But if you buy the bundle, KOTOR 1 will be locked to the SKU of the second game, and won't work until June 8. Lame, right? Especially when you consider that the bundle saves you zero dollars (each game is $15, and the bundle is $30).
The flaw was pointed out by Redditor hyp3rstrike, who purchased the bundle, and found out that the first game wouldn't boot, getting the "you cannot play this software or downloadable content yet" message. According to another poster in the same thread, they were able to get a "one-time refund" for the KOTOR Switch bundle, but were allegedly told to read the fine print on how bundles work.
Now, this has happened before with bundles, and isn't a completely unique situation. But it's worth a PSA, and the practice is still stupid, even in 2022! Bundles that involve SKUs of games that are currently out, especially when said collection has you download each game separately (which the KOTOR Switch bundle does), should just work. Unless something is changed, consider this a warning for the KOTOR Switch bundle and others like it on the eShop.
Given the popularity of the Star Wars franchise, a lot of folks have called into Nintendo customer support about this: so fingers crossed it gets pushed up the chain and gets fixed eventually. On the other side of the equation, the fact that the bundle serves no purpose, with no monetary savings, also stings.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Xalavier Nelson Jr has a bit of a love hate relationship with screens right now. As development on his studio’s gutsy market game Space Warlord Organ Trading Simulator was wrapping up at the end of last year, he tells me he remembers “just being really angry at the concept of the borders of the screen”. He was, by his own admission, in “a vague fugue state” at the time, having spent months immersed in Space Warlord’s black and green trading interfaces. But the feeling of having his game “chained to these walls” at the edge of his monitor proved to be a surprisingly powerful one - so much so that it spurred Nelson Jr and his team at Strange Scaffold to create an entirely new kind of game in the months leading up to Warlord’s release: Witch Strandings.

That's right. Taking cues from Hideo Kojima’s hiking postal sim Death Stranding, Witch Strandings is a game that not only asks what Sam Bridges’ cross-country cargo routes might look like if they were made with a fraction of Kojima’s development budget, but also how games can create experiences that are “larger than my screen,” says Nelson Jr. And the answer, it turns out, lies in your PC’s humble mouse.

Fun news for adventure-loving PlayStation fans this morning, as indie outfit Finji has announced that its celebrated adventure title Tunic will bring its adorable brand of exploration and mystery to both PS4 and PS5 this September.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKlcpXPvB2o
Released on PC and Xbox platforms back in March of this year, Tunic is the tale... tail of an intrepid young fox who goes on a dangerous quest to free the soul of a once-legendary hero known only as The Heir. Our nameless hero explores the dense forests, ancient ruins, and dark, dingy caverns of a strange, fantasy kingdom, gathering the all-important pages of an ancient document that is said to contain the power to free The Heir from their prism prison. Battle monsters, solve puzzles, and uncover myriad secret pathways en route to glory.
Tunic received almost universal praise from critics and the video game community, praising its stylish but cute visuals, challenging combat, and its seemingly endless array of secrets and mysteries to be unfurled. With great boss battles, a fantastic and immersive soundtrack, and a compelling story of bravery, courage, and determination, Tunic won over almost all players and critics who encountered it, and is now getting set to spread its fine spirit among a whole new audience of players on PlayStation.
Tunic launches September 27 on PlayStation platforms. It is available to purchase right now on PC and Xbox. For further reading, you can check out our own Zoey Handley's thoughts on the pint-sized adventure right here.

Delphox, the final evolution of the Fire starter Fennekin from Pokemon X & Y, will be joining the roster on 9th June (or 8th June if you're in North America). Fans have suspected that Delphox would be the next addition to the game after dataminers uncovered its data alongside Espeon. This Fox Pokémon is known for its mix of Fire and Psychic-type moves, and was a pretty controversial evolution back when Generation 6 first launched.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Keep an eye out
Switch Online N64 controllers are selling like hotcakes. While the jury is out on the Expansion Pack concept as a whole, the controllers seem to be doing fairly well for Nintendo. When they're in stock, that is.
Remember how Nintendo said restocks would start up in 2022? So this is the page for the Nintendo 64 controllers for Nintendo Switch. Currently, it's out of stock. I know! In some ways this is a "too late" moment, but very few people actually were able to provide the proper heads-up, because they sold out in minutes (some estimates are at roughly nine minutes or less).
This is more of a PSA that Nintendo is seemingly continuing to restock the Switch Online N64 controllers, and to be vigilant if you're still gunning for them. Remember: these are only available for Switch Online members, which helps theoretically cut down on bots and scalping: except...not really, if they're going out of stock instantly anyway. The going rate on eBay right now (confirmed sold) is roughly anywhere from $80 to $125, which is a bit richer than the $49.99 MSRP. For reference, the Sega Genesis control pads are also sold out.
Oh, and another tip! Once it comes back in, note this trick that Wario64 and others have been circulating: add a stylus to push the order over the edge for free shipping.

In a short video posted on YouTube, the (surprisingly slick) production is little more than an amusing skit to let viewers know of their upcoming show, with a heavy emphasis on marketing-fuelled countdown timers. In a neat little surprise, however, the video ends with Suda51 himself making a brief appearance, exclaiming "what's up, nerds!". It's unclear if Suda51 will actually feature on June 9th in any capacity, but our presumption is that his appearance is strictly limited to this video.

A new blog has provided some insight into the recent Destiny 2 update that involves the solar reworks, and how they're intending to improve upon the foundation they built.
In short, the solar rework is not going as explosively as Bungie intended, by their own admission.

Plucky underdog fighter DNF Duel may only be a couple of weeks away from launch, but that fact, apparently, will not prevent it from revealing even more roster members. Check out this new trailer from publisher Nexon, which gives us our first in-action look at what may prove to be DNF Duel's final launch roster fighter: Launcher.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTbz8Ouj6z0&amp;t
In a somewhat terrifying 30 seconds, our tech-savvy, firepower-obsessed gal lets rip on her opposition with a ridiculous variety of firearms — all of which seem practically conjured out of thin air. From rocket launchers to miniguns, laser rifles to Bayonetta-style twin guns, Launcher not only comes loaded for bear, but is seemingly fully equipped for every single eventuality. The new girl closes out the round by calling a devastating cyber-cannon onto the playfield, voguing like a true diva as her opponent enters the stratosphere.
Many anime fighters as of late have introduced at least one firearms-based character, and usually with extremely effective results, (I'm looking at you, Happy Chaos). Whether Launcher proves to be just as frustrating to deal with as her bang-bang brethren remains to be seen, but her debut trailer certainly makes an impact. I'm not ready to face a bevy of these ladies in an online capacity. That's for sure.
Rollback don't fail me now.
DNF Duel launches June 28 on PlayStation and PC platforms. While you wait for its impending arrival, you have enough time to check out the character trailers for Berserker, Grappler, Hitman, Inquisitor, Striker, Ranger, Dragon Knight, Vanguard, Kunoichi, Crusader, and Ghostblade.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Die another day.
These days, it feels like you can hardly go a week without seeing another handful of games that are inspired by any combination of Metroidvanias, Soulslikes, or roguelikes. Souldiers—the first release from a new development studio called Retro Forge—is an interesting blend of those first two genres, pulling some of the best elements from both to make for a potent and memorable experience. Though Souldiers doesn’t quite manage to stick the landing perfectly, it does enough right that it certainly warrants a fair look.
Souldiers initially takes place in the kingdom of Zarga, which is at war with the neighboring country of Dadelm. Following the advice of the court magician, General Brigard leads his regiment through a cave to set up a counterattack, only for an earthquake to strike and trap all of them inside. Some time later, a mysterious Valkyrie appears and tells the warriors that they all unfortunately died, but they can come along with her if they’d like another shot at life. Left with little choice, Brigard chooses to go with the Valkyrie and is joined by some of his men, who soon find themselves in the land of Terragaya—a dangerous realm between life and death. Here, Brigard and his men hope to get to the bottom of what led to their demise, and perhaps even find some way to come back to life to save their kingdom.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sega has revealed its next miniature console, the Mega Drive Mini 2. 
This news comes by way of Video Games Chronicle, which reports that it will include 50 games from both the Mega Drive and Mega Drive CD, including ports of arcade games and games Sega calls “mysterious new work.” Sega revealed this mini console during a special livestream in Japan today. It included news that the company will release the Mega Drive Mini 2 on Oct. 27 (in Japan) with a roughly $75 price tag. Sega has not confirmed a release outside of Japan, according to VGC. 

VGC reports that these are the confirmed games so far:
Bonanza Bros (Mega Drive)
Fantasy Zone (because Fantasy Zone never hit the Mega Drive, this version is a port based on Super Fantasy Zone)
Magical Taruruto (Mega Drive)
Shining in the Darkness (Mega Drive)
Thunder Force IV (Mega Drive)
Virtua Racing (Mega Drive)
Mansion of Hidden Souls (Mega CD)
Popful Mail (Mega CD)
Shining Force CD (Mega CD)
Silpheed (Mega CD)
Sonic CD (Mega CD)
The Mega Drive Mini 2 follows 2019’s Mega Drive Mini, first announced in 2018. You can read our thoughts on it in the Game Informer Sega Mega Drive Mini review.

If you've managed to watch Stranger Things 4 by now, you might have caught the rather bizarre mention of the 'Americantendo', a hypothetical 16-bit console that's mentioned by the character Argyle. Don't worry if you haven't seen it yet, that's all the context we'll be providing here for fear of spoilers!
Well, Hyperkin has gone the extra mile and created a mock-up of what the 'Americantendo' might actually look it if it were real. The console and controller both sport colours from the flag of the United States, with the word 'Americantendo' showcased prominently just below the console's cartridge slot.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Due on March 31, and naturally 'at a later date on Switch'
After a tease late last year, people cracked the code, and recognized a subtle flute melody from the Ubisoft game Child of Light. And lo and behold, confirmed this morning by 505 Games, there's going to be a Bloodstained Child of Light crossover.
Aurora, the hero from 2014's Child of Light, is entering the fray. She has a light story reason for being there, having "awoken in a strange, dangerous new land." She'll wield the Sword of Matildis from her game, and will be accompanied by the cute floating blob wisp Igniculus (who will slow enemies and heal Aurora).
To level up she can transmute things via the NPC Johannes, and absorb shards over time to upgrade her abilities. Defeating bosses will push her even further, giving her a similar arc to Miriam where she can unlock new movement powers to traverse to more areas.
Thankfully, like some prior DLC, starting as Aurora is streamlined: you just start a new save file and choose between Miriam, Zangetsu, or Aurora with a handy menu (505 also reminds us that selecting Bloodless is possible with naming a save "BLOODLESS" in caps).
So as per usual, the crossover character will arrive on March 31 on PC, PlayStation, and Xbox platforms, but not Switch. The latter will arrive "at a later date," which is code for "whenever we can get it even remotely playable."

[Update: The "later date" Switch edition of the Bloodstained Child of Light crossover has finally come. It was released on June 3, 2022.]

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You have Final Fantasy XVI on the brain if you’re anything like me. This game, which Square Enix’s Creative Business Unit III studio is developing, has admittedly been on my mind since Square Enix revealed it in 2020. However, it’s especially front and center today after the FF XVI trailer that aired during yesterday’s State of Play. 
That trailer featured new looks at gameplay, more information about the warring kingdoms, including the Empire, surrounding the story, and the key figures at the heart of it all. Yesterday’s trailer highlighted these characters because they seem to have the ability to transform into completely, or at least embody, the primals or summons seen throughout the Final Fantasy franchise – primals and summons such as Ifrit, Bahamut, Odin, Shiva, and more. Following that trailer, Square Enix has uploaded some new screenshots of the beautiful landscapes in FF XVI we’ll be trekking across, and they look fantastic. Check them out for yourself below: 

As you can see, they feature new looks at different parts of this world that we haven’t yet seen in trailers, which have focused more on the story and combat of the game than the actual setting. These screenshots shed new light on the setting, though, including multiple locales we’ll likely be visiting when the game is released next summer. 
For more, read about how an easy mode for FF XVI could be on the way, and then check out this new FF XVI art that reveals exciting story details.

The Johto region is coming to Pokémon Smile! If you — like many of us — had forgotten about the smartphone app that encourages kids to brush their teeth, then don't feel too bad. The app only received its first update last November, and The Pokémon Company has finally scrubbed up enough for a second.
Version 2.0.0 adds over 100 Pokémon to Pokémon Smile, including all of the Johto region 'mons. The Gold & Silver community needs to get ready for how cute some of these things look — we could just squish them! We've grabbed a handful of favourites, but you can check them all out over on Serebii!

Eagle-eyed Street Fighter fans, who understandably picked through yesterday's Street Fighter 6 gameplay trailer with a fine toothcomb, quickly uncovered a "leak" (I see you, Capcom), that consisted of several flash frames — buried deep within the trailer — that named multiple characters for the exciting-looking sequel.
And then... mere hours later, everything blew wide open...
Earlier this morning, multiple online communities, including 4Chan, Twitter, and ResetEra, began sharing an image that seems to reveal the Street Fighter 6 launch roster in its entirety, spotlighting 22 characters via some pretty badass-looking artwork. If you want to quit my rambling and get to the goods, then you can check out the full image below, as compiled and identified by Reddi…]]></summary>

Today's State of Play may have been a lot shorter than I was expecting – and missing one or two huge titles I thought would be there – but it was a great presentation nonetheless.

And while the big-name, heavy-hitters bookended the show, the trailer that got me most excited was the one giving us a fresh look at Season: A letter to the future from Scavengers Studio.
Originally revealed at the 2020 Game Awards, Season: A letter to the future tells the story of the protagonist recording the sights and sounds of a breathtaking world as it comes to the end of its season. Rather than try and save the people who're sticking by this presumably doomed land, the protagonist aims to capture the world in all its …]]></summary>

The next generation of Street Fighter is aiming for 2023. Today, we got a look at what's in store for Street Fighter 6 with some new trailers, featuring fighters, commentary, and a new single-player mode.
Today's State of Play trailer showed some full-on fights in the new engine, which according to the PlayStation blog is Capcom's own RE Engine. The general look is a bit more colorful, with lots of paint and graffiti splashes.
As for the roster? First up are two newcomers. Well, relative newcomers; Luke already made his debut in Street Fighter V as a preview of what's in store. He uses mixed martial arts and can pull off DDTs on people. Jamie, meanwhile, is a peacekeeper who follows in the footsteps of Yun and Yang. Returning to the roster are a…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new trailer for Final Fantasy XVI was released during today's PlayStation State of Play, and it revealed a whole lot of war, turmoil, and primals. 
It also gave us extended looks at gameplay and a summer 2023 release window, which might come as a surprise considering producer Naoki Yoshida said in April that FF XVI was near the end of development. The trailer, which dove deep into the story of FF XVI, focuses on the war that will soon be waged between warring kingdoms, with the Empire seemingly leading the charge. At the heart of this war are multiple key figures who appear to have the ability to transform into (or at least embody) primals, which have traditionally been summons in Final Fantasy games.
Check them out for yourself in the trailer below: 


Here are the primals/summons seen in the trailer: 
Phoenix
Titan
Garuda
Bamuh
Shiva
Odin
Bahamut
Ifrit
Elsewhere in the trailer, we get new looks at the game's combat, which seems to contain some unique boss fights that will feature health bars on the top of the screen. The combat throughout the gameplay looks quite flashy, too, with plenty of spin attacks, fire, and more. At the bottom right is a weapon wheel of sorts that seems to be something players can customize, complete with items, a jump action, an attack action, and a slew of magic attacks to utilize. Hopefully we learn more about all of this soon!
Final Fantasy XVI is being developed by Square Enix's Creative Business Unit III's studio, and it will be released in the summer of 2023. For more, read about how an easy mode for FF XVI could be on the way, and then check out this new FF XVI art that reveals exciting story details.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We haven't seen the jaw-dropping, peaceful-seeming indie since last year. Just a few months after its debut at The Game Awards, the title seemed to be stalled after several hostile workplace allegations. However, today's State of Play proved the game is still in development and aims to come out in Autumn. The unexpected release window is coming up quickly, but the gorgeous new trailer suggests Season: A Letter to the Future will be ready.


Season won't task you with fighting monsters or saving the world. Rather, the game puts the player in the shoes of a traveler named Estelle, who is recording everything around her for posterity. There are hints that Season's sweeping vistas, sun-drenched fields, and flowing waterfalls won't be around for future generations. The trailer explains that no one knows what will happen when "the season" ends, which makes the job of documenting the world for the future so important. We see the protagonist going about this assignment is various ways, like writing in a journal, taking photos, and recording audio. She also stops off to speak with the people around her while exploring the landscape on her bike.
As the narrative designer, Meg Hutchison explains:
The title looks like it is shaping up to be a pensive and beautiful experience when it comes out on PlayStation consoles and PC this fall.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony's State of Play debuted a quirky dating-action game called Eternights. In it, independent developer Studio Sai invites you to find love in the most trying times – during an apocalypse.  
The game challenges you to make the most of life during this catastrophic situation. That means finding life and saving the world. When a mysterious entity infects humans and turns them into monsters, you must race against the clock to find an answer for survival, especially if you want to save your new relationship. In the game, you scavenge, dungeon crawl, and date your way to answers. But be aware that you're doing it all on a deadline, with a clock constantly ticking, reminding you to meet your deadlines.
Studio Sai promises dungeons with traps and puzzles, alongside fun dancing minigames. You also get to pick from a cast of five characters for your romantic pursuits, each with their own unique stories and skills to help you battle. The action showcased in the trailer looked fast-paced and featured mostly hacking and slashing away at baddies while using the face buttons to unleash powerful skills and magical abilities. There was even a motorcycle sequence to get your adrenaline pumping. You can watch the trailer above to see it all in action for yourself. 
So get ready to hold hands, makeout, and fight to stay alive when Eternights debuts on PS5, PS4, and PC sometime in early 2023.]]></summary>

Not only did the next installment of the legendary fighting game franchise make an appearance, but there was plenty of in-game footage shown, along with a second trailer showing a revolutionary new feature. 
First, the footage shown in the State of Play introduced a new single-player mode for SF6 called World Tour, which has players roaming the streets in an open world picking fights with other world warriors. The other is Battle Hub which is where players can throw down in matches online. Capcom states the mode will "further expand the scope of player communication and engagement."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you thought football (both types) would continue being popular in the year 2030, you are apparently wrong. A new bloodsport called rollerdrome will apparently become all the rage in that year. Rollerdrome is in development at Roll7, the studio behind the OlliOlli series, and will be published by Private Division on August 16 for PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and PC.
Anyone can compete in this deadly game, but the deck is stacked against them, as they take on house players (much like the American Gladiators show). The goal of each competitor is to achieve the highest score possible, by combining rollerskate tricks with eliminations. The player assumes the identity of Kara Hassan as she enters her first match. Your goal is to rise the ranks and hopefully become the Rollerdome champion – meaning you stay alive.
“It’s been amazing to see this project come to life from the original prototype that received a lot of love online, all the way to the brutal and intense experience it is now – thanks to the amazing work of the team at Roll7,″ Paul Rabbitte, creative director at Roll7, said. “We’re really excited for players to jump into Rollerdrome.”]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new trailer for Stray, the adorable cat game first revealed in 2020, was released during today's PlayStation State of Play and it featured new looks at gameplay and the exciting news that we can play it next month. 
That's because Stray will hit PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and PC on July 19. As for the trailer, it showcased more of the behind-the-cat, third-person (err, third-feline?) gameplay central to the game. As previously seen, this stray cat inhabits a very cyberpunk-esque world, filled with robots and more. As for the titular stray cat's place in all this, it seems they're on a mission to help inhabitants of this world and ultimately, find a way home. 
You can watch the trailer for yourself below: 


Here's what publisher Annapurna Interactive has to say about Stray: "In Stray, players take the role of a stray cat who must untangle an ancient mystery to escape a long-forgotten cybercity amidst the detailed neon-lit alleys and the murky environments of its seedy underbelly. Along the way, the cat befriends a small flying drone, known only as B12. With the help of this newfound companion, the duo must find a way out."

        <updated>2022-06-02T22:35:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today’s State of Play is bringing an array of exciting projects that are on deck for PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and the upcoming PlayStation VR 2, but few are as anticipated as Callisto Protocol, the upcoming horror game from Striking Distance Studios. The game got a new trailer at today’s presentation, along with a December 2 launch date.
For those not in the know, Striking Distance Studios is led by Glen Schofield, the same person who helped lead development of the original Dead Space way back in 2008. Even as EA is actively working on a remake of that original game, Schofield’s team is charting out a new universe of horror that is clearly inspired by the gameplay and visual palette of that older game.
In the new trailer, we get an extensive glimpse at the gory and terrifying gameplay in store for players when the game launches later this year. We see protagonist Jacob Lee as he makes his way through one scary-looking outer space locale to the next, often with the looming presence of the gas giant planet of Jupiter overhead.  
Jacob wanders through tight and dimly lit corridors before an array of monsters manage to get to him. We see an interesting mix of melee and ranged weapons that the scared hero can wield. But even with some helpful toys, things don't always go well for Jacob. Striking Distance is pulling no punches in regard to what happens to their lead character if players don’t manage to pull him out of trouble. In one especially disturbing concluding sequence, we see one of the creatures tear a portion of his head and face off in what is almost certainly a preface to a game over screen.
The Callisto Protocol just happens to be this month’s cover story at Game Informer, and you can head over to our game hub to check out all the info we’ve got on the game as it becomes available.
In the meantime, check out the trailer in all its creepy glory, and watch for The Callisto Protocol's release on December 2 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tunic is finally making its way to Sony's machines. Announced Thursday during the most recent State of Play livestream, the indie darling will be released on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 on September 27 of this year. 
When it was released on Xbox consoles and PC back in March, Tunic received near-unanimous acclaim from critics, who most often cited its Zelda-like exploration and Souls-like combat. It didn't hurt that the game, which stars a little fox on a big adventure, was painfully adorable. As we said in our review, "Tunic is a stunning achievement that manages to embody the best of nostalgia while being completely refreshing. It’s absolutely a must-play gem."
Check out the announcement trailer right here:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony opened Thursday's State of Play livestream by announcing the long-rumored, often-leaked Resident Evil 4 Remake. While the brief trailer didn't show much in the way of gameplay, it did show various locations and characters from the game, and most importantly, a release date: March 24, 2023.
Most strikingly – and predictably – the new Resident Evil 4 looks leagues better visually than its 2005 counterpart. During the minute-long trailer, we see protagonist Leon Kennedy, antihero Ada Wong, Ashley Graham, Luis, and brief glimpses of antagonists Osmund Saddler and Bitores Mendez. The trailer also shows quick looks at Salazar Castle and the iconic village from the beginning of RE4 and the baddies that inhabit them. The voiceover seems to indicate the game's story has been expanded and will act as a more direct sequel to Resident Evil 2, which also stars Leon as its protagonist. 
The trailer ends with a brief tease that VR content is also in development for Resident Evil 4. 
See the trailer in full below.


This is just the latest in the long line of Resident Evil remakes – which, if you're being exact, starts all the way back on the GameCube with the remake of the original 1996 game. In 2019, developer-publisher Capcom released a remake of Resident Evil 2, which was then followed by a Resident Evil 3: Nemesis remake in 2020. And if you're being technical, this is actually the second Resident Evil 4 remake in as many years – kind of. Last year, Capcom partnered with developer Armature Studios on the excellent Resident Evil 4 VR.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new Horizon Forbidden West update was surprise announced during today's PlayStation State of Play stream and it's out now. 
It brings many new highly requested features to the game, including New Game+, transmog, and more. More specifically, this update, which can be downloaded now, will allow players to begin a brand new game with all of their endgame gear. If they find a new gear set they prefer, they can take on all the stats of it while keeping the look of their favorite set thanks to transmog. 


Elsewhere, this update allows players to completely reset their skills and redistribute skill points. That's going to be especially helpful for players who need to reshape their build in a new difficulty now live in Horizon Forbidden West: Ultra Hard difficulty. 
Guerrilla Games has been hard at work fixing visual problems with the game through multiple patches, such as shimmering in foliage and elsewhere, and today's update includes "improved visual fidelity." There's no word on exactly what that addresses but it's probably safe to say the game will look better after installing the update. Finally, the last thing in today's update is the inclusion of new weapons to find and new trophies to obtain. 


Horizon Forbidden West is out now exclusively on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 and today's surprise update can be downloaded right now. While waiting for it to download, read Game Informer's Horizon Forbidden West review and then check out this adorable Aloy nendoroid figure.

Find out why the machines are attacking." Today's Sony State of Play brought fans another look at Guerrilla Games' VR adventure, Horizon Call of the Mountain, though the trailer didn't specify a release window. However, it did reveal some of the game's big narrative plot points. The trailer, which you can watch below, was also filled with lush environments and showed off several impressive, first-person shots of the world's monstrous machines.


You'll be playing as Ryas, an entirely new character, who was once a Shadow Carja. He finds himself mysteriously released from prison by Blameless Marad, the Sun King's right-hand man, to combat a deadly threat. Skilled at climbing and archery, Ryas ends up washed ashore after a Snapmaw attacks his two captors. The wild rapids look like they'll be an experience in the PSVR2 game's campaign, but players can check out even more rushing waters in the Call of the Mountain River Ride. This bonus feature offers to show you Horizon's world in a totally new way. 
A post on PlayStation's blog offered more insight for players who are ready to jump into the Ryas' story, saying:
But that's not the only Horizon news from today's event. The State of Play followed up Call of the Mountain with an announcement that Horizon Forbidden West is getting a huge update, with New Game + and more.]]></summary>

A few of these reveals are games designed exclusively for the forthcoming PlayStation VR2 headset. We still haven't gotten our hands on this highly anticipated device, and today Sony made the wait for this moment all the more difficult with the announcement that Resident Evil Village, The Walking Dead: Saints & Sinners – Chapter 2: Retribution, and No Man's Sky are all in development for it.
The footage for Resident Evil Village doesn't make the experience look much different, as it was already first person, but if it's anything like the other Resident Evil experiences, the headset will up the terror and immersion.


The Walking Dead gave us glimpses of using a chainsaw against zombie hordes, as well as other sharp instruments and firearms. Skydance Interactive and Skybound Entertainment say the game is slated to release in late 2022 for PSVR2.


No Man's Sky looks absolutely stunning, but we'll have to wait to get our hands on it to see if it's any different than the PC version.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Super Nintendo World opened in Universal Studios Japan last year, and word of mouth (and various YouTube videos featuring walkthroughs and more) says it’s a great theme park addition. Universal is clearly a fan of it because Super Nintendo World expansions have received the greelight at both Universal Studios Hollywood and at the Universal Studios theme park in Florida. 
Now, we know the first Super Nintendo World in the U.S. will open in early 2023 in Hollywood. This news comes by way of the official Universal Studios Hollywood Twitter account, which revealed the early 2023 timeframe today alongside a picture that reveals Mario is no longer the short king he’s always been. Instead, he has extra long legs that – I’m going to be honest – ain’t right. Luigi is the tall one, Universal! Not Mario!!
Get ready, #SuperNintendoWorld is coming to Universal Studios Hollywood in early 2023. pic.twitter.com/pCYaeHgWsq

This Twitter account also posted a quick teaser of the Mario Kart ride that will be at Super Nintendo World when it opens next year, and it looks amazing. It features not just traditional animatronics and in-ride sculptures but digital elements, too, in the form of screens and some kind of special glasses. Universal says we’ll be able to “ride through iconic courses, throw shells, and collect coins to beat Team Bowser” in the ride.

While waiting for this theme park addition to open, read about the Super Nintendo World already open in Japan and then tour the park with Shigeru Miyamoto. Read about how Universal Studios Japan and The Pokemon Company are teaming up to create a “revolutionary” theme park experience after that.

Revealed today with a fancy new trailer that showcases gameplay and cinematics from the game, Shiny Shoe describes Inkbound as a mixture of action RPGs, tactics games, and roguelikes. It looks great, too, and you can check it out for yourself in the announcement trailer below: 


“Inkbound takes players on a journey through procedurally generated storybook worlds, battling monsters that are set on unraveling the nature of reality itself,” a press release reads. “Players can dive in solo or party up via online co-oop in hybrid real-time/turn-based encounters. All the while, heroes become more powerful the deeper they progress in each roguelike run.”

Join Game Informer as we react live to everything shown during this State of Play presentation live on Twitch!
Watch on Twitch!
Your host for today's exciting show is the one and only Alex Stadnik. The big man will kick off the proceedings live starting at 4:45 p.m. CT for a little preshow where he'll give you some predictions and bring the hype. But what can people expect from today's State of Play? According to the official PlayStation Blog, fans can look forward to: "exciting reveals from our third-party partners, plus a sneak peek at several games in development for PlayStation VR2." We know one of those games is Horizon Call of the Mountain, developer Guerrilla Games' and Firesprite's collaboration featuring one of Sony's biggest franchises.
We know PSVR2 will be featured, but what else can fans look forward to? With an emphasis on third-party titles, there's been plenty of speculation on whether or not Capcom or Square Enix may make an appearance. The former has plenty for PlayStation fans to be excited about, including Resident Evil Village DLC and the recently announced Street Fighter 6. The latter also has big games coming to the PS5, including Forspoken and Final Fantasy XVI. Will any of the games listed make an appearance? Did I just jinx us, and now we're not getting anything listed in this article? Only time will tell, but that's why you have to tune in later today.
Thank you so much for watching. If you enjoy our watch-along streams, be sure to subscribe to our Twitch pages to get notified the second we go live and to get access to our tremendous exclusive Discord.]]></summary>

        <updated>2022-06-02T17:29:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[No longer shall it be called Dragon Age 4, as developer BioWare has revealed a new name for the upcoming RPG that will henceforth be known as Dragon Age: Dreadwolf.
A blog post announcing the title also goes into one possible meaning behind it. It's of course a reference to Solas, AKA The Dread Wolf, who happens to share a moniker with the game, although with a slight difference in spelling. Once an ally to players, this Solas is being set up as the big bad in Dreadwolf. The post describes him as maybe being "an ancient elven god, but some say not. Others say a betrayer of his people…or a savior who now seeks to rescue them at the cost of your world. His motives are inscrutable and his methods sometimes questionable, earning him a reputation as something of a trickster deity—a player of dark and dangerous games."
Dragon Age: Dreadwolf and Solas' machinations won't see the light of day this year, according to the post, at least not in any playable form. However, there will be more information coming about the game before the year is over. Outside of that tease for upcoming details, there isn't much more to learn about the next chapter in the Dragon Age saga in the immediate future. So until then, enjoy knowing the official title and the logo above, which the studio does leave open for more meaning than just a reference to Solas.]]></summary>

Patch 2.80 for Granblue Fantasy Versus is ushering in three new mechanics that will undoubtedly change the game in massive ways. First is Rush, a tactical move that dashes the character forward to quickly close the distance on the opponent and strike when they least expect it. Similarly, Backshift is a dash backward that allows for a quick escape from pressure or a dodge to use in dicey situations, like back-dashing on wakeup to foil the opposition's advanc…]]></summary>

Of course, it’s important to note that since this is the lineup of games available today in Japan, there’s the possibility this lineup could be just for Japan. The U.S. lineup, which launches on June 13, for example, could be completely different. Only time will tell. However, the Japan lineup could, at the very least, be a great indication of what’s to come.

I spent a day in EA Orlando's offices to learn how this year's game pushes the series forward and applies lessons learned from previous years to deliver several key improvements in this year's product.

And then it disappeared again, until today, when Chucklefish released five new images of the witchin' RPG alongside a fancy new Steam page. 
“Welcome to Witchbrook,” a tweet reads. “Enjoy this magical sneak peek into the town of Mossport with these brand-new-fresh-out-of-the-oven screenshots. Wishlist now on Steam.”

She's the first UK monarch to manage 70 years on the throne, most of the other ones having killed each other or somesuch. The country, specifically England, has responded to this by going absolutely off the boil, represented even in digi-form with a virtual street party map in Minecraft.

The 16-minute-long presentation showcased some of Sunbreak’s new areas, debut monsters, and gameplay tweaks. We also saw variations on well-known monsters that fans can encounter in the fresh experience. And while this gave us a lot to chew on, we couldn’t wait to explore all the new changes ourselves. We recently sat down with Sunbreak’s team and got a hands-on preview of the expansion, which featured two different quests, a peek at unique locales, characters, and, of course, monsters.

I recently faced off against the massive golden dragon during a hands-on session for Sunbreak, the upcoming expansion pack for Monster Hunter Rise, and it battered me repeatedly for the best part of an hour. It has become the flying white whale to my dual blade wielding Ahab, and I left the preview event determined to chop it to bits when the DLC finally arrives later this month.


Sunbreak’s new master rank quests aren’t messing around, basically. It seems Capcom have taken criticisms that the base version of Monster Hunter Rise didn’t provide challenging enough end-game content to heart, and have loaded the expansion with some truly agonising encounters purpose-built for returning veterans.

Novel concepts are worth their weight in gold, and Card Shark comes out swinging with an idea you’re unlikely to have encountered before. Set in 18th century France, players take on the role of a destitute and mute drink server who is lifted into high society by a puffed-up card cheat. Along the path to riches, a deep conspiracy is uncovered, touching the lives of everyone in upper-class society, and playing out in backroom parlors, Corsican pirate dens, and royal palaces. It’s a clever and appealing setup, but it can only carry the game so far. With gameplay that feels like a chore from begi…]]></summary>

        <updated>2022-06-01T18:53:38.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Variety reported last year that a Twisted Metal series was on the way from the writers of Deadpool, and then we later learned the show will debut on Peacock. 
Anthony Mackie, perhaps best known as Falcon in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (although he does have a new role in it now), was cast as the series’ star last September and now we know who will be playing the most iconic character from the Twisted Metal franchise, Sweet Tooth. It will be none other than Will Arnett, the voice of Batman in The Lego Batman Movie and the titular character in Bojack Horseman. 
This news comes by way of Variety, which reports that Arnett will “voice” Sweet Tooth, which kind of makes it sound like Sweet Tooth will either be a CGI character or the person acting as Sweet Tooth won’t be voicing him. Or, of course, perhaps Arnett will play Sweet Tooth on set, too, while also voicing him in post-production, given the whole head-on-fire part of the character. Variety reports that the show’s Sweet Tooth is “described as a hilarious and terrifying hulk of a man, who is as emotional as he is cunning,” and a “lover of chaos.”
“[This] majestic rage-filled killer dons an ever-smiling clown mask and uses ‘Lost Vegas’ as his own personal kill-ground, all while he drives his infamous doomsday ice cream truck,” Variety writes.
The publication reports that Arnett was long-rumored for this role in addition to working as an executive producer for the show. Arnett joins Mackie, Stephanie Beatriz (Encanto, Brooklyn 99), Thomas Haden Church (Spider-Man 3), and Neve Campbell (the Scream franchise) in this series.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ever have an idea that you regret the instant you commit to realising it? That's how I feel about my decision to rank all of Elden Ring's major locations. It turns out that, not only are there a lot of locations in Elden Ring, but the definition of a distinct location is largely up for debate. The opening area of Limgrave, for example, could be as many as four separate regions (East Limgrave, West Limgrave, Stormhill and Weeping Peninsula) depending on how you interpret it. That's not to mention all of the dungeons, caves, chapels, and other landmarks scattered throughout the Lands Between.
Yet like a newly minted Wretch squaring up to Margit the Fell Omen for the first time, I am prepared to plough on despite the pain that awaits. Below you'll find a comprehensive ranking of Elden Ring's major regions and legacy dungeons, based on the admittedly woolly criteria of how fun and interesting each location is to explore. So grab your map, put on your boots, and update your life insurance policy as we embark upon a grand tour of From Software's magnificent fantasy realm.

        <updated>2022-06-01T17:41:19.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yesterday, Sega debuted roughly 30 seconds of Sonic Frontiers open-world gameplay and today, you can now watch more than seven minutes of gameplay, courtesy of IGN. It’s basically an extended look at what was showcased yesterday and it looks great. 
Right off the bat, it’s beautiful – looking more realistic than any Sonic game before, too – and it’s clear that speed is the name of the game because there’s virtually nothing in the way of stopping the Blue Blur. It’s cliche to say, but it looks like if you see something in the distance, there’s a way for you to speed all the way over there, be it by rail, ramp, on ground, or something else. Take a look for yourself below:


As you can see, running isn’t all that’s in this extended gameplay look. There are plenty of Sonic staples, like on-ground boosts, bumpers, and more. Plus, there are towers that act as platforming challenges, tasking you with reaching the top. Elsewhere, there are simple puzzles to solve that involve stepping on lit switches as well as a speed wheel (think: hamster wheel, or hedgehog wheel, I suppose) that seems to do something to the surrounding area. Maybe it defogs a map, or unlocks new areas to explore. Only time will tell for now. 
Unfortunately, we don’t yet have a release date for Sonic Frontiers, but it’s coming sometime this year, so hopefully we don’t have to wait too much longer. While waiting to learn more, check out this trailer from last December, and then check out this other snippet of Sonic Frontiers gameplay that debuted yesterday.

You can imagine my surprise, therefore, when I discovered that Crucial are now selling the same drive at their site for £80.69 - a genuine bargain and the lowest price we've ever seen by some margin.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s officially summer, although you wouldn’t think it based on the amount of rain we’ve had up here in Newcastle this week. Still, that vague hint of warmth that lingers between the raindrops has got me dreaming of all those lovely things that make summer so appealing. Al fresco dining, excluding that bit where a wasp crawls into your glass of Fanta, which seems to happen to me a lot. Music festivals, minus the part where you queue for half an hour to have a wee. Oh, and obviously spending time on a beach somewhere hot, purposefully ignoring that horrible bit where you try to get your socks back on after taking a dip in the ocean and the sand scrapes against your skin.


OK, so maybe summer isn’t all it’s cracked up to be. Why do we even bother leaving the house, when we can stay indoors and play video games on PC instead? June is a little sparse when it comes to new releases (as is so often the case during these warmer seasons) but there’s still plenty on the horizon to keep you occupied.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Intel's 12th-gen motherboards are getting cheaper, which is handy if you're planning a new build around one of Intel's excellent 12100, 12400F or 12600F CPUs for gaming. One of the best deals we've spotted is for the Asus Prime B660M-A WiFi D4, which launched at £197 and is now down to £86 at CCL in the UK.
This motherboard uses better value DDR4 memory, two M.2 PCIe 4.0 slots and WiFi 6 on board, so it ticks a lot of boxes in terms of the essentials. You're missing some things from higher-end Z690 boards - like PCIe 5.0, USB-C ports and 2.5-gig networking - but nothing that affects gaming performance, at least in the here and now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Diablo Immortal is finally out on mobile devices, a full day earlier than expected for some regions. 
The entire Diablo Immortal launch, which will see the game hit iOS and Android devices everywhere and PC, is still slated for tomorrow, June 2, at 10 a.m. PT/1 p.m. ET. If you plan on playing the first-ever, built-from-the-ground-up-for-mobile Diablo game on a phone, then head to your app store to see if it’s available.
While waiting for it to download, check out our latest gameplay from it below:


“As we prepare to launch Diablo Immortal on June 2 at 10 a.m. PDT for iOS, Android, and PC in Open Beta, some players will see Immortal propagate on the Apple App Store and Google Play beginning the morning of June 1 PDT,” a blog post reads. “This is in part due to the nature of how mobile games rollout to ensure a smooth full launch for the mobile version of Immortal. To confirm when Immortal will be fully launched for your region on all platforms, please reference the below time map.” 
The blog post mentions that the game won’t launch in some Asia Pacific regions, including Hong Kong, Indonesia, Macao, Malaysia, The Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, and Thailand, until June 22. It will launch that same day in Vietnam but only on PC in Open Beta. According to Blizzard, these regions will receive dedicated game servers to bring players better connectivity and ping. 
For more information about this rollout, including a look at Blizzard’s current roadmap for Diablo Immortal, head to this “Roadmap To Hell.” After that, read Game Informer’s review in progress of Diablo Immortal, and then check out this Diablo Immortal segment of New Gameplay Today to look at how it runs on both mobile devices and PC.

Take a sheet of plain paper, turn it horizontal, draw two long lines across it, dividing it into three strips. That’s a level; that’s a side-scrolling environment. That’s what I’d do, basically all the time, basically every day. You could call me a budding game designer, only I had no knowledge of how to transfer my genius creations into digital form. I’d tried before, with Doom, but the editor was incomprehensible. Sectors? Vectors? Call me a particularly stupid child, but I just wanted to draw two long lines on a piece of paper.


Enter Speedy Eggbert, a budget-priced platform game that scored “the world’s first generous 4% review” in PC Gamer magazine. But I wasn’t aware of that yet. I was, though, aware of its big, shiny box on the shelves of Game, with its gorgeously embossed Eggbert and a reverse emblazoned with screenshots and features, including the most enticing few words I’d ever seen – “MAKE YOUR OWN LEVELS!”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Pokémon Company has released a new trailer for Pokémon Violet and Pokémon Scarlet and it reveals the new professors, four-player co-op capabilities, the new legendaries, the box art for the two games, and more. 
It also reveals that Pokémon Violet and Scarlet will hit Switch on Nov. 18. On that day, you'll be able to choose between the three starters: Fuecoco, Sprigatito, and Quaxly. They will likely be given to you by the new professors (yes, plural) of Generation 9: Professor Sada if you're playing Scarlet (left) and Professor Turo if you're playing Violet (right).
You can check them out in action in the trailer below:


Shortly after their introduction, the trailer reveals that four-player co-op will be in Scarlet and Violet, a first for the Pokémon series. It won't be limited to just online battles like in previous games, though – it seems we'll be able to explore the region with other players. Throughout the trailer, we get glimpses at returning favorites and new Pokémon, such as Pawmi, Lechonk (great name), and Smoliv.
Plus, we see what appears to be some very Pokémon Legends: Arceus-style sleuthing and monster catching too. 
The trailer concludes with the reveal of this generation's two primary legendaries: Karaidon, the red dragon-looking Pokémon that will reside on the box art of Scarlet, and Maraidon, the purple dragon-looking Pokémon that will reside on the box art for Violet. Both appear to live off the coast of this region, high atop some cliffs in the ocean. 

For more about Pokémon Violet and Scarlet, watch the original reveal trailer, which includes a nice look at this gen's starters, and then check out our living list of every Pokémon in these games confirmed so far.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You just heard the collective sigh of relief from achievement hunters all over the world because their hobby just got a lot more convenient. 
That’s because after a new Xbox update, you'll be able to view secret achievements from wherever you’re playing an Xbox game. Before this update, you simply could not – the console would let you know an achievement was secret, but you’d have to search online elsewhere to determine its objective. Starting this month, you can choose to reveal secret achievements, according to a new Xbox Wire blog post, as reported by IGN. 
“If you don’t mind spoilers or want a hint on any of the achievements in the games you’re playing, it’s easy to find the secret achievement details on your Xbox,” the blog post reads. “From within a game, open the guide and go to Game Activity > Achievements. When you see a secret achievement, you can now reveal details like the title, achievement description, and Gamerscore. And after you peek, you can go back and hide it or continue to display the details. 
“You can reveal secret achievements anywhere you like to play and track your achievements from Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One consoles, the Xbox app for Android and iOS, the Xbox app for Windows PC, and Game Bar on your PC.” 
Here’s a look at how it works: 
While waiting for this update to download, read about how Xbox and Bethesda are hosting a games showcase next week, and then check out Game Informer’s in-house predictions for that showcase after that.

Unfortunately, I wasn't able to see everything that Diablo Immortal has to offer after spending over 15 hours with the free-to-play handheld action RPG, but in lieu of a full review, I'd like to share some thoughts on my time with Immortal as the game is soon to be available for everyone to play on mobile devices and PC.
Much of Diablo Immortal is designed to look, sound, and feel like Diablo 3, and in my time leveling a Crusader, it nails those lofty expectations effortlessly. Never once during my time slaying the minions of evil have I felt like this was a reskin of another mobile game, imposter using the Diablo name, or that it f…]]></summary>

Ubuntu 22.04 also shipped with Mesa 22.0 as the latest stable version albeit the open-source OpenGL/Vulkan graphics drivers are quick to advance. So if you've been thinking about upgrading Mesa or the Linux kernel on your Ubuntu 22.04 system for better Linux gaming performance, here are some benchmarks looking at such performance impact for AMD RDNA2 / Radeon RX 6000 series graphics.]]></summary>

This significantly improved upscaling option, introduced a few weeks back in Deathloop (and more recently making it to Farming Simulator 22), completely replaces God of War’s FSR 1.0 setting, giving Radeon GPU owners a performance booster that comes much closer to Nvidia DLSS on quality.

The impeccable graphics and thought-provoking narrative shine so brightly in this puzzle/adventure title that the game’s defects, like the frustrating lack of direction, stand out in grimy, stark contrast. The moment I began playing, I was under the aquatic world’s monochromatic and disquieting spell. However, the magic was continuously dispelled as I increasingly encountered imbalanced challenges and tedious objectives.

Silt is a Limbolike, only it's Limbo under the sea. Other free-wheeling associations I have made include Minute Of Islands and, most weirdly, Gormenghast. But having mentioned the later, and because people who like Gormenghast really bloody like Gormenghast (a reasonable position), and respond to its evocation like Chekhov's dogs let loose at the eleventh annual Ringing World National Youth Championship competition, I'm now going to have to temper expectations back down.

In the tweet posted above, Keighley states that SGF will feature events and updates from over 30 partners, with more to be announced. For now, the line-up includes: 
2K
Activision
Atlus
Bandai Namco
Bloober Team
Capcom
Coffee Stain
Deep Silver
Devolver Digital
Digital Extremes
Dotemu
EA
Epic Games
Focus Entertainment
Frost Giant Studios

Level Infinite
Mediatonic
miHoYo
Netflix
PlayStation
Raw Fury
Samsung Gaming Hub
Sega
Square Enix
Skybound Games
Steam
Studio MDHR
Tribeca Festival
Warner Bros. Games
Xbox
Now that we have a clearer idea of which companies have something to show, the speculation can begin. Will Bloober Team reveal its long-rumored Silent Hill project or its already announced Layers of Fear sequel? Will Dotemu finally spill the beans on a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge release date? Square Enix has already teased something Final Fantasy VII-related for the event; could it be a Remake 2 reveal? We'll get all those answers and more next week.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sonic Frontiers was teased way back in 2019 before it was teased once again in 2021. It was originally supposed to drop last year, but it instead became a 2022 title, with a new trailer debuting at The Game Awards 2021. Now, as we anticipate the Blue Blur’s 3D return sometime this year, Sega has released a new teaser trailer that gives us just a taste of Sonic’s first open-world foray, and it looks awesome. 
This new teaser comes by way of the official Sonic the Hedgehog Twitter account, which released the trailer alongside news that Sonic Frontiers is getting the IGN First treatment in June. In fact, according to the tweet, we’ll be getting some world-exclusive reveals very soon, which, if this teaser trailer is anything to go off of, means we’ll probably be getting some extended looks at gameplay in June. For now, the teaser trailer below will have to do: 


As you can see in the trailer, there’s a lot going on in just this quick 30-second glimpse. There’s plenty of full-speed, open-world running, lots of rails to grind on, enemies to destroy, and it appears there are even tower-like checkpoints to activate or interact with. I’d wager you have to do this to open up more of the game’s open-world map, but that’s just a guess for now. Hopefully, we will learn more soon. 
What do you think of this gameplay teaser? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

This news accompanies word that they won't be available to you as a PlayStation Plus member until the new and revamped service goes live, which is set for June 13 in the U.S. 
"When the all-new PlayStation Plus launches into your region, these titles will be available as monthly games to all PlayStation Plus members including those on the PlayStation Plus Essential Plan (which includes the same benefits PlayStation Plus members get today)," the PlayStation Blog post reads. 
You have until June 6 to download last month's free games, which were FIFA 22, Tribes of Midgard, and Curse of the Dead Gods.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here we have another AOC gaming monitor, except it’s not just by AOC, but by posh car makers Porsche? It’s the Porsche Design AOC Agon Pro PD32M, a premium 4K / 144Hz beast of a display, and is in fact the second hardware collaboration between these unlikely bedfellows.


It’s also far more ambitious (and expensive) than 2020's AOC Agon PD27. It’s flat rather than curved, but goes for both a higher resolution and a larger 31.5in IPS panel. Its DisplayHDR certification also rises from 400 to 1400, fuelled largely by a switch to more advanced Mini LED backlighting: the same sort as the Asus ROG Swift PG32UQX, one of the best 4K gaming monitors. As a gaming screen, then, it’s got all the right tools, but what exactly about it is Porsche-like?

It's a bold play releasing a Soulslike in any year, let alone the year of Elden Ring.

Steelrising is one of these Soulslike seeds hoping to sink into our screens, sprout, and take root not only in the innards of our Panasonics, but our minds too. From what I've seen, it stands a chance of survival in a saturated land.

It's already much more polished than the demo, with more yet to come. It's a life sim with a bit of a Stardew Valley or Animal Crossing vibe, except instead of farming you are a witch called Ellie (size: small) living in a biome (type: forest).
In the story you start to free the nearby village from cursed vines, and this requires that you catalogue and collect ingredients for spells, and thence expand your repertoire of witchy recipes. At the same time you can trade spells and magical candy with locals for currency, which you can use to improve your little machines - a roaster, a caldron, a press for ingredients - to make even better things, more efficiently. It's a satisfying process of mastery and exploration. But that is not the important bit. The important bit is that Little Witch In The Woods is disgustingly adorable.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To be honest, I found Computex 2022 kind of underwhelming; this is usually the biggest event in the PC gaming hardware calendar, and had returned to Taipei after an all-remote 2021 show, but ended with only a smattering of major announcements in the bag. We got nothing on Intel’s Arc graphics cards, and Nvidia’s keynote revealed some new DLSS games but otherwise went light on GeForce deets.


That said, this year’s show wasn’t a bust either: there was fresh AMD Ryzen 7000 info, Corsair’s first crack at a gaming laptop and, at long last, some PCIe 5.0 SSDs you can actually buy. One day. In the future. That’s in addition to the wackier, moon-shooting tech on display, without which it just wouldn’t be Computex. So, in descending order - from the interesting and sensible to the blinking ludicrous – here are the PC gaming highlights from Computex 2022.

Since releasing last week, its all time peak of concurrent players is less than 400, and the average daily concurrents have slid down to around 100 people in only a few days. Worse, a fair chunk of this already dwindling community has been sorely narked off due to an apparent misunderstanding over how one of Legion's key features work.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Details of Cyberpunk 2077's first expansion have apparently leaked, including the dialogue for all its main quests. The leak apparently comes via files accidentally included with the Cyberpunk 1.5 patch released back in February, which were removed by CDPR hours later but discovered and saved by dataminers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Amazon Games’ fantasy MMORPG New World has received its latest update, ‘Arenas’, which means you can now smack other players upside the head in teams of three. The update brings PvP arena combat in best-of-five contests that Amazon say are for “glory and riches”, but then quickly qualifies that they're actually for unique stuff to decorate your in-game house with. The trailer makes the whole thing seem pretty wacky, see for yourself below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Friends and loved ones will agree, I have big “background character” energy. If I lived in the Star Wars universe, I wouldn’t be a Jedi or a Sith inquisitor. I wouldn’t even be one of those rebels who wear the long funny bike helmets. There would be no “Liam: A Star Wars Story” premiering on Disney+. Instead, I'd be the guy who changes the bedding at a grungy BnB on Tatooine. I would spend my days just sort of vibing on the fringes of all the excitement, blissfully unaware of the very important adventures occurring in a galaxy very-very-close-actually.


Maybe this is why Hardspace: Shipbreaker appeals to me so much. As a cutter, a nameless employee of the LYNX Corporation, you’re about as important to this particular vision of the future as the lad who polishes the floors on the Death Star. You are a nobody. But Shipbreaker relishes in how much that still makes you somebody.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been keeping a curious eye on AMD’s Software Preview Driver for May 2022; GPU drivers often promise “optimisations” that are rarely felt in practice, but this one genuinely sounded like a performance enhancing drug for Radeon graphics cards. In a community post, AMD asserted this particular Preview Driver could provide double-digit percentage gains in games running DirectX 11; claims that were backed up by early independent testing, like the creator of benchmarking tool CapFrameX getting an extra 24% out of Crysis Remastered.


This week, AMD Software Adrenaline Edition 22.5.2 released, making that new Radeon driver available to anyone who didn’t fancy switching to preview builds. Armed with an RX 6500 XT (a low-end card that desperately needs a performance kick), I gave the new software a whirl – and found that, for all those big numbers, Radeon owners should probably lower their expectations.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The word that comes to mind is "slick". In a genre defined by busy screens and showy light spectacles, Drainus does well to distinguish itself with such excellent animation. The enemies, and particularly the way they spill from levels like the battleship one, demonstrate some of the best sprite work I've seen for ages.
It's more than just stylish, too. As I've mentioned before, I'm bad enough at scrolling shooters, and outright averse to bullet hell, to make me less than an authority on which are the best. But Drainus held my attention for long enough that you should definitely give it a chance.
I'm not going to do a pun about the name. I'm not. I'm definitely not.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A while back I finished Yakuza: Like A Dragon and felt a little bit lost. You know the feeling, right? When you snap shut a piece of fiction you’ve been reading for days, or months even, it can be difficult severing those relationships you’ve built with its characters. Unless there’s a direct sequel, you must pull your pants up and shelve those emotions and move on.
Not that I struggle with letting go of characters and stories particularly, but my brain makes an exception for the Yakuza games. More specifically, Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio's games. I’ve reached a point where I’m ordering Lost Judgment with no intention of playing it for months - maybe even a year? It’s all a ploy to hang onto RGG’s characters and worlds for as long as I can; a sort of buffer to keep the unease at bay. Having nowhere to turn to next isn’t an option.

I think I need someone to roundhouse kick me into reality, before I fall asleep and wake up in the fantastical reams of Zenozoik for good.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Players of hit vamp ‘em up V Rising have taken to the game’s Discord server to request an anti-phobia mode to make some of its creatures easier on the eyes. It seems the offending boss in this particular instance is Ungora the Spider Queen, a high-level giant arachnid (the worst kind) who’s set up a fetching gothic domicile in the Cursed Forest’s Spider Cave. According to the mission summary for Ungola: “No living creature save for her children has ever entered and lived to tell the tale.” That’s enough to put anyone off.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week on the Electronic Wireless Show PC gaming podcast we're talking about the best our favourite noble failures, like the time I tried to make feta and red onion breakfast muffins. Ne'er touch the muffin pan since. No, of course it's our favourite video games that made big swings but didn't quite hit, a Nate Crowley-backed themed - and he kicks us off with a bid discussion about the infamous Jurassic Park tie-in game Trespasser. Try spelling "jurassic" properly first time; I've never been able too. 
Diversions this week are discussing classic UK subterranean tourist attractions Wookey Hole and Cheddar Gorge, and how Matthew's life could have been different if only he'd been Wookey Hole's witch mascot. Nate has bought a model kit for one of those massive excavation machines, which he says is "about as big as an Alsatian" and "basically a bin-bag full of girders". So he is turning it into an Orc sewage treatment plant. Standard week to be honest.

Sounds like my freshman year!" and then chortle at the open mic night audience. It's also tempting to say something like, "You know Two Point Hospital? It's like that, but at a university," but that would also be the lazy way out. In reality, the weirdest person I knew at uni only wore a top hat and an opera cape to campus once as a joke (and now has a proper job), and Two Point Campus is actually a way more complex and weird management sim than Two Point Studios' previous - and indeed, ongoing - hospital effort.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I saw the new Scream film earlier this year, the audience was a mix of zoomers sitting at the back giggling at how rubbish it was, and people my age and older fighting the urge to go, "No, see, it's actually really cool and good how they say what the plot is and then that actually is the plot!" There were just too many layers to peel off the metafictional onion for a generation who didn't love the original Scream from 1996. Heck, Scream 5 even opens with a joke about how kids today only like 'prestige' horror like The Babadook.
I'm convinced that there's a middle ground, where you can have a slasher horror that loves the tropes and knows how to work them, but still feels smart and fresh in 2022. And, preferably, stars pro-wrestler and part-time actor David Arquette. This week I played some of The Quarry.

Despite RRPs of over £400, you can get a basic model for £245 or a slightly fancier box for £270. Either way, you'll have a ton of storage space for backups, video projects, game install directories and other media. 
My colleagues at Digital Foundry pick these drives up regularly for their video production work, as capturing game footage and creating YouTube videos quickly causes standard hard drive sizes to fill up. You never want to be in a situation where you're forced to delete your old work to save the new stuff, so having a capacious backup like this is perfect.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Karl Fairburne, the titular Sniper Elite, is a pro at pinging baddies in the distance. The master of shooting Nazis in the balls across hundreds of metres. It’s a mystery, then, why the French Resistance constantly hand him objectives that require close-quarters combat. “Sneak into this chateau,” or “blow up that radar,” they say, probably with a smirk assuming that he won’t be able to pull it off. He can, of course, but it’s a monotonous series of missions that rarely asks you to get inventive with your trusty rifle.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As promised, Hitman 3 now has ray tracing support, added in a new patch alongside Nvidia DLSS and AMD FSR 1.0 upscaling capabilities. It’s no lightweight implementation either, combining both ray traced reflections and sun shadows that can really spruce up the game’s already-gleaming murder sandboxes. It’ll please shiny floor enthusiast Katharine, put it that way.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not content with just a foothold in the world of dad-dating visual novels, Game Grumps have decided to team up with Rogue Games to develop a psychological horror game. Homebody will channel the slasher film aesthetic of the 1980s, a stark tonal shift from the hand-drawn cheesecake colourfulness of Game Grumps and Rogue Games' first collaboration, Dream Daddy. Some of the same team are back for this one though. Watch the eerie trailer below.

The remake of Infinity Ward's famous (and infamous?) first-person shooter will release on October 28th, and Activision Blizzard decided to reveal some of its character art via the medium of a real world cargo ship.

I like my rhythm games on the other end of the scale, containing playful minigames with silly concepts and stories. Think Rhythm Heaven. Think Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan.

Think, perhaps, Melatonin. It's an in-development rhythm game about dreams merging with reality, and looks like exactly my thing. Watch the trailer below.

But then, just look at Temtem. It's not exactly hiding its inspirations. Temtem is undoubtedly like Pokémon, but set in a world populated by other players. After a couple of years in early access, the developers announced today that they're aiming for to hit 1.0 this September.

It's fully 3D space-ish combat, this time with colourful stylised levels, somewhere between technicolour neon and oddly minimalist. I don't want to start on a downer so let's say that my opinion of it improved the more I played it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Vampiric survival sandbox V Rising has, according to Steam’s player counts, entranced itself quite a following. That includes RPS’ own Ed, whose otherwise glowing preview mentioned some performance issues on Nvidia GPUs. 


I’m duty-bound to investigate any potential hardware hitches, though since V Rising is only in early access, this isn’t going to be the usual appraisal of how it performs on various PC hardware. That can wait until it’s had more of the spit ‘n’ polish treatment that typically comes with the status of actually being finished. That said, I have done a full sweep of V Rising’s graphics settings and their performance impact, so if your FPS count is melting like a Nosferatu on an ill-considered Corfu holiday, have a look below to see if you can make some fruitful tweaks.

Flanked by devs and squidged between other journos, I saw two short demos, one right at the start of his adventure, and the other much further in. I saw him clamber around Mordor (I think; it was mountainous at the very least) and then stealth around an Elven king's abode. It was... fine. Yes, I saw an early build and things could change, but I left that booth feeling a bit underwhelmed, in all honesty.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few days ago, Google announced the list of students accepted for this year's Google Summer of Code.
We are very proud to welcome 4 students this year who will be working on various parts of the project during the upcoming months.
Pragyansh Chaturvedi (aka Raikou) will work on improving our DIRECTOR engine. His effort will help us to allow support for many 90s-era adventure games made with the Macromedia Director authoring tools. By implementing more internal functions used by DIRECTOR, Pragyansh's main objective is to extend support for Meet Mediaband and The Journeyman Project (Win and Mac), making them fully playable without any glitches.
Michael Hayman (aka Quote58) is about to implement support for The Immortal. The game (released in 1990) can be described as a mix of genres involving RPG elements with action and puzzles. Many changes across different game variants (written in pure assembly code!) will make this an interesting challenge. This project is a continuation of a GSoC task initially started by a former student back in 2018.
Emanuele Grisenti (aka grisenti) will be working on a new engine, HPL1. The original sources for this engine got recently released by the original developer Frictional Games under GPLv3. The purpose of this project is to achieve a full port of this engine to ScummVM, with the goal of supporting the 2007 survival game Penumbra: Overture.
Avijeet Maurya (aka StableSteady) will pick up several incomplete engines: MacVenture, Avalanche, Glk-Scott, Pink and WAGE. Some of these engines are very close to completion, but not quite there yet. The main objective of Avijeet's task is to identify all missing features and fix existing bugs. The goal for his project is to bring the above engines to a stable state.
The team is very excited about the upcoming weeks – and we hope you are as well.
Please give a warm welcome to our new students! Let's make GSoC 2022 a huge success – together!
