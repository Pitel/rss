        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After previewing Final Fantasy XVI for roughly two hours, which you can read about here, I’m left most interested in the different styles of combat happening throughout the game. Clive has his own style of Devil May Cry-esque combat, party members controlled by A.I. up the ante, Clive’s dog Torgal can attack enemies, Clive can fight Eikons, and there are even Eikon vs. Eikon fights. It’s a lot for one game to juggle, and after my relatively short preview, I feel that the team is confident in this balancing act. 
But I wanted to learn more, so I asked FFXVI producer Naoki Yoshida, director Hiroshi Takai, and combat director Ryota Suzuki how the team manages so many unique combat experiences.

Publisher CyGames and developer Arc System Works have released several updates pertaining to Granblue Fantasy: Versus Rising, the expanded edition of the studios' gorgeous anime fighter, initially launched on PlayStation and PC back in the winter of 2020.
Perhaps first and foremost, we received a super cute teaser trailer for a brand-new DLC character, Anila. The... erm... "buxom" lass is an all-round fighter, who will combine rushdown and zoning-based fighting methods — afforded vast reach thanks to her trusty polearm while being aided and abetted by her flock of Divine Sheep.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Like my father before me
Last Man Gaming has announced that their breathtaking simulator, Forklift Extreme, will be making the drop to PC on March 16, 2023. Available as Forklift Extreme: Deluxe Edition, this is the first time the title has become available on a platform aside from the Switch and mobile.
If the name didn’t give it away, Forklift Extreme is a physics-based forklift simulator. Using “ultra-realistic physics” to bring this favored pastime to life, you can finally live out your dreams as a person who moves things with a vehicle. Or, as the press release puts it, “lifelike driver physics for an immersive experience like never before.” Okay!
[caption id="attachment_366251" align="alignnone" width="640"] Image via Last Man Gaming[/caption]
The Forklift Extreme: Deluxe Edition includes all the game’s DLC. There’s one where you move furniture and another with giant pumpkins. That’s cool. Pumpkins are cool.
Real talk, though. The press release email opened with the one-person developer saying they’re just a “big fan of physics simulation games.” You know what? I’m a big fan of programmer-driven games. Reviews of the Switch version aren’t bad but aren’t spectacular, but maybe the package is a lot more enticing with all the DLC included. The critics at least seem to agree that it’s exactly what it says on the box.
I was driven to write about this because my dad is a yard foreman at a lumberyard in my hometown. A big part of his job is driving a forklift. I wonder if there’s an option in Forklift Extreme for racing wheels, because I’d love to see how he would do in a series of challenges like this.
Forklift Extreme is available on Switch, iOS, and Android. Forklift Extreme: Deluxe Edition is coming to Steam on March 16, 2023.

After nearly 20 years at Capcom working on combat for games like Marvel vs. Capcom 2, Devil May Cry 4, and most recently, Devil May Cry 5, Suzuki decided he was ready for something new. 
That "something new" turned out to be FFXVI. The game’s director, Hiroshi Takai, and its producer, Naoki Yoshida, offered Suzuki a role at Creative Business Unit III, leading FFXVI’s combat design. And now, on June 22, players will be able to feel what I felt during a recent hands-on preview of the game: it’s very Devil May Cry meets Final Fantasy, in the best way.

I recently played about two hours of the game to dive deeper into the combat system’s mechanics, and you can read my preview thoughts on that here. 
But after playing some of the game, I spoke with the FFXVI producer Naoki Yoshida, director Hiroshi Takai, and combat director Ryota Suzuki about this continued shift to deep action and whether Final Fantasy will ever return to its turn-based roots. A…]]></summary>

Universal and Illumination are moving up the premiere date of The Super Mario Bros. Movie. The animated film is now hitting theaters on April 5 in several markets including the U.S., up from April 7.
While it hits two day earlier in the U.S., other regions will still have to wait a bit longer into April and May; Japan, specifically, will see The Super Mario Bros. Movie debut on April 28.

Nothing's been indicated as to why the date shifted. But hey, that's a little bit of Mario slightly earlier than expected.
Warp pipe to the future
Before April arrives, we're due for at least one more blast of information about the upcoming film. Nintendo has confirmed that the final trailer for The Super Mario Bros. Movie will air on March 9 in a special movie-focused Direct. The company also says no game information will be included in this Direct, so bad news for anyone hoping for a Mario game to pop up out of the warp pipe.
And honestly, I'm not sure how much more I need to see about the film before I walk into a theater. While I'm still a little iffy on some aspects, I was already in for a viewing when I heard Jack Black's Bowser for the first time. Anything else, all the fun jokes and references, that's just bonus.
The Super Mario Bros. Movie hits theaters in the U.S. on April 5, 2023.

We are rapidly nearing the release of The Super Mario Bros. Movie and the marketing campaign is in full swing. While we wait for the premier of the final trailer on 9th March, there is a whole lot more merch out there for us to get our hands on.
Perhaps the most anticipated of these was the collection of toys and figures from Jakks Pacific, which we first got a proper look at back in January. We at Nintendo Life were lucky enough to be sent a batch of these toys for closer inspection and our wonderful Community Manager, Gemma Smith, was kind enough to snap up a bunch of pictures to show off the range's detail.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bit of a wait
Apogee has announced that Wreckit Games’ open-world adventure Elements has succeeded in its Kickstarter campaign and is set to drop into Steam Early Access in the second quarter of 2024, followed by a release on various consoles in 2025.
Elements is a vibrant-looking open-world game set in the land of Elemythia. The game gives some mad Breath of the Wild smells, but it looks to differentiate itself by providing some home-building mechanics and two-player co-op. The developer is also touting a “Hollywood screenwriter” and the voice actress who lent her cords to Princess Zelda in Breath of the Wild.

I’m a bit of a fan of Apogee’s reinvention of itself. Utilizing its name recognition for publishing small and independent titles feels a bit like a return to the company’s original manifesto. I doubt we’ll be getting a rebirth of shareware, however.
With that said, while Elements definitely has a charming look to it, I think I’m hitting my tolerance limit for open-world games. It’s a genre that grows and grows as the years go on but still somehow stays exactly the same.
Nevertheless, the people have spoken, and the Kickstarter campaign sits at around $200,000 Canadian Loonies as of writing. The campaign runs until Friday, March 3, 2023, at 6:00 PM PST, so there’s still a bit of time to nab a tier if this all looks interesting.
If not, Elements will hit Steam Early Access in Q2 2024. The full title is expected to come to PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC in Q2 2025.

But during this preview, I was also able to participate in a group interview of FFXVI producer Naoki Yoshida, the game’s director Hiroshi Takai, and its combat director Ryota Suzuki. 
One facet of FFXVI’s development I was especially interested in is how Creative Business Unit III, the internal studio behind the upcoming game, is able to balance creating this new title while continuing to develop its extremely successful MMO, Final Fantasy XIV. Yoshida, who is FFXIV’s producer and director, says it’s not as different as you might think.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Devils and angel wings
Bandai Namco dropped a new trailer for Tekken 8 this morning, spotlighting another key character in the universe, Jin Kazama. The latest Tekken 8 teaser is all about the longtime series lead and his moves, both new and old.
As Jin says in his new character trailer, "strength isn't everything." But he is looking pretty dang strong in the Tekken 8 engine. It looks like Jin is incorporating his devil powers within his usual fighting style for some devastating hits.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkJQZ2Cz9-s
It's an interesting look for Jin that looks even better in the Tekken 8 arena. Tekken has usually impressed with its graphics, and that's held true for everything we've seen so far of the next entry in the series. Everything from the electric punches and slow-motion zoom-ins to Jin's best "One-Winged Angel" pose looks fantastic already.
Fist meets fate
Bandai has been drip-feeding out more and more characters from Tekken 8, though we've mostly seen the usual suspects. Trailers have spotlighted other mainstays like Kazuya Mishima and Nina Williams.
Still, even the familiar can be exciting when it looks as solid as Tekken 8 does. It's hard to get a gameplay gauge just from video, but it's looking like the next year or so could be a big one for fighting games. Street Fighter 6 is on the horizon, Project L is in development, and apparently Mortal Kombat 12 is happening too.
Tekken 8 still doesn't have a firm launch locked in, but it could be quite a time for fans of virtual scrappin' as all these new combatants enter the ring.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Destiny expansions are usually a decent "all day" affair
Destiny 2: Lightfall is out today, and the community is already buzzing with the ever-present question of every game release: "did you take off work for it?" Well, I'm playing it for work, does that count?
One of the last "take off of work" stories I can recall before I got into this gig full-time is Skyrim. I picked it up at a midnight launch Thursday night (early RIP for GameStop), took off that Friday, and played it through Saturday evening; which is when I cleared the main quest (yep!). I spent the rest of the weekend mucking around. There's nothing like a cozy atmosphere, fun food, and embedding yourself in an open world game. But back to Destiny.
Destiny is a breezy series if you're playing it casually
Having covered Destiny since the original game's alpha period, I'm no stranger to "taking off" (so to speak!) for these launches. The thing is, even if you're a casual player, most modern Destiny expansions have around a full day's worth of raw content to them. After that it's generally off to the gear grind, prepping for the raid, potentially doing some dungeon runs or Crucible PVP, and waiting for updates. But you can get the overall "gist" of the base expansion very quickly, and I'm sure a lot of folks are going to be doing just that with Lightfall today. Not a bad way to spend a Tuesday.
Weirdly, these kinds of live service games have a meta that typically involves gearing up as quickly as you can, and constantly running the toughest content so you can always be above the curve. So seeing players take off an entire week hasn't been out of the question. Either way, we're curious if you still take off work for games!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new fantasy IP from the ground-up
IO Interactive forged a name for itself through its Hitman series, but today it's announced a different kind of project altogether. The studio making an online fantasy RPG.
Announced in a blog post today, IO Interactive is building a new world and IP for an online fantasy RPG. It's built "from the core" to be around for years to come. And as IO describes it, it feels familiar, yet is unlike anything the company's done before now.
There are some touchstones mentioned in the blog post, ranging from Fighting Fantasy books that offered choose-your-journey opportunities to gathering around a tabletop. Heck, even being a game master.
"This idea – that a diverse group of individuals with different skills and strengths can work together and become more than the sum of their parts – is what inspires us," IO said in its announcement. "It inspires the fantasy world we are building – and it inspires how we build it. IOI now spans multiple distinct studios, from Copenhagen and Malmö in the north to warm Barcelona in the south. All studios take part in making all our games, including this new endeavor. People from all over the world with diverse personalities and skillsets are coming together to forge a new beginning."
Starting off on a new journey
Not many more details were shared, beyond the lone art teaser and blog post. It's currently code-named Project Fantasy, and IO is actively hiring for it.
IO Interactive has been building out the World of Assassination they started with the Hitman reboot, and are also working on a James Bond game, too. This online fantasy RPG adds another to the docket for the company, but I'm pretty keen on seeing what it turns out to be. IO's breakaway with the Hitman series turned out incredibly well, and I'd love to see what the crew does with an RPG setting. And, of course, whether Agent 47 is quietly lurking in the background. You never know!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Empty, if inkopolished.
The first paid DLC pack for Splatoon 3 is out now, and as expected, it adds Inkopolis from the first game as an additional hub area.
Players will need to wait for Wave 2 to really dig into some proper new content, though what this will entail exactly is still unknown at this time. For now, while the addition of Inkopolis is a nice throwback for long-time fans of the franchise, it doesn't appear to add anything substantial to dig into.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I really, really miss Sheva
Here's an odd but not unwelcome occurrence, Capcom has quietly updated the Steam/PC edition of its survival horror sequel Resident Evil 5. The new patch, now available to download on the Steam platform, adds split-screen local co-op, removes Games for Windows Live, and stomps a few bugs.
Originally released in 2009, Resident Evil 5 saw former S.T.A.R.S. operative Chris Redfield head out to West Africa, investigating a potential Bio-Organic weapon sale, led by terrorist Ricard Irving. Teamed with BSAA operative Sheva Alomar, the duo soon find that this case goes far deeper than mere weapons sales, and will bring Chris face-to-face with some welcome, and very unwelcome, faces from the past.
He also punches a boulder to death.
This Steam update is a long, long time coming, and the removal of Games for Windows Live support eliminates a frustrating hurdle in playing the game. Of course, the Resident Evil series has long moved forward from its heady, tank-controlled, RE5 days, but for those who still enjoy running through the entire franchise with pals, then this new update contemporizes the release for future efforts.
Now, if we can just see to giving Sheva her grand franchise return, that'd be just peachy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fails to live up to its hype.
When we first loaded up Redemption Reapers, we were in love with the aesthetic of the game. A dark and gritty tactical RPG with surprisingly good-looking cutscenes and haunting music was exactly the palate cleanser we needed after playing through Fire Emblem Engage. While those strong points never get old during this game, they are quickly overshadowed by shortcomings in the game’s design and execution.
Redemption Reapers takes place in a world under threat of being overrun by the Mort. These endlessly aggressive, partially feral creatures look very similar to orcs from Lord of the Rings and have about as much characterisation. They come in a variety of forms, each with different abilities and skills to cause chaos on the battlefield, but most are relatively straightforward. Stabbing them repeatedly is usually the ticket to victory.

You won’t find difficulty settings like easy, medium, and hard. Instead, there’s a story-focused mode and an action-focused mode. The story-focused mode will be easier, while the action-focused mode appears to be the default difficulty setting. And within each of these modes, there are special accessories that can be equipped to tailor the difficulty of combat to your liking.

More specifically, the Adonis Creed outfit will be available for purchase in the Item Shop starting Thursday, March 2, at 7 p.m. Eastern. If you don't want to wait until then, though, you have a chance to earn the outfit early by competing in the Creed Cup on March 1.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stay out of Davey Jones' locker
Get ready to moisten your diving gear, as Camel 101 has given us a peak at their upcoming FPS horror title, Beneath. Beneath bills itself as an “action-horror adventure” and is coming to PC, followed by Xbox Series X|S and PS5.
Playing as deep-sea diver Noah Quinn, you stumble across an underwater research facility in the ocean's murky depths. I’d really be interested in seeing a game about a research facility that is just operating without issue and maybe just developing flavors of drink mix, but of course, this one is infested with monsters. Actually, why not both? Why can’t it be a drink mix R&D facility that has an outbreak of dangerously delicious monsters?
[embed]https://youtu.be/qrHElrB5J5k[/embed]
In any case, Beneath will have you plumbing the oceans and uncovering the mystery of this facility while trading gunfire with foes and various unspeakable beasts. Beneath touts resource management where guns are plentiful, but ammunition is not. Combat is appropriately tactical, and sanity is short, as you’ll need to keep your sanity meter topped up. You’ll also spend some time exploring the facility's interior and exterior.
I like the creepy aesthetic. It reminds me of the episode of the X-Files, Død Kalm. The nautical utilitarianism and oppressive shadows provide an isolating effect. Developers seem to have discovered the horror potential of ocean settings, so Beneath is going to have to work to stand out, but the initial trailer seems promising.
Beneath is headed to PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PS5. No target release window has been stated.

However, toward the end of my preview, I was able to fight Garuda, one of the game’s Eikons, while controlling Ifrit, another Eikon. 
At this point in the game, roughly five hours in according to FFXVI producer Naoki Yoshida, Clive has little control over Ifrit. A special few in the world of FFXVI are Dominants, meaning they can tap into the power of an Eikon and even transform into them. Cidolfus, for example, can become the Ramuh Eikon.

LEGO Bricktales released on Switch in October last year to a number of lukewarm reviews (check out our thoughts at the bottom of this article).

The latest update to be announced is going to focus on Easter and will be launching with the holiday later on this year. Bricktales is all about solving small-world problems across a series of LEGO dioramas and the new Easter world is no exception. This time, you will be helping the Easter Bunny make chocolate eggs by navigating a number of chickens through a variety of obstacles.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following the release of Forspoken earlier this year, Square Enix has announced that the game's developer, Luminous Productions, will merge into the company. 
It's a strange announcement, given that Luminous Productions was already a studio under the Square Enix umbrella. But now, it seems that Luminous Productions as an individual entity will be no more and, thus, won't be seeing its name appear on future titles.
"The merger is part of the Company's efforts to bolster the competitive prowess of the Group's development studios, a goal set forth under its current medium-term business strategy," a press release reads. "Square Enix has developed numerous AAA high-definition (HD) games and possesses a wealth of intellectual property (IP) and content. Luminous Productions Co., Ltd. is meanwhile equipped not only with AAA title development capabilities but also technical expertise in areas such as game engine development. Combining the two entities will further enhance the Group's ability to develop HD games." 
As you can see, it's not that Luminous Productions' developers are no longer with Square Enix; it's just that the team has been merged into the wider Square Enix umbrella. As for why remains unclear. Perhaps it's the result of Forspoken's mixed reception at release, but that's speculation.

This is a special version made for media to experience. Contents may differ from the final version.
Each of the mainline, numbered Final Fantasy entries takes a departure from its predecessors. The series maintains its thematic through-lines in its summons, its monsters, and in names like Cid; but each release, especially from the PlayStation 2 onwards, reinvents itself too. Final Fantasy XVI is certainly no different.
We got a chance to go hands-on with a build of Final Fantasy XVI, showcasing just how the next entry in the series will handle and specifically highlighting combat. And really, its combat is the thing to talk about, as it’s already been shown to be a bit of a departure from the ATB systems of yore.

Making a new Final Fantasy is a big deal. The series has been running for over three decades, and each numerical entry leaves its own mark. Final Fantasy XVI isn’t just a new RPG in a long-running series, but one that has to carry a legacy and forge its own path at the same time.
In some ways, then, the creative team that’s been assembled for Final Fantasy XVI makes a good amount of sense. As part of a media preview event for XVI, we got the chance to sit down for a roundtable interview with four key members of the team: producer Naoki Yoshida, main director Hiroshi Taki, combat director Ryota Suzuki, and localization director Michael-Christopher Koji Fox.

With a family-friendly rating and whimsical storybook art style combined, we had initially guessed that this one was going to be a rather throwaway affair, a breezy prologue aimed at a younger audience that filled in some backstory and not much else.

Since the reveal of Final Fantasy XVI in 2020, my questions about the title have continued to grow. Mind you, my questions are firmly planted in the fascination of everything surrounding this game, like how Final Fantasy XIV studio Creative Business Unit III is developing the title with Naoki Yoshida in the producer role or how former Devil May Cry 5 and Marvel vs. Capcom 2 combat designer Ryota Suzuki is the game’s lead combat director. Will FFXVI feature the storytelling prowess of FFXIV? Will its combat go full stylish action?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just a few days after the one-year anniversary of Elden Ring's release, developer From Software has revealed that an expansion for the game is currently in development. 
Revealed by the official Elden Ring Twitter account, this expansion is called Shadow of the Erdtree. Not much is known about the expansion, but those familiar with the game's lore (especially those that have completed the game) might be able to piece together what this new adventure will consist of. Alongside the news, From Software has released what appears to be a piece of concept art for the expansion. 
Check it out for yourself in the tweet below: 
Rise, Tarnished, and let us walk a new path together.
#ELDENRING Shadow of the Erdtree, is currently in development.

This is exciting news for fans of Elden Ring, but given that From Software has only revealed the expansion is in development, with no release date or window in sight, it might be a while before our return to the Lands Between. 
In the meantime, read Game Informer's Elden Ring review to find out why we gave the game a 10.

After being revealed at the February Nintendo Direct, the first wave of DLC for Splatoon 3 is now here, bringing the Inkopolis hub world from the first game in the series over to the Switch.
The location is nothing but a new hub for the time being, with no noticeable bonuses being granted to those that choose to shop and play there rather than Splatsville. You might remember the location from 2015's Splatoon on the Wii U and while it remains mostly unchanged in its new Switch form, the graphics have received something of a facelift.

Destiny 2's mysterious creature, the Pouka, has been subject to much speculation ever since one was first seen back in early 2020. They've not been sighted much since then, but Bungie has released a Pouka figurine with the Collector's Edition version of Lightfall. As shown off in pre-release trailers, lore books, and Lightfall marketing materials, Poukas will be much more prominent throughout this campaign.
Still, there remains limited information about them. We've explored the lore books and trailers to discover all there is to know about these new mysterious mechanical creatures that could be seen floating around Neomuna on February 28.

It was with a heavy heart that we saw the Western release of action RPG Trinity Trigger get held back a solid six months following its Japanese debut last year, and while we still have a while to go before we can dive into the '90s-inspired adventure, publisher Marvelous Europe has now given us a Switch release date of 16th May 2023 (in Europe and Australia, at least).
The development team for this one — FuRyu — is made up of huge names in the RPG field. We've got worldbuilding artist Yuki Nobuteru (Trials of Mana), character designer Raita Kazama (Xenoblade Chronicles), scenario writer Yura Kubota (Octopath Traveler) and even composer Hiroki Kikuta (Secret of Mana, Trials of Mana). With experience like this attached, we have long considered the game as one to watch.

It's hard to overstate just how much of an impact Shigeru Miyamoto has had on Nintendo and the gaming industry at large.

So it's hard to imagine just what the company would be like without him.
Thankfully, Miyamoto himself has a pretty good idea.

We all knew it was coming, it was always coming, and now we know, for sure, that it's coming: Bandai Namco has revealed Shadow of the Erdtree, a DLC expansion for its critically acclaimed and multi-award winning fantasy adventure, Elden Ring. A release date was not announced.
Aside from a logo and a single image, developer FromSoftware is keeping tight-lipped regarding the new DLC and its contents. The concept art depicts a haunted plain from The Lands Between, occupied by what appears to be the ghostly gravestones of fallen warriors. A lone figure (Miquella?) rides across the landscape, seemingly headed toward a gnarled, towering tree, pictured far on the horizon.

It goes without saying that the Elden Ring DLC news will make the morning of many a video game fan. One of the most successful releases of 2022, Elden Ring would shift somewhere in the region of 20 million copies following its launch just over one year ago. The challenging adventure title would go on to win an array of Game of the Year plaudits, (including our own) and, as such, the player base will be ready and eager to head back into its epic world.
Elden Ring is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

The Forest was a terrific “get off my lawn” simulator. You built up your cabin in the woods, then spent most of the trying to keep cannibals from waking you up at night. This must be how all those gated community suburbanites see the world.
Released in 2018 (as long as you don’t count all those years in Early Access), it was and remains an indie darling. It was one of the big success stories in the post-Minecraft open-world survival boom.
I got into it a bit too late, I think. By that, I mean after it finished its run in early access. Having already experienced a lot from that trend, a lot of what made The Forest special, I had already seen enough of the sub-genre.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My day is ruined
If you are like me, you have taken small comfort in Chris Carter’s reliable coverage of the event Pokemon that can lay eggs in Pokemon Scarlet & Violet. Whether it’s Charmander or Froakie, the inclusion of baby Pokemon has been a nice bonus for the past 7-Star Tera Raid encounters. However, while the new 5-Star Walking Wake and Iron Leaves encounters have otherwise followed the rules of 7-Star raids, there is one crucial exception.
I am sad to report that, no, neither Walking Wake nor Iron Leaves are capable of laying eggs. Trust me, I tried everything. I got the perfect Ditto, I made an egg power sandwich, I even played "My Heart Will Go On." Neither Paradox Pokemon would make as much as a passing glance at a potential companion. To answer your follow-up question, yes it was the DragonForce cover of "My Heart Will Go On." Of course I used the most romantic version, do you think I’m crazy?
[caption id="attachment_366036" align="alignnone" width="640"] Screenshot by Destructoid[/caption]
This shouldn’t be a terribly big surprise. Paradox Pokemon can’t lay eggs, so your only option for duplicate Paradox monsters is to catch them yourself. That’s a bit harder with Walking Wake and Iron Leaves, as you can only catch one of each while their respective challenge is live. Since the event info does stipulate that these monsters “may be… obtainable through other methods,” it’s possible they will appear more commonly in future DLC. For now, keep your catches of Walking Wake and Iron Leaves safe. At least they won’t elope and move to Unova anytime soon.

A special board-like arena and tokens are also teased as a commemorative set of sorts.
Billed as a "premium set that will last a lifetime," this is a joint venture between Nendo, Creatures, and The Pokemon Company.

In some ways, Metroid has always been a series about the tension between discovery and destruction. Nearly every tool in Samus' ever-growing arsenal serves two purposes: it helps her find something new, and it helps her tear it to shreds. Sometimes unearthing secrets is wrecking shop, as in the case of the series' iconic-but-divisive destructible walls. But Metroid is most interested in finding the line between investigation and annihilation in Metroid Prime.
Most would agree that the most dramatic difference between Metroid Prime and earlier games is the jump to the third dimension. This opens the door for all kinds of structural shakeups, but my personal favorite is the Scan Visor. With the Scan Visor, Samus can learn details about nearly every element of her env…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Trust me, bro. You’re gonna cry.
There are a lot of forgettable little indie RPGs floating around on the Nintendo Switch eShop, but it’d be a mistake to lump developer Odencat’s Meg’s Monster in with them. In fact, despite appearances of turn-based battles and an underworld filled with monsters to battle, we’d argue that Meg’s Monster isn’t an RPG at all, but rather a game that walks a fine line between the adventure and visual novel genres with light puzzles sprinkled in. It also has humour and heart in equal measure, making for a perfect little game to devote a weekend to.
Meg’s Monster begins with the titular Meg waking up in a trash heap in the underworld. She soon meets two monsters, Golan and Roy. Golan is quite happy that a child-sized snack waltzed up to them. Roy, on the other hand, has eyes only for an oily substance known as Magic Tar. However, as Golan goes to gobble up Meg, they soon find out her cries trigger an apocalypse. Golan convinces the reluctant and nearly indestructible Roy to keep her safe as they try to find her mom by smuggling her out of the underworld.

Edios Interactive is warning that Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy: Cloud Version is being temporarily delisted from the Switch eShop starting on February 27, 2023 at 10:59pm EST. Wow, that's really short notice. This is due to a "publisher transition," and it's expected to be back up on April 1, 2023.
The announcement goes on to say that if you already own the game, you will be able to continue to play uninterrupted while the transition takes place. However, if you've deleted the game, they recommend that you re-download and archive it to ensure that you can still access it.

This isn't super-great for anyone who was holding off on purchasing the game on Switch, but it's not the most profoundly bad news. A little more warning would have been nice, but at least the publishers are being upfront about how long the downtime is expected to bad, and if you already own it you won't have your access to it disrupted. I can't really editorialize beyond that, since I definitely don't have a horse in this race.
To reiterate, you have until 10:59pm EST tonight to purchase Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy: Cloud Version. If you miss that window, you'll have to wait until April 1, 2023.

Here's some fun news to kick off the week, (well, for me at least), as Forever Entertainment has announced a release date for the returning franchise Magical Drop — The sixth installment in the fast-paced puzzle series will launch on PC and Nintendo Switch on April 25.
As we have previously reported, Magical Drop is a long-running series of tile-based puzzlers that was birthed in the arcade market way back in 1995. One or two players fight it out as one of a number of cute anime avatars, all based on the Tarot, in a breathless battle to group together colored orbs and dispatch them onto your opponent's playfield.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndKF-bUxFv4&ab_channel=ForeverEntertainment
The goal of this simple-to-learn, hard-to-master gameplay is to set up your own playfield several moves ahead of time, so that the cascading globes will trigger a chain reaction of color groupings, inundating your opponent with extra orbs. (In fact, in Japan, the series is actually titled Chain Reaction.)
While there have been several Magical Drop sequels, the series has been on hiatus since 2012, when a Steam-released Magical Drop V proved to be a disaster — packed with bugs, threadbare on content, and ultimately pulled from sale. Forever Entertainment is clearly hoping to resurrect the franchise with this new release, which will feature six different single-player modes (including Story, Survival, and the mini-game filled "Path of Destiny"), as well as support for online and offline vs. battles.
Magical Drop VI launches on PC and Nintendo Switch April 25. PlayStation and Xbox editions will follow at a later date.

The overarching Walking Wake/Iron Leaves events are already live, and will run through March 12, 2023, and the ability to earn these creatures "through other means" is vaguely teased for the future.
These event raids are exclusive to each version (Walking Wake with Scarlet) and Iron Leaves with (Violet), but you can cross over into each raid through online play.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You're sure of a big surprise
Developer Endnight Games launched its survival horror sequel Sons of the Forest on Steam Early Access last week, with the creepy cannibal battler seeing a sensational launch period, having raked in some two million purchases within the first 24 hours of release.
"Thanks to those who have joined us in our Early Access journey into Sons Of The Forest," reads a message posted to the official Endnight Games Twitter. "We have sold over 2 million copies in the first 24 hours, and are very excited for what we have in store for players in the coming weeks."
https://twitter.com/EndNightGame/status/1629252004156682240?s=20
The survivalist adventure, which tasks the player with crafting a habitat for themselves on an isolated island seemingly occupied by a horde of people eaters, (not of the purple persuasion), finally launched in Early Access following a long and turbulent development period, which saw the game miss its initial release windows of May 2022 and then October 2022. These days have clearly not dissuaded the player community, however, who came out in droves on launch day to dive into the nightmarish adventure.
Sons of the Forest is the sequel to the cult 2014 release The Forest, which managed to build a dedicated player base through its regular appearance on social media, Twitch, and other streaming services. With such an incredible launch already tucked into its toolbelt, it's easy to imagine that the sequel is set to become equally, and likely even more, successful.
Sons of the Forest is available now on Steam Early Access. No console editions have been announced.

Both Pokemon can only be obtained via this event, which will run until March 12.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The space adventure gets a special collection
Obsidian's outer-space RPG The Outer Worlds is getting a special edition for newer consoles and PC. The Outer Worlds: Spacer's Choice Edition arrives on March 7, 2023 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.
Given that this version is heading to newer consoles, it'll have a few more bells and whistles compared to the original Outer Worlds. Higher resolution graphics and improved performance, enhanced details, dynamic weather, overhauled lighting, and more all await.
And for those who missed the extra story post-launch, Spacer's Choice links all that in too. The Outer Worlds: Spacer's Choice Edition will have both DLC packs, Murder on Eridanos and Peril on Gorgon, included in the package. The new version will retail for $59.99 by itself, though if you own the game on a previous system (PS4, Xbox One) or on the same PC storefront, you can upgrade to this version for $9.99.
For those looking to keep their adventure going, though, you'll have to stay on the original platform. A Private Division spokesperson confirmed to us that saves will not transfer over to The Outer Worlds: Spacer's Choice Edition.

It's Spacer's Choice
It's a bit of a surprise to see The Outer Worlds get a bumped-up option for the newer consoles, but likely a welcome one for those who missed this game the first time around. Obsidian's space adventure was certainly a little messy at times, but had some worlds and characters that made a decent impact.
With a new sequel in the works, this does seem like a decent excuse to either refresh yourself or get up-to-speed with The Outer Worlds. Or heck, even if you just need a space-centered RPG to tide you over for whenever Starfield arrives.
The Outer Worlds: Spacer's Choice Edition arrives for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S on March 7.

During last week's State of Play presentation, we finally, FINALLY got our first look at combatant Cammy White, who will once again be spinning up a storm in Capcom's upcoming scrapper Street Fighter 6. Fans had been eagerly anticipating Street Fighter veteran's trailer from as far back as Summer 2022, and the British special forces agent certainly proved well worth the wait.
Cammy made her debut in 1993's smash hit Super Street Fighter II, becoming the second woman to be part of the iconic fighting game's roster. Hailing from England, Cammy fast became one of the most popular characters in the Street Fighter universe, only bringing more and more fans into the flock with each subsequent appearance.

Another Pokémon Presents showcase has come and gone, with new announcements including DLC for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, a collaboration between Pokémon and Netflix in the form of Pokémon Concierge, the re-emergence of Pokémon Sleep, and more.
We'll be honest, it wasn't quite the knockout showcase we were hoping for here at Nintendo Life. With the prior announcements that Pokémon Stadium and Pokémon Trading Card Game would be coming to Nintendo Switch Online, we were perhaps looking to be surprised with some release dates or — dare we say it — shadow drops.

This new animated series is the first collaborative production between Netflix and The Pokémon Company and features a decidedly different direction from previous animated adventures in the Pokémon universe. 
The narrative, which is told through stop-motion animation from Dwarf Studios, stars Haru. a concierge a the Pokémon Resort, and Psyduck. The stories that unfold center around her interactions with the various Pokémon that pass through the resort. 
"Netflix is looking forward to delighting fans in Japan and around the world with Pokémon Concierge, an entirely new visual and storytelling experience featuring groundbreaking stop-motion animation set in the Pokémon world in close collaboration with The Pokémon Company," vice president of Netflix content in Asia Minyoung Kim said in a press release. "We're also excited to reveal this new series on Pokémon Day and provide fans with even more things to look forward to on this special holiday celebrating the popular franchise."
Ever since spring 2020, Netflix has been the exclusive home to the Pokémon anime in the United States. While those seasons have continued the story of Ash Ketchum and Pikachu, Pokémon Concierge represents a completely new focus within the world of Pokémon.
We don't know much more about this new series, but we did receive a teaser trailer, which you can see below.]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-02-24T18:11:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo has confirmed that it will not participate in E3 this year. This comes in the wake of a recent report stating the three console makers plan to skip the annual event entirely this year. Sony and Microsoft have yet to confirm any formal attendance. 
In a statement to IGN, Nintendo say E3 didn’t fit into its plans but will continue to support the event alongside its organizer, the ESA. 
"We approach our involvement in any event on a case-by-case basis and are always considering various ways to engage with our fans. Since this year’s E3 show didn’t fit into our plans, we have made the decision to not participate. However, we have been and continue to be a strong supporter of the ESA and E3."
Although Nintendo was the first of the three console makers to stop holding live E3 press conferences in favor of pre-recorded Direct videos, it was also the last one to have a booth on the show floor. Up until the last traditional show in 2019, Nintendo still had a large, often elaborate area filled with demos and a stage where it broadcasted its Treehouse Live stream. Xbox moved its booth out of the convention center to the Microsoft Theater next door in 2018 (though it was still part of E3); PlayStation pulled out of the event entirely in 2019 and hasn't returned. 
E3 2023 is being organized by ReedPop, the company responsible for overseeing PAX and Star Wars Celebration. It will be the first in-person show since the 2019 edition and only the second to take place since the COVID-19 pandemic started (the 2020 and 2022 shows were completely canceled, while 2021 was a virtual event). E3 runs from June 13-16 at the Los Angeles Convention Center and will have dedicated attendance days for industry and fans. The show has no exhibitor list yet, but Ubisoft recently confirmed it will attend E3 if it happens. Xbox head Phil Spencer has expressed support for E3's success but also alluded to Microsoft holding a separate event around the same time in Los Angeles.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mortal Kombat 12 is apparently launching this year, and that news was revealed rather unceremoniously in an earnings call with Warner Bros. Discovery.
In a clip pulled from Warner Bros. Discovery's fourth quarter 2022 earnings call yesterday, Warner Bros. president and CEO David Zaslav states that “...there’s lots more to come, including the highly anticipated Mortal Kombat 12 and Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League, games also set for release this year with ambitious launch projections.” You can watch the clip in the embedded tweet below.

Developer Netherrealm Studios has yet to announce anything on its end. Yesterday, studio head and Mortal Kombat co-creator Ed Boon cheekily tweeted, “so who has heard the news about Injustice 3?”  referencing the fact that for years, Netherrealm has released an Injustice game between Mortal Kombat entries, so technically, that would be next if it maintained that pattern. 
So who has heard the news about INJUSTICE 3 ?
February 23, 2023
Fans will have to wait for a flashier reveal, but a Mortal Kombat 12 launch would be huge for a year that already has Street Fighter 6 and potentially Tekken 8 on the schedule. Last October, Neththerrealm revealed Mortal Kombat: Onslaught, a role-playing mobile game also slated to release this year. 
Mortal Kombat 11 launched in 2019 to positive reviews (here’s ours). A story expansion called Aftermath arrived in 2020.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today’s Sony State of Play included a new trailer for Street Fighter 6, which served to introduce three characters joining the roster – the last ones we should expect to join the launch game line-up.
The arrival of Zangief, the professional wrestler, comes as little surprise, since he’s been a part of the line-up for so long. He holds onto old standby moves like his Screw Piledriver, but gets some new moves on display in the trailer, like the Tundra Storm counter throw.
Likewise, it seemed only a matter of time before Cammy was revealed. We learned that the Heavy version of three of her signature moves – the Spiral Arrow, Cannon Spike, and Hooligan Combination – are being enhanced to “allow a delay which results in altered properties for some big damage,” according to a press release that went out concurrent with the trailer.
Lily is the one new addition to the fighting roster. She’s a descendant of the Thunderfoot tribe, the same cultural group that produced T. Hawk, a fighter who appeared in Super Street Fighter II. Lily’s a smaller fighter who appears to regularly speak to the spirits of nature. Her moveset includes titles like Condor Dive, Condor Spire, and Tomahawk Buster, and she pulls out war clubs to inflict damage in her attacks.
Street Fighter 6 is headed for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, and PC on June 2.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's that time of year again: today was Sony's first State of Play of 2023. While it showcased many indie games and an extended look at Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, the presentation started with a look at five new games coming to the recently released PlayStation VR2 headset. If you missed the live stream, here's a refresher.
  



      
												
Foglands
Described on the PlayStation Blog as a "western sci-fi roguelike," Foglands was the first game shown at the livestream today. Developed by an indie studio called Well Told, the game has you fighting monsters, grabbing loot, and trying to escape from danger before you're swallowed by the Fog. Foglands releases later this year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony showed a new trailer for Resident Evil 4 at the most recent State of Play live stream, and it's great. Now, the trailer is below the next paragraph, and I know you want to skip right into watching it. Which you should. However, let me give you the quick hits.
Luis is present in way more of the game now – he's shown with Leon in the minecart section (also we see the minecart section) – we get a brief look at the Krauser fight, more detailed views of combat, the late section of the game that goes full Call of Duty (which is and has always been good), some brief glimpses of Ashley's sections, and a tease for Mercenaries. Okay, the trailer is below. There's a lot more I didn't type out because you aren't reading this, and I do not blame you. Have fun, friends. The game looks great.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Accompanied by a somber cover of Radiohead’s “Karma Police,” Bungie rolled out a new look at Lightfall during today’s Sony State of Play presentation, and shared the expansion's launch trailer.
In this latest trailer, we get several new glimpses of the narrative that lies ahead in the expansion. If the trailer is any indication, we’re heading into a pretty bleak moment for the characters we’ve been following in this universe since 2014. Across the course of the trailer, we see the approach of The Witness, as it methodically seems to tear through Earth’s defenses and demoralize its defenders.
It’s no surprise that things are looking especially dire. In the long-running storyline of the Desinty universe, Lightfall is set to be the penultimate storytelling chapter of the current saga, ahead of next year’s The Final Shape. It won’t be a tremendous surprise if the events of Lightfall set up a seemingly insurmountable dilemma for humanity that can only be resolved with the story arc’s conclusion next year.
We won’t have long to wait to see the scope and direction of Lightfall’s narrative; the expansion is set to release next week, on February 28.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony’s PlayStation VR2 launched recently with only a handful of proper exclusives. Horizon Call of the Mountain is the big showcase piece for the hardware, and Gran Turismo 7 has been updated to include impressive VR modes. Outside of those first-party games, however, the launch library is mostly made of previously released VR games. The one other major exception is from Capcom, which has made Resident Evil Village playable entirely in PlayStation VR2 with a free update.
Resident Evil 7 received a similar PlayStation VR port in 2017, but I found playing that game in VR underwhelming. It was released early in the VR lifecycle when the basic mechanics of the new platform were still being worked out, and you had to play with a controller. It wasn’t ideal.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tango Gameworks’ founder Shinji Mikami is departing the studio in the coming months after a 12-year tenure. The news was first broken by TrueAchievements, who received and verified a company-wide email to ZeniMax staff announcing the departure before Bethesda publicly confirmed the news on Twitter.
Bethesda’s statement, posted below, doesn't cite a reason or a departure date but thanks Mikami for his tenure at the studio: 
Mikami is credited as the creator of Resident Evil, directing several entries during his long tenure at Capcom, where he also worked on titles such as Dino Crisis, Devil May Cry, and Phoenix Wright. Mikami co-founded Capcom’s Clover Studio in 2004, the team behind Okami, Viewtiful Joe, and God Hand (which he directed), but he departed the publisher after Clover’s closure in 2007. He and former Clover leads would establish Platinum Games later that year, where he directed Vanquish. After leaving Platinum, Mikami founded Tango Gameworks in 2010, which was acquired by ZeniMax the same year. He directed the studio’s first title, The Evil Within, and served as executive producer on its sequel and Tango’s subsequent games, Ghostwire: Tokyo and this year’s Hi-Fi Rush.
It's unclear what Mikami will do next, but he's leaving Tango in a good place for the future. Hi-Fi Rush, the colorful musical action game that surprise launched in late January, was spearheaded by John Johanas, director of The Evil Within 2, and a team of younger designers. It had perhaps the strongest critical reception of Tango's portfolio thus far, with some calling it an early Game of the Year contender (here's our positive review). Mikami has seemingly done a good job fostering fresh talent and new ideas at Tango before his departure, and we're excited to see what's next for the veteran designer.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlayStation VR2 launches today, and the new VR version of Resident Evil Village alongside it. However, fans have wondered about the status of the previously announced PS VR2 port of the upcoming Resident Evil 4 remake that was briefly teased last year. Capcom has finally broken its silence with a small update.
In a press release, Capcom states that development has officially begun on Resident Evil 4’s VR mode. Additionally, this update will be released as free DLC. Unfortunately, Capcom doesn’t provide a release window, but if the studio has only now commenced serious work on the mode with RE4 a month away from launch, it seems unlikely that PS VR2 owners will be gunning down Ganados in their headsets on day one. We'll just have to wait and see. 
Resident Evil 4 launches on March 24 and is Game Informer’s cover story this month. Be sure to visit our coverage hub to find a month’s worth of exclusive features and videos dissecting the anticipated remake.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fans of Castlevania, namely the Koji Igarashi-led titles such as Symphony of the Night, may want to keep an eye on Grim Guardians: Demon Purge. The game comes from Azure Strike Gunvolt developer Inti Creates and stars two demon-slaying sisters who must scale a monster-laden castle to rescue their high-school from destruction.
Each sister sports a unique playstyle. Shinobu fires a gun making her suited for long-ranged attacks, while Maya cuts down targets with close-ranged melee assaults. The game features two-player co-op, but playing alone lets you swap between sisters on-the-fly, each with their own health bar. This creates a unique form of strategy that we showcase in our gameplay footage below. Watch Marcus Stewart and Wesley LeBlanc explore Grim Guardian: Demon Purge's fiendish offerings to find out if it has the potential to be a worthy Castlevania successor.

After more than half a decade in development, Atomic Heart has arrived as the first title from developer Mundfish. This BioShock-inspired shooter is an impressive debut in many ways, and it wears its influences on its sleeve – for better and worse. The game’s dazzling world design, extraordinary production values, and fast-paced fights make for a solid campaign, but the derivative plot and often painful writing insist on dragging it down.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pokémon Presents returns Monday, February 27, with 20 minutes of Pokémon news celebrating Pokémon Day 2023. 
The official Pokémon Twitter account announced this today, with a short 15-second video hyping up the presentation. There's not too much to glean from the video, but it does feature the main theme from Pokémon Red and Blue. Since the reveal earlier this month that Game Boy and Game Boy Advance games are playable on Switch via Nintendo Switch Online, fans have speculated that older Pokémon games like Red, Blue, Yellow, Gold, Silver, Crystal, and even Ruby, Sapphire, and Emerald could appear on the service one day. Perhaps that's an announcement we'll be getting this Sunday. 
The next #PokemonPresents is on the way, Trainers! 🤩
#PokemonDay 2023! 🎉

February 21, 2023
With the presentation lasting 20 minutes, there's plenty of time for an announcement like that and more. And in recent years, the Pokémon Day direct-style presentation has been quite stellar. Last year during the Pokémon Day stream, Pokémon Scarlet and Violet were announced alongside a big Pokémon Legends: Arceus update, a Pokémon Brillaint Diamond and Shining Pearl mystery gift (Shaymin), the Alola update for Pokémon GO, and other announcements for games like Pokémon Unite, Pokémon Masters EX, and Pokémon Cafe Remix. The Pokémon Company event announced a new online anime, too. 
Only time will tell if this year's Presents features as many exciting announcements. Fortunately, we don't have to wait long because Pokémon Day is Monday, February 27. The Pokémon Presents begins at 6 a.m. PT/9 a.m. ET and will run about 20 minutes. 
In the meantime, read Game Informer's Pokémon Scarlet and Violet review and then read our review of Pokémon Legends: Arceus.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft has signed a binding 10-year legal agreement with Nintendo to bring Call of Duty to Nintendo players, presuming the company's colossal $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard is approved. 
Since the acquisition announcement last year, Microsoft has been attempting to prove to government agencies like the U.S.' Federal Trade Commission that this acquisition does not fall into any monopolistic activity and would not harm competitors like PlayStation. However, Microsoft has had a bit of a rough go at it. To counter, though, the company has been proactive in attempting to get the greenlight from the FTC, going as far as promising PlayStation that Call of Duty games will continue to come to Sony's consoles and agreeing to bring Call of Duty to Nintendo hardware. 
Now, Microsoft president and vice chair Brad Smith has announced on Twitter that Microsoft has formally signed a legally binding 10-year agreement with Nintendo to bring Call of Duty games to Nintendo players. Here's the statement Smith released on behalf of Microsoft, in full: 
We’ve now signed a binding 10-year contract to bring Xbox games to Nintendo’s gamers. This is just part of our commitment to bring Xbox games and Activision titles like Call of Duty to more players on more platforms. pic.twitter.com/JmO0hzw1BO
February 21, 2023
Many have already begun to speculate how Activision Blizzard will bring Call of Duty games to Nintendo consoles, which are traditionally much less powerful than current-gen Xbox and PlayStation consoles, with "full feature and content parity." 
If I had to guess, Call of Duty will likely go the route of cloud gaming seen on the Switch, unless Nintendo's next console is set to be a significantly more powerful piece of hardware. Only time will tell. 
In the meantime, read Game Informer's thoughts on the latest Call of Duty in our Modern Warfare II review.

Metroid Prime has long been considered one of the crowning achievements of Nintendo’s GameCube library. The series’ seamless transition to the first-person genre was defined by its frenetic action, massively explorable environments, clever puzzles, and daunting boss encounters. However, the subsequent two decades have worn on the original release, but much like Samus by the end of each game, Metroid Prime Remastered brings the title back to full power.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The release of the Pinocchio-inspired Soulslike Lies of P has been narrowed down to this August. A new story trailer introduces a seemingly villainous character, Simon, while highlighting some of the dangerous monstrosities waiting to dismantle players. 
Lies of P unfolds in the fictional, Belle Époque-era French city of Krat as players control Pinocchio, a mechanoid puppet on a quest to become human. A certain Mr. Geppetto might be able to help with that, but Krat has been overtaken by sinister creatures Pinocchio must cut down using his multi-purpose mechanical arm. 


The gameplay takes heavy cues from From Software’s work – Bloodborne in particular – as players take down enemies with deliberate sword attacks, while various mechanical arms grant abilities like firing lightning bolts or a grappling hook to reel in targets. Outside of battles, sidequests present the option of lying to characters, and the truthfulness of your answers alters the direction of these stories. 
Lies of P will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S (including Game Pass), and PC. You can learn more by reading our hands-on preview from last year’s Gamescom.]]></summary>

Akka Arrh is a reimagined version of a prototype Atari arcade machine from the ‘80s. Originally scrapped due to a lack of interest, the trailer for the re-release claims that only three cabinets have ever been seen. 40 years later, when Atari reached out to veteran designer Jeff Minter (Tempest 2000, Polybius) to remake one of its games, he chose Akka Arrh. The result is a reimagining of the original concept, fused with Minter’s signature psychedelic visuals and some modern-day improvements. While the game can…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Have you ever wanted to explore new realities and compelling narratives but need that initial push? For those who wish to try something new, the developers of Dyschronia: Chronos Alternate at MyDearest want to help you with a chance to win your choice of a PlayStation 5 Digital Edition, a Nintendo Switch OLED, or a Meta Quest 2 (128 GB).
Dyschronia: Chronos Alternate takes place in the city of Astrum Close where the crime rate is only 0.001%. Protagonist Hal Scion is a young investigator who possesses a special ability called “Memory Dive” that allows him to see into and alter the past and he uses this ability to collect evidence for investigations. When the founder of Astrum Close is found dead, Hal must take up the case in order to solve this theoretically “impossible” murder. The game is currently available on the Meta Quest 2, is launching on PlayStation VR2 on February 22nd, and launches on Nintendo Switch later this year.
One lucky winner can choose between a PlayStation 5 Digital Edition, a Nintendo Switch OLED, or a Meta Quest 2 (128 GB) to jumpstart their journey into the cyber-noir anime world of Dyschronia: Chronos Alternate.
Sweepstakes open to residents of the continental U.S. and District of Columbia ages 17 and older. Daily entry is available until 11:59 PM CST, February 26, 2023. You will be contacted via email after the close of the sweepstakes so be sure to use an email you check frequently. Full sweepstakes rules available below. Good Luck!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Breaking news: OpenTTD 13.0 is now available! Depending on your perspective, we’re either two months early for our usual April 1st release, or a bit tardy for the Christmas 2022 release we intended. We think the wait has been worth it. This is one of the largest releases we’ve done in several years, with numerous features and improvements covering the user interface, gameplay features, and modding extensions for NewGRF and Game Script creators. Some of the highlights are: Variable interface scaling at whatever size you want (not just 2x and 4x), with optional chunky bevels for that retro feel. This includes better automatic scaling when using HiDPI or mixed DPI setups. Direct access to NewGRF/AI/GS settings from the new game window. Various small tweaks and improvements to several windows. NewGRFs can now provide engine variants that are shown hierarchically in the purchase list. Multi-track level crossings to keep road vehicles from stopping in the middle of the crossing. Custom league tables for GameScripts. More natural rivers which get wider as they flow downstream. And much more, which can be seen in the changelog or the previous release announcements! In addition to these features and improvements, we’ve fixed lots of bugs. (If you played with the RC2 testing release, most were fixed before then. See the changelog for full details.)

        <id>https://www.scummvm.org/news/archive/#2023-02-03</id>
        <link href="https://www.scummvm.org/news/20230203/"/>
        <updated>2023-02-03T18:07:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few months have passed since we released ScummVM 2.6.1. It's time to prepare for a new release!
Our lovely developers added support, yet again, for a bunch of new ancient games that require testing:
Soldier Boyz
GLK Scott Adams Interactive Fiction games (C64 and ZX Spectrum)
GLK Scott Adams adventures 1-12 (TI99/4A format)
Obsidian
Pink Panther: Passport to Peril
Pink Panther: Hokus Pokus Pink
Driller/Space Station Oblivion
Halls of the Dead: Faery Tale Adventure II
Besides these games, we’d appreciate it if you could check our release testing list. Maybe you’ll even find your favorite game on there that has been sitting on that shelf for way too long - otherwise, there are some demos of these games available on our website.
And since ScummVM is about playing games in general, we’ve seen notable changes across many, many engines - so this is the perfect time for giving your favorites another go.
As usual, we are not just adding support for new games. We are constantly working on improving the engines we already support and, in particular, we’ve seen some incredible work being done on the SCUMM engine. Yes, there are the usual bug fixes, but this time we are also adding a feature that helps playing the SCUMM games in a truly original fashion: Support for the original loading and saving dialogs within the GUI!
Speaking of truly original: Remember those old CRT displays we had back in the day? With ScummVM 2.7.0 you’ll be able to replicate this experience on certain platforms thanks to our new shader-based scalers. Go ahead and give it a try!
All testing must be done with stable builds, not development ones. Please report any bugs or oddities on our issue tracker.
A detailed list of all exciting new features and fixes is available in our NEWS file.
Thank you very much for your support! Let’s make ScummVM 2.7.0 a great release - together!
