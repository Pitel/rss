        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know as much about programming video game monsters as I do the exact flavour and consistency of the sands on Mars, but I've always thought the chief advantage of the Slime monster archetype is its economy. A slime, in most games, is a squashy smiley face. Why, I could grow myself one of those right this very instant, by doodling a circle in MS Paint and squinting very hard. Slimes do take more complex forms - chrome slimes, fire slimes, slimes with angry eyebrows, etc - but come now, it's not on the same level as rebooting Lara Croft's hair to billow in the blowback from grenades.
The simplicity of slime creation may soon become a distant memory, however, for Epic Games tech artist and current Duck Shake Games Asher Zhu is hell-bent on reinventing the homely Dragon Quest sludgeball as a technical tour de force on par with his previous contributions to Unreal Engine showcase Matrix Awakens. That's the impression I garner from the below video of Zhu's latest project, anyway, whose description also tantalises with talk of "Splatoon mechanics in dungeons".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apex Legends features crossplay, allowing you to play with your friends on Xbox, PlayStation, PC, and even Nintendo Switch, regardless of which platform you are on. This lets players engage in Apex Legends with more of their friends, and it also reduces the time for match queues, which can be a problem on certain servers that are not as populated as others.


The crossplay feature is on by default in Apex Legends, so you’ll have to disable it yourself if you wish to play with and against players on the same platform as yours. While it is possible to turn off crossplay on consoles such as Xbox, PlayStation, and Switch, Respawn Entertainment does not allow players to turn off crossplay on PC.


Here is how to disable crossplay in Apex Legends on Xbox, PlayStation, and Nintendo Switch:



Start Apex Legends.


In the lobby, open the Game Menu by either choosing the cogwheel icon at the bottom-right corner of the screen or pressing the Options button on Xbox and Playstation, or the + button on Nintendo Switch.


Select Settings.


Navigate below to Cross Platform Play.


Select the ‘Disabled’ option to stop crossplay. You can choose ‘Enabled’ to turn on crossplay again.



Image via Respawn Entertainment


Keep in mind that even if crossplay is disabled on your console, if you are queuing up for a match with any PC player, the crossplay will be enabled for those matches.


Players on a console can avoid queuing up with PC players as there may be a mismatch between players who are using a controller and those who play with a mouse and keyboard. However, with Apex Legends in particular, players on PC often complain about aim assist, which is a slight assistance given to players for aiming when using a controller to play Apex Legends.

Football is something of a hot topic at the moment (we have been reliably informed), so it seems only fitting that the folks over at EA Sports have seized the opportunity to share news about FC 25, which will score its full reveal trailer tomorrow (17th July).
This trailer will premiere on the EA Sports FC YouTube channel at the rather unusual time of 16:57 BST / 17:57 CET / 08:57 PT. The premiere's description seems to suggest that "Everything For the Club" will be this year's tagline — it sounds suitably forgettable, eh?

According to the lore revealed during Dawntrail, The Arcadion is where fighters test their mettle against one another for glory and riches. It's a similar concept to the Coliseum in Ul'dah, though possibly more MMA than Gladitorial combat. We saw The Arcadion spring to life in a post-credit scene once the Dawntrail MSQ was done and dusted, and were introduced to a mysterious mustachioed Lalafell, but we've not been able to enter until now.

However, before you can play, there's going to be some server downtime. 


No Destiny 2 update goes live without at least a little server maintenance and downtime. It's just a part of the game because it's always online, and developer Bungie needs some way to be able to add new files to it without players getting in the way. You won't be able to play during this downtime, but it should be short if Bungie's notes are to be believed. I wouldn't hold my breath, though, because the launch of The Final Shape wasn't exactly smooth.

It’s a first person pilot-em-up that puts you in the cockpit of a grasshoppery rust-bucket carrying out a critical mission on an industrial desert planet. The more the intro text stresses the importance of this mission, the more guiltily useless I feel, because I cannot get this beautifully run-down mech to do anything of note, unless you count violently hopping into walls to be notable.

Although the Switch is home to an abundance of arcade-style racing games, the same can’t be said for more realistic fare.
This is most likely because the Switch’s hardware would struggle to handle the Gran Turismos and Forza Motorsports of this world, so developers tend to give Nintendo's system a miss when making their own serious racers. Besides, let’s face it, on the odd occasion the Switch has received a port of a racing sim, the results usually leave something to be desired – case in point, the chonky visuals that were being churned out in the WRC games for years.

Anime Defenders Unit Tier List for Update 4


We've put together this Anime Defenders Unit Tier List specifically for the Update 4 changes due to the balance adjustments. This Tier List includes every unit available in Anime Defenders Update 4. Units in the S Tier are extremely powerful and considered the best units in the entire game. You want to aim to get all or most of these over time. Those in the A Tier are still solid options but may be overshadowed by an S Tier unit with similar specialties. Our units in the B Tier will have specific scenarios in which they shine and may get the job done in most cases, but overall you'll want to replace them with A Tier units or better. Finally, units in the C Tier are a bit under tuned at the moment and should be replaced as soon as possible. Here is our Anime Defenders Tier List for all Units as of Update 4:


S Tier



Admiral of Light


Bear King


Bloomer


Chief of Lava


Clay


Cursed SOrcerer


Donut Warrior


Flame Dragon King


Legion Commander


Legion Assassin


Pink Demon Witch

Shinobi Form 3


Slime Spirit


Strongest Swordsman


Thunder Hokage



A Tier



Ascended Qi Master

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Due to the overwhelming number of Roblox players, the servers can experience problems from time to time. One, in particular, is error code 769, which can prohibit you from playing a specific game. We're here to explain error code 769 in Roblox and how to fix it.


What does Roblox error code 769 mean?


Roblox error code 769, while it can be frustrating, is not uncommon. It can occur when the game doesn't have suitable administrator privileges or the servers are down. More specifically, it can happen when trying to teleport to another location.


How to fix Roblox error code 769


If you're on PC, right-click on the Roblox file and select 'Run as administrator.' This feature should help clear out the problems unless the servers are down.


In most cases, Roblox error code 769 is tied to a server issue. Check out the game's server status page or Down Detector to get the latest reports. Those who see a spike in problems will likely need to wait until the servers function better. One update was implemented for the teleportation problems on July 1, 2024. However, the error code seems to still appear when the servers are overloaded.

While waiting for the next update, there are proactive steps you can take to resolve the issue. Ensure your internet connection is stable, and check for new patches that may need to be downloaded. Keep in mind that the error code may not be a problem on your end, so just sit tight until the Roblox team figures the situation out. For more help, be sure to check out our guide on how to fix error code 264.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's time to wax on and wax off to improve your beat 'em up skills, as The Karate Kid: Street Rumble kicks its way onto the PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC on September 20, 2024. This retro-style brawler relives the original movie trilogies' sights and sounds in pixel style.


This beat 'em up, like TMNT: Shredder's Revenge and the upcoming Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Rita's Rewind has some gorgeous 16-bit graphics. Fittingly, it will also have a chiptune soundtrack. 




The Karate Kid: Street Rumble will feature 12 levels with up to four-player local co-op. You can play as Daniel Russo, Mr. Miyagi, Kumiko, and Ali Mills. The confirmed bosses that will challenge you along the way include Johnny Lawrence, John Kreese, and Terry Silver, among others. Hopefully, fear does not exist in your game room. 


Confirmed levels for this game so far include Topanga Beach, West Valley High, Cobra Kai Dojo, and the All-Valley Tournament. We'll be venturing into Okinawa as well. 


Something to keep in mind is this is coming from publisher GameMill Entertainment, which doesn't have the best track record. The last adaptation from this franchise Cobra Kai 2: Dojos Rising, currently has a 41% rating on Steam from a meager 41 user reviews.

The Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl series from GameMill Entertainment is fairly decent, however. "Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2 is worth trying out," said our review.


The Karate Kid: Street Rumble is targeting September 20 for PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC.

How to check the server status for an outage in Roblox


If you suspect that Roblox may be having server issues, you can visit their official status page on status.roblox.com.


Here, it’ll break down the server’s current status based on each platform. If everything says Operational, things should be fine. What you should be paying attention to is at the top where it’ll tell you if there’s an “Active Incident”. 


There will also be a breakdown of what kind of incident is going on and which platforms are currently affected.


As of July 15, 2024, early noon PST, the game seems to be having a server thumbnail issue going on. The team has been monitoring and is now in the Investigating phase of fixing the problem. Hang tight and check this page periodically if things change. 


Additionally, you can check social media to see if other players are experiencing the same issues as you. They may use hashtags like #Roblox and #RobloxDown.

How to fix Roblox server issues


When the Roblox servers are fixed on their end, you may want to restart your game, check for any updates, and make sure you have a steady internet connection. 


Should problems still persist and everything is fine on your end, all you can do is wait until the server-side issues on Roblox are fully resolved.

This isn't unexpected, given the immense hype surrounding the title. While the full release takes place on July 19, those who purchased the Deluxe Edition can jump in today. Unfortunately, the servers seem to be hitting some snags in handling all the early interest.


"EA Servers are not available" error in College Football 25


This error won't be a stranger to those who have previously played other sports titles from EA Sports. EA FC 24's launch had similar issues in September last year. If you're getting the "EA Servers are not available" error, it simply means that your console can't connect to the official servers.

Unfortunately, this annoying error prevents players from connecting to Roblox and being able to play. Here is how to fix Error Code 264 in Roblox so you can get back to playing.

Error Code 264 Roblox fix


If you are experiencing Error Code 264 in Roblox on July 15, 2024,  it's important to note there is currently and ongoing server outage with Roblox that is triggering this error to appear. However, Error Code 264 in Roblox usually means that you're already loaded into another game world or session on that Roblox account and therefore cannot join the session you are trying to join.


Here are some things you can try to fix the Error Code 264 in Roblox:



Check the official Roblox Status page to ensure the servers are not still undergoing issues. If they are, simply wait a little bit before trying again.


Make sure your Roblox game files are on the latest version. Simply close Roblox and restart it to force a check for an update.


Double-check your own connection. Check with your ISP to make sure there is no current outage. If you are on a WiFi connection, consider switching to a more stable wired connection.


Try another game temporarily. If you are positive that servers are not having issues, try joining another game or session to see if that kicks you out of the previous one, thus fixing Error Code 264 when you try to join a new one.



These server-related issues seem to plague Roblox servers every couple of months or so, and are usually resolved within an hour or so. As such, if you've tried all the above fixes and are still having trouble connecting in Roblox, I'd recommend trying again in 30 minutes or so.

If you don't want to buy Freyna with real money, you'll need to grind for four of her components. These are found across the Vespers and Sterile Land regions as rewards from certain missions. For the first three components, you can find their location and the drop chances below:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Among the myriad titles waiting to be conquered in Roblox's Blox Fruits, the Raging Demon stands out as a pinnacle of achievement, known for its unique challenges and exclusivity. We're here to guide you through the journey of earning this prestigious title, offering tips and tricks to make the path a little less daunting.


How to unlock Raging Demon title in Blox Fruits


Players can earn the Raging Demon title by getting 20 player kills in the same server without dying. Your targets must also have a Bounty or Honor on them to count towards the achievement. Otherwise, you'll unlock the Apex Predator instead, which involves defeating 25 players without the Bounty or Honor requirement.


If you're a newcomer to Blox Fruits, you won't be able to access the title until much later. The Title Specialist, a character in the game, can only be found in the Second or Third Seas. These locations can be unlocked after reaching Level 700 or higher. But even with these ranks, you'll still need to improve your character's performance to survive long enough in PvP.

Players may need to reach the max level cap level of 2,550 for better chances. It would help if you also took advantage of the fruit powers to reign supreme on the battlefield. Check out our fruits tier list to see which ones are best.


Other than fruit, you can set up your build with top-tier weapons and fighting styles. The Legendary Sword Dealer offers some of the best tools to use, boosting your performance substantially. Additionally, fighting styles like Electric Claw or Godhuman can benefit your strategy.


Remember, gaining the Raging Demon title in Blox Fruits is not an overnight feat. It requires time, practice, and a lot of patience. If you're just starting out, it's best to save this goal for the later stages of the game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gems are the primary currency of Brawl Stars, offering players exclusive content like Mega Boxes and new fighters. However, most features come at a hefty cost, so it's crucial to farm Gems as much as possible. To help with this, we'll show you a few ways to earn Gems for free in Brawl Stars.


Brawl Stars free Gems farming guide


You can get Gems for free in Brawl Stars with the following methods:



Earned in the Battle Pass


Claimable on Supercell Store via Quests


Special events 



If you earn enough Battle Pass XP, you'll get to unlock Gems from various tiers. Players can boost their progression from Daily XP, quests, or playing multiple rounds. The free Battle Pass typically features several 10 Gems packs, but you'll need to gather up a ton of points to reach the higher ranks.


Screenshot by Destructoid


In addition to the Battle Pass, the Supercell Store provides free Gems based on quest completion rates. Log into your Brawl Stars account on the Supercell page, then look down for the Store Bonuses. You may have already completed some quests, allowing you to claim 10 Gems for free as the first reward. 


Screenshot via Supercell Store page


If you don't see any claimable rewards, select the 'Quests' section to see what tasks must be completed. The objectives shown here are relatively straightforward, including logging in for a consecutive amount of days or winning battles. Achieve these tasks to earn points for the Bonuses hub. For instance, 750 points offer 25 Gems, one of the most significant free packs.


While it may require some patience, participating in special events is one of the last options. These celebrations often reward players with free Gems in Brawl Stars, such as the Mega Box gifts from the Classic Brawl. To keep track of these events, stay updated on Brawl Stars' schedule by following their page on Twitter/X.

Aside from materials, the new version of the Analogue Pocket is functionally the same as their plastic counterparts. It appears as though it’s compatible with all the accessories. However, it’s made of sterner stuff. Solid billet 6061 aluminum, to be exact. Whatever that is. It's metal and it plays Game Boy games; that's the important part.


What will most likely give you pause is the $499 price tag. That’s more than twice the price of a standard-issue model, which is already quite the luxury purchase. To be fair, Analogue’s FPGA consoles are targeting t…]]></summary>

FreakZone Games has announced that the popular high-speed indie platformer Spark the Electric Jester 3 is coming to Nintendo Switch on 25th July in North America, and 1st August in Europe and Australia.
Inspired by the Sonic Adventure games, Spark the Electric Jester 3 sees the return of the titular hero in the leading role. The game launched on Steam in 2022 and simply reading through reader reviews is enough to make us giddy. "This is basically the Sonic Adventure 3 we never got" says one fan, while another says it's "everything I wished from 3D sonic games". High praise indeed.

Squads in Valorant may have that one player who might be carrying them through rounds, but winning matches in Valorant requires the entire team to work together.


To achieve this, players need to communicate throughout a match in Valorant to have a better chance at winning matches. New players in Valorant can find it probably a bit too overwhelming when they match up with strangers online who are calling out shots, enemies and potential plays using phrases they might not understand.


So, to help players make sense of some of the most common terminology in Valorant, here are some common phrases in Valorant and what they mean:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Xbox’s official website has seemingly revealed the dates for an upcoming Black of Ops 6 open beta. 


As spotted first by CharlieIntel, the website states that the players who pre-order the digital edition of the game or those with “select” Game Pass memberships, can gain early access to the open beta starting on August 30. The Call of Duty Black Ops 6 free Open beta will start on September 6.


Screenshot by Destructoid


Given all the hype around this particular Call of Duty title, it seems like the Xbox website has prematurely revealed the dates. The open beta announcement would have feasibly arrived with a few more theatrics.


How to get early access to Call of Duty Black Ops 6 open beta?


If the dates are more than mere placeholders, then we can expect the Black Ops 6 open beta to kick off from August 30 onwards. To gain early access though, players would have to pre-order the game on Xbox, PlayStation, or PC.


Players can also pre-order the Vault Edition, priced at $99.99 which offers the base game along with the following rewards:



Hunters vs. Hunted Operator Pack


Four Operator Skins: Adler, Park, Brutus and Klaus


Mastercraft Collection


5 Mastercraft Weapons


BlackCell (1 Season)


Battle Pass access


20 Tier Skips in Battle Pass


1,100 CP and more


GobbleGum Pack for Zombies


12 GobbleGums of high rarities



Players will also receive the Woods Operator Pack as a pre-order reward, regardless of which digital edition they purchase. This includes the Classic Woods Operator skin which can be used in Modern Warfare 3, Warzone, and Warzone Mobile. You also unlock the Zombie Woods and Numbers Woods skins with this Operator pack.

Everyone’s school days were a gauntlet of different challenges. From exams to social drama to the occasional run-in with a schoolyard bully, everyone had a bit of a hard time, but spare a thought to the poor headteachers who had to keep a building full of hormonal teenagers from descending into utter chaos. Let’s School from Pathea Games (My Time at Sandrock) gives a nod to these brave individuals and shows just how bogged down in bureaucracy everyone’s headteacher really is. No wonder they always had such a short temper with us.
The gameplay of Let’s School isn’t that different from other management sims like Two Point Campus. You inherit a rundown school from your old headteacher and are tasked with helping it achieve greatness once again. However, where Two Point Campus leans into the whimsy of running an educational institute, Let’s School instead focuses on mundane tasks required to keep both students and staff happy.

A Heartful of Games is developing the game, which retains the stylized Spider-Verse-inspired art direction from the hit film. The story unfolds after the movie's events and sees Leo, Raph, Donny, and Mikey battling a new wave of mutants invading New York City. 


As previously covered in our exclusive preview earlier this year, Mutant Mayhem is a third-person action/platformer game, and each turtle features a unique playstyle. The game also supports up to two-player local co-op. 
TMNT: Mutants Unleashed launches on October 18 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC. The game is also getting a fancy Collector Edition, and you can see the contents of that here. Mutants Unleashed is one of several TMNT games to arrive in recent years (and the third in 2024 alone, following Wrath of the Mutants and the Switch port of Splintered Fate), and you can read all about the franchise’s history in video games in our in-depth retrospective.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I’ve just hopped on my motorbike, enjoying one of several pleasingly incongruent classical musical tracks that plays from the radio, on my way to tick tasks off a list in the top right corner of my screen by scavenging an abandoned hospital. It’s a great hospital, by the way. Spotlight-headed phantasma shamble about corridors reminiscent of The Division 2 or The Last Of Us’s naturalia.
Striking, but also within easy reach of comparisons. And if Once Human was purely the collection of x from ys it very much appears to be, I’m not sure I’d have much positive to say about it. On the surface, what you're getting here is a 6/10 third-person shooter from ten years ago that gleefully spills thumbtacks along any simple paths to progress with live service obfuscation, propped up by a detached crafting and building economy that has you popping mined rocks and chopped wood in the oven then taking out freshly baked shotguns a few minutes later. Its systems run the gamut from numbly enjoyable to being a source of major psychic damage, and even the simple act of replacing your initial tier I rustic baseball cap means navigating several menus, currencies, and resources.

        <updated>2024-07-15T15:40:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mortal Kombat 1’s final Year 1 DLC fighter arrives next week, and it’s Takeda Takahashi. The young Shirai Ryu warrior makes only his second appearance in a Mortal Kombat game and looks every bit as capable as his older clanmates, Scorpion and Smoke. 
Although Takeda was Kenshi’s son in his debut appearance, Mortal Kombat X, the remixed timeline of Mortal Kombt 1 has changed him to Kenshi’s cousin. Like Kenshi, Takeda grew up a Yakuza but was more faithful to the clan than his cousin. As such, the Yakuza tasked Takeda with killing Kenshi, and the two battled, with the latter coming emerging victorious. Takeda was mortally wounded in the battle and rushed to the aid of the Shirai Ryu, where Kenshi protected him from being killed by the Yakuza for failing his mission. This causes Takeda to have a change of heart and join the Shirai Ryu to wage war against Earthrrealm’s criminal underground and, eventually, the evil forces of Outworld. 
Takeda still utilizes the Shirai Ryu fighting style, including his signature pair of bladed whips. He also sports shurikens, a barrage of teleporting flame attacks, and an aerial grapple best described as mid-air corkscrew piledriver. Check Takeda out below.  


Takeda will be available on July 23, both as a standalone purchase and as a free download for Kombat Pack owners. The same day also sees previously revealed Kameo fighter Ferra become available to buy. Both Takeda and Ferra will be playable for the first time during Evo 2025 this weekend.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Crocs and Pokémon are teaming up again for another collaboration, this time bringing four classic Generation 1 pocket monsters into the shoe line sometime this year. This news comes by way of Sole Retriever, which reports that Crocs is releasing four new pairs of shoes, each themed after a specific Kanto Pokémon: Charizard, Gengar, Snorlax, and Jigglypuff. 
Though there isn't a release date for these Crocs yet – Sole Retriever simply reports 2024 – we know each will cost $70. While each pair has unique theming based on the Pokémon it's representing, each pair of Crocs comes with Jibbitz, which are the detachable charms on the tops of the shoes, the classic Pokémon title on back of the shoe strap, and the classic Pokéball logo as the buttons holding each of the straps in place. 
Charizard

Gengar

Snorlax

Jigglypuff

Sole Retriever says these Crocs will be available through Crocs and online and in-store retailers. 
While waiting to learn more, read about an upcoming Nike x Tekken 8 shoe collaboration.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Prepare to die.
Upon booting it up for the very first time, Darkest Dungeon 2 greets you with a message that plainly informs you that you’re going to fail… a lot… while trying to overcome its many challenges. It does this not to discourage you, but to set expectations. Keeping with the precedent set by the first Darkest Dungeon, this sequel is the kind of game that doesn’t pull its punches as you work to achieve mastery over its various systems. Many may be put off by developer Red Hook Studios' uncompromising approach to difficulty, but those who stick it out will find that Darkest Dungeon 2 offers some of the most rewarding experiences one can find in a roguelike RPG adventure. Perhaps most importantly, this new entry also isn’t afraid to try some new things that set it noticeably apart from its predecessor.
Getting its first full release on PC back in May 2023 following 18 months of Early Access, Darkest Dungeon 2 takes place in a grim, Lovecraftian world overrun by all manner of undead creatures and eldritch abominations after an academic named The Scholar messed around with an ancient relic called the Iron Crown. All the horrors stem from a mountain looming ominously in the distance, and you’re thus tasked with assembling a team of four adventurers and using their combat and survival skills to help you carry a flame called Hope aboard a stagecoach to the mountain, where you will confront the source of the evil and hopefully rid the land of it for good.

It's a VR game, which is a break from the norm for White Owls, the studio run by Hidetaka "Swery" Suehiro (then again, what is their "norm"?). It's also got a big multiplayer component, with lots of jovial bubble-popping and chicken-squeezing between the comedy blood spurts. And this taste of multiplayer mischief has Swery's head percolating. This game won't be his last dipped toe in the multiplayer ocean, he told us.
"In the future," said Swery, "I would like to leverage this experience to challenge myself with something new in the online multiplayer realm (something you probably haven't even imagined yet)."

The latest UK Charts are in, and Luigi's Mansion 2 HD maintains its position at number 3, signalling a strong performance from the remaster despite some reservations regarding its price.
In fact, 8 of the top 10 this week are made up of games available on Switch, with only Grand Theft Auto V (shock) and Elden Ring representing competing platforms. Granted, physical sales aren't what they used to be, and we'd need a view of digital sales to get a complete picture of what's going on in the world of game sales right now, but it's still nice to see as the Switch winds down to make way for its successor.

One could, I believe, make a convincing argument for Yakuza 0 being - if not the best videogame ever made - then at least the most videogame. While this coming October’s Amazon series won’t be the first live action adaption of Yakuza, I am hopeful its episodic format will give its characters a bit more room to breathe. Or, according to Kiryu actor Ryoma Takeuchi in an interview with IGN, to find the love they’ve always longed for.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["Honey, I shrunk the first-person puzzler. Twice." This is how I like to imagine the designer of Supraworld explaining the hijinks that unfold in his life. Supraworld, the sequel to toybox explorer Supraland, is going to hit early access this year, say developers Supra Games in an update post on Steam. These are happy words for anyone who enjoyed 2019's dander among the sandcastles and erasers. A lot of games offer a "sandbox" but in Supraland, the entire world really did take place in exactly that - a sandbox out in a garden, full of toys. The sequel's launch into early access "might be in october," says the post. "We'll see."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lots of games use frogs as a means to appeal to those who believe they are cute, me being one of those people. The humble croaker dominates the wholesome category, where they take centre stage in farming sims or as detectives or as green lads who hop over platforms and hurt enemies by lashing them with their tongues.
Schim is different: you play as a frog of the shadows, not some green attention-seeker. And in a mundane world of vibrant colour, you're to bounce between patches of shade in search of a human pal whose shadow you've been unwittingly severed from. What ensues is a charming puzzler of both freedom and flow, which genuinely has you view everyday environments through the googly eyes of a phantom amphibian. It's a lovely thing, if perhaps not as emotionally charged as it implies early on.

Together we discovered that Lennox, the hot sauce eating green man seen in the game's trailer shouts "exploding knife!" when he throws his exploding knife, but he had nothing on It-Z who had a great SMG, the ability to clone herself when she dodges, and teleportation ability making her easily and indisputably the best character in the game. Alex also liked Duchess. You can check out the archive of the full stream below.


For a while lot more on Concord, which releases on PlayStation 5 and PC August on August 23, head here to read about how it plays like Destiny meets Overwatch.

In its fifth major expansion, Dawntrail, Final Fantasy XIV is facing its biggest existential crisis yet: where does your story go now that its 10-year A-plot is over? Dawntrail forges ahead with an enjoyable summer adventure to the land of Tural, doubling as a trojan horse for what lies in store for the future of the long-running MMO’s story. Dawntrail doesn’t match the narrative highs of the previous pair of expansions and is flawed in several ways, but its themes of legacy, the importance of culture, and responsible…]]></summary>

Sometimes, honest accessibility aids are falsely accused of being cheating tools; other times, a monitor will straight-up play League of Legends for you. This week, developments in gaming keyboards have sparked a new debate on what does and doesn’t fall within the scope of fair play, with mechanical keeb specialists Wooting declaring in no uncertain terms that "Rappy Snappy is not the same as Snap Tap."

Starfy isn't a particularly familiar franchise to America players. They have received four games – three for Game Boy Advance, one for DS – but only the 2009 DS game ever released in America. Today, the original three Game Boy Advance games are now available for Nintendo Switch Online subscribers. The games retain their original title, Densetsu no Stafy, and have not been localized. The gameplay has been describe as Kirby-esque, but I have never been able to confirm that myself until today.

The second I wrested this privilege from Ed Thorn's resentful fingers, however, developers Edgeflow Studio and publishers Hooded Horse delayed the early access release. Perhaps this reflects Hooded Horse's atypically forgiving, when-it's-ready approach to game publishing. Or perhaps they just hate me and wish to deny me things that might bring me pleasure. It matters not, because the game now has a new early access release date - 30th August 2024 via Steam, GOG, and the Epic Games Store. Catch a celebratory trailer below.

This rampant enthusiasm for teledoors might seem strange, given that video games are make-believe worlds held together by arbitrary squiggles of magic language. There is fundamentally no reason any video game door should obey the customary laws of spacetime. But don’t let that stop you watching the announcement trailer for Motion Blur’s Black State, a third-person stealth shooter which is heavily redolent of Metal Gear Solid but also, awash with doors that work in mysterious ways.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gotcha Gotcha Games, creators of the RPG Maker series, have announced Action Game Maker. Much like its predecessors, it aims to allow users to create games in its chosen genre without any programming experience, using a “node-based visual scripting system” (draggable arrows and concepts, basically). Could this finally be the opportunity to create the legally distinct Little Shop Of Horrors management sim of my dreams? No, of course not. The technology does not yet exist powerful enough to manifest it. Also, it's not an action game. Also, I don't know how to make games. Also it's Friday and I'm tired. Also, AGM isn't out yet. Still, I’m intrigued!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Kain is merchandised. The clans sell tales of him. Few know the truth. He was a character in a dead franchise once, as were we all. However, his contempt for anonymity drove him to inspire the creation of an upcoming (crowdfunding allowing) graphic novel. The book stars Raziel, the first-born of his lieutenants, and It’s a canonical prequel story to the original Soul Reaver. I have waited a millennium. Over time, I became less human and more…games blogger. I have had the chance to write about Legacy Of Kain precisely once. You’re goddamn right I’m going to froth at the mouth at even the vague promise of more Shakespearean monologues and time-travelling vampires.

This is not all-encompassing. Rather, it's more a conversation about this year's early standouts and other releases we plan to visit before our official Game of the Year discussions in December. Before we properly dive in, Marcus breaks down his review of Anger Foot, developer Free Lives' new first-person shooter. Afterwards, Alex highlights a small desktop game (literally) called Rusty's Retirement. We hope you enjoy this episode and find new games to play!

Welcome to kick-exalting FPS Anger Foot. Violence is brutal and cartoonish. Slight mistakes kill you instantly. The soundtrack slaps. There’s an easy Devolver labelmate orientation point here, but if Hotline Miami was a cocktail of chemical euphoria and gut guilt, like realising you’ve accidentally pocketed someone’s lighter at a festival, Anger Foot is doing whippits out of balloon animals then having a great time rhythmically headbutting a portaloo for a few hours. Similarly, it’s also a bit of a masochistic ordeal to put yourself through. But, man. What a buzz.

Anger Foot exemplifies a simple idea executed to the nth degree. As a furious sneakerhead possessing seemingly the deadliest legs in the world, you must retrieve your prized collection of stolen footwear by kicking everything in sight. The bombast accompanying this wacky premise – fast-paced, split-second action, satisfying gunplay, and delectable destructibility – turns Anger Foot from a one-kick pony into one of the year’s most exciting, challenging, and tough-to-put-down adrenaline rushes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week, Romano Righetti, Director of External and Public Affairs for DAZN, spoke about the challenges presented by IPTV piracy. Righetti says that at times it may appear that Italy's Piracy Shield blocking system is malfunctioning or ineffective, but that's not true. It's all down to pirates' use of "sophisticated services" offered by American intermediaries.  Fortunately, the solution is straightforward; force companies like Cloudflare into compliance and prosecute users.

Not for me it isn't, because now I have to compare my shabby flat, in which there are exactly zero waterslides at the time of publication, with Planet Coaster 2, in which you can expect such aquatic attractions as "meandering lazy rivers", "adrenaline-pumping wave pools", "looping flumes" and "exhilarating water coasters". Please watch the trailer while I yet again revisit the possibility of sneaking into Stoke-On-Trent's Waterworld and trying to pass myself off as the resident ghost.

        <updated>2024-07-11T14:04:49.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Double Dragon series has been around since the arcades in 1987 and has managed to maintain a surprisingly consistent release cadence in those more than 35 years. It was only last year that we played Double Dragon Gaiden, a pixelated throwback brawler (or belt-scroll action game, per its official YouTube description) take on the franchise.
This next entry is decidedly more modern, with fully 3D visuals. It's not the first time the series has explored this dimension, but it is a rare occurrence. The game is being developed by Yuke's, the developer that worked on the WWE 2K franchise until 2K19 and most recently developed AEW: Fight Forever. It is being published, or presented by, as the trailer implies, Arc System Works, the developer behind Guilty Gear and Dragon Ball FighterZ.
Double Dragon Revive is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S and One, and PC sometime in 2025.


For a whole lot more on Double Dragon, but maybe not the version of Double Dragon you're thinking, head here to read all about the 1994 movie. Back in 2019, I tracked down the film's director, James Yukich, to talk about the bizarre film's trajectory, what went wrong, and what he would have done differently had he been giving a chance to try making the film again.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[New indie action JRPG Tako No Himitsu: Ocean of Secrets  - customary disclaimer: "JRPG" is a contentious term which some feel fetishises Japan culture, while others define it more neutrally as a specific style of role-playing game - is set in a world shadowed by a long-ago war between Human and Octopus. This in itself would be borderline post-worthy, but it's also heavily inspired by Game Boy Advance RPGs such as Golden Sun, and features music created by Golden Sun composer Motoi Sakuraba alongside Terranigma composer Masanori Hikichi.

As such, I don’t have enough experience to tell you whether the currently free Pizza Hero is an especially interesting or innovative riff on the formula. However, I am simple-minded enough to enjoy the epic bacon 1.5 humour of a sentient pizza slice with a dog for a companion upgrading itself one topping at a time. This action roguelike reeks of concentrated internet like a week old-slice nestled amidst a stack of free AOL disks. But! It’s cute and fun and free, and that’s enough for me.

And that's when Veilguard game director Corrine Busche smiled, likely knowing full well that nudity in the character creator means nudity elsewhere in the game, like in Veilguard's romances, something I know BioWare fans will be delighted to hear. "This is a mature RPG," she tells me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We haven't written nearly enough about Fallout London, a gargantuan Fallout 4 total conversion that takes place in a whole new map based on England's capital city - the Big Smoke and/or Great Wen, whose real-life incarnation probably harbours at least one nuke at any given moment, though I haven't asked the King about that lately. Best not speculate.
Anyway, Fallout London is a huge effort from modders Team Folon that was recently sabotaged when Bethesda treated Fallout 4 to a next gen update to capitalise on the Amazon TV show's popularity, rendering several mods incompatible and breaking a lot of stuff. Team Folon have now fiddled with the workings and sent a Fallout London build to GOG for QA testing, which suggests that release is imminent. The catch, however, is that you will need to downgrade your copy of Fallout 4 to play the mod, because even with Team Folon's last-minute adjustments, Fallout 4 next gen and Fallout London simply don't get on.

I too yearn to bound through the Star Post portal and into a world where Sonic has to min-max his trainers and do companion quests for Big The Cat.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Starting today, Xbox Game Pass will be experiencing some changes which includes redefining of certain tiers. And later this year, there will be a handful of price increases for various tiers. Here's the exact text as it is presented on Microsoft's website.
Starting July 10, 2024, the following updates to Xbox Game Pass will take effect:
    Price changes will go into effect for new members for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, Xbox Game Pass Core, and PC Game Pass.
    Game Pass for Console will no longer be available for new members.
    Members who are already subscribed to Game Pass for Console and have automatic payment renewal enabled will be able to continue to enjoy their membership.
Also, a new Game Pass option, Xbox Game Pass Standard, will become available in the coming months. These changes will enable us to bring members more value and more great games to Game Pass.
The new Xbox Game Pass Standard tier for new members will be $15 a month and will not include access to Day One releases, EA Play, Game Pass for PC, and cloud gaming.
Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, which includes access to all the bonuses now not included in the Standard tier is increasing its price from $17 a month to $20.
Xbox Game Pass Core, which offers online access and a much smaller library of curated games, is changing its yearly from $60 to $75. The $10 monthly price for that tier, however, will remain unchanged.
PC Game Pass is increasing from $10 per month to $12, but that tier will still include Day One releases.
All of these price changes will be reflected starting on September 12.
Price changes for services you already pay for are always frustrating. What do you think of the change? Do you plan on maintaining your subscription? Or is it time to cancel?]]></summary>

But recently they've spoken a little more about the player's scummy travels across the galaxy, including how big some of the explorable planets will be, and what happens when you piss off the Hutts. In short, you're going to have a price on your head. Makes sense.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Many years ago game designers advised their peers to make their prototypes "juicy". They were talking about the nebulous collection of sensations a player is exposed to when heads explode, coins jangle, and balls bounce. Zenless Zone Zero is a game deeply informed by the philosophy of juice. Like the lootbox hawkers of yesteryear, gacha designers understand the appeal and power of a pleasingly animated gizmo, ker-chunking open and fizzing with potential. This poppy visual and sonic language stretches across Hoyo's latest game, from its cinematic moments, to each character's attacks, to the cute bunny mascots that erupt into gatling guns, to the barista's coffee-making ritual and the recipes of the robo-limbed noodle server. The menu screens, the maps, the free-to-play storefront, everything. It is all very juicy. It is pumped with juice, but only in the same way supermarket chicken is pumped with water.

Your kingdom is under attack by goblins, and the only way to get your useless underlings to chop the wood, till the fields, and train the guards needed to defend it is to provide constant surveillance. The King Is Watching is a minimalist resource-chain-em-up and wave defense goblin-knocker with a brilliant twist. I'm now a little bit obsessed with it, I think, and what is RPS if not a vehicle for chronicling my many fleeting obsessions?

A game letting you tell your own tales is dandy and all, but those stories don’t mean much if the cast feel like input/output affection bots, ready to drop trou like a clumsy Levis temp once you’ve adequately filled their invisible bonkometer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[How easy is it to buy a pirate IPTV device with a built-in subscription, offering thousands of TV channels, PPV events, video on demand, even catch-up TV? Let's rephrase that: what's Amazon's estimated delivery time for Tanggula, vSeeBox, and Superbox devices? Whether tomorrow or next week, two men who sold exactly the same devices to their own customers won't be able to compete after being hit with a $1.25m judgment in the United States.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Prolific fantasy author and number one Ranni stan (“I'll pick the ending where my character gets a waifu”) Brandon Sanderson has been thinking a lot about how to apply Elden Ring and the Souls games' signature storytelling approach to novels. During a recent playthrough on his YouTube channel, he was asked if he thinks there’s a way to replicate Souls-like descriptions in books. “I’ve wondered that. I really have,” Sanderson replies.

After half a decade on shelves, it’s still the best low-profile mechanical gaming keyboard going, and quite possibly the best wireless keyboard to boot – while the tenkeyless version, the G915 TKL Lightspeed, is just as lovely to use.
Between their nimble performance, crisp mech switches, and impeccable build quality, the only way in which the G915 duo underwhelms is their high pricing – very much the kind you’d want to wait for a Prime Day or Black Friday to dull the pain of. Now, though, there’s an alternative: the new Logitech G515 Lightspeed TKL. I’ve been using it. It’s good!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlayStation's PC efforts are paying off, if the latest U.S. Video Game Market Highlights report from analyst group Circana is any indication. That's because developer Sucker Punch Production's Ghost of Tsushima, which originally launched on PlayStation 4 back in 2020, was the best-selling game of May 2024 in the U.S. And that's almost assuredly due to the recent PC release of Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut on May 16. 
Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut hit PC almost four years after the game's initial launch on PS4, which speaks to PlayStation's PC release strategy it detailed last month. It said its live-service games, like this year's Helldivers 2 or the upcoming 5v5 hero shooter Concord, will launch day-and-date on PC, but its tentpole single-player games, like Ghost of Tsushima Directo…]]></summary>

According to ragdoll-prone shooter Helldivers 2, however, it’s better to stand to attention in mid-air and perform a crisp salute. It’s long been known that the game’s emotes confer unexpected defensive advantages, with emergency hugs sometimes shielding you against artillery fire, but now, one redditor has proven via careful scientific experimentation that they also protect you against the force of gravity.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nike and Bandai Namco are teaming up to release a Tekken 8-inspired shoe that will be available for purchase this September. Dubbed "Tekken 8 x Nike Air Foamposite One Fist," these shoes will be available through Nike, SNKRS, and select retailers in-store and online for $250, as reported by Sole Retriever. 
The shoes themselves are inspired specifically by Tekken 8's primary antagonist, Kazuya Mishima, as the colorway of the shoe is basically a spin on his outfit in-game. Sole Retriever describes the shoes as featuring an iridescent Foamposite material across the design's upper region in armory navy, with a faux crocodile skin texture across the Foamposite material, and black hues over the leather eyestays, shoe collar, and tongue. 
Check out the Tekken 8 x Nike Air Foamposite One Fist shoes for yourself below: 

As you can see, the shoes also feature the Tekken logos, a Fist logo with Tekken's signature lighting, and a nice box to hold the shoes. 
Sole Retriever reports that a second colorway in this lineup is on the way and it will reference Jin Kazama, although there's no images of what it will look like yet. 
These Tekken 8 x Nike Air Foamposite One Fist shoes will cost you $250 when they release this September. For more, read Game Informer's Tekken 8 review.

The publishing giant has reportedly closed Piranha Bytes, the studio known for cult RPGs like Gothic, Risen, and Elex, according to a worker who spoke to Polish games site CD-Action. The studio's existence had been under threat since early this year, after being targeted in Embracer's purgatorial studio massacre. At that time the German studio were hopeful to avoid being closed down, insisting "don't write us off yet!" Unfortunately, it looks like those who worked at the studio have since been laid off.

The best-known is probably Frostpunk, with its perpetual raging against the dying of the light, its ceaseless scrape for coal and wood as the temperature falls. Anoxia Station, announced this month, is similarly driven by the gathering of fossil fuels, and similarly shaped by questions of worker death and morale, but it takes you deep underground - into a sumptuous, brutal world of quartz crystals, salt caves, magma lakes, moonmilk rivers, swirling gases and, judging from the below trailer, enormous maggots and centipedes. Larva lakes, amirite.

It was reported that Pirahna Bytes was looking for a new publisher following job cuts last year. In January, following a period of radio silence and inactivity from the studio, CEO Micahel Rüve addressed reports of an impending closure by stating the company was in a “difficult situation” while expressing optimism about finding a partner by saying, “Don’t write us off yet!”

It has now been occupied by Russia for almost two years, during which, as reported by the Associated Press, Russia has demolished, rebuilt and renamed much of the city, overwriting its Ukrainian heritage.
The Disco Elysium-inspired RPG Hollow Home is a memory of Mariupol from just before the war - not a 1:1 recreation, but a collection of details, colours, personalities and some familiar buildings, painstakingly amassed and offered up in the face of erasure. Speaking to me during a very brief demo at Digital Dragons in Poland this year, artist Anastasia Hlyniana called my attention to the plants jutting from old car tyres around the game's isometric map, which she says are a common sight in Mariupol.

Since then, it's been in gated pre-alpha, offering weekend playtests to EVE Online Omega subscribers. According to a new and rather vague roadmap, should get a substantial update this November. Here’s said infographic - more pork scratching-stained napkin scrawl than sat-nav.

I've been playing the demo for "cute-creepy" RPG and life sim Mushroom Musume, in which you - an unnamed "Recluse" - cultivate and play as a series of mushroom daughters. My current mushroom daughter is called Alia. She's a Common Turquoise Truffle. She's got a small pig acquaintance, who so far hasn't tried to devour her, and a cute fuzzy hat, which she stole from outside a church - precise impact on character development still TBC.

        <updated>2024-07-08T12:38:38.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer-publisher GungHo Online Entertainment has revealed Disney Pixel RPG, an upcoming 8-bit adventure starring Mickey Mouse, Winnie the Pooh, Genie from Aladdin, Baymax from Big Hero 6, and many more beloved characters. It launches in Japan on iOS and Android devices this September, and is expected to be released in other regions of the world at a later date. 
According to the game's website, Disney Pixel RPG will feature a story about merging worlds, fast-paced strategic battles (with simple controls for mobile and even an auto-play function), customization for your own avatar character, and expeditions that allow you to send pixelated Disney characters out on missions to gather materials and more. Players in Japan can pre-register for Disney Pixel RPG right now ahead of the game's September 9 launch – there's no word on if other regions will be able to pre-register anytime soon, however. 
"The game world that these Disney characters call home have suddenly been invaded by strange programs, and are starting to break down," the story description reads on the game's website. "These previously isolated game worlds have merged, throwing all the characters into confusion. Take on the role of a player of these games and join Disney characters as you embark on an epic quest across multiple game worlds to restore order." 
The game's listing on Apple's App Store notes it will be free-to-play but will feature microtransactions. 
Here's a look at the game's combat: 
And here's a look at the game's avatar customization: 
Disney Pixel RPG launches in Japan on iOS and Android on September 9, 2024. There's no word on when to expect it in other regions of the world.

Popular speedrunning event Summer Games Done Quick took place last week and raised more than $2.5 million for Doctors Without Borders, fielding runners who took on a mix of modern and retro games with various quirky goals or challenging requirements. Like an attempt at getting through Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice without being hit (oh god) and a hasty anti-gravitational swim through the solar system of Outer Wilds but without using the game's spaceship (what). Let us be glad these folks use their powers for good.

Not so in cyberpunk tactics game All Walls Must Fall. Here time travel means dodging bullets, reversing flubbed hacking, and replaying that conversation you had with the bouncer that got you booted to the curb. “A bloody good time-troubling tactical shooter,” decreed Adam Smith (RPS in Peace) in his review.

Two days after returning home from my vacation in Japan, Tokyo-based developer Nagai Industries Inc. released a trailer for its upcoming adventure game, InKonbini: One Store. Many Stories, and I was immediately taken back to my convenience store (“konbini” is Japanese for convenience stores, generally) adventures days prior. From Lawson’s excellent spicy chicken to 7-Eleven’s life-altering egg salad sandos, convenience stores in Japan are incredible, as strange as that is to write. InKonbini is a ’90s love letter to the konbinis of Japan, and after speaking with Nagai Industries founder Dima Shen about InKonbini, I couldn’t be more sold.

The genre uses the best elements of traditional filmmaking to amplify what will always be the greatest story ever told: reality. Whether it’s an educational look at the natural world, a gripping true crime tale, or an enlightening biography of a noteworthy figure, the best documentaries manage to educate as effectively as they entertain.
The video games industry is now old enough to have been subjected to its fair share of documentaries, from The King of Kong to Indie Game: The Movie to Netflix’s High Score. But no matter how good they are, they all generate a tough-to-pin-down anxiety in me I never consciously noticed until recently: By the time the film ends, or, more often, in the middle of it, I just want to stop watching and play the…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After more than a decade of litigation in Germany, last year key questions in Sony's lawsuit against cheat device maker Datel were referred to Europe's highest court. If the Court of Justice's judgment ultimately favors Sony, the implications are likely to reach far beyond a device designed to interact with a game console discontinued a decade ago. For the greater good, it's a case that Sony must lose and for once in a copyright lawsuit, things are headed in the right direction.

Despite its story and extra 10 levels spanning dozens of hours of playtime, that’s apparently been ample time for players to complain loudly enough about one of the expansion’s brand new jobs - so much so that Square Enix have already announced a set of incoming changes planned across the game’s next run of patches.

It's also a genre I'm not overly fond of, preferring puzzles I can sometimes get through by intuition (Spring Falls), brute force (every switch-the-lights puzzle ever), or entering chaos mode (real life).
But I like Isles of Sea and Sky. From starting it almost on a whim, I was playing and figuring things out with zero fuss and no overt tutorialising pretty much immediately, and from there suddenly found that several hours had breezed by without frustration or boredom.

This is on-brand. But, oh no, a wink to real life gambling could be interpreted as a transparent acknowledgement of the gacha genre's psychological claw machine, which is maybe why the developers decided the scratchcard stall should have a sole employee: a very cute dog.

It’s a “fast-paced, juggle-based” 2D metroidvania that stands apart for a couple of reasons. Firstly, your character’s magic sword is also your means of illumination, and the levels are gloomy. And secondly, the whole “juggle-based” thing.

It's been in early access since 2019 and, hey, it's rather good. We knew developers Coffee Stain were planning a 1.0 release this year. But more concrete details from management have finally trickled down to the little guy. Version 1.0 will hit stores on September 10th, they say. The complete version will include flushable toilets, a "much sought after addition to the game", we're told.

As we celebrated the 50th anniversary of hip-hop last year, it’s now a good time to look back at how ingrained hip-hop music is in gaming, from NBA2K (remember that 2K13 soundtrack curated by Jay-Z?), Mortal Kombat, and Need for Speed, to Cyberpunk 2077 and, of course, Fortnite.
Mortal Kombat 11 came out of the gates in 2018 with a fiery trailer featuring music by 21 Savage, and later Megan Thee Stallion live-streamed an MK11 match on Twitch. The lore of Grand Theft Auto continues to grow, powered by recent GTA Online upda…]]></summary>

A house on which garden gnomes have either settled, like the avian hoodlums in Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds, or from which they have erupted, like the malignant mushrooms of Annihilation.
A hundred clay and plaster eyes catch yours, unblinking; a hundred figures seemingly freeze in the act of pushing a toy wheelbarrow or smoking a pipe. The tune you were whistling dies in your throat as you hurry past into the reassuring shadow of the relatively gnomeless bungalows to either side. Gardening sim Horticular is like that, but with an even greater sense of contrast, because it asks you to resettle a desolate planet. There is no generic urban scenery to hurry onto, here. There is only bare, cracked earth. And the gnomes.

Just within the character creator, there are hundreds of options to customize things like hair, body type, what your playable character Rook's face looks like, and so much more. There are also a ton of armor options, too. 
Companions have an armor slot, a ring slot, an accessory slot, and a weapon slot, while Rook has access to even more – a helmet, two weapon slots, a belt, an amulet slot, and two ring slots. A belt having its own slot might sound odd as it's not an armor piece people typically think of when kitting out an RPG warrior. However, the belt is an important facet of Rook's kit. The better Rook's belt, the better the potency of their healing potions, which are replenished by destroying green pots scattered about the …]]></summary>

And it’s always satisfying.
The parry mechanic is one of the novel additions of the 2023 remake developed by Capcom. Whenever a bolt or melee attack from an infected villager is about to impact Leon Kennedy, you only need to press a button to deflect with the in-game knife. This action grants an opportunity to follow up with an attack on the spot while simultaneously adding to RE4’s original close-quarter smackdown.
Adapting this to the PlayStation VR2 wasn’t easy. Instead of Leon doing a swift animation with just a button press, you need to grab the knife from your chest, lift it up in the air, and match the incoming attack. I…]]></summary>

The first Monaco released in 2013 at a point when Xbox Live Arcade had hit its stride, and there was a new appetite for the type of creative and unique game that existed below the huge budget triple-A, high-fidelity experience. Those kinds of games vastly outnumber the big-budget experiences we are familiar with today, but in 2013 we were discovering such experiences and marveling at their ingenuity. The competition is stiffer for Monaco 2 as it nears release, but creator Andy Schatz is clearly excited to revisit the criminal gameplay saying, “If Monaco 1 is about cat and mouse, Monaco 2 is about complexity and creativity.”

In the wake of such a weird cultural moment, I’m certainly not the only one left wondering how the dust settles, especially as it relates to how we meet up, build friendships and relationships, and socialize. If you’re a gamer, answering those questions requires an additional layer of complexity since we spend much of our free time in virtual worlds. I’ve found myself wondering where our favorite hobby fits into the equation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EA has announced that it will delist three Battlefield titles from the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 digital storefronts at the end of the month. 
On July 31, the PS3/Xbox 360 versions of Battlefield 3, Battlefield 4, and Battlefield: Hardline, along with their associated DLCs, will be removed from sale. Owners of these games will still be able to play their single-player content, but online support for these titles will end on November 7. The embedded announcement post on X also includes a link to an FAQ to answer additional questions about the sunsetting process. 
https://t.co/2W8dLlGjBM
June 28, 2024
While the digital PS3/Xbox 360 versions of these games are going away, Battlefield 3 will still be available to purchase on PC. The same is true for Battlefield 4 and Hardline, and these two titles will also remain on sale for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. The PC/PS4/Xbox One versions will remain unaffected by today’s updates.
It never feels good to see games get removed from sale like this. The reason likely has to do with EA sunsetting online support; it wouldn't be right to continue selling games with popular online modes if that component doesn't work anymore. For those still logging into Battlefield matches on PS3 and 360, you've got a few more months to enjoy the ride.

There is so much you could talk about, so many trails heading off in all directions, but perhaps it's best to begin with the more personal and superficial question that inspired this investigation: how did the open world game get so boring?

Nexon are even now patching the game, and have plied players with in-game bonuses and cosmetics as an apology for the inconvenience.

It’s the dogeared Fighting Fantasy from a carboot sale kid in me, I think. Something about reading worldbuilding snippets organised into numbered tables just hits in a way a novel doesn’t. Such tantalising ephemera is the name of the game in Microprose-published CrossOver: Roll For Initiative. It’s a wave defense where you play match-3 to collect dice, then spend them on fireballs and mace swings to stop tiny bastards from marauding all over your actual character sheet and attacking your stats.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Stormind Games and publisher Saber Interactive have released a new story trailer for A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead showcasing more of this upcoming first-person horror game's silent alien-infested world. And it continues to look like a scary new addition to the A Quiet Place movie universe. 
Though there's still no release date – it's launching sometime this year on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC – this story trailer reveals more about the state of the world in The Road Ahead. It seemingly begins on Day One, when the aliens, which possess incredible hearing that requires people to remain silent to survive, attack Earth. It then jumps ahead to Day 105, with Alex, an asthmatic college student trying to survive the end of the world with her boyfriend Martin, on the hunt for supplies and more. 
Check it out for yourself in the story trailer for A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead below: 


As you can see, it seems Alex might be pregnant, which, if you've seen the first A Quiet Place movie, can make trying to remain silent in this world quite difficult. We'll have to wait a little longer to find out how the story of A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead plays out because it launches later this year on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. 
For more about the game, watch the reveal trailer for A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead.

The reveal trailer features a look at the hybrid racing game, which allows players to select Autobots and Decepticons, use them in combat encounters in Bot Mode, and race as them in each Transformer's Alt Mode. You can play solo or against a friend.
Check it out for yourself in the Transformers: Galactic Trials trailer below: 


"Evil Nemesis Prime has stolen the Prime Relics, which bestow incredible powers on whoever possesses them," the game's description reads. "Now, the Autobots and Decepticons are in an explosive race to recover the relics – the future of Cybertron is in your hands. 
"Choose your character from icons like Bumblebee, Megatron, and Optimus Prime. Speed into action on battle-race circuits, drift and boost to charge up Energon, then unleash devastating special moves in battle. And use your experience to unlock new skills, characters, and skins. It's the ultimate test of your favorite Transformers' abilities, which will decide the future of Cybertron."

One of the smaller chunks was a brief comment by Resident Evil 7 director Koshi Nakanishi, who confirmed that a new Resident Evil game is in the works. That's not too much of a surprise - big franchise gonna franchise - but still, it's nice to hear.  "It was really difficult to figure out what to do after [Resident Evil] 7," he said, "but I found it. And to be honest it feels substantial."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Fear & Hunger games are pitch-black horror RPGs quite unlike anything else I’ve ever played, taking aspects of JRPG, survival horror and adventure games and distilling them into something I’d be tempted to call bleakly nihilistic if they didn’t display so much evident love for their craft. They also both start with a content warning listing “extreme violence, gore, sexual violence, and drug usage”. You’ll want to take this seriously, and just to be clear: the third item on this list does manifest in some tasteless, albeit brief, ways in the first game. It’s a frustrating blemish on what is otherwise an incredibly evocative and creative series, though you can download a mod to censor the more egregious bits. You will miss the full effect of critically severing an ogre’s massive schlong, however.

Developer Capcom released a demo for the game yesterday, ahead of its July 19th release date. So now the rest of us can join Edwin in becoming entranced by the swirling colours of this sword-swinger.

Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess
Ahead of its launch on July 19, the fantastical action-strategy hybrid is getting a demo later today on all platforms the game is available on.

My journey from east to west, north to south of Seoul was only possible by the city’s expansive public transportation network of buses and trains. And while I listened to “Magnetic” by K-Pop group ILLIT more times than I’ll admit (when in Korea, right?) through headphones on these trains and buses, I spent much of my time observing how others spent time waiting for their stop.

It's easily the best character creator in series history and possibly the most robust I've ever seen in a video game. From hundreds of sliders and options to customize your player-controlled Rook to the ability to pick pronouns separate from gender and more, this character creator speaks directly to the inclusivity of Veilguard – read about my in-depth look at the character creator here.

"Don't turn off your system when this symbol is displayed," goes the message seen often while booting up a game (or some other version of these words). The implication is clear. The saving process is delicate and if you interrupt this invisible ritual the data that's being written to some folder deep in your PC's innards will become corrupted, wrecked, banjaxed. You will lose all your progress, all your precious swords and accomplishments.
But is this true? How likely are you to really suffer a catastrophic loss of shotgun shells? To find out, I decided to spend a very annoying afternoon of turning my gaming rig off and on again during multiple games. Was this a good idea? I don't know. I'm a gamer, not an ideas man.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn has gone gold, meaning it should be all but ready for its release on July 18. Developer A44 (Ashen) has also released the game’s PC specs and 20-minutes of raw gameplay footage.
The upcoming "Souls-lite" fantasy action game stars elite soldier Nor Vanek and her furry fox-like companion Enki on a revenge quest to kill the gods of their world. She wields an arsenal of melee, firearms, and magic that can be chained to create stylish combo attacks. Nor Venek also has special traversal abilities to navigate the world, which is being besieged by the angry deities.
We last saw Flintlock during the Xbox Games Showcase a few weeks ago, but you can check out 20 minutes of new gameplay footage in the video below. Set during a later stage of the game, a synopsis adds context to the footage: "Join Nor and Enki as they prepare to step into the deserts of Wanderer’s Rest to take on the personal guard of the god Dukmar. With an entire army hunting for her, Nor will need all of her skills to make it to her eventual destination - the City of Sibyl, where she hopes the gods’ true intentions will finally be revealed."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time reinvented the series in 3D and became its new gold standard, Nintendo followed up with a surreal sequel in Majora's Mask. Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days. Majora's Mask's unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.
Join Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard today and each Friday on Twitch at 1:00 p.m. CT as they gradually work their way through the entire game until Termina is saved.

Infinity Nikki’s big PlayStation State of Play spotlight in May garnered an array of reactions. Fans of the popular Nikki series of mobile fashion games were excited to see the pink-haired fashionista make her triple-A debut. Unfamiliar viewers either dismissed it as an overly whimsical dress-up game or found themselves unexpectedly intrigued by its delightful and unique spin on an open-world experience. I count myself in that third camp. Something about the game’s premise stuck with me, but after playing several hours of a beta version, I’ve gone from admiring Infinity Nikki conceptually to being genui…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Don't Nod Entertainment has delayed its upcoming two-part narrative-driven adventure game, Lost Records: Bloom & Rage, to early 2025. As for why, the team wants to give its spiritual cousin, Life Is Strange: Double Exposure, some space to shine later this year. 
Lost Records was originally due out in late 2024, which is also when the next Life is Strange is set to launch. Instead of competing with Life Is Strange, a series that Don't Nod created with the first Life Is Strange and continued with Life Is Strange 2 before Double Exposure developer Deck Nine took over with 2017's Before the Storm and 2021's True Colors, the studio decided to push to 2025. 
We've made the decision to move the release dates of Lost Records: Bloom & Rage to early 2025. We know you're all excited for both Lost Records and the new Life is Strange game, and we wanted to ensure both have adequate space to shine. The wait will be worth it! pic.twitter.com/PH1O7z3uUy
June 28, 2024
Life Is Strange: Double Exposure launches October 29, and now, Lost Records: Bloom & Rage, which will be released in two parts, will launch sometime early next year. Both games are set to release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. 
In the meantime, watch the reveal trailer for Lost Records: Bloom & Rage, and then watch the Life Is Strange: Double Exposure reveal trailer. After that, check out this extended Double Exposure gameplay trailer to learn how the game will acknowledge the first Life Is Strange's endings.

Despite my expectations, I was not prepared for how robust it actually is in Veilguard. Robust enough, even, that BioWare used it to create most of the NPCs in the game, save for mainline characters like companions. Setting hyperbole aside, it is a staggeringly rich creation system, and I look forward to seeing player-created near-replicas of celebrities and monstrous creations that'd be more at home in a horror game. 
But I'm also looking forward to the community's reaction to the Dragon Age series' best character creator yet. At the heart …]]></summary>

We have a lot of questions remaining about the game's progression, seasonal content, narrative emphasis, and more, but if the handful of hours we've played of Concord are any indication, developer Firewalk Studios has, at the very least, created a fun and great-feeling shooter.

Last month, PlayStation released the first big look at Concord, its upcoming 5v5 multiplayer hero shooter from Firewalk Studios, a team it acquired last year. Though the recent cinematic footage teases something like a single-player, narrative-driven heist game akin to a Guardians of the Galaxy movie, the gameplay reveal that followed showcased the strictly multiplayer experience in a new light. Admittedly, this reveal left me feeling blasé; it looked fine, but not necessarily something I hadn't seen before. However, after playing the game for a few hours during a recent previ…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Frostpunk 2 has been delayed. Originally slated to launch next month on July 25, the upcoming narrative-driven city-builder is now arriving on September 20.
Developer 11 Bit Studios sates that following a recent beta, the team wants to take extra time addressing feedback to ensure the best possible experience. In a press release, design director Jakub Stokalski and art director Lukasz Juszczyk issued the following statement:
“Based on the surveys we received after playing Beta, the average rating you gave us was 8 out of 10. We’re super grateful for that! At the same time, it was only a small slice of a work-in-progress, still-growing game. While our backlog is plentiful, it was an opportunity for us to listen to what you enjoyed, and what didn’t quite land yet”. 
“This allowed us to prioritise things better, and bring upfront the features and modifications we were already working on. But we also realised that to guarantee the best possible experience on launch, we need more time to finish the development of Frostpunk 2. That’s why we made the difficult decision to postpone its release to September 20th, 2024”.
11 Bit States that it plans to work on new additions to existing game mechanics and improve the UI and UX, among other things. 
Frostpunk 2 will launch first for PC on September 20. PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S versions are planned to arrive later. We recently played the game, and you can read our extensive preview here.]]></summary>

In the reveal trailer, we get a look at the graphical improvements Aspyr has implemented in Star Wars: Bounty Hunter, but the game still retains that 2002 PlayStation 2 and GameCube charm. This re-release follows a limited PlayStation 4 physical run that launched back in 2019. 
Check out the Star Wars: Bounty Hunter announcement trailer below: 


If you're unfamiliar with Star Wars: Bounty Hunter, you play as Jango Fett throughout the story, which itself is a prequel to Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones. 
In the original game, there was an easter egg message that said, "Cash in all bounties to play as Boba." However, cashing in all bounties did not let you play as Boba. To make good on that original promise from 2002, Aspyr media has included a Boba Fett skin in Star Wars: Bounty Hunters you can use after completing the game's campaign. 
Star Wars: Bounty Hunter hits PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC on August 1. 
While waiting for its launch, check out this lengthy gameplay demo of Star Wars Outlaws, another mercenary-centric Star Wars game launching this year. Read Game Informer's Star Wars Outlaws cover story after that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Capcom has revealed Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster, a remaster of the Xbox 360 game that first launched in 2006. Though the once previously Xbox-exclusive game has since made its way to PlayStation and PC platforms, it remains unclear which platforms this remaster is coming to. And there's no word on when to expect the remaster either. 
Revealed with a short 47-second teaser trailer, Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster looks great, almost more like a remake than a remaster. It's unclear if this is a remaster of the original 2006 game or the HD version of Dead Rising that launched on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC back in 2017. Regardless, we're stoked to head back into a zombie-infested mall with journalist Frank West whenever this remaster launches.

Outside of remasters and remakes, the Super Monkey Ball franchise has been dormant for a decade. At a certain point, it began feeling like AiAi and his crew of monkeys were relics of a bygone era and that Super Monkey Ball was little more than a nostalgic series that has no real place in the modern gaming landscape. Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble disputes that assertion by delivering an experience that’s at once delightful, maddening, and rewarding, but above all else, fun.
At its best, Banana Rumble’s Adventure Mode delivers some of the top stages in Super Monk…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Publisher Playtonic Friends (the publishing arm of Yooka-Laylee developer Playtonic) and Blossom Tales developer Castle Pixel have revealed Cattle Country, a simulation game that's Stardew Valley meets the Wild West. If its first trailer,  which was revealed by IGN today, is any indication, farming/townbuilding sim fans will want to keep an eye on the game. 
The reveal trailer gives us a great look at what to expect, which includes ranching, treasure hunting, mining, farming, and, of course, romancing. The game is coming to PC sometime in the future, but there's no release date or window in sight. Cattle Country's Steam listing simply says the release date is "to be announced." 
Check out the Cattle Country reveal trailer for yourself below: 


As you might be able to hear, the Cattle Country reveal trailer is narrated by Red Dead Redemption 2's Arthur Morgan, or rather, Arthur Morgan's voice actor, Roger Clark. 
"Cattle Country straddles the saddle of cozy wholesome gaming and action-adventure," the game's Steam listing reads. "Serving up hours of the slice-of-life you'd expect on the frontier – including mining, fishing, crafting, and farming – along with deep-rooted Wild West quests delivering stories of romance, cattle drives, bandits, and robberies."
Here are some Cattle Country screenshots: 

While waiting to learn more about Cattle Country, read Game Informer's Stardew Valley review, and then read about Stardew Valley developer ConcernedApe's next simulation game, Haunted Chocolatier.
