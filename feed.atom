It's an almost experimental little town management game where you have no control over building placement, your citizens all look like they were made in Picrew, and love is a plentiful yet almost useless resource. I quite like it, but I wish I liked it more.

The latest UK Charts data is in and, to little surprise, Nintendo's Pikmin 4 has taken the crown this week after its debut on July 21st, 2023.
According to GamesIndustry's Chris Dring, the boxed sales for Pikmin 4 were slightly lower than what Fire Emblem Engage managed earlier in the year, perhaps indicating a potential early drop-off. Nevertheless, he also confirmed that sales were 45% higher than Pikmin 3 Deluxe back in October 2020, so that's definitely good news.

Nintendo has mentioned on a number of occasions how it wants to improve stock and reduce supply shortages, and while it's an ongoing effort, sometimes there's a lot more demand for certain products.
Last week, it released amiibo for the Xenoblade Chronicles characters Pyra and Mythra. These also happen to be some of the final amiibo for Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. Unfortunately, in some locations in certain parts of the world, it seems these figures have been made available in limited supply and to top it off, scalpers are at it again - reselling the same product on websites like eBay at a higher price.

When this classic does return, players can expect 4K presentation, remastered art and HD cutscenes, a remixed soundtrack, "unlimited frame rates", restored "never-before-seen" content, and even brand new story episodes.

Ultimate GameCube controller.
In somewhat surprising news, it's apparently getting a restock on Amazon Japan. There are no differences to past shipments - it's still the exact same controller, which was originally re-released alongside Super Smash Bros. Wii U, and will be made available next month on 6th August.

You'll find discounts aplenty, as well as some exclusive demos for upcoming games. Steam users interested in stickers can also claim a free sticker for every day of the event.
After looking through the sale, there are a ton of Ubisoft games discounted for this event. Pretty much every game in the Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, Tom Clancy, and Watch Dogs franchises are on sale for 60% off or more. I don't think I've ever quite realized just how much Ubisoft likes making stealthy games. Thanks, Steam!
Overall there are some pretty decent sales in here with most discounts being at least 75% off or more. To commemorate the start of the Stealth Fest, Steam has sneakily released a trailer for the event.

Often, they’re running on much less powerful hardware, and that can reflect in many different ways on the game. It might have less action, more slowdown, or it could just be a lot uglier. Other times, the home port of a notorious quarter-muncher might be rebalanced for the living room, as is the case with Super Smash T.V. or the NES Contra.
Old ports are also interesting from a design standpoint. Many were done by people who weren’t associated with the original production and didn’t have any access to the original code. They were, in a way, just sketching the closest facsimile they could to the original version. The faithfulness of the port was, therefore, all down to the analytical skills of the developer, as well as their access to the…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Joel Jordan has dropped Time Bandit – Part 1: Appendages of the Machine on Steam and itch.io today. You might remember it from my blockbuster article, “Here are eleven 2022 indie games to look forward to.” It’s now the middle of (checks watch) 2023, and it has finally arrived.
Time Bandit is the story of having a crappy job and working for the man. In this case, however, the man is exploiting workers and using them to gather time crystals for potentially nefarious purposes.
https://youtu.be/Ug4Uokxc1F0
But slow down there since Time Bandit also runs on a real-time clock. Sort of like Pokemon Gold/Silver! Your shift is based on real-world time, and different tasks take different amounts of time. Sometimes you even need to meet characters at a specific time of day that they’ll schedule with you in advance. You’d going to need to rein in that spontaneity if you want to overthrow your capitalist overlords.
I was hoping to get a review of Time Bandit – Part 1: Appendages of the Machine up at launch, but ironically, I just haven’t had the time. Hopefully, I can circle back to it because I really enjoyed the build that I played last year. I also provided feedback directly to Joel, so I’m eager to see if any of it was incorporated. It’s like I have skin in the game when, in reality, I’m not really much different than any normal commenter.
Time Bandit – Part 1: Appendages of the Machine is available on PC and Mac via Steam and itch.io starting today.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Indie studio Universal Happymaker announced their management adventure Astronaut: The Best will release for PC via Steam on August 15. In Astronaut, players have the task of managing an occult space academy in an uncanny world.
"Our team spent over eight years working to make a bizarre moral laboratory of a game, that feels truly unlike anything you've played before," said Mike Sennott, Lead Developer on Astronaut: The Best. "We hope you'll be deeply and delightedly surprised by what you find inside, and that makes all those years worth it."
Sennott was the Narrative Designer on the popular indie tactical RPG Wintermoor Tactics Club. The team also released a new launch date announcement trailer showing off Astronaut's weirdness.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbkPomZBxyE
Running a culty space academy doesn't look easy
In Astronaut: The Best, it's literally your job to guide procedurally generated misfit recruits through a roguelite hodgepodge of scandals and challenges. You can guide your Astronaut team via a variety of methods including lies, witchcraft, and of course some good ole classic hard work. New recruits can be former serial killers, part-time pirates, or even members of the royal family. The team at Universal Happymaker notes that choices will actually have an impact on each recruit as well as their likelihood to succeed.
This game is definitely very weird looking, which has really piqued my interest. It's weird looking in an intriguing way. The visuals are uncanny for sure and in some aspects eerily creepy. It's sort of giving me Cultist Simulator vibes with a bit of Homestar Runner between the graphic and comedic style. I'm interested to see just how strange the game can get.
Astronaut: The Best releases on PC via Steam on August 15. It is also Steam Deck compatible.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Previously only available on itch.io, Taylor McCue has released their traumatic Game Boy Color art game, He Fucked the Girl Out of Me, on Steam. You can now nab it there for the price of free.
I’ve covered He Fucked the Girl Out of Me a couple of times now, but it was something that burrowed under my skin and has lived there since. Being a semi-autobiographical retelling of a slew of problematic topics such as sex work, getting it on Steam is no small matter. For one thing, it gets lumped in with all the 18+ games that have names like Sex Campus Story. I mean sure, minors should probably not play either one, but one has clearly different goals.
While the game is free, there are a few donation options presented as DLC, which I think is kind of neat. Beyond simple game design, Taylor does quite a bit to help the queer game development community.
Again, however, I’d like to be clear in saying that you should be careful playing He Fucked the Girl Out of Me and definitely pay attention to the content warnings. Not everyone is going to have such a visceral reaction to the subject matter, but some will. I’d hate for someone to think they are just going to be playing a neat Game Boy Color game and walk away with vicarious trauma.
You’ve been warned, but if you still feel like checking out He Fucked the Girl Out of Me, you can get it now on Steam.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Paramount Pictures and Xbox are teaming up to give you a chance to get your hands on exactly what you've been looking for: a pizza-scented Xbox controller. The cheesy (hehe) event is to celebrate the upcoming Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem movie that releases on August 2.
The Xbox Wireless Controllers come with a built-in scent diffuser shaped like a pizza slice. There's a controller variation for each of the Turtle brothers: Leonardo, Raphael, Donatello, and Michaelangelo. The announcement provided no details on the type of pizza we can smell from the controller. I mean, what exactly are we talking about here? Just cheese? Pepperoni? An aromatic supreme pie? Just say it isn't pineapple.
Those who need help getting hungry for a pizza while they game can enter to win one of the controllers pretty easily. Simply follow Xbox Game Pass on Twitter and retweet the official Xbox Game Pass sweepstakes tweet. The giveaway starts on July 24 and lasts through August 13. You can find the full list of rules and eligibility details here.
https://twitter.com/XboxGamePass/status/1683492348234199041
Cowabunga, dude!
The controllers themselves have pretty cool TMNT-themed skins, but the "pizza diffuser" looks a bit off. It kind of looks like one of those plastic doggy squeak toys. This is obviously very gimmicky but I guess it could be cool getting a whiff of pizza-y goodness while playing Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge.
Also part of the event is a new TMNT DLC for Minecraft. The turtles-themed DLC allows you to play as any of the four turtles and explore iconic locations such as the Turtle Lair and fight baddies like Krang.
If you're not confident you will win one of these limited controllers, there's still a chance to smell the 'za. Gamers in the NYC area can head over to the Xbox Gaming Lounge at the Microsoft Experience Center on Fifth Avenue and sniff the controllers from 4-7 p.m. EST on August 2.

        <updated>2023-07-24T17:00:30.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ludicrously late notice
Apogee, Nightdive, and New Blood have announced that the console version of Rise of the Triad: Ludicrous Edition will be delayed on console. No date has been given for when we can expect the game to hit Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PS4, PS5, and Nintendo Switch, but the PC version is still expected to drop on July 31, 2023.
Rise of the Triad was first released back in 1994 for DOS. It was a pretty ballsy move to release a game built on the Wolfenstein 3D engine after Doom took the forefront of first-person shooters in 1993. To be certain, Rise of the Triad really doesn’t stack up to the monolith it was competing against. But whenever I hear stories of its development, it sounds like Tom Hall and his team had fun creating it.
https://youtu.be/vRdZEY6EL5I
That shows in its actual gameplay. What it lacks in fancy technical tricks, it makes up for in its ridiculous design. There are Nazi-esque soldiers begging for their life or playing dead and heat seeking missiles that home in on torches. There are a lot of fun touches that make for a really memorable experience.
This is pure speculation, but I wonder if the delay is due to the inclusion of Return of the Triad. This was a fan-made sequel created in the GZDoom Engine. If they wanted to include it in the console versions, they’d have to either port it into the KEX Engine or run it under GZDoom. I’m not sure how simple that is to do in terms of both development and licensing. It’s a worthwhile inclusion, though, as it’s a fantastic little offshoot.
Rise of the Triad: Ludicrous Edition launches on PC on July 31, 2023. The console versions will follow later this year.

As we gear up for the Pokemon Scarlet & Violet double-DLC-drops this year, Game Freak and company are doling out more free gifts for the pair of recent mainline games. This time the newest promo involves a dark Tera Type Charizard: and who doesn't love a Charizard?! Especially given that you can't acquire one in Scarlet & Violet through normal gameplay.
Here's how to get the special July 2023 Charizard
We have a full breakdown on how to access the mystery gift system here. In short, it involves finishing up the tutorial (which requires you to get through the academy portion, after the bout with Arven) to fully unlock the required menu.
After you've completed the tutorial, complete the following steps:
Press X and select “Poke Portal”
On the Poke Portal screen, scroll down and find the code option and select it
Enter the code DARKTERA0006
Here are some details for the July 2023 Charizard in case you need to discern whether or not it's worth even booting up the game for:
Level 50
Dark Tera Type
Moves: Crunch, Flare Blitz, Acrobatics, Belly Drum
This promo will run through August 31, 2023, so you have some time. If you're seeking out more information, the original source of this code is straight from The Pokemon Company's site.

“Whenever I think about the future of Techland, I want the best for our games, the team, and you,” said Techland’s CEO Paweł Marchewka in today’s blog post. “And while I am very proud of our achievements as an independent studio over all these years, I believe the best is yet to come.”


Marchewka continued to say that “teaming up with Tencent” would allow the team to “move full speed ahead” with future plans for the Dying Light series and their in-development fantasy RPG. Marchewka emphasised that the studio will retain “full ownership” of their intellectual property and “maintain creative freedom.” Marchewka will also continue to serve as Techland’s CEO.

Magical or plain bad. Some indie developers chose the latter with a Myst FPS remix that spoofed the senior adventure game.

But Humble Games leans toward the former as it’s choosing to celebrate the classic's whopping 30th birthday with a returning charity bundle, available now until August 3rd.


The Humble Myst & More Bundle packages the titular point-and-clicker, alongside several other sequels, spiritual successors, and odd offshoots from developer Cyan Worlds. You can pay anything over £7.80/$10 for the 11-game bundle, or you can pay at least £15.60/$20 to also grab the Myst remake from 2021. 


Cyan Worlds loves a good re-release, and this latest bundle is a reminder of how many Mysts have Mysted over the years. There’s Myst: Masterpiece Edition which remasters the music and imagery, and is otherwise as close to the original as you can get. Then there’s realMyst: Masterpiece Edition which added changing weather, day-night cycles, free roam movement, and a bonus epilogue. And finally, there’s the most recent pretty remake that’s also compatible with VR.

I miss Club Nintendo, but My Nintendo is the new reality. Gone are the days of elaborate statues for physical rewards, and annual loyalty bonuses (which, most of the time, ruled!). That said, My Nintendo does surprise us from time to time, and lately, they've been cooking up a ton of rewards to coincide with the summer release calendar. With all of the Zelda, Kirby, and Pikmin rewards on the My Nintendo marketplace at the moment, I figured it was worth reminding people that yes: your points do expire. Here's how to do a quick scan and see when everything will fall off.
[caption id="attachment_393208" align="alignnone" width="640"] Screenshot by Destructoid[/caption]
How to check when your My Nintendo points are expiring
Head to the My Nintendo website
Scroll all the way down to the bottom of the page and click on the "point summary" link
At the top of the screen, look for the "points expiration" link and click that
From there, you'll be able to see an itemized rolling total of when all of your points are going to expire month-to-month. That includes Platinum points, as well as individualized mobile game points.
This is an important screen to check every so often (I just did it and splurged on the new Pikmin rewards!), as you'll want to dump points into rewards if they're going to expire at the end of the month anyway. It's a sneaky way for Nintendo to create point churn, and prevent folks from just playing through Fire Emblem Heroes, amassing thousands of points, and saving them for big-ticket rewards.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dying Light developer, Techland has announced a partnership with Tencent that will see the massive Chinese holdings company become the studio’s majority shareholder.
In a blog post penned by Techland founder and CEO Paweł Marchewka, he explains the studio has partnered with Tencent for support of its continued expansion of the Dying Light series and to ensure its upcoming fantasy RPG lives up to expectations.
“Teaming up with Tencent will allow us to move full speed ahead with the execution of the vision for our games,” Pawel writes. “We have chosen an ally who has already partnered with some of the world's finest video game companies and helped them reach new heights while respecting their ways of doing things.”
Pawel states that he will remain CEO, and Techland will retain full ownership of its IPs. He also assures the studio has full creative freedom. While the Polish company is best known as the maker of the Dying Light series, Call of Juarez, and the original Dead Island, it also has a publishing branch. Titles released under Techland's umbrella include Arise: A Simple Story and Torment: Tides of Numenera.
This is business as usual for Tencent, which has dipped its hands into a number of game studios in recent years. It has invested in (or has outright acquired) companies such as Epic Games, From Software, Turtle Rock Studios, Riot Games, Ubisoft, Activision Blizzard, Remedy Entertainment, among others.

There are a whole lot of beat-em-up games out there to sink your teeth into, but how many of them circulate around rescuing helpless animals from hoards of evil poachers? Taito's Growl is one such game and it is making its way to the Arcade Archives this week from 27th July (thanks, Nintendo Everything).
Originally released in Japanese arcades in 1990 (later on the Genesis in 1991), Growl sees you playing as one of four rangers who set out on a mission to take down a group of poachers that are hunting the local wildlife. HAMSTER has uploaded an announcement trailer for this one (above) which shows the kind of all-explosive action that this beat-em-up is all about — because nothing soothes an afraid lion like the sound of four rocket launchers, right?

Soapbox features enable our individual writers and contributors to voice their opinions on hot topics and random stuff they've been chewing over. Today, Jim chews over how Tears of the Kingdom is a step in the right direction for the series' banana-loving bandits...

Let me start with a confession. When I initially started Tears of the Kingdom, I had forgotten about the Yiga Clan. In the run-up to the game's release, my mind had been so preoccupied with thoughts of "What's the plan for dungeons?", "Am I going to need to re-learn the timeline?", and "Please, for the love of Hylia, don't let those flipping Koroks come back", that Master Kohga and co. had taken a backseat in my considerations. And so, when I was first ambushed by an undercover Yiga while making an early trek across Hyrule Field, I was a little disappointed. You see, I never liked the Yiga Clan, and I didn't think that I wanted them back.

As someone who grew up primarily in the 1990s, I’ve played more than my fair share of 2D platformers. With those decades of experience, it’s no surprise that I consider myself a relatively strong platforming player. However, despite its precise controls, Mr. Run and Jump’s challenging, neon-bathed obstacle courses and hard-to-reach collectibles had me second-guess my skills at every step.
Developed initially as a homebrew Atari 2600 game, Mr. Run and Jump errs on the side of simplicity with i…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Easy peasy
Nintendo is no stranger to using the "Switch news channel" to give out items, whether you remember it exists or not. As a refresher, that little red speech bubble icon on the bottom of your Switch home screen is actually an app, which occasionally provides free stuff. Sometimes it'll offer up digital items for core franchises, including some promos for Zelda: Breath of the Wild back in the day. Now they're turning their sights to Tears of the Kingdom, and you can take advantage of it.
The news story in question is called "Whip enemies into shape," and you'll just click right on it and launch Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom directly from the app. After that, you'll log in and get the items instantly.
The items you'll acquire from this news story are:
A Lizalfos Tail
A Traveler's Sword
This is just enough gear to allow Link to fuse them together to create a whip. Hence, "whip enemies into shape." Cute, but underwhelming.
Yep, that's it! I warned you they were just "OK." Free is free, but hopefully, Nintendo steps things up and at least provides more unique items: potentially some amiibo stuff folks have missed out on (given the current state of re-releases and stock).
[Thanks John!]

She’s an amazing sword fighter; her acrobatic and graceful nature lets her outwit anyone who crosses her blade. She’s got panache, cheek, and a sharp wit to boot. And speaking of - her boots! Her hat! Her cape! She’s got endless style! And when she punts a soldier off a dock ledge and into the sea, my heart skips a beat.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gather 'round, kids!
There's really nothing quite like a child's imagination, is there? Before the dire reality of adulthood robs them of any shred of innocence, children are able to completely alter almost every facet of their lives, including their personality, their surroundings, and the people around them. It's really quite remarkable.
Parents in Japan have clearly cottoned on to this and have decided to utilise the Pikmin franchise to keep their children from misbehaving. As spotted by the folks over at Automaton, parents essentially allow their children to pretend to be Pikmin, thus ensuring that they remain close when out and about.

Ever since we learnt that Ash Ketchum and Pikachu would be leaving the Pokémon animated series, our thoughts have naturally turned to what comes next. Pokémon Horizons began to air in Japan back in April, and The Pokémon Company has now revealed a sneak peek at the series' Western dub at San Diego Comic-Con 2023.
The 11-minute clip (found above) introduces us to the new series protagonist, Liko, as she first visits the Kanto region and enrols in school there. This all builds up to Liko getting her first partner Pokémon — but who is it going to be? You'll have to watch the teaser to find out (though it will come as no surprise to those who have paid attention to the marketing so far).

        <updated>2023-07-23T17:23:52.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[And I believe it
According to Remnant 2 Principal Designer Ben Cureton, no one has seen or obtained 100% of everything the Souls-like has to offer. My 30-some hours in the game are casual numbers to some, but even still I believe this claim.
"For those that love secrets and exploring, no one has seen or obtained 100% of everything #Remnant2 has to offer," Cureton tweeted. "I'm talking about hardcore players with over 400+ hours, reviewers that had early access, even our own internal developers. No one. Remnant 2 has secrets within secrets within secrets. We made sure obtaining 100% Achievements is very player-friendly and then went far beyond that to keep the game rewarding long after you've hit that goal."
https://twitter.com/verytragic/status/1682061381141446657
Randomization probably plays a bit of a role in this
Almost everything in Remnant 2 is random. Even at the beginning of the game, the first world you adventure to is not linear. Therefore, some of the secrets in the game probably require specific parameters to be met under the right conditions. Honestly, it's one of the things that makes Remnant 2 so great. Every run is different, creating the opportunity for infinite replayability. Some of the maps also have their own unique side-zones that may hold some clues on discovering these unseen secrets.
Even though no one has seen everything just yet, I wonder how long this will hold up once the game releases. As of now, there's still a pretty small pool of players that have played.  I'm sure there will be some explorers and completionists that team up to try and hunt down everything there is to find.
Remnant 2 launches on July 25 on PC, PlayStation  5, and Xbox Series X|S. Those that pre-order the Ultimate Edition get early access and jump into the game on July 21.

It's time to witness another clash of the covers as we dive into this week's edition of Box Art Brawl!
Last time, things got medieval as we matched up two different covers from the DS' Castlevania: Order of Ecclesia with North America facing off against the combined forces of Europe and Japan. Holy smokes was this a close one! NA just managed to seal the victory with 55% of the vote, while EU/JP took home 45% — that's some classic Box Art Brawl action right there.

Unless you count most of the movies in the Pirates Of The Caribbean series, every pirate-themed movie made after the 1960s has brought nothing but financial ruin to Hollywood. Cutthroat Island? It sunk an entire studio.  Disney's Treasure Planet and Sinbad: Legend Of The Seven Seas? Many credit them for having killed traditional 2D animation altogether. Hardly the crime any movie pirate would like to be remembered for.
Luckily, pirates have thrived in the world of gaming — in more ways than one — you could say. Over the course of its entire history, gaming has featured a wide variety of pirate-themed games. There's no lack of offers, variety, and quality, so let's find out which one is the best of them all.

It cannot be understated how much music has influenced the public consciousness. Certain songs have become the theme of generations, and the constant evolution of music, and music creation is still one of the most prevalent forms of expression today. Take someone like Moshibass for example, and his Kirby Otamatone.
[caption id="attachment_392731" align="alignnone" width="640"] Screenshot by Moshibass[/caption]
Kirby Otamatone leads Troupe in Bring Me to Life Cover
For those who are unfamiliar, the Otamatone is a portable music synthesizer created in the shape of an eighth note. To play the instrument, you squeeze its head. This is followed by sliding your fingers up and down the "stem" to change the pitch. You can also add vibrato to the sounds played by shaking the Otamatone. Its popularity has skyrocketed online, especially thanks to Moshibass' cover of Bring Me to Life by Evanescence.
The cover contains a full backing track, with main vocals provided by a Kirby-themed Otamatone Deluxe. Backup vocals are performed by Hello Kitty and Gudetama-themed Otamatones. Moshibass brings their previous knowledge as a musician and music teacher to cleverly translate the lyrics of the classic 2000s song into a silly ballad with cutesy musical notes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmxLja-DRIw
If you've heard the song, you'll be able to hear the lyrics coming from Kirby and the rest of the Otamatones. You can see the video, and Moshibass' other Otamatone covers on their youtube channel. The channel also includes a tutorial on how to play your own Otamatone, as well as tutorials for popular video game songs on guitar, and ukelele.

Sega Bass Fishing is a classic arcade game from 1997 that, as the title suggests, has players pulling out their rods, bait, and fishing lines. For a limited time, Sega is giving the game away for free on Steam, and there aren't too many hoops to jump through to acquire it.

How to get Sega Bass Fishing for free
Since its release, Sega Bass Fishing has been ported to several systems, including the Dreamcast, Xbox 360, PS3, and Wii. It's a dated game, so the minimum spec requirements won't be taxing any modern PCs.
The only thing you need to do to grab your free copy of Sega Bass Fishing on Steam is to sign up for Sega's newsletter. There isn't too much personal information needed except your name, birth date, country of residence, and email address.
Before submitting the sign-up form, remember to tick the box at the bottom to indicate that you want a copy of the game. You have until July 31 to sign-up for the game. The codes for it will be mailed out starting August 1.
Interested in more classic arcade games? Grab the Dreamcast Collection bundle on Steam. It comes with a host of nostalgia-inducing titles including Crazy Taxi and Sonic Adventure 2.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Throwing down the gauntlet.
The DS remake of Final Fantasy IV turns 15 today in North America - can you believe it? If the copious social media posts earlier this week about Nolan's The Dark Knight didn't make you feel old, then perhaps this will.
Regardless, it still stands to this day as one of the most impressive remakes we've seen. Granted, the DS visuals probably aren't the most striking you're ever going to lay eyes on, particularly 15 years after its debut, but it was nevertheless a remarkably faithful adaptation that managed to retain everything that made the original so great while adding a few new bits and bobs.

I've been playing Mortal Kombat off and on since the early 90s, and while I have a good grasp of the breadth of the cast, there are still names and faces that slip through the cracks. Names like Li Mei. I don't remember her from any of the games, so I shot over to the awful Mortal Kombat Fandom wiki to get a refresher on this fighter I'd completely forgotten.
Even after reading her bio, I still don't remember her. But I guess we'll be reacquainted later this year as a new trailer from NetherRealm today confirmed she's coming to Mortal Kombat 1 alongside Tanya, who I do remember from Mortal Kombat X. Both fighters feature heavily in the spot, as does Baraka, who is back as a playable character.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sLJ-xyjMQo
With the game still several weeks from launch, NetherRealm decided now is as good a time as any to confirm all the DLC rumors that have been swirling since it was revealed. In a second trailer released on Friday, the developer confirmed the kombatants of what will likely be the first Kombat Pack. Included are:
Omni-Man (Invincible)
Homelander (The Boys)
Peacemaker (Peacemaker, Suicide Squad)
Quan Chi (Mortal Kombat: Defenders of the Realm)
Ermac (Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3)
Takeda (Mortal Kombat X)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eT-3vhCl6N4
Mortal Kombat 1 releases on September 14 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PC, and Switch. Pricing and a release schedule for the Kombat Pack haven't been revealed yet, but you can secure the six fighters above if you purchase the Premium or Kollector's Edition.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Think you can beat the ads?
Have you ever been absent-mindedly scrolling, or maybe watching YouTube, and been pulled in by the sudden and absurd interjection of a mobile game ad? Maybe even thought to yourself, 'hey, I can solve that.' Well, Yeah! You Want "Those Games," Right? So Here You Go! Now, Let's See You Clear Them! might be for you.
This collection is a video game that I'm going to shorthand down to Those Games, and it is indeed centered on 'those games': the kind of absurd logic problems that you see pop up over and over again in dime-a-dozen mobile game ads. Well, rather than download something that might be filled with extra transactions and bizarre stories, Those Games lets you have at it right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixmG35AhgFI
Climb the towers! Mix the solutions! Escape parking lots! Do...  I'm really not sure what you're doing in some of these, but you can certainly slide and tap your way through them. Those Games is on both PC via Steam and Nintendo Switch, for a fairly reasonable $9.99 at that.
Clear Those Games off
Interestingly enough, the developer behind this isn't just anybody. Studio Monkeycraft Co. Ltd. worked on the Klonoa Phantasy Reverie Series and Katamari Damacy HD updates. Seems like they did a pretty alright job, too.
Is this what we expected from the folks working on Klonoa and Katamari to move onto? Maybe not quite, but it's certainly whimsical and interesting. And now, I can finally see if I can pull all those slider bars right, to keep the puppy safe. Or clear the parking lot, or safely travel across a long walkway using only a giant stack of wooden beams. There's even a little gacha-style machine in there, for collecting titles. Guess you can't avoid every segment of mobile games, but at least there doesn't seem to be an energy meter in sight.

My Nintendo is cycling through icons yet again, and this time, it's Pikmin 4's time to shine. Well, the whole Pikmin series really, because while Oatchi (the adorable dog and mascot of the game) and a few Pikmin 4-exclusive art pieces are on full display, several also represent Pikmin in a general sense dating all the way back to the start of the franchise many moons ago.
Here's a look at what you can pick up!
[gallery link="file" columns="2" size="large" ids="392934,392935"]
Full list of all My Nintendo Pikmin icons
Ice Pikmin (Pose 1)
Ice Pikmin (Pose 2)
Yellow Pikmin (Carrying a cherry)
Blue Pikmin (On dice)
Red Pikmin (Carrying a button)
Oatchi (Pose 1)
Oatchi (Pose 2)
Winged Pikmin
Rock Pikmin
Purple Pikmin/White Pikmin
There are also five backgrounds and five frames to choose from.
More Pikmin icons are on the way
Note that this is just the first wave. Wave 2 is coming on July 27, and will run through August 3. Wave 3 will begin on that same day, and ends on August 10. Teases for that wave include Glow Pikmin, a Bulborb, and stylized Pikmin pictures.
I have a feeling Oatchi is going to be pretty popular! I wish Nintendo released data on which icons were the most purchased.

There is a terrifying, morbid curiosity that envelopes someone when they discover Pikmin gummy candies exist.
In her brilliant review of Pikmin 2, Destructoid’s Zoey “Stromboli” Handley discusses the empathic approach some take to the Pikmin series. Sure, the plant creatures in Nintendo’s franchise are disposable to an extent. But their tiny dying sounds and the little ghosts that fly away upon death fill me with deep sorrow. I planted those Pikmin. I plucked those Pikmin from the earth. And if I can’t keep them safe from the jaws of bizarre ladybug monsters, then did I even deserve their companionship to begin with? Every lost unit hurts my soul.

Diablo 4 Global Community Development Director Adam Fletcher didn't mince words in the recent Campfire Chat.
"We're telling you guys now that we completely hear you loud and clear," Fletcher commented. "We don't plan on doing patches like this ever again, where we're not going to be essentially removing the fun and the player power from players drastically."
Did anyone else have that on their bingo card? Fletcher was joined by Associate Game Director Joe Piepiora and Game Director Joe Shely to tackle this Campfire Chat.
I have to be honest, I overall feel torn. In a lot of ways, the trio said the right things. This was not a great patch, and they know it. They admitted a lapse in communication leading up to such a monumental patch. They clarified …]]></summary>

The video game documentarians at NoClip have been steadily preserving and archiving a wealth of old industry footage, ranging from tech demos and presentations to classic commercials. Importantly, the team is also getting higher definition captures of certain events than we've ever seen before, like a 1080p HD recording of the infamous Sony E3 2006 presentation.
For those who weren't around or closely watching the industry at the time, 2006 was an important year for Sony. Notably, the console maker was soaring on the success of the PlayStation 2. Kaz Hirai, president and CEO of Sony Computer Entertainment America at the time, took the stage to lay out the future ahead for both the PlayStation Portable and the impending launch of the PlayStation 3.

Madden NFL 24 brings new improvements to the FieldSense system, Franchise, Superstar, and even the skeletons of the on and off-field character models. Not only that but this year signals the return of the popular minigames that have been missing for many years. 
However, one of the biggest announcements each year comes in the form of the player ratings heading into the new season.

When I was a kid, trying out different games for my new-fangled N64, I didn’t know what to make of Mischief Makers. Games like Pilotwings 64 were blowing my mind with their explorable 3D worlds, and here was a completely 2D game that didn’t even use the analog stick. Beyond that, though, its aesthetic was like something I had never seen, and nothing about it made any sense to my young mind. I don’t think I made it far during that rental period.
Then, in college, I had a friend who adored Mischief Makers and gave me an entirely new perspective on the game. It still made no sense to me. It makes no sense to me now. I love the developer, the legendary Treasure, to the Moon and back, but Mischief Makers is one tough piece of meat to chew on.

Bandai Namco has just unveiled the next fighter returning for Tekken 8. Coming back after his introduction in Tekken 7 is Claudio Serafino, the closest we'll ever get to an Italian Final Fantasy protagonist.

Who is this literal godsend?
Claudio is the greatest exorcist in the world and de facto leader of the Archers of Sirius, an order of exorcists that I assume has been KO'ing demons for centuries. He entered Tekken lore in Tekken 7 as Heihachi Mishima contacted his group to get help against Devil Kazuya. Claudio reluctantly joined Heiachi's organization, but his tenure with Mishima Zaibatsu comes to a close by the end of the game as Heihachi believes he's finally gotten rid of Kazuya.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Out of Beta, into Early Access
The online Action RPG Wayfinder is almost ready for Early Access. After a handful of beta events, Digital Extremes announced Wayfinder will be hitting Early Access on August 15. Founder's Packs will be available in several tiers with each offering access to Wayfinder as well as two seasons of unique rewards. Of course, each founder's pack has its own separate cosmetic rewards as well. The ARPG will launch on both PC (Steam) and PlayStation with full cross-play and cross-save support.
Publisher Digital Extremes and developer Airship Syndicate also unveiled an all-new playable sharpshooter class called the Venomess: here's the trailer showing off the new class and announcing the upcoming Early Access.
https://youtu.be/0TdDWdfhAMU
An interactive Battle Pass that never expires
Each founder's pack will also grant you access to the Season 1 and 2 Reward Towers. This unique battle pass will allow you to choose your own path toward earning unique seasonal rewards. Unlocks from the Rewards Tower include exclusive characters, Sprays, Charms, pets, and other cosmetics. Interestingly, each season's Battle Pass in Wayfinder never expires allowing players to grind it out how they want and when they want.
I had the chance to play in the Wayfinders beta and it definitely shows some promise. The fast-paced combat felt quite satisfying. Also, the varying playstyles of each class provide the potential for true class identity and agency. Overall it was way too mission-based for my liking, but that's exactly what Waframe fans are accustomed to. The ability to team up with friends and blast through high-intensity action in an online setting is great, even if it's not quite MMO-like. Even Warframe opened up into the more traditional MMO experience over time, so perhaps Wayfinder will do its own twist with Airship Syndicate at the helm.
Wayfinder hits early access on PC (Steam) and PlayStation on August 15.

We'll also have every episode available the next day on our Game Informer Shows YouTube Channel (or you can watch the videos in the above playlist or by clicking the links below). 
Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts was released for the Xbox 360 on November 11, 2008. The third (and, so far, final) entry in Rare's beloved platforming series centers on vehicle creation, where players collect and slap together hundreds of parts to assemble their own wacky contraptions to explore. The bevy of possible combinations and emphasis on player choice and creativity was largely unprecedented at the time, paving the way for future games such as the upcoming The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. However, this direction would divide fans due to how much it strays from the traditional Banjo formula. So where will I land on it? Let's find out.
Join me, Marcus Stewart, alongside Kyle Hilliard as we explore one of the Xbox 360's biggest hidden gems to see whether it holds up or falls apart like a poorly constructed doohickey.

Blizzard will be addressing all the current Diablo 4 drama today in an aptly-timed Campfire Chat stream. The team confirmed that they plan to talk about the recent 1.1.0 patch that left fans unhappy with the current state of Diablo 4 and led to questions regarding the future of the popular Action RPG. I've read over your comments on various D4 posts in the last few days and want to welcome you in joining me around the campfire!
The Diablo 4 Campfire Chat will go live today at 11 a.m. PT / 2 p.m. ET. You can watch along on Twitch or YouTube. In the past, these Campfire Chats typically last between an hour and an hour and a half. There's definitely a lot to talk about, so I'd expect it to be on the longer end.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZuG4Yng4bY
What can we expect?
Most importantly, Diablo Global Community Development Director Adam Fletcher confirmed they plan to address player feedback regarding patch 1.1.0. There were so many changes in the recent update, so I highly doubt everything will be touched on in this stream. It's likely some of the more glaring issues like the experience and vulnerability changes will be discussed.
Also, with Diablo 4 season 1 releasing just yesterday I imagine there will be some discussion in regard to plans for the first post-season update.
I'll be sure to do a recap of the stream afterward as well. Hopefully, we'll all have some good news!
Update: Wow, what a Campfire Chat! Check out our recap of the stream here.

A license for Mega Mewtwo X is available now, as part of the Crystal Cave Challenge event that is currently taking place. The license for Mega Mewtwo Y will arrive in mid-august.
Players can fill Mewtwo's Mega gauge via basic attacks and moves. Once the gauge fills up, Mewtwo can Mega Evolve into Mega Mewtwo, gaining new attacks and increased stats before changing back into his normal form.
Mewtwo will join Zacian as the only Legendary Pokemon in Pokemon Unite. (Mew is in the game, but falls under the Mythical classification.) The Pokemon Company reiterated they plan to continue gradually increasing the number of Legendary Pokemon in Unite.

New battle type & Battle Pass 17
A new type of battle is also coming to Pokemon Unite as part of the Anniversary event. Panic Parade ditches the standard 5v5 battle format and tasks players with working together to protect Tinkaton from a horde of panicking Pokemon.
Battle Pass 17 is also live now and will run from July 21 until September 11. The primary rewards from the pass are Captain Style: Greeden and Captain Style: Zacian Holowear. There are also some Captain Set Trainer fashion items you can acquire from this season's pass.
The new ranked match season is also underway and will run through September 11. Players can also predict the top teams for the Pokemon World Championships 2023 and win some cool rewards for doing so.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's on the Epic Games Store now
The Elder Scrolls Online (ESO) is free on the Epic Games Store right now, and it's a pretty fantastic way to spend this semi-lull gaming period if you aren't getting Pikmin 4.
In case you were wondering, this is considered the "standard" edition of ESO and includes both the base game and the Morrowind chapter for $20. The "Necrom" version is $60 and adds in "all previous chapters," which at this point includes: High Isle, Blackwood, Greymoor, Elsweyr, Summerset, and Morrowind.
You can grab Elder Scrolls Online for free right here. This freebie promo will run through July 27 at 11AM ET, so you have time!
Is ESO worth playing?
Absolutely! Especially for free. Although it had its issues at launch, I thoroughly enjoyed running through and exploring this version of the Elder Scrolls universe, and it's only expanded since then with numerous quality-of-life patches. Although, you will have to buy/acquire the expansions that deal with content beyond the base game.
Does ESO have a mandatory subscription fee?
Nope! That's where this free offer comes in handy.
There is, however, an "ESO Plus Membership" that you can buy, which has become increasingly popular since Lord of the Rings Online (LOTRO) helped usher the scheme into the mainstream MMO scene ages ago.
Here's what it includes:
Access to all DLC game packs
Free crowns for the in-game Crown Store [read: microtransactions]
Access to the Craft Bag
Double bank space
Bonuses to progression
Increased Furniture placement limits
Costume dyeing
Double Transmute Crystal capacity
Exclusive access to unique Crown Store deals

Despite the wordplay in the title, the game is unexpectedly dark and violent, which is surprising considering the team's last game is about a cat on a Metroid-inspired mission. In any case, we like what we've played so far. Gunbrella is coming to PC and Switch some time this year.
Join Marcus Stewart and me as we check out some early gameplay and defeat the game's first boss.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not creepy in the horror sense
Wristwork has revealed their upcoming game about hungrily harvesting data called Faceminer. This is the sort of thing that makes me feel more uncomfortable than actual horror does.
Faceminer is set against the “techno-optimism” of the ‘90s. It puts you in front of a ‘90s-era operating system and has you go to work harvesting people’s biometric data. From there, you have to keep up with regulatory and technological demands as you navigate a corrupt bureaucratic system and continually upgrade your equipment. Buy and sell people’s personal data, just like a real tech company!
https://youtu.be/ntnYoBBsq14
Against the backdrop of white-knuckled multi-tasking, Faceminer sets itself up as a narrative game. You sift through emails and get to know other data scrapers in the business.
Even just with the trailers and information given, Faceminer looks like an evocative reflection of the disgustingly internet-driven world we live in. Information is a commodity, but it’s most valuable in large quantities. Everyone wants it, and everyone is taking it without asking to use or re-sell. It’s the true price of “free” information. You can’t be anonymous and access this data at the same time. I’ve learned to accept this as part of the society we live in, but I still hate it.
Anywho, we’ll see if Faceminer is a fun game or just an insightful one when it gets released, uh, hm… Soon. Eventually?

Or maybe because they just ended really damn well. Whatever the reasoning, join us as we ponder our favourite games that we’ve never returned to.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Based on the shooter series of the same name, the Borderlands film now has an official release date: August 9th, 2024. The action-comedy adaptation wrapped principal shooting in 2021, but it’s been somewhat stuck in post-production limbo ever since with several rounds of reshoots pushing out the release further than expected. 


This comes after reports that co-writer Craig Mazin - best known as the showrunner behind HBO’s The Last Of Us and Chornobyl - removed his name from the project in favour of a pseudonym. More recently, Mazin confirmed to Variety that the pen name reports were false and he’s instead “not a credited writer” on Borderlands at all anymore. Mazin is instead focusing on The Last Of Us’ second season.


The Borderlands was mostly directed by Eli Roth, known for his work on the Hostel films and Cabin Fever. Roth was reportedly busy during reshoots, however, so studio Lionsgate enlisted the help of Tim Miller, the director behind Deadpool, to helm the project for a few weeks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[These bikes don't work over water unless you've got POWER!
Akupara Games has announced that they’ll be publishing Videocult’s upcoming lo-fi hoverbike game, Airframe Ultra.
Unless you count all the rust, Airframe Ultra is quite a departure from Videocult’s previous game, Rain World. In this one, you ride around on a hoverbike, winning races and eliminating the competition. While the trailer gives a good long look at the gameplay, both it and the press release I got with it suggest that there’s still much to do in establishing the mechanics of the game. For one thing, you never really see a starting grid or finish line. There’s also combat intermingled with what otherwise looks like racing.
https://youtu.be/KNgKB6TbA_4
It looks like Videocult is focused on getting the feel of the hoverbike right and then working from there. You can really tell how much effort has gone into the animations and physics of the game, as the rider leans and the weight shifts on the bike. It’s also interesting how you can plant your weapon in the ground to enable quick turns.
Really, while a lot is left to be seen in regards to gameplay, what has been shown is enough to get me interested in Airframe Ultra. I used to love Jet-Moto when I was younger, and the hoverbikes remind me of that. Meanwhile, the lo-fi early-3D aesthetic and CRT filter, along with the cyberpunk environments really speak to me. I guess I just love filth.
Another thing missing from the press materials is a release date. Right now, we only know that Airframe Ultra is coming to Steam.

What's the opposite of a speedrun? A "slowrun," perhaps? If you want a Resident Evil challenge that requires you to clear your schedule for the next couple of days, this could be what you're looking for. You see, it turns out the 1998 Resident Evil 2 can actually be completed from start to finish without walking at all.
This was proved by Twitch streamer and speedrunner Punchy (as spotted by PCGamesN). In an edited video uploaded to YouTube recently, they give a commentary on this unique challenge, which saw them get to the end credits of Resident Evil 2 without taking a physical step. While this video is a 40-minute highlight of the run itself, Punchy shows in the closing moments how long it took them to achieve this: 13 hours and 34 minutes!

There's a time-travelling detective story at the heart of it, in which you and a very Minority Report-style AI work together to stop crimes that will disrupt the one true timeline throughout history, and it's all played out on gorgeous black and white tableaus like Adriaan de Jongh's wonderful Hidden Folks. You'll rewind and fast forward time to plot suspicious movements, track stolen objects as they move across town, and work out who (or what) is causing all this chaos. I'm having good fun with it, but I do wish it would stop whisking me away from its lovely maps to go and complete yet another tedious mini-game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Asus ROG Ally has once again made itself impossible to write about without also mentioning the Steam Deck. Its latest BIOS update - out now via the MyAsus app – includes a fix that allows the handheld Windows PC to correctly run in its fastest, power-hungriest Turbo mode when connected to sufficiently high-wattage, third-party docking stations and USB-C hubs. In other words, it now works with more of the best Steam Deck docks.

This anime is the one replacing the long-running Pokémon anime that recently wrapped up after 25 seasons of pocket monster adventures. Horizons features new protagonists, Liko and Roy, who are joined by Friede, the Professor of this series, alongside Captain Pikachu. In this new English-dubbed trailer, we see Liko and her Sprigatito, Roy and his Fuecoco, Friede and Captain Pikachu, and plenty of other Pokémon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Steam Sim Fest is the latest genre-specific event, discounting dozens of games about emerging cities, dad hobbies, tactical warfare, and other stimulating simulations. Heavy hitters such as Disney Dreamlight Valley and the newest Bus Simulator are enjoying nice discounts, but as always, some hidden gems require a little bit of scrolling. The sales last until July 24th, so here are some good old recommendations from the event.


Surprise! Lakeburg Legacies is a hybrid between village management and mediaeval matchmaking , and it’s out now with a 15% sale bringing the price down to £16.50/$19.50. Love is almost as hard-to-manage as the economy, but worry not, a soothing storybook aesthetic should make this one slightly less stressful than couple’s therapy and/or mayoral duties. 


Wobbly person sim Human: Fall Flat has a hefty 70% discount and is currently £4.80/$6.50. To celebrate the puzzle-platformer’s seventh anniversary, the team are also sharing some mysterious news tomorrow. That’s in addition to a new level coming in August, so look forward to more clumsy flailing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I can't remember the last time I struggled so much to get through a game.
You misunderstand. I'm not saying ΔV: Rings Of Saturn is a chore or grind. I found it hard because any time I boot it up, I can get lost for hours just playing it. Not trying to win, not following the story, not looking for (ugh) "progression". Just mining, exploring, idly drifting through the void. It is a game I don't want to exhaust because I'm enjoying it too much. I went back in "for a quick dive" twice during this intro.
It doesn't have Content. It's not one of those compulsive, manipulative forever games. You could barge efficiently through it, finding probably all its secrets and items as fast as possible. That wouldn't be wrong, exactly, but it's missing the point: this is a game to be savoured, not consumed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Another week means more freebies are available from the Epic Games Store, and this week two very different games have slashed their price tags. Starting today, The Elder Scrolls Online and Murder By Numbers are both free to keep from the digital store. Something for multiplayer dragon slayers and solo picross lovers alike. 

 
The Elder Scrolls Online is, well, The Elder Scrolls but online. The long-running MMO has been unlocking doors into every corner of Tamriel, most recently with the Necrom expansion’s otherworldly tentacles and massive mushrooms. It's good at accommodating solo players who are looking to scratch a Skyrim-sized itch - since the next Elder Scrolls is at least five years away. That approachability got the game into our list of the ten best MMOs on PC. 


On the other end of the humanities versus maths spectrum, we have Murder By Numbers, a murder mystery visual novel where you complete picross puzzles to further the investigation. Plus there's a robo-friend who pulls out a monocle every now and then, which is just plain cute. AliceB said the game was “worth a poke around if you’re a fan of either genre involved,” in our Murder By Numbers review. Even though neither half “are given enough space to breathe,” it should be worth a try for the affordable price of zero pence, though.

        <updated>2023-07-20T16:36:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Much has been made about Armored Core VI Fires of Rubicon’s mech-based gameplay, but a new trailer shines a light on its narrative. To the surprise of no one, though, this new look still packs in plenty of cinematic action. 
Despite the "VI" in the title, Fire of Rubicon serves as a reboot. The game unfolds on planet Rubicon in which its most sought-after resource, Coral, was the cause of a disaster that engulfed the planet in flames. Decades later, the now-contaminated planet has been condemned, but the rediscovery of Coral has attracted various factions, sparking a new war on the destroyed world. Players control mercenary C4-621 or "Raven" for short, who is thrown into this epic struggle pitting megacorporations, military forces, and other groups against each other. Based on the trailer's somber tone, it won't be pretty. 


Armored Core VI Fires of Rubicon launches on August 25 for PlayStation/Xbox consoles and PC. You can learn more by checking out our recent cover story.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It is a truth universally acknowledged that when aliens threaten to exterminate your home, only the world's most insufferable, unhinged scientists can help you save the day. XCOM knows it, and now Xenonauts 2 is following suit. Case in point, yer man up the top there. Look at that smug mullet and his unimpressed raised eyebrow. He doesn't give two hoots you're here to save the world from extinction, leading (probably several) teams of nine (unwitting) brave souls into the unknown (i.e.: repeated death by alien overwatch). He's got research to do. Organs to pickle. Dead alien carcasses to splice. Yeah, the same ones you literally strapped into your troops' tactical belts in the last mission so you could bring them home. We had stinking brain monsters wrapped round our torsos, guy! The least you can do is deign to make us a nice cuppa when we get back. Honestly. You can't get the staff these days...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Despite launching in less than a month, we haven’t seen too much of Atlas Fallen since it was revealed nearly a year ago. A general overview video released last month gave curious players a primer on what to expect from this world of sand, magic, and monsters. Publisher Focus Entertainment has followed that up with a new gameplay-focused video breaking down the game’s combat.
The five-minute video shows off the action RPG's sand-shaping action. Players can equip two main weapons to alternate attacks in fast-paced combat. These include arms like a whip, axe, and even giant fists made of sand. Attacks build momentum, which raises your power and can be spent to unleash flashy special attacks. However, the higher your momentum, the more damage you take, promoting a strategic risk/reward system.


The video also provides a look at customization, showing off Essence Stones. There are over 150 of these skills, which range from aerial attacks to setting traps to firing projectiles. The trailer also shows off the game’s two-player online co-op. Two players can complete Atlas Fallen, including its story campaign, in its entirety together. In fact, the video states some Essence Stones promote cooperative play. 
Atlas Fallen looks promising, and developer Deck13 has a decent track record (The Surge series, Lords of the Fallen), so we hope this information dump at the eleventh hour is a sign of confidence instead of a bad omen. We look forward to seeing how it shapes up when it arrives on August 10 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I thought Exoprimal somehow managed to make dinosaurs versus mechs, aka the coolest concept ever, boring in my review-in-progress. I held out hope it would improve, though, as lots of commenters assured me it's fun side would finally surface. "Just play several more hours and things really open up! Variety in the dinos, in the modes, in just about everything!". To some extent, they were right. There are fun moments to be had as you queue up for Dino Survival and suddenly, remarkably, things have changed a bit.
But the game doesn't respect your time. It forces you to sit through hours of repetitive dino-slaying and then only offers you the chance, the chance to slay dinos in a way that isn't excruciatingly samey. Even as someone who finds the fun in mindless carnage, I'd much rather ditch my mech suit and let the dinosaurs run rampant. The dinosaurs don't deserve this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gundam Evolution, the competitive multiplayer title set within the popular Gundam universe, is shutting down.
Despite launching less than a year ago in September 2022, executive producer Kazuya Maruyama shared in a blog post that support for the game will be winding down, though he doesn't provide any specifics as to why.  
“We wanted to create a title that brought FPS fans and Gundam fans together," Maruyama writes. "We challenged ourselves to create an authentic Gundam FPS game that could be played globally. Unfortunately, we have determined that it is no longer possible for us to provide a service that satisfies our players.”
A livestream detailing the sunsetting roadmap will air tomorrow, July 21 at 11 p.m. PT. Gundam Evolution’s services officially end on November 29. Until then, Maruyama states that it will still receive updates. Season 6 arrives on August 23, and the final season hits on October 25. Both seasons will introduce a new unit and maps. 
Today, the following services will be suspended:
Ending sales of EVO Coins
Ending sales of EC Pod Limited
Ending updates to EC Pods, CAP Pods, and Ticket Pods
Gundam Evolution was announced at a PlayStation State of Play in March 2022. The FPS title lets players suit up as their favorite mobile suits to battle in 6v6 matches across various game modes. Unfortunately, it now joins the growing list of multiplayer titles that closed their doors this year, which includes Final Fantasy VII: The First Soldier, Babylon's Fall, Rumbleverse, Apex Legends Mobile, and Knockout City.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Might & Magic: Clash Of Heroes was one of those Nintendo DS games that I never played at the time but had always heard was very good. Its unusual triple-decker sandwich of strategic, match-three RPG puzzling hasn't really been replicated in the fifteen-odd years since it first came out, unless you count its own HD remaster that came out in 2011. Alas, with that version now having gone off sale on PC in favour of this further spruced up Definitive Edition, this is now the best and only way to play it. Originally developed by the same core team at Capybara Games that went on to make the excellent Grindstone, this Definitive Edition has been handled entirely by remake house Dotemu, and yep, I now see what all the fuss is about. However, I also have quite a lot of reservations about it. For all its clear, obvious brilliance, it's also a very hard game to love. Because it really is very hard, and I still can't quite decide if I'm having fun or not.

Then again, given the mild horror themes in many of the levels and the general terror the excellent enemy design invokes, you probably shouldn’t be playing it around kids in the first place. As a fan of this sequel’s predecessor, Remnant: From The Ashes, I had my hopes set unreasonably high, and not only has Remnant II completely met my expectations, but it also kept messing around with what I thought I should be expecting. It left me in a constant state of awe. This is a furiously ambitious follow-up and has everything I could have ever wanted.

Mortal Kombat creator and director of MK1, Ed Boon, tweeted yesterday what fans can expect at the SDCC panel, “Resetting Mortal Kombat: A New Beginning With Mortal Kombat 1,” tomorrow, and it’s going to be perhaps the most significant drop of new information we’ve received for the game yet. Boon says MK1 voice actors will be there alongside NetherRealm Studios developers to tell the “making of” story of the game. Plus, there will be three new MK1 trailers during the panel, including gameplay and a “surprise.” 
Mortal Kombat fans at San Diego Comic-Con. Wanna see a TON of new #MortalKombat1 stuffs?

July 20, 2023
As for when, the “Resetting Mortal Kombat” SDCC panel begins tomorrow, July  21, at 3:15 p.m. PT and lasts one full hour, ending at 4:15 p.m. PT. If you’re ready for new Mortal Kombat 1 footage, be sure to tune in!
MK1 was announced two months ago with a teaser trailer indicating the wider Mortal Kombat universe has been completely reset (hence the “1” in the title). The following month, in June, NetherRealm released our first look at MK1 gameplay with a trailer that featured new looks at the roster, story details, the reveal of Kameo fighters, and more. 
During Summer Game Fest, we went hands-on with it that same month and had a blast with the Kameo fighters and gory and fun fighting action. You can check out some of that action in our MK1 New Gameplay Today here. 
The latest news NetherRealm released about MK1 was a trailer earlier this month revealing Smoke and Rain in the game’s fighter roster. And tomorrow, we’ll receive more information, including three trailers. 
Mortal Kombat 1 hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC on September 19.
Are you tuning in tomorrow to learn more about Mortal Kombat 1? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Activision Blizzard has laid off around 50 employees, according to a new report from The Verge. 
This news arrives the same day Activision Blizzard released its Fiscal Year 2023 Q2 results, which highlights a murky future for the company’s esports efforts despite an otherwise financially successful quarter for the Overwatch 2 maker. Activision Blizzard’s results show that net bookings grew 50% year-over-year in the second quarter, from $1.64 billion to $2.46 billion, due to a lucrative Diablo IV launch, an increase in revenue from various franchises, mobile growth, and more. But, despite that growth, the company laid off around 50 employees in Blizzard’s esports department, Activision Blizzard esports senior director of global communication Brad Crawford confirmed to Game Informer.

In a blog post, Blizzard explains it wants to expand its reach to players beyond its proprietary PC launcher. It believes the free-to-play Overwatch 2 is the best game to kick off this major shift in its PC release strategy. There’s currently no word on what other Blizzard games are coming to Steam, but the publisher says it will announce them “when the time is right.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Join Wesley LeBlanc, Marcus Stewart, and Kyle Hilliard as we discuss The Crew Motorfest, Ubisoft's upcoming threequel in its open-world racing series that began back in 2014 with The Crew. Wesley played roughly four hours of the game in a hands-on remote preview to learn more about its open world Oahu, Hawaii, various vehicles, racing playlists, Main Stage mode, and more. 
Enjoy more than 15 minutes of new gameplay from The Crew Motorsport in the latest NGT below: 


Ubisoft Ivory Tower developed both 2014's The Crew and 2018's The Crew 2, and the Lyon, France-based studio returns to developer The Crew Motorfest. Unlike the first two games in the series, which feature maps spanning the entire United States, The Crew Motorfest takes place in just one state: Hawaii. The island of Oahu, Hawaii, to be specific, and it features Honolulu, plenty of beautiful beaches, mountain paths to drift through, and more. 
In our NGT for The Crew Motorfest, we showcase some gameplay from the Vintage Garage playlist, which is a racing playlist devoted to vintage cars from as far back as the 1950s, the Made in Japan playlist, which is all about Japanese street racing, and a boat race on the ocean surrounding the island. 
For more about The Crew Motorfest, read Game Informer's full preview here. 
The Crew Motorfest hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on September 14, 2023. 
For more previews and discussions of some of the biggest games of 2023 and beyond, be sure to head over to our YouTube page for NGTs about Ra Ra Boom, Double Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons, Mortal Kombat 1, Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, XDefiant, and Sea of Stars.

This is the lowest price we've spotted for AMD's fastest GPU since it launched last year and a great deal for a card that originally retailed for north of £999. 
This particular model is the Asus Tuf Gaming OC design, which has been well-rated for its thermal efficiency and performance. However, this is a big card, so it's worth checking its dimensions (352.9 x 158.2 x 72.6mm) versus your case to ensure that it will fit, especially in smaller Micro ATX or Mini ATX enclosures.

The Crew, Ubisoft’s racing franchise akin to Microsoft’s Forza series and EA’s Need For Speed, has been around for nearly a decade. And since its inception, it has struggled to make a cultural dent in the racing genre, despite sales greenlighting a sequel and, now, a threequel in The Crew Motorfest. I went into a four-hour, hands-on remote preview of Motorfest, hoping to feel something different about this series. But, like The Crew 2 and The Crew before it, Motorfest feels uninspired, even if still a competent racer.

Unique Items are the highest tier of loot you can obtain in Diablo IV – I beat the campaign last night after 28 hours and only just received my first piece of Unique gear. They feature excellent stat boosts and unique bonus effects and are tailor-made for specific builds. There…]]></summary>

More specifically, Activision Blizzard and Microsoft have jointly agreed to extend the merger agreement from July 18 to October 18, 2023, giving both companies roughly three months to sort through this purchase. As for why, Microsoft says it is “to allow for additional time to resolve remaining regulatory concerns.” 
Microsoft vice chair and president Brad Smith tweeted, “Together with Activision, we are announcing the extension of our merger agreement to 10/18 to provide ample time to work through final regulatory issues. We will honor all commitments agreed upon with the EC and othe regulators and continue to work with the CMS on the issues raised in the UK.

Pikmin has always held a strange spot in Nintendo’s library of games and franchises. Its creation is credited to Mario and Zelda’s dad, Shigeru Miyamoto, which means Nintendo holds it in high esteem, but it has never quite reached the cultural ubiquity of his other works. And maybe it’s unfair to compare the adorable strategy game about dragging the corpses of defeated foes into your spaceship to the iconic plumber and the Hero of Time, but Pikmin 4 might be the one that moves the series closer to those legacies. It represents a high point for Pikmin, thanks in large part to Oatchi, the helpful dog th…]]></summary>

That’s why Astroneer won me over with its more chilled take on the not-so-chill genre. But for those who enjoy the scary parts of space, Astroneer can now be turned into that hardcore survival experience. Or anything else you want.

"The script is the equivalent of twelve movies," Interior/Night's CEO and creative director Caroline Marchal tells me. "Twelve hundred pages of script. It's big, it's very big." As the team developed that script through countless drafts, they did frequent writer's rooms across three years for As Dusk Falls, but with frequent plot changes, backyard trailer shoots and the sheer grind of making it to the finish line, Marchal and studio director Charu Desodt reflect on just how ambitious it was for the studio's debut game.

In other words, Lisa was a bit of a cult classic thanks to its freaky world, absurd humour, and brutal consequences. And when I say brutal consequences, I mean your party members can permanently lose limbs or turn into mounds of saggy flesh. How’s that for a debuff? Its Definitive Edition is out now, though, so maybe its "cult" status will finally blossom into mainstream appeal. Lisa: Definitive Edition bundles in the original game and its expansion, Lisa The Joyful, as well as new enemies, bosses, stories and endings, and an easier “Painless” mode.

Turns out there’s plenty more, as port developers Nixxes Software have used a  Sony blog post to detail quite a few new tech toys – including Rift Apart’s Microsoft DirectStorage 1.2 support.
DirectStorage is simultaneously one of the most exciting recent developments in gaming hardware, and one of the most underutilised: it basically adapts your PC’s process for reading data from an SSD or hard drive in a way that can massively reduce game loading times, but has so far only made it to prime time in Forspoken. I suppose the upside is that once Rift Apart is out on July 26th, DirectStorage’s compatible games list will increase by 100%?

Sonic Superstars is a modernized 2D adventure with four-player co-op, which you’ll need to utilize to play as Sonic the Hedgehog, Tails, Knuckles, and Amy. Its announcement was one of the biggest surprises of Summer Game Fest, and after getting to go hands-on with it during SGF’s Play Days event, we came away excited about the blue blur’s latest adventure. 
Now, Sega has released the game's opening animation. Check it out for yourself below: 


As you can see, Sonic Superstars features a Sonic CD-esque opening, with its bright blue skies and emerald green plains. After dashing through some enemies, Sonic joins his buddy Tails before teaming up with the rest of the Sonic Superstars playable cast, Knuckles and Amy. Together, the four prepare to take Eggman on before speeding toward the screen. 
The trailer ends with the news that if you preorder the game, you’ll receive an “exclusive Lego Eggman in-game character skin, acrylic display stand, and reversible cover.” This preorder bonus will go great with the other Lego Sonic Superstars skins coming to the game as DLC. 
Sega has yet to reveal a release date for Sonic Superstars but it’s due out sometime this fall on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.
While waiting to learn more, read about how Microsoft, at one point, considered acquiring Sega, and then read about why we think Sonic’s latest outing, Sonic Origins Plus, is two steps forward and one step back. 
Are you picking up Sonic Superstars on day one? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I never thought I'd hear the words 'roguelite' and 'Minesweeper' together in the same sentence but here we are. Let's! Revolution! is a joyous mix of both Minesweeper and a roguelite, tasking players with hunting down a deliciously repugnant king through a series of increasingly complex tile maps to enact their titular coup. With all tiles facing down on arrival, you'll need to hop from square to square to flip them over and reveal the king's hiding place before progressing to the next level. But with several of his royal agents stalking the roads and highways, you'll need to choose your route carefully, making good use of your character's unique set of skills to arrive at your final destination of Beebom City. That, and employing a bit of the old Minesweeper noggin, of course. 
You see, tiles come in two types in Let's! Revolution! The aforementioned road tiles, and surrounding landscape tiles. The latter all have numbers denoting how many road tiles surround it, giving you just enough information to build up a picture of where the road (and the king's lackeys) might be lurking. Take care, though. This lot are a tricksy bunch, and can quite quickly overwhelm if they're revealed too soon and all at once. That's Let's! Revolution! in a nutshell, at least, but the real joy of this run-based rogue comes from its gorgeous presentation and its brilliantly conceived character classes that twist and mould its basic building blocks into fresh new forms each and every time. It's great fun, and I can't get enough of it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Unpacking is, for the most part, a laid-back puzzle game. I’ve had a cosy ol’ time taking out all the protagonist's items one by one and placing them in the various places around her rooms. From her childhood bedroom right up until her first house, I love how relaxing and gratifying it is to decorate each room. But after replaying it for this month's RPS Game Club, there’s one section that gave me quite the opposite reaction.
A big part of Unpacking is learning about the character’s personalities through their objects: what clothes they have in their wardrobes, what items fill their bookshelves, which kitchen utensils make it from move to move, and so on. These contextual clues act as a subtle but incredibly effective story-telling device. There is one level, however, where it’s not all laid-back fun times and it's when the protagonist moves in with her first partner, who I will henceforth be referring to as ‘finance bro boyfriend’ - and wow, he is the absolute worst. Spoilers ahead for those who have not played Unpacking.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I think back on most of the cinematic platformers I've played recently, it's not the latter part of their genre title I remember most, but the former. The lush camera pans of your Planet Of Lanas, the haunting backdrops of your Somervilles and the gooey, malleable monstrosities of your Insides. These dramatic moments linger in the memory much longer than their respective running and jumping, and if it's a proper platforming challenge I'm after, I usually look elsewhere, swapping cinema for action with your Raymans, Trines and Oris. 
Full Void, on the other hand, is a cinematic run and jumper that manages to strike a good balance between both parts of its personality. Following in the Another World school of gorgeous pixel art meets one-foot-wrong-and-you're-dead-style platforming (albeit with much more generous checkpointing than its 1991 source material), there's a real athleticism in your teen hero's journey to bring down a despotic AI, making its intricate leaps and bounds just as memorable as its down-to-the-wire set pieces.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Ryzen 5 7600X processor might be one of AMD's cheapest options in their Zen 4 lineup, but this chip is still hugely powerful compared to prior Ryzen generations. It takes advantage of its 5nm process and the AM5 socket to hit higher clock speeds, has architectural improvements that raise its single-core prowess, and of course has access to DDR5 memory and PCIe 5.0 add-in cards too. That's made it a strong option for gaming, but a high asking price of $300 at launch - plus expensive motherboards and DDR5 - put it out of reach of most sane budget builds. That's slowly changing as these chips and other components become cheaper, and today the 7600X has hit a new low price in the US: just $200 at Amazon.com, a full $100 off its MSRP and a great deal for a processor with this kind of performance.

It looks like that restrained approach will extend to its post-launch content too, with its devs saying that they don’t currently have any plans to extend the game after release with DLC or other expansions.

The sci-fi racing game was a classic on the original PlayStation. Its PC release? Not so much. But now one fan has decided to do right by the almost 30-year-old title by releasing a remastered Phantom Edition that finally brings WipeOut’s original PC release in line with its beloved PlayStation version.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft have announced that a new Game Pass tier will replace Xbox Live Gold on consoles. The new Xbox Game Pass Core tier will cost £7/$10 for a monthly subscription and £50/$60 for an annual one. Microsoft haven’t announced plans to bring Game Pass Core to PC players, although the new tier costs almost the same amount as the (frankly much better value) PC Game Pass variant - for now, at least.


Starting on September 14th, Xbox Live Gold subscribers will be automatically converted to Game Pass Core, which allows access to online multiplayer, exclusive discounts, and a compact collection of games. Xbox’s monthly freebie program Games With Gold is also getting axed, although you can still play previously redeemed games as long as you’re subscribed to either the Core or Ultimate tiers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft has revealed Xbox Game Pass Core, a new subset of Xbox Game Pass that will replace the long-running Xbox Live Gold program this September. 
Xbox Live changed the industry more than two decades ago with its multiplayer network features, but the program’s premier Xbox Live Gold has waned in popularity for the past few years, likely due to a lack of compelling free games to download. Now, Xbox is ending Xbox Live Gold on September 14 and replacing it with Xbox Game Pass Core. This new subscription tier of Xbox Game Pass will cost $9.99 per month, or $59.99 a year, and serves as an evolution of Xbox Live Gold, according to the company.

Last week, California Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley denied the FTC's request for a preliminary injunction in its case to block Microsoft and Xbox from acquiring the Call of Duty maker. The FTC sought this preliminary injunction to have the court order the tech giant to cease its attempt at acquiring Activision Blizzard for a colossal $69 billion. Following the court ruling, the FTC had until July 14 to file an appeal and it did so on July 12.

Perspective is key because here's the thing: this is a world where you can bring photos to life, the 2D image becoming a 3D reality when you place it within the puzzle world.
It's an incredible hook and one which I've never seen in a puzzle game before. There are echoes of The Witness, Gorogoa, and Superliminal here, but Viewfinder's dizzyingly mind-melting puzzles are still very much its own. It impresses from the get-go and continues to pull tricks out of its silky tophat right until the end of its four hour run time. It's compact, brilliant, and one of the best puzzle games of 2023.

Viewfinder is all about playing with your perception and giving you the tools to do so yourself. It belongs to the difficult-to-define sub-genre of video games popularized by Portal, where you have access to a mind-blowing ability in order to solve puzzles. The danger with giving the player these kinds of god tools to get them to their destination is sometimes the well of creativity can run dry by the end, or it all just gets so complicated that the fun disappears. Viewfinder thankfully falls into neither of these traps, presenting a series of engaging puzzles that frequentl…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Adibou, the first game in the beloved children's series, is now ready for public testing!
Also known as Adi Jr.'s World of Discoveries, this 1991 Coktel Vision title began the educational Adibou collection aimed at children of age 4 to 7 years.
Many of the iconic activities and mechanisms of the series were already part of this first opus: planting flowers, playing the game Breakout, and being rewarded with sweets upon completing Read/Count exercises. And of course, this was Adibou's first appearance! Although the floppy release has him speak the same strange gibberish as heard in the Goblins series, he is still the patient and funny learning partner that he's remembered for being in later games.
ScummVM supports all of the game's releases, from the initial 16-color floppy ones to later 1994 CD versions with richer graphics and sound effects. So dig out your dusty Adibou disks, get a ScummVM daily development build, and start collecting sweets while completing math and reading exercises! Please also contact us if you own a version ScummVM is not yet aware of, and report to the issue tracker any problem you may encounter.
As much as ScummVM aims to replicate the original gaming experience, there is one feature we are unfortunately unable to support. When hardworking children complete their virtual sweets collection, a message invites them to mail a floppy disk with their savegame to Coktel Vision, who would send them a parcel containing Coktel goodies and actual sweets! So if you are introducing children to Adibou through ScummVM, be prepared to go to the nearest shop and buy some candy for when they finish the game!

We normally focus on the upper end of the spectrum, but today we're featuring an entry-level 27-inch 1440p model that's able to deliver excellent image quality, wide viewing angles, a higher-than-normal 75Hz refresh rate and  superior ergonomics thanks to a nice stand. All that for £175 - not bad, right? 
To get this price, you'll need to sign up for Dell's newsletter to get a 5% off code, then use it with another code - TELEGRAPH5MON - at the checkout. That brings this £259 monitor down to £175, complete with a three-year warranty and free delivery.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fun as it is to pose as an expert on everything, I am not the best judge when it comes to the old psychojalimical horror. Which may be why I don't quite know how I feel about Decarnation.
There's a big content warning needed here for sexual assault, something that I assumed would turn out to be the whole point of the game. An unfair judgement, it turns out, as one of its strengths is the intriguing mystery of what's actually going on, not the more common "what traumatic thing is everything a metaphor for".
Protagonist Gloria has a lot going on, see. She's a talented cabaret dancer who recently modelled for a statue, for an artist who immediately makes some creepy remarks about how she's an ugly old hag at 29. Misogyny and self image are at the heart of this, but they're wrapped up in Gloria's worries about getting older, chasing intimacy with a new lover, and her deep love for dance, an art form that games so rarely do much with. It's not an ugly or blunt game, despite its distressing themes, and I think that's why it works for me overall.

In this case, the Emmys, where it’s up for no less than two dozen awards.

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2023/07/14/stray-gods-the-role-playing-musical-release-date-delayed-one-week"/>
        <updated>2023-07-14T13:30:48.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stray Gods: The Role-Playing Musical has been delayed by one week. 
Initially due out on August 3, the musical RPG will now hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on August 10. As for why, publisher Humble Games and developer Summerfall Studios says it is taking the extra week to work on performance parity across all platforms and to allow players the space to play Larian Studios’ upcoming RPG, Baldur’s Gate 3. 


Here’s what Humble Games and Summerfall Studios have to say about the Stray Gods delay: 
For the uninitiated, Stray Gods is a hand-illustrated role-playing musical where players will decide lines in songs, similar to picking dialogue choices in an RPG. The music is composed by Grammy-nominated composer Austin Wintory (Journey, The Pathless, Assassin’s Creed Syndicate), Tripod, and Montaigne. 
These songs are performed by a cast filled with names you might recognize, too, like Troy Baker, Ashley Johnson, Rahul Kohli, Janina Gavankar, Felicia Day, and more.

In April, the CMA blocked this acquisition over cloud gaming concerns, making Microsoft’s fight for the green light in this acquisition more challenging. But it shifted its sights on the Federal Trade Commission in the U.S. afterward, with plans to appeal the CMA’s ruling in the meantime. 


Earlier this week, California Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley denied the FTC’s request for a preliminary injunction in its case to block Microsoft and Xbox from acquiring Activision Blizzard. Shortly after that decision, Microsoft announced it paused its appeal efforts in the U.K. to negotiate with the CMA. The deadl…]]></summary>

The move away from the FIFA license was announced last year, and today, we got our first look at this year's EA Sports soccer title.
The big pitch this year from EA Sports is around its advanced technology. EA's proprietary Frostbite engine returns, but with enhancements, including the new Sapien character model skeletons first introduced through our Madden NFL 24 coverage last month. The skeleton ensures that players look more true to life when standing still but also in motion, making for more realistic movement that affects both the game's visuals and gameplay.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Clock Tower series is a favorite among horror game aficionados, but the first game has never been released outside of Japan. That finally changes as the 1995 classic is getting spruced up for a modern, international re-release.
For any Americans thinking, “But we got the first Clock Tower on PlayStation,” we actually didn’t. The 1997 game known as “Clock Tower,” which did release in the West, was really Clock Tower 2 and was titled as such in Japan (watch us play it in this classic episode of Replay).
The actual first game arrived on Super Famicom (SNES) and stars Jennifer Simpson, an orphan adopted by the Barrows family only to find that a murderous stalker called the Scissorman is terrorizing their mansion. As a point-and-click adventure, you use a mouse cursor to guide Jennifer and interact with your surroundings to solve puzzles and find clues while evading the Scissorman. The game also features multiple endings. Clock Tower is considered one of the forefathers of survival horror and has been ported to different platforms, such as PC and the Wii/Wii U eShops, several times in Japan. 


Wayforward is handling this port, which is being made using Limited Run Games’ Carbon Engine. As discussed in the developer diary video above, improvements include the game's first official English localization (along with multiple language options), a new animated intro, motion-comic cutscenes, and a new vocalized theme song by famed anime and Silent Hill singer Mary McGlynn. It also includes an art gallery, save states, and other modern tweaks. 
Clock Tower is coming early next year for PlayStation and Xbox consoles, Switch, and PC. Limited Run Games is also releasing premium physical versions of the game.]]></summary>

The survival genre is one that’s never entirely worked for me. Life is already stressful enough, and playing a game built on the idea of stress, resource management, and, well, survival has never appealed to me in my off-hours. But Keen Games, the studio behind Portal Knights, let me watch roughly an hour of gameplay of its new survival game Enshrouded behind closed doors, and I came away excited about everything it’s doing to alleviate the stresses of the genre. 
Keen Games describes Enshrouded as an open-world survival action RPG set in a post-apocalyptic fantasy world drowned by a mysterious fog. You play as a unique person brought back to life by a powerful force called The Flame. From there…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Join Wesley LeBlanc, Marcus Stewart, and Kyle Hilliard as we discuss Ra Ra Boom, an upcoming beat 'em up headed to PC in early 2024. Wesley played through the demo multiple times, using each character to take down AI and robots alike. He, Marcus, and Kyle discuss the game's visual style, use of lanes in combat, fully-voiced characters, and more. 
Enjoy roughly 12 minutes of all new Ra Ra Boom gameplay in the latest NGT below: 


In 2008, Chris Bergman, who later co-founded Gylee Games and now works as its CEO, bought the domain to raraboom.com. Today, that site takes you to the Steam page for Ra Ra Boom, the beat 'em up featured in our latest installment of New Gameplay Today. Gylee Games started work on the game back in 2019, before the resurgence of beat 'em up games, but Bergman is stoked about said resurgence. He calls it a "rising tides raise all ships" scenario. 
After playing through this demo multiple times, I'm excited for Ra Ra Boom's full release. Its inclusion of lanes has fixed my largest problem with beat 'em ups: my inability to properly target and hit enemies. Add in the fully voiced characters, beautiful art style, fun cast of ninja cheerleaders, and an emphasis on story that's somewhat rare in the genre, and I'm ready to smash some robots. 
Ra Ra Boom hits PC early next year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden is an upcoming action RPG from Don’t Nod, makers of Life is Strange and Vampyr, which was first revealed at The Game Awards last December. The upcoming ghost-busting adventure has a new trailer revealing a November 7 launch date. 
The game stars Antea Duarte and Red mac Raith, two lovers who serve as Banishers, those who protect the living from the lingering spirits of the dead. Unfortunately, Antea has become a ghost herself and must work alongside Red to find a way to bring herself back to life. Along the way, they’ll explore New Eden, a North American settlement teeming with supernatural dangers, and player combat threats using Red’s conventional weaponry and Antea’s spectral abilities. Players will also interact with New Eden’s residents in choice-driven conversations that steer the course of the narrative, namely in deciding whether to fulfill their duty as a Banisher or sacrifice that oath to restore Antea’s mortality.  


Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. It's the second of three games on Don't Nod's 2023 launch schedule, having released Harmony: The Fall of Reverie last month and it has a meditative climbing game called Jusant slated for this fall.]]></summary>

Like a beautiful and unusual fish that has suddenly risen to the surface, Dave the Diver is an unexpected surprise. Juggling two core systems that work in tandem, it’s a game that excels as both an exploration experience and as a management sim and does so in ways that are intuitive and easy to pick up. However, the real triumph is a focus on novelty at every turn, with a near-constant supply of sudden twists, activities, and ways to engage with the game, resulting in a joyful and approachable adventure that is hard to put down.

Wesley played through one of the stages in the game to get a feel for how classic fighters Billy and Jimmy feel and the three discuss their thoughts on these characters, the visual style, the combat, and more.
Enjoy nearly 10 minutes of new Double Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons gameplay in the latest NGT below: 


Developer Secret Base and publisher Modus Games announced Double Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons earlier this summer with a special trailer that you can watch here. The game is set in New York City after it's been destroyed by nuclear war. Brawlers Billy and Jimmy set out to take back what remains from the violent gangs that have since taken over. However, they won't be doing it alone because the game features a roster of 13 playable fighters, including love interest Marian, newcomer Uncle Matin, and more. 
Secret Base says the beat 'em up features "seamless tag team abilities and a multitude of strategies for devastating combos, defensive, and offensive moves." Players can swap characters on the fly, which you can see in the NGT above, as needed in combat. 
Double Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on July 27. It will feature two-player local co-op at launch. Online co-op is set to arrive later in a post-launch update.

Jukai Studio and publisher Versus Evil announced this release window in a new trailer that also revealed Silent Hill composer Akira Yamaoka will guest compose on the game’s score. And in that trailer, you can hear a tease of his original track, “Splintered Minds.” 
Check out “Splintered Minds” in the latest Stray Souls trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, Yamaoka’s track sounds great, and Silent Hill fans know this is probably just a taste of some excellent music from the famed composer. The trailer also reveals plenty more Stray Souls gameplay, which features third-person gunplay, some stealth elements, and plenty of terrifying monsters. 
Stray Souls hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC via Steam this fall.

Oxenfree II: Lost Signals delivers what I have wanted out of a sequel seven years after the first game's release. Although its overarching A-to-C narrative feels like it is missing a “B” in the journey, I’m impressed with most of what Oxenfree II accomplishes. It brings back the original's simple but charming radio mechanics, adds a walkie-talkie that expands the world around protagonist Riley, and, most importantly, features incredibly well-written and believable characters.

For almost 20 years, Nihon Falcom has created one the richest ensembles of original characters, history, and politics in video games with The Legend of Heroes. Across three narrative arcs (and counting), I’ve explored myriad diverse locations, cultures, governments, and organizations, making the continent of Zemuria the most lived-in world I’ve ever experienced in the medium. Trails into Reverie, the latest entry in the long-running franchise, is a bittersweet culmination; I must potentially say goodbye to some of these characters for good after the series succ…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, a California judge denied the U.S. Federal Trade Commission's request for a preliminary injunction in its case to block Microsoft and Xbox from acquiring Activision Blizzard. Now, shortly after the ruling, Microsoft has announced it will pause its appeal efforts against the Competition and Markets Authority in the U.K. so that it and the CMA can negotiate. 
Back in April, the UK regulatory body blocked Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard over cloud gaming concerns. With a July 18 deadline for the acquisition, Microsoft theoretically needs to either mark the U.K. out of its market as it relates to this purchase or negotiate a deal with the CMA to quell the regulator's concerns. Microsoft was previously set to appear in court to appeal the CMA's block on July 28. According to Microsoft vice chair and president Brad Smith, that won't be happening now as the two parties will instead attempt to negotiate a deal that satisfies both. 
Our statement on the mutual request with the CMA for a pause of our appeal in the UK: pic.twitter.com/8Aky2IJjxS
July 11, 2023
It's important to note that the Competition Appeal Tribunal still needs to either approve or deny this request, as noted by The Verge, but the former seems incredibly likely. In a statement received by The Verge, the CMA said it is "ready to consider any proposals from Microsoft to restructure the transaction in a way that would address the concerns set our in our Final Report," likely alluding to its concerns over cloud gaming (concerns that Microsoft disagrees with). 
Game Informer has reached out to the CMA for a statement regarding Smith's announcement and will update the story if a comment or statement is received. 
What do you think this means for Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

The FTC sought a preliminary injunction in an effort to have the court order Microsoft to cease its attempt at acquiring the Call of Duty maker for a colossal $69 billion. Now that the FTC's request has been denied by the Court, the regulator has until the end of July 14 to appeal the decision, as reported by The Verge. With this ruling, Microsoft can now close its acquisition of Activision Blizzard before its July 18 deadline, although it still has to figure out how it's going to handle the decision from The Competition and Markets Authority in the U.K. t…]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-07-11T14:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tuatara Games has revealed its next project, and it’s a sci-fi survival shoot ‘em up called Let Them Come: Onslaught. 
Tuatara Games has released games before – it released Bare Butt Boxing this May – but it’s perhaps best known for its work as a AAA VFX support studio working on games like Valorant, Fortnite, Godfall, and more. It’s set to release Let Them Come: Onslaught on PC via Steam Early Access in the first quarter of 2024. Let Them Come: Onslaught puts players behind the gun of a lone survivor on an alien planet who must survive hordes of creatures by activating nukes to blow up the planet. 
Check out the teaser trailer for Let Them Come: Onslaught for yourself below:


Tuatara Games says the game features dynamic weather, and a wide range of weapons, including a flamethrower, laser beam, electric grenade, orbital strikes, and more. As you mow down hordes of aliens, you can upgrade your soldier with increased health, defense, reduced weapon cooldowns, and shields you can activate on the battlefield. To obtain these upgrades, you spend XP you earn on each run.
“We are huge fans of this emerging gameplay experience, and are thrilled to reveal our love letter to the games that inspired us,” Tuatara Games founder Klemen Lozar writes in a press release. “Using our team’s VFX expertise, survivors can expect to fight for their lives through adrenaline-inducing experiences that have the best visuals of the genre.” 

Let Them Come: Onslaught also features roguelite elements, meaning a lot will be lost in between each run. However, credits collected on the battlefield stay with you, and you can spend them on permanent upgrades in the Armory. 
Tuatara Games says Let Them Come: Onslaught hits Steam Early Access sometime in Q1 of 2024. It will cost $4.99. The team says, “The decision to launch first on Early Access comes from [the] continued knowledge in incorporating improvements to ensure the final 1.0 launch is as optimized as possible.”]]></summary>

In a humorous trailer featuring Black Noir, he silently confirms to a gaggle of press that he and his cohorts will grace the shooters beginning on July 12. Each hero receives their own Operator Bundle, with Starlight hitting July 12, Homelander on July 16, and Black Noir on July 20. Each is priced at 2,400 COD points and includes the character along with items such as weapon charms, stickers, emblems, and weapon blueprints. Each character also comes with a unique finishing move. 
The update includes The Boys-themed map elements and an additional 6v6 map, a Temp V field upgrade, Diabolical Camo challenges, Battle Royale hitting Vondel, and The Raid finale. You can see what’s coming in the graphic below (click to enlarge).

In the first post, we went into a bit into the infrastructure that runs OpenTTD, from BaNaNaS to our main website. In this post, we will explain a bit about the migration we just did to get to this infrastructure. After over 2 months of work, I am happy to announce we finished (another) infrastructure migration. Today is the day I removed the last few DNS entries pointing to AWS’s DNS servers, and I am proud to mention that (almost) all traffic is now routed via Cloudflare (and we aren’t even receiving sponsoring to say so). In this post I want to take you with me why this migration was needed, what the benefits are, and why you possibly care. But in short summary: (Much) smaller monthly bill as AWS charges insane amounts for bandwidth. Faster download speeds for you (ranging from the in-game content service to downloading the game from our website). Easier maintainability of our infrastructure with thanks to Pulumi. This will be a bit nerdy, so if you like these kind of things, continue the read!]]></summary>
