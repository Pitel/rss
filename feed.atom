BitLife Your Favorite Artist challenge guide


BitLife's Your Favorite Artist has five tasks to complete:



Be born a female in Missouri


Go viral on social media


Come out as bisexual


Have 3+ LGBTQ friends


Earn a gold single after switching labels



Although the first few tasks don't explicitly ask to become a musical star, you'll still need the musician special career pack to join a record label and earn a gold single. Although social media allows you to become famous, it doesn't unlock this extra feature, making t…]]></summary>

        <updated>2024-09-28T17:37:56.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The RTTK promo marks the beginning of a new year for EA FC 25 Ultimate Team, and you can find these special cards in packs, SBCs, and objectives.


Like the previous few years, the promo is once again based around four different European club competitions. All the items have the potential to be upgraded to three levels in the future, but some of the cards are simply better than the rest.


I have ranked the cards based on a combination of multiple factors. While their starting overalls have a significant weightage on the rankings, elements like playstyles, roles, and chances for upgrades have also been considered.


Disclaimer: List to be updates as new cards are released in Ultimate Team. 


EA FC 25 RTTK promo S-tier cards


The S-tier includes the elite items, and you should thank your lucky stars if you manage to pack one of these cards from packs. 



Jude Bellingham


Julian Alvarez


Kadidiatou Diani


Jeremie Frimpong


Jeremy Doku



EA FC 25 RTTK promo A-tier cards


The A-tier items are pretty good, but they're just slightly off the top from being elite tier. 



Cristian Romero


Ollie Watkins


Federico Dimarco


Claudia Pina


Ryan Cherki


Diogo Jota



EA FC 25 RTTK promo B-tier cards


Some of these items will badly need a few upgrades in the upcoming weeks to ensure that they remain viable in the meta. 



Benjamin Sesko


Noa Lang


Donny Van de Beek


Nicolas Otamendi


Moise Kean


Stephen Eustaquio


Nathalie Bjorn



EA FC 25 RTTK promo C-tier cards


While these items are close to B-tier in terms of their current levels, the cards are unlikely to get any major upgrades. 



Robin Koch


Benjamin Andre


Sebastian Poch



Keep an eye out for the results of the matches as they happen in real life. There are always a few surprises along the way, and some of these cards might move up a tier with a surprising upgrade.

They really did bring us to a completely different place — sometimes to the point of not feeling like ads at all. Luckily, Sony even inspired the competition to also make spectacularly weird commercials. So, let's look at some of the few ads in history to have artistic value and thank video games for their existence.







Mental Wealth (PS1)


The most disturbing piece of PlayStation advertisement is likely this very simple interview with a teenage girl from Scotland. The Chris Cunningham-directed ad just shows a girl going on what's either a nonsensical tirade or a visionary speech about mental wealth.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Shindo Life is a Roblox game based on Naruto anime series where you can complete quests, fight bosses, and more. One key element you’ll come across is bloodlines, which give you access to different powers in the game. 


There are three main types of bloodlines: Clan, Elemental, and Eye. However, choosing the best bloodline for you is a bit of a hassle; that’s why we have crafted a tier list of all the bloodlines available in Shindo Life.

To make you understand which tier is best for you, we have divided the tier list into five categories: S, A, B, C, and D. Basically, S-Tier bloodlines are the top dogs, the middle tiers are pretty balanced, and D-Tier bloodlines... well, let’s just say they’re not the greatest. He…]]></summary>

As of now, there are 17 elements, and finding the best one might be a hassle. To help you with that, we have crafted a tier list of all elements in Shindo Life.

The upcoming Warframe: 1999 promises to push the game into an exciting new direction, and we're getting a demo to show it off in short order.


More specifically, Digital Extremes has just announced that Warframe: 1999 is due to receive a sizeable demo around mid-October. If that sounds like a repeat of something that might've happened already, you're not entirely wrong. The recent Lotus Eaters questline was kind-of-sort-of a prologue to 1999, though it turned out to be extremely short and unsatisfying in the end. We did get the AX-52, at least, but it's not like Warframe is lacking in the weapon department. So, the October demo is poised to deli…]]></summary>

Upon first boot, Night Slashers: Remake introduces itself within a mock 4:3 arcade screen bezel, where the first character appears against beautifully drawn scenery, trailed by awesome flesh-decayed zombies. At this point, we thought, “Damn, this looks great.” A moment later, the screen flashed into full widescreen, revealing the actual makeover, and informing us that we had been momentarily fooled by the original arcade graphics. The redrawn aesthetic, in contrast, is a giant leap down.
This anecdote tells you all you need to know about the biggest issue of this remake of Data East's beat 'em up: its visuals are astoundingly tasteless. And no, it’s not a nostalgia issue. The graphics of the far superior arcade original are replaced with an art style that looks reminiscent of stiff, early-'00s Flash games. The new, shadow-puppet-like sprites lack depth, and their overly smooth limbs seem to float about in rest animations and skate unusually across the floor.

        <updated>2024-09-28T12:09:56.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Project Mugetsu is a Roblox game inspired by the anime and manga series Bleach. If you’re a Bleach fan, you’ve probably heard the term “Bankai.” If not, it’s basically the ultimate attack of a Soul Reaper in the series. Since the game revolves around that concept, unlocking Bankai is key to maximizing your character's potential.


To help you out, we’ve put together a guide on how to unlock Bankai in Project Mugetsu.


What is the Meditation Level in Project Mugetsu?


Screenshot by Destructoid


Before we jump in, let’s chat about the Meditation Level. Each player has a specific Meditation Level that goes up when you enter Meditation Mode. You’ll get some key bindings to press, and every correct press earns you one Meditation EXP. But watch out—hit the wrong key, and you’ll lose ten Meditation EXP. If you want to speed things up, using the x2 Mastery can help you double your gains.


How to get Bankai in Project Mugetsu


To unlock Bankai, you’ll need to reach a meditation level of 75 if you’re not in the Urahara Clan. If you are in that clan, you can unlock Bankai at level 50. Just keep in mind that there’s one requirement for all clans: you need to be at player level 40. So, beginners won’t be able to unlock Bankai right off the bat.


Once you hit those levels, you’ll have to win a battle against your Zanpakuto to finally unlock your Bankai.


All the Bankai in Project Mugetsu


There are seven Bankais in this game. Here’s the list:



Tensa Zangetsu


Zanka No Tachi


Nozarashi


Minazuki


Kamishini No Yari


Senbonzakura Kageyoshi


Daiguren Hyorinmaru

Luckily, you can unlock a handy-dandy fast-travel system that will hasten your quest to seal the rifts to the Still World.


Echoes of Wisdom's Fast Travel is easy to unlock and even easier to use


Screenshot via Destructoid


You won't have to wait too long to uncover Echoes of Wisdom's fast-travel system. The game subtly points you down the path you need to go to unlock it, and it takes time to ensure you understand how useful it is. Of course, if you're rushing to get your first dungeon or scope out some fun side-quests, you might breeze by the fast-travel tutorial.


To unlock fast travel, head east along the base after you've escaped Hyrule Castle, spelunk your way through Beach Cave, and finally stop by Suthorn Town. Instead of heading north to the Suthorn Temple, keep going east until you find a green, glowing statue. This is the first of many Waypoints you'll find on your travels across Hyrule.


Once you're close enough to the statue, Tri will explain what it is and how to activate it. To activate the Waypoint, walk up to it and hit the "RZ" trigger, like when you learn a new Echo. Once you've lit the Waypoint, you can activate it anytime by opening the map with the "-" button.


Before you wander into the unknown, remember that the first waypoint you find is the only one the game highlights for you. From here on out, you’ll have to keep your eyes open and take the time to activate every Waypoint you stumble across. Trust me, you’ll need them once the side quests start piling up.

However, one resident of Hyrule Castle Town is eager to see some of the monsters you've collected. Here's how to complete the A Curious Child quest in The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom.


A Curious Child quest location

Located north of Suthorn Forest, Hyrule Castle Town sits at the center of your map. Upon entering the town, take a left to find a boy standing outside a house with an orange roof. Talking to him will initiate the A Curious Child quest.

The boy wants to see a Zol, one of the first monster Echoes you can obtain. If you don't have one yet, you can find them all over Hyrule Field. Once you have a Zol, summon the monster in front of the boy to briefly satisfy his curiosity.


Next, the boy will want to see an Ignizol. This is another monster Echo that you can obtain early from the first cave directly west of Suthorn Village. You can also find a pit full of Ignizols northeast of Hyrule Ranch. Summon an Ignizol near the boy to advance to the boy's final request.


Lastly, the boy wants to see a Hydrozol. This monster can be found in the northeast corner of Hyrule near Seesyde village. Southwest of the Seesyde docks, across the water, you can find a cave containing Hydrozols.


If you summon a regular Hydrozol in front of the boy, he'll be disappointed by the monster's size. To get a giant Hydrozol, summon one in the fountain at the center of the town. Once your Hydrozol's absorbed the water and grown, pick it up and drop it in front of the boy. Your reward for all the monster wrangling is five Might Crystals.

Where is the Great Fairy in Zelda Echoes of Wisdom?

To find the Great Fairy, you’ll need to make your way to Lake Hylia, and then it’s time to go for a swim. The Great Fairy Shrine is located on an island in the middle of the lake.


To get to Lake Hylia, you’ll need to head east from Suthorn Prairie or north from Suthorn Forest. Otherwise, you can reach it by exiting the south gate of Hyrule Castle and heading east. 


Make sure that you activate the Waypoint outside the entrance to the Great Fairy Shrine before your first visit. This will allow you to immediately fast travel to the location for subsequent visits.

Head into the Shrine and make sure to grab the two Fairies who are floating around the room, then interact with the pool in the middle. This will summon the Great Fairy, who will then channel her inner Gok Wan and make you more stylish (and powerful) through the powers of accessorizing. 


After her opening words, select “Make me more stylish!” and then you’ll have the option to purchase additional accessory slots. Each slot will cost incrementally more than the previous one, and you’ll need a total of 1,900 Rupees to eventually unlock all five slots:


Number of accessories

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Using a controller to play EA FC 25 is highly advisable, but users have encountered certain issues post-launch.


Usually, you can use a wide array of controllers on a PC, including third-party offerings. If you own an Xbox or/and a PS, the controllers that come with them can also be used. Unfortunately, the post-launch scenario has witnessed a few issues arising when players have tried to connect their controllers. Thankfully, there are some easy fixes that will allow you to use your controllers without any issues.


EA FC 25 PC controller error fixes


Problems with controllers are usually caused by the Steam input. This mechanism usually makes it easy for you to use any controller with a PC. Unfortunately, some conflicting issues arise with EA FC 25 on PC. I encountered the same trouble last year, and here are some of the fixes you can try.



Turn off the Steam Input. I did it last year and have done it again. Go to the properties of EA FC 25 and then to controller settings. From here, you can turn off Steam Input.


Close your Steam from the task manager and remove the controller. Connect it once again, and then turn on Steam and the game. This should prevent Steam from connecting to Big Picture by mistake.


Make sure you don't have Keyboard and Mouse selected as input methods. The mouse can sometimes interfere with your controller inputs (keep it in the corner to prevent it from randomly popping up in the middle of the screen).


Go to Device Manager and select USB controller settings. Change the calibration and then reset it to the default settings.



Ultimately, I hope there will be a permanent fix for the controller issues that pop up on PC every year. The first title update didn't include anything in this regard, but a bigger patch is expected now that the game's worldwide launch is over.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For a series that featured super-powered teens punching their way through enemy hordes, Mighty Morphin Power Rangers was bereft of brawlers during its glory days of the '90s. Developer Digital Eclipse is set to fix that with Rita's Rewind, and so far, it seems up to the task.


Mighty Morphin Power Rangers featured many brawls between teen drama and visits to the Angel Grove Youth Center, but beyond this, there was only one beat 'em up video game I can recall. In the '90s? I know, it's completely absurd! There were many fighting games, naturally. The brawler in question launched only for the Super Nintendo in 1995. I was a Sega kid, which meant I was out of luck.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As the conversation in literary circles moves more toward current trends in the so-called "BookTok" community, it's becoming harder and harder to make a to-be-read list that includes great works from the classical catalog, or even more modern literature.


While you could arguably spend countless hours with these romantasy novels and fast food books and be thoroughly entertained, most of them tend to leave something to be desired when it comes to a lasting impact on your worldview or thought process.


That's why we've decided to make this list of some of the great works of fiction to read in your 20s and be moved not only by the power of their evocative themes but also by the sheer grace of their literary form.

Last week, Nintendo and The Pokémon Company announced that they were filing a patent infringement lawsuit against Palworld developer Pocketpair. While the latter studio claimed it was "unaware of the specific patents we are accused of infringing upon," online speculation soon began to throw out various plausible-sounding submissions from Nintendo's back catalogue.
While there's still no official word on which designs are relevant to this case, MBHB law firm associate Andrew Velzen has noted (via GamesIndustry.biz) that some seemingly key patents were in fact filed after Palworld's release, suggesting Nintendo has been on the lawsuit drive for a while.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The beauty of cards is that they can be anything. You can slap together a working game with them in a couple of minutes. Take 12 blanks, doodle some faces and landscapes, and lo, you have a procedural narrative generator. Make some duplicates, invent a few rules and lo, you have systems. 


Conversely, the great drawback of cards - especially in those roguelite deckbuilders people have been churning out since Slay The Spire - is that everything can be reduced to them. For example: last night, I played a round of Fungi with my partner, Fungi being a charming tabletop foraging sim in which you gather scrumptious chantarelles and boletus from the forest floor. This morning I resumed playing Breachway, out now in early access, in which you guide a starship through a series of wartorn solar systems, with battles unfolding as a turn-based exchange of cards corresponding to ship components.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We’ve known for years that consoles have simply become preboxed PCs, and now look: we’re getting into their controllers as well. The Razer Wolverine V3 Pro (and its wired cousin, the Wolverine V3 Tournament Edition) has looked to desktop peripherals in search of superior button-bashing, cannibalising the rather good Razer Viper gaming mouse series for its switches. The result is a high-performing, satisfyingly clicky pad that, yes, works wonderfully on PC – albeit one that rinses you for four times(!) as much as a standard Xbox controller.

A new Californian law will come into effect in 2025 that will effectively force digital storefronts to disclose that buyers don't actually own their digital puchases, but rather simply licensing the content.
Naturally, we suspect that most of our audience will already be aware of this, but it's entirely possible that more casual gamers will not be privy to the way that digital storefronts function. Effectively, then, as reported by The Verge (thanks, Time Extension) digital storefronts will be restricted from using the words "buy, purchase, or any other term which a reasonable person would understand to confer an unrestricted ownership interest in the digital good or alongside an option for a time-limited rental."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As befits the “very normal gardening game” that puzzly mystery box Grunn winkingly bills itself as, the first tool I obtained was a pair of shears. The second tool I obtained was a trumpet. It doesn’t really work like a trumpet, and it does things no regular trumpet could or should do. I got a trowel next. Here’s the thing about the trowel: it’s a pretty good trowel. Nothing fancy. But recently, I keep digging up… objects. Objects most peculiar. I’ve got the weekend to sort this garden, and a cosy little shed to sleep in, so I really should just get on with it. Again, though, I must reiterate: I keep digging up… objects.
I go to clean some rubbish from the bathroom. I interact with the mirror and the game says: “You do not see anything in the mirror”. I take a note that says: I do not see anything in the mirror. I check the game again and no, I still do not see anything in the mirror. Sure it’s fine. Just a shit mirror, probably. They should get it replaced. What good is a mirror you can’t see anything in?

Speaking as both a news editor and a former paperboy, who broke his mind and body hauling obese Sunday editions to the millionaire houses at the top of the valley, Paperboy is my role model. Or he would be if my role model weren't actually Steven Spielberg's Freakazoid. Paperboy's heyday has long since passed into history, however, and the business of journalism has changed beyond recognition. People don't read newspapers anymore, they just eat pizza.

Stone's forthcoming Known Mysteries is a ritual of the sun, I guess.

For those who don't know the game, this third-person helljaunt sees its players wandering through the battlefields of an endless conflict between three major world powers. Mechs stomp past you, ignoring you in favour of decimating enemy soldiers. Bug-like drones hover overhead, scanning for prey. And horrifying mommy harvesters scavenge bodies from the debris. As a collection of imagery, it's powerful stuff. As a game that you can play (with up to three pals) it is very rough, and not just around the edges.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey, remember Lost In Random? I reviewed it way back when and thought its Burtonesque setting and story were top notch, but it felt a bit reliant on samey fights. Moonhood Studios, founded by the creators of LIR, just announced The Midnight Walk at last night's PlayStation State Of Play showcase. And it looks to continue their appreciation of the dark and the strange. Case in point: it's a first-person adventure where you play as The Burnt One, who must steer a hideous pot creature through a twisted universe.

Open world samurai action game Ghost Of Tsushima is getting a follow-up called Ghost Of Yotei, developers Sucker Punch have announced (or Ghost Of Yōtei, to include the technically-correct-but-annoying-to-reproduce-on-UK-keyboards diacritic that I will hereby drop to secure our sanity). It looks very picturesque and, like its predecessor, inspired by the Kurosawa showdowns of old. You can see for yourself in the trailer that acted as the finale of Sony's marketing show.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last year we reported horror game Alan Wake 2 would be getting a couple of expansions. We've already had one of these in the form of Night Springs. And Edwin noted that the other would probably be a crossover with Remedy's other big game, Control, featuring secret government agency, the Federal Bureau of Control. He was right, judging by the trailer shown at yesterday's PlayStation Showcase. 
The Lake House DLC is due out in October, and does indeed feature a facility run by the shady organisation whose job it is to keep powerful "altered items" from running amok. But it looks like somebody let a messed-up oil painting out of its cage.

MÖRK BORG Heresy Supreme is a grotty cheese dream of a 2D action game based on the popular tabletop RPG MÖRK BORG - a book so nice to just have on your shelf that I’m not even mad I accidentally bought a copy in Swedish.

This is the same Behaviour Interactive who recently laid off a bunch of people, cancelled a game and closed a studio, Midwinter Entertainment, after bagging themselves a bunch of developers (the others are SockMonkey, Codeglue and Fly Studio) over the past two years. Darkest Dungeon is a horror game like DBD, so I guess the acquisition chimes from that perspective. All the same, my snap judgement is "yikes".

Said remaster project was rumoured earlier this year, when Sarafan scouts caught sight of a telltale plaque at San Diego Comic-Con. Consider that rumour strongly trending towards the status of a Real Thing, because Sony are in the habit of publishing Real Things, and they've just (accidentally, I guess) popped a bunch of screens and a trailer with a release date - 10th December 2024 - on the PlayStation website.

For those who don't remember the first GreedFall, it was a colonial-styled RPG about landing on the magical shores of another continent and getting into scrapes with monsters and frontiersfolk. This time the story is furthering the fantasy Columbian exchange by putting you in the role of a native who's been uprooted against their will and taken to the "old world". The game's release comes against a backdrop of dissatisfaction in the studio. But workers have gained some concessions in talks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For years, a dangerous and charismatic game has evaded the grasp of many designers. Some say it doesn't exist, that no publisher would ever back it. I'm talking about the one city block RPG that Warren Spector has often mentioned. Sure, we've seen a few usual suspects already - Deus Ex Mankind Divided, Disco Elysium, even Else: Heart.Break - they all grimace in the line-up but nothing ever sticks. Now, out of the gloom of indie development, comes another perp ready to have his mugshot taken. Shadows Of Doubt is an open world detective sim that comes perilously close to being our guy. Its clothes, stature, gait, and fingerprints match the description of what Spector often describes. And yet, if you tilt your head, something is just a little off. The game isn't confined to one block. It's not an RPG precisely. And its simulation has plenty of bugs, jank, and unintentional comedy. But after all this time, in the absence of a smoking gun, shouldn't we just put this guy in the slammer and call the case closed? I say yes, let's. Officers! Arrest this game, it's brilliant.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The in thing when it comes to dinosaur conversations now is this: "Yeah but did you know that they weren't all like, lizardy, but covered in feathers". You might want to chuck in that chickens are basically dinosaurs, because their feet have a "Triassic Flange", a (made-up) term that will make you sound authoritative. If you really want to showcase your knowledge, though, you may want to mention that dinosaurs may have actually fought with large swords lodged between their teeth. Dinoblade demonstrates this! And no, they haven't discovered swords alongside dinosaur fossils yet because palaeontologists have been unlucky thus far. "Soon", you tell them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We liked Jusant, Don't Nod's clamber-upper masterpiece, and we also liked Banishers, their colonial ghost-busting action-adventure, but it seems that not enough people did. The company have posted a profit warning, reflecting an 11% decline in operating revenue for the first half of 2024. They've also "paused" two unannounced games in development, and altered other unannounced games to be more appealing to a "wider audience". Beyond that, they're considering "all possible options regarding our roadmap", which sounds just a touch ominous.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm not someone who's ever been on board with the "Can You Pet The Dog?" craze that swept and/or still sweeps video games. As a heartless individual, I am more concerned with whatever the dog's capable of: general savagery, a howl that replenishes my HP bar, letting me climb atop its glorious mane as it strides across the barren wastes. If it's none of these things, I would much rather have a shiny turret on spindly steel legs skitter besides me.
Nomada Studios have, incredibly, thrust their hands into my chest cavity and given me a blood-pumping mechanism. Having spent some time with upcoming action-platformer Neva (the game) and Neva (the dog from the game), I have to admit: I did enjoy petting Neva (the dog).

Near Mint is a roguelike deckbuilder where you advance through a tower fighting slightly stronger iterations of the exact same skeleton. Ok, nothing too captivating so far. The twist comes from the cards: someone’s left them in their Oodie pouch, spilt BBQ sauce down it, then stuck it in the wash before taking the deck out. Now, all the cards have split apart into three pieces. It’s name-your-own-price on Itch here, and it’ll only take you a couple minutes to get acquainted, but I’ll explain the gist below. Gist is a good word. Satisfying to say. Gist.

It’s hard not to be moved by the exaggerated kineticism of it all – the magic-enhanced swordfights, the jumping off cliffs and turning into a flying shadow monster, the ability to drift horses. Yes. Yes!
I’m therefore somewhat unnerved to report that my enthusiasm has been tempered significantly by actually playing it. I’ve since used all the straws I’ve clutched at to spell out "It’s just a demo" on my floor, but the fear remains that Crimson Desert’s fantastical open-world exploration is going to be interrupted by regular bouts of twangy, unwieldy, unsatisfying combat.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When playing a new Soulslike, there’s an element of translation involved while you figure out the language of the game. What are the upgrade materials called? What’s the equivalent of poison? What are experience points and checkpoints called, although you’re going to call them souls and bonfires anyway? I’ve done this many, many times, but on this occasion there was a surprising twist, one which would have notorious pearl-clutching racist HP Lovecraft spinning in his grave. Enotria: The Last Song’s arcane Soulslike language is actually just Italian.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed is a remaster of Disney Epic Mickey, a cult classic 3D platformer first released a decade ago on the Wii. In the original you controlled the titular Mickey Mouse who, armed with a magical paintbrush (wieldable by waving the Wiimote about), could paint or rub out surfaces to solve puzzles. It was the work of Junction Studios led by Warren Spector, best known for being The Deus Ex Guy. No, sadly Mickey could not nano-augment his brush for better target acquisition, nor project laser-guided anti-tank rockets from his podgy white mitts.
And no, Rebrushed doesn't let him do anything of these either. Clearly a missed opportunity. But is it better nonetheless? With an updated look, some added secrets, more moves for Mickey, and controller/M&K support, I'd say longtime Mickey heads will adore this nostalgia trip. For total newcomers like me, I'd say it's a platformer that's certainly charming and clever and wonderfully experimental, but a bit flat in places too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Spoilers throughout. TLDR: fun, generous, beautiful animation and cinematography. Worked mostly fine on my PC. I would not have given it the best narrative award if it were up against Gran Turismo 7. 
Writing of the frigid framing of Clockwork Orange’s atrocities, the film critic Pauline Kael asked: “is there anything sadder - and ultimately more repellent - than a clean-minded pornographer?” The lavishly directed and animated universe of God Of War Ragnarok is far from repellent, but it also feels spiritually squeegeed; a world of pulpy violence so chirpy and chaste as to strain belief that the scars that haunt its reformed anti-hero could have ever been inflicted there.

Reported by Bloomberg as a disagreement over attempts to "spin off the video-game division as an independent entity," the details were nonetheless somewhat scant. A  new report from Rebekah Valentine at IGN has since shed some more light on the walkout, which reportedly involved “disagreements over the direction of the Interactive division, chaotic departures, communication breakdowns, and a perceived lack of leadership transparency.” It’s a thorough account of some messy events I recommend reading in full, but here’s a brief rundown.

We've been excited to get our hands on its shears for a while, thanks in part to an excellent demo, and in part due to it being from Sokpop Collective member and Bernband developer Tom van den Boogaart.

Now it has a release date: October 4th.

X Corp. challenged the subpoena, citing the user's anonymous speech rights under the First Amendment. In an order published this week, a district court judge denied X Corps' motion to quash, in theory exposing the alleged leaker's identity to Cognosphere.

They’ll likely take everything I have, including my typing keyboard, so this is goodbye from me. With my last digital breath, I only wish to inspire a bit more joy in the world, so I’m demanding everyone in the comments give me cat updates whether or not they own a cat. Just make up some lore for the cat you don’t have and tell me about it. Here's what we're all clicking on this weekend.

You can do that anywhere.”
A QA tester with Zenimax currently on union leave, Mitchell joined the Communications Workers Of America (CWA) as a full-time organiser after she and her colleagues formed what was, at the time, the biggest union in videogames - ZeniMax Workers United. Now she helps the CWA do what they did for her and her colleagues at Zenimax: provide support, training, resources and guidance for workers in the videogame industry who have decided, for whatever reason, that they want to unionise.

The major one is that a lot of its quests exist to create distance between places and plot beats. They are overwritten errands such as bringing people lunch or fetching herbs or carrying letters - dessicated, MMO-ish fare, thrust into a moderately enjoyable action-RPG for the sake of incremental worldbuilding and scale.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fifteen months on from its PS5 release, Final Fantasy XVI – that actiony RPG of emo-fringed hack ‘n’ slashing and disquietingly sexy Ralph Ineson characters – is now on PC. Enough time, you’d think, to do a proper job of rejigging it with Windows spanners, especially after Final Fantasy XV’s port got so much stick for its lack of features and performance issues.
FFVXI does make some improvements, adopting a full set of DLSS and FSR upscalers and frame generators, and its mouse and keyboard integration feels generally slicker than XV. Sadly, it’s still no first-rate adaptation, neglecting numerous PC features and giving low-end systems an even deeper kick in the plums. Cutting the quality settings can help, as per the guide down below, but overall performance is so up-and-down than you’ll likely never achieve a perfectly smooth ride.

Cheers then, The Bird Of A Thousand Voices, for showing up in my inbox and giving me a second reference point next to Sugar.

It’s part of a multimedia project based Armenian folk tale Hazaran Blbul (Firebird). It’s completely free, and you can find it here.

It’s a turn-based battler with an empire-building component in which you play as several emperors in succession, passing on abilities and knowledge to your heir. In what I consider to be a poetic complementary flourish, you can also pass on save data from the demo to the full game. Look, this is what counts as “poetic” just before lunch on a Thursday.

It was a brilliant dystopian scavenging sim in which you searched cellars for bolts while avoiding the attentions of creatures that hate being looked at, or which only move when they're not being looked at, or which look like your friends, from a distance. The developer's next game, Welcome To The Dark Place, is more about hearing. It's an "open-world, auditory text-based adventure" which mostly takes place in pitch blackness.

The sidescrolling metroidvania is a rich, expansive, and surprisingly challenging take on a genre typically dominated by indies, and it's precisely the kind of game I wish mega-publishers produced more.

It's also now got a story expansion, Mask Of Darkness, which came out yesterday.

I then combed through several thousand comments below said video, many of which expressed similar longing for the hypothetical Good Old Days, before those wily feminists invaded the medium, transformed every game into a LGBT+ weeping simulator, and threw all the Real Men into a big hole. I did this because I was searching for one particular comment written by somebody claiming to be Matthew Karch, CEO of Space Marine 2 developers Saber Interactive.

Folk hero or not, Marko certainly has some heroic facial hair: his moustache floweth so bountifully that it can’t be contained in his character portrait. Extremely powerful of him.

The existence of the game was first confirmed by Cal Kestis actor Cameron Monaghan, during an Ocala Comic Con panel. “We’re working on a third and we’re in the process of doing that right now,” said Monaghan, which is about as straightforward an affirmative as one could want. It was also double-confirmed this February, following news of layoffs at EA, via Eurogamer.

This blocklist has recently expanded with the sports streaming site TotalSportek. The responsible “Clearing Body” concluded that, since efforts to shut down the site or identify its owners failed, site blocking is a reasonable and proportionate measure.

I feel like I’ve sluggishly ambled my way down to the fridge and tried to scoop a gherkin from the jar, only to find a disconcertingly tasty sliver of my own brain - like a creature from Flatland trying to play 4D chess, and all the pieces are just tiny carvings of my face with “lol get a load of this prick” whittled into the forehead. I quite like it.
“We combined your favorite genres into one grotesque piece of software! You're welcome, game journalists,” reads the Steam page for the demo. That is a very polite way to kick me in the head and call me a bitch, LYMBUS.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been long suspected (if not officially confirmed) that the first Red Dead Redemption will be getting a PC remaster some time in the near future. We've already seen a description for the PC version appear briefly on the PlayStation store (of all places). And earlier this year a snoopy fan of the studio who monitors the backend of Rockstar's launcher found similar game descriptions buried amid metadata. Yesterday, that same practice yielded yet another clue - the game's Steam app number.

In response to a community sentiment best summed up by a popular Reddit post titled “Let the super earth burn”, Arrowhead released a statement. “In short, we didn’t hit our target with the latest update…what matters most now is action. Not talk.” Said action (which, it must be pointed out, felt a bit troublingly reactive to the loudest and most histrionic voices in the roo..uh, subreddit) was foreshadowed in a list of issues to be tackled over the coming months.

With survival achieved, and the introduction's excellently sinister advisor whispering evil Tory ideas, the whole city you built in Frostpunk is now just the headquarters for a sprawling expansion effort, and your rule is no longer absolute. Rather than retread the same "prepare for ultra-Winter" ground, your biggest obstacle will likely be your own people, now formed into shifting political parties, and looking outward with colonial eyes. The result is a complicated, laborious survival citybuilder that's two parts compelling, and one part frustrating for the wrong reasons.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I really wanted to like action adventure The Plucky Squire more than I do now, having given its charming 2D to 3D platforming a proper whirl. Yes, it's lovely to look at. Yes, hopping out of a storybook and making friends with an illustration on a coffee mug is cool. And yes, everyone can have a mildly fun time with its puzzles and fights. But that's the problem: who is everyone? At first I thought, "This game is for young kids and that's fine!", given its relative simplicity. Then I hit some puzzles and thought, "Ain't no kid figuring this out".
Then it hit me. It struggles to balance the fine line between being approachable for tiny tots and layered enough for people who've graduated from "goo goo ga ga" to "oo oo aa aa my back hurts". And that's down to how plucky you're allowed to squire at any given time, because it can be surprisingly limited and, sadly, a bit underwhelming.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You can't travel back to the 1980s. But what if I told you it was possible to gently warp your memories of that time? UFO 50 is a kart of 50 games that once existed for an old computer system, all lovingly restored by a gang of coders. The old console, of course, is a fiction. The LX-I never existed. But it's a fun pseudo-history against which to create a grab bag of small games (some throwaway, others mighty) all designed with a distinct 80s look. It's an exercise in adhering to an aesthetic. Like an oil painter working with a limited range of colours, the developers of this bundle have stuck to a 32-colour equivalent of the Zorn palette. Yet play a little of each game, and you start to sense the smirk of chronos. These games aren't stuck in the past, but they are enjoying a holiday there.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Why is every blockbuster video game now some kind of live service game? Speaking as a clueless idiot, the explanation I find most convincing is that it's an attempt to bridge the gap between the returns publishers want from video games, versus how much we're able or willing to pay upfront. "Triple-A" projects now cost exorbitant sums to develop, partly thanks to wider economic inflation, but also because publishers have spent decades teaching players that every sequel has to be More and Shinier. Premium game prices have not risen in proportion, and investors want growth, as they do.
Live service games sneak around this difficulty by dragging out the time we spend playing them. Whether premium or free-to-play, they seek to install themselves as habits by means of regular, planned updates and additions. This is time that can be monetised by way of a subscription model, time in which other products may be sold to you, like skins and paintjobs, and time that becomes a commodity in itself, "engagement", which can be transmuted and exploited to various end. I'm not sure it's ever been expressed this way in any press release boast about longevity, but the unspoken principle/logical extrapolation seems to be that ideally, a live service game should keep us plugged in and plugging away till we die.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Strange Scaffold’s newly released FPS I Am Your Beast is very fun for quite a few reasons, but chief among them is a deep appreciation for the poetry of good videogame violence. I’m not using the big P word just to throw out an overly worthy comparison to something we might associate with craft or beauty, but as a nod toward the game’s playful application of what I previously called ‘a euphoric splurge of murderous game verbiage’ one morning where I had clearly eaten my wordy Weetabix. The way its hurled knives and curb stomps and inexplicable decapitations flow together have an assonant, almost Suessian quality to them.
But it’s also, well, just a bit like Mad Libs. You play as Harding, a man who’s mythical lethality is established very early on. The showing is there in the moment to moment, but the telling is conveyed through cute tricks like how everyone you meet is so deeply afraid of Harding that they loudly keep track of exactly what weapon he’s holding at all times. The Mad Libs comes in through the fact that you can draw Harding a route between A and B, and it’s a given that multiple heads are going to come unstuck from necks along the way. You’re sort of just casually filling in the verbs that seem the most fun to you in the moment. One of the verbs is ‘hornet’. Hornet is a verb now.

Happily, it transpires that Proletariat have resurrected their creation and handed it over to posterity in the shape of a free standalone Community Version, available on Itch.io.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am sure gladiator roguelike RPG We Who Are About To Die’s latest update is very nice, and its accompanying 30% celebratory discount even nicer. You can find the full patch notes here, and I’d be interested to hear how significant they are from the more fascina-pilled among you. They mean nothing to me, however, because We Who Are About To Die has been taunting me from my wishlist since it launched in early access a few years back. Well, no more. Throw me to the lions!
