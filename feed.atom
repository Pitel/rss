        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Christmas is approaching, so it's time to get into the holiday spirit. Everyone has their own version of what this looks like, and for many gamers, this involves keeping the spooky season rolling after Halloween.


There's an interesting niche of Christmas horror games on Steam, giving players the best of both worlds. Here are 10 I reckon you should give a try this holiday season. Note that these aren't just games set on Christmas. Instead, the holiday is the central theme in these games, just like Die Hard being set at Christmas doesn't make it a "Christmas movie" (sorry).

Some are normal, with people asking you to help pick up trash or deliver some food. Other times, they want you to pull some pranks or randomly give others paper because life's boring. 


Although it's a little odd, we're not here to judge them. Here's how to give paper to someone in LEGO Fortnite Brick Life.

How to find paper in LEGO Fortnite Brick Life


Giving paper to someone in LEGO Fortnite Brick Life requires giving someone any paper item that isn't strictly job-related. In other words, you can give someone a movie ticket from Watch-O-Plex or paper from a mailbox, but you can't go around giving someone citation tickets or important bank documents. The easiest way is to approach any mailbox around Brick Bay and pick up a stack of papers.

Generally speaking, as long as the item is made of paper in some way, it's acceptable for this task. I haven't tested it with books yet, but considering a movie ticket works, there's some leeway. The task also specifies you can give any type of paper, so I'm sure there's room for surprises here.


Once you have your papers, hold right-click in front of an NPC or your platform's give button to gift the stack. You can also do this to another player, but they're not guaranteed to accept the "gift." The controls are also a little awkward, so don't worry if it takes a couple of tries for someone to take the paper.


Upon accepting the paper, they'll express gratitude for unknown reasons, marking the task as complete and allowing you to take on another job later. You've now given someone paper and can either feel good about the prank or question the point of it.

As tradition goes, any game launched from December 2023 to the beginning of December 2024 is a valid entry for this list. Trust me, I'm just as hyped as you are about games like Antonblast, Marvel Rivals or Infinity Nikki, but they'll have to wait until next year.

Turok: Origins does look very fun and promising so far: The character designs are solid, the dinosaurs (and other prehistoric creatures) look threatening, and there's a brilliant new gimmick centered on absorbing the dinosaur's DNA in order to use their own abilities, as confirmed by Saber Interactive in the game's official Steam page. Everything looked pretty good, but how it'll go down is anyone's guess after looking at the footage.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Having money in Fortnite Brick Life is important, just like in real life, and it's no surprise that the best way to do so is with a job.


Sure, there are other ways to earn money, such as breaking into the vault or withdrawing from the ATM daily. However, jobs are the only sustainable way to earn money, and doing so will help you advance your in-game progression. While the jobs will fetch you similar amounts, here are some of my favorite ones.


Best jobs in Fortnite Brick Life to make money


There are 12 jobs that are currently available at launch, and each of them offers 500 currency. However, a trending job will give 2,000 currency upon every completed task. Here are some of the best ones to look out for.



Since you can freely switch your jobs, always look out for what's trending. If a job is trending, completing a task earns you four times the usual yield. Hence, this should be on the top of your list whenever you're looking for a job.


Security Officer is a fun job for me as you're tasked with the responsibility of maintaining the city's law and order.


Sushi Chef is another good choice as I love to cook in real life. Additionally, I found this particular job to be trending quite a lot on my adventures, helping me to make more money.


Durr Burger Line Cook is another popular choice for me since you get to cook.

If you want to try doing something different, the Banker could be an interesting choice. Of course, make sure not to get lured by the vault and the riches included in it. Being a Banker might be a great decision, especially if you're into finances and riches.


Ultimately, what matters is doing a job at all times, as it's the best way to earn money. If you want to mix-max your experience, it's best to always opt for the trending jobs. But Brick Life is a pretty chill experience, so make sure to focus on doing things that you like.

While I can’t apologize on their behalf, there is another way I can set things right: by creating a new, much more definitive list. Just as they do, I, too, have a strong appreciation for the Blue Bomber stretching way back to my childhood when I vicariously played the games through screenshots in a Nintendo Power password book. I’ve even read the Worlds of Power novelization of the second game. These facts, partnered with my massive brain and equally-sized ego, ensure that this will be the definitive ranking of Mega Man games. I'll also…]]></summary>

'Game' is a funny word. On its face, it describes lighthearted, fun, frivolous things. Even a very serious game of snooker, in which people wear waistcoats, is 'just a game' on some level. But of course video games can be very different, and Pine is one such game. The subtitle gives it away – A Story of Loss – and it does exactly what it says on the tin.
You might be inclined to imagine something like Arise: A Simple Story, where some light platforming guides you through allegorical landscapes in between cutscenes. However, Pine could be politely described as 'gameplay-light'. The protagonist is an unnamed man living alone in a forest clearing. He fells trees for firewood, grows vegetables in a small allotment to feed himself, and does little else besides carving little statuettes of a woman he loves but has lost.

But in 2024, full-fledged remakes, are mostly dominating the category. Rather than the subtle enhancements of earlier times, remakes are typically complete recreations of a classic game that update the entire experience to make it a familiar yet new experience.


This category is typically hard to find enough nominees for, but this year, it was one of the tougher ones to trim down to seven entries. Let's take a look at our nominees for the Best Remaster/Remake of 2024:

This reveal trailer is very brief, and it doesn't such very much, aside from the fact that Shadow will get to drive a beautiful new black & red car that perfectly fits his aesthetic. The graphics of Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds look very polished and, based on the title, it seems like this is going to be a sequel to 2019's Team Sonic Racing.


However, many fans think this game will be similar to the Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing series, as the intriguing subtitle CrossWorlds may hint that Shadow the Hedgehog will cross over with characters from other Sega properties. There's also a…]]></summary>

This beautiful animated trailer tells the story of Kenji Mozu, a young ninja who will have to protect Hayabusa Village from a terrifying army of demons while the series' protagonist, Ryu Hayabusa, is far and away traveling to America.

However, while not so straightforward, this is what you need to know to obtain him.


How to get Cyte-09 in Warframe


To get Cyte-09 in Warframe, you must first complete the 1999 quest. Per the game's message, it’ll take about an hour and a half to complete. You have to see it through to the end, too. 


Upon completing the quest, you will be given the blueprint for the Warframe, but you still need to get the other three parts to put it all together. That being said, you now need to partake in the new bounty system to get his parts.

Even horror games that encourage hiding in the shadows do it for me. I just love being sneaky (read: cowardly). So I was pleased to see that the upcoming Thick as Thieves will almost certainly be ticking that box for me.


The trailer shows a new stealthy game that has you leaping about like the acrobatic burglar you are, stealing from the wealthy. What has me even more intrigued is the game is being brought to us by some of the developers behind the aforementioned Thief series, as well as Deus Ex; classics in the genre, I'm sure you'll agree.

We're here to celebrate its accomplishments by welcoming you to our nominee list for the best PlayStation 4/5 games in 2024.  


But before we dive into nominees, you should at least know our guidelines for this list before moving forward. We'll only be looking at games from December 2023 to November 2024, so titles that have only just been released this year won't be making it. Additionally, each game can only make it to one category. So, if an entry was released on multiple platforms, it may show up on our other lists, such as Indie or Xbox.

As you might expect, Maple Syrup comes from Maple Trees in Stardew Valley, just as it does in real life. However, before you can get syrup, you’ll need to find the right trees, and then get a Tapper. 


Once you’ve done both of those things, you’ll be able to get Maple Syrup and begin using it in your crafting or for other things.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Finding the Mirage Island in Blox Fruits is a bit tricky, considering that it spawns for only 15 minutes. What makes it even tougher is that it can appear anywhere, even far beyond the normal map boundaries. To help you with that, here is a comprehensive guide on how you can find Mirage Island in Blox Fruits.


How to find Mirage Island in Blox Fruits

First things first, Mirage Island will only appear in the Third Sea, and as mentioned before, it will only last for 15 minutes. It will always spawn in the direction that you are facing, so that’s a big clue. But that doesn’t end it, as you have to improve your chances with the help of your crew. 


As of Update 20, the chances of spawning on Mirage Island will increase if there are more ships in the area. Don’t get confused; it doesn’t matter about the number of people, but the number of ships. 


But you have to be aware of Ships Raid and Sea Monster, as they can take a lot of your time. It is better that you skip those and pursue the Mirage Island. Also, you should know that Mirage Island can appear both day and night. 


But at night, you might encounter a visibility issue when the Sea Danger level reaches six. To counter that, you can use the Kitsune Mask accessory to help you see better in these conditions. If you still find it super dark, you can enable fast mode, as it can remove a lot of the darkness and smoke.


Also, using glowing abilities like Soul Guitar’s M1, Awakened Magma’s Volcanic Storm [V], or Awakened Buddha’s Shift [Z] can light up the area and help you spot the island more easily. If you have RoShade, then you can use the RimLight to reduce fog. With that, you will be able to spot Mirage Island much easier.

How to farm Regal Shards in Path of Exile 2


If you have been playing Path of Exile 2 for any amount of time, then you should already know that defeated enemies usually drop Regal Shards. Stacking twenty Regal Shards means getting a Regal Orb, which can be used to upgrade your magic equipment, leveling it up to "Rare" status, thus making it much stronger. Unfortunately, the drop rate for Regal Shards is pretty low.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The festive season is in full swing across the globe, and Eorzea is not immune from the holiday cheer. The Starlight Celebration is returning to Final Fantasy XIV as it does each year, bringing new rewards and a new story quest to play through. 


From December 16 to December 31, if you head to Mih Khetto’s Amphitheatre in Old Gridania, you’ll find yourself surrounded by festive spirit. The tree will be up and decorated, and lights will be strung overhead. It’s impossible not to feel the good-will of the holiday season when you’re surrounded by this much decoration, and there are even photo props set up for players to enjoy.

Whereas last year the reward for completing the Starlight Celebration quest was the Unorthodox Saint’s glamour set, this year it’s the turn of the Chocobos to get a new festive outfit. The Starlight Stall Bird will be accompanied by other items that can be purchased for Gil from a nearby vendor. 


The following decorative housing items will be available while the event is active:



Starlight Kinderpunsch 


Starlight Mug Tower


Festive Starlight Celebration Advertisement


Winter’s Warm Boughs Orchestrion Roll



If you missed out on last year’s reward, then don’t worry, you’ll have another chance to get your hands on it when it goes up for sale on the Final Fantasy XIV Online Store as previous years’ items always do. It will likely be available as soon as the event goes live, so make sure to keep an eye out.

Perhaps unsurprisingly to some, this years festivities won’t just been kept to the main three starter cities. If you’ve completed the first part of the Echoes of Vana’diel Alliance Raid series, apparently there will be something festive awaiting if you visit Lower Jeuno while the event is live. There aren’t any details available about what exactly you’ll find there, but it will definitely be worth checking out.

Great news, right? Thing is, The Long Dark remains unfinished, a decade after its release.


The situation with The Long Dark and its developer, Hinterland, is admittedly complex, but the gist of it really isn't. Originally announced using Kickstarter back in 2014, as was the fashion at the time, The Long Dark's key promise at the time was that it would deliver a comprehensive episodic campaign known as Wintermute.


Then, the game was released with a stronger sandbox/survival slant, which led to a massive pivot towards developing those bits and bobs instead of focusing on Wintermute proper. Now, with 2025 …]]></summary>

Back in 2021, modder Mark Kurko revealed a first look at his monster project, 'BK Nostalgia 64'. This love letter to the N64 and Banjo-Kazooie (whodathunkit with a title like that?) was originally slated for a Christmas 2024 release, though through a variety of complications, the modder has decided to push things back to 2025. Fortunately, there's a brand-new teaser to watch until then, which we've timestamped above.
Unlike Kurko's previous mods, which meshed Banjo with a singular other N64 game — 'The Legend of Banjo-Kazooie: The Jiggies of Time' unsurprisingly mixed BK and Ocarina — Nostalgia 64 sees the bear and bird combined with a whole host of classic titles in an original adventure. It's like a classic Banjo game, but you can hop into the Mushroom Kingdom! How cool is that?

One of the biggest news stories to come out of last night's Game Awards was the announcement of Elden Ring: Nightreign, a new standalone, co-op Elden Ring experience coming to PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S and PC next year.
Our lucky friends over at IGN got to speak to the game's director, Junya Ishizaki, and one of the questions relates to the game coming to Nintendo's upcoming Switch successor. It's undoubtedly a fair query, given that the three-player PvE outing is also coming to last-gen hardware like the PS4 and Xbox One.

It was never going to be a Nintendo night and, as predicted, Switch announcements were thin on the ground during last night's TGA 2024 presentation.
Nintendo failed to win a single award, but looking back on 2024's first-party releases, you could argue that if there's a year Nintendo didn't deserve to win anything, it was this one. Don't get us wrong, there have been some very fine games on Switch but nothing that's likely to be in 'Game of the Generation' conversations — certainly nothing on the scale of Tears of the Kingdom.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Geoffies have delivered us a first look at the gameplay for Obsidian’s spacefaring RPG sequel, The Outer Worlds 2. It looks, as you might expect, very much like the first one, but a bit nicer. The game itself was announced back in 2021, but we’ve seen nary a vaguely satirical sign nor very large gun since.

If, like me, you really enjoyed the French developers' previous martial art sims, you might, like me, find this news deflating. Football? We already have that at home. It's like a martial art, but all you get to kick is some... ball.
I'm not sure I'll ever entirely swallow my disappointment, but credit where it's due, Rematch does look like both an enjoyable game and a quietly disruptive one. It's also struck a chord with me inasmuch as it's a new way into the culture of a sport which I have pretty mixed feelings about.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A master thief creeps over cobbles in an early modern metropolis that splits the difference between Edinburgh, Glasgow and Liverpool. Lit by gaslamps that can’t quite dispel the industrial haze, they pass for a civilian - a rough one, admittedly, but not shady enough to cause an itch in the swordarm of any passing guard.
Until, that is, they take to the thieves’ highway - following the trajectory of their grappling hook upward to the rooftops, from which they can see the shape of the city, and the moon beyond. Up here, it’s a parallel world - the trees on street level answered by chimney stacks, and the distant hills echoed by the rise and fall of steep gables. “We’re super proud of these rooftops,” says Greg LoPiccolo. “It’s an amazing landscape that we put a lot of thought and effort into, and it’s a lot of fun to traverse.”
Back in 1998, LoPiccolo was the game director who saw Thief: The Dark Project to completion. Today - after an 18 year detour to Harmonix to lead projects like Guitar Hero and Rock Band, among other adventures - he’s the game director of Thick as Thieves. “It really is an opportunity to do something unique and cool and new, on the shoulders of this stuff that is now well-respected,” he says. “Thief has some legs, right? People still talk about it to some degree.”

When Victory Heat Rally first appeared on Kickstarter back in 2020, the game appeared set to pay homage to Sega's wonderful Super Scaler range of arcade games from the 1980s. In the four years that have followed between that Kickstarter launch and this Switch release, something appears to have been lost along the way.
Rather than the Kickstarter trailer’s segmented rollercoaster-like tracks, which immediately conjured up memories of Seger's brilliant arcade racer Power Drift, instead the tracks in Victory Heat Rally look a lot more like the typical 3D environments expected from a modern racing game, albeit with cel shading designed to deliberately make them look more basic.

Just saying, this had better be good, Geoff, especially after the 2023 show’s "embarrassing" shooing-off of developers whose acceptance speeches cut into that valuable trailer showcase time.
Who will need to please wrap it up this time? Which games will be revealed? Will there be a musical number to top last year’s Herald of Darkness performance? (That was fun, actually, fair play on that one.) You can find out right along with us, as we once again fire up the RPS liveblog-o-tron to report all the developments as they happen. Even the ones that happen at 3:45am, when I’ll be desperately trying not to collapse into my keyboard like a felled tree.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At first I thought Marvel Rivals was basically rebranded Overwatch, in the way it's a free-to-play PVP hero shooter. And in some ways, it is. Fights are like if you took a MOBA and forced both teams to bash heads constantly. Success lies in picking off Spider-Man or Squirrel Girl or Marcus Fenix so as they wait to respawn, you hop on the big area that needs capturing. Or you push the cart while tanky Hulk absorbs bullets with his biceps and John Marvel snipes from afar.
The more I played Rivals, though, the more it hit me that it's specifically a messier, more complex Overwatch. A hero shooter with a surprising amount of polish and charm, sure, but also one that slides off my brain like water off Birdman's back. I understand why it's supremely popular at the moment and yet, I really don't.

I’ve engineered a Bloodsucker attack that wiped out the worst of villains – someone who was mean to me – and I’ve progressed far enough to really open up the map, and with it, access to more of the Zone’s fiercest fleshwarps.
Also, rats. Buoyed by the successful Bloodsucker siccing, I’m back on the trail of some mysterious anomaly scanners, and word is I might find a lead inside a local maze of wrecked cars. It’s heavily guarded by some gangster types, but for once, I won’t have to dash off in search of some far-off muties and coax them back here using my neck as bait. Mercifully, a gaggle of overgrown rodents are already hopping around right outside the labyrinth’s entrance. I beckon them in like a bouncer on his last day, then sprint past the stunned gunmen, who can barely shoulder their rifles before being set upon by a pack of giant carnivorous hamsters.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In more ways than one, today’s Total War: Warhammer 3 expansion marks a milestone for game director Rich Aldridge and his team at Creative Assembly. Omens Of Destruction’s three headline legendary lords each bring new campaigns and units for their respective factions, but it’s the fourth lord - a Khorne champion free to all players - that I imagine Aldridge will end up remembering the most fondly.
When Total War: Warhammer released back in 2016, it shipped with eight legendary lords - famous characters from Games Workshop’s fantasy setting that here act as faction leaders. The number grew steadily and, in terms of announcement order at least, today’s addition of Arbaal The Undefeated marks the series’ 100th. That's a hundred campaigns, a hundred joint efforts of game design, animation, art, writing and voice work.
Aldridge has never been shy about the team’s ambition for the series to eventually offer up each unit from every Fantasy Battle 6th edition army book ("The goal is to do everything, right?"). But ambition is one thing, and considering the fraught conditions at Creative Assembly and parent company Sega over the past few years, it’s not just the addition of the 100th lord that feels like something to celebrate. It’s taken time, effort, and a siesmic shift in update frequency, but Total War: Warhammer III is in the best place it's ever been.

It seems to play a bit like XCOM, with an oppressive world map that is slowly encroached upon as you travel around recruiting soldiers, interacting with settlements, and picking real-time fights with hellfiends "inspired by biblical descriptions and European folklore". Naturally, parallels with real-life xenophobia and sectarian hatred abound. Here's the trailer.

For most of us, Steam simply slurps down fresh gigs of installed games automatically when a new update is released (and sometimes schedules the updates according to its own capricious whims). But the platform is testing a new option in the beta client, which lets you set download behaviour to git new gigs only when you actually launch a game. This would be a terrible curse, for reasons I will explain, but it's only going to be an option - not the new default.

Rock Paper Shotgun’s CMS (content management system) even has a built-in widget that shouts at me if I don’t write at least 250 words. "Page 1 body content is quite short" it says if I go under.

Anyway, I bring this up because I honestly don’t have anything to add about Blippo+. I just wanted to inform you all of its existence.

One person sloughs off a piece of themselves, shapes it, wraps it, and sends it out into the world in the hope that it might mean something to someone else. Other people do this for us all the time and mostly we don't even notice. The work is unseen and unremarked upon even as, through repetition, we come to depend upon it. Until, one day, that light that they shine can't be seen. Maybe you left home, or maybe they did, but now it's your turn to perform such acts of kindness. To carry the tradition forward for others - and for yourself.

Friends, it's time to play Skeal.

Curiosmos is a very different game, but it has a little of the same appeal. It's a galactic playground in which you smash meteors together to make planets, then tinker with the ecosystems of those planets to make life and watch that life evolve.

A similar horde vs horde encounter is underway at POE 2 developers Grinding Gear Games.

Quite specific of you, but a new documentary from Noclip might just have what you’re looking for. The Past, Present & Future of Soul Reaver interviews key developers from the action adventure game, and about halfway through host Danny O’ Dwyer gets hold of some archive materials, including old audition tapes. These include Mark Hamill reading for Janos Audren, and Jennifer Hale for Ariel.
The biggest treat, of course, is hearing Hayter read for Raziel, especially as it’s that excellent opening monologue. You’ll find the video below, with Hayter around 37:30.

Update 2.2 went live yesterday, bringing with it a host of fixes, as well as some deeper customisation options for both your character and vehicles. The base game is also 55% off on Steam until the 18th of December, with the Phantom Liberty expansion at 20% off, or both in a 48% off bundle. Cyberpunk is on sale often enough, although these current discounts line up with the cheapest it's ever been on Steam. Again: worth it for the line.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pity the "relaxing" games which set out to blanket their players in a wholesome fog. These minimalist or slight experiences set their stall against the mainstream philosophy of video game design focused on action, rules, clear progression, and often violence. So it is with Naiad, a sometimes pleasant swim down a river in which you sing to make flowers grow and discover poems by interacting with birds, bees, butterflies and other fauna. 

Yet here's the cause of my pity. All those other games, with their decisive action, systemic consequence, and neck-snapping: I was playing those to relax, too. Why else would I have snapped all those necks? Being shorn of base pleasures does not make Naiad a restorative oasis amid a desert of stressful video games, and it doesn't make it more relaxing than its peers. In fact, it makes for an experience that left me restless, even a little anxious, when it made me feel anything at all.

Whichever it is, Little Rocket Lab is a factory-builder about efficiently placing conveyors and robot arms, and is drawn in the warm, pixel art small-town of a Stardew-like. That sounds like a fitting combination, although it does mean you're building a NASA-sized rocketship on the outskirts of your quaint hometown. That can't be good for noise pollution. There's an announcement trailer below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Marvel Rivals, the free-to-play hero shooter from NetEase, launched late last week and is exceedingly popular. It's currently fourth on the Steam daily most played, right between Path Of Exile 2 and the evergreen Grand Theft Auto 5. I think there are three reasons for this enthusiasm: 1) it's free-to-play with the usual comet's tail of microtransactables 2) it's third-person Overwatch with Marvel characters, a straightforwardly enticing licensing sandwich, and 3) people want to have sex with a larger-than-usual proportion of the cast and especially awful tongue-monster Venom, who has a good butt in this one. No, I'm not going to share pictures. You'll have to google that filth yourself.


But perhaps you are a sophisticated soul who has no time for such salacious nonsense. You're more interested in hearing how they're patching the thing. Enough with the butts already, dang it - this is a new multiplayer game so there must, of course, be patches! Fair enough: here's what NetEase are changing or fixing in the first major update, out now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I feel guilty about repeatedly comparing Nebulous: Fleet Command to Homeworld, inasmuch as it's an appalling bait-and-switch. It's like offering somebody a cake that is actually a cunningly painted hunk of torpedo fuselage. It's like offering to shake hands while wearing one of those comedy hand buzzers - except that the hand buzzer is an intricate simulation of zero-G physics, missile behaviours and comms jamming, featuring spacecraft with proper internal layouts that require you to think hard about attitude control if you don't want, say, your engines to become Swiss cheese about 90 seconds before you need to retreat from combat. 


Being a "true" 3D real-time space strategy game, Nebulous looks and sounds a lot like Homeworld on the surface, but it's nothing like as straightforward. It is systems within systems. It is a game in which you can, theoretically, plot the path of a single guided munition through an asteroid field, so as to catch an enemy cruiser in the back. I barely understand how to make a ship fire on another ship, using plain old armour-piercing shells, and now they're threatening to add carriers, fighters and bombers. Customisable ones! The humanity. Here's a trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[London Gatwick Airport is a rare shade of brown, known to neither science nor art. A brown that doesn’t appear on the light spectrum. No easel contains it. It is a dusty brown, a damp brown, a hot and earthy brown that hums with the stinging malodour of disturbed ancient moss where once old forests stood. Descending into Gatwick’s cloying brown from 33,000 feet is like flying under and up Gandalf’s wretched cloak and landing in one of the several horrible little magic pouches he keeps by his balls.
Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 captures Gatwick’s brown perfectly. Next to the stupefying natural beauty of Yosemite, the imposing imperial skyscrapers of the Manhattan skyline and the surging majesty of the Alpine peaks, this local rot-tinged patch of West Sussex is the most impressively realistic depiction of a place I have seen in a game.

It's basic physics. In this case, I was on holiday from Friday through Monday, and this fact and this fact alone appears to have coaxed some toy manufacturer into taking the internet's most cherished indie gaming platform offline by means of a "bogus" phishing report, sent by "AI-powered" brand protection software.
The situation has now been resolved, thankfully, and you can access Itch.io as normal, but I will never pass up the opportunity to cast shade on Funko Pop, whose NFT-garlanded bobbleheads I hate as I do veruccas and forest fires. So here's a quick recap if you, too, missed the drama.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve got a strange relationship with the stealth sandbox murderbox that is Hitman: World of Assassination. If you were to ask me to list my favourite games, the latest Hitman trilogy would be in the top five, no question. And yet, I must have gotten intimidated at some point with the amount of new updates and all the spiffy unlockable suits I was missing out on, and just haven’t touched it in a couple of years now. Is the appearance of Jean-Claude Van Damme as the game’s newest elusive target enough to reel me back in? I'm not sure, but I will say that I doubt Sean Bean can stretch his legs like that, even with the legendary flexibility offered by O2's famously variable plans. Here’s a trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If we follow Marshall McLuhan’s ideas about technology being an extension of the body, then the copy and paste keyboard shortcuts are my equivalent of a trip to one of Cyberpunk 2077’s ripperdocs. In the writing of this single article, I will use them for links, HTML code, and other ephemera. I even copied McLuhan’s name across from a different tab, which I’m sure he’d appreciate/be horrified by. I love those shortcuts. I need them. They are the wind beneath my wings, and the crud buildup beneath the bottom left of my keyboard.
I cannot say how the first tailor to gaze upon a sewing machine felt, nor the first egg-abacus attendant to behold the sorcerous ticking of the automated egg timer. But I think now that when they saw those things, they were afraid. As I am afraid now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m quite smitten by the Nintendo DS stylings and traditional roguelike charms of Shiren the Wanderer: The Mystery Dungeon Of Serpentcoil Island, but I’m having real trouble summoning up the motivation to repeatedly grind through its opening levels to get to the interesting stuff. Early stages soon lose any real sense of surprise, and later ones can feel low on real agency. I want a new roguelike run to feel vital and verdant; heady with grand plans and plan-shattering twists. But by having randomness influence each run so significantly, Mystery Dungeon feels fickle instead of emergent - less than the sum of some incredibly novel and creative parts.

Well, you'll know by the end of the week, as the studio is planning to reveal this at Geoff Keighley's winter festival of expensive advertising, the Game Awards. However, there may already be some clues in a trailer they've just released, which suggests some sisterful slapping is overdue. The trailer also promises new moves for all characters in a Season 2 update next spring, along with some minor presents in a winter update due sooner than that. But yes, come see for yourself.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's not just because he's a Nazi. It's because he's a smartass Nazi. As the main antagonist in Indiana Jones And The Great Circle, Emmerich Voss vacates the archetypal armchair usually reserved for secondary fascist goons, so that he can goosestep straight into the big boy seat himself. He smiles with all the sleaze of right-hand-man Major Toht, the grubby gestapo who gets that right hand burned in Raiders of the Lost Ark. Yet he also engages in the pseudo-intellectual trash talk of the main archaeological rivals to Jones, like Rene Belloq or Walter Donovan. He is a hideous grab bag of all the things that make an instantly detestable villain in the series. But there's something else. Voss is so immediately and gutturally hateable because he resembles a type of racist encountered not in the 1930s, but one you've probably met today: the asshole you meet on the internet.
Warning: Here be spoilers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The only sound that greets you upon booting up Eclipsium is a loudly throbbing heart. As one must when encountering horror media, the game and I immediately enter a spiritual staring contest, each of us knowing the real game here was it trying to freak me out. "It’s fine", I decided. "It’s just a heart! I’ve got a heart. It’s actually very useful. Nothing to be scared of". Thing is, Eclipsium’s menu heart is actually massive and sits, like The Eye Of Sauron, atop a giant obelisk. “Ah. That’s definitely a horror thing, that” I was forced to admit. "If my heart was on a giant obelisk, I’d be proper shaken up, I reckon."
So starts Eclipsium’s very first bit of aggressive disorientation, and it basically just escalates from there. I obviously can’t describe the vibes without slightly spoiling the vibes, so do pop over to Steam for a demo if you’re curious and, oh, there’s a potted plant, the sound of its rustling mixed in such a way that it sort of sounds like it’s shrieking at me. Well.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[“Hang on a sec. Haven’t I seen this exact genre of little guy before?” was my reaction upon encountering the yellow-eyed, hat-shrouded mage of isometric adventure Oolo. Some quick internet sleuthing turned up this lovely bit of art featuring Final Fantasy 9’s Vivi, Journey’s Traveller, and He-Man’s Orko. It’s a great feeling to begin your week identifying an archetype of diminutive magician, and I hope it becomes a regular occurrence. Another pleasant  discovery was Oolo itself, which you can discover yourself through the shrouded magic of this link to it’s free demo.
(Do I need to keep writing ‘free demo’, by the way? I tend to alternate. It’s obviously redundant but I feel writing ‘free’ gives it a certain gravitas. Free tax rebate. Free sunrise. Free oxygen. It makes things sound better.)

No, the Maw's penchant remains for new PC game releases, and thankfully, they are as thick on the ground as reindeer pelts.

U zrodu tohoto počinu stálo elektronické hudební duo Daft Punk, které v roce 2001 vydalo své album "Discovery". K písničkám z alba vyšly animované videoklipy, které produkoval Leidži Macumoto, což byl kultovní japonský výtvarník (zemřel loni), který měl na svém kontě mnoho animovaných seriálů, především ze 70. - 80. let (nejslavnější z nich byl asi "Space Battleship Yamato"). Daft Punk ho oslovili proto, že na jeho seriálech vyrůstali, takže výsledné dílo, včetně "jednodušší" retro animace a naivní zápletky zcela záměrně připomíná staré japonské televizní počiny (n…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Greece is buzzing with news of a historic, landmark decision by a local court, to imprison a person for five months for subscribing to a pirate IPTV service. The news warrants an informed conversation about creators' rights and how the judicial system has sharpened its response to piracy. However, until evidence is produced to the contrary, the story should be stamped "propaganda" and noted for an offense of its own: a distraction from genuine progress in the fight against piracy.

Of the co-op escape room games I've played, it was the best, both in terms of its relatively neutral framing (with little heavyhanded storytelling) and its pretty solid puzzle design. The game was expanded in the time since with a versus mode and several crossover DLC, and now there comes a sequel.

Escape Simulator 2 will explore "darker escape room themes", looks visually more detailed, and comes with a new editor for those who wish to design their own escape rooms.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The protagonists of two of my all time favourite RPGs share something in common. Both (the best Final Fantasy game) Final Fantasy 8’s Squall and The Witcher 3’s Geralt simply cannot get enough of leaving their friends and the entire world in mortal peril while they sneak in a quick round of cards, and I love them for it. Way back when the Wild Hunt released, there was a special edition kicking about that gave you a few decks for Gwent - the fleshed-out, playable card distraction that ended up being responsible for some of the game’s best moments. I pined for those decks, but I never acquired them. Now, Hatchette Board Games is putting out a full physical edition of Gwent next year.
The set contains "over 400 cards and a playmat" for £44/$39.99. I’m still recovering from various Fantasy Flight LCGs, so my value sense for this stuff might be a bit skewed, but that strikes me as incredibly reasonable. A good Gwent deck consists of only about 25 cards. They’re not bad cards, either! I’ve got a real pet hate for tabletop versions of videogames that just use in-engine screenshots for the cards, but these ones look to have the proper artwork from the game on them:

Why, I remember it like it was March, and not actually Summer, when the delightful free game about a mucky pomeranian was unleashed into the world. Yep, yep. It was definitely March. Roughly translating to ‘covered in mud doggy’, the game set you the task of racking up tangible financial damage to your owner’s house by getting mud everywhere - first by normal dog means, and then with giant mud cannons. You can grab it for free on Steam here.
It stole our hearts, it did. And talking of stealing things and having a good time doing it, it’s also releasing on the Nintendo Switch soon, which means the Steam version of Doronko Wanko is getting some free DLC to celebrate. It isn’t arriving until next Spring, but it’s bringing three new mystery dog breeds with it when it does.

The Hitlerites and blackshirts of Indiana Jones And The Great Circle sneeze and cough as they patrol the dig sites of Gizeh, or the marble corridors of the Vatican. Although this is the Machine Games' clever way of letting you know where your enemies are at all times, it is also mildly funny, as if all the Nazis have been secretly kissing each other, spreading the same rhinovirus from Italy to Egypt to Nepal and beyond. More than that, it's a stubborn reminder that, despite the many hours of perfectly motion-captured cinematics that accompany all this, you are still playing a video game. A snotty tissue that separates the Indy of taut two-hour cinema and the Indy of a sweeping first-person punch 'em up that will take days to complete. All this is to say, you will notice the difference. But that might not matter; they're both still Indiana Jones.

At best. I’d successfully lured some bandits into the deadly lair of a bucket-tossing Poltergeist, but several attempts at more actively siccing mutated pigs on the Zone’s human baddies had all failed, even when I’d seemed to actually tame one.
Now, my only friend lay dead at my feet, and I’m in dire need of some new beasts to master. And some cash. It turns out that a fighting style that involves letting shopping trolley-sized swine creatures chew on my heels is bad for the ol’ HP, and having recently blown my savings on half a sausage, I’m forced to shift focus from my current debt collection mission towards a means to fill my own coffers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I think It’s safe to say that Trigger Happy Interactive’s upcoming survival horror Total Chaos is a bit of a palette change from their last offering - the frenetic, neon-drenched, chainsaw-legged Turbo Overkill. Still, it’s not often we see psychological horror combined with ultraviolence, and anything that gives off even a whiff of Condemned: Criminal Origins has my attention.
Total Chaos started life as a popular Doom 2 mod, and while I dare the say the limitations of that game sell the atmosphere a little better than this much sleeker update, I certainly trust Trigger Happy enough to make the most of the new engine. The game is set in New Oasis, a “once bustling haven for coal miners” that is now most definitely not bustling, nor haven-like.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nightdive, you done good. The Thing: Remastered is an ultra-sharp and commendably playable update to a game that history will remember as ‘actually a pretty good pick at Choices when you really just popped in to get some Revels but got embarrassed when the till staffer said “is that everything?” in a tone that could have been neutral but equally could have been a damning indictment of your character’.
I’m being slightly facetious here, of course. History actually remembers Computer Artworks’s 2002 shooty horror game for how incredibly ambitious and conceptually inventive its proto-sus social squad system was. In homage to the body-snatching alien paranoia of Carpenter’s 1982 horror classic, The Thing tasks you with not just assembling and directing a squad, but keeping them from breaking down or turning on you - in fear you might be hosting the titular molecular stowaway.

Perhaps surprisingly, most video game houses do not shapeshift. Despite being made out of pure imagination and carbon emissions, they remain nostalgically shackled to the limitations of brick, mortar and Euclidean geometry. Blue Prince’s abode is different. It is a house made of house. You’ll actually design the layout yourself every time you wander through it, picking from a selection of mismatched room types whenever you open a door.

It is, of course, very punk of me to recognise this. However, this hasn’t stopped every other videogame released in the last 74 years trying to coin their own punk subgenre. The latest to do so is ‘brinepunk’ FPS Abyssus, which seems to have mostly arrived at the terms by being ‘a bit Steampunk, but underwater’. Abyssus looks cool, and so with the power vested in me by the Greggs vegan sausage roll I had for lunch today, I hereby declare that this is the last game allowed to do this. Let’s see if it’s making the most of it, at least.

If you, personally, are reading RPS while falling off a mountain at this very moment, I’m afraid I can’t help you. Luckily, if you bonk your head on Steam on the way down, you’ll find a demo for stylish open world climbing game Cairn, which should hopefully distract you from your imminent pancaking.
Cairn is from The Game Bakers, of Furi and Haven fame. We first saw it at the Day Of The Devs this year. I was fresh off the lovely Jusant at the time. “Ah, another relaxing and whimsical French game about mountain climbing!” I thought. I was a fool. It’s far more intense, this one, although there are dashes of Breath Of The Wild and Death Stranding to add some whimsy and wonder to your Sisyphean struggle. Plus, it's very pretty. Here’s some new footage, or possibly some old footage depending on badly the embargo has messed up my schedule.

Což je diametrální rozdíl oproti skvěle promyšlenému "Tísňovému volání". (Ilča 50 %)]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We've been working for a while on the next ScummVM release, and it is time for a call for public testing.
Support for a number of new engines and games for the existing ones was added, and we need your special attention to the following titles:
Orion Burger.
Total Eclipse and Total Eclipse 2.
Thimbleweed Park.
The Space Bar.
Moonbase Commander. (with multiplayer support)
Backyard Basketball.
Unrest.
Rise of the Dragon.
Castle Master.
Wait for it! Issue 3. Song for a Hare. (Ну, погоди! Выпуск 3. Песня для зайца)
Mask Show. (Маски-шоу)
Marvellous Mice Adventures: Meeting Sea Rat. (Три маленькие белые мышки. Визит Морской крысы)
The Adventures of the Good Soldier Schweik. (Похождения бравого солдата Швейка)
Marvellous Mice Adventures: Sea Rat's Birthday. (Три маленькие белые мышки. День рождения морской крысы)
Besides these newly supported games, almost half of the current 108 engines have notable changes. Thus, testing more games is always a good thing.
All testing must be done with stable builds, not development ones. Please report bugs or oddities on our issue tracker.
A detailed list of all exciting new features and fixes is available in our NEWS file.
We are looking forward to your reports about successful and unsuccessful playthroughs and bugs reported!

Scénář není hloupý a nabízí pár námětů k zamyšlení nad tím, jak funguje víra. Bohužel, ke konci se film trochu neuspořádaně rozutíká do různých směrů, jako by se tvůrci neuměli rozhodnout, o čem to vlastně celé bylo. (Ilča 65 %)]]></summary>

Debutující scenárista a režisér Vojtěch Strakatý nám přináší drama děvčete, které netuší, co si počít.


Existuje vícero českých filmů, které surfují na oblíbené vlně "zakažte exekutory, zrušte dluhy, je to nelidské!" (například Tancuj Matyldo). After Party takovým filmem není. Exekutoři se v něm chovají korektně a slušně a vinu na situaci celé rodiny nese naprosto jednoznačně otec, který neopatrně investoval, i když nevíme jak.
