Last year, The Pokémon Company shocked some long-time western trading card collectors when it announced it would be ditching the iconic yellow borders in the Pokémon Trading Card Game.
As of Scarlet and Violet, local cards will now feature a silver coloured border - bringing the western designs in line with the Japanese variants. If you've been wondering what these cards look like in the flesh, the official Pokémon social media accounts have now shared a look at some of the generation nine lineup - showcasing Smoliv, Cetoddle and Lechonk:

Perhaps the biggest announcement of the most recent Nintendo Direct was Metroid Prime Remastered. It was even launched on the same day via the eShop, with the physical version to arrive at a later date.
Now, after a few weeks of waiting, the hard copy of the game is finally available in the US and across North America. NoA's senior vice president of creative and planning Chad Concelmo even issued a friendly reminder on social media:

Most city-builders are about expanding and growing. The goal is to take a natural, untamed world and bend it to your benefit, turning the realm into a humming machine for resources and production. Terra Nil, however, does the inverse.
Rather than creating a monument to your designs, Terra Nil is a reverse city-builder from BroForce studio Free Lives. It asks you to take the barren, scorched earth and fill it with life. You restore the grasslands, let water flow down canals, and crack the earth to restore the ecosystem. And then, at the end, you pack up and leave, with only nature in your wake.

Prepare your disc-slots, as Kaizen Game Works' neon-sleuthing adventure Paradise Killer will be getting a physical release via Serenity Forge in the third quarter of 2023. This is in addition to the Switch version, whose physical prison is being provided by 1Print Games. However, their limited edition is lacking in one important area: tits.
Now that I have your attention, I feel it’s important to point out that the Serenity Forge Collector’s Edition comes with a mouse pad prominently featuring Crimson Acid’s divine rack. There are some other things in there, like acrylic standees, stickers, and an OST download card, but those all pale in comparison to the inviting bosom of the demon-headed sex idol.

If you’re unfamiliar with Paradise Killer, it’s a free-roaming detective game soaked in weirdities. I loved it for its excellent characters, outstanding writing, and open approach to investigation. I think my only real complaint about it was a rather drab open world. However, it still rents space in my head, and I keep getting the urge to replay it.
As someone who passionately loved Paradise Killer back at launch, this is a really tempting package for me. Not sure I’ll go for the Collector’s Edition. Listen, Crimson Acid is certainly more fuckable than a chocolate éclair, but I’m not sure I need to nestle my wrist in her ergonomic cleavage. That sounds… sweaty.
Paradise Killer is available on Switch, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PS4, PS5, and PC. The Switch Physical version is available now from 1Print Games, while the titular PlayStation and Xbox versions will be hitting retail from Serenity Forge.

A message reading, "HMMM found an incoming message about some Impostors that might be hiding among a certain fireteam very soon..." was posted to the game's Twitter account on February 21, but had no further information included. Various silhouettes were also featured in an image that accompanied the tweet and the phrase "Eyes up, crewmate." Destiny 2's Commander Zavala has the catchphrase, "Eyes up, Guardian," which fans have taken to mean the teaser definitely refers to Destiny.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The pen is mightier
Plastic carnage is coming to Steam Early Access on March 17 by way of Joystick Ventures and Kraken Empire’s Toy Tactics.
Toy Tactics is described as a “family-friendly, physics-based RTS” where you draw on the map to direct your troops. I’m going to stop you there because the moment you let me draw anything, it’s going to stop being family-friendly. At best, I’m going to draw a butt. My flag in Animal Crossing? A butt. It’s inevitable.
[embed]https://youtu.be/BwryoUr8LTU[/embed]
On top of confronting your enemies with the dreaded butt-formation, you’ll also cast spells to add catapults, walls, and meteors to aid your troops. You can choose Imperium, Pendragon, and Kyoukai armies, each with their own unique abilities. The single-player campaign will have your forces traversing “Draugr infested Europe and Japan.”
Whenever these toy-based games come up, I always hope they really go off the deep end in terms of taking advantage of the theme. It’s certainly looking like Toy Tactics is going that route by throwing in samurai alongside ancient European factions. However, I won’t be happy until I see a few robots and toy kaiju stomping all over the battlefield.
Toy Tactics will hit Steam Early Access on March 17. No word yet on how long it plans to remain there, but you can check out the demo right now.

Honestly, it's a miracle that Mr. Munchakoopas (to use his full name) ever made it back into our hearts after that, given that we'd only ever known him as an excuse to try to capitalise on Tetris' success, and an expendable resource in Super Mario World that helps Mario get extra height on his jump.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Walking right over the minefield sign
Valve confirms it has permanently banned over 40,000 accounts associated with a known cheat in Dota 2. And it did so by creating a trap laid specifically just to lure users of that specific cheat out.
In a blog entitled "Cheaters Will Never Be Welcome in Dota," Valve outlines how exactly this came to be. The company doesn't name the cheat or what it did, but does confirm that the software was able to access information used internally by the Dota 2 client that "wasn't visible during normal gameplay."
Though fixing the cheat was important, Valve also decided to remove those using the cheat from the active playerbase. So as soon as the studio understood the methodology behind the cheat, Valve issued a patch that created a honeypot. A section of game data inside the client would never be read during normal gameplay, but it could be read by the cheats.
As you might imagine, this cordoned-off area created a ledger of users who were using the exploit. Valve says it has "extremely high confidence" that every ban was "well-deserved."
The ongoing fight with cheats
As Valve highlights, the tussle between developers and cheat-creators wages ever-on in the shadows. While some efforts get the spotlight, especially when they head to court, it's fascinating to see behind the curtain a bit on how Valve identified and trapped a bunch of cheat-users.
"We expect that some players will continue to develop and use new exploits, to continue to try to gain unfair advantages at the expense of other players," reads today's blog. "As before, we will continue to detect and remove these exploits as they come, and continue to ban users who cheat."
Right now, the Dota 2 Lima Major is taking place, and a new update is set to be unveiled on March 6. For those who decide to jump back in, they can do so knowing there are roughly 40,000 less cheaters in the pool.

Publisher Serenity Forge has announced that visual novel adventure Doki Doki Literature Club Plus! has sold over one million copies since its initial launch on PC and consoles in the summer of 2021.
Doki Doki Literature Club puts players in the role of a new student, begrudgingly roped into joining their new school's poetry club, where they meet fellow teenage scribes Sayori, Natsuki, Yuri, and the club's president, Monika. The expanded Plus! edition features the original game in its entirety, freshly polished with remastered visuals, as well as a glut of new features and additional side stories, providing the ultimate romantic experience for both new and returning fans.
https://twitter.com/TeamSalvato/status/1628168687680393216?s=20
"These past five years, seeing my writing reach so many people has helped to shape who I am," said original creator Dan Salvato of the sales. "I feel so connected to every Doki Doki Literature Club! fan I have the privilege of meeting. In my gratitude to all our supporters, I’m committed to using our funding from Doki Doki Literature Club Plus! to support mental health nonprofits, as well as to make new boundary-breaking games that can create connection and meaning for even more people."
Initially launched as a Steam indie release back in 2017, positive word of mouth would see the original Doki Doki Literature Club hit an amazing 13 million downloads. The now iconic release would receive high praise from critics and players for its intriguing nature, evolving story, memorable characters, and meta qualities, all of which facilitate an experience quite unlike that which might have been originally expected.

This past September, we were sad to report that the massive Sega GiGO Building 4 arcade located in the Tokyo borough of Akihabara was closing after being a staple spot for 11 years. It seemed like an unfortunate victim of Japan’s shrinking arcade market. However, this past January, it was reported that the site would become a Bandai Namco Arcade in its place, set to open this March.
Thanks to Genki_JPN on Twitter, we now have a look at the building’s new facade.
https://twitter.com/Genki_JPN/status/1627337359166701569?s=20
While I was in Japan back in 2014, I paid a visit to the Sega GiGo location in Akihabara. However, I’d have difficulty accurately differentiating it from the other game centers I visited in the area. It was at the end of a two-week journey through the country, I was very tired, it was raining, and I was carrying around a backpack roughly the size and weight of a dairy cow. If I’m thinking of the right place, though, I played Kiki Kaikai, Typing of the Dead, F-Zero AX, and won an awesome chibi Naoto Shiragane figure in one attempt on one of the crane machines.
The fact that one arcade is being directly replaced with another is some comfort. The arcade industry has pretty much disappeared entirely in most areas (especially mine) in the past few decades here in North America. Going to Japan and being able to take a seat at a cabinet is a wonderful experience. However, it’s maybe worth noting that the Bandai Namco locations tend to lean heavier on crane machines. While those are fun, too, they’re not as satisfying as row upon row of new and classic games.
Still! The building is remaining an arcade, and that’s key. We’ll see Bandai Namco’s approach to the business when it opens in March 2023.

Ready to wreck some Reploids once again? Grab your pick-axe because this time, the virus-ridden mavericks are invading by way of new Mega Man X DLC, which is now available for Minecraft.
This fat pack brings you recreations of classic stages thickened with the magic of voxels. Within, you can do battle with some of Mega Man X’s most recognizable mavericks, including Chill Penguin, Storm Eagle, Armored Armadillo, and something Chameleon. I’ve played through the SNES title about a million times; look at how great my memory is!
https://youtu.be/IUWRK0Jy9d0
Along the way, you’ll also collect upgrades for your gear. You can even bring some friends along to help rid the world of Sigma. You’ll get 14 skins in the package. This is also accompanied by the classic Mega Man X soundtrack, which I recognize as the music that is endlessly bouncing around the inside of my skull.
I haven’t played Minecraft since it was still in beta. I keep thinking I should get back into it to see what it’s like now, but I’m pretty sure in order to do so, I’d need to set aside a week or two of my life and have a detox planned for after. As such, I have no idea how these DLC packs work. I guess they’re like games within the game.
What I do know is that the DLC pack can be bought for 1340 Minecraft coins. I don’t know what those are, but I’m told that it equals out to roughly $8.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Universe-spanning survival sim No Man’s Sky is releasing its 4.1 Fractal Update today, bringing along a new Expedition, tons of accessibility options, a VR overhaul, and much more. Developers Hello Games have updated the game so consistently their launch woes are a distant memory, sent to a faraway galaxy. Since then, No Man’s Sky has become a not just a space exploration game, but a city management sim and a generally nice place to chill with your odd alien pets, all in one package.

Blumhouse Productions, the film production company behind a litany of modern horror classics, has announced the establishment of new division Blumhouse Games, with which it expects to oversee the development and publishing of independent horror releases on PC, console, and mobile platforms.
The new gaming division plans to work alongside indie developers with the creation, marketing and publishing of their own titles. Following its initial movie model, Blumhouse Games is expected to focus on lower-budgeted titles, spreading the word with impactful marketing and ensuring a fast and lucrative turnaround. The new division will be led by Zach Wood, a journeyman within the gaming industry who has worked as a producer for the best part of 25 years…]]></summary>

The Nintendo Switch Online service is, slowly but surely, becoming quite an enticing prospect for Nintendo fans. In addition to enabling online play, the biggest draw for potential subscribers is undoubtedly its legacy games service (plus that sweet Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Booster Course Pass, of course).
Starting off with just the NES back in 2018, the service — if you subscribe to the Expansion Pack tier — now supports the NES, SNES, Sega Genesis/Mega Drive, N64, Game Boy, and Game Boy Advance. Granted, not all are equal in terms of the size of their respective catalogues, but there's definitely plenty here for fans to sink their teeth into.

Instead of waxing lyrical about that though, I'm here today with good news: My favourite open world 3D spaceflight/trading sim Hardwar is back.
It's been back for over a year, in fact, via Zoom Platform, who've just made the interesting choice to publish it on Steam too, promising that their own store will remain resolutely DRM-free, and that this aims "to help fund additional signings and improvements for our DRM-Free preservation efforts". I'll brush aside analysing this strategy, because the immediate upshot is that, hopefully, Hardwar might finally get its due. In a better world, we'd already be playing its modern descendants.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just shy of Mar. 10
Nintendo has announced a new Super Mario Bros. Movie Direct, which will host the final trailer for the animated film. This Direct will air on March 9 at 5 p.m. ET / 2 p.m. PT.
The stream is being hosted on Nintendo's channels, and will specifically focus on the final trailer. Nintendo notes in the description:
"Join us at 2:00 p.m. PT on 3/9 for the world premiere of The Super Mario Bros. Movie's final trailer! No game information will be included in this #NintendoDirect."

Bad news for any Mario game hopefuls out there, I suppose. But hey, it looks like we'll get a good glimpse of what's in store for this animated Mario adaptation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66j31wFLB_s
The trailer image does tease many of the central characters, including Mario, Peach, Toad, and Donkey Kong, racing along the Rainbow Road. And I'd pump the brakes if I were Mario, because that Blue Shell is coming in hot.
Drifting along the rainbow highway
The Super Mario Bros. Movie is pretty well lined-up for its April premiere, which isn't all that far off. This animated version of the Mushroom Kingdom looks to put its own spin on the story, with Mario as an isekai'd plumber transported into the wild, wild world of the Mario games.
And honestly, it's looked pretty alright through most of the trailers. Chris Pratt's Mario voice is one thing, but I'd spend the movie theater ticket price just to see more of Jack Black's Bowser. It really does seem like produciton studio Illumination is having fun digging back through the years of the Mario franchise, too.
At the very least, I'm hopeful for an entertaining romp that's light-hearted, got some good gags, and isn't over three hours long. Seriously, that's become my least-favorite trend in blockbuster movies lately. The Super Mario Bros. Movie premieres on April 7.

We have known of Peppa Pig: World Adventures for a while now, and although the children's TV star is not set to fly onto Switch until 17th March, that hasn't stopped the good folk at Outright Games from releasing an all-new gameplay trailer to show Peppa in action.
Much like its predecessor My Friend Peppa Pig, this looks like it is going to be a gentler gaming experience, but if it can live up to the love that some share for the former title then it won't be doing too badly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlayStation VR2 launches today, and the new VR version of Resident Evil Village alongside it. However, fans have wondered about the status of the previously announced PS VR2 port of the upcoming Resident Evil 4 remake that was briefly teased last year. Capcom has finally broken its silence with a small update.
In a press release, Capcom states that development has officially begun on Resident Evil 4’s VR mode. Additionally, this update will be released as free DLC. Unfortunately, Capcom doesn’t provide a release window, but if the studio has only now commenced serious work on the mode with RE4 a month away from launch, it seems unlikely that PS VR2 owners will be gunning down Ganados in their headsets on day one. We'll just have to wait and see. 
Resident Evil 4 launches on March 24 and is Game Informer’s cover story this month. Be sure to click the banner below to find a month’s worth of exclusive features and videos dissecting the anticipated remake.]]></summary>

For the students of Sakurazaki Academy, it looks like school's out — outta luck, outta time, outta this dimension. The discovery of a dusty old mirror by mischievous demon girl Kurona has led to the popular place of learning somehow fusing with the dark arts, resulting in both the interior and the exterior of the building forming a cavernous, gothic castle, while replacing textbooks, playgrounds, and chalkboards with iron maidens, candlelit chandeliers, and a mass menagerie of demons, ghouls, and specters.
That Kurona... what a dickhead.
And while one would imagine that, for any young student, these events would be a positive boon, rivaling even the longest of snow days, it seems that most of Sakurazaki's students and faculty have found themselves trapped within this nightma…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fans of Castlevania, namely the Koji Igarashi-led titles such as Symphony of the Night, may want to keep an eye on Grim Guardians: Demon Purge. The game comes from Azure Strike Gunvolt developer Inti Creates and stars two demon-slaying sisters who must scale a monster-laden castle to rescue their high-school from destruction.
Each sister sports a unique playstyle. Shinobu fires a gun making her suited for long-ranged attacks, while Maya cuts down targets with close-ranged melee assaults. The game features two-player co-op, but playing alone lets you swap between sisters on-the-fly, each with their own health bar. This creates a unique form of strategy that we showcase in our gameplay footage below. Watch Marcus Stewart and Wesley LeBlanc explore Grim Guardian: Demon Purge's fiendish offerings to find out if it has the potential to be a worthy Castlevania successor.

Publisher Bandai Namco and developer FromSoftware have proudly announced that smash hit RPG Elden Ring has surpassed a mighty 20 million shipments and digital sales since its initial launch on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms in February 2022.
The last time sales figures were offered up for the award-winning adventure, sales and shipments were somewhere in the region of 16.5 million, meaning that Elden Ring has shifted a further 3.5 million copies in the fall and winter seasons. It is incredibly likely that the slew of Game of the Year awards received by the title, (including our own), helped to put it on the radar for those yet to hear of its plaudits.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOrtKh8Vv3g&ab_channel=Destructoid
Elden Ring, written by FromSoftware president Hidetaka Miyazaki and Game of Thrones scribe George R. R. Martin, sees the player's custom protagonist explore the grim, fallen kingdom of The Lands Between, meeting allies and enemies, battling monsters, and confronting demigods on a quest to repair the shattered "Elden Ring", said to be the anchor of order for the entire land.
Following a long and intensive period of development and marketing hype, Elden Ring launched to universal praise at the start of 2022, raising the bar for the year's releases and fending off many hopefuls to be crowned the best title of the year by a great number of outlets. PvP and other new features were added to the title in October of last year, with players eagerly anticipating further DLC later this year.
Elden Ring is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

With so much marketing fluff surrounding games, it can be nice to hear directly from the devs about their inspirations, struggles, and creative intentions. Hearing them chat candidly, making jokes and getting excited, is a good reminder that real-life people are at the heart of every game - what a crazy concept. Luckily, these types of documentaries seem to be increasingly common, evidenced by the Yakuza (or Like A Dragon) docuseries that just debuted on YouTube.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here are the full patch notes.
The developer behind No Man's Sky, Hello Games, has today announced that the space exploration title will be jetting off into ver. 4.1 with the all new Fractal update.
Much of this update makes improvements on the VR side of things, but there is still a lot of new content to be had for Switch players. This includes the introduction of the Utopia Speeder — a new starship for traversing planet surfaces at high speeds — an all new Expedition mission called 'Utopia', new rewards, access to all of the Nexus and Quicksilver missions and much more besides.

Whoa, this thing is 60 bucks?! Well, you probably want a full review. It's worth 60 bucks. Goodnight again! But seriously folks, it's worth it. Over a decade ago, it could be tough to explain to people why I was originally so drawn to Kirby's Return to Dream Land, and barely anyone even asked. Maybe it was because it released at the tail-end of the Wii's lifecycle, but peop…]]></summary>

If you’ve had a gander at our list of the Best Kirby Games Of All Time lately (or read our original 9/10 review from back in the day, more to the point) you’ll know that we hold Kirby’s Return to Dream Land in high regard around these parts. A return to classic Kirby action after a few less successful deviations from the norm (sorry Canvas Curse and Squeak Squad), this 2011 entry in the franchise was yet another super strong addition to the Nintendo Wii’s formidable roster of top-notch platformers.
Now, some 12 years down the line (what is time?) HAL Laboratory has returned to Dream Land to bring us this deluxe edition of the pink puffball’s grand return and, well, it’s still a banger. But now it’s a banger that looks much nicer, plays even better, and features more content than ever before. Yes, when they say 'Deluxe', this time they ruddy well mean it. Not only have the original game’s visuals had a delightful makeover, ditching all traces of jaggy edges for a super slick and sharp new look, but there’s also been all manner of nips, tucks, and improvements to gameplay alongside the addition of two excellent new modes to sink your teeth into. Does Kirby even have teeth?

Backpack Hero has been successful for its three-person dev team and stood apart from other roguelikes with its Tetris-inspired inventory management. You see, success in Backpack Hero is determined by how you organise your bag rather than what you’re actually carrying, as you shuffle items around a grid to create synergies and mod your playstyle.

In amongst the new weapons and stages, the account shared an upcoming feature that will make it even easier to battle with a select group of people. The 'Pools' feature will allow you to enter a unique series of characters to be added to a group with all those who have entered the same.

We are a sliver under a month away from the launch of Resident Evil 4, easily one of the most highly anticipated remakes of all time — And for those of you who want a truly immersive experience with the Los Illuminados, Capcom is developing an immersive virtual reality experience for the PS5 edition and its related PlayStation VR 2 (PSVR 2) hardware.
"VR mode for Resident Evil 4 has started development! Stay tuned for more details!” reads a new tweet from the Japanese Resident Evil Twitter account, before later adding "The VR mode of Resident Evil 4 will be distributed as free DLC for PlayStation5 / PlayStation VR 2."
https://twitter.com/BIO_OFFICIAL/status/1628309614843559937?s=20
One can only assume that the new mode for Resident Evil 4 will see players go face-to-face with some of the terrifying mutants of the iconic survival horror title, which first freaked out video game fans the world over on its initial release, way back in 2005. If you ever fancied looking one of the horrifying Regenerators, dead in the eye in full 3D, then you'll soon have the opportunity.
Also, what's wrong with you?
Resident Evil 4 VR will not be the only virtual reality experience coming to the Capcom franchise this year, as Resident Evil Village is receiving its own virtual reality equivalent today on PlayStation 5. Resident Evil Village VR lets players step into the shoes of Ethan Winters as he goes toe-to-toe with terrifying characters such as Heisenberg, Lady Dimitrescu, and, of course, that baby. Yikes.
Resident Evil 4 launches March 24 on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox Series X.

Mega Man X fans have been patiently waiting for new content from the franchise for literal years at this point. Aside from the Legacy Collection bundles released back in 2018 along with a... shall we say, enthusastic mobile game in the form of Mega Man X DiVE in 2020, we've had no original content since Mega Man X8 launched all the way back in 2004.
Well, Mega Man X is back... Sort of. But not really. The original SNES game is getting the homage treatement in brand new Minecraft x Mega Man X DLC, which is available now on Nintendo Switch. The content will include some iconic levels from the original game, 10 character skins (including X and Zero, of course), the Mega Man X soundtrack, and multiplayer support.

Last year in April, a new 3DS 16-bit tactical RPG game known as Fragrant Story was released. It's one of the few physical releases on the handheld in recent years and is also likely to be one of the last.
With the 3DS eShop closure on the horizon, the developer William Kage is now using the remaining time to pump out a few updates. The first "small patch" (Version 1.1) - out today - increases the currency reward payout and an ability's duration.

Welcome back! It’s time for a new episode of the Spot Dodge Podcast exclusively on Destructoid. Topics: Tonight we’ll be talking all about the upcoming Pokemon Presents. Along with that, a war still wages between Sony and Microsoft regarding acquiring Activision-Blizzard. A deal that will have huge ramifications across the industry, even for Nintendo. As Microsoft has signed an agreement with Nintendo to release Call of Duty and other "Xbox games" on Nintendo platforms. So much to talk about!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G44xNUznQS4&ab_channel=Destructoid
There's a high chance we get our first look at the next major Pokemon game during this week's Pokemon Presents. One area I really hope the following games are improved in is the performance. Pokemon Scarlet and Violet are still riddled with bugs and performance issues which is a shame, as they're great games to their core. Lastly, Pokemon titles are sorely missing from the latest Nintendo Switch Online announcement regarding Game Boy and Game Boy Advance games coming to the service. Tonight on Spot Dodge we'll talk all about Pokemon in 2023.
Spot Dodge is a weekly Nintendo-focused Podcast here at Destructoid where we dedicate an hour or two to go over the latest Nintendo news and discuss the games we’re playing. If you’re a fan of Nintendo Switch, RPGs, or having a good time, Spot Dodge will be a great addition to your podcast rotation. So be sure to subscribe!
Spot Dodge is streaming live every Tuesday at 4:00 p.m. PT / 7:00 p.m. ET on Twitch channel. ICYMI: We now have a dedicated Spot Dodge YouTube channel for our archived streams! All future episodes will be uploaded there.
Afterward, the show will be available on-demand for audio listeners via Spotify, Apple Podcasts, and more. The live video version will remain on Twitch until  (don’t forget to follow and subscribe). So many options!

If you’re the type that likes their games to have that new plastic smell, Moon: Remix RPG Adventure (which sometimes just goes by moon, but I refuse) is getting physical housing by way of Limited Run Games. It will come in both standard and collectors edition flavors. It’s perhaps worth noting that this is not a numbered release and, therefore, not part of the Limited Run Collection. It’s simply being distributed on Onion Games’ behalf.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Toil and trouble await in Salburg
Koei Tecmo has locked in a launch date for its remake of the first Atelier game. Atelier Marie Remake: Alchemist of Salburg is set to hit Switch, PlayStation 5, PS4, and PC via Steam on July 13, 2023.
Previously confirmed for a summer 2023 window during the recent Nintendo Direct in Japan, Atelier Marie Remake will "reintroduce" players to Marie, a struggling student at the Royal Academy of Magic. Marie's goal? Make an item within five years that will appease her teacher. But that's easier said than done.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38j5TByJ0nM
Gathering and collecting alchemy materials, and then synthesizing them into items, is a core part of the story. You can fulfill requests for those in the town, upgrade your atelier, and hire little helpers to assist. On top of this, there are some RPG battles to undertake, potentially leading to encounters with legendary monsters. Turns out magic school is pretty rough.
Atelier Marie Remake is playable with either the story-imposed five-year time limit, or with an "Unlimited Mode" which turns off the time crunch. Either way, Gust's RPG gets a fresh look and a bevy of new platforms to play it on.
Stirring the pot
As the Atelier series grows in popularity, it's cool to see this piece of history get a refresh for modern systems. All the life sim elements may even seem more appealing to players now, who may have put a fair number of hours into games like Stardew Valley and are looking for a new RPG with similar vibes.
In other Atelier news, Atelier Ryza 3: Alchemist of the End & the Secret Key is due out on March 24, 2023 after taking a one-month delay to work on the game. Even with the delay, though, the upcoming spring and summer looks to have plenty for armchair alchemists to dig into.

The Super FX chip was a handsome feather in Nintendo’s cap, even if they very rarely wore it out on the town. A graphics support unit, the Super FX chip was a co-processor that pushed the SNES’ graphic capabilities pretty far. Games like Star Fox and Super Mario World 2: Yoshi’s Island benefitted from the tech and were able to punch above their generational weight class.
Regardless, only Yoshi’s Island doesn’t look entirely antiquated by today’s standards. While 3D graphics were novel at the time, their mostly flat-shaded surfaces came at a tremendous price when it came to framerate. Because of their overall choppiness, games that were classics once can be difficult to play through a modern lens.

Level-5 will hold a live stream presentation next month, offering updates on a selection of titles currently in development at the Japanese studio. The "Level-5 Vision 2023 Tsuzumi" will take place on March 9.
The stream will include new news and details pertaining to upcoming Level-5 releases such as Decapolice, Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road, Megaton Musushi Wired, Fantasy Life I: The Girl Who Steals Time, and the recently revealed Professor Layton and The New World of Steam.
As noted by Gematsu, this live stream announcement is not only the first revelation of a new Megaton Musashi title, along with the debut of a localized title for the Inazuma Eleven release. The live stream will feature English subtitles, which suggests that the studio has global plans for some of its upcoming wares — with the new Professor Layton title being perhaps of the highest interest for puzzle fans.
The Level-5 Vision 2023 Tsuzumi stream will kick off March 9 at 20:00 JST / 03:00 PT / 12:00 BST. We'll be sure to bring you all of the hot gossip from the stream right here on Destructoid, so you don't have to sweat staying up for the wee small hours.

Get ready to fire up those tactical neurons in your brain, as Idea Factory and Compile Heart’s Fairy Fencer F Refrain Chord is set to bring the grid-based combat on April 25.
Fairy Fencer F Refrain Chord is a tactical RPG set in a world where the Goddess and the Vile God have an ongoing feud. Their last encounter resulted in them sealing each other away in the time-out corner. However, they’ve dropped a mess of leftover weapons that are sought by warriors known as Fencers. You join a fencer named Fang and his companions as they set out to find the Furies and resurrect the Goddess.
[embed]https://youtu.be/qUd5UloNCQQ[/embed]
You can expect your usual slate of TRPG mechanics, such as terrain modifiers, buffs, and spells. You can also use your collected Furies to stab the world map (?) to unlock hidden locations and fairies.
I love fairies, but I know absolutely nothing about the Fairy Fencer F series and had to do a bunch of research just to make sure I wasn’t saying something inaccurate when I summarized what it’s all about. Our own CJ Andriesson, on the other hand, gave it a mention as a runner-up to his most anticipated games of the year. Personally, I’m a big fan of CJ’s taste in games, so I take stock in that. Hopefully, he’ll grace us with a review of it, but I’m neither his editor nor his mom, so that’s up to him.
Fairy Fencer F Refrain Chord will be hitting PS4, PS5, and Switch on April 25, 2023.

Capcom has begun location tests for a new virtual reality experience set within the world of its flagship fighting franchise, Street Fighter. The Street Fighter VR: The Shadaloo Enhancement Project is currently available to play in the Capcom store at Hiroshima Plaza in Hiroshima, Japan.
The short experience allows players to step up to the plate against long-time poster boy Ryu and Russian wrestler Zangief in first-person combat, with sound and visuals running on the same engine used for Street Fighter V. The concept sees the player take the role of a lowly Shadaloo grunt, training against two of the World Warriors that they may encounter as the evil organization attempts its takeover of the free world. Yeah... That's exactly who I want to play in VR: A nameless, nobody, Shadaloo trainee.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY3rBDYNXRs&ab_channel=asciijpnews
Utilizing PC VR hardware, players must block attacks and counter with punches and special moves, impacting certain areas on the opponent while their guard is down. A short video not only demonstrates a player throwing out an iconic Hadoken projectile, but also sees the hapless protagonist caught in Zangief's Spinning Pile Driver, which I can only assume is a VR experience likely to demonstrate the technological power of your own stomach.
"Stop playing if you feel sick or feel something is wrong with your body." reads the warning. Indeed.
The demo ends with hints that further characters — such as Akuma and Shadaloo leader Bison himself — will be added to the game in future updates. Capcom has not announced any plans to bring Street Fighter VR: The Shadaloo Enhancement Project to western locations, but I would not be surprised if it at least showed up at one of the booths at the big summer expos such as E3 or Summer Game Fest.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some Pokemon news is on the way
We're getting an update on what's in store for the Pokemon franchise next week. A new Pokemon Presents stream has been scheduled for Feb. 27, airing at 9 a.m. ET / 6 a.m. PT.
The show will stream on the Pokemon YouTube channel starting at 6 a.m. PT, and will run for roughly 20 minutes.
https://twitter.com/Pokemon/status/1628032454295531522
The stream will spotlight "about 20 minutes of exciting Pokemon news," as part of the Pokemon Day 2023 celebration.
Gotta catch 'em all
Speculation on what could be in this Pokemon Presents is easy to center on the most recent entry, Pokemon Scarlet and Violet. Any potential DLC for the latest Pokemon generation would be interesting to see, and there are a lot of places the series could go after the events and ending of Scarlet and Violet.
A hint of what's ahead could be interesting, though the Pokemon team has been hard at work tuning up Scarlet and Violet after it launched with a number of technical issues.
Still, there are many other places The Pokemon Company could go for additional announcements and reveals. A new spin-off or follow-up to a cult-classic is always a welcome surprise, especially with some of the recent ones the company has put together. Is it too much to hope for Pokemon Conquest to make a comeback?
Add in potential updates to live-service titles like Pokemon Unite, and there's a lot the stream could hold for February 27. No matter what, I'm interested to see what the future holds for Pokemon. Last year was very Poke-heavy, as we got two big entries in the series. And with next week's stream, we might get to see what the road looks like beyond the launch of Scarlet and Violet.
Tune in for the stream on February 27 at 9 a.m. ET / 6 a.m. PT on the Pokemon YouTube channel here.

A new State of Play is on the way, spotlighting upcoming games for Sony's consoles. The PlayStation State of Play airs on Feb. 23 at 4 p.m. ET / 1 p.m. PT.
The focus for this stream looks to be third-party titles. Sony will kick things off with some looks at "anticipated" games from its third-party partners, including indies. Five new PlayStation VR2 titles are also due to be announced.
Then, we'll get over 15 minutes of new gameplay details and updates on Rocksteady's upcoming Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. No estimated runtime was given, though it sounds at least somewhat lengthy from the amount of Suicide Squad alone.

The year ahead for PlayStation
This PlayStation State of Play is the first of the year for Sony, and looks set to spotlight what's on the way for its hardware, both in the PlayStation 5 and the imminent PlayStation VR2.
We've already seen 2023 kick-off streams from both Xbox and Nintendo. So with this stream, Sony is taking the opportunity to set the tone for its year ahead.
With that in mind, the lack of first-party games here does feel a bit surprising. We don't really know what Sony's first-party lineup looks like for 2023, outside an assumption that Marvel's Spider-Man 2 will play a part in it.
Still, Sony State of Play streams have had some surprises before, and the third-party developers could bring some surprises. There are other games we've yet to hear more about due out later this year, including Street Fighter 6 and Final Fantasy XVI, both of which have featured in Sony's previous streams.
PlayStation VR2 is also front-of-mind for Sony, it seems. With five games, that will make up at least a decent chunk of the stream, and probably be exciting for anyone picking up the new headset this week. We'll see what all Sony has in store for its PlayStation State of Play on Feb. 23.

The first time I encountered "VR" was at a county fair in the '90s. It was for a racing game demo, and basically amounted to putting a TV on your head...I think I lost some of my eyesight that day. It was an absolutely fascinating experience all the same, and I've kept my eye on the tech ever since.
Once the first consumer-grade Oculus Rift headset launched, I was there, and saw all of the advancements of the subsequent two decades since the TV-helmet at once: but there was so much more work to do. For the past seven years or so, VR has struggled to balance power and comfort. The Oculus Quest 2 is comfortable, but not super powerful. Other headsets focus on power at the expense of clunk, like multiple finnicky tracking devices. The PlaySt…]]></summary>

It almost doesn't sound right saying that out loud: "a new Professor Layton game". Not a remaster. Not a rerelease. Something new. So new, in fact, that the team at Level-5 has even stuck it in the title: Professor Layton and the New World of Steam.
What do we know about the game at the moment? Well, not a lot if we're being honest.

After more than half a decade in development, Atomic Heart has arrived as the first title from developer Mundfish. This BioShock-inspired shooter is an impressive debut in many ways, and it wears its influences on its sleeve – for better and worse. The game’s dazzling world design, extraordinary production values, and fast-paced fights make for a solid campaign, but the derivative plot and often painful writing insist on dragging it down.
Atomic Heart’s premise is one of its most intriguing elements. The game t…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Time is flying by a little too fast in 2023, although it’s not all bad news as a new month means new Game Pass additions. Microsoft have announced the next four games hitting the service before March 3rd, alongside Atomic Heart which releases today. I was interested in the steely Soviet shooter until I read James’ review and saw that the protagonist yells “Crispy critters,” more than once - I think I’ll skip.


Here are the next batch of Game Pass titles:

Merge & Blade (Feb 28th)
Soul Hackers 2 (Feb 28th)
F1 22 (March 2nd)
Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty (March 3rd)

This is my first time hearing of Merge & Blade, not to be confused with Mount & Blade which is also on Game Pass. Merge & Blade is a hybrid between puzzle games and auto-battlers. Rounds will start with a Tetris-like mini-game, but instead of shapes, you’re guiding different unit types and merging them together. You then use your completed party to raid castles and kill monsters. Mixing - or merging - Tetris into a new genre is a recipe for success, so I’ll definitely be downloading this one.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pokémon Presents returns Monday, February 27, with 20 minutes of Pokémon news celebrating Pokémon Day 2023. 
The official Pokémon Twitter account announced this today, with a short 15-second video hyping up the presentation. There's not too much to glean from the video, but it does feature the main theme from Pokémon Red and Blue. Since the reveal earlier this month that Game Boy and Game Boy Advance games are playable on Switch via Nintendo Switch Online, fans have speculated that older Pokémon games like Red, Blue, Yellow, Gold, Silver, Crystal, and even Ruby, Sapphire, and Emerald could appear on the service one day. Perhaps that's an announcement we'll be getting this Sunday. 
The next #PokemonPresents is on the way, Trainers! 🤩
#PokemonDay 2023! 🎉

February 21, 2023
With the presentation lasting 20 minutes, there's plenty of time for an announcement like that and more. And in recent years, the Pokémon Day direct-style presentation has been quite stellar. Last year during the Pokémon Day stream, Pokémon Scarlet and Violet were announced alongside a big Pokémon Legends: Arceus update, a Pokémon Brillaint Diamond and Shining Pearl mystery gift (Shaymin), the Alola update for Pokémon GO, and other announcements for games like Pokémon Unite, Pokémon Masters EX, and Pokémon Cafe Remix. The Pokémon Company event announced a new online anime, too. 
Only time will tell if this year's Presents features as many exciting announcements. Fortunately, we don't have to wait long because Pokémon Day is Monday, February 27. The Pokémon Presents begins at 6 a.m. PT/9 a.m. ET and will run about 20 minutes. 
In the meantime, read Game Informer's Pokémon Scarlet and Violet review and then read our review of Pokémon Legends: Arceus.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft has signed a binding 10-year legal agreement with Nintendo to bring Call of Duty to Nintendo players, presuming the company's colossal $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard is approved. 
Since the acquisition announcement last year, Microsoft has been attempting to prove to government agencies like the U.S.' Federal Trade Commission that this acquisition does not fall into any monopolistic activity and would not harm competitors like PlayStation. However, Microsoft has had a bit of a rough go at it. To counter, though, the company has been proactive in attempting to get the greenlight from the FTC, going as far as promising PlayStation that Call of Duty games will continue to come to Sony's consoles and agreeing to bring Call of Duty to Nintendo hardware. 
Now, Microsoft president and vice chair Brad Smith has announced on Twitter that Microsoft has formally signed a legally binding 10-year agreement with Nintendo to bring Call of Duty games to Nintendo players. Here's the statement Smith released on behalf of Microsoft, in full: 
We’ve now signed a binding 10-year contract to bring Xbox games to Nintendo’s gamers. This is just part of our commitment to bring Xbox games and Activision titles like Call of Duty to more players on more platforms. pic.twitter.com/JmO0hzw1BO
February 21, 2023
Many have already begun to speculate how Activision Blizzard will bring Call of Duty games to Nintendo consoles, which are traditionally much less powerful than current-gen Xbox and PlayStation consoles, with "full feature and content parity." 
If I had to guess, Call of Duty will likely go the route of cloud gaming seen on the Switch, unless Nintendo's next console is set to be a significantly more powerful piece of hardware. Only time will tell. 
In the meantime, read Game Informer's thoughts on the latest Call of Duty in our Modern Warfare II review.

Metroid Prime has long been considered one of the crowning achievements of Nintendo’s GameCube library. The series’ seamless transition to the first-person genre was defined by its frenetic action, massively explorable environments, clever puzzles, and daunting boss encounters. However, the subsequent two decades have worn on the original release, but much like Samus by the end of each game, Metroid Prime Remastered brings the title back to full power.
Metroid Prime Remastered takes the already-stellar original title and gives it a shiny coat of paint. While not uniqu…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After the mud and forests of Normandy, and the grim, snowy climes of the Eastern Front, Company Of Heroes 3 feels like World War II on its summer holiday. With two campaigns spanning each side of the sunny Mediterranean, this is arguably Relic's breeziest and most colourful theatre of war yet, evoking the same kind of swagger and gung ho optimism as a Hollywood action flick. It's a feeling that might seem out of place given the current climate, especially now, just days away from the first anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. But while your main objective is always one of domination, gradually turning the map from red to blue on both a micro and macro scale, this is ultimately a game about searing comebacks - of beating back seemingly impossible aggressors, and finding hope where previously there was only despair. I think we could all do with a bit of that in this day and age, even if the battles before you end up feeling like nothing more than the digital equivalent of plonking down a big box of toy soldiers on your living room floor and going daka-daka-daka as they all fall over.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Solo dev Madison Karrh’s point-and-click puzzler Birth really caught me off-guard. From the look of the screenshots, I was expecting a creepy story in the vein of Little Misfortune or Fran Bow, but instead Birth is infinitely more introspective. Sure, it’s a game about death, decay, and loneliness, but it’s told in the most gentle and genuine way possible. Its themes are heavy, but the game could not be more light-hearted. I have no idea how it does it, but Birth is weirdly the most wholesome yet creepy game I've ever played.

At the time it was hard to gauge if the game was a sequel, a pseudo-remake, or something in between. We now have a clearer view of what it really is ahead of its release this June, and it’s also (confusingly) changed its name back to Layers Of Fear, singular. Check out the new trailer below:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The release of the Pinocchio-inspired Soulslike Lies of P has been narrowed down to this August. A new story trailer introduces a seemingly villainous character, Simon, while highlighting some of the dangerous monstrosities waiting to dismantle players. 
Lies of P unfolds in the fictional, Belle Époque-era French city of Krat as players control Pinocchio, a mechanoid puppet on a quest to become human. A certain Mr. Geppetto might be able to help with that, but Krat has been overtaken by sinister creatures Pinocchio must cut down using his multi-purpose mechanical arm. 


The gameplay takes heavy cues from From Software’s work – Bloodborne in particular – as players take down enemies with deliberate sword attacks, while various mechanical arms grant abilities like firing lightning bolts or a grappling hook to reel in targets. Outside of battles, sidequests present the option of lying to characters, and the truthfulness of your answers alters the direction of these stories. 
Lies of P will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S (including Game Pass), and PC. You can learn more by reading our hands-on preview from last year’s Gamescom.]]></summary>

Tomorrow, And Tomorrow, And Tomorrow is a book about the decades-long relationship between two people who are game developers. And like the above, it would be impossible to explain to someone who doesn't work in the games industry why a small exchange between the two of them made me absolutely roar with laughter.

From an Nvidia tech demo back to in 2019 to an RTX-branded trailer released just last month, this souped-up lighting and reflection tech has been a key piston in propelling the Soviet sci-fi FPS’ hype train. Some slightly awkward news, then: the PC version won’t support ray tracing at launch.
I noticed the lack of ray tracing options in the review build we received last week, and got in touch with the game's press relations team to check if I was missing something, or if they were due to be added via update. The response confirmed that their absence was not an error, and that "the devs will be looking into implementing this post-launch." Well then!

Come and have a gander at its spaceship antics - or, if you're like me, just watch the two full seconds of a crew member giving Ham the pig a nice big belly-rub on repeat.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you’re British and you’re old, then you love the ZX Spectrum. (Or the Commodore 64, I suppose, but not both. Never both.) Personally, I’m what they called a “Speccy” kid, and I have carried a deep and profound love of the elderly microcomputer’s cassette tape screeches, colour clash and long, long load times into my adult life, despite the fact that – and please don’t get upset, purists – many of the great Spectrum games don’t hold up in the cold light of the modern day. It’s not that the games are necessarily bad, more that they were tremendous for their time. Still eminently enjoyable, but they require the player to get their head into a certain zone, to put up with what are inarguably quite archaic controls and mechanics. 


Oddly enough, there are some Spectrum games on Steam, thanks to a publisher called Pixel Games. However, with the utmost respect to their output… these are not the kind of games that are going to foster interest in the Speccy amongst modern players. Of course, that may well not be the point, but I’d be a little taken aback if even avowed old-school gamers were going to bother picking up the likes of gardening simulator Pedro, a game that scored 63% in Newsfield’s iconic Crash magazine back in the day, or Sam Stoat: Safebreaker, which did a little better at 68%.

Akka Arrh is a reimagined version of a prototype Atari arcade machine from the ‘80s. Originally scrapped due to a lack of interest, the trailer for the re-release claims that only three cabinets have ever been seen. 40 years later, when Atari reached out to veteran designer Jeff Minter (Tempest 2000, Polybius) to remake one of its games, he chose Akka Arrh. The result is a reimagining of the original concept, fused with Minter’s signature psychedelic visuals and some modern-day improvements. While the game can…]]></summary>

It’s a fascinatingly chaotic medley of ideas, and a rare FPS that lacks even the slightest whiff of battle pass-peddling live serfdom, but those ideas so often fail to gel that it can feel like a game made by several different dev teams. For a shooter set within an alternate history Soviet Union, it could perhaps have used some more central planning.

They all force a little chuckle out of me, but none of them have made me belly laugh like I Am Jesus Christ, a first-person retelling of Christ’s tale from birth, to death, to rebirth.  


I Am Jesus Christ’s genre is slightly murky, although, it almost looks like a giant Skyrim mod complete with unfeeling NPCs, first-person spellcasting, and an open world full of quest markers. The newest trailer shows some of Christ’s cool abilities like walking on water, shooting light beams at Satan, and fishing - which is incidentally what I’m looking forward to the most. 


In fairness, the Christ sim looks like a pretty robust and thorough retelling of his journey, depicting scenes like the Last Supper, only this time all the disciples have exclamation marks above their heads. The Steam page also details 30 different miracles (or spells) and a number of different areas to explore.

        <updated>2023-02-20T11:33:27.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Like all good fairytale characters, Pinocchio gets a revision every couple of years - except for 2022, when he was adapted thrice (mostly in bad films, except for the Del Toro one). The loveable puppet isn’t waiting too long for his next comeback, as the RPG Soulslike Lies Of P is coming to PC and Game Pass in August. 


Lies Of P’s newest trailer is mostly a black screen with a lot of VO, but we get a clear look at Pinocchio's daddy Master Gepetto this time. The trailer follows a blob wobbling through very Victorian streets before it slides into some automation and uses the machine’s body as a puppet. The result is a boss-sized monstrosity that sits halfway between Lovecraftian horror and industrial defect. It also reminds me of Gears 5’s weird infected robots, with tentacles and slime hanging off their metallic arms - equally gross and cool.


The newest trailer doesn’t show off any Bloodborne-style combat, but we’ve had plenty of looks at that already, including a fight with a gorilla robocop. This Soulslike looks just as aggressive as you’d expect, emphasising quick dodge rolls and last-minute, anxiety-fueled parries. Pinocchio’s arm doubles up as a grappling hook to pull enemies in, which is always cool in a hack n’ slasher, and makes even more sense when you’re playing as a puppet. Also, is it just me or is Pinocchio pretty this time around?

For those who wish to try something new, the developers of Dyschronia: Chronos Alternate at MyDearest want to help you with a chance to win your choice of a PlayStation 5 Digital Edition, a Nintendo Switch OLED, or a Meta Quest 2 (128 GB).
Dyschronia: Chronos Alternate takes place in the city of Astrum Close where the crime rate is only 0.001%. Protagonist Hal Scion is a young investigator who possesses a special ability called “Memory Dive” that allows him to see into and alter the past and he uses this ability to collect evidence for investigations. When the founder of Astrum Close is found dead, Hal must take up the case in order to solve this theoretically “impossible” murder. The game is currently available on the Meta Quest 2, is launching on PlayStation VR2 on February 22nd, and launches on Nintendo Switch later this year.
One lucky winner can choose between a PlayStation 5 Digital Edition, a Nintendo Switch OLED, or a Meta Quest 2 (128 GB) to jumpstart their journey into the cyber-noir anime world of Dyschronia: Chronos Alternate.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On this week's episode of the Ultimate Audio Bang, we get an update on Hayden's knees and the various ways in which he's attempting to save them. We also take a gander at fantasy FPS Dark And Darker, Steam's most wishlisted 'shooter'. I'm less keen on it than Hayden is.
 In the second part of the pod, we talk about the goals we've achieved in theHunter: Call Of The Wild, including a tale about moose and a deer that knocked me out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Quickplay strategy games have always been a thing, but they appear to be gaining in popularity lately. I will probably regret not keeping Ozymandias aside for the traditional "summer strategy game for when your brain is a gas" bit, but the scene is looking healthy enough to chance it.
You know that cliché feeling of "just one more turn"? Ozymandias is a bronze age 4X that builds momentum enough to turn that into "just one more game". It is incredibly easy to learn, and despite looking a little dry and number heavy, becomes more effortless, more pleasant the longer you play. It also becomes more clear how much depth there is hidden away in such a light design. It's about proving yourself the most prestigious civilisation, not through total conquest, but by exploiting the lay of the land, and leaning into your strengths.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I like wizards because they're the dramatic combination of powerful, cocky, and a bit dim. Through some quirk of bloodline or destiny, wizards can access impossible forces simply by saying magic words. This does not engender caution. A wizard's not a real wizard until they have accidentally set themselves on fire or unleashed an ancient evil. And if you throw four of this dim demigods together? Well, you get the co-op wizard action of the Magicka games, where freestyling elemental combinations can (and often will) lead you to heal a boss or torch your pal's face. Splendid chaos.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jake Solomon, the director of Marvel’s Midnight Suns and the modern XCOM games, has announced his departure from Firaxis. 
Solomon has worked at Firaxis for 23 years and is best known as the lead designer of XCOM: Enemy Unknown and the director of XCOM 2, including its War of the Chosen expansion. He most recently directed Marvel’s Midnight Suns. 
In a statement posted to Twitter, Solomon doesn’t state a specific reason for his resignation but does tease his next project by stating, “My brain is on fire with a new dream. Time to go chase it.” Whether or not this dream keeps him in the game industry is a mystery for now. You can read his full statement below.
Some of our favorite memories of Jake’s time at Firaxis include this funny video of him visiting a game store to convince shoppers to buy XCOM 1. He was also a great sport on our Marvel’s Midnight Suns Rapid-Fire interview. You can read our review of his final project at Firaxis, Marvel's Midnight Suns, here.]]></summary>

Late last year, turn-based indie RPG The Outbound Ghost was delisted from Steam after a statement from lead dev Conrad Grindheim claimed his relationship with publisher Digerati had “dissolved.” Soon after, Digerati filed a lawsuit against developer Conradical over a breach of contract and “several false defamatory” statements. When reporting on the original news, CJ thought the messy situation could get messier, and he was right. Grindheim has now DMCA’d his own game on console storefronts and accused Digerati of withholding royalties.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am legendary ronin Sakomoto Ryoma. I shout "yosh!" as I harvest six (6) gleaming radishes from my allotment. I shoot a bandit in the head with a revolver. I send my adoptive daughter to trade some homemade pickles. I partake in a brooding chat, then stamp on a dude's head. I help a recluse regain his confidence. I have totally forgotten what I was meant to be doing.
Like A Dragon: Ishin feels like a step backward, but in a brilliant way. Kiryu and co. may have moved onto a turn-based future, yet Sakomoto Ryoma and his pals have turned back the clock to an Edo period of brawlin' and chicken betting that's most reminiscent of Yakuza 0, only it's not the roaring 80s but the bloody 1800s. There's nothing here that will convert those who aren't keen on the series, but if you're an ardent fan or a newcomer eager to experience its wild swings between serious and silly, Ishin is an excellent place to start.

Like a Dragon: Ishin is not a new game. It's a remake of an old game – 2014's Ryu Ga Gotoku: Ishin, released only in Japan on the PS3 and PS4. And yet, despite the age of its skeleton, in some ways, the game stands out as one of the more impressive games in developer Ryu Ga Gotoku's (RGG) portfolio – even with a few noticeable weak points. 
Ishin takes place in the 1860s, at the end of Japan's Edo period. You play as Sakamoto Ryoma – a real-life historical figure – who, amid his own revenge scheme, finds himself embroiled in the …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tetris is a new original film coming to Apple TV+, the iPhone maker's streaming service, and if the first trailer for it is any indication, it looks like a great time. 
Released yesterday, Tetris begins with the classic Europe song, "The Final Countdown," which then aptly transitions to Korobeiniki, the main theme of Tetris (you know the one). The trailer then showcases how Taron Egerton's character is deadset on bringing Tetris to everybody after playing it once. Unable to get falling tetrominos out of his head, Egerton's character heads to the Soviet Union to convince the game's creator that he can make him a millionaire. 
Check it out for yourself in the Apple TV+ Tetris trailer below: 


As you can see, Tetris looks great – funny, suspenseful, dramatic, and a seemingly great retelling of how the "greatest game ever made" made its way to our hands via the NES and Game Boy. 
Tetris is directed by Jon S. Baird and written by Noah Pink. It begins streaming on Apple TV+ on March 31. 
Are you going to check Tetris out next month? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

I'd say building a romantic connection with a wrestler entirely formed of green ooze, or training your M.E.A.T. at Mrs. Muscles gym counts as magic – pure magic, even. And that's what Wrestling With Emotions: New Kid On The Block offers. It's a wrestling dating sim with a splash of RPG, and almost certainly a game that'll pin your heart in a bear hug and never let go.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You know that famous saying about those who forget the past are forever doomed to make the same mistakes? That's Octopath Traveler 2 in a nutshell, a JRPG that follows so precisely in the footsteps of its predecessor that you'd be forgiven for thinking it was suddenly 2019 again and that the last few pandemic years were nothing but a terrible existential nightmare. But alas, here we are in 2023 with another Octopath Traveler game that is, bar a couple of very light tweaks and additions, exactly the same game as what came before it, for better and for worse.

In an age where remakes and retro-inspired projects try recreating what classic games of old felt like, Octopath Traveler II accomplishes something impressive. Despite being rooted in modern design with a host of conveniences, it effortlessly captures the spirit, style, and sense of adventure of the best RPGs from the SNES era, while still innovating and showing there’s life in turn-based battles yet. The feat is even more remarkable, considering Octopath II’s most significant changes are small and subtle.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier today we looked at the most affordable PCIe 4.0 SSD, with the Solidigm P41 Plus 2TB at $99.99, and now it's time to look at one of the very fastest PCIe 4.0 SSDs, the WD SN850x. It's down to $99.99 for a 1TB model and $159.99 for a 2TB size, a new low price for each capacity and a great deal for our top PCIe 4.0 SSD recommendation. 
This SSD is only really rivalled by the more expensive Samsung 990 Pro, our overall 'fastest SSD' recipient, with both options offering random write performance well over 1M IOPS and sequential read speeds of up to 7300MB/s, at the very limit of the PCIe 4.0 standard.

That's a heavy reduction from its original $169.99 price point, and an awesome value for a drive that works well in PCs and even PS5s.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Marvel’s Midnight Suns gets its second story expansion next week in the form of the aptly titled “Redemption.” It stars Venom, looking to right the wrongs he’s committed, but he’s going to have to overcome the powerful demon Mephisto to do it. 
The trailer shows Eddie Brock, having recovered from the events of the main campaign, making a deal with Mephisto to help rid himself of his darkness. Naturally, this goes about as well as you would expect, leading to Venom joining the Midnight Suns as a playable character to battle this formidable demonic threat. 


Redemption will be available on February 23. It comes included with the game's season pass. Firaxis' role-playing strategy take on the Marvel universe has already received DLC in the form of a Deadpool character and mission pack. Despite the game receiving positive reviews (including cracking Game Informer’s Top 10 Games of 2022), it was recently revealed to have underperformed in sales.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hot diggedy daffodil, am I glad I picked Casual difficulty in Veil Of Dust. Unlike some games, Veil Of Dust doesn't make it sound like any sort of concession; the middle difficulty is called Challenge, and says "it's pretty tough - you've been warned". I took the warning seriously, and thank God, because even the easiest difficulty had me pouring dandelion tea down my brother's throat like he was doing a kegstand (and in the game).
Áine and Shane are a pair of Irish siblings who've moved to Oregon to start a new life, which, in the main story, involves eating potatoes and trying not to get depressed. It's difficult enough that I didn't think I would like it at first, as even basic tasks deplete your stamina and sleeping in your 1860s hovel with a hole in the roof doesn't restore very much per night. Áine can do spells, but they're simple and only really take the edge off what is a very hard life. Magic isn't a cure-all in Veil Of Dust, and using it has to be weighed up, just like everything else.

In the... uh, semi-heady fog of 2019 came the news that it was getting a remake, and I was muchly excited, for in the interim I'd actually learned the original existed and how good and somehow unrivalled it still was. And finally, in the slight damp of late 2022, that remake arrived. It is a remarkably faithful remake, to a degree I may not ever have seen for such an old game. Some details and flourishes aside, it's basically the same design, with all the same parts.

Coincidentally, I've also finally got into Total Warhammer lately, and spent some time reacquainting myself with Warlords Battlecry, and in between building city walls and crushing stupid aryan elfs, I've realised what truly connects all three: balance. They all, correctly, reject it.

As horrific as the game looks, it's the soundtrack and creepy sound effects that do much of the heavy lifting in building fear and tension. To understand how the remake remixes and enhances the original game's soundscape, I picked the brains of RE4 sound director Hiroshi Tamura and lead composer Kota Suzuki to learn how they're making the game sound as good as it plays. 
Game Informer: A goal for the Resident Evil 4 remake is to create more believable soundscapes. Can you discuss what that means, with examples, and why that's important to the team?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[American McGee is still trying to turn his theoretical Alice: Asylum into a reality. The last game in his dark action-platformer series, Alice: Madness Returns, released more than ten years ago, and since then McGee has been funding development through a Patreon which, at the time of writing, currently has 3,192 paying members. In 2021, McGee released the first draft of a script, and now he’s back with a 414-page design bible, the announcement of a partner studio, and an odd plea to EA.

So while other outlets will be delivering their final verdicts on Omega Force’s beast batterin’ simulator today, I’m afraid I haven’t had the chance to play enough of it to give it a fair shakedown yet. It’s good, though! I really like it, and as a huge Monster Hunter fan I’m pleased that there’s finally a worthy alternative to Capcom’s long-running series. Competition is good!

Wild Hearts may seem similar to Monster Hunter and other hunting genre games, but its focus on constructing gadgets in a world steeped in Japanese folklore and feudal-era Japan help it carve its own identity. Like Monster Hunter, you track big game, craft new armor and weapons, and do it all over again. But the otherworldly take on old-world Japan, filled with giant mythical beasts, is a profo…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s the dead of night. I’m in my little tugboat out on open waters. I can barely see three feet in front of my nose because of the thick blanket of fog, but I'm trying my hand at night fishing, hoping to hook something really good. I find a squid spot and start to fish, reeling in one or two fine-looking catches. The third one, however, is monstrous, a mess of jagged teeth and sickly pale flesh. Yes, this should make for a fine amount of cash. The more morbid it is, the more money I get. Suddenly there’s a deep rumbling in the ocean and panic starts to creep in. I chuck my prize into my cargo and speed back to town, the phrase ‘fuck round, find out’ circling my brain.
I’ve not been playing Dredge long, but I’m calling it one of my favourite games of the year, right now, in February. Black Salt Games' sinister fishing RPG is gripping and enchanting in a way I didn’t anticipate. I’ve spent hours exploring its murky waters and my constant shock at what unsettling creatures my hook brings in is seemingly never-ending. Its eldritch world keeps pulling me back with its mystery and malevolent horror, and its sense of atmosphere and tension is incredible. Basically, I'm completely enraptured, hook, line, sinker. Dredge already feels like one of this year’s greatest indie horrors and all this, from a fishing game of all things.

The original PlayStation VR, from the outside at least, seemed like a moderate success for Sony. It was a functional VR alternative for players who were not interested in entering the world of PC gaming and it had at least one undeniable, exclusive hit with Astro Bot Rescue Mission.
PlayStation VR2 is the next logical step for the sub-platform. It works with Sony’s latest hardware, it improves on basically every aspect of PlayStation VR, but it’s not quite the virtual reality revolution I feel like we’ve been waiting for since the advent of the medium.

Call of the Mountain is meant to be PlayStation VR2’s showcase piece, and in some important ways, it functions as exactly that. Firing off an arrow with a bow in VR feels great, and getting a chance to see the world of Horizon from a novel perspective can be exhilarating. The primary gameplay of Call of the Mountain, however, struggles to find fun at a basic level which ultimately sours the larger experience.
Call of the Mountain features a perfunctory cameo from Aloy to remind you that you are in her world, but this gam…]]></summary>

I’ve put together this settings guide – based on the game’s early trial build – for those who want to join the hunt pronto, but above all else my advice is to wait until developers Omega Force get the promised performance improvements up and running. From what I’ve played, Wild Hearts’s bad shape is doing an otherwise enjoyable Monster Hunter-like a huge disservice.

It normally retails for $75.99, but you can tick a 50% off coupon on the product page and use code 2YXE4T73 to knock the price down to just $22.79 - an incredibly low asking price for a solid budget option that can handle even ultrawide monitors up to 26.4lbs/12kg.

What may surprise you, however, is how deep these historical details run throughout Pentinment’s DNA, right down the game’s text fonts. Obsidian design director Josh Sawyer told me all about how the team revived long-dead historical fonts, to give them a new life in a modern format.

I enjoyed the spirited discussion over which throwing knives are good and which are bad.

This week, I suppose our choices are both about architecture, but in very different ways. What's better: funicular fights or elaborate corridor architecture?

Running a school though? That's a challenge I don't mind taking on. Twopoint Campus does a great plate-spinning take on a school admin sim, but if you want something with cards, a dark lord, and the option for organic school meals, then... well, then you're making a very specific request. But it's one I can fulfil with Spellcaster University. And it's bloody difficult.

Like previous Playstation port Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered, it’s not the most easygoing game either, but I’ve cycled through my share of deaths and rebirths and can report that Returnal will make do with older graphics cards and middling RAM counts. It’s a mostly well-considered porting job too, with optional ray tracing, various upscaling tools, ultrawide support for 21:9 and 32:9 monitors, and pages upon pages of customisable display and control settings.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The last thing you need when you’ve just crash-landed on an unknown planet teeming with predatory wildlife is to discover you’re also stuck in a time loop. But that’s the fate of deep-space astronaut Selene in Returnal, when she ditches her single-seater vessel on a remote rock called Atropos. Each time she falls foul of the local fauna, she pops back into existence right next to her broken ship, with no obvious means of escape. Forget Aliens vs Predator, this is Aliens vs Groundhog Day.
But what a day it is, as Returnal combines a best-in-class third-person shooter with a deep dive into the psychology of its protagonist. Selene’s journey into Atropos, through a thick jungle, a burning vermilion desert and beyond, sends her circling through a smorgasbord of emotions – from confusion to hope, despair to determination. And so often, her mood dovetails with your own highs and lows of elation and frustration, until every part of Returnal encases you in its loop.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Riot Games released a promotional video this morning revealing its plans to release three League of Legends spin-off games this year. Two of these titles, Song of Nunu and Convergence, had been previously announced, while the third game, The Mageseeker, makes it debut. 


The Mageseeker is set to arrive first sometime this spring. Developed by Digital Sun, the team behind Moonlighter, it’s described as a gritty 2D action RPG. It stars Sylas and takes place in Demacia. You can find The Mageseeker on PC and unspecified consoles. 
Convergence launches this summer and was first revealed at The Game Awards in 2019. Starring Ekko, it’s a 2D action-platforming adventure by Double Stallion that features parkour and time-manipulation mechanics. Convergence launches for PlayStation and Xbox consoles, Switch, and PC via Steam and Epic. 
Song of Nunu closes out the year. Releasing this fall, it centers on the young Nunu and his yeti partner Willump on a search to find Nunu’s mother. The charming adventure game focuses on the pair working together to solve environmental puzzles. Song of Nunu comes from the folks at Tequila Works, the developer of titles such as Rime and Gylt, and it will be available on PlayStation and Xbox consoles, Switch, and PC via Steam and Epic. 
Riot released its first League of Legends spin-off Ruined King in 2021 to generally positive reviews, so we're curious to see how these other projects fair and if they'll attract new, non-MOBA fans coming off Netflix's well-received Arcane series. Which League of Legends title are you most interested in?

Through The Nightmares may not be about spellcasting and amateur alchemy, but it still draws upon the arcane and otherworldly, setting its deviously difficult action-platforming inside the sleepscapes of frightened children.
You are the Sandman, and you are neither sprinkling happy dust on Danish eyelids nor delivering Liberace-haired boyfriends to vocal quartets. Instead, you’re an active fighter of nightmares, diving into the brains of restless kids to explore their most traumatic memories and, ultimately, defeat the monstrous embodiments of their fears.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Loathe as I am to become one of those "want to feel old?" types of posters, this review requires me to point out that the original Pharaoh came out in 1999, almost 25 years ago. It was one of that era's City Building series that included Zeus and all of the Caesars, a run of games so good that they earned the capital letters. Pharaoh also happens to be one of my foundational video games, and I played it when I was knee-high to my big brother's desk, at a time when family homes had one (1) yellow-grey computer with a CRT screen. And now it's back, baby.
Pharaoh: A New Era means I can play that game of my childhood on my shiny black RGB-lit bastard. Honestly though, the "A New Era" part is a bit much. Sure, the updated graphics are fabulous and the quality of life changes mean it plays like smooth peanut butter to the 90s' extra crunchy. It's a good remake of a solid game, but the mummy in the casket is fundamentally the same.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I kind of hate mechanical hard drives these days. Yes, they're cheap per gigabyte, yes they're fairly reliable, yes they're absolutely the way to go if you need to store a lot of data and don't care how long it takes to access it. But. But. These drives are hard to go back to after you're used to SSDs, with their near-instant access times, completely silent operation, resistance to shocks, drops and magnets and of course their overall SPEED. 
So when I had the chance, I bought the biggest SSD I could afford, a 4TB model at the time, and copied literally every bit of data from the four or five 1TB or smaller hard drives that I'd bought over the years and stuck into my increasingly full PC tower. It was expensive, and it took ages to copy everything across, but as soon as I turned my computer on for the first time and I didn't have to listen to the clicks and whirs of a mechanical drive, I was completely convinced I'd made the right call to ditch spinning rust.

It's three-minutes-long, has no music, and simply lets you revel in the "satisfaction in reclamation".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: if there’s a cute animal game that looks like it’s going to make me cry, then sign me up, I’m ready to go. In fairness, though, co-op adventure Blanc looks like it's going to be a lot lighter than games like Endling: Extinction is Forever and the notoriously upsetting Shelter series at first glance, but I’ve learned to never let my guard down around these kinds of games. Those cute art styles are almost always a front for a brutal sneak attack on your emotions.
Blanc is very much aiming for your heartstrings with its adorable animal duo and picturesque snowy landscapes. The first half teases massive potential for a cutesy story with fun puzzle antics, but the game is majorly let down by a repetitive and often frustrating second half and lacklustre ending. After the promise of a warm, cosy adventure, I watched the end credits roll and couldn't help feeling like I'd been left out in the cold.

The first-person archaeology game was put on hold in 2019 after Valve acquired Campo Santo and had them support other Valve projects like Half-Life: Alyx. Now Campo's in-limbo game has a December 2029 listing on Steam, which almost certainly means nothing, but it’s fun to dust off some memories.

The big surprise this season is the Valentine’s themed Loverwatch, a non-canon text adventure that allows you to court either Mercy or Genji. Naturally, I chose to date Genji (described as Overwatch’s “bad boy”), and the results were surprising. It’s cringe-y and occasionally grating, but it’s also surprisingly charming and stuffed with referential humour that OW fans will surely love.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Illumination has taken its promotion of The Super Mario Bros. Movie to the next level by launching a website and commercial promoting the brothers’ New York City plumbing business, and it's actually pretty cool. 
You can visit the website here, which features a commercial promoting the Mario Bros. business. Older fans will likely recognize the catchy jingle as the theme song of the 1989 Super Mario Brothers Super Show, which is a nice homage. 


The website also features humorous testimonials, job opportunities, and even a working phone number. Calling this number (929-55-MARIO) plays a recorded message by the Charlie Day-voiced Luigi, which provides a nice sample of his performance as the green-clad sidekick. Texting the number returns a message, which, depending on when you sent it, may return a digital poster for the movie. GI editor Kyle Hilliard got this Toad poster when he texted the number yesterday:
In my case, I only got a message thanking me for my interest in Super Mario Bros. Plumbing with a link to a form submission on the website. I'm not sure what you get for submitting this form, but feel free to find out yourselves. 
The Super Mario Bros. Movie premieres in theaters on April 7. You can check out the official movie poster here. Watch the latest trailer featuring Donkey Kong and Cat Suit Mario here.]]></summary>

The news came in an announcement tweet declaring the game has gone gold, meaning it's essentially complete and ready to be printed on discs. Dead Island 2 had previously been scheduled to launch on February 3 before it was delayed to April 28. Speaking of April 28, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor was recently pushed to that same day. It wouldn't be surprising if Dambuster moved its launch forward to steer clear of Star Wars' blast radius. 
You asked for it, you got it. Dead Island 2 went gold and it's coming out a week early.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[2 Player Productions, the film crew behind the acclaimed Double Fine Adventure! series chronicling the making of Double Fine Productions’ Broken Age, has suddenly released a new documentary series following the development of Psychonauts 2. Best of all, you can watch every episode right now. 
The series, called PsychOdyssey, consists of a whopping 32 episodes, all of which are available to watch for free on Double Fine’s YouTube channel. Double Fine Adventure! earned praise for its raw, intimate look at the good, bad, and ugly sides of game development as the crew spent years filming in Double Fine's studio as Broken Age came together. Psychonauts 2's tumultous road to release, from crowdfunding campaigns to Microsoft's acquistion of Double Fine, makes its creation a fascinating subject, and we're excited to see how 2 Player Productions captured it.

Capturing the essence of an established fiction is tricky business, especially when translating into a new medium. It’s a big reason licensed games frequently miss the mark, sometimes failing to find the tone and nuance that made the original version shine. Avalanche Software navigates those challenges with a deft eye and an evident appreciation for the source books and films. Hogwarts Legacy…]]></summary>

The reveal of Pacific Drive last year immediately grabbed me. I liked what I saw in the initial trailer, sure, but what I found especially intriguing was that most of the game happens through a first-person view of someone driving an old station wagon through a beautiful but distraught Pacific Northwest forest. Rarely do driving games force a first-person view, and even fewer deviate from being a racer. 
Pacific Drive does both, and after viewing roughly 30 minutes of gameplay during a virtual preview, I’m even more intrigued. In a way, Pacific Drive is a racing game, but you’re not racing against other players – you’re racing against a biome ravaged by a mysterious sci-fi force that controls anomalies set on…]]></summary>

On the reasoning for the $69.99 price tag for The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom:
On if this is the trend for Nintendo titles going forward:
Original Story (Published at 5:49 pm Central on February 8, 2023)
The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom could very well be the most anticipated game of 2023 and is certainly one of the most exciting releases in the history of the Nintendo Switch. During today's Nintendo Direct, we got a new look at gameplay, plus the announcement of the Collector's Edition and a new Amiibo figure starring Link. However, we also got some unfortunate news surrounding the upcoming launch of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.
In its press release for the Nintendo Direct, Nintendo announced that the upcoming Zelda entry will retail for $69.99. This makes Nintendo the latest major publish to test the waters of raising the price of its triple-A titles in recent years. This follows other major publishers like 2K Games and PlayStation, who started pricing their major releases at $70 with the start of the new console generation in 2020. Last year, both Xbox and Ubisoft announced that their triple-A games would cost $70 going forward.
We reached out to Nintendo for comment regarding the reasoning for the price increase and if this will be the trend for its triple-A releases going forward, but did not immediately receive a response. We will update this story if Nintendo provides a statement.

By now, Nintendo has brought a large chunk of its most popular and successful games of all time to Switch.

A brief teaser trailer shows the professor trotting through an industrial backdrop. We don't know what mystery he'll unravel or which allies will lend a hand, but it's nice to see the good gentleman back. 


Professor Layton's last title to star him was 2014's The Azaran Legacy. In 2017, a spin-off starring Layton's daughter called Layton's Mystery Journey: Katrielle and the Millionaires' Conspiracy was released for 3DS and was ported to Switch in 2019.]]></summary>

Party Central will feature 40 songs "from across the world’s most popular music genres." Players use the Nintendo Switch's Joy-Con controllers in rhythm with the beat. The game will also have local and online competitive multiplayer and party modes.

Samba de Amigo: Party Central is actually a sequel to the first Samba de Amigo, developed by Sonic Team and first released on the Sega Dreamcast in 1999. It's since been ported to the Wii (though it wasn't very good) and had a long life in arcades.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During today's Nintendo Direct presentation, we saw plenty of new footage of one of the most anticipated games of 2023, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. While you can read all about that right here, we also got some news surrounding some additional ways fans can celebrate the launch of the follow-up to 2017's Breath of the Wild.
First up, Nintendo revealed The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom Collector's Edition. This bundle features the physical version of the game, an artbook with concept art, a steelbook case, an Iconart steel poster, and a set of four pin badges. This Collector's Edition will launch alongside The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and retails for $130.

Additionally, we learned about a new Amiibo figure coming out alongside Tears of the Kingdom. This Amiibo features Link and will grant access to materials and weapons when you scan it with Tears of the Kingdom. Players will also get a special fabric for Link's paraglider.
The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom arrives for Switch on May 12.]]></summary>

Still going by her birth name of Cereza, our hero is still a witch-in-training so she won't be executing flash combos or summoning a litany of demons. Instead, Bayonetta Origins plays more like an adventure game. Along the way, she'll befriend the demon Cheshire who handles all of the fighting. Cerezea lends a hand by magically binding enemies in place using her magic. Outside of combat, the pair combine their powers to overcome platforming obstacles.

Depending on your perspective, we’re either two months early for our usual April 1st release, or a bit tardy for the Christmas 2022 release we intended. We think the wait has been worth it. This is one of the largest releases we’ve done in several years, with numerous features and improvements covering the user interface, gameplay features, and modding extensions for NewGRF and Game Script creators. Some of the highlights are: Variable interface scaling at whatever size you want (not just 2x and 4x), with optional chunky bevels for that retro feel. This includes better automatic scaling when using HiDPI or mixed DPI setups. Direct access to NewGRF/AI/GS settings from the new game window. Various small tweaks and improvements to several windows. NewGRFs can now provide engine variants that are shown hierarchically in the purchase list. Multi-track level crossings to keep road vehicles from stopping in the middle of the crossing. Custom league tables for GameScripts. More natural rivers which get wider as they flow downstream. And much more, which can be seen in the changelog or the previous release announcements! In addition to these features and improvements, we’ve fixed lots of bugs. (If you played with the RC2 testing release, most were fixed before then. See the changelog for full details.)

        <link href="https://www.scummvm.org/news/20230203/"/>
        <updated>2023-02-03T18:07:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few months have passed since we released ScummVM 2.6.1. It's time to prepare for a new release!
Our lovely developers added support, yet again, for a bunch of new ancient games that require testing:
Soldier Boyz
GLK Scott Adams Interactive Fiction games (C64 and ZX Spectrum)
GLK Scott Adams adventures 1-12 (TI99/4A format)
Obsidian
Pink Panther: Passport to Peril
Pink Panther: Hokus Pokus Pink
Driller/Space Station Oblivion
Halls of the Dead: Faery Tale Adventure II
Besides these games, we’d appreciate it if you could check our release testing list. Maybe you’ll even find your favorite game on there that has been sitting on that shelf for way too long - otherwise, there are some demos of these games available on our website.
And since ScummVM is about playing games in general, we’ve seen notable changes across many, many engines - so this is the perfect time for giving your favorites another go.
As usual, we are not just adding support for new games. We are constantly working on improving the engines we already support and, in particular, we’ve seen some incredible work being done on the SCUMM engine. Yes, there are the usual bug fixes, but this time we are also adding a feature that helps playing the SCUMM games in a truly original fashion: Support for the original loading and saving dialogs within the GUI!
Speaking of truly original: Remember those old CRT displays we had back in the day? With ScummVM 2.7.0 you’ll be able to replicate this experience on certain platforms thanks to our new shader-based scalers. Go ahead and give it a try!
All testing must be done with stable builds, not development ones. Please report any bugs or oddities on our issue tracker.
A detailed list of all exciting new features and fixes is available in our NEWS file.
Thank you very much for your support! Let’s make ScummVM 2.7.0 a great release - together!
