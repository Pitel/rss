Most of these maps are downloaded from the Steam Workshop. Afterward, you can play them with friends on private servers, choosing your favorites to hop into a game with.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rainbow Six Siege Operation Twin Shells has finally been released and we have a new Defender joining the roster, Skopós.


Skopós is the 37th Defender, and another 2-Speed 2-Health Operator, joining Rainbow Six Siege in Year 9 Season 3. She will be rocking two Pantheon Shells, basically robots acting as Operators, in a single round. Although you can control only one at a time, the inactive Shell will still provide a lot of value to a round.


Screenshot by Destructoid


All Skopós weapons and gadgets


Skopós uses the new PCX-33 as the only primary weapon. It's a .308 caliber Assault Rifle with a 745 RPM fire rate and comes with a 3.30-second reload speed.


For the secondary firearm, you get to use the P229 pistol. Other Operators such as Hibana, Echo, Goyo, and Grim also have this weapon choice in their loadouts.


Coming to the gadgets, you get to choose between Impact Grenades or Proximity Alarms.


Skopós abilities explained


Skopós controls a pair of V10 Pantheon Shells and justifies the intel or support role in a match. The active Pantheon Shell acts as an Operator while the other acts as an Observation Tool, protected by a reinforced shield.


While playing as Skopós, you can operate only one Shell at a time but you can always switch between them at will. If an enemy kills one shell, you lose connection to both shells. That's how you eliminate Skopós while playing as an Attacker.


How to unlock Skopós in Rainbow Six Siege


To unlock Skopós immediately in Rainbow Six Siege Year 9 Season 3, you have to purchase the Premium Battle Pass which costs 1,200 Credits.


Otherwise, you have to wait 14 days (from September 10) for the early access period to get over and spend 25,000 Renown to unlock her.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following an Early Access launch in March 2024, Ender Magnolia: Bloom in the Mist now has a date for its full release. The sequel to acclaimed 2021 Metroidvania Ender Lilies: Quietus of the Knights will leave Early Access and make its way to PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC on January 22, 2025.


Binary Haze Interactive is on publishing duties for the game from developers Live Wire and Adglobe. In Early Access, the sequel has netted Overwhelmingly Positive review status on Steam, and you can get a feel for the journey through the Land of Fumes in the new trailer below. 




The story of Ender Magnolia is set decades after the events of the first game. Artificial life forms now run rampant throughout the land, and it's up to a corruption-cleansing Attuner named Lilac to set things straight. Players will need to guide Lilac through the land to find the source of the discord between humans and Homunculi, taking on 10 possessed bosses and gaining their abilities in the process.


The 10 abilities earned from bosses each come with three alt-fires, so Lilac will essentially pick up 30 new skills over the course of Ender Magnolia. Up to four abilities can be equipped at a time, so you'll be able to mix up your attacks however you see fit. The music pumping behind all the exploratory action once again comes from indie band Mili.  


Physical versions will go up for pre-order in Japan soon, and there are also plans for other regions. We'll have to wait for more information on boxed releases outside of Japan, so stay tuned.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EA Sports has revealed the top 25 footballers in EA FC 25 from the WSL in the UK, and some amazing-looking cards will be part of the league.


Sam Kerr headlines the list this year with an overall rating of 90. She's also the second highest-rated card in women's football this year, just behind Aitana Bonmati's 91-rated card. While there are no other WSL cards in the 90-ratings club, a few other items are definitely going to be favorites of the community when the game comes out.


Top 25 WSL stars in EA FC 25


Let's first take a look at the complete list before we start dissecting the numbers.



Sam Kerr ST 90


Beth Mead ST 88


Guro Reiten LW 88


Khadija Shaw ST 86


Lauren Hemp LW 86


Lauren James RW 86


Chloe Kelly RW 86


Jill Roord CAM 86


Kim Little CM 86


Alessia Russo ST 85


Lucy Bronze RB 85


Rachel Daly ST 85


Katie McCabe LB 85


Millie Bright CB 85


Caitlin Foord LW 85


Ashley Lawrence RB 85


Vivianne Miedema ST 85


Leah Williamson CB 85


Hasegawa CDM 84


Mariona LW 84


Sandy Baltimore RM 84


Alex Greenwood CB 84


Ella Toone CAM 84


Fran Kirby CAM 84


Kadeisha Buchanan CB 84





Arsenal's Beth Mead and Chelsea's Guro Reiten are the second-highest cards, with overall ratings of 88. Mead has actually received a slight buff to her overall from EA FC 24, as it has risen by +1. Chelsea and Arsenal have a bunch of footballers on this list, as does Manchester City.


Lauren James, Lauren Hemp, and Chloe Kelly are expected to be community favorites in Ultimate Team. In EA FC 24, they ranked high on the meta and are likely to do so once again in EA FC 25. We will have a detailed guide and analysis piece about the best cards in terms of in-game performance once the game goes live on September 20 (in early access).

Sir Ian McKellen was among the first to be approached for his iconic role of Gandalf, and now everyone's favorite bow-wielding Sindar Elf, Legolas, could be added to the lineup.


Orlando Bloom teased his The Lord of the Rings comeback during an interview with Variety, discussing his interest in the upcoming movie. In it, he states, "Yeah, I don't know how they'd do it. I guess with AI you can do anything these days. But, if Peter [Peter Jackson] says jump, I say, 'how high?' I mean, he started my whole career."


Based on this, it's safe to say that Bloom would be open to Legolas' return, but with an AI twist. The Gollum movie will likely be a prequel, so a de-aging proc…]]></summary>

Lena Raine has so much to say, and she’s figured out a lot of different ways to say it all.
Of course, avid game players have been listening to her musical scores for over a decade now, which includes music for Minecraft, as well as the soundtracks for Chicory: A Colorful Tale and the BAFTA-nominated Celeste score. She’s currently scoring the respective follow-ups to those games: Wishes Unlimited's Beastieball and Extremely OK Games' Earthblade.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2 brings the Warhammer 40K universe to life in glorious, blood-soaked detail. This game puts you into the heart of the action in a major conflict with a story that has all the twists and turns of any good galactic incursion in humanity's Imperium. While there are a few issues here and there, it's a triumph of a translation of the miniatures tabletop game into a video game that feels like it has something for everyone.


In Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2, you shoot, rip, and shred your way through a chunky 10-12 hour solo campaign that's a rush or ridiculously meaty combat and iconic encounters from start to end. It also packs in PvE and PvP multiplayer modes that, together, do a great job of easing you into the core mechanics before asking you to go out and maste…]]></summary>

Bumblestone is a yellow-orange gem which has an appearance similar to honeycomb, albeit a little less hollow. Just like all over gems in Disney Dreamlight Valley, you get Bumblestone through mining, but it can only be mined in one very specific location. 


Bumblestone can be mined in The Borderlands, which is the most expensive area of the Glittering Dunes to unlock. You’ll need to grind for a while and save up 10,000 Mist in order to unlock the Borderlands, and then you’re free to go mining for Bumblestone.

Whenever I visit family in the States and find myself in a derelict shopping plaza or some other place affected by America's depressing sense of architectural planning and overreliance on cars, I can't help but feel a sense of dread.
Devil's Hideout, a point and click horror game made by indie dev Cosmic Void, takes place in one such abandoned American city, and manages to deliver on this sense of dread even if its eerie hellscape is rough around the edges.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the most divisive mechanics since its addition to the franchise, the ability to flop is seen by many NBA 2K25 players as a good tool when facing even matchups, as well as a sure way to lighten the mood when playing with friends.  


But how can you perform the move in the game? Here's how to perform flops in NBA 2K25. 


How to flop in NBA 2K25


A MyCarrer exclusive feature, you can flop in NBA 2K25 by simply pressing the down-direction button on your controller. But you won't be able to do so from the get-go. Instead, you will need to first purchase and equip the emote to your MyPlayer. You can check out how to purchase and equip the flop animation below: 



While in MyCarrer, head to Animations before going to the Animations Store.


Head to In-Game Celebrations and then to either NBA Pro-AM Standing or Park Standard.


Select the flop animation on either section and then head to Cart to purchase it. The animation will cost 100 VC.


Head to the Gameplay Animations tab and equip Flop to both NBA Pro-AM Standing and Park Standard to get access to it.

Should you flop in NBA 2K25?


I don't recommend performing or having the flop emote equipped in NBA 2K25, no matter if you plan on using it while building your legacy or while letting off steam in The City. The reason for that is quite simple, even if we consider the small chance a foul will be called after performing it, you will 100% of the time open a path for the attacker. When playing any non-5v5 mode, that will then lead to guaranteed points. Performing it by mistake when playing on defense can also give a feeling that you are throwing the game. 


Now that you know how to perform flops, don't forget to also check out the best jump shots for all builds, as well as all badge requirements in NBA 2K25.

        <updated>2024-09-10T16:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Analogue has announced the next special edition color lineup for their Analogue Pocket consoles. These ones are based on the colors of Nintendo’s Game Boy Color handhelds.


The GBC Colors Edition (I know, Game Boy Color Colors, but it’s an understandable distinction) brings 6 new special edition, er, colors. There’s Dandelion, Kiwi, Grape, Teal, Berry, and Gold. Now, if you’re really astute, you might be thinking, “Why Gold and not Atomic Purple,” since that was the actual six colors available at release. I can’t tell you for certain, but it’s probably because they already had a translucent purple as part of their transparent series. Correct me if I’m wrong, but I believe the Pokemon Gold/Silver special edition GBC was gold? I researched this, but couldn’t find one in good lighting.


Anyway, the GBC Colors Editions are functionally the same as previous models. They’re FPGA-powered handhelds that can run  Game Boy, Game Boy Color, and Game Boy Advance games using hardware emulation, which is significantly more accurate than the usual software emulation that cheaper clones use. People like them. I like their Analogue Duo. More colors are neat.


I got the Kiwi Green shade of GBC when I was younger. I also got a matching green carrying case with a Pikachu on it. It had a thin shoulder strap and my sister and cousins teased me, calling it the Poképurse. In retrospect, that’s not very insulting, but they called it that in a really mean way, so I kind of felt ashamed. This is why I have shame and guilt issues as an adult. A contributing factor, at least.


The GBC Colors editions of the Analogue Pocket will go up for sale on September 12th at 8am PDT and ship within 24 to 48 hours. A restock of the original black/white versions are also coming at that time. The special Editions run for $249.99 USD, which is $30 more expensive than the normal, non-limited colors.

I nearly missed this. The friend who gave me the news had missed it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During Fortnite's Chapter 5, Season 4 story questline, you'll use various War Machine weapons to eliminate opponents before returning to Captain Jones and discussing the next action plan. However, even if you have the mission active, you won't find a map marker for this particular character.


Captain Jones location in Fortnite Chapter 5, Season 4


Captain Jones is an NPC that spawns in two separate locations. The first spot is a building between the Nitrodrome and The Raft. Nestled between these two POIs is an unnamed location where Captain Jones will roam around, waiting for you to report back to him during this season's storyline.


Screenshot by Destructoid


More specifically, this spot is next to a railroad track directly east of The Raft, southwest of Restored Reels, and northwest of the Nitrodome. It can be hard to find initially, so keep your eyes peeled for a large building near this section of the tracks.


Screenshot by Destructoid


His more common spawn spot is at an unnamed location between Restored Reels and Nitrodome. This time, rather than heading slightly west past the railroad track, you'll move toward a small building between these two spots, east of the road.


Screenshot by Destructoid


Since these aren't popular landing spots, you'll likely only find a few other players in these areas. However, if someone arrives at The Raft to eliminate Emma Frost or the Nitrodome, they might pass through these locations and catch you. Watch your surroundings, and don't be afraid to search around for weapons beforehand.


Captain Jones has multiple uses in Fortnite outside of story quests. You can talk to him to restore your health or buy weapons like the Captain America Shield and Monarch Pistols. There's also extra dialogue about other characters you'll find in the event if you're interested in some Fortnite and Marvel lore.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new title update is available for Madden 25, and it brings some much-requested changes on all available platforms.


Despite a smooth launch, certain fundamental issues have irritated the players, especially on the defensive side. I have found problems with the defensive coverages outside the deep third, and it now appears that they were working in an unintended fashion. While the total number of fixes in this patch is few, they do take care of some core gameplay concerns.


Madden 25 Title Update patch notes


EA Sports has released the patch notes on Madden 25's community forum, and the official blog post is also available on X. Let's examine all the changes.



Addressed the issue with Smart Routed Custom Stems, resulting in a Speed Boost off the line at the snap


Tuning to decrease the effectiveness of a specific QB-rollout speed boost exploit


Addressed an issue preventing the Curl Flat zone depth coach adjustment from working properly when set at less than 15 yards


Addressed an issue causing Curl Flat defenders to continue to drift away from an eligible receiving threat in close proximity


Addressed an issue causing outside Deep Third defenders to get out of position when covering corner routes, or giving up too much cushion vs. corner routes.


Addressed an issue in Squads causing the QB control to switch to a teammate at the snap



Aside from improper zone coverages, using Smart Routed Custom Stems would sometimes result in an unfair boost at the snap. That problem will likely cease to exist, thanks to the latest update. Similarly, the effectiveness of QB-rollout speed boost has also been nerfed.


Fans will certainly hope that the changes made by the September 10 title update will resolve some of the concerns they have had with the gameplay so far.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony kicked off the PS5 Technical Presentation with Mark Cerny by jumping right into the announcement of the PS5 Pro. Cerny then took some time to talk about how cool the PS5 is.


He then talks about how developers want higher framerates than 60fps. Or especially higher than 30fps. Apparently, players choose Performance over Fidelity three-quarters of the time. I tend to swap between the two, depending on the game. The framerate thing seems to be the focus of the presentation.




When going over the hardware, Cerny says that it will have a 67% "larger" GPU with 28% faster RAM that apparently renders at 45% faster. It improves Ray Tracing speeds. It is also implementing AI Upscaling (PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution, as they call it). They showed a few games running on both systems and how it improves the framerate without cutting down on the appearance of the game.


Color me unimpressed. I can see the difference, sure, but it doesn’t seem all that dramatic. The presentation really pushed the framerate thing. I like higher framerates, but this feels like worse value than I’d get by upgrading my GPU, which, to be fair, could cost about as much as the PS5 Pro. The upgraded visuals seem pretty miniscule for the price they’re asking. There's also no disc drive, so you'd be paying extra for that. For the deep-pocketed enthusiast, I suppose.


If you’re into it, it’s going to set you back $699. For me, I could barely afford the base model. I'll probably skip on the upgrade. Unless you want to gift it to me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The final two parts of Fortnite's Part Four: The Illusionist questline have you spreading graffiti around Doomstadt and ruining its central statue with spray paint. Whether this is a good thing is certainly debatable, but at least the EXP rewards are nice. 


How to graffiti Doomstadt in Fortnite 


Graffitiing Doomstadt requires using sprays to paint icons around the landmark. You can find your sprays by opening your emote menu and hovering over any you currently have equipped. For this particular quest, you'll have to do this four times, alongside one final time on Doomstadt's central statue.

If you didn't have any icons active before, you'll receive the Hopeful Llama spray in your emote wheel, allowing you to finish this quest even as a new player. It also doesn't matter where you use your sprays as long as you stay within Doomstadt. 


With any Fortnite quest comes the risk of encountering enemies, including Mysterio, his henchmen, and other players. Watch for any incoming threats, and be prepared to hide, run away, 


How to graffiti Doomstadt's Central Statue in Fortnite


Graffitiing Doomstadt's central statue is the last task of The Illusionist questline, and it's pretty simple now that you know how to use sprays. You'll find the central statue in Doomstadt's center plaza, where Mysterio spawns.

However, since Mysterio patrols this area, there's a high risk of him or other enemies aggroing on you once you enter the plaza. Make sure to run in here quickly, hop up to the statue, and use your spray before leaving to lower the risk of this happening. As soon as you graffiti the statue, you'll unlock the Hopeful Llama spray and finish part four of the Fortnite x Marvel story.

Sonic Adventure and Sonic Adventure 2 are beloved among Sonic fans, but not just for the fast-paced Sonic (or Shadow) stages or the cracking music. The Chao Garden, a side activity in both games, is beloved even today, and fans have been dying to see a standalone Chao Garden game where we can raise our cute little critters.
However, we should probably start tempering our expectations: in an interview with VGC, Sonic Team head Takashi Iizuka suggested that there are no plans for a standalone Chao game because it's a "piece" of other games.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The word “Shadowrun” is like a magnet for me. It’s like the smell of weird lab bread at Subway; it just hits me in an irresistible way. Apparently, Jordan Weisman, one of Shadowrun’s creators, is teaming up with some other veteran developers to bring us Sea of Legends. It will start its journey on Kickstarter on October 1.


There’s a lot to unpack here, so let’s start with the game. Sea of Legends is described as “a deck-building, open-world, computer role-playing game.” The press release also says to “Imagine a new Sid Meiers’ Pirates game with the tactics and narrative of Shadowrun and Slay the Spire’s deck-building mechanics.”


Image via Endless Adventures


It also sums up the team behind it as including, “Andrew McIntosh, Lead Writer of Battletech, Shadowrun: Dragonfall, and Shadowrun: Hong Kong, Jeffery Campbell, Narrative Designer on Darkest Dungeon, Dead Rising 4, and Deus Ex: Mankind Divided, Kate Cruz, Senior Concept artist on Ubisoft’s Skull & Bones, and Jordan Weisman himself.” There are some things in that list that should maybe have caveats, but, regardless, it’s a good team. It’s based on the tabletop game by Zach Weisman and Ryan Schapals.


It’s also being made in the Adventure Forge platform. I spoke to Jordan Weisman about it some yonks back. It’s a no-code engine that incorporates generative AI for art assets if the creator wants it (it doesn’t say if Sea of Legends will use it). It will, at the very least, be a demonstration of what the tool can do.


I’m interested to see how naval combat is handled. I’m also interested in the feature “lovers to woo.” So, basically, I’m into sailing and smooching. The mock-up included shows the ability to fight, negotiate, or romance to get some treasure. Not sure how that last one works. "We should spend all this gold on a dog that we can spoil together."


The Sea of Legends Kickstarter campaign will kick off on October 1, 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Part of your quest to defeat Marvel villains in Fortnite is targeting specific landmarks and weakening their forces before sending your team into a final battle. During Part Four: The Illusionist, you'll target Mysterio by messing around with Doomstadt, including destroying various surveillance cameras monitoring the area.


Where to find surveillance cameras in Fortnite


You'll find surveillance cameras scattered around Doomstadt, particularly along the outer walls of buildings, looking down at various pathways. Below are some specific locations for them:



Along the walls and building foundations surrounding the central statue


On building pillars, including ones on Doomstadt's outer edges


Scattered around the city, pointing toward alleyways and sidewalks

They'll appear as small green and white cameras throughout the landmark, each with around 80 health. You likely won't break them instantly with one pickaxe swing or gunshot, but at least they're weaker than slurp barrels and players.


Although you need to break five surveillance cameras to finish this quest, there are far more than five in Doomstadt to target. They'll always be along solid surfaces like walls, building foundations, and pillars, so focus on checking these areas first for the best odds of finding all five quickly. They're also all outside, so don't worry about going inside buildings for these.


You'll also have to watch for other players, henchmen, and Mysterio, as usual. Entering the center square puts you at risk of entering Mysterio's line of sight, while outer areas might have a player that can catch you off guard with attacks and eliminate you. Make sure to have extra weapons handy and a few hiding spots in mind just in case.

All those onscreen 'Nids, yeah? And the stutterfest that was the recent preview build? Surely enough to make a Tech-Priest shed at least one oily tear.
But nah, turns out it’s fine. Pretty good, actually – perhaps not to the extent that you should tackle Space Marine 2 on a crusty notebook (or, for the record, a Steam Deck), but it runs decently on minimum specs and is noticeably more stable than in that preview. The only thing that might offend your PC’s machine spirit is some quality setting weirdness, where dropping or raising the graphics options can produce inconsistent results.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Although Fortnite's quests usually have you eliminating enemies, looking for items, and visiting specific locations, the Marvel storyline is a little different. During Part Four: The Illusionist, your first objective is to drop low-quality weapons in Doomstadt. Fortunately, this is quick and easy if you know a few tricks.


How to toss common items at Doomstadt in Fortnite


Tossing common items at Doomstadt is another way of saying you need to throw away your weapons. Doing this requires getting at least one common-tier or grey item, traveling to Doomstadt, and throwing it on the ground. You can do this with the same weapon multiple times, so don't worry about looking for five items throughout your match.


The easiest way to do this is to head directly to Doomstadt at the beginning of the match, look around for grey ground loot, and pick it up. Ground items are usually grey or green-quality anyway, so this shouldn't be too difficult.

From here, open your inventory, hover over your common item, and press the drop button to toss the weapon onto the ground. Now, you can pick it up and repeat the process five times to quickly knock out this quest without much issue.


The only obstacle you might encounter is enemy players finding you and defeating you before you finish dropping your items. Mysterio can also come out of nowhere and attack you if you run within his area of detection. Watch out and listen for anyone nearby, and pick an obscure location, like inside a building or near a hiding spot, to keep yourself away from others. In dire situations, you can sit beside a car and drive away briefly if your character is close to death before returning and finishing the objective.

Concord's servers were closed just 14 days after its launch due to a poor reception from players and feedback that Sony and developer Firewalk Studios received from fans during the game's incredibly short lifespan. As of September 10, 2024, I've now found that my digital copy of the game is completely locked so that my PS5 can't even attempt to launch it, and I've seen reviewers say their copies have been removed from their PlayStation Network libraries.

Over the past few years, Atari has been revisiting its storied history with compilation titles, remakes, reboots, and surprise sequels. So while a revival of Yars’ Revenge really shouldn’t have come as much of a surprise, we have to admit to being a bit taken aback by Yars Rising. After all, what was once a stylish, yet basic top-down shooter has now been transformed into a full-blown Metroidvania with anime-inspired character design, a bonkers, world-ending plot, and gameplay that blends stealth, hacking, and good ol’-fashioned gunplay. Atari, yer mad.
The thing is, though, it works. We can’t imagine that this is the future kids in the early ‘80s had in mind when they first shoved that massive Yars’ Revenge cartridge into an Atari 2600 (and maybe OG developer Howard Scott Warshaw’s long-gestating sequel will be more on par with expectations), but after completing Yars Rising, we honestly couldn’t be more thrilled by developer WayForward’s ambitious interpretation of such a classic.

Though those who have seen the first of these titles right to the end, the real end, might notice that the muscles aren't kicking in like they used to on the final boss fight. Surely we haven't become worse at games with age? Well, maybe not.
As flagged on Twitter by @JupiterClimb, Dawn of Sorrow's secret 'Julius Mode' is now home to an added challenge in the final fight as the big bad's attacks aren't as easily evaded as they were back in 2005.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A baby's gotta do what a baby's gotta do.
That Rugrats has somehow managed to remain in the public consciousness for so long is impressive in its own right. This is in part down to Nickelodeon continuing to screen it for younger generations, and that the show ran for 13 years across 172 episodes and spawned two feature films. The most important reason for its extended shelf life, though, is its unexpectedly broad appeal. Formulated by Hungarian-born Gábor Csupó and his wife, Arlene Klasky, Rugrats appeared to be a show about babies for babies, but it was actually a show about babies for children and adults. Thanks to clever writing and a deeper maturity — commonplace during the Simpsons-inspired '90s — those who loved it 30 years ago will still enjoy it today.
Rugrats: Adventures in Gameland’s most essential victory, then, isn’t necessarily its stage design or graphical style, but tapping into the show's intelligence. It's a shame the original voice cast is unavailable, with exchanges instead represented in text, but you can still recall Tommy’s raspy tones in your head.

Except. Except that sooner or later I start thinking about the roots.

The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is absolutely stuffed to the brim with characters, mechanics, enemies, and things to do. However, one glaring omission is Kass, Breath of the Wild's travelling Rito minstrel. Luckily for fans, the recently released Master Works Book does propose a few scenarios as to where Kass may be in the sequel.
Zelda Lore shared an excerpt of the book on Twitter (thanks to Gaming Reinvented for the tip) which covers the potential whereabouts of Kass in Tears of the Kingdom. The bird isn't present in Hyrule at all in the game, with no explanation at all given for his absence. He's not even mentioned. At least, until the Master Works book.

The furore across the internet upon the announcement of the Marvel vs Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics, however, seemed to burn twice as bright.
Featuring seven titles, there’s nothing but gold across the board. It includes every pixel-drawn Marvel fighting game up to and including Marvel vs. Capcom 2, and all arcade originals. Capcom has ploughed the package with bonuses, from beautifully defined CRT filters and music players to original arcade art galleries, region switching, superb training modes, save states, and 4:3 screen bezels. For online play, Capcom's own rollback netcode is present and working fluidly. Although we can’t comment on how it will hold up when the servers go global, we’re optimistic it will be well maintained. You can hop in and out of matches, take on casual and ranked match-ups, and spectate freely. It’s quite the fighting festival, and buffed to a shine.

Yooka-Replaylee was a bit of a welcome surprise when it was announced back in June. It looks utterly gorgeous and promises plenty of tweaks, changes, and accessibility features when it eventually launches. But one thing that many fans spotted was Laylee, Yooka's purple bat companion, and her new, incredibly fluffy design.
In a Q&A published on the Playtonic YouTube Channel, community manager Steve James sat down with members of the Yooka-Replaylee art team — Ed Bryan, Nikita De Ruysscher, and Steve Mayles — to talk about the game's brand new look. And one section focuses on the wisecracking bat.

In a recent interview on the Fragments of Silicon podcast, WayForward's James Montagana revealed how last year's collaboration came to be, stating that the team had been meeting with Nintendo at every E3 for seven or eight years.

Researchers from tech company Virtuals Protocol have published a paper on a new text-to-video AI model, MarioVGG, which can simulate Super Mario Bros. footage via some basic text inputs (thanks, ArsTechnica).
The model was fed over 737,000 Mario Bros. frames, showing Nintendo's prized plumber in 32 different levels with varying degrees of success and failure (141 wins and 139 losses, according to Github). Based on these images, and how they are arranged, the AI model "learns" what commands such as "jump" and "run" correspond to on-screen and is then capable of simulating such commands in a video format, physics and all.

They've now published another blog post that torches the vagueness of the previous post with the righteously democratic flames of specificity. Overhauls to enemies are on the way, less-loved guns will be more effective, reworks to armor penetration and health values are on the boil, and they're taking inspiration from "player fantasies" for certain weapons and stratagems. All of these tweaks are set to go live on the 17th September, so not long to wait.

Including one bug that sometimes made the game's final boss accidentally invincible. Ah. Yesterday's patch seems to target the worst of these bugs, and the dev team promise there are more fixes are to come.

"It was too big for a single person to make," Byrne wrote at the time. "This is the root of the problem. It wasn't that I fell out of love with the idea, just that I can't physically do it." That was then and this, thankfully, is now. Byrne has tentatively returned to the project and begun sharing screens on social media.

It's a crying shame that it's not currently available to buy anywhere digitally, presumably because the rights are soaked in a gutter between EA (the original publisher) and Microsoft (who bought and closed developers Lionhead).

If you do still own a physical copy of Black & White however, you might be interested in Openblack. It's a fan-led project to create a modern, open source engine for running Black & White, and its first build was just released yesterday.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Every time you load up Agentia you are reincarnated as a different creature. "Creature" is perhaps too narrow a word - the game's "playable characters" range from geese, microscopic life and triceratops to menhirs and small rocky islands. Each forms the heart of a diamond of delicately drawn, isometric grid terrain with a baby mobile canopy of clouds and sun. It looks like an illustration from an old botanical or geographical textbook, although the inviting emptiness around the visible area also dimly reminds  me of certain elder RPGs I used to play on Macintosh.

Specifically, it did not forget about the incorrigible evil-doers amongst you who've been gunning for some additional plot catharsis. Larian's very bestest RPG has been biding its time in the shadows while you've been busy with other games. It has lingered silently while you've been off heisting on Tatooine or getting all messed up by Golden-Eyed Beasts, waiting and watching for the perfect moment - and now, it has finally struck with an unholy new patch, which adds 13 new Evil Endings, revamped splitscreen and an official modding toolkit. Foolish summer child! It is too late to flee.

I grab the faulty power transformer without listening, and am immediately electrocuted. Worse still, I have to hammer a quick-time button to recover. This is what it is like to be Jerry, the janitor of a cheap and poorly maintained space station. Jerry is being tasked with repair work beyond his job description, learning the ins and outs of an escape pod's machinery from his co-worker via radio. This may come in handy, as the station is about to explode. Tin Can is not a new game (it came out in 2022) but it is on sale as part of Steam's space exploration fest. And I enjoy a space game that makes me panic while alarms go off everywhere.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Full disclosure: I hadn't heard of Bakeru until Graham mentioned it to me. Graham always has his hands on the video game pulse, gliding them over Xwitter or Steam or wherever and waiting for that "ker kun, ker kun" of a new Cool Thing. And that cool thing is Bakeru, described by its Steam page as "Japan-esque", but is in actual fact, very Japanese. I mean, you travel around 47 Japanese prefectures as a metamorphing tanuki who bashes evilness with his taiko drum sticks. Come on.
What I hadn't suspected was Bakeru's chops not only as a platformer, but as a means to increase your chances at success in pub quizzes. The game is a certified trivia Tardis, where you'll learn all sorts about Japanese culture as well as just like, the colour sepia being a genus of cuttlefish.

This is a fairly standard feature for a lot of blockbuster games, but in the world of Warhammer 40K there are so many mega-scale battles with pitch-perfect composition that I found it hard to resist hitting pause and taking a handful of snaps every few minutes. With a keen eye (and a beefy PC) you can capture some wonderfully violent moments.

They're claiming (via in-game broadcast) that the fleeting appearance of a weird purple blob on the map screen is actually the result of fluids leaking from the corpse of a long-dead comms technician, stranded on a server farm somewhere. Who to believe? Ah, if only we had some means of shedding light on the reports. Some way of Illuminating the situation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bear with me on this, but I adore how swordfighting works in Dune. Ubiquitous wearable sci-fi shields repel any attack that comes in too fast, so everyone has to learn this unique, overtly dance-like form of close-quarters combat where every thrust and parry is necessarily slow and considered. Picture it: careful judgments of your movements, weighing up the right time to strike, every measured jab part of a wider strategy that culminates in the kill.
MOBAs are like that. Both in the fights themselves, sort of, where probing lunges lead up to bursts of lethality, but more broadly in each match as a whole. They’re map-wide knife fights, where a thrust is a well-judged lane push and a parry a savvy item buy. At first, playing Smite 2 felt akin to watching on helplessly as my opponents repeatedly shoved their crysknives through my ribs. After 30 hours, it often still feels like that - but I am enjoying myself. Mostly. Despite Valve’s third-person elephant in the lane.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nikhil Murthy's Syphilisation is a "postcolonial 4X game", which might sound like a contradiction in terms. While approaches to 4X and grand strategy vary hugely between games, factions and players, the genre as a whole is firmly wedded to imperial conquest, both structurally and at the level of narrative aspects and set-dressing. Many 4X games are triumphal re-enactments of specific periods of colonial settlement and expansion. All of which is to say that Syphilisation is fascinating. It's a reworking of the genre which dismantles and reconstructs concepts such as diplomacy, research and production. It's also just left early access - find more details and a playthrough video below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been 13 years since the first Space Marine came out. While it wasn't outstanding in the grander landscape of gaming, enough Warhammer 40K fans seem to have cherished the escapades of bulky blue boltgunner Demetrian Titus for the action game to merit a sequel a decade later. It left its story on something of a cliffhanger, with said hero being dragged away to face untold tortures by the Inquisition, the most zealous sect of this preternaturally paranoid sci-fi universe. Today, Titus is free again. Free to stomp towards hordes of alien foes, blast them with a plasma incinerator, and shred the stragglers with a chainsaw sword. Space Marine 2 is an often-satisfying scrapper that has me  convinced of 40K's merit as a crafting ground for excellent-looking environments and creatures, even if I'm not particularly moved by the bland character of Titus and his fellow Ultramarines.

As such, I am now obliged by the eternal laws of journalistic accountability to state that anything Minecraft-related is rubbish.

Snuck out over winter 2022, it was a sombre but delightful freebie with immense though well-hidden imagination, in which your only explicit objective was to find a way out of a small concrete city.
Now, developers Lemaitre Bros are making a gott-dang 1v1 FPS called Straftat, slated for release on 24th October 2024 with over 100 arenas. It's similarly in love with concrete, but it also has blunderbusses, dual-wielding, Gatling guns, corner-peeking, curved swords, cowboy hats and beehive hairdos.

Deliver At All Costs is a chaotic courier sim set in those heady days that sees the player barrelling around a "semi-open" US town as they take on absurd odd jobs. "From delivering a giant flailing Marlin, to the disposal of an atomic bomb teetering on the edge of explosion," say the developers, "always expect the unexpected." It's maybe best understood by witnessing the moment in the trailer below where the player drifts right through a menswear store, bringing the whole building down. Yep, that looks like a good time.

To shreds, I say - it’s currently sitting at 79% ‘mostly negative’ rating on Steam. Among the chief complaints are…uh, everything, it looks like. The DLC is reportedly so bug-ridden that it’s taken many of the base game’s core systems down with it.
Gearbox - who acquired Risk Of Rain from Hopoo Games in 2022 - have since put out a blog with a list of known issues they’re targeting, and encourage players to keep submitting bug reports. Among the listed issues are a boss named Mithrix becoming invincible (“definitely not intentional”), and “an issue that allowed players to get stuck while smelling the flowers”.

Well, this'll make things easier: both games are currently free to keep as part of the Fallout Classic Collection over on the Epic Games Store.

Fallout Tactics is free, too, but I don't know whether Todd's cruel enough to want people to experience that one as it was.

Fortunately, I've spent my penance playing the demo for Witching Stone, which applies the magic of shape-matching to the magic of, well, magic. Out on 16th September, it's a pixelart charmer that "combines elements of puzzle games, roguelites and deckbuilders", much as you'd combine a red circle and two golden triangles to spark a lightning bolt.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the first post for my series on "saving" open world design, I complained that many of today's open worlds feel like checklists of formulaic tasks and rewards, their geography a vaporous staging ground for itemisable, cycling content-gathering opportunities, which flies in the face of the sense of freedom and wonder they're supposed to inspire. My interviewees, Elder Scrolls veterans Matt Firor and Nate Purkeypile, argued that this reflects the expense and scale of today's open world productions, which constrains experimental design both at a practical level and in terms of overall direction.
CD Projekt open world designer Jakub Tomczak doesn't, as far as I know, have an answer to the issue of production bloat, but he does have a disarmingly obvious solution to the 'checklist problem', based on his time creating missions for Cyberpunk 2077 and its Phantom Liberty expansion: get better at hiding the checklist. Weave it into the landscape and setting more artfully, with an elegant balance of randomisation and responsiveness to the player's behaviour which keeps everything fresh.

If you missed its announcement in May, The Forever Winter is a co-op extraction shooter set in a grim future where you struggle to survive amid an unending hyperindustrial war. Since that reveal developers Fun Dog Studios have mostly been sending out small "burst transmissions" - essentially footage from the hellfront - like this patriotic beheading and some panicked gunfights. But today they've made a longer video revealing an early access release date. And - oh! - it's quite soon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I won an awful board game from Nickelodeon once. I say “won”. Actually, I got disconnected phoning into a competition line after I’d gotten through, got upset loudly, my mum called them to complain, they fast tracked me to the next competition thing, I got the quiz answer wrong, and the presenter pretended he’d heard the right answer and pulled a prize out of the big prize bucket. It was a copy of The Game of Life, possibly the least exciting board game a child can win.
The game was dog water, and there’s probably a lesson in there somewhere about how cool and good it is to whine until you get free things, but we don’t have time for that. Instead, I’d like to draw your attention to Floops Big House Adventure. It’s a grungy, slimy, Aaahh!!! Real Monsters meets Ren and Stimpy Saturday morning shooter. Some of you will already hate it from the header screenshot, I imagine. Personally, the art drew me right in.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The first time I encountered Jack King-Spooner's work, it was when he sent me a copy of Sluggish Morss: Pattern Circus over hospital wifi late at night. The game was a bright spot in a bad time, which might seem peculiar given that Sluggish Morss often looks like a whale's upset stomach, but it's such a feverishly inventive creation. It blew the dust from my synapses.
The same appears true of King-Spooner's upcoming Judero, on which he is collaborating with Soul Searching developer Talha Kaya. It casts you as a "pagan seer" armed with a big stick, who is searching the mythical Scottish borderlands for evil creatures to clobber. It looks cheerier and airier than Sluggish Morss, with a more overt emphasis on mechanics such as combat, but it has the same pickled 3am energy to it. It's also now got a release date - 16th September - and a new trailer below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The situation: Sumo Newcastle are making a dystopian on-foot multiplayer racing game called Deathsprint 66, in which you control one of eight Running Men hurtling through the spiked and bladed contours of a futuristic megacity. The complication: competing against other actual human beings isn't always pleasant or desirable, especially when hurtling through the spiked and bladed contours of a futuristic megacity. The solution: Deathsprint 66 is getting a set of PvE-focussed "Episodes" in which just one human player plus optional bots hurtle through the spiked and bladed contours of a futuristic megacity.

The opening radio chat between starting squad member Sid and a pal has that telltale charming tinge of overeager cockney. It also contains the words “bloody” and “arse” in quick succession, though thankfully not next to each other. The only piles are the logs Sid’s crouched behind as he prepares to sneak up to a cable car guarded by Nazis. That is the only haemorrhoids allusion I will ever make on this website. Until the next time I have to write about Andrew Wilson.
“Oil just use my trusty knoife” mutters Sid as I take down my first guard. Straight away, the animation and noise indicators evoke the same Shadow Tactics or Desperados III goodness you’re probably expecting. Fine with me - that’s exactly what I’m here for. Mimimi’s closing was a real gutpunch, and while I don’t expect anyone to match their exceptional work any time soon, it’s at least reassuring to see Warsaw studio Artificer picking up the torch.

It seems there was more to that story than concern about the progress of Marathon. According to a new Bloomberg report citing anonymous sources, Barrett was in fact fired this spring after he was accused by several female Bungie staff of inappropriate behaviour.

Please let it still be under 40 – and realise with alarm that, by extrapolation, a lot of the people reading this probably have children. Augh, children! Please excuse me while I go stand on a chair, clutching a broom. I’ve never understood the craze for generating smaller versions of yourself. It’s one of those weirder subcultures you read about in the papers, but rarely observe in daily life. 


I do, however, understand the appeal of same-screen co-op games like Run From Mummies - which, being a bloodless comedy dungeon romp, seems like a fair pick for those encumbered with boisterous selfspawn. Don’t worry, the “mummies” of the title are just regular old disembowelled corpses wrapped in cloth, not those sinister, non-embalmed “mothers” you’ve been hearing about down the grocers.

When ten citizens dropped dead on the roads of one of my settlements in post-apocalyptic city builder Endzone 2, I had to work fast to avoid a sickness breaking out. But graveyards require a lot of space, and if you've already filled your shanty town with a sea of corrugated metal roofs, this poses a problem. Welcome to the pleasant headache of town planning in a post-nuclear world, where most of the land is brown and uninhabitable.

While it's not quite as chaotic and entangled as say, Disgaea, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is one of those games. I'd call it "baroque", but that would be out of synch with developer Sandfall Interactive's stated influences: the new RPG takes place in a molten and fragmented fantasy world based on the Belle Époque or "beautiful era" of late 19th century France. Your job as player is to stop a sorcerous Paintress from painting everybody over a certain age out of existence. We'll circle back to the plot, though. First, the excessively ornate battlin'.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stormgate is a confusing proposition. It's an RTS directed by former Blizzard developers that is almost, but not quite, entirely unlike StarCraft. It's a free-to-play game, but has a business model that makes you feel like you're getting a rougher deal than if you just dropped thirty notes for it outright. It's available now in Early Access, but has already been available in a kind of gravity-defying Super Early Access for several weeks (which you had to pay to get into).


All of which has made me feel very tired, and yearn for the days when you went into a shop and bought a game in a box for a set amount of money, and the whole game was in the box and you went home and put it on your PC and played it until your mum said "Richard!" (only my mum calls me Richard) "get off that computer and go outside and get some exercise! Do you want to be dead at 35?" Well, I'm 36 now mum. Nearly 37. So who's laughing through their heart palpitations now?

Paris, 28th August 2024 – The Union of Video Game Workers (Syndicat des
Travailleurs (ses) du Jeu Vidéo) has publicly relayed allegations concerning the
working environment at Spiders. The false and even defamatory accusations made by
the STJV in no way reflect the reality of the day-to-day working life of the company's
employees and are an attack on the reputation of the studio, whose teams are fully
mobilized to produce quality games and enthusiastically ensure the Early Access
release of GreedFall 2.

Spiders' management is committed to open and constructive social dialogue. After
unsuccessful attempts over the last few days to meet with a delegation of employees,
they have proposed a meeting again by the end of the week.

Spiders' employees are the heart of the studio, and we are determined to maintain an
inclusive and stimulating working environment in which every talent can flourish and of
which we can all be proud.

The email was signed by Consulting Director Caroline Richard and Associate Director Laurence Tovi.

While it would be a monumentally silly heel turn to go back on their promise of only charging Space Marine 2 players extra for cosmetics a mere week and change before the shooter’s September 9 release date,  the new year one roadmap does at least look piously forthright.
Chatting to James at Gamescom recently (possibly from his cathedral ship made out of graphics cards), Saber boss Tim Willits dragged out an armoured horse and proceeded to flog it mercilessly, saying that players don’t want to be sold the equivalent of Oblivion's infamous deadbeat daddy of DLCs. As several of you identified, this seemed like an odd comparison when Spice Maureen 2 specifically plans to charge for comparable cosmetics, although I imagine Willits was referencing the “packs” that his space game’s baubles come in. “Our fans never thought we ripped them off in World War Z,” he said, comparing Space Marine 2’s optional spendables to that game.
Whether you see the cosmetic's pricing as egregious or not, yesterday’s roadmap does look to make good on Saber’s promise to keep wearables and playables separate. Here’s it:

Still, I'll admit to a twinge of disappointment after reading that a Crash Bandicoot 5 was once in development at Crash 4: It's About Time developers Toys For Bob, and might have featured an interdimensional team-up with one of Crash's old rivals. No, not Mario.

Because while its planets and cities do feel ersatz as living places, they’re kind of incredible as film sets. That’s your job here. This is where the game is. You don’t play it so much as you perform your role in a series of loving, enthusiastic callbacks. That’s a star war. This is a star war. Oh, hey, I know that! That’s one of my favourite star warses.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The slugcat of Rain World is a distinct little character. He flops around, squeezing through narrow tunnels with a movement that's both cute and mildly gross. When he is eaten by a passing disco lizard or ravenous skull-faced vulture, it is because he is basically a delicious Squirmle existing in a horrifying cryptozoological ecosystem. He is, however, never stepped upon by a mech with a missile launcher. He is never given a shotgun and tasked with shooting the other animals. Yet that basically seems to be the elevator pitch for Uruc, a sci-fi metroidvania set in a distant future where strange life battles mechanical monstrosities.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been a while since I last played World Of Warcraft, but that doesn't stop me from listening to the Elwynn Forest theme whenever I need to decompress. And as I understand it, WoW's latest expansion The War Within adds to a game that's largely unrecognisable from those vanilla days. That's not necessarily a bad thing, and with TWW out this very second it does make me think, "Hmmm, what if I do make a return". This happens every time. I'd quite like to see the new continent, the new class features, and the expanded Skyriding.

At last, we quit the disgusting sunlit months. At last we leave all that is green and good behind, and return to the time of monsters.
Supermassive Games and Behaviour Interactive must have gotten the memo too. They've just released a demo for their next horror game The Casting Of Frank Stone, in which you are a policeman, Sam Green, who is investigating the disappearance of a child. The search leads you to Cedar Hills Steel Mill, "where chilling secrets await, revealing a far more sinister truth than anyone could have anticipated". I am anticipating: QTEs during escape sequences, branching choices that get people killed, and General Mature Content appropriate to the coming of Halloween.

Credulous fools attribute this to the existence of a "bank holiday" on Monday 26th, but true initiates like ourselves know the sobering truth: the Maw has eaten one of our weekdays. We have dispatched our finest gastronauts equipped with extremely long pairs of tweezers to retrieve the missing Monday from the Maw's bowels. We can only hope it hasn't been digested yet - imagine living in a world with a four-day working week? The horror. Anyway, here are this week's PC game releases of note.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Almost a decade after his acrimonious departure from Konami, the shadow of Hideo Kojima still looms over Metal Gear Solid. He's there, barely camouflaged, in the undergrowth of Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater - a remake of the fifth Metal Gear game, originally released in 2004, which tells the tale of a lone US special operator hunting superweapons and old mentors in the jungles of the southern Soviet Union. 


I say "remake" but this feels more like a re-release, in spirit. True, it now runs on Unreal Engine, with the option of a manual, third-person perspective and cover-shooter controls in addition to the old top-down viewpoints. Yes, it boasts new flourishes, such as wounds now leaving scars, and clothes picking up stray leaves. Yes, there's a new interface with floating in-world menus, which makes shuffling between the layers a bit less awkward. It's the product of much labour, with development split between Konami and external support partner Virtuos. But where Konami's other big restoration project, Bloober's Silent Hill 2 remake, is a creative dialogue with the original game, Delta seems consumed by faithfulness to Kojima's original design.
