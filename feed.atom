        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Update: It's official!
After suffering a delay for Switch in August, it seems Victory Heat Rally might still make the finish line by 2024.
According to a listing on the Japanese eShop, racers can get ready to start their engines on 12th December 2024. Keep in mind no official announcement has been made, so until then, this is possibly subject to change.

I've been noodling with my old DS in the last week. Whether it was to celebrate its 20th anniversary, reaffirm it as my favourite system of all time, or simply help me forget that it has been two decades since I first played Nintendogs, I can't be sure. But what I do know, is that I've been having a blast.
Naturally, I went back to a handful of the classics first — there's nothing like a bit of Brain Training to get the blood pumping — but after proving that I had the mind of at least a 50-year-old (win!) and that I could no longer speed round a lap of Yoshi Falls with my eyes closed (lose!), I thought I'd make the most of the DS Lite's GBA cartridge slot and blast through some real nostalgia picks.

Of all those who started Mario & Luigi: Brothership earlier this month, fewer will have seen it through to the bitter end. Fewer still will have completed all of its side missions and unlockables and we'd wager that an even smaller number will have reached the plumbing protagonists' full potential with a pair of max levels. That's because, in the case of this final challenge, it takes flipping ages (thanks for the heads up, GamingReinvented).
Now, we've wrapped up the main game but we are far from hitting the Bros' level cap for the time being, but the good folk over at GamingReinvented appear to have done just that. What's more, they have shared some details about what goes into getting M&L to the famed Level 100.

You’ll notice that the best units here are the ones that are highly flexible or do a specific job exceptionally well. Here’s my best Horror Tower Defense tier list.


Best Horror Tower Defense Unit Tier List


Screenshot by Destructoid


I’ll rate units from S-Tier to D-Tier based on how well they deal with crowds and bosses, how flexible they are, and their stats and abilities. Note that some Rare units are exceptionally powerful starters so you’ll notice some are ranked higher than Epics or even Exclusives. Essentially, I ranked Horror Tower Defense units based on how well they fulfilled roles like boss killer DPS, AOE DPS, and starter.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The genre of 'Action RPG' is supremely annoying to write about, because the term can mean different things to different people, but here’s how I see it: Diablo 4 and similar games, such as Path Of Exile, are 'ARPGs'. Which stands for 'Action RPG'. But Zelda games are 'Action RPGs', which is a totally different genre that you could, if you felt like it, also shorten to 'ARPG'. So, to summarise: ARPGs and ARPGs are two different things, and both are Action RPGs. Got it? Great.
It’s because of this kerfuffle that I’m not exactly mad at Diablo boss Rod Ferguson recently suggesting that we just call games that are similar to Diablo 'Diablo-likes'. I just find it very funny that he’s the one saying it, in a bold faced act of admittedly very inconsequential linguistic colonialism that carries the unspoken connotation that something is "like the game I make, but a bit crap".

Nightdive Studios has released a new patch for Killing Time: Resurrected on Switch, bringing the game up to version 1.1 and adding a wealth of new features and improvements.
The highlights here include the ability to toggle low and high res weapons and actors independently of one another, the ability to burn enemies to cinders with fire attacks, and a new 'Duncan Chase' mode that can be activated by setting your player name to "DUNCAN" at the beginning. We've yet to test this out, so we can't comment on what it does, exactly, but we'll give it a whirl shortly and update this article with the details.

Here's the gist of it: I've had enough of gathering rocks and sticks to make a crafting bench, from which I'm forced to build a hut and so on. I'm sure for some this is riveting, but for me, it's something I tire of within seconds.
And so it's with a heavy heart I say that Towers Of Aghasba suffers from the same starting gamut of sticks and stones. There's a hint of some interesting ecosystem stuff springing up a bit later, and judging by the trailers, an ability to clamber on massive flying creatures made of what looks like elephant skin and hair. Still, I just can't do it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've gone on record as not being a huge fan of the artstyle choices used in the new Warcraft I & II remasters. It's crisp and readable, sure, but I'm never exactly thrilled to see all the roughness of older sprites completely done away with, especially when I always felt some of that ruggedness was the point. The tendency of remasters to treat every characterful oddity as a blemish is a wider topic than the scope of this article, but one day, Bluepoint will remaster Bloodborne, and the world will feel my pain. 
Anyway. Nowadays, I'd say Blizzard - or, World Of Warcraft, at least - is pretty much synomous with a softer, more colorful approach to fantasy worlds. While I don't pine for a return to the more boobily ridiculous elements of Frank Frazetta's style, I do often wish that some of the more expressive, pained, and physically grounded elements of classic Sword And Sorcery art was a bit more common. I'm no art scholar, and there's undoubtedly a bit of tunnel vision of my part to this assertion, but as far as as pop culture goes: I see the Blizzard version of fantasy more than I see the Frazetta version, and I don't exactly love it. Same goes for the older, punkier, less uniform sci-fi art from things like 2000 AD and Warhammer 40,000. Edwin touched on some of this in his excellent Space Marine piece. 
Anyway, a valued RPS community member on the Discord shared an older bit of art by Blizzard's Chris Metzen, from the original Starcraft manual. I figured a few of you might enjoy seeing these older pieces, considering how much the overall look of their games has changed over the years.

Nintendo has released a short animation based on The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, highlighting the game's core 'echo' mechanic in which you conjure up copies of objects to reach areas that would otherwise be inaccessible.
It certainly does the job in showcasing the gameplay, but goodness, it's just so boring. Zelda spots a chest on top of a tree, so utilises Tri to create echoes of a nearby table and crate to reach it. She succeeds, opens the chest, and grabs a red rupee.

We added new codes!




In SU, playing on private servers is the only way to play certain game modes and fully customize your experience. However, they aren't cheap, and instead of creating one, you can join a server that already exists. To do that, you'll need the Shonen Unleashed private server codes we listed right below.


Shonen Unleashed Private Server (PS) Codes List

q3n03s

Keep in mind that whoever enters a private server when it's empty gets to be the admin until the owner of the PS enters it.

Mode Mastery items are of three types - Champs, Squad Battles, and Division Rials. Out of all the rewards, only two special cards are mode exclusive (in simpler words, you'll need tokens from the specific modes).

CEO Swen Vincke did, however, caveat that while the overall level of post-release support would be "diminished", there would be a few more updates. We interpreted that to mean bug fixes and the like. Certainly, I wasn't expecting brand new subclasses for every class in the game, which is what you'll get with the just-announced Baldur's Gate 3 patch 8, together with new crossplay functionality and a full-figured photo mode.

I'm scheduling 24 advent calendar posts this week and then spending the rest of the year eating boxes of Cadbury Mini Yule Logs Triple Chocolate. So it's no surprise that Devolver have announced their remaining slate of games aiming for release in 2024 are actually coming out in 2025.

The games that slipped are Baby Steps, Skate Story, and Stick It To The Stickman. Devolver released the news with typical style, via the 15th annual Devolver Delayed awards, which you can watch below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Gray Zone Warfare initially launched, players banded together to make their own box of goodies. It was the perfect place to store unwanted materials, offering items others may have needed. The Night Ops update has evolved this concept by incorporating an official Donation Box.


Find out where to locate the Donation Box in GZW, along with details regarding the latest Backup Packages.


Gray Zone Warfare Donation Box location


The Donation Box can be found near the helipad within your faction. Look around for its 'Donations' sign, presumably under a tent. The location may vary depending on what faction you're in. If it's not by the helipad, look in other places in your base's radius. There shouldn't be too much ground to cover, as each base isn't too substantial in size.

That game began as a PICO-8 prototype by designer Jakub Wasilewski before being polished to a fine shine in its full release.

All of which is just lead-in to talking about Solitomb, a solitaire-based dungeon crawler in which you fight demons by building hands of playing cards. It's currently - heywaitaminute - a pay-what-you-want PICO-8 prototype by designer Jakub Wasilewski where "all money earned goes towards making the bigger version possible." Like Slipways, it already seems like a frightfully clever piece of design.

        <updated>2024-11-27T21:54:23.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo Switch 2 is expected to get some major new features when it is eventually released, and a new patented technology could make the handheld compatible with smartphone devices.


As originally reported by Clawsomegamer, Nintendo has filed for a new tech patent that will allow its console to work seamlessly with mobile phones. While it's hard to estimate how exactly this technology will work, it seems likely that smartphone devices could well become an external tool for the Switch 2.


Nintendo Switch 2's patented technology could be a major breakthrough


It seems that Nintendo is trying to create a central gaming ecosystem for its upcoming console. While you'll still require the handheld to play your games, the in-development technology will allow you to pair it with your smartphones and tablets.


The system is expected to work like PlayStation's QR code system. A QR code will be shown on your Nintendo Switch 2 screen, and any device you use for a scan will connect automatically to your Nintendo console.


Once connected, the possibilities are endless. The paired smartphone could act as a second controller, which would be great for having multiplayer sessions with your friends. No longer will the two of you need to own a Nintendo console, and it could be a great way for the Japanese gaming giant to advertise its products. After all, what can be better than having one of your customers show their cool Pokemon and Mario titles to their friends at a birthday party!


The scope isn't only limited to expanding Nintendo's ecosystem to devices outside its consoles. Having a tablet act as the second screen can be immensely useful, especially if you have bigger devices.


That said, it isn't clear if the technology will be immediately available in the Nintendo Switch 2. If it does, it surely is going to be a wonderful innovation on Nintendo's part.

Now there's a demo, and it's substantial with a tutorial, a 10 stage rally, and three "ever-changing Daily Stages with online Steam leaderboards."

How to fix gear in Gray Zone Warfare


The only way to repair gear in Gray Zone Warfare is by replacing it with a new one from the Vendor or mission rewards. I've tried to locate a repair kit, just like the rest of the community, but I've come up with nothing. If you took a hit from an enemy, it's best to check the item's durability to see how much longer it will last. Right-click on the equipment and select 'Inspect' to display…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Steam Autumn Sale 2024 has arrived, predictably slashing prices on countless games while giving non-Steam Deck owners a chance at one for a lower cost. It's the biggest Steam sale until the next one, which shouldn't be too far away.


Regardless, there's plenty to browse until the Winter Sale rumbles on in like an oncoming avalanche. For those who have been holding off on buying some of the top games of 2024, now's the best time to check that wishlist. Well, if you can. As expected, the Steam Store is struggling a bit today as folks log in to see what's been discounted. 


Checking my wishlist, I might finally have the excuse to pick up RoboCop: Rogue City, which has been sitting pretty on my list for about a year. It's at a whopping 60% off for the sale.




Autumn 2024 marks a new Steam Sale and Steam Award nominations


The Steam Autumn Sale 2024 starts today and rolls until December 4 at 10 am Pacific. For those who don't feel like looking at a calendar, that means you have a week to figure out if you want to grab the RPG epic Metaphor: ReFantazio at 25% off (hint: you probably do). That's about how much time you have to check out the Steam Deck, which is also on sale. You can pick up the 512GB version for 25% off.

There are plenty of other 2024 hits on sale starting today. Another Crab's Treasure is a Soulslike indie gem starring a crab trying to get his shell back — it's 34% off today. One of the year's best games is Helldivers 2 (I'm biased), nominated for four awards at The Game Awards 2024. You can learn what the buzz is about and spread some sweet liberty after picking it up for 20% off. 


Speaking of best games, starting today, you can nominate your favorite games of 2024 for the annual Steam Awards. While it might not be as loud as The Game Awards, it's at least a bit less obnoxious, with far fewer ad breaks. Check it out and vote by clicking here.

I feel like patting myself on the back, because when the Devolver Delayed Awards 2024 stream was announced, those are the games I guessed. But then I realized that I guessed them by going into Steam, looking at what games Devolver still has slated for 2024, and listing them off. There was absolutely no guesswork there, so I should probably have a little modesty.


However, I’d like to point out that Stick It to the Stickman and Skate Story are both returning champions from the Devolver Delayed 2023 stream. At this point, they might as well keep delaying them for the shower of accolades it nets them every year.


I don’t really have a horse in this race. I’m rarely disappointed by delays these days because I’ve always got too much to play, both at the present and in the future. And the only game of the three delayed I’m really all that interested in is Skate Story. That’s because I like Skate. and this game is clearly trying to do something neat with the formula. However, it’s not, like, at the top of my priorities. If it’s at the top of your priorities: bummer.


Stick It to the Stickman, Baby Steps, and Skate Story are all set to release sometime in 2025. You can check out the Devolver Delayed stream over here.

Any 10 82-rated items


Any 81-rated TOTW card



Task 3 - 83-Rated Squad



Any 10 83-rated items


Any 82-rated TOTW item



On paper, Ito is a safer choice, as Bayern has been in fantastic form. A win will secure a +2 upgrade for an item, while a draw will have +1 upgrade for both cards.

Additionally, some of these items will carry over to the multiplayer side of things (it doesn't have any in-game advantages, but it's pretty cool). Unlike most video games, you won't get the benefits straightaway. You'll have to manually travel to the locations of every chest and open them to get the items.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The FC Pro Live Challenge 3 SBC is now live in EA FC 25, and you can complete the challenge to earn a free pack in Ultimate Team. 


This is the final fodder challenge EA Sports will release as part of the ongoing Pro championships. You don't have to use any high-rated item to complete the challenge, but doing so will earn you a pack and help you wrap up the FC Pro Live Completionist objective set.


EA FC 25 FC Pro Live Challenge 3 SBC tasks


The FC Pro Live Challenge 3 SBC has one task, and here are its conditions. 


Task 1 - FC Pro Live Challenge 3 SBC



Max. 2 Players from the same League


Min. Clubs in Squad: 4


Min. 2 Players from the same Club


Min. Team Rating: 65


Min. Squad Total Chemistry Points: 14



EA FC 25 FC Pro Live Challenge 3 SBC solutions


This is one of the easiest fodder challenges, and you should have the cards that are required to complete it. However, you can always resort to buying a few items and use the solution mentioned here. 


Task 1 - FC Pro Live Challenge 3 SBC



Carty ST 59


Bellolio 61


Barry 61


Forrester CAM 66


Costelloe RM 61


Levitt CM 68


Akman 63


Hughes CB 70


Gannon CB 62


Brady RB 67


Vega 60



After completing the challenge, you'll get a Small Prime Mixed Players Pak. This pack isn't that good, and you get 2 Silver, 2 Bronze, and 2 Gold Player items. Any three of the six cards will be Rare, so the potential outcome ain't great. That said, the cost of completing this SBC is extremely low, and you can get the bonus rewards from the Completionist objective. Hence, make sure to complete the challenge as quickly as possible so as not to miss out on any potential packs ahead of Black Friday.

This free evolution is a perfect choice for your TOTW item, as the card can be boosted with better stats and new playstyles. Let's take a look at the requirements of this evolution to find out which cards can be used. 


EA FC 25 TOTW Surge evolution requirements


Here are the requirements for the TOTW Surge evolution in EA FC 25.



Rarity Team of the Week


Overall Max. 86


Max PS 8


Max PS+ 1

Best players to use in EA FC 25 TOTW Surge evolution


Here are some of the best cards to consider for this evolution. However, it's better to go with the TOTW item that you might already be having in your club. 



Denzel Dumfries 86


Freigang 86

These are some of the best items to consider for this evolution, and you won’t even need to combine the cards with other upgrades.

If you want to use any of the evolved items in a SBC, it won't count as a TOTW card.

Still, dear readers, if you feel like punishing us for that comment system switch, you could always head over to Amazon and buy up all the stock yourself.
$590 is a decent deal for a model that’s spent most of the past few months at $610, but us Brits are getting the better bargain here - even if it’s not for the OC version. £500 means a hefty £49 slasheroo, the deepest discount this card has seen yet, and you’ll also get a key for Indiana Jones and the Great Circle to play when it releases on December 9th.

So... where is it?
When Metroid Prime Remastered launched on 9th February 2023, we were utterly convinced that its sequels, Prime 2: Echoes and Prime 3: Corruption, would follow suit sometime after. Now that 2025 is fast approaching, our certainty has waned, yet we remain confident that Nintendo will complete the saga on Switch before Metroid Prime 4: Beyond launches. The question, however, is when.

As of this writing, 2K has yet to reveal the rewards that will be part of the new season. However, we have confirmation about when the new season will kick off. The date and time were confirmed when the patch notes for Update 3.0 were revealed.


NBA 2K25 Season 3 release date


Season 3 is going live on Friday, November 29. In other words, players have only a few more days to complete the current season pass and unlock all the rewards. If you go for a pro upgrade, you can unlock far more rewards in the process. Once the new season goes live, a fresh season pass will be available for all.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's often claimed by liars and fools that our website's title is a clever reference to the ancient Chinese game of shoushiling - or "rock paper scissors", as it's known overseas. The orthodox interpretation is that "Rock Paper Shotgun" is a folksy regional variation on this, with a "shotgun" instead of the "scissors". But friends, this is patently absurd. Think about it: a game that pits a shotgun against a rock or piece of paper would be incredibly one-sided. It goes against reason!
The sad reality is that the origins of our website's title have been deliberately obscured, allowing cold hard fact to slither back into legend. Behind that mockingly nonsensical moniker sleeps an eldritch truth of such gravity it would make Gandalf spill his mead. Friends, the Rock Paper Shotgun is real. The Weapon exists. Or at least, it once did - and will, for I mean to fashion it anew by combing the writing of RPS writers gone by for raw materials. And in this endeavour, I will naturally need your aid.

The new feature promises a refreshing take on the game, along with a Night Ops Launch trailer that gives us a sneak peek.


The latest trailer vividly captures the danger that lurks in the night, with visuals shrouded in darkness. I've experienced this firsthand in-game, and I can tell you, it's an intense experience. The realism is so palpable that I've often found myself wandering aimlessly, only to be jump scared by an enemy. It's terrifying, but at least it keeps up with Gray Zone Warfare's realism aspect.

If the likes of chairs, glasses, and chewing gum can be painted stealth-bomber black and prefixed with the G word, why not something that can actually get off its harshly angled bum and help pipe the games themselves into your head?
Then again, maybe gaming earbuds were just waiting for their moment. Obviously the Nintendo Switch is the Nintendo Switch, but the rise of handhelds like the Steam Deck and Asus ROG Ally has driven desires for more portable (yet games-friendly) noise-deliverers 'round these PC parts as well. Thus, for another edition of Should You Bother With – the RPS column where a diaphragm of testing vibrates advice directly into the cochlea of understanding – let’s have a listen of these wireless buds and find out whether they’re a worthy replacement for your current go-to headphones.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Popular indie games Palworld and Terraria will have some crossover content next year in Palworld. Very few details have been shared about the tie-in, but we know information will be coming soon.


Palworld Terraria crossover is incoming


Viewed over 1.8 million times on X since the Tuesday announcement, the official Palworld social media account posted a crossover image. It has the Terraria Guy and Palworld's main character shaking hands. Not much else is known other than we're getting information "coming soon." 


Palworld also says that there will be at least one more update before the end of the year. This time, it says news about the next update will be coming "very soon." 




Terraria is no stranger to crossovers. Don't Starve Together has the Eye of Terror, new bosses, and a bunch of new skins inspired by Terraria, while Terraria received one new boss and plenty of items based on the Klei property. Terraria also received Stardew Valley-based content, such as the Blue Chicken and Stardrop, while Stardew Valley implemented the Meowmere sword. 


Based on past history, it's likely we'll see Terraria elements in Palworld, and vice versa. Based on the art, we could see Cattiva, Depresso, and Chillet in the world of Terraria. On the other hand, perhaps some weapons and crafting items could be craftable in Palworld. 


Image via Pocketpair


This is the first good news for Palworld fans for a while. The game's developer, Pocketpair, has been sued by The Pokémon Company. The plaintiff claims that Pocketpair has infringed on three patents. It's been reported that the Pal Sphere system veers too close to a Pokéball.

The Night Ops update expands this aspect through its new Night and Day cycle, bringing a unique threat in the darkness.


The dangers of the night forces you to use various light materials, specifically with the latest NVG equipment. Here's how to get Night Vision Goggles in Gray Zone Warfare.


How to unlock NVGs in Gray Zone Warfare


Gray Zone Warfare Night Ops offers three versatile night vision device options: PVS-7, PVS-14, and PVS 31A. The vendor, Handshake, sells the PVS-7 for $5,218, which makes for an excellent starter NVG. With its green phosphor, this single-tube night vision binocular empowers you to see through the darkness with ease.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Y'all got no taste, or what?
When we check out the latest UK Charts data each week, we generally have a pretty good idea of where some of the newest titles will end up placing. Granted, Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake was a little lower than our estimates when it debuted in 14th place last week, but when we scrolled through this week's list and found it had disappeared entirely, well, we frankly couldn't believe it.
Alas, it's true. The exceptional RPG remake from Square Enix has crashed out of the top 40 altogether, marking a stark difference between audiences' tastes in the UK when compared to Japan. We knew it would never do gangbusters, of course – Dragon Quest never really does well in the UK – but goodness, this is absurd. At least its performance over in Japan will likely be enough to keep Squeenix satisfied for now.

But hiding in the patch notes is an apology of sorts, a nod to that most tenacious of bunnyhopper: the Half-Life 2 speedrunner. It seems the recent 20th anniversary update for the classic first-person shooter messed with some beginner speedrun strategies by introducing an invisible wall to a big sewer pipe. Valve have now corrected that, removing the offending blocker and restoring order to the universe. Well, almost.

In short, this Arcade Archives release will be adding to one heck of a collection.

Here's a creepy good 'un: "'Please, God, don't let it look in the closet,’ I silently prayed. 'Please, God, don't let it look in the closet,' it parroted back from the next room." You can't do that with baby shoes, you anonymous hack!
Silent Hill 2 remake’s senior narrative designer Barbara Kciuk reckons this principle extends to much bigger productions. "It is a bit niche, but actually, the interesting part about horror is that it is one of the best ratios when it comes to the cost of production and the earnings," she recently told TheGamer’s Rhiannon Bevan.

Back in September, Koei Tecmo announced another Atelier game for Switch. We still don't have a precise release date for the catchily-titled (deep breath) Atelier Resleriana: The Red Alchemist & the White Guardian, but we do know that it'll be launching at some point in 2025. Other details are slim, but Koei Tecmo has shed a little more light on the upcoming project in a recent tweet.
Let's get the biggie out of the way first: Atelier Resleriana will not include a gacha system. The game's mobile predecessor, Atelier Resleriana: Forgotten Alchemy and the Polar Night Liberator, was guilty of relying perhaps a little too heavily on pull rates and paid-only options, so it's nice to hear that we'll see no such systems in the console spin-off.

Given the sheer magnitude of Animal Crossing's popularity (New Horizons is currently sitting pretty at 46.45 million units sold on Switch), it's no surprise that other companies will want to take a peek at Nintendo's homework and conjure up something similar.
The latest effort is seemingly cooking away within the walls of Ubisoft, as a new report from Insider Gaming suggests that the company is hard at work on a new social-sim project by the codename of 'Alterra'. It's said to be inspired by Animal Crossing while utilising a voxel-based visual setup (think The Touryst and you'll be on the right track).

The My Nintendo loyalty program is pretty good, right? If you head on over to the rewards section of the service right now, you’ll find a host of interesting goodies to claim should you possess the required number of coins. These include a Nintendo Switch Online 2025 Calendar, a set of Super Mario Bros. embossed art prints, a Mario vs. Donkey Kong smartphone ring, and a Mario & Luigi: Brothership pin set. That’s… good, isn’t it?
Yes, it’s good, but it’s not great. And by gum, if you’ve been a fan of Nintendo for a while now, then you’ll know that My Nintendo’s predecessor, Club Nintendo, was often great. In operation from 2002 (region-depending) until 2015, Club Nintendo offered up some of the most incredible, one-of-a-kind products imaginable. A golden Twilight Princess statue, a SNES controller for the Wii, a Year of Luigi coin, multiple CD soundtracks... It really felt like the sky was the limit for Club Nintendo, and we’re saddened that My Nintendo will likely never match its brilliance.

Which is a shame, as it’s a very, very good gamepad, including for PC playage. Consider these Black Friday week deals, then, as a rare opportunity to secure yourself said good gamepad without acquiescing to Sony’s stubbornness: it’s down to £40 in the UK and $54 in the US.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you're playing a "PS1-style" game these days, odds are it's a horror game. Sometimes, I worry that the association of PS1 with moody, Silent Hillian dankness has gotten to the point that younger players no longer perceive the original PS1 as a video game console at all. Going by Itch.io's Halloween output, the PS1 was just a rusty bucket of rot and gore in which the faithful might periodically hallucinate the face of Spyro the Dragon.
Here to remind us that the PS1 was capable of colours beside "existential grey" is Water Level/b.l.u.e. EXPLORATION, from New York City-based game designer Hatim Benhsain. It's a free downloadable experiment inspired by b.l.u.e.: Legend of Water, a Japan-only PS1 adventure in which you are a girl swimming through alien ruins with her dolphin.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Video games in general have a surplus of weapons. It's gotten to the point that if I had any freelance budget, I'd commission somebody to count them up. Just give me an approximate running total for the industry at large, so that whenever next a shiny-eyed producer regales me with the prospect of enchanted lazurite rapiers at a preview event, I can quietly ask how many enchanted lazurite rapiers we're talking about, then open my laptop and generate a scrolling image akin to those comparison pages for stars and planets - a cosmic mountain of points and pommels, with the new game's armoury forming a pixel-wide foothill in the bottom left corner. "Are there not enough enchanted lazurite rapiers," I will kindly enquire, as the producer sobs brokenly into my shoulder.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sometimes a home only becomes a home when you leave. I recently moved out from a London flat I'd rented for over a decade, for instance, and this has properly done a number on me. Being given my notice transformed the place from a transient pile of cadaverous lino and spasmodic plumbing into something mythical and unnerving – a whole chapter of my life completed and reduced to a piece of masonry in the rearview mirror, a relic I had been living in for years without quite realising.
A few video game developers have investigated emotions like these by recreating their current and prior homes as virtual environments: places of mingled memory and invention, expressive of both nostalgia and surprise. At this year's Game Developer Conference in San Francisco, I interviewed a couple of teams who are coming at this premise with very different objectives, and somehow, meeting in the middle. One of the games in question is a work of daydreaming fondness, the other of comical anger. Both find a focus in the figure of a matriarch who is kindly in one game, abusive in the other.

When did its non-descript, black hooded protagonist first wriggle, with the transgressive delight of an unbidden slug between naked toes embarking on a 2am fridge odyssey, into the as yet uncolonised crevices of my ‘demos’ library? The specifics, I fear, are but the fumes of memories, lingering like armies of mice in trenchcoats at supermarket cheese sample platters, at once painfully obvious and immune to detection in their uncanny shroud of stifling human decorum. "For who is madder?!" I shout, in a normal and cool manner. "The mice - so very mad for cheese - or the madmen who screams ‘Mice! Mice!’ in the middle of the cheese aisle?!"
And if I can’t remember how it got here, how can I make it go away?

Down is where much of the Badness in the world is traditionally located, after all, whether you're talking about geology or psychology or theology. White Knuckle reverses the flow. You are already Down; by extrapolation, you must now go Up.
Possibly, you are Down because you are a manifestation of the aforementioned Badness. Possibly, the monstrous things trying to thwart your ascent are merely trying to stop you contaminating the surface world. Possibly, they are the Real Heroes. It doesn't really matter, because you don't have a choice. There is a wall of unspeakable flesh coming up the tunnel behind you. To avoid becoming part of it, you must climb.

"I won’t", I reply in sing-song while quietly adding pictures of the JSAUX ModCase to the CMS. That’s right, Amazon and a bunch of other retails have launched their BF sales a week early, which is annoying, unless you’re in the market for a Steam Deck case upgrade. If so, consider the compact, multifunctional ModCase, which is down to just £24 / $24. That makes for savings of 33% and 20% respectively, on what was already a nicely affordable alternative to the luxury of Dbrand’s similar Project Killswitch.

Far from being a premeditated ambush by intelligent AI-controlled soldiers, this is just a result of the game's janky spawns. Those botched encounters are unlike previous games, where roaming bands of factional murderfolk would patrol the radioactive wastes, seemingly according to their own whims. Back in the day, this wandering baddies feature was dubbed "A-life" by developers GSC Game World - basically a jargon word for the simulation of enemies that would lead to "emergent" moments of violence and conflict. It was promised as a feature in Stalker 2 but many players have noticed it seems to be absent. Over the weekend, GSC insisted the simulation is technically present in the sequel. It's just broken.

Even if it’s you’re first time hearing his name, you’ll be familiar with his fingerprints on some of the setting’s most defining artwork. He’s responsible for that iconic imagine of the emprah - the one the best shows off the dark irony of a such a wretched figure becoming an idol of worship. While the term ‘grimdark’ originates from 40k’s "in the grim darkness of the far future…" tagline, grimdark as an aesthetic is one Blanche pioneered. There’s even a style of miniature painting - Blanchitsu - named after him.
Basically, even games that don’t use the 40k license owe an incredible amount to Blanche’s work. That’s not to mention his influence on the fantasy setting of the Total War: Warhammer series either. His piece Harry The Hammer was the cover for the first edition of Fantasy Battle - recently added to the strategy game as chaos hero Harold Hammerstorm. I could go on, and I might do so in a bit, but here’s the news: Trademark Films are making a documentary on Blanche’s work, starring Napoleon Dynamite actor Jon Heder. It’s called The Grim And The Dark: The Search For John Blanche, and it’s out next Spring. Here’s a trailer:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We've been working for a while on the next ScummVM release, and it is time for a call for public testing.
Support for a number of new engines and games for the existing ones was added, and we need your special attention to the following titles:
Orion Burger.
Total Eclipse and Total Eclipse 2.
Thimbleweed Park.
The Space Bar.
Moonbase Commander. (with multiplayer support)
Backyard Basketball.
Unrest.
Rise of the Dragon.
Castle Master.
Wait for it! Issue 3. Song for a Hare. (Ну, погоди! Выпуск 3. Песня для зайца)
Mask Show. (Маски-шоу)
Marvellous Mice Adventures: Meeting Sea Rat. (Три маленькие белые мышки. Визит Морской крысы)
The Adventures of the Good Soldier Schweik. (Похождения бравого солдата Швейка)
Marvellous Mice Adventures: Sea Rat's Birthday. (Три маленькие белые мышки. День рождения морской крысы)
Besides these newly supported games, almost half of the current 108 engines have notable changes. Thus, testing more games is always a good thing.
All testing must be done with stable builds, not development ones. Please report bugs or oddities on our issue tracker.
A detailed list of all exciting new features and fixes is available in our NEWS file.
We are looking forward to your reports about successful and unsuccessful playthroughs and bugs reported!

Determined to right this most heinous of wrongs, and armed with the conviction that no subjectivity be allowed to exist on the internet without at least one supplementary article of caveats, we’ve all put forth a single game that absolutely should have made the list. Consider the matter closed, then, at least until we all realise we’d actually like to do a 102nd pick each.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Helldivers 2 developers Arrowhead have been voluble lately about potentially adding elements from other sci-fi worlds to the shooter, with chief creative officer Johan Pilestedt rubbing his hands gleefully at the prospect of partnerships with Warhammer, Alien, the Fifth Element, and more besides. Speaking at the G-STAR Conference in Busan earlier this month, recently appointed chief executive officer Shams Jorjani confirmed that Arrowhead are looking into such collaborations, giving the example of refitting your dropship to look like one of Halo's Pelicans, or introducing the Zerg from Blizzard's Starcraft as an enemy faction. 
Jorjani cautioned listeners, however, that these injections of third-party DNA need to look and feel appropriate to the setting. After all, if you start fecklessly chucking the Zerg, Chaos Space Marines or Fifth Element's, er, flying taxis into Helldivers 2, it might spoil the meticulous coherency of a game in which saluting protects you against lethal falls and some guy called Joel is running the universe. The funny part is that according to Jorjani, Arrowhead once envisaged a system that would get round the problem of inconsistency by essentially making third-party cosmetics, including whole map skins, visible only to players who have them enabled. To put that another way, Arrowhead once envisaged a system in which individual Helldivers would hallucinate other licenses.

It can take entire clips of ammo to take down some of these tough beasts, and you get nothing back for killing this wildlife except the hollow satisfaction of pest control. Alongside the bugs and performance issues, it's a common enough complaint to players of the first-person survival shooter that it's already been addressed by a modder, who has created a tweak to lower the health of various dogs, boars, and bloodsuckers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Long before Hideo Kojima made the first triple-A walking simulator, he was trying to spin sunlight into bullets. The game in question, Boktai: The Sun Is In Your Hand, is a Game Boy Advance title from 2003, in which you play a vampire-slaying gunslinger. The gun you're slinging is a "solar-powered" pistol, which you could charge up using a cartridge-mounted photometric sensor by physically standing in sunshine. This was 13 years before the launch of Pokemon Go. Sadly, Boktai's debut didn't result in city parks or rooftops being flooded by crowds of GBA-wielding undead killers. But it was a fun gimmick and the game itself is good enough to carry it - an isometric dungeon-crawler in which you have to find a vamp's coffin and drag it to the surface for purgation.

This upsets me slightly, because I find Rockstar’s constant self-assured bloviating to be quite irritating, even though I’m sure I’ll play their game for a billion hours. What Vivat Slovakia is, then, is a very ambitious homage to the Grand Theft Auto series that isn’t shy about it, right down to the font choices. I’m not sure if you should play it, but I do feel enriched for learning of its existence. Here’s a trailer.

It tells me exactly what I need to do before I even boot up the game, which is otherwise powerfully weird-looking. The cover art is reminiscent of a children's book, if it were for adults. Or a lost episode of Ed Edd and Eddy, where a fourth older sibling (Eddie) acts on his murderous intent and engages in some slick FPSing. Either way, there's a demo out on Steam and despite being very short and limited, I am excited for its future.

Gone is the companion eagle who can spot enemies for you, for a start; instead, players can hide in the - hey - shadows, lie on their tummies for the first time, and make use of a "shinobi and assassin arsenal" of smoke bombs and bells.

There are old moves that are coming back after an absence, too: Shadows will allow for 'double assassinations' again.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Star Wars Outlaws' stealth has been much debated, though not hotly. Some people think it's rubbish, some others think it's basically fine. Ubisoft themselves seem to think it's one of the key issues with the game, with the creative director previously saying the forced stealth sections are "incredibly punishing".

Now there's a new patch, apparently Outlaws' biggest yet, and stealth and combat are firmly in the crosshairs. The AI and player detection has changed; you can now choose combat in areas where it was previously not allowed; and enemies have had weak points added, for those who wish to cause massive damage.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl stays largely faithful to the original series’ bleak yet inquisitive tone and propensity for technical problems, but there’s another, much smaller feature that it also brings back: silly titles for its lesser NPCs. All the major and side characters are, indeed, characters, but rather than leave inconsequential henchmen and roving bandits nameless, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 assigns Zone-merc handles to each and every one of them. Some try to sound badass, some might as well have been chosen by the owner panickedly looking around the room for something to name himself after, and all of them sound like they should be on the actor's wall in Toast of London.
Because your life partly depends on relieving slain foes of their belongings, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 encourages you to get up close and looty with these blokes, meaning you end up spending a lot of time reading goofy nicknames. I thought I’d pay tribute to the best ones I’ve seen so far, even if the majority of these honours will need to be given posthumously.

That makes my usual new-game performance analysis/settings guide song and dance harder to pull off, with or without the appropriate soundtrack. Is S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 in such dire technical straits that we should wait for a few patches before giving it a shake? And how can its best settings be anointed if some, particularly FSR 3 frame generation, simply don’t work as they should?

It casts you as one of several jellybaby pugilists, fighting for dominance over such locations as Ferris wheels and the tops of speeding vans. All of the characters are 1) seemingly drunk, and 2) subject to real-time physics. Your abilities consist of 1) punching, headbutting or kicking people, perhaps knocking them out for a few seconds, and 2) grabbing people and things and either hoisting them skyward like a wrestler, or hoisting yourself skyward like a toddler climbing onto Mummy's head. The only way of defeating people is to hurl them off-map.

Yes, the subtitle involves both a colon and a dad joke, but the demo is entertaining - Nuclear Throne meets Ctrl Alt Ego, in short. The one major criticism I have after 20 minutes or so is that the flat pixelart perspective makes walls and walkable surfaces look interchangeable, and this feels more like a question of acclimatisation than a real complaint.

The challenge was to develop a solution to prevent non-approved 'pirate' set-top devices from functioning in people's homes. The team say they were able to remotely transfer code which completely disabled a target device. Once implemented, "there will be a general failure in most of the irregular boxes in use," the hacker predicted.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In 2015 a flight by Germanwings carrying 144 passengers and six crew crashed into a mountain in the French Alps. Later, the authorities who investigated the crash judged it was intentional - somebody in the cockpit had purposefully crashed the plane in an act of suicide, killing themselves and everyone on board. Mouthwashing begins with the same premise, albeit in a sci-fi setting. You're piloting a spaceship with a crew of five, clicking on its various controls to override the safety and turn the ship towards a nearby heap of space rock. You mean to crash. The words that appear moments before this sequence are chilling in their simplicity: "I hope this hurts."

The studio is owned by Bandai Namco and released the game about a month ago. The exact number of people out of work isn't known, as Reflector haven't made a public statement about it. (Update: A statement from Reflector says the layoffs amount to 18% of the total workforce). Among those affected are folks working in art, design, UI, lighting, and narrative.

Indications that Brazil is already testing piracy blocking measures at the internet's core routers is controversial, but if blocking is accurate and only targets pirate sites, criticism may be limited. With a new 250+ domain blocking wave implemented this week, let's take a closer look at how things play out.

Wasn't the first game an action-RPG? True, it was a third-person shooter, but it also had a progression system with unlockable abilities and boosts. Besides, isn't every action game an action-RPG these days? Levelling-up has become an industry-wide syndrome. Go on, name an action game that doesn't have RPG-style elements. No wait, don't actually do that. I was being rhetorical. Read the rest of this post first.

Ultimately, I gave Threshold chance after chance because I was totally taken by my shift and my immense desire to find out just what I was actually doing. Anyway, it's time for me to clock off! I urge you to take over until I'm back. It's worth it.

We've got a review in the works, but code has landed late, so our write-up might take a while. In the shorter term, I thought you might like to know how, exactly, MFS 2024 makes use of "machine learning" technologies, taking into account the energy cost of such wacky gadgetry and the creeping relationship between increased reliance on automated tools and laying people off. More immediately, you might like to know how much of your internet package it'll devour as you play.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am a very casual enjoyer of Metal Slug games. I've never actually paid for one of these side-scrolling shoot 'em ups, except for all the countless coins I happily pumped into arcade machines as a child. To this day, if I see a rare glittering cabinet running one of these crunchy shmups, I will go ham for twenty or thirty minutes, and walk away satisfied that I have seen a lot of very good pixels. These games, I am convinced, were never really designed to be completed, but to be played exactly like this, as a coin-gobbling invitation to become a bandana-wearing sisyphus, a tiny Rambo pushing a bouncy, juddering tank up a hill occupied by cartoon nazis. You die a bunch and say: "ah, that was good."
So what happens when you rearrange the molecules of this run and/or gun 'em up into an isometric turn-based strategy game? You get Metal Slug Tactics, an off-kilter nod to Into The Breach and other grid-based turn-takers, but secretly housing the aggressive notions of an unhinged pyromaniac. You still die a lot. And you still walk away feeling fairly happy about it.

It's like the "glass half empty" mindset, but the bartender hasn't even taken your order and this might not even be a bar. Odds are you've wandered into the local antique shop. Well I, friends, am that bellyacher. Here I stand at the "bar", gesticulating wildly over my non-existent glass.
In this scenario, the confused bartender/antique shop owner is Turtle Rock, developers of Left 4 Dead homage Back 4 Blood. Rumour has it that they're making a Back 4 Blood 2 - but as I loudly explain to the bartender/antique shop owner, showering the cocktail measures/vintage Toby Jugs in spittle, I don't want a Back 4 Blood 2. I want a follow-up to 2015's Evolve, in which four hunters team up to track down a fifth person playing as a kaiju. "A flagon of your finest Gorgon, please," I roar, thumping the bar, while Turtle Rock tries to sell me a gentleman's travelling suitcase from the 1920s.

I hope one day to level up from "bumbling, tumbling and blundering" to "running and jumping". Perhaps I'll even get as far as "speedrunning". But in the likely event that I plateau at "blundering", it's a relief to know that developer Rubeki Games has updated the game with an Explore Mode that makes certain sections dramatically easier.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been trying to work out if I'm keen on Soulframe only because I feel guilty about missing the boat with Warframe. I reviewed Digital Extremes' hit free-to-play shooter in 2013, back when people were still calling it a spiritual successor to the developer's boomerang-throwing action game Dark Sector. I didn't like Warframe much at the time. Think I gave it a 6/10. Warp forward a decade, and that 6/10 game has become a thriving live service phenomenon - fifteenth on the Steam Most Played charts at the time of writing, and profitable enough to spawn its own annual TennoCon expo. It's also become an intoxicating, confusing morass of dynastic sci-fantasy politicking and genre-shifting expansions, ranging from capital ship mechanics to questions of time travel, wrapped in layers of cosmetics that make Destiny look about as colourful as Gears Of War. 


I definitely didn't see all that coming. I doubt Digital Extremes saw it coming either. Warframe today feels like a lab experiment run amok. I love its appetite for novelty, but there's a lot for a returning player to catch up on and, frankly, it feels like homework. As such, I had a couple of broad motivations for playing Soulframe's pre-alpha "prelude": I'm keen to see what Digital Extremes can do when they aren't encumbered by 10 years of world-building, and I want to get in on the ground floor before they absolutely swamp this thing in updates.

Valve's given the fairly nondescript trainyard a "full visual overhaul" in Counter-Strike 2, making it "60% cloudier" and changing its layout to encourage more tactical play besides just whipping out the AWP and looking down long, narrow corridors.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A senator for the US government has urged Valve to answer complaints about the amount of racist, sexist and otherwise hateful posts and imagery shared by users on Steam. The digital store was the subject of a report by the Anti-Defamation League last week, which claimed to find millions of examples of "hateful or extremist" language and images hosted on Steam's community. These include things like Nazi symbols in profile pictures, white supremacist slogans in group names, and yet more discriminatory spew in user posts. The senator has noticed this report, and now writes directly to Gabe Newell, demanding that Valve "bring its content moderation practices in line with industry standards" or risk "intense scrutiny" from the government.

True, games like Invisigun have experimented with this interesting concept before, but in Assassinvisible it's framed by another - the whole game exists as doodles in a bored student’s notebook.

Debutující scenárista a režisér Vojtěch Strakatý nám přináší drama děvčete, které netuší, co si počít.


Existuje vícero českých filmů, které surfují na oblíbené vlně "zakažte exekutory, zrušte dluhy, je to nelidské!" (například Tancuj Matyldo). After Party takovým filmem není. Exekutoři se v něm chovají korektně a slušně a vinu na situaci celé rodiny nese naprosto jednoznačně otec, který neopatrně investoval, i když nevíme jak. A "nevíme jak" je téma, prolínající se celým tímto filmem. Takže nevíme, co vlastně otec komu naslibova…]]></summary>

This is surely the best link this week: an hour-long video on how to beat "every possible game of Pokemon Platinum at the same time". That is, coming up with a set of game inputs that can win billions of possible permutations of the game, as determined by its RNG, when played simultaneously. It's an impressive feat, but the video itself is great too, patiently breaking down the process with motion graphics and video editing flair. Delightful.

There I was, just starting to get to grips with the card-house-careful balance between each of its units when, bam, makers Game River dropped a Jenga block on top of it. It’s a stealth block, too. Didn’t even see it coming.
Update 1.1’s new unit is the Phantom Ray, which Game River describe as "a medium-sized aircraft with high HP that excels at striking enemies at close range with high-damage missiles". It’s a mid-tier flier, costing 50 to unlock and 200 to field, and for that you get three of them per unit. As for default tech, you’ve got some range and fire rate unlocks, alongside an oil drop. The headliner here is the stealth buff, which cloaks the Phantom Ray by default until it attacks. When it does, it all gets a nice 40% bonus to damage.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sorry We're Closed is a retro survival horror-inspired game about escaping the clutches of an excessively horny demon who desperately wants your heart. As someone who isn't often into the 'lore' behind things and prefers to just shoot and ask questions later, I found myself actually asking the questions. I wanted to know why I was targeted by such carnal eroticism. I wanted to know more about my character's own relationships. How angels fit into the picture. And why lots of the demons seem quite chill, really.
But when it came to the actual survival -  the bit I thought I'd enjoy the most -  I came away a bit disappointed. Exploration is fine, it's just the combat is often too frequent and too frequently irritating. I came to dread the action more than the atmosphere, in the end.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In Rue Valley you role play a guy with poor mental health. He wanders around a crappy motel, stuck in the same old patterns of life, seemingly unable to escape his inner demons. When confronted with the premise for this upcoming RPG you may have one of two reactions. The first: you will say "lol, it me" with enough humour to wishlist it on Steam and earmark it for the future. The second: you will mutter "ugh, it me" and be immediately put off by the idea of having to tolerate an entire second layer of psychological hangups. 
There is a third secret reaction though... you might think: oh, this looks a lot like Disco Elysium, but in the real world.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve said it before, I’ll say it again: running away is the best feeling in videogames. More specifically, being chased is the best feeling in videogames, a sentiment I’d happen to share with my golden retriever if you replaced the word “videogames” with “the universe”. He is a purer being, but he’ll also never know the joy of executing a rail-dismount into a dashing corner-jump escape in Deadlock, and for this he deserves our pity.

It’s easy to miss if you haven’t played for at least a few hours, but Deadlock packs one of the most engaging movement systems this side of Tribes Ascend.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The gaming keyboard market is currently tripping over itself, trying to equip everything with the technology most commonly known as Snap Tap: a feature that promises hyperfast inputs of two alternating keypresses, making you an unkillable side-strafing blur in your FPS of choice. Introduced on Razer’s Huntsman V3 Pro series and quickly followed by Wooting’s (functionally distinct but effectively identical) Rappy Snappy, Snap Tap is now wearing multiple names as it takes over the world of RGB peripherals, from SteelSeries’ Rapid Tap to Corsair’s FlashTap and Keychron’s... Last Keystroke Prioritisation. Which doesn’t sound as sexy, but still.
However, Snap Tap is also drawing a level of ire that exceeds the usual baseline scepticism of hardware marketing. Because it enables a form of input automation – where you can quickly move in two directions by rapidly tapping one key, while holding down another – it’s considered by some as tantamount to cheating, allowing players to cross the line that divides unfair play from the accepted comforts that come with simply using a responsive Hall Effect keyboard or high-refresh-rate monitor. It’s even become a bannable offence in certain games, most notably in Counter-Strike 2.
Neither side is backing down; in an astonishingly worded tweet, Wooting went as far as to concede Snap Tap "should be considered cheating. But if it’s allowed, you need it." But do you?

They've also given the same permission for Unreal Tournament to be hosted there too, making free the multiplayer muckabout that spawned speedier and speedier sequels throughout the early 2000s (not to mention the origin of one of the most memorable multiplayer FPS maps of all time, Facing Worlds).

After artwork leaked last week for what looked very much like a remaster of classic real-time strategy Warcraft II: Tides Of Darkness, Blizzard sneakily dropped both that and a remaster of Warcraft: Orcs & Humans last night. They’re bundled together with Warcraft III: Reforged - itself with a new patch - in a 'Warcraft Remastered Battle Chest', which also includes the older versions of the first two games. The chest is available on Battle.net, where it’ll set you back £34.99 / $39.99. If you’re just after the older titles, they’re £9 / $10 and £12.59 / $15 respectively.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over the years, game retailers GOG have drifted from almost purely offering classic oldies to welcoming more and more modern blockbusters onto their storefront. In one sense, they've turned from a game preservation champion into a slightly dustier, DRM-less Steam. Now, though, GOG have declared a renewed focus on not just selling aged games, but on tweaking more of them to work on non-aged hardware. And you'll be able to tell which games have got this restoration treatment from a fancy badge plastered on top of them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Castle Master, the haunting conclusion to the Freescape engine saga, is now ready for public testing!
Prepare yourself for a perilous adventure as you lower the drawbridge to enter the Castle Master’s domain. Released in 1990 by Incentive Software, Castle Master became popular for its technical innovation and challenging gameplay. The game inspired countless 3D adventure titles, and the Freescape engine itself marked a technological milestone, enabling groundbreaking object interaction and spatial puzzles.
Notably, Castle Master was one of the first games to let you choose to play as either a prince or a princess, offering a different experience depending on your choice.
Your mission: rescue your twin, imprisoned within the eerie depths of Castle Eternity by the evil Magister. This sprawling, foreboding castle is filled with traps, monsters, and puzzles blocking your path. Gather items, unlock doors, and solve complex riddles as you navigate the labyrinthine halls and confront the dark forces within.
This modern reimplementation showcases enhanced graphics using OpenGL, with initial support for the DOS and ZX Spectrum releases. If you’re eager to embark on this dark journey, a playable demo is available to test your tenacity.
To participate in the testing, ensure you have a daily development build. We encourage all players to submit feedback and bug reports through our issue tracker.
Will you brave the creepy corridors of Castle Eternity and free your sibling, or will you fall victim to the Magister’s curse and join his army of enslaved spirits? The adventure awaits!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nevím, co je "legálně" zapotřebí k tomu, aby se mohl film nazývat "dokumentem", ale tohle působí jako zcela standardní nízkorozpočtový hraný film. Je to hořká komedie, která těží z atmosféry jednotlivých scén (velmi rozvláčných), aniž by měla jakýkoliv podstatný děj, směřující k nějakým pointám. (Ilča 40 %)]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dokument, který je profesionálně natočen, tzn. má tempo a atmosféru, je přehledný a dobře se na něj dívá. Co je to ale platné, když film zcela selhává v tom hlavním, tzn. v tom, aby nám nastínil, co se vlastně tehdy tomu děvčeti stalo a proč bychom se o to měli zajímat. Je nadhozeno několik navzájem si odporujících teorií (z nichž žádná není nijak překvapivá), nic se neprokáže, nic se neodhalí, a je konec. (Ilča 30 %)]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After seven months of intense work, we are ready to announce support for a few games based on qdEngine, developed by K-D Labs.
The work is based on the original sources published now under GPL, although the work started a bit earlier than that. The engine supports 14 games, five of which we are announcing support for. Most of these games were released in Russian; however, there were Lithuanian, Czech, and Polish releases. The support is announced for:
Wait for it! Issue 3. Song for a Hare, (Russian: Ну, погоди! Выпуск 3. Песня для зайца, Lithuanian: Na, palauk! Zuikio dainos, Czech: Jen počkej a Píseň pro zajíce)
Mask Show (Russian: Маски-шоу)
Marvellous Mice Adventures: Meeting Sea Rat (Russian: Три маленькие белые мышки. Визит Морской крысы, Czech: Příběhy myší rodinky I, Polish: Były Sobie Myszki Trzy: Na Spotkanie Cioci Myszy)
The Adventures of the Good Soldier Schweik (Russian: Похождения бравого солдата Швейка)
Marvellous Mice Adventures: Sea Rat's Birthday, (Russian: Три маленькие белые мышки. День рождения морской крысы, Polish: Były Sobie Myszki Trzy: Urodzinowe Śledztwo)
Other games do work; however, we haven’t playtested them. You may find more information on our Wiki. Also, we are looking for the Lithuanian version of Little Longnose and Polish releases of Little Mice games and Wait for it! game. If you happen to have a copy, please contact sev.
We continue the active development so that support for other games will follow shortly. The primary constraint is playtesting.
To run these games, you need the latest daily build of ScummVM. If you encounter any hiccups during your quests, please file them on our issue tracker.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are excited to announce that Rise of the Dragon  is now ready for public testing. This is the first of a small number of games built using the DGDS (Dynamix Game Development System) engine.
The Dynamix name may be familiar – bought by Sierra in 1990, the Dynamix brand continued and became well known for action and puzzle games like The Incredible Machine, A10 Tank Killer, and Red Baron.  They also made a few adventures using the custom DGDS engine.
Rise of the Dragon is set in Los Angeles in a dark version of the future, circa 2053.  You play as Blade Hunter, a private investigator and retired police officer.  After a designer drug kills the mayor's rebellious daughter, Chandra, Hunter is hired to find the people responsible for releasing the drug on the streets. What Blade ultimately finds is much more than he expected.  Rise of the Dragon combines classic point-and-click adventure style with platforming arcade sequences, giving a unique gameplay combination.
You’ll need the latest daily build of ScummVM and files from the DOS version of the game, which you can buy at GOG (check our wiki for the required data files).  Please file any issues you notice on our bug tracker.
