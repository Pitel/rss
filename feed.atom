Well, at least until the Zombies mode became a staple of the Call of Duty series, becoming as much a part of the franchise as its multiplayer and campaign modes.


Since its original inception in Call of Duty: World at War, many players have grown attached to Zombies, as it provides a fun co-op excursion from the series' standard modes. However, with so many titles now including the mode, the amount of available maps has skyrocketed. Here are the 13 best Zombies maps across all Call of Duty games.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With the amount of things that go on in our missions for democracy in Helldivers 2, we don’t know too much about all the enemies. We only focus on those that kill us so many times, like Chargers and Devastators. What about the Warrior enemy? We’ll tell you what the Warrior is in Helldivers 2 and how to complete the Personal Order related to it.


What is a Warrior in Helldivers 2?


A Warrior is a common enemy when fighting the Terminids on any of the planets to the East. They look like Brood Commanders but appear grey in color. They can actually be summoned by the Commanders, making it easier to get more kills for the daily.


Their weak spots are under the hard carapace or on their legs. Most primary weapons can deal with them easily, with shotguns excelling at taking them out in one or two shots.

How to kill 35 Warriors in Helldivers 2 for the Personal Order


35 Warrior kills might sound like a lot, but it really isn’t. Luckily, this enemy variant appears in all mission difficulties. Also, with there being a focus right now on Terminid planets because of the Major Order, you can easily farm this order in a mission or two if you’re playing on difficulty 6 or higher.


As long as you or someone in your squad gets the killing blow on a Warrior, it’ll count towards your Personal Order. If a Charger, Bile Titan, or Spewer kills them as collateral damage, it will not count. 


If you want to get this done quickly, find a fast mission like Eradicate the Terminid Swarm or a Blitz, you can get this done in one or two sessions. Missions with less time will spawn more enemies, heavily increasing the chances of Warriors to spawn. Just bring proper equipment to deal with other headaches the Swarm throws at you.

In February, Xbox head Phil Spencer expressed interest in bringing Call of Duty to Game Pass. Diablo 4 became the first Activision Blizzard title to join the service on March 28. All eyes shifted to Call of Duty, as the next title is rumored to release in early November. Like other day-one releases some Xbox players expect that it will be available on launch day with a Game Pass subscription, but that might not be the case.

Now, players will be able to earn rewards from their purchases, including exclusive cards, sleeves, and more. 


Launching a product in the same space as Magic: The Gathering should be challenging because that TCG is already so massively popular. However, Sorcery: Contested Realm proved that it's possible and has managed to adopt a fan base that's so hungry for its products that you can barely find any Beta Boosters online, and the Alpha set has more than tripled in price through resale websites. Now, there's a way for any player to get even more out of the products they've purchased through Dust Rewards.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Romance anime can get a bad rep. For all of the beautiful stories they can tell, they have to compete with the less-than-stellar options that outsiders like to balk at. However, the romance subgenre has plenty of must-watch anime series.    


Many romance anime follow a similar formula: two primary love interests slowly grow closer together, jumping over dramatic hurdles, before eventually confessing their feelings at the end of the story. Along the way, one or more rivals usually come along and create a love triangle, or something even messier. 


In its worst form, romance anime can rely on these tropes to get from start to finish without adding any substance. Stories that break this mold, or at least present this formula in a refreshing light, earned a place on this list.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[V Rising 1.0 introduces a new Difficulty system that caters to any playstyle. Server hosts can choose between various settings, including Relaxed, Normal, and Brutal modes. In this guide, we'll focus on V Rising's Brutal Difficulty to give you an idea of what to expect. 


What is Brutal Difficulty in V Rising?


Brutal mode is the most challenging Difficulty setting in V Rising, primarily reserved for veteran players. If you've already mastered the game's world, this mode offers a fresh, intense experience. V Blood bosses have evolved, forcing Vampires to change up the strategies they established in Early Access.

The mode is not just about increased difficulty; it's about strategic mastery. V Blood Bosses now have a variety of moves on the battlefield, and their health and damage rates have also been amped up. With their higher levels, they'll pose a significant challenge, demanding careful planning and execution. Enemies, in general, are going to be brutal, with damage rates boosted all around. 


While Brutal mode may appear daunting, Stunlock Studios has included several advantageous features. You can anticipate more frequent loot drops and slower item durability depletion. Of course, enemy forces will still be difficult to handle, but the improved materials will provide a solid foundation for survival. 


Hosts can embark on Brutal Difficulty mode whenever they are setting up a server. Various modes are available here, such as PvE and PvP Squad servers. Relaxed and Normal settings are also available if you ever want to take a breather at any point. While Relaxed primarily focuses on exploration and building, Normal features a balanced experience with much more combat.

You should be able to unlock Obol Points in Hades 2 after you speak enough times with Charon. Whenever you see the chat icon appear above his head, be sure to have Melinoë strike up a conversation. You may also need to give Charon at least one bottle of Nectar, unlocking his Keepsake. That's what I did before he offered me the card for the first time, so if he hasn't gifted one to you yet, save a bottle for him.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One new feature that may have slipped under your radar with the recent Season 3 Reloaded update for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 are the weapon prestige camos. These new camos are unlockable in-game by anyone, not for purchase. So when you see someone with a shiny gold-leafed gun you've never seen before, here's how to unlock it yourself.


How to get weapon prestige camos unlocked


Screenshot from Destructoid


Weapon prestige camos in Modern Warfare 3 are unlocked by doing one thing: using a gun a lot. The only way to get the one available camo right now is to earn a tremendous amount of XP with a single weapon. Doing so will unlock the camo just for that weapon. Unfortunately, that means you'll have to earn that XP repeatedly for every weapon you want the camo on. 


The 'One Trick' gold camo can be found and tracked under the 'Weapon Prestige' tab while viewing a weapon's camo options. It's unlocked by completing a challenge, which is to earn 150,000 weapon XP. Though it sounds like a lot, if you play the game fairly often and always use the same weapon, it won't take too long. Unlocking it for every other weapon, however, might be a bit of a grind.


Can you unlock the classified weapon prestige camos?


While viewing the weapon prestige camos for a weapon, you can see there are a few more listed. Though each one is blocked out with 'Classified' written over it. When hovering over each of these options, it says they'll become available in future seasons. It looks like we'll get a single weapon prestige camo per season, as one says Season 4, another Season 5, and so on. 


For now, the One Trick weapon prestige camo is the only one you can earn by getting 150,000 XP per weapon. XP is earnable faster by completing challenges with the weapon of your choosing, which includes challenges for other camos on each weapon, if you don't already have them all.

When did Warframe come out?


The original Warframe came out officially on March 25, 2013, only on PC at the time. Before that, there were open and closed betas that took place prior to its global release. If we’re getting technical, the game was originally released back on October 25, 2012, in a Closed Beta state. Players who opted into the Beta were able to carry that progress over into the full release of the game.


As the game started to receive more traction, Warframe eventually came out on the PlayStation 4 on November 15, 2013, in North America. Two wee…]]></summary>

In multiplayer, Sledgehammer Games was forced to take action after the shotgun took over MW3 matches. Meanwhile, the conversion kit failed to make the exciting splash many anticipated in Warzone, leading to a re-evaluation from Raven Software as well. 


Completing the Week 5 challenges unlocks the JAK Wardens Conversion Kit, transforming the Lockwood MK2 marksman rifle into Akimbo shotguns. In MW3, players fell in love with the weapon as it was capable of one-shot killing an enemy from up to 29 meters away, and had better mobility stats than other options in the class. As a result, you would be hard pressed to see any other shotguns in multiplayer beside the JAK Wardens.

If you’re thinking of getting into it with friends, you might wonder if it’s cross platform.


No, not really.


I’m basing this off the definition that cross platform means that players on PC can interact with ones on the game’s two console releases. That’s not possible. However, you can play with players on other systems in the same console family.


That is to say, if you have the PlayStation 5 version, you can play with someone who is using a PlayStation 4. Likewise, Xbox Series X|S players can still interact with the Xbox One player base, and PC can play with Mac.


However, PC gamers can’t play with PlayStation users, and PlayStation people don’t inhabit the same world as those on Xbox.


Does Elder Scrolls Online have cross platform progression?


The logical next question might be whether or not your progress carries in Elder Scrolls Online  between platforms. If you start playing on PC and find your friends prefer PS5, can you simply move over to the PS5 and still have access to your characters and unlocks?


No, you can’t do that either.


While you can sign into ESO using the same account on all platforms, that’s merely for login purposes. Progress is, once again, locked to one family of platforms (PS4/PS5, Xbox One/Series X|S, PC/Mac). Crowns, experience, and purchased items are locked to where they were originally granted.


On top of that, it isn’t possible to transfer characters between platforms. Even if you submit a ticket to Zenimax, the staff there are unable to move characters across servers or platforms, even in the back end. You’re stuck with the platform you choose.

One such weapon is the Moonstone Axe, with various Boons and Daedalus Hammer upgrades able to make up for certain drawbacks. Here are the best Boons for the Moonstone Axe in Hades 2.


The best Boons to improve the Moonstone Axe in Hades 2


There are two builds you can go with the Moonstone Axe in Hades 2, centering around both its Attack and Omega Attack. Its Special isn't bad, but is more of a supporting ability than a primary source of damage. As for which of these two you should go with, it'll depend heavily on the Daedalus Hammer choices you select.


If you want to do an Attack-based build, Hell Splitter is your best bet. This turns your primary attack into a slow-hitting slam that does 300 dam…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The monstrous Hollows harness a unique ability to transform into the Arrancar. This technique opens various Cero paths, each providing a unique power. Here is the best Cero path to use in Type Soul. 


What is the best Cero path in Type Soul?


Of all the abilities, Cero Cornea is the best Cero path in Type Soul due to its heavy damage rates and versatile range. When active, players can move a circular radius to anywhere they desire, blasting the enemies into oblivion on impact. It can be placed up close or at a distance, perfect for any scenario.


Screenshot by Destructoid


Following closely behind the Cero Cornea is the Tri-Cero. This power illuminates the battlefield with its three lethal beams, inflicting damage on the left, right, and center positions. It covers a significant portion of the area and can be even more devastating when combined with Kendo powers (similar to Cero Cornea). 


Type Soul Cero path tier list


We've compiled a tier list for a comprehensive view of all Cero paths in Type Soul. This list ranks the Cero paths based on their effectiveness and versatility, providing you with a guide to choosing the best path for your playstyle.


S Tier



Cero Cornea


Tri-Cero



A Tier



Cero Grab



B Tier



Blade Cero



C Tier



Finger Cero



While Tri-Cero and Cero Cornea dominate the field, the other Cero paths cater to specific playstyles, offering a variety of choices. For instance, Cero Grab is a boon for melee users, allowing them to seize an enemy and deliver a fiery blow. On the other hand, Blade Cero is a precision striker's dream, unleashing a brutal attack in a single line. 


Even if Finger Cero is in the C tier, it can still be considered one of the best paths to use in Type Soul. Its speed and counters make up for its weaker damage rates. You'll likely need to practice around with Finger Cero to get the hang of it, giving you more power in the palm of your hands.

It's normal for readers to wonder why I'm making a fuss about such a thing, so allow me to shine the light of context upon this very important piece of news.


Way back when, a 1998 issue of Electronic Gaming Monthly featured an April's Fools joke claiming you could unlock Akuma as a secret playable character in RE2. The magazine said you could unlock Akuma simply by typing in the word AKUMA, instead of GUEST, on the laboratory computer. Oh, and beat both scenarios six times with an A ranking, using only the knife and handgun.

When playing through Little Kitty, Big City, it’s difficult to avoid drawing comparisons with Untitled Goose Game. Both see you play as a cute, mischievous animal, and both have you tackle a series of emergent tasks that often come at the expense of the poor humans that inhabit the surrounding area.
With Little Kitty, Big City, however, developer Double Dagger Studio has taken the opportunity to draw inspiration from the game’s feisty feline protagonist and make the experience a bit more whimsical, a bit more stylised, and a bit more ambitious. The end result is a true joy to behold and play, but one that’s also held back from true greatness by its repetitive structure.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stray Gods: The Role-Playing Musical, a creative and ambitious attempt to fuse musical theatre with interactive fiction, launched last August, but that's not the last time fans will get to experience that modern take on Greek myth. Announced today at LudoNarraCon, the game is getting DLC called Stray Gods: Orpheus, which follows the titular character through a new adventure. Check out the reveal trailer below.


Orpheus (played by Rent star Anthony Rapp) appeared in the base game, but only briefly, so this expansion will give players a better idea of his backstory and personality. The trailer also features Hermes (played by Erika Ishii), though their exact role in the DLC isn't clarified. The experience is roughly two hours long with six new interactive tracks and features some returning songwriters, including Austin Wintory, Simon Hall, and Montaigne, but also adds comedic musician Tom Cardy to the mix.
As for the plot, the following excerpt from a press release explains what to expect. "When the curtain has fallen and the show is over, who do you go home as?" it reads. "Choose to reject, embrace, or rewrite the stories the world expects of you. Is the mortal world ready for the return of Ancient Greece’s most infamous bard?"

Stray Gods: Orpheus hits PC on June 27, with a console release date "coming soon." For more Stray Gods, check out our feature on how it was made. For more Greek mythology, visit our Hades II coverage hub for this month's exclusive coverage.]]></summary>

See, these are the kinds of glacial changes of focus and ponderous shifts of strategy you often get at very large videogame publishers such as Microsoft.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hades 2 can be a bit weird about its resources since you’re never guaranteed to see them in a single run. Because their appearance is somewhat random, multiple runs could leave you still unclear about where to find certain things. G Rock, an item needed to create the Argent Skull weapon is one such example.


To be clear, “G Rock” isn’t what the resource is actually called. It’s Glassrock. As of right now, when listed as an ingredient, some items get abbreviated. It’s just kind of strange that the most important qualifier in the name was what squished down so much.


In any case, Glassrock is a mineral, which means that, just like silver, you need the Crescent Pick to extract. You almost certainly have it by now.


You find Glassrock (G Rock) in the Fields of Mourning, which is the third area on the descent route. This means you will need to be able to handle Hecate, as well as Scylla and the Sirens.


Screenshot by Destructoid


The good news is that once you reach the Fields of Mourning, Glassrock is hardly a rare resource. The bad news is that the areas are, true to their name, largely wide open areas where it’s easy to overlook something. If you have done the Reagent Sensing incantation, that helps, as it will point you in the direction of any resources once you’ve cleared the area.


You’re probably familiar with resources by now, so Glassrock (G Rock) looks like sharp, black rocks. They have a shine to them which signifies that they’re harvestable, but because of their dull color, they can be easy to overlook.


Once you have Glassrock, the most obvious usage for it is to create the Argent Skull. However, afterward, you’ll also find that G Rock is important in creating some of the Aspects, such as the Aspect of Thanatos and the Aspect of Artemis. For now, it might be best to just stock up, which means taking the crescent pick with you to the Fields of Mourning.

To start unlocking items, look for the Polar Patriots Warbond in the Acquisition Center of Helldivers 2. Open up the game and press the button or key next to 'Acquisitions' at the top of your screen while in your ship. 


Once there, scroll down to check out the Warbond. It'll be there below the prior Premium Warbond, Democratic Detonation — which still has at least one decent gun left. Like before, the Warbond costs 1,000 Super Credits. The premium currency can be purchased with actual cash, or you can go farming for the goods. Your choice.…]]></summary>

The game in question is cheery co-op shooter Helldivers 2, over which Aunty Sony recently upended a can of furious worms by abruptly insisting that Steam players have a PSN account for security reasons and so, blocking players in regions where PSN isn't available. Sony have subsequently walked back the requirement following a backlash of truly hellish proportions, though I understand that the game remains unavailable on Steam in certain regions. By comparison, Arrowhead CEO Johan Pilestedt's remarks overnight that the developers might have been "removing the fun" with their gun balancing seem pretty innocuous.

James isn't here, so Nate makes up some hardware news that's very exciting and yet disturbing, while he does have a mythology-themed mini game in the tower of jocularity. Plus: the games we've been playing this week, including a cute survival horror and RimWorld, still. Also, Nate asks me to explain what the hap was heckening with Helldivers 2, and if Joel remains safe.

Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League was likely never going to perform well for Warner Bros.

I confess, I found this response annoying - partly because I was hoping Johanas would bring up some obscure indie composer I could then namecheck at parties, and partly, because I have spent years waiting for Tango to escape Mikami's shadow after essentially announcing themselves as a Mikami fan project back in 2010.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[More cuts at Xbox are reportedly on the way, with some staff at ZeniMax getting offered voluntary severance agreements this week. This news comes from a Bloomberg report that says employees across the Xbox organization have been told to expect more cuts. 
These potential layoffs would follow Xbox's decision to shutter four Bethesda studios earlier this week, including Hi-Fi Rush team Tango Gameworks and Redfall developer Arkane Austin. As for the staff offered voluntary severance agreements, Bloomberg reports that producers, quality assurance testers, and other staff at ZeniMax are receiving them. 


The publication also reports the reason Tango Gameworks and Arkane Austin were shut down this week is that they were in the process of pitching new projects and hiring additional staff for said projects, something suggested by ZeniMax head Jill Braff and Xbox president Matt Booty during a town hall held this week. Xbox and ZeniMax chose to shut these studios down – both in the beginning processes of creating new games – instead of closing a studio deeper in development on projects. 
Elsewhere in Bloomberg's report, which details an internal town hall held at Xbox following the studio closures this week, Booty reportedly described its studios as spread too thin, like "peanut butter on bread," and that leaders across the company felt understaffed. Xbox closed three studios and had ZeniMax Online Studios absorb Roundhouse Games to free up resources. Braff said during the meeting, "It's hard to support nine studios all across the world with a lean central team with an ever-growing plate of things to do. I think we were about to topple over." 
These studio closures follow the January layoffs of 1,900 employees at Xbox, Activision Blizzard, and ZeniMax, which add to the total of more than 10,000 laid off in the games industry just this year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Senua's Saga: Hellblade II hits Xbox Series X/S and PC later this month on May 21. However, its release arrives at a rocky period for Xbox, which just shuttered four Bethesda studios, including Hi-Fi Rush team Tango Gameworks and Redfall developer Arkane Austin. As a result, Xbox players have wondered how safe Hellblade II developer Ninja Theory might be after its sequel's release, given Hi-Fi Rush was a "break out hit" for the company but wasn't enough to keep Tango open. 
Perhaps to help boost Hellblade II's sales, Xbox is reportedly considering bringing the game to PlayStation 5, according to The Verge. The publication's Tom Warren writes, "I understand Hellblade II is another game that Microsoft has been considering for the PS5. If that ever happens, at this point, it's not clear if even that would be considered a success." 


Hellblade II coming to PS5 wouldn't be out of left field, considering Xbox has brought previously exclusive games like Grounded, Sea of Thieves, and Hi-Fi Rush to PS5 this year. However, with the launch of Hellblade II happening in just a few weeks, it seems if it does come to PS5, it will be post-launch, which lines up with Xbox's strategy in this realm thus far. 
Senua's Saga: Hellblade II hits Xbox Series X/S and PC on May 21, 2024. 
For more about the game, check out the Senua's Saga: Hellblade II PC specs and system requirements, and then read about how Senua's Saga: Hellblade II will be locked to 30 FPS on Xbox Series X/S. After that, read about how the game will have a photo mode at launch.

From the moment we got a glimpse of Animal Well during an Indie World Showcase last April, it sent tongues wagging with its unique premise and visual identity, becoming an easy add to plenty of ‘Most Anticipated’ lists. Its association with indie publishing label Bigmode, run by popular YouTuber Jason 'Dunkey' Gastrow, added to the excitement.
Fortunately for Gastrow and solo developer Billy Basso of Shared Memory, they have a true indie darling on their hands that not only lives up to the hype but relishes in the fact that its labyrinth of secrets aims to challenge players for years to come. Animal Well is the product of seven years of development by a single person, and we are delighted to report that the wait was worth it.

He was way more online when he was younger, and is the one who got me into the games of Lucasfilm, Troika and Blizzard, but these days he plays the games he likes a lot and does not read specialist websites that tell him why he shouldn't like them. He used to play loads of League Of Legends, but the game he was most into more recently was Hades. This is because he studied Classics.
I won't tell you how many years its been since he was at university, but for many years - and still sort of now, to be honest - "liking Apollo" was a key part of his personality. It's interesting, therefore, to text him about Hades 2. Partly because he wasn't even aware it was happening.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Computers have always been animal wells, in a sense. They're havens for creatures of many shapes and degrees of literalness, all the way down to the metal. As in ecologies at large, the most abundant and widespread are probably the bugs, beginning with the moth that flew into that Harvard Mark II in 1947 and ending with the teeming contents of the average free-to-play changelog. A little further up the food chain we find "worms", like the Creeper that once invaded the ARPANET, and "gophers", a directory/client system written in 1991 for the University of Minnesota. There are computer animals spawned by branding - foxes of fire and twittering birds and the anonymous beasts that haunt the margins of Google documents. There are computer animals that are implied by the verbs we use in computing - take "browser", derived from the old French word for nibbling at buds and sprouts, which suggests that all modern internet searches are innately herbivorous.

Animal Well pleased, surprised, or scared me with something new at every turn as it confidently jumped from one idea to the next up until its conclusion. That novelty lost its luster near the end of its 8-to-10-hour runtime as I treaded the fresh sheen off familiar ground, but it never lost its lively, naturalistically wild heart – even when occasional difficulty spikes compounded that staleness. Still, its tense atmosphere is inherently compelling. Illuminated by dangling lanterns and brought to life with lovingly animated animals and Rube Goldberg-like puzzles bu…]]></summary>

This comes from a new report at The Verge that follows news earlier this week that Xbox was closing some of its Bethesda studios, including Hi-Fi Rush team Tango Gameworks and Redfall developer Arkane Austin. 
The Verge's Tom Warren writes, "Microsoft has also had internal debates about whether to put new releases of Call of Duty into Game Pass. I understand this is a debate that has been ongoing internally for quite some time, with concerns from some that the revenue that Call of Duty typically generates for Activision Blizzard will be undermined by Game Pass."

A less demanding Manor Lords? A more casual Crusader Kings III? Total War with training wheels? It’s got shades of all these games, but thrown together with a wonderfully vibrant wood craft art style. It ends up as something I feel is going to be a lot more approachable for players who like the idea of massive medieval simulations but don’t care to spend time reading a Magna Carta-fat wiki to learn exactly what pop growth percentage is. I know what it is, and most days I wish I’d saved that brain space to e.g learn how to keep house plants alive instead.

Capcom has confirmed that the Resident Evil franchise has now sold a ridiculous 157 million units since the franchise's launch back in 1996.
Granted, we can't imagine a huge percentage of sales have come from the Switch, where several titles were sadly relegated to 'Cloud Versions', but it's still an impressive feat nonetheless.

Tokyo-based localiser 8-4, Ltd. has offered to assist in translating Retro Game Challenge 1 + 2 Replay after Bandai Namco had confirmed that the game was not being planned for a Western release.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[MultiVersus makes its grand return on May 28, and a new trailer reveals that the Joker is joining the roster. Even better, Mark Hamill is voicing the Clown Prince of Crime once more.
Though we don’t see gameplay, a cinematic trailer sets up a dramatic confrontation (and likely emotional reunion for fans) between Batman, voiced in the game by the late Kevin Conroy, and his archnemesis. 


This marks the first game to feature both Batman: The Animated Series actors together as their respective characters since 2018’s Lego DC Super Villans. Conroy passed away in 2022, and prior to 2024's Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, MultiVersus was the final game to feature his Batman performance. Following his death, Hamill had alluded to retiring the Joker role for good. However, dataminers uncovered Joker’s existence in MultiVersus in 2022 and found audio files revealing Hamill’s performance. This means he likely recorded his lines before Conroy’s passing. 
Joker is the first new character to join the existing line-up of fighters, but he won't be the last. We're curious to see who else joins the fray after MultiVersus re-launches on May 28 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.]]></summary>

Soapbox features enable our individual writers and contributors to voice their opinions on hot topics and random stuff they've been chewing over. Today, Kevin wonders if Nintendo is ready to bring another dimension to its Maker series...

If you can believe it, Super Mario Maker was released for the Wii U nearly nine years ago. The game was an integral part of Mario’s 30th anniversary celebration, though quite a lot has happened since then. Back in 2015, the idea of Nintendo sharing a user-friendly toolkit and giving us the go-ahead to make a new game ourselves was an incredibly exciting prospect. 8- and 16-bit-style indie games were undergoing something of a renaissance at the time too, and Mario Maker was essentially a crash course in side-scroller fundamentals.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A recent update for procgen whodunnit sim Shadows of Doubt added "Sharpshooter Assassins" with high-powered rifles to the game's glowering alternate-1980s cities, with players having to work out the killer's vantage point by deducing a bullet's trajectory, before proceeding to a secondary crime scene to search for a murder weapon and witnesses.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sega has revealed Sonic Rumble, a 32-player mobile platforming battle royale, and it's coming this winter. As is par for the course of battle royale-type games, Sonic Rumble puts 32 players against each other competing on various levels and obstacle courses to remain the last person standing. 
In the reveal trailer, it's clear players control various characters from the universe of Sega's Sonic the Hedgehog series, including Sonic, of course, Tails, Knuckles, Shadow, Amy, Dr. Eggman, and presumably more. As you play, you collect rings and these are used to customize your characters in special outfits and more. 
Check it out for yourself in the Sonic Rumble announce trailer below: 


There's no release date for Sonic Rumble yet, but Sega says it's releasing this Winter. Given it's a mobile game, it's expected to hit iOS and Android. If you're interested in trying the game out, you can sign up for beta tests right now. 
For more about everyone's favorite blue blur, read Game Informer's Sonic Frontiers review, and then read Game Informer's Sonic Superstars review. After that, watch Game Informer's exclusive video interview with Sonic's Takashi Iizuka about Sega's road to the Dreamcast.

Not to mention my love of just riding endlessly in a direction on horseback in Red Dead Redemption 2 and Assassin's Creed Odyssey (helped by Kassandra's wonderful command of "Phobos!" to summon her mount).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Confident design is one thing, but there is confidence, and then there’s the almost reckless certainty required in both your game’s sturdiness and the player’s curiosity to trust a feckless, glitch-hungry, poking-and-prodding player with Prey (2017)’s GLOO Cannon. Here is a first-person game set in a sprawling, multi-tiered, metroidvania-esque space station - one boasting multiple-bathroom verisimilitude - which then immediately gives the player a gun that lets them bypass the level gating by letting them make their own ladders up keycard-locked grav-elevators.

But the thing with FGTG is that there's always a little bit more to deal with than you think.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo has revealed Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition, a game designed around speedrunning challenges and more across 13 classic NES games. Set to hit Switch on July 18, Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition features more than 150 challenges to complete, and you can compete for top spots on global online leaderboards or with friends. 
Nintendo revealed this compilation title with a trailer that pulls heavy on the Nintendo World Championship nostalgia, with previous winners appearing, footage from old competitions, and more throughout. 
Check out the Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition announcement trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, challenges in the game include reaching the Super Mushroom as fast as you can in Super Mario Bros., defeating the Octorocks the fastest in The Legend of Zelda, and reaching a specified gate as quickly as possible in Metroid. And those are just three of the 150+ challenges available in the game, spread across 13 NES games. 
Each week, you can compete for the top spot in the World Championships Weekly  Global Online leaderboards, or you can compete against up to seven friends in the local eight-player Party Mode. 
"With 'byte-sized' challenges and an automatic rewind feature, you don't need to master entire games to feel like a Nintendo World Champion," the trailer's description reads. 
Alongside today's reveal, Nintendo has also unveiled a Deluxe Set for Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition. It includes collectible items, like art cards, a golden NES cartridge, and a physical game card.  

Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition hits Switch on July 18, 2024. The Deluxe Set will cost $59.99, and the digital eShop version will cost $29.99.

Yes, the latest masterpiece from First 4 Figures is a beautiful work of art, but again, it's a costly one. If you've got the cash, though, then it might well prove to be a worthwhile investment; it has glow in the dark wings, for goodness sake.

The Resident Evil series has redefined and refined survival horror in recent years, arguably single-handedly. However, as the venerable series continues to push the genre forward, a growing number of indie games are looking back to survival horror’s late ‘90s heyday for inspiration. Crow Country joins those ranks, offering a respectable nostalgic homage to the past. Veterans won’t encounter anything they haven’t seen, but the experience is comforting in its spooky familiarity.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Destiny 2: The Final Shape is set to wrap up the decade-long War of Light and Darkness story arc when it launches on June 4, but ahead of that, developer Bungie is giving players an easy way to catch up on previous expansions. Unveiled yesterday under the initiative name "Expansion Open Access," all Destiny 2 players can access and play through the game's Shadowkeep (2019), Beyond Light (2020), and The Witch Queen (2022) expansions. 
"Prepare for The Final Shape with three epic campaigns and earn an arsenal of exotic and legendary gear," the Expansion Open Access trailer's description reads. And speaking of trailer, check out the Destiny 2 Expansion Open Access trailer for yourself below: 


Now, of course, these three aren't the only Destiny 2 expansions but they're the only ones currently available to play through in the game. As such, it might be smart to watch a playthrough or read a narrative summary of all expansions released before The Final Shape next month. 
Here's every Destiny 2 expansion/DLC released since the game's launch: 
Curse of Osiris (2017)
Warmind (2018)
Forsaken (2018)
Shadowkeep (2019)
Beyond Light (2020)
The Witch Queen (2022)
Lightfall (2023)
The Destiny 2 Expansion Open Access period lasts from now until June 3. If you're a PlayStation Plus subscriber, you also currently have access to Lightfall, making now a perfect time to catch up. 
For more, watch the Destiny 2: The Final Shape reveal trailer here, and then check out this breakdown of The Final Shape's new prismatic subclass, enemy faction, exotics, and more.

        <updated>2024-05-08T12:02:46.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Arkane Austin was reportedly set to release a big Redfall update this month that would have added offline play to the always-online game before Microsoft suddenly shut the studio down, according to IGN. This follows yesterday's news that Microsoft was shutting down Arkane Austin, Hi-Fi Rush developer Tango Gameworks, Mighty Doom studio Alpha Dog Games, and absorbing Roundhouse Games into ZeniMax Online Studios.
This offline play update would have addressed one of players' biggest complaints with the game – that Redfall always requires a connection to the internet – but now that update will never see the light of day. It's an especially concerning detail considering now that Arkane Austin is closed, the day when Redfall servers are no longer live, rendering the game unplayable, seems closer than ever before. 


IGN also reports that it was told the now-canceled Hero Pass, which would have added two additional playable characters to Redfall, was scheduled for release around Halloween. It obviously won't be released now – Bethesda says those who purchased the Hero Pass will be eligible "to receive the value of the upgrade" – but if it had hit the game around Halloween, that would have been roughly 18 months after Redfall's launch. 
Redfall hit Xbox Series X/S and PC on May 2 to poor reviews from critics – read Game Informer's review here – and players alike, and the first-person multiplayer vampire shooter failed to recover, with Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer saying, "I'm upset with myself," when asked about its launch.
According to reports, some of Arkane Austin's staff hoped Microsoft might cancel Redfall or reboot it as a single player game, following the former's acquisition of ZeniMax Media in 2020 for $7.5 billion. Arkane Austin director Harvey Smith said Microsoft canceled a PlayStation 5 version of Redfall following this acquisition.

Its zany premise of broomsticking across badlands in search of delicious candy, coupled with a magical mix of coloured gem grabbing, weapon power-ups, flashy bomb attacks, and mouthy fairies, have been staples in every instalment since the beginning.
Bar one pachinko outlier, most Cotton games follow the same 2D horizontal shooting format, including 2021's Cotton Fantasy: Superlative Night Dreams. But with Panorama Cotton, a 1994 Mega Drive exclusive and one of the system’s most technically impressive titles, Success switched the action to a 3D perspective, plotting the camera behind Cotton's back. It delivered a Space Harrier-style dynamic across eye-bleedingly colourful stages, occasionally with varying paths.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Even as Nic spent this morning writing lovingly about frogs, I was watching trailers of frogs disintegrating beneath an unstoppable ant tsunami. The game in question is Empires Of The Undergrowth, an RTS from developers Slug Disco and Manor Lords publisher Hooded Horse. The 1.0 version launches on June 7th, after almost eight years in early access during which Empires Of The Undergrowth has accumulated positive user reviews with truly antlike meticulousness. Here's the release date trailer, which you should not watch if you dislike seeing various larger insects and small animals getting eaten alive by ants.

The employee, "Spitz", was let go following the fiasco in which Sony told PC players they would need to link their Steam and PlayStation Network accounts to continue playing the shooter. Sony and Arrowhead changed their mind about that after player backlash in the form of 100,000+ negative reviews on Steam. The kicker? Community manager "Spitz" was low-key encouraging players to continue the review bombing. This doesn't seem to have gone down well internally.

Everyone can empathize with waking up late at night and sitting in agony as your brain forcefully makes you relive a traumatic, embarrassing, or heartbreaking moment. Our past is with us forever, and how it manifests in the present is a toss-up from day to day. With My Past, the debut game from developer Imagine Wings Studio, attempts to blend those feelings with platforming-puzzle gameplay and does so excellently. The result is a therapeutic five-hour adventure I'll be thinking about long after today.

        <id>122520</id>
        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/05/07/marvel-snaps-may-2024-season-takes-a-turn-for-the-multiverse-with-blink-and-the-exiles"/>
        <updated>2024-05-07T19:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The success of Marvel Snap rolls on, as does the seasonal structure of the free-to-play, deck-building card-battler from Second Dinner. Recent seasons have been themed after corners of the Marvel Universe, like Avengers vs. X-Men or Thunderbolts, but this season leans a bit more into the Marvel Multiverse with Blink and the Exiles. This season, titled "A Blink in Time," introduces five new characters, two new locations, and more.
The new characters joining the game in A Blink in Time are as follows:
Blink (5 Cost, 7 Power)

	
On reveal, swap the last card you played with a higher-cost card from your deck.

	
Nocturne (3 Cost, 5 Power)
	
You can move this once. When this moves, replace its location with a random new one.

	
Sage (3 Cost, 0 Power)
	
On reveal, +2 power for each different power among all other cards here.

	
Namora (5 Cost, 6 Power)
	
On reveal, give +5 power to each of your cards alone at another location.

	
Sasquatch (6 Cost, 10 Power)
	
Costs 1 less for each card you played last turn.

                  

On top of those all-new characters joining Marvel Snap collections, there are two new locations: Panoptichron, where cards that didn't start in your deck get +2 power, and Cancun, where power at that location doesn't count toward winning the game. New albums featuring Dan Hipp and Rian Gonzales also further incentivize Variant collections by rewarding items themed after Werewolf By Night, Silk, and Iron Lad. Finally, we know the dates of the Series 5 releases of this season. Baron Zemo and Nocturne get their Series 5 release on May 7, Sage arrives on May 14, Namora on May 21, and Sasquatch on May 28.
Marvel Snap's May season, A Blink in Time, kicks off today. For more on Marvel Snap, check out Charles Harte's opinion piece from when the game originally arrived on mobile devices.]]></summary>

Nokia skončila se Symbianem a přešla na nově vznikající systém Windows Phone. Výsledek se dostavil o 4 roky později, kdy Microsoft definitivně vydáním posledního telefonu s Windows Phone současně celou akvizici za 7 miliard dolarů odepsal a začal se soustředit na jiné cesty jak vydělávat v mobilním světě.]]></summary>

The first of which, understandably if you don’t happen to carry a burning penchant for cultishly adored but undeniably niche 80’s schlock, is simple: Why? First, why get invested in another asymmetrical multiplayer game from a studio that has a bit of a history with limited shelf lives? And why, of all the licenses, have they chosen one so relatively forgotten, at least in comparison to Predator, Ghostbusters, and Friday the 13th?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You won't be surprised to know that after two years in early access, V Rising's 1.0 launch hasn't seen Stunlock Studios drastically change the V for "Vampire" to V for "Venetian Blinds" or "Vienna Sausage". From a top-down view, you still play as a newly awakened vampire on PVE, PVP, or private servers, and you're still tasked with becoming the most powerful bloodsucker around. It has, however, streamlined some things and added in an endgame zone. All of this combines to form a survival game that was great back then and is even better now, with thrilling MOBA-esque fights and little in the way of faff.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hardcore tactical FPS Gray Zone Warfare is proving to be yet another of 2024’s unexpected successes, shifting over half a million copies when it launched into early access last week. Unfortunately, in its attempt to eat Escape from Tarkov’s lunch – a timely one, given that game’s self-inflicted DLC misery – it’s currently choking on the wishbone of some truly dire performance issues. Even players with tip-top graphics cards are seeing heavy stuttering while out in the field, and none of the updates released thus far, including today’s Hotfix #3, have done much to soothe it.
Said hotfix does include some fixes for other widespread problems, including a second attempt at preventing players from becoming headless when rejoining a server (an amusing though resilient glitch, given a previous hotfix had also tried to nix it). But having played a bit of this third patch on a usually reliable RTX 4060, there’s clearly an awful lot of work left to do before Gray Zone Warfare performs acceptably.

Naturally, our favourite gods and goddesses are emerging from our evenings of hacking and/or slashing. For me, Nemesis provides a lot of chuckles. Not because she's bright and jokey (she is frownier than a wet bulldog). But because she's determined to put the player in their place and to beat you at your own roguelike. Narratively, she fulfills a role similar to Meg in the first Hades, that of closest frenemy. But in gameplay terms, Nemesis won't stoop to something as trite as a boss battle. Oh no. She's out to mess with your build.

The studio says it canceled Codename Kestrel to focus on other games it's developing in its portfolio, noting that because of this cancelation, its other projects will get "experienced developers reassigned from Kestrel."
Plus, Remedy says planned investment and the need to recruit additional employees for Kestrel is removed with this cancelation.

Nintendo has released its latest round of financial results, this time for the end of Fiscal Year 2024 (which ended in March). The Switch has surpassed 140 million units sold, further securing its place as the second-best-selling console in the company's history, and Nintendo has also revealed it will announce the Switch successor by March 2025. 
Despite great numbers in this round of financial results, Switch software is down roughly 5% compared to the same time frame for Fiscal Year 2023. Nonetheless, its games are still selling well comparatively in the wider market. With the latest numbers on Switch software, here's Nintendo's most up-to-date list of its best-selling Switch games:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo has revealed the Switch has surpassed 140 million units sold, further securing its current place as the second-best-selling console in the company's history. This news arrives at the same time Nintendo has revealed it will announce the Switch successor by March 2025, meaning there's still some time for the Switch to catch up to Nintendo's best-selling console: the Nintendo DS. 
Since the last financial results call, the Switch has sold an additional 1.96 million units, bringing its grand total up to 141.32. That keeps it in second place, only behind the Nintendo DS' massive 154.02 million. It's possible the Switch surpasses the Nintendo DS, especially considering the Switch will likely continue to sell even once its successor is released, but that's a big 13 million-unit gap to close. 


Elsewhere in the financial results, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom has hit 20.28 million units sold, Super Mario Bros. Wonder has sold through 11.96 million, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe another 6.79 million, and Pikmin 4 3.33 million. The fiscal year ending with March 2024 was a strong one for Switch software, selling 163.95 million units in Q1 through Q3 of Fiscal Year 2024. However, compared to the same quarters for Fiscal Year 2023, Switch software is down 4.7%. 
With the Switch successor on the horizon, that number will likely be way up this time next year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo will reveal the Switch successor within the current fiscal year, which ends March 31, 2025. However, the company says there will be no mention of this successor during a Nintendo Direct it is holding in June; this Direct will instead be focused on the games coming to Switch in the second half of 2024. 
While this isn't the first hint of a Switch successor from the company, it is the most direct and comes from the same financial results where we learned the Switch has sold an additional 1.96 million units since the last one, bringing its total up to 141.32 million. Software has reached 1.235 billion units. 


"This is Furukawa, President of Nintendo," the company's announcement reads on X (formerly Twitter). "We will make an announcement about the successor to Nintendo Switch within this fiscal year. It will have been over nine years since we announced the existence of Nintendo Switch back in March 2015. We will be holding a Nintendo Direct this June regarding the Nintendo Switch software lineup for the latter half of 2024, but please be aware that there will be no mention of the Nintendo Switch successor during that presentation."
This announcement follows industry reports from earlier this year stating the Switch successor was targeting a March 2025 release date. That could still be the case given Furukawa's reveal, but given the timeline, Nintendo could also announce the successor that month, meaning we likely wouldn't have it in our hands until later that year. Only time will, though, but at least we now officially know that by this time next year, we'll know what the successor to the Switch is.

It's very pretty, and I liked the demo a lot.

This also helps in reducing the build time of the kernel and is a nice improvement. With Linux 6.10, the sysctl sentinel clearing throughout different subsystems is set to happen...]]></summary>

Second-Loop is an upcoming sci-fi shooter featuring mechs, physics puzzles, and at least one freaky umbilical-corded being struggling against the confines of a horrific laboratory womb. Video games! All of that sounds interesting. But it's the moody reflections on the rain-slick surfaces and the game's bodycam-style presentation that's really got me going "oooooo". Don't you want to say "oooooo" too? C'mere and see.

It can be a lot to dig into, given the game more or less tosses you into the deep end without context for how things work, at least initially. Instead of spending several runs figuring things out, here’s a short, spoiler-free primer explaining some core new features to get you going on the right foot.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been sampling Hades 2’s early access build on the Steam Deck, and my only complaint – besides the smooching frog having eluded me for hours – is that it’s giving me very little to write about, performance analysis-wise. Honestly, it fits the dinky PC so well you’d have thought Supergiant had decided to make this roguelike sequel a Steam Deck game that just happened to run on desktops by accident.
Hades the first was much the same, taking to the Deck like Hercules to Augean shit, but Hades 2 barely even gives away that fact that it’s unfinished. It doesn’t crash, stutter, or hang, and there’s no point in talking about settings when it runs at a practically perfect 60fps on max quality. Make that 90fps on the Steam Deck OLED, too. It’s just a fabulous game for handhelds, even in its earliest of early access days.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hades II, the much-anticipated sequel to Supergian's excellent roguelike, is entering Early Access today and is on the cover of Game Informer Magazine with incredible original art by acclaimed artist Jen Zee. Join Alex Van Aken – who visited Supergiant for the cover story and has played Hades II extensively – and myself for a look at the game's second area and boss fight. Spoilers ahead if you want to experience the locations and enemies for yourself, but otherwise, enjoy this New Gameplay Today episode!
This second area in Hades II is called Oceanus, an underwater realm Melinoë uses to bypass the armies of Chronos, the game's antagonist and Titan of Time. Oceanus is generally more difficult to navigate than Erebus, the first area, due to explosive hazards, more powerful ranged enemies, and darting schools of swordfish. The level culminates in a musical boss fight against a rock band of sirens led by Scylla, a well-known sea monster from Greek myth. Scylla sings while her keyboardist and drummer back her up. Despite sharing one health bar, the individual monsters can be stunned and knocked out of the fight, muting the appropriate instruments in the active music track.

The cover story reveals why Supergiant decided to create its first sequel, how it chose a new protagonist in Zagreus' sister, Melinoë, along with her mythological origins, and how the team is changing its approach to early access and the content it has planned for the future.

The game’s first big patch goes a step further, seemingly boosting the game’s performance to a degree that its minimum and recommended hardware specs have been lowered as a result.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ghost of Tsushima, the hit 2020 PlayStation-exclusive samurai game, rides onto PC on May 16, and ahead of the game's launch there, developer Sucker Punch Productions has revealed players will not need a PlayStation Network account to play through the game's single-player story mode, as reported by VideoGamesChronicle. However, a PSN account will be required to play through Ghost of Tsushima's multiplayer Legends mode, or if you want to use the new PlayStation PC overlay to acquire trophies and more. 
This follows news from last week where PlayStation announced (and later walked back) that Helldivers 2 players will soon be required to link a PSN account to their Steam account, leading to widespread anger in the game's community. It seems Sucker Punch is looking to get ahead of this by revealing its PSN plans ahead of the game's launch in 10 days. 
Thank you for your feedback.
May 3, 2024
If you're unfamiliar with Ghost of Tsushima: Legends, it's a standalone multiplayer experience that allows you and up to three other players to fight enemies in special missions, defeat waves of foes, and complete raids. A PSN account will be required to play Legends, but if you want to play through the game's story (and Iki Island expansion), you won't need one. 
Ghost of Tsushima hit PlayStation 4 on July 17, 2020, before launching on PlayStation 5 with a Director's Cut on August 20, 2021. This is the version of the game hitting PC in 10 days on May 16, 2024.
For more about the game, read Game Informer's Ghost of Tsushima review, and then read about why the Director's Cut of Ghost of Tsushima is a must-play for fans.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time reinvented the series in 3D and became its new gold standard, Nintendo followed up with a surreal sequel in Majora's Mask. Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days. Majora's Mask's unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.
Join Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard today and each Friday on Twitch at 2 p.m. CT as they gradually work their way through the entire game until Termina is saved. Archived episodes will be uploaded each Saturday on our second YouTube channel Game Informer Shows, which you can watch both above and by clicking the links below.

Norland is sort of The Sims meets Dwarf Fortress meets RimWorld. It gives you charge of several new kingdoms that have sprouted from the corpse of a fallen Empire and are now feuding for supremacy.

Ahead of the game's May 21 launch, developer Ninja Theory has revealed the PC specs and system requirements for Senua's Saga: Hellblade II and to play the game at its best, you'll need quite a powerful system. 
If you're familiar with Ninja Theory's work, you likely already know it pushes the envelope with technology so it might not come as a surprise your PC will need to do the same. But if you're new to this team, or just want to check if you're ready for the game later this month, we've got you covered. 


Senua's Saga: Hellblade II PC Specs And System Requirements
Below is a chart released by Ninja Theory detailing everything you need to know about running Senua's Saga: Hellblade II at its most demanding, recommended specs, and even at the bare minimum. And as you can see, it's a game that requires a lot of power (click the image to enlarge). 
Hellblade II hits Xbox Series X/S and PC on May 21. 
For more, watch the latest Hellblade II trailer here, and then read about Hellblade II's photo mode and what to expect from it at launch. After that, watch this Hellblade II gameplay trailer.

Amongst other things, they'd reach over and flick the power off while I was playing The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening. I didn't finish that game for 15 years. I'd flown the family nest before I braved the Eagle's Tower. Can you imagine what my friends would have done if I'd owned a Game Boy Camera? Probably, they'd have taken photos of... bottoms with it, and such. 
I'm aware I'm not making a great case for being a graduate of the School of Hard Knocks. The point is: I didn't have a Game Boy Camera then, so I'm delighted that the Game Boy Camera has caught on among a later generation of indie PC developers - prominent among them artist and educator Catharine Graffam, whose GB Camera Gallery: Mystery Show you can play for free in a browser.

A new survey carried out by French anti-piracy agency Arcom reveals how internet users circumvent blocking and their preferred tools. More importantly from a piracy mitigation perspective, the survey reveals why users feel the need to circumvent blocking in the first place.

Out sometime in May, it's the work of James Beech, who describes himself as "an on-again, off-again AAA veteran" with credits on Metroid Prime 4, Remnant: From the Ashes, and Crysis 3. The environments take hefty influence from Carceri d'invenzione, a series of prints created in the 18th century by Giovanni Battista Piranesi, whose name has become a byword for impossible spaces.

But others did, sometimes complaining about the art style, which was a chunky and plastic-looking departure from previous games in the series. It's now almost seven years later but at least one person has not forgotten this missed opportunity. A fighting game modder has been tinkering with shaders to bring the comic book style of previous games to Infinite. Looks cool.

Reader, I do think it's quite atmospheric, but I do not think it's all that unsettling. If anything, I find it a bit dull, in a way that's semi-frustrating. Am I missing the liminal space-liker bit of the brain a lot of people have? Am I an anomaly here?

On the one hand, you've got to deal with interdimensional horrors of various flavours, such as multiple-storey cryptids and squishy skinless wolves; on the other, invading squads of Combiney soldiers. Fortunately, you've got a big fat Ivy League brain stuffed with knowledge of killer gadgets, base construction, subterranean farming and battlefield medicine. My increasing phobia for survival games notwithstanding, I think this looks and sounds like a hoot - and it's out now in early access. Here's the launch trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Indika is very strange. The third-person adventure stars the titular character, a nun who hears voices from the devil himself. His demonic influence manifests into world-distorting gameplay sequences as Indika explores the rural wilds of early 20th-century Russia. Tack on bizarre pixel art flourishes and other overt video game elements, and we can't tell if Indika is taking itself seriously or not. But we do know that we want to keep playing it.
Join editors Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard as they explore an early section of this attention-grabbing adventure available now on PC (and PS5 and Xbox SeriesX/S later this month).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Leonardo Da Vinci's Vitruvian Man is a legendary drawing of a nude with his arms and legs reaching towards the rim and corners of a circle and square. It's often invoked as an archetype for the humanist worldview of Man the Measure and Centre of all Things, holding a perfectly proportioned universe in shape. Rin D'Lorah, the heroine of new narrative RPG Sky Of Tides, is a bit like the Vitruvian Man, and the result is a game I find at once bewitching and powerfully offputting in its refusal to satisfy the conventions of the genre.

        <updated>2024-05-02T14:38:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Keoken Interactive, developer of Deliver Us The Moon and Deliver Us Mars, has laid off nearly its entire staff. The studio’s two founders are the only remaining employees.
Founders Keon Deetman (CEO) and Paul Deetman (managing director) announced on social media that after the studio failed to secure funding during the Game Developer’s Conference (GDC) in March, it had “exhausted all our possible options for publishing, work for hire, and co-development.” As a result, the remainder of its staff has been let go. GameIndustry.biz confirmed that 13 employees were affected, 11 of which were full-time and 2 freelance contractors. 
The Deetmans have made a call for any studios with open positions to hire its affected staff. The founders plan to stay in business and have vowed to rebuild, which includes launching a Kickstarter to crowdfund Deliver Us Home,  a sequel to Deliver Us Mars. 
It was clear Keoken was in trouble when the founders posted a video in March revealing it had been unable to land a publishing deal after spending two years pitching five games to over 40 publishers. Instead, the founders decided to publicly reveal these projects to help garner interest, one of which was Deliver Us Home and two were Deliver Us The Moon spin-offs, including a VR game. 
Keoken once employed 45 employees, but the headcount was reduced to 20 by March 2024 before four more employees were let go that month. In an interview with GameIndustry.biz, the Deetmans revealed they had gone months without collecting a salary to help stay afloat.]]></summary>

        <updated>2024-05-02T14:19:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Universal Orlando Resort has released a new video detailing what to expect at its Florida-based Super Nintendo World when it opens as a land in its Epic Universe theme park next year. In it, the company confirms the land will have three rides, including the Donkey Kong Mine Cart Madness coaster that's expected to open later this year in Osaka, Japan's Super Nintendo World. 
The video includes digital fly-overs of the park, showing viewers what it will look like when it opens next year. If you've seen Super Nintendo World in Japan, this park looks nearly identical, with both the Donkey Kong Country (and mine cart coaster) section and the Mushroom Kingdom with Peach's Castle, Mt. Beanpole, the Mario Kart: Bowser's Challenge augmented-reality ride and Yoshi's Adventure dark ride. 
Check it out for yourself in the new Super Nintendo World overview video below: 


As you can see, the Donkey Kong Mine Cart Madness coaster will feature state-of-the-art track technology that allows it to create the illusion that riders will actually jump off the tracks, just like in the Donkey Kong Country games. 
Like in Hollywood's Super Nintendo World, which does not have the Yoshi's Adventure ride or the Donkey Kong expansion as a result of space at the location, and Osaka's Super Nintendo World, guests can purchase Power-Up Bands to play in interactive Key Challenges to earn coins and more. Plus, returning locations like the Toadstool Cafe restaurant and more will be at Orlando's iteration of the park. 
Here's a look at some of the locations to expect when Universal Epic Universe opens next year: 

For more details about the park, read Game Informer's breakdown of everything coming to Epic Universe next year. After that, check out photos from our visit to Japan's Super Nintendo World, and then watch this vlog of our day at the theme park.

Not ‘the country of Africa’ bad, but certainly not good enough that you’d want me on your pub quiz team. Also, I still do the Shredded Wheat rhyme internally when I have to follow directions. However, I do enjoy making maps turn a different colour in strategy games, Total War chiefly among them. Well, one such map is expanding before my confused idiot eyes, that being Total War: Pharaoh’s. It’s getting a new, distinctly Mesopotamia and Aegea-shaped bit. I believe that’s just south of Eastopotamia and Wegea.

Earlier today, we learned that Take-Two Interactive, the company-publisher behind the Grand Theft Auto series, had closed Rollerdrome studio Roll7 and Kerbal Space Program 2 studio Intercept Games. Both of those games, and many others including the recently released No Rest for the Wicked, were published by Private Division, an indie-publishing arm under Take-Two.
Now, in a new update from GamesIndustry.biz, the publication reports that Take-Two has shuttered the "vast majority" of Private Division's teams in Seattle, New York, Las Vegas, and Munich, according to one of its sources. When GamesIndustry.biz reached out to Take-Two for confirmation, the company issued the same statement that can be read in Game Informer's original story below.

Not too shabby, considering that it's mostly the work of just one person, Grzegorz Styczeń of Slavic Magic, who has hopefully found time to sleep now and then between fielding bug reports and preparing the game's first patches.
Styczeń understandably doesn't have much time for interviews right now - those troublesome archers aren't going to balance themselves - but yesterday I spoke to Tim Bender, CEO of Manor Lords publisher Hooded Horse, about how Styczeń is getting on. The answer, apparently, is: pretty good, because Styczeń has a healthy approach to early access development in keeping players close, without quite handing them the wheel.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Remember that bit in that Guy Ritchie film where Dexter Fletcher shoot a guy and then throws a glowing jar over his soldier that summons a bunch of skeletons to help him out? Me too! Must have been the direct influence for Sea Of Thieves' new Season 12, which launched earlier this week with a bang - from two smoking barrels! Among the additions in this season of the ever popular salty sea-dog open-world adventure are double barrel pistols. They deal less damage per shot but have higher rate of fire, and you can charge them up to fire both barrels at once. 
On the other end of the weapon scale are new throwing knives, capable of sneak attacks, light slashes, or, you know, throwing. You can nab any throwing knives you see lying around, too, which is fun. But honestly, the Bone Caller tool (the aforementioned jar of skeletons, which has a great Jason and The Argonauts vibe) and the Horn Of Fair Winds are are probably more useful. The winds from said horn can make your ship go faster, but can also put out fires or crowd control enemies, or for some reason make you swim faster? I don't think that makes sense, to be honest, but the horn has limited uses so as not to make you an unstoppable wind machine.

With the announcement of Fallout 76, fans are scrambling for clues that will shed light on the new game. A few concrete details come from the pre-existing information on Vault 76. Most vaults in Fallout were built for a specific purpose, and according to references in Fallout 3, Vault 76 supposedly held 500 people for exactly 20 years before opening and repopulating the surface.
Repopulation is important and all, but is this the most interesting route for a new Fallout? Playing a wastelander on a noble quest is something we’ve already done several times, but a game built around the events of a specific vault is an intriguing proposition. We delve into canon Fallout lore to reveal a bounty of bizarre and disturbing scenarios, any of which co…]]></summary>

This week, well over three years later, a 40-year-old former operator of an illicit IPTV service became the first person to be convicted under the PLSA. While a win is a win, the case wasn't entirely straightforward.

In the lead-up to the game's release date, the NBA 2K24 developer Visual Concepts released a blog post running down the features of its card-collection mode, MyTeam. In that blog post, the developer laid out several features and rewards for the then-upcoming title. It took special care to devote a section to an upcoming Collector Level reward, Kobe Bryant.

While four mainline entries – Asylum, City, Origins, and Knight – delivered similar gameplay, a smaller spin-off game, 2016's Batman: Arkham VR, let players step into the shoes of the Caped Crusader using their PlayStation VR, Oculus Rift, or HTC Vive headset. Batman: Arkham VR felt more like a tech demo than a fully fleshed-out game, but its relatively high sales showed that the appetite was there. Today, Oculus Studios announced another VR title set in the Batman: Arkham universe titled Batman: Arkham Shadow.

Justin used a large language model to answer questions about the Catholic church and Catholic orthodoxy, and if you have any familiarity with how people love to test AI chatbots - or you read the headline of this article - then you know where this is going. Fr. Justin, who was already kind of controversial anyway, offered the sacrament and claimed to be a real priest to Futurism, and gave the thumbs up to baptising a baby in Gatorade in an emergency.
Catholic Answers (who have the domain Catholic.com; gotta imagine His Holiness wishes he'd moved quicker on that one) then defrocked Justin, making him  a lay theologian in a suit jacket, jeans and an open collar shirt that gives him a "me and my wife saw you across the bar" kind of vibe, when before he had the whole dog collar kit and caboodle.

The last day also saw a peak player count of around 66,000, putting it ahead of giants like Palworld, Rimworld, and Fallout 76.

Digital rights groups hoped to end the French  'Hadopi' anti-piracy scheme, claiming that it violates the fundamental right to privacy. The CJEU's judgment leaves no stone unturned explaining why that isn't so, leaving case law to deal with the turbulence.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Zynga has released a new trailer for its upcoming competitive multiplayer game, Star Wars: Hunters, revealing a June 4 release date alongside a new cinematic look at some of the characters. Star Wars: Hunters will hit Switch and iOS and Android devices on that day, giving players the chance to compete with others in iconic locations like the forest moon of Endor, the icy planet of Hoth, and elsewhere while controlling Hunters like J-3DI, a droid who thinks he's a Jedi, Utooni which is two Jawas stacked on top of each other in a trench coat, and more. 
Zynga says each Hunter boasts their own unique set of abilities to aid them in the Arena, which is the marquee attraction of the new planet of Vespaara. "Star Wars: Hunters features a number of game modes for players to test their mettle, such as Squad Brawl, in which opposing teams will battle to rack up the most eliminations, and Trophy Chase, where competing teams will vie for control of the elusive droid TR-F33," a press release reads. 
Check out the action in the new Star Wars: Hunters trailer below: 


"We are beyond excited to welcome fans across the globe to Vespaara," Zynga vice president Sam Cooper writes in a press release. "We can't wait for gamers to meet our Hunters and hop into the Arena. There are so many fun twists and winks to recognizable, beloved Star Wars settings, creatures, and themes within our game that we also are eager to see players worldwide get the chance to discover." 
Star Wars: Hunters will be available worldwide on Switch, iOS, and Android devices. It will be free, and on Switch, it does not require a Nintendo Switch Online membership to download and play.

If you're a fan of a popular movie or TV show from any time in the last several decades, chances are, they've made a Funko Pop figurine of the main characters. The brand is ubiquitous in pop culture, so it was only a matter of time before it got a big video game adaptation. This sort of game could easily be a cheap cash grab, but after watching a preview demo and listening to one of the head developers speak about it, I'm confident that Funko Fusion is much more than that.
You've never played a game by developer 10:10 Games, but you probably know the work of its staff – the founders of the studio are some of the former architects of the Lego games developed…]]></summary>

The second, a reseller in the astrology business, just had his case suddenly dismissed. Nobody could've predicted that.
