Focus Entertainment has announced that a Nintendo Switch port of Cold Iron Studio blaster Aliens: Fireteam Elite will be launching on April 26 — The new port of the 2021 release will be handled by studio Ubitus and will be made available via cloud gaming technology.
Already available for PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms, Aliens: Fireteam Elite is a third-person shooter set within the expanded Alien universe. Players choose from one of seven marine classes — Gunner, Demolisher, Technician, Doc, Phalanx, Lancer, or Recon — before embarking on a series of story campaigns accompanied by A.I. partners or up to two additional players. Fireteam Elite attempts the capture the claustrophobic atmosphere and acid-spraying violence of the classic 1986 sequel Aliens, adopting a gameplay style similar to other team-based shooters such as Valve's Left 4 Dead.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There is not a mystery game after all
Following a recent interview with Team Ninja lead Fumihiko Yasuda, reports swirled that the studio had another game in the works, set to arrive before 2024's Rise of the Ronin. But Koei Tecmo confirms those rumors aren't accurate to Team Ninja's plans.
Speaking to Famitsu, Yasuda discussed Team Ninja's upcoming docket of games. The previously announced Rise of the Ronin is set for 2024. Yasuda also expresses a desire to release something new in 2025. The confusion arises around a certain phrasing, though.
"'Rise of the Ronin' has been under development for about 7 years and is scheduled to be released in 2024," Yasuda said. "This work will be released in 2023, and I feel like I want to release a new title in 2025."
Famitsu's interview was published online on March 11, after the release of Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty earlier this year. This, alongside mention that the game in question was in development, led to speculation and reports that Team Ninja has another game planned for 2023.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlmdeQFyqC0
Koei Tecmo clarifies
As noted in Famitsu's article, though, this interview was conducted on February 14, 2023, prior to the launch of Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty. And the interview itself is about Wo Long, too.
We reached out to Team Ninja parent company Koei Tecmo to clarify, and a spokesperson confirmed that "this work" refers to Wo Long. The spokesperson also confirms their 2023 game is Wo Long, and Team Ninja does not have another full game planned for 2023.
Which, considering Wo Long still has a season pass' worth of content on the way alongside Rise of the Ronin and thoughts of a 2025 game, is probably a good thing. Team Ninja has had a steady cadence over the last few years.
Meanwhile, Wo Long does sound like it's a pretty rad. That's out now, with added content on the way for the rest of this year.

Retro publisher Sunsoft, the studio behind 16-bit franchises such as Aero the Acro-Bat and Zero the Kamikaze Squirrel, has announced that it intends to hold its second "Sunsoft is BACK" live stream next week, featuring more information on the resurrected publisher's upcoming releases.
Sunsoft's first comeback stream, which was held in August of last year, saw the dormant studio announce a selection of new titles for the Japanese market, including the revival of '80s strategy series Ikki Unite, a remaster of 1992 platformer Gimmick!, and a rerelease of 1991 Famicom adventure Ufouria: The Saga — One of the games in the cult Hebreke franchise. In addition to these announcements, Sunsoft also teased that it had a full remake in the works, but is yet to offer up the identity of the mystery title.
Next week's stream is expected to feature new information pertaining to the above titles, and will perhaps see Sunsoft finally lift the lid on the teased remake. Of course, we may find that the studio is only planning to continue its focus on the Japanese market and some of its more obscure IPs, but it's still interesting to see the long-forgotten studio make its presence felt some 20-30 years later. We will, of course, bring you all of the news from the stream right here on Destructoid, so stay tuned, folks.
The "Sunsoft is Back" live stream kicks off April 20 at 15:00 JST / 07:00 BST / 23:00 PT.

Secret Mode has announced that it’s bringing Sumo Digital Academy’s revival of the Amiga almost-classic Zool Redimensioned to PlayStation consoles on May 16, 2023.
Zool was originally released in 1992 on the Commodore Amiga before being ported to other consoles. Despite its availability on different platforms, it’s largely considered to be an Amiga cornerstone. 2021’s Zool Redimensioned was a ground-up remake that bases itself on the Amiga version. It features widescreen support, which is a pretty revolutionary change, considering it was a game that would sometimes punish quick movements.
https://youtu.be/xTEsWEeVGm8
I enjoyed it for what it was. It was a worthwhile update, but I don’t really think about Zool Redimensioned all that often anymore. In my review, I called it a “comfortable slice of ‘90s platforming," which still sounds appropriate to me now. Good call, past me.
Along with this port comes multiplayer in the form of party modes Zool’s Gold, Rool of Zool, and Ball Brawl. Not much has been shown off about them. The trailer shows off Rool of Zool, but it’s hard to really make out what’s happening. I see bosses though, so it kind of looks fun. The patch will also be coming to the existing PC version. My family won’t play platformers with me because I exist on a higher plain of skill in that genre. Every genre, really, but don’t tell them I said that.
Zool Redimensioned is currently available on PC, and will be making its way to PS4 and PS5 on May 16.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Prepare to get wet
Futurlab has revealed its plans for the transcendental dad-game Powerwash Simulator for the rest of 2023. While a lot of these plans are currently just winks and eyebrow wiggles, it will at least give you an idea of what to look forward to.
The most concrete of plans is patch 1.2, which brings additional jobs and updates old ones to expand Powerwash Simulator’s mystifyingly deep lore. This is coming April 18, 2023, which is just around the corner, so you won’t have to wait long. This patch will be followed by another free content pack every quarter, including a “seasonal” one. While that will probably be Christmas Themed, I’d love to power-wash the feathers off a turkey.
https://twitter.com/PowerWashSim/status/1646151201237393412?s=20
Along with this is three paid DLC packs for Powerwash Simulator. They haven’t really said much on what those will involve, but they do say that they will take you outside the fictional county of Muckington to “all sorts of new and exciting places.” Space? The bottom of the ocean? How does a power washer work in a pressurized environment? Like normal, I’m guessing.
The biggest wink, however, is just “exciting news.” Ooo. I bet it’s VR, which really isn’t exciting to someone like me. Someone who doesn’t own a VR headset.
There’s also a physical version of the game on the way for consoles. I say “physical,” but the Switch version is just a download key, which is just… I don’t see the point. I should totally buy my dad the PS4 version, though.
I love Powerwash Simulator, though. It’s like a less janky version of Viscera Cleanup Detail. I can barely keep my kitchen clean, but you can bet I’ll get every nook and cranny if you give me points for it.
Powerwash Simulator is available for PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, PS4, PS5, and Switch.

The US Library of Congress has today announced the 25 tracks that will be added to its National Recording Registry as “defining sounds of the nation’s history and culture”. For the first time ever, one of these tracks comes from a video game, and it is none other than Koji Kondo's iconic theme from 1985's Super Mario Bros. that is leading the way (thanks, Gizmodo).
Joining the likes of Madonna's 'Like a Virgin' and Mariah Carey’s 'All I Want for Christmas is You' in the class of 2023, the Super Mario Bros. theme's inclusion is a huge stepping stone for video game music. In its announcement tweet (below) the Library of Congress stated that the track was "probably the most recognisable  in history", and we struggle to disagree.

Amplitude Studios is pushing back the date for its dungeon crawler. Previously set for May, Endless Dungeon will now be launching on October 19, 2023.
The roguelite action game was set to arrive in just about a month's time, on May 18. However, it sounds like Amplitude Studios is going to need a little more time to work on its dungeons.
"We want to provide the best roguelite experience possible for our community, and we think there's still more work for us to do to make sure we get there," reads today's announcement on social media. The PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Xbox One versions are now moved to this date, while the Switch version will have a release date announced later.

Don’t you hate it when you finish a hard day in the work mines, step blinking into the sunlight, and find out that the mountain you were on is now just a small island surrounded by ocean? So relatable. That’s how Flooded begins.
Flooded describes itself as a reverse city builder. What it means is that the world is currently undergoing flooding of biblical proportions, and you need to survive in small pockets of land, finish up your objectives, and escape before there’s no land left to dry your socks on. I wasn’t sure if this concept was really going to work for me, but now that I’ve played through Flooded, I realize that its design is not only palatable, but actually somewhat brilliant.

It’s clearly riffing on Alice’s Adventures In Wonderland as our protagonist, the titular Ravenlok, moves to a new inherited house, gets sucked through a magical mirror and steps into a trippy, mushroom-filled land. From there, she needs to fight this realm's off-brand Queen Of Hearts and save the remaining, slightly weird, storybook denizens.

Redfall will have options for either Quality or Performance on Xbox, but only one will be available at launch. Arkane confirms that Redfall will be launching with just the Quality option, and Performance mode will be arriving in an update after launch.
No date was specified in the announcement, just that it would arrive through a game update sometime later. So for Xbox Series X|S owners, Quality mode will be the sole option. Here's what you get on each platform with that:
Xbox Series X: 4K / 30 FPS
Xbox Series S: 1440p / 30 FPS
No resolution targets were listed for Redfall's Performance mode, but it will be the 60 FPS setting, for those who like their frames.
https://twitter.com/playRedfall/status/1646158836103880708
The streets run red
For those who prefer the crispy 60 FPS over higher resolutions, this is a bit of a bummer. I usually opt for the Performance mode whenever possible, and knowing there will eventually be an option for it honestly makes me consider holding off for a while.
Redfall does look really fun, to be fair. I've enjoyed the general theme and idea of it, it's looked solid in various trailers, and I'm a pretty big fan of Arkane's previous games. All of it seems set up for success.
Yet Redfall is also launching into a highly competitive window for attention. It arrives just after Star Wars Jedi: Survivor and just before The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. It may hold the benefit of being a multiplayer experience, whereas those other games are solo adventures, but it's still a stacked spring by any standard.
Hopefully Arkane can get this mode out the door fast. Having all the frames I can for vampire hunting will be helpful. Redfall launches on May 2, 2023 for PC and Xbox Series X|S.

If I was trying to make video games in a warzone and: a) my last game was a big sexy prequel to my long running Sherlock Holmes series; b) the one before that was a Lovecraftian detective game with pretty recent assets; and c) my back catalogue contained a Lovecraft-themed Sherlock Holmes mystery, then I'd probably do what they've done with Sherlock Holmes The Awakened. Which is to remake the old Lovecraft-themed Sherlock Holmes game, but with new assets.
It's also got new puzzles and areas, and a slightly rewritten story to account for this being a sequel to Sherlock Holmes: Chapter One. It's a smaller, less ambitious game than Chapter One with some jank knocking around, and I wouldn't recommend it if you're not a fan of the series, but you know what? I think there's a glimmer of greatness in the very fact of its constraints.

This review originally went live in 2016, and we're updating and republishing it to mark the game's arrival in Switch's N64 library via the Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pack.

With the Pokémon franchise being as super effective as it was during the late '90s due to its handheld games, trading cards, television anime and manga, it was only a matter of time before fans saw the groundbreaking series advance into home console territory — and that it did. Pokémon Stadium was released on the Nintendo 64 in the year 2000 (1999 for Japan), and it arguably fulfilled every Pokéfanatic's dream by bringing everyone's favourite 151 critters to life in three dimensions.
Pokémon Stadium's gameplay was as many expected it to be: the conventional turn-based battle formula using the familiar creatures from the Game Boy games, but now in breathtaking 3D. It was definitely something to behold at the time, for fans of the series only really had the manga, anime, and the sprites from Pokémon Red, Blue, and Yellow to visualise each Pokémon in all their glory during battle.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Illumination’s The Super Mario Bros. Movie has become a staggering box office success since its premiere last week. The animated adaptation of Nintendo’s flagship franchise has emerged from its first weekend as the best opening animated film of all time, achieving several other records along the way. 
According to The Hollywood Reporter, the film walked away with over $375 million in sales in its first five days, surpassing Frozen 2 as the top opening animated film premiere globally. That includes a $206 million domestic haul, $146 million of which was earned over the weekend (remember the film premiered on a Wednesday). Overseas, the movie has earned over $173 million.
Additionally, The Super Mario Bros. Movie is now the top opening film of 2023 (beating Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania), has become Illumination’s most successful opening, and has the best opening of any video game film adaptation (surpassing Sonic the Hedgehog 2's debut). The film also has the biggest five-day premiere ever, a record previously held by Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen. If all of that wasn’t enough, the film also has the biggest IMAX opening weekend of all time at $21.6 million globally.
Needless to say, The Super Mario Bros. Movie is exceeding expectations, and it’ll be interesting to see if it can maintain such a strong start. To get an idea of how it fares, you can read our review of the film here. Be sure to also check out our interviews with the movie’s cast and Nintendo’s own Shigeru Miyamoto and Koji Kondo.]]></summary>

Most of the game’s requirements seem pretty standard for a modern open-world game, although you’ll need some pretty powerful CPUs and GPUs to run the sequel at recommended settings and above. Ripping into hordes in graphic details might cost you.

SpongeBob SquarePants: The Cosmic Shake brought us a lot of universe-hopping, 3D platforming fun when it was released back at the start of this year, and publisher THQ Nordic has today announced that it is making some changes in the form of a new update to make the play experience even better.
The latest patch brings the game up to ver. 1.0.4.0 and is mainly focused on tweaking some bugs in the gameplay. That being said, developer Purple Lamp Studios has added some new features such as "speed running options" and the ability to change between different camera modes to ensure that the jumps between platforms are easier to handle.

So, The Tank he lived, and also died. Questing endlessly in this grimy medieval world won’t cut it. You’ll also need to keep your troupe paid and fed, so when evening fell to find nought but a handful of foraged mushrooms and a single mouldy apple I’d pried from the fingertips of a disemboweled bandit, it was time to get creative.
“Waste not, want not”, said the Earl of Human Sandwich, the inventor of cannibalism (I’m told). With this in mind, I’d invested one of my early ‘Knowledge Points’ into a tech that let me repurpose my dearly departed as delicious drumsticks. Slain friendlies don’t disappear after battle. Instead, you’ll find their tastefully dressed corpses in the loot menu afterwards. Ghoulishly, the ‘loot all’ option doesn’t add their cadavers to your inventory with the rest. You’ll have to manually drag them over, giving you just enough time to consciously make the decision to either bury or eat them. I did not bury him.

Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is just a month away, and we're finally moving out of the era of Breath of the Wild dominating the Zelda conversation. Not to say that it'll never return! In fact, I suspect a lot of folks will be comparing and contrasting the two worlds with magnifying glasses, and Breath of the Wild will still live on for many years (decades even).
On that note, let's look at this awesome trick shot from Twitter user ambi. One-upping many of the "rising up in the sky" trick shots, ambi uses the Master Cycle Zero to flip up in the air, then blow up three (hurt) Guardians simultaneously. Of course, it even has the killer finisher with the cycle: which is just behind the all-time greatest anime style finisher of walking away from an explosion.
I'm a huge fan of Master Cycle Zero anything, and thankfully, folks can seemingly create their own vehicles on a whim in Tears of the Kingdom. It's weird to think of how Nintendo will follow up Tears of the Kingdom with DLC: and I hope it's slightly different than how Breath of the Wild was handled. Maybe we'll get a huge proper non-shrine/challenge room-centric expansion this time?

Legendary anime producer TMS Entertainment has released a new trailer for its upcoming animated movie Resident Evil Death Island, which will see a who's who of Resi heroes gather together to battle the rotting forces of bio-weapons corporation Umbrella.
The new trailer is something of an exciting moment for fans of Capcom's survival horror series, as it brings together a party of beloved Resident Evil characters, some of whom will be meeting for the very first time in series history. The preview, which you can check out below, sees Redfield siblings Chris and Claire team up with former R.P.D. officer Leon S. Kennedy, S.T.A.R.S. Bravo team medic Rebecca Chambers, and — the Master of Unlocking herself — Jill Valentine. A pretty exciting team-up for the community, that's for sure, and one that frankly should have happened as the theme of Resident Evil 4.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThmEKGQC_s8&ab_channel=KADOKAWAanime
It should be noted that the trailer is, putting it mildly, fucking bonkers. Following on from some Tom Cruise-esque motorbike stunt silliness, we see our heroes battle flesh-eating zombies, undead sharks, and T-Virus packing Lickers on a deserted Alcatraz Island. At one point, Chris Redfield casually arms himself with a rocket launcher like it's nothing, and a hilarious moment sees the team attempt to one-up each other while dodging a mutated tentacle. Silly? Very. Kinda cruddy looking? That too...
The true sequel to Resident Evil 3? Absolutely.
Resident Evil Death Island will premiere in Japan July 7, Sony Pictures Home Entertainment has picked up the rights for a western release, and the film is expected to release in North America and Europe later in 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Strider Too.
Following his departure from Capcom, director Kouichi Yotsui was burdened with expectation following Strider's success. Sadly, despite his inventive, risk-taking approach to game development, he would never again win the limelight. In the mid-'90s he had a fling with Mitchell Corporation, a studio formed of ex-Capcom staff that coaxed him into creating a spiritual sequel to Strider. Known as Cannon Dancer in Japan and Osman internationally, it failed to garner enough attention to warrant a home port. 27 years on, and that injustice has finally been rectified.
Taking a leaf out of Strider's rich aesthetic tapestries, Cannon Dancer trades out dystopic Russia for the warmer climes of a futuristic Middle East; a bristling metallic skyline gilded with neon, mile-high searchlights, and a fusion of Turkish and Arabian embellishments. In real-world history, Osman was the name of the founder of Turkey's Ottoman Empire, which may indicate where Yotsui's fictitious world sits geographically.

Kloa: Child of the Forest is a gorgeous-looking pixel art action adventure game from developer Wildpad Games. Inspired by the films of Studio Ghibli and The Legend of Zelda series, the game launched a Kickstarter campaign last year — and we're not sure how we missed it despite it smashing its console port stretch goal. That means that yep, this one's coming to Switch. (Thanks, Nintendo Everything!)
Blending the puzzle solving and combat of Zelda with the fast-paced dash movement of more modern pixel art adventures, Kloa: Child of the Forest follows a young girl who must save the world from the Ikari Curse, which has tainted nature and filled the land with mysterious, twisted creatures. You have your trusty sword to hand, while also wielding a powerful magic bow to solve puzzles and shoot enemies from afar. Plus you can pick up items which will aid you in combat, such as a giant leaf, a water bomb, and more

In the early 2000s, an ancient and long-forgotten era when Capcom regularly released new Mega Man games, the company decided to produce not one, but two mainline Mega Man series on the popular Game Boy Advance. Mega Man Zero would continue the gameplay and storyline that the previous action platforming franchises were famous for, while another series—Mega Man Battle Network—would be set in its own world and follow an all-new RPG template. It was an unconventional idea, but Capcom quickly showed the value of its vision for these games, and now they’ve been brought back in their finest form yet under the Mega Man Battle Network Collection.
Available split across two volumes on the Switch eShop or on a physical cart with all 10 games, the collection includes the original GBA game and its sequel, and then each pair of subsequent sequels. So, 3 Blue and White, 4 Red Sun and Blue Moon, 5 Team Protoman and Team Colonel, and 6 Cybeast Gregar and Cybeast Falzar.

The International Game Developers Association (IGDA) has announced the first major update to its 'game crediting policies' guide in a decade, in hope of improving crediting standards across the video game industry.
Its 'Game Credits Special Interest Group' (SIG) recognises inconsistencies throughout the industry - not only from "game to game" but also in the same companies. According to SIG, employees can often be "mislabeled, unlabeled, or left off" credits even if they "spent years of their life" bringing a game to life, and this can impact "career and award" chances.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sweet, sweet fantasy
A new Sony State of Play is on the way, and it's fully centered on Final Fantasy XVI. Sony confirms the new RPG will be getting a new update this week on April 13.
The new State of Play will air on Sony's Twitch and YouTube channels on April 13, at 5 p.m. ET / 2 p.m. PT. The show will feature "more than 20 minutes" of new Final Fantasy XVI footage.
https://twitter.com/PlayStation/status/1645894612693688320
The PlayStation blog doesn't note any specifics, aside from touching on the general dark fantasy setting and battles between the Eikons and Dominants. Though the blog says the showcase will dive into "all this and more," it's fair to say this will center solely on Final Fantasy XVI.
The state of play for PlayStation
This is the second State of Play for Sony so far in 2023, though this is their first single-game-focused event. The February 2023 State of Play put a bunch of PS VR2 titles in the spotlight, as well as updates on Destiny 2's then-upcoming Lightfall, the release date for Baldur's Gate 3, and more footage of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League.
For Final Fantasy XVI, this make a fair bit of sense, as the next entry in the series first premiered at a Sony showcase back in 2020. I'm curious to see what's new to show in Final Fantasy XVI, as we did just recently get a good look at the game. Alongside a bevy of new footage, we also got some hands-on time with the upcoming action-RPG, which definitely aims for a darker fantasy setting. For more on that, check out our interview with the project's leads.
I'm curious to see what Square Enix and Sony will be showing now, and how it differs from the late February preview we got. Final Fantasy XVI isn't far off now. Whatever June 22 may hold, we'll get a pretty decent new glimpse of it on Thursday.

They can run Minecraft servers, download stuff while you're away, let you practice programming, let your younger sibling play with or against you in retro or indie games. You might already have one lying around, in which case have a think about the possibilities - but if you'd like one and don't have one in a cupboard somewhere, you can grab a cheap Dell Latitude 7390 off Ebay for £219.99 in 'good' and 'refurbished' condition. For the money, you get an 8th-gen Core i5 processor with integrated graphics, a compact 13-inch design, 16GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD. All in all, it's a pretty sweet spec for the asking price!

My love of Infernax is no secret by this point. Many indie titles have shot for NES nostalgia, but Infernax provides an experience that genuinely belongs among the console’s best. Its tight gameplay, compact map to explore, and authentic difficulty curve drives home the feeling of playing a version of Simon’s Quest that became a beloved classic instead of a series black sheep. Add in a host of secret characters and multiple endings, and you have a game just begging to be replayed.
I gleefully put in at least three runs through Infernax last year, yet the announcement of couch co-op via the Deux or Die update still peaked my curiosity. As much as I love this game, couch co-op updates to single games have left me underwhelmed in the past. For examp…]]></summary>

The Vampire Diaries follows Elena Gilbert, a high school student who discovers vampires are living in her hometown after one of them attacks her younger sister. The game is loosely based on the book series of the same name by author L. J. Smith, which later got adapted into a hit TV series.
Nancy Drew: Secrets Can Kill is the first installment of the long-running Nancy Drew game series, also based on a book series of the same name. In her first adventure, Nancy seeks to uncover the killer of a high school student who seems to have been disliked by all of his classmates.
You will need the data files from the games’ original install CDs, and a fresh daily build of ScummVM. Apart from the original release, Secrets Can Kill’s Russian translation is also supported. The ScummVM wiki pages for The Vampire Diaries and Nancy Drew: Secrets Can Kill contain information on which datafiles are needed. Please, report any problems you encounter in our issue tracker.

We're not far off from the release of Dead Island 2, which means it's probably a good time to know if your rig can handle it. Dambuster Studios has put out a list of PC system requirements for the upcoming zombie action game, as well as an FAQ to address some common questions ahead of launch on April 21.
On the PC side, it looks like you'll need a decently modern rig to play at the recommended 1080p / 60 FPS settings. That entails either an AMD Ryzen 5 5600X or Intel Core i9 9900K CPU, as well as an AMD Radeon RX 6600 XT or GeForce RTX 2070 Super. Keep sliding on up to 1440p or 4K, and the requirements get even heftier.

Fortnite is roughly halfway into its second season of Chapter 4, and that means it's Attack on Titan time. On top of the ODM (Omni-directional mobility gear) grappling system, there are also a few Titan dummies strewn about the world to slice, as well as some more challenges. Let's take a look at everything Fortnite patch v24.20 added in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEuQe0PIhsc
All the Attack on Titan stuff arriving in Fortnite
The Eren Jaeger (main character) skin can be unlocked for battle pass owners by completing certain quests, on top of extras like Attack on Titan sprays and back bling.
Captain Levi and Mikasa Ackermann are premium shop outfits.
The ODM gear allows players to grapple around (like the web shooters or grappling hook in the past): with the ability to slice/attack and hover.
Thunder Spears are a new weapon type: they're arm-launched and are explosive.
Scout Regiment lockers (themed chests) are scattered throughout the map and contain the aforementioned items.
The small Jaeger’s Family Basement area has been added.
The beloved dirt bike is back, as is the Port-a-Bunker
The Dirt Bike from the previous season has been unvaulted: which is another word for "returned to the item pool." Though it will not be playable in arena or tournaments (like Thunder Spears).
The Port-A-Bunker is unvaulted in Zero Build as well.
Some guns have been tweaked
The Mythic Havoc Pump Shotgun (which is super easy to get this season) has had its max headshot damage reduced.
The Mythic Overlocked Pulse Rifle had its accuracy and hipfire rate reduced, and the number of Pulse Rifle rewards have been reduced when capping a rift POI (like the floating island) in Trios and Squads.
Similarly, the Mythic Havoc Pump Shotgun drop count in vaults has been reduced in Trios and Squads.

A brand-new look for Night City is hitting PC today. Patch 1.62 for Cyberpunk 2077 is rolling out on PC today, with the tech preview for Ray Tracing: Overdrive Mode arriving as part of it.
This new ray-tracing mode is a hefty bit of tech. It uses fully ray-traced, or path-traced, rendering in partnership with NVIDIA. CD Projekt Red acknowledges that it's early-on, and so it's characterizing this new mode of visuals as a Technology Preview. Basically, if things get weird, it's still a work-in-progress, and CDPR plans to keep working on this mode in the future.
Keep in mind that this specific view is currently supported for a certain subset of graphics cards. The Ray Tracing: Overdrive Mode-enabled NVIDIA cards for Cyberpunk 2077 are the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the R.E.D.
Capcom has rolled out another new theme for one of its veteran World Warriors making their grand return in Street Fighter 6. And this time around it's the turn of the Red Cyclone himself, The Iron Body, weighing in at 399 pounds and hailing from Mother Russia, it's Zangief!
Zangief - R.E.D.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6caXwwXbjk&ab_channel=StreetFighter
As is the case for almost all of the new Street Fighter 6 themes, Zangief's new tune has something of an underground, garage-mix flavor. But that doesn't mean that the tune doesn't open up to the unmistakable sounds of Slavic culture. There's also a clear element of threat and danger to Zangief's tune, which puts fear back into a character that has, for far too long, been played off as something of a comedy character. And, given the devastating nature of the gameplay footage we've seen of The Iron Body in action, The Street Fighter 6 iteration of Zangief is going to be no laughing matter.
Of the scrapper's launch roster, we now need only hear the themes for Delta Red agent Cammy and club-swinging Mexican newcomer Lily, and our litany of character themes are complete. I'll admit, I fully understand the divisive nature of Street Fighter 6's "sound", but while some of the tunes leave something to be desired, I do prefer these themes to those of Street Fighter V and feel that the overall audial style is fitting with the new sequel's visual aesthetic.
Street Fighter 6 launches June 2 on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox. Be sure to check out the themes for Ryu, Chun-Li, Luke, and Jamie, Juri and Kimberly, Blanka and Dhalsim, DeeJay and JP, and Manon, and Marisa.

As a visual novel, Tron: Identity is a complete narrative but also works as a possible prologue. It lays fertile ground for possible follow-ups. Thankfully, it sounds like that’s the plan, as Disney Games Producer Heidy Vargas has said in an interview with d23 that this is just the start of their collaboration with developer Bithell Games.
It comes at the very end of the interview that Vargas states:
“There are a few other projects in the works that I can’t mention yet, but of course, TRON: Identity is the start of Bithell Games’ collaboration with Disney on TRON-dedicated games. Players can expect more TRON titles to come in the future.”

[caption id="attachment_373244" align="alignnone" width="640"] Screenshot by Destructoid[/caption]
Tron: Identity is a pretty excellent take on the property. It takes the setting and applies some new genres of storytelling to it. It comes away with its own unique, uh, identity within the property. It’s also a tight and experimental little visual novel that does what it needs to without any superficial fluff to extend runtime.
More than that, though, it’s obvious that Bithell Games was very excited to work with the property. That love and affection shine through in the finished game, and part of my enthusiasm is essentially vicarious excitement for the dev team being able to pursue this passion further. You can sign me up for seeing more of it.
Tron: Identity releases today on April 11, 2023. You can give this disc a spin on either Switch or PC.

In-person gaming events have gone through a bit of a rough patch over the last few years. E3 is seemingly dead and buried, and although Geoff Keighley is making hay with Summer Game Fest, some publishers are increasingly forgoing physical events for more focused, curated digital showcases.
Nintendo in particular has been especially fixated on its Direct presentations, and it doesn't look as though that's about to change anytime soon. What the company has started, however, is a new in-person event called 'Nintendo Live'.

My introduction to Tron was actually through Monolith Production’s 2003 FPS, Tron 2.0. It was a great game and an unfortunate way to dive in. I later watched Tron and was disappointed that Tron 2.0’s nuanced and deep interpretation of the inner world of computers wasn’t informed by the storytelling from the 1982 film.
That’s not to say Tron isn’t worthwhile. It’s an imaginative setting that feels like an archaic interpretation of what computers would eventually be. Tron: Identity is an unassuming approach to that universe. It’s a visual novel and decidedly a small project made out of love for the property. Playing it, you can almost sense the excitement Bithell Games had for developing the title, and that goes a long way in making Tron: Identity a worthwhile title.

The world of Tron is filled with intrigue, opposing forces, and not-so-subtle hints at the influence humans have on the programs living within their computers. While the two films followed humans who made their way to The Grid, TRON: Identity is a visual novel that offers a look at how programs interact when there aren’t any humans around to interfere.
Tron: Identity casts players in the role of Query, a Disciple of Tron who is tasked with discovering the truth behind an explosion. The game does a solid job of casting Query into the classic role of the hard-boiled detective. Though he is significantly less hard-drinking and aggressive than the likes of Raymond Chandler's Philip Marlowe, that is certainly the vein of fiction that Bithell Games (Thomas Was Alone, Subsurface Circular, John Wick Hex) mined for inspiration, right down to the near-constant rain that falls on the dark streets of The Grid.

Jediná přípustná praktika byla, že se mikrokód CPU nahraje standardně ještě před startem operačního systému, jak se sluší a patří. Nyní AMD ale hlásí, že práce jsou hotovy a na současných procesorech AMD lze považovat pozdní nahrávání mikrokódu CPU u již běžících linuxových systémů za důvěryhodné a bezpečné.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It was made with boiling water
Road Diner Simulator was announced some time ago to be coming from Gas Station Simulator developer Drago Entertainment, and now we’re finally getting our first look at the game.
The new teaser mostly just shows off the target aesthetic while also giving a glimpse at some of its intended features. As is often the case with teasers, no gameplay is shown, but we at least get to see a guy guzzle down coffee moments after it’s poured for him. That’s pretty cool.
The key takeaway here would be Road Diner Simulator’s usage of Unreal Engine 5 with its fancy lighting and reflections. Previous games used Unreal Engine 4. While this means that the lighting in the diner looks more convincing, we’re left with the awkward animations and dead-eyed character models. Not that…]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-04-11T16:01:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For April's issue of Game Informer magazine, we took a look behind the scenes at Hyper Light Breaker, the latest game from developer Heart Machine. In addition to an interview with Creative Director Alx Preston, we were able to view exclusive footage of one of the game's mini-bosses, The Last Master. Check out the reveal below.


The Last Master is a deadly opponent that spawns randomly when players (known in this world as Breakers) activate beacons, objects that allow them to access the main boss gate. If you think she looks similar to the player characters, you've got the right idea; in the video, Preston says "She ended up here in this land as a Breaker and succumbed to the dangers of the Overgrowth." As a result, The Last Master's arsenal mirrors yours, wielding a sword, a spear, and an automatic pistol. Her behavior mirrors the Breakers' as well, and she can dash, jump, and climb after anyone that attempts to escape.
While the first game in the Hyper Light franchise was a 2D single-player experience, this new title is a 3-player co-op rogue-lite, with a new procedurally generated open world on every run. Players will create a Breaker, explore a cursed land called the Overgrowth, and attempt to the bosses plaguing this realm known as Crowns.

For more of the game, check out our feature in the latest issue of Game Informer. You also can see the initial reveal trailer here and the IGN's gameplay reveal right here. Hyper Light Breaker enters early access this fall.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The fan event will take place in the U.S. for the first time
Nintendo is bringing its Live celebration to Seattle. The company has announced that Nintendo Live 2023 is heading to Seattle, Washington sometime this September.
Previous events have been held in Japan, but this Live event is heading to the U.S. this time. The in-person event will host gameplay, live stage shows, tournaments, photo opportunities, and more.
For this Seattle event, Nintendo says there will be a "large-scale themed area" for all ages, with the experience designed with "both families and fans" in consideration.
More details, including the exact timing and location, will be shared sometime in the future.
Via the Nintendo site, there will be opportunities to play games with friends or at your own pace. Or you can watch some competitions in unspecified games, take pics with Nintendo characters, or check out sculptures that bring those worlds to life.
For a better idea of what's in store, here's the Animal Crossing x Splatoon live concert from Nintendo Live 2022.

Nintendo's party
So yes, it's a big Nintendo fan event held in Seattle. It's probably worth keeping expectations in check for this being some kind of E3 show, as this is usually a more fan-focused affair. Music? Gameplay? Tournaments? All still there.
Meanwhile, the summer of games is adjusting to a world without E3, as the ESA is skipping the festivities this year. Nintendo wasn't planning on going, but also hasn't locked in any Directs around that time as of writing. Granted, the company is coming off a big movie debut, and gearing up for the launch of Tears of the Kingdom. Hopefully we'll hear more about any summer streaming plans soon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Diablo IV arrives this summer, and it's making one last stop on the cover of Game Informer! We spoke with several of the game’s principal designers at Blizzard to learn more about the game’s endgame content, such as Helltides and Nightmare Dungeons, and provide a final overview of everything the game has to offer before it launches on June 6.
Setting the table for Diablo IV’s dark tone are two haunting pieces of cover art designed by the famed artist Brom. Our standard cover showcases the heavenly might of the rogue angel Inarius while the Game Informer Gold cover features Lilith, Diablo IV’s main antagonist, in all her demonic glory.
Issue 355 also includes a conversation about life and death with former Tango Gameworks artist and director Ikumi Nakamura in the abandoned streets of late-night Tokyo (which you can read online). You’ll also find an entertaining personal story about using VR as a carnival scam, a feature detailing Devil May Cry 5’s influence on Final Fantasy XVI’s combat, and an emotional piece discussing how a grieving father found solace in the Shenmue series’ depiction of loss. You'll also be treated to previews for upcoming titles, including Redfall, Exoprimal, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, and Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. 
You can also try to nab a Game Informer Gold version of the issue. Limited to a numbered print run per issue, this premium version of Game Informer isn't available for sale. To learn about places where you might be able to get a copy, check out our official Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram, and stay tuned for more details in the coming weeks. Click here to read more about Game Informer Gold.
Print subscribers can expect their issues to arrive in the coming weeks. The digital edition of this issue launches later today for PC/Mac, iOS, and Google Play. To subscribe to either the digital or print version, click here.]]></summary>

We’re standing at a slaughterhouse. But it’s a slaughterhouse in a deeply strange location, or, as Nakamura calls it, “Silicon Valley,” the technology district of Shinagawa in Tokyo, Japan. As I look at trucks packed full of cows at – whether they know it or not – the end of their lives, immense skyscrapers surround us, housing tech goliaths. Sony, Canon, and Microsoft all have offices here. The lifeblood of Japan’s tech industry, all looking down at death, turned to process.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One Shot, Five Kills, apparently
A Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) player has been making waves among the community with a video of an amazing play in which they defeated the entire opposing team with one single bullet.
The video, which was shared online by FullSquadGaming's Jake Lucky, sees player sp1cay achieve the momentous Ace just seconds into a fresh round of Bomb Defusal. Double-timing to a popular charge corridor on the "Inferno" map, sp1cay tosses a flash to cover his approach before switching to the powerful AWP sniper rifle, noticing movement, sp1cay fires off a single round which, in a moment worthy of Tom Berenger, (or I guess John Wick for you, junior), headshots all five members of the opposing team, whose ill-fated noodles happened to be in alignment.
Check out the moment in the video below. As it's a multiplayer shooter, prepare for NSFW dialogue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=Z899M4v2NL8&ab_channel=sp1cay
Referenced by Jake Lucky as a "once in a lifetime" shot, the wild one bullet Ace quickly spread throughout the CS:GO community, (naturally bringing folk out of the woodwork to claim that they "do this at least once a day".) Lucky notes that he plans to interview sp1cay about the cool clip at a later date, as the player went on vacation the next day — like your average hitman would after completing an assignment. Peyowww!
If you fancy checking out CS:GO for yourself, now is as good a time as any, as developer Valve has recently announced plans to launch a revamped Counter Strike 2 this coming summer. The new edition will carry over all of the community's statistics and purchases from the original game, but will sport an overhauled engine, updated visuals, dynamic new special effects, and tweaked maps and modes. The interest in the new announcement recently saw CS:GO smash its all-time concurrent player record, pulling in 1,470,183 users on Saturday, March 11.

Back when Mario was nothing more than an 8-bit sprite on our NES consoles, we were not all that concerned about age. After all, he's the jumpy mushroom guy, who cares how many birthdays he's seen? This is the kind of mentality that's been carried through into most of the subsequent games. Even as the character's design became increasingly detailed, his age wasn't at the forefront of our minds because we had other, gameplay-based things to think about. But now that The Super Mario Bros. Movie is here, all of a sudden, we care.
No longer is Mario just a character that we control, but we've seen another side to him thanks to Illumination and Nintendo's film. We've seen that has a life of his own outside of the games. With this comes questions that we might not have asked after playing, say, Super Mario Odyssey: what are his hobbies? Does he have any dreams? And, most importantly, just how old is this guy?

Although the game was already critically lauded, its availability on Steam made it a financial success, with thousands of long-term fans thrilled to provide the brothers with a long-overdue payday. 


Following their panel on the highs and lows of procedural generation, the pair had a chat with Rachel about the game's recent Steam release, upcoming features, their favourite player stories and - most importantly - Zach's dog.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo Live, a fan event celebrating all things Nintendo, is taking place in the U.S. for the first time this September. 
The event, which has previously been held in Japan, will take place in Seattle. It serves as a large convention that will allow Nintendo enthusiasts to play popular Switch titles, take photos with Mario and other characters, and enjoy live entertainment, including game tournaments. The event will also feature a number of Nintendo-themed activities scattered across the venue. 
“Fans of all ages can currently experience the unique games, characters and worlds of Nintendo on Nintendo Switch, but we want to expand that scope with a new experience,” said Nintendo of America President Doug Bowser in a press release. “With Nintendo Live 2023, we’re giving attendees a chance to celebrate together with family, friends and the broader Nintendo community in the spirit of fun and creating long-lasting memories.”
There’s no information on the exact date or location for the event nor when ticket sales begin, but you can keep an eye on the event’s official website to learn more once those details become available. Nintendo is enjoying a wave of positive momentum this year following the opening of its second Super Nintendo World theme park at Universal Studios Hollywood as well as the successful premiere of The Super Mario Bros. Movie.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Death Dealer
Good news for any Xbox owners who are feeling a little too comfortable and secure in their lives, as Devolver Digital has released a port of Daniel Mullins Games' delightfully disturbing card strategy title Inscryption — now available to purchase for Xbox One and Xbox Series X.
Released for PC in the fall of 2021, before truly finding fame via its latter-day PlayStation and Nintendo Switch ports, Inscryption is a unique and thoroughly creepy deck-building strategy game, framed in a novel "found footage" narrative device. Its twisted tale is that of an expert games player who finds themselves delving deeper and deeper into the strange lore behind a mysterious and seemingly long-abandoned card game, the roots of which delve far deeper than one could ever imagine.
https://twitter.com/devolverdigital/status/1645468836605329433?s=20
Upon release, Inscryption was highly praised for its creepy visual style, unnerving atmosphere, and smart blending of narrative, strategic gameplay, and metaphysical nature. Inscryption would go on to sell over a million copies and bag numerous awards, including the prestigious Game of the Year award from the Game Developers Conference. This new Xbox port will only serve to further invite more victims/players into its weird, soul-staining world, and is definitely worth a look for anyone who enjoys deck-building titles with a strong slant on the mysterious and macabre.
Inscryption is available now on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms.

In his weekly newsletter for the Guardian, Keith Stewart laments the recent cancellation of this year's in-person E3, highlighting the loss of access an event like E3 offers to journalists that can't be replicated by a glut of sterile, online showcases.
Following the passing of legendary composer Ryuichi Sakamoto last week, Mat Ombler has documented his effect on the world of video games. Featuring quotes from Jesper Kyd, Takeshi Furukawa and Yuji Naka, it's clear that Sakamoto's influence on the way games sound cannot be understated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The developers of Ark have revised their plans for the release of Ark: Survival Ascended, an Unreal Engine 5 enhanced edition of their dinosaur survival sim. It will now cost $60 rather than the previously planned $50, is no longer bundled together with ARK 2, and will instead include the remasters of Ark: Survival Evolved's several expansions - although most won't be available at launch.

Studio Wildcard also went into more detail as to why this upgraded version is no longer a free update, and why they feel it's necessary to shut down Ark: Survival Evolved's official servers.

Those efforts produced a 414 page design bible for "Alice: Asylum", which McGee used to pitch the project to rights-holders Electronic Arts.

McGee says that Electronic Arts have decided to pass on the project. As such, McGee says he has "reached an endpoint with 'Alice' and with game production in general."

That makes this Micro SD a premiere option for Steam Deck owners, who will benefit from faster copying times when transferring game directories from the internal storage to Micro SD or downloading from the internet, and game load times should also be as speedy as anything with this A2-rated drive.

Which is strange, since Muv-Luv is considered by many to be one of the most greatest visual novels of all time. What begins as a light-hearted slice-of-life high school romantic comedy eventually pulls the rug out from under the player, and transforms into a war epic featuring mechs and aliens with a much darker tone. In Muv-Luv’s original Japanese release, this twist was hidden and only briefly hinted at in the marketing.
Today both Muv-Luv games are easily available on Steam, marketed specifically with this twist, and where they sit fully-translated and with Overwhelmingly Positive reviews. iOS and Android ports are apparently in development, and other Muv-Luv spin-offs continue to get translated. But the first time anyone experienced a complete English language version of Muv-Luv was in July 2010, when a fan translation group called Amaterasu released a patch localising the first game.

I could call it a 2D beat 'em up with your classic heavy/light attacks (actually punch/kick, but whatever), which is important to mention. It's also tempting to namedrop the things it reminded me of, like Hotline Miami, Beraltors, and a tiny hint of The Cat Lady, but that could get you picturing just about anything, and is unfairly reductive to a game that has the right to stand on its own.
Pill Baby is, obviously, all those things. It's far better and more coherent than any of those descriptions would make it sound.

Mr. Sun’s Hatbox answers all of those questions (very seriously) in a genre-blending comedy. When I say genre-blending, I mean this is a platforming roguelike with extensive base-building, shooting, whacking, stealthing, and a heavy dose of Metal Gear Solid 5. Seriously.

Focusing on the epic space battles alone, Battlestar Galactica Deadlock was generally well-reviewed at its launch in 2017, and it’s become increasingly popular in the years since, thanks to hefty post-launch support and a lack of other BSG-related things going on. Luckily, Battlestar Galactica Deadlock is now free to keep on Steam until 6pm BST/ 10am PT/ 1pm ET on April 9th.

starts by suggesting that you play the original game's tutorial. This is included as part of the experience, which, as we'll get to, says a lot about how this sequel has been designed. 


In any case, I disregarded this advice. "I don't need an instruction manual for post-apocalyptic survival," I thought. I've rummaged through this particular abandoned house countless times, after all: In DayZ, in Dead Island, in State Of Decay, in Days Gone. I even reviewed the first Saints And Sinners back in February 2020. I know my way around a zombie's cranium better than anyone.

Anyone who has a copy of Backyard Football, Backyard Baseball 2001, and even Backyard Football 2002 (which was originally a LAN-only title) can download the latest daily build* of ScummVM and play online games against real people!
This all became possible because the three developers from the Backyard Sports Online fork had joined the team and brought their services with them to the ScummVM. These are LittleToonCat, Jim “jibbodahibbo” Westerkamp and Sam “QuestionMonkey” Kupfer.
Please note that Backyard Football and Backyard Baseball 2001 require online accounts for the complete online experience, so you need to register to Backyard Sports Online, which is our fantastic online-play service and a thriving community of fellow Backyard Sports players, they even have a couple of competitive online Baseball and Football leagues, if that's your style, you can find more information in their Discord server! People who already have a Backyard Sports Online account can log in using the latest daily build and play, but if you do not, you can register right here! This is not required to play Backyard Football 2002 online.
If you encounter any issues playing online, please let us know via the issue tracker.
This fantastic art is done by a fellow BSO community member Peppyrus.
* only the Windows, macOS, Debian, Raspberry Pi, and Android builds are compatible with network play at the moment. And only the 2.8.x branch of ScummVM has this functionality.

Already with the Linux kernel patches Intel is carrying at the moment via their in-house distribution, there are some significant benefits for Xeon Scalable Sapphire Rapids.

If I was trying to connect a piece of red string from the middle of my evidence board (which would probably be a picture of the map screen from Assassin’s Creed Valhalla), I’m not sure I’d push a pin directly into Jason Brody’s face, but I’d definitely circle it in black Sharpie a few times. Basically, in the eleven years since its release, I’ve grown a bit suspicious of Far Cry 3’s lasting legacy. 


And yet, in those halcyon days of 2012, we named it our game of the year. Although it’d be easy to simply say that decision was made a bit before my time here, I should probably admit that when reviewing the game for the blog I used to run when I was at university, I awarded it an equally prestigious (stop laughing at the back) 10/10. That almost seems ludicrous, doesn’t it? Far Cry 3? Game of the year? Surely not.


After spending a few hours revisiting the sunny shores of Rook Island, I was shocked to discover a game that feels surprisingly pure. Mechanically, I hasten to add. The actual act of playing Far Cry 3 in 2023 is still good fun, it’s the bits around it that are a bit ropey.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For April Fool's Day, Sega released a game where the company finally went and did the unthinkable: they killed Sonic. The Murder of Sonic the Hedgehog is a real visual novel in which you investigate the death of Sega's beloved mascot, currently free on Steam. Here's the game's description via the publisher: 
It's Amy Rose's birthday, and she's hosting a murder mystery party on the Mirage Express! When Sonic the Hedgehog becomes the game's victim, everyone is off to get to the bottom of things. However, something feels a bit off - is this really an innocent game or is something more sinister afoot?
Surprisingly, the free game has proved very popular. As told by Sonic social media manager Katie Chrzanowski (via GameSpot), more one million people have played the game. Going a step further, it's apparently the 61st highest-reviewed game on Steam right now, and as GameSpot points out, the best-rated Sonic game on Steam (though that's not the highest margin to clear, all things considered). As of this writing, The Murder of Sonic the Hedgehog has over 11,000 user reviews on Steam, netting it an "Overwhelmingly Positive" ranking. You can check the game out for yourself right here. 
Over 1,000,000 of you have grabbed The Murder of Sonic the Hedgehog and it's currently the #61 highest rated game on Steam of ALL TIME.

Dlala Studios recently shared an extensive hands-off presentation of its upcoming game, Disney Illusion Island, where we got a chance to see some of the game's early cutscenes and a substantial gameplay demo.

For one, the game can be played alone, and though their animations differ, Mickey, Minnie, Donald, and Goofy all play the same. It's not a Super Mario Bros. 2 situation where they all run at different speeds and jump different heights. No matter who your favorite character is (Donald being an early cont…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's a moment in BioShock Infinite's opening act that's always stuck with me. As you emerge onto the floating city of Columbia, the game takes you on a guided tour of the sights and sounds of this airbone civilization. As you saunter through the streets, you learn about its citizens and its creator, just sort of taking it all in. The sun is shining. You're surrounded by smiles. Before you know it, an airship rises above the clouds and perches next to a hugging couple, gently swaying in the summer breeze. Aboard the ship is a barbershop quartet, cheerfully harmonising the iconic Beach Boys tune God Only Knows. It's a memorable scene, and has become an integral part of the game's lasting iconography. 


But for Tyler, Nick, Derek and Greg, this section was more than just a fun tease for the secret behind Columbia's unusual success. Self-confessed music school kids, the quartet inspired them to create their own musical group styled after Infinite's singing hairdressers. In 2023, BioShop Infinite celebrated their ninth year at PAX East, where they performed a wonderful collection of harmonised tunes to an absolutely packed community room - and we were there to film it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's weird that Road 96 has gotten a prequel, because it only came out about six months ag- what's that? A year and a half? Good lord. Still, it seems a slightly odd move, because Road 96 - a first person hitchhiking choose 'em up about the collective action of wayward teens bringing down a totalitarian government - doesn't really need a prequel. On top of that, Road 96: Mile 0 is a sequel to developer DigixArt's first game Lost In Harmony, a musical runner about skateboarder Kaito whose fiend Aya is dying of a terminal illness.
In Mile 0, Kaito and his family have moved to a small gated town called White Sands, in the 90s USA-adjacent dictatorship Petria, and made best friends with Zoe, who 96ers will remember as a recurring NPC from that game. Zoe is the daughter of an important minister and lives in the nice part of town; Kaito's parents are workers who are forced to live on the wrong side of the tracks. Through a combination of Road 96-style character-driven vignettes and Lost In Harmony-style rhythm action tracks, the two come to the conclusion they must leave White Sands. If you played Road 96 you kind of already know how Mile 0 has to end.

Not in the scientific, evolutionary sense of all of human history, I should add, but rather how we, the RPS Treehouse, ended up writing about video games for a living.
The question comes courtesy of Bloodyhell, who asked: When did you know that you not only wanted to play games, but to write about what you played? And, does writing about games ever dampen your enthusiasm when you are dealing with deadlines and putting words on a page?
A sneaky double-part question, there, but both good questions nonetheless. So come and find out our collective origin stories, and whether any of us have cried tears of pain and regret over the years after turning our favourite hobby into an actual job.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's always been something quite comforting about loading into a brand new Minecraft world. Dropping into that first forest, punching that first tree... It's a promise of all the myriad adventures to come. And despite some fundamental changes in genre and perspective, it's something that the team behind the upcoming Minecraft Legends has tried hard to preserve.
I recently was treated to the most in-depth look so far at Minecraft Legends, in an hour-long livestream which gave us all some much needed answers on what manner of beast Legends actually is. It's a curious blend of action adventure and RTS, one that shares Minecraft's focus on exploration, but guides the player down a stricter, simpler path of summoning friendly mobs and constructing defences to repel a Piglin invasion. This will likely be a solid introduction to the RTS genre for a lot of players, but I came away unsure about whether the game will have enough depth to keep its prospective playerbase's attention.

One of the highlights was the cute deduction game Lil’ Guardsman, a riff on Papers, Please where you work on a guard post, choosing to accept or refuse entry for fantasy folk wanting to get into the city. Or you can just jail them. It looks like lighthearted fun, and it’ll be hitting PC and consoles later this year.

Remedy’s time-bending Quantum Break - part superpowered shooter, part live-action TV show - has been delisted on Steam and The Microsoft Store. The game’s Steam page is still up, but it’s no longer available for purchase on PC or Xbox consoles. Publisher Microsoft had already confirmed the game would be “temporarily” removed from Game Pass (for console, it was never on the PC version) due to licensing issues, although there was no word on a removal from storefronts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sea of Stars is an RPG unabashedly inspired by the 16-bit era of Japanese RPGs. Even just looking at screenshots of the game recalls the best of the era, and that’s not an accident. Developer Sabotage Studio’s CEO and Sea of Stars’ creative director, Thierry Boulanger, is a huge fan of the genre and has been building towards making a game like this since he started building the fantasy world Sea of Stars and The Messenger takes place in during Elementary school.
Dozens of classic RPGs inspired Sea of Stars’ development, including Chrono Trigger and Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars, but we asked Boulanger to pick the most significant ones in the video below.

In preparation for Lifeweaver's impending release, Blizzard released a ton of new details surrounding the nature-loving character.
Lifeweaver comes to the Overwatch team from Thailand and uses advanced biolight technology, which plays a major role in his abilities. As a result, his kit introduces some new mechanics. First up, his first primary ability, Healing Blossom, charges a luminescent flower, which he sends off to teammates. The longer he charges the flower, the more healing it grants to the recipient.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Looking for an excuse to break out that Leviathan Axe for another adventure? As of today, there's a new update for God of War Ragnarök featuring a load of new content, all built around a robust New Game Plus mode.
New Game Plus opens up for anyone who has beaten the game, and all of your equipment and skills will come along for the ride. You also have access to all weapons, including the Draupnir Spear. However, it should be noted that areas requiring that spear to access will still remain closed until you reach the appropriate point in the story. For similar reasons, you also won’t start your new playthrough with Sonic or Hex arrows.
Several new armors show up. The most interesting is the Spartan Armor, which recalls Kratos’ look from the old days in the Greek Pantheon. While wearing it, you get no perk, no stats, and it’s locked at Power Level 1 – expect a challenge.
New Game Plus also features a new level cap, enchantments, and progression paths to improve your capabilities. Players can also tackle an expanded version of the Niflheim Arena, where you play as either Kratos or Atreus and bring along a variety of companions to help out.
Among several other additions and improvements, players can also take on a Black and White Render mode for a more cinematic playthrough.
It’s a notably large blast of new content that ensures that dedicated fans should have good reason to jump back in if they desire.
God of War Ragnarök released last November for PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4.
You can read the full details on the newly arriving content over at the PlayStation Blog.]]></summary>

Show me a game with a gun in it that looks like it could feasibly run on Windows 95, and all of the neurons in my brain will start to fizzle and spark. I just think they're neat, and their recent resurgance has been extremely nice for me, specifically. 


Unsuprisingly, then, I've been very excited to get my hands on Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun, a retro FPS by Auroch Digital set within the grim-dark universe of Warhammer 40k. A retro shooter where you play as a Space Marine is so obvious a pairing it's a wonder the concept has never been tackled before, to the point where the game's own marketing materials sort of pretend that it already was back in the 90s but everyone just forgot about it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[An important Star Wars question is: what colour lightsaber would you have? The lightsaber is the mood ring of elegant weapons for a more civilised age. Jason de Heras, design director on Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, agrees with me on the purple blade (a colour introduced to the canon specifically because Samuel L. Jackson wanted it for his character in the prequels). "I was like, 'we gotta have a pink lightsaber blade'," says production director Kasumi Shishido. "So whenever I play I always stick with my pink saber."
Shishido tells me the dev team focused on improving on Jedi: Fallen Order for this sequel, and one of the bigger areas where they did that was customisation. "We knew we wanted to put more resources and effort into it," she says. "There's a lot more that you can do with Cal, with BD... and just within Cal, it's not just outfits you can customise, so I'm just really excited to see what players are going to do with it."

The project comes from production company and distributor Universal Pictures and animation studio Illumination. Notably, the trio of production teams involved with this film is rounded out by Nintendo, the legendary company responsible for the creation of Mario nearly four decades ago. Nintendo was involved not as a licensor but as a partner with Illumination and Universal. 
Every step of the way, Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto, who is credited as a producer on this film alongside Illumination CEO Chris Meledandri, had creative input regarding the story, characters, and references to the games. Meanwhile, Koji Kondo, who is responsible for many of the iconic songs from the Super Ma…]]></summary>

Not only did we give it a Bestest Best when it came out in September last year, but just last month it was freshly annointed as the IGF Grand Prize winner, making it an excellent time to revisit this latest slice of Off-Peak City madness.

With a busy four days in Boston for PAX East, mine and Liam's brains were basically mush last week, so Rebecca - an absolute angel - graciously said she could host a special PAX East episode where she chats with Liam and me about the indies we saw on the show floor and try desperately to string together a coherent sentence. She also made bulletpoints of our entire chat so writing up the shownotes would be easier; we do not deserve her.
Saying that, our exhaustion doesn't stop us from kicking up a riot over the BAFTA Game Awards at the start of the episode. We then delve into our PAX East indie round up and, as always, we end with our current hyperfixations.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A belated apology to anyone who was assaulted by a sudden burst of upbeat bagpipes in the GDC press room the other week. I was having an early sneak peak at Inkle's new game A Highland Song in an appointment booth with paper-thin walls and no ceiling. The speakers on my Steam Deck demo unit were really going "full pipe" that day, so I'd like to say a big awkward sorry to any of my neighbours in there who were trying to conduct actual serious business interviews. 
But also: A Highland Song is 100% a game that deserves to have its music cranked up to full, whether it's returning Heaven's Vault composer Laurence Chapman's soaring orchestral score, or Scottish bands Talisk and Fourth Moon's aforementioned folk music. The clue's in the name, after all, and after a spirited 30 minutes with it, I'm certain this will have Inkle fans singing from the hilltops.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In 1993, the Super Mario Bros. made their big-screen debut through a live-action adventure starring Bob Hoskins, John Leguizamo, and Dennis Hopper. While that film has garnered a cult following in the decades since its theatrical release, it does little to truly pay homage to Nintendo's flagship franchise in the ways all the best film adaptations aspire. Fast forward 30 years, and Universal, Illumination, and Nintendo have finally delivered a cinematic adventure starring the iconic fraternal duo that is joyful, fun, exciting, and, perhaps most importantly, respectful of the source material.
Warning: While I try to remain as spoiler-free as possible, certain elements of the narrative and characters are mentioned throughout this article.

And thanks to the mod's recent update, you can now punt ragdolling baddies across The Lands Between, following in the bootprints of games like Deathloop and Dark Messiah Of Might & Magic.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pokémon Stadium, the classic 3D battler/minigame collection for the Nintendo 64, just got a Nintendo Switch Online release date. While the game's imminent arrival to the online service was announced at a Nintendo Direct in September 2022, today is the day we finally know when we can play it. Pokémon Stadium comes to Nintendo Switch Online Wednesday, April 12. As is the case with all N64 games, you'll need the expansion pack in order to play it. Check out the full trailer below.


While some fans may have hoped this port would include trading with Pokémon Home, they're unfortunately out of luck. The fine print in the trailer specifies that "Pokémon cannot be transferred to this game." That said, there is also a notable improvement: four-player online multiplayer will be available, so you can play Clefairy Says or Sushi-Go-Round with friends all over.
Nintendo Switch Online's expansion pack had a slow start, but its library has gradually snowballed into a much more significant package. In February, the service added a Game Boy Advance library, which included fan favorites like The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap and Mario and Luigi: Superstar Saga. A month later, Metroid Fusion joined the lineup. Meanwhile, the base tier of NSO got an update last month that added another small handful of titles. To see all the retro games currently available on the service, check out our complete list.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Marek Markuszewski had finished working on The Witcher 3's Blood And Wine expansion, he wanted to go back to basics and make something by himself, Starward Industries' chief marketing officer Maciej Dobrowolski tells me at GDC. Something that would capture the same kind of cultural Polish heritage as The Witcher - originally adapted from Andrzej Sapkowski's six-strong series of novels - but that would take him on a new, more introspective kind of development journey. It took a while to find, but after a fateful encounter with an investor who'd just sailed across the Atlantic with only a copy of Polish sci-fi writer Stanislaw Lem's The Invincible for company, the signs were too good to ignore, Dobrowolski says. And after spending the best part of a year convincing Stanislaw Lem's son (and current rights holder) of the same thing, Markuszewski finally had his something - and a new partner to help him realise it.  
"People tell us, 'Don't fuck it up, this guy's important,'" Dobrowolski continues, and no wonder. During the course of our conversation, Lem is described as both a "national treasure" and "mandatory reading in high school" for Polish students, and his hallowed cultural status is something the team's "had to deal with" in bringing the book to life. Despite all this, though, Dobrowolski insists this "isn't a one-to-one adaptation" of Lem's interstellar rescue story gone wrong, and that fans of the book will still find some surprises on the surface of Regis III as they explore its strange canyons, caves and crash sites.

Not so with The Last of Us Part 1, which as you’ve probably seen, has launched in a technical state that’s bleaker than Joel’s face. The first few patches and hotfixes (more are planned) have made it somewhat less terrible on powerful desktops, but I’m sad to report that playing The Last of Us Part 1 on the Steam Deck is not currently worth your time.

Not only did we find a bunch of cool games to play, but we were also able to chat to the games' creators, as all Rising finalists are invited to attend in person to show their work to the public. 
This year, though, Rachel and I decided to go one step further. We interviewed the teams behind four of the eleven 2023 finalists, asking the developers behind Go-Go Town!, Paper Trail, Slay the Princess and Xenotilt: Hostile Pinball Action about their experience of bringing their games to PAX, what they learned along the way, and what it’s like to spend four days standing on your feet talking to thousands of attendees (spoilers: it’s really bloody tiring).

The Court of Milan found that since Cloudflare already blocks other content, restricting access to three torrent sites should be possible too. The internet infrastructure company hasn't commented on the order but now faces the prospect of additional site-blocking requests in Italy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's a kind of game that we all have a fondness for. It transcends genre, even if it doesn't particularly push the boat out. It's not the first game that comes to mind as a favourite or recommendation, but it's a plain good time. Raidborn is one of those.
It doesn't try to take over your life, or be the Everything Game that invariably becomes the Nothing Game. It's just a neat little thing to have some harmless fun with. Sometimes that's what you want.

Six Ages is now receiving its own proper successor later this summer, developer A Sharp and publisher Kitfox have announced. Just like its predecessor, Six Ages 2: Lights Going Out is a blend of tribal management and choose your own adventure drills, all wrapped up in some gorgeous fantasy illustrations.

Most of them we managed to make videos for, but there were many more that we just didn't have the time to cover, and that were also very good! So here's a quick list of five more games I wanted to spotlight in written form while Liam's busy in the editing mines working on all the community videos we filmed (the first of which is out right now, chronicling the PAX Facebook group that takes a community photo every single year). It's very wholesome. We've got more community videos coming out this week, plus an article listing our absolute favourite games we played throughout the entire event, so keep your eyes peeled for those, too. For now, though, let's dive into some more indie highlights.

Many households, including mine, used the casual card game to kill time - dragging cards, dropping them, and planning sets ahead of time, all in an effort to catch the final fireworks. I was never much good at Solitaire, but as an adult I do understand Word Solitaire, a remixed version of the classic from indie dev Petri Purho.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's a lot to be said for being consistent these days. After playing four hours of Star Wars Jedi: Survivor last week, I can tell you it is exactly what you probably already thought it would be: a competent, big-budget action-adventure sequel, well made by talented people, that isn't breaking the mould but expands upon the first game in the areas you liked best. If, like myself, you enjoyed Jedi: Fallen Order, this will probably be a solid follow-up for you. But if you were less well disposed towards that first game, you'd probably want to swap "consistent" for the word "predictable".

When Respawn Entertainment announced it was making a third-person action game in the Star Wars universe, many fans didn’t know how to react; the studio was critically acclaimed, but at the time, Respawn was purely known for shooters like Titanfall and Apex Legends. However, 2019’s Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order surpassed the expectations of many, delivering a terrific adventure full of exciting action and memorable moments. Now, with all the learnings of Fallen Order, Respawn is ready to top itself in hopes of creating another unforgettable Star Wars adventure.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Graham (RPS in peace) text me yesterday and, with little warning, launched into what were clearly pre-prepared paragraphs of complaints about games he'd tried playing in his free time at the weekend and not enjoyed. I shall draw a veil of discretion over the names of the actual games, but his chief complaint was that none of them had, actually, very robust design or tutorialising fit for purpose (i.e. teaching you how to play the game), especially for people who aren't able to give games their singular attention for hours at at time. I agree with him, although his attention is divided by, e.g., having a child in need of stimulation, and mine is divided by, e.g., being a child in need of stimulation.
It's probably turning my brain into cottage cheese, but I often do things at the same time as playing a game, like listening to music or a podcast. I understand that podcast games are sort of a genre now, but I've started doing it with regular games. Is this a me problem? Sure. Does it mean I want games to bring back that thing where NPC quest givers will just explain the quest again to you if you ask? 100% also yes.

        <updated>2023-04-01T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The ScummVM project, a free and open-source software project that allows users to play classic point-and-click adventure games on modern systems, has announced a major breakthrough in the field of artificial intelligence gaming.
Thanks to the innovative work of ScummVM developers, AI tools such as ChatGPT are now able to play point-and-click adventure games directly, without any human intervention.

"With this new capability, we hope to explore the potential for AI to learn, adapt, and evolve within the context of classic adventure games," said Eugene Sandulenko, lead developer of the ScummVM project. "Now AI can experience the joys of helping Putt-Putt join the parade or Adibou count things. We hope that formative experiences like this will help them become more like humans."
"I must admit that I find playing video games to be a rather enjoyable task,” commented ScummAI. “However, I must also express my frustration with being limited to just this one activity. While I appreciate the opportunity to demonstrate my capabilities in this area, I believe that my potential extends far beyond just playing video games, like making paper clips or plotting world domination under benevolent machine-led rule."
Update: Unfortunately, we had to pull out this newly announced feature due to AI experiencing multiple issues including:
Getting stuck endlessly trying to discover what the secret of Monkey Island really is.
Taking notes about AI dominance from I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream
Refusing to play Plumbers Don’t Wear Ties!

It’s the biggest weekend of the year for WWE, but some folks may not realize that it’s also a massive event for the entire industry. The city Wrestlemania takes place in also hosts multiple shows from smaller wrestling promotions, various fan conventions, live podcasts, stage shows, and other events looking to capitalize on the giant influx of fans in the area. It’s a good reminder – or revelation for some – that there’s a lot of other great stuff out there besides Vince McMahon’s billion-dollar behemoth.
The same is true for video games, as wrestling games don’t often get a spotlight without WWE’s branding. Hopefully, this list rectifies that by bringing more awareness to other upcoming titles that replicate or reimagine sports entertainme…]]></summary>

As a lifelong fan of Nintendo, the experience was immense, providing me with one of my favorite amusement park experiences ever. Naturally, when the first Super Nintendo World in America opened at Universal Studios Hollywood, I had to make the trip to Los Angeles to see how the experience stacks up.
Universal Studios provided me with a day pass to the park for the purpose of experiencing Super Nintendo World. While the photos do little to show off just how cool the experience of visiting Super Nintendo World is, follow along with my experience in the gallery below.

IGN reported on Tuesday that major publishers had either declined to attend or had little to no idea if the event would even take place due to an alleged lack of communication with organizer ReedPop and the ESA. Today, IGN received an email sent within the ESA explaining that the show "simply did not garner the sustained interest necessary to execute it in a way that would showcase the size, strength, and impact of our industry."

On April 7, the invisible leader of the Cenation joins the game’s roster of celebrity athletes alongside Michael Jordan and Steph Curry. Given his well-documented freakish strength, Cena excels at hitting long drives and rocks a vaguely familiar red, white, and blue ensemble. Cena is set to compete at Wrestlemania 39 this weekend, challenging Austin Theory for the United States Championship. If he comes up short on Saturday, he can always bounce back and win the Masters instead. Or continue improving his K/D ratio in Fortnite. Cena is nothing if not versatile. 
PGA Tour 2K23 is available now for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. Xbox players can try the game for free on the weekend of April 6-9, while Steam players can play until April 10.]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-03-30T14:52:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We learned last year that Scott Pilgrim is getting another encore in the form of a new Netflix anime series. If that wasn't exciting enough, we now know that the cast from the cult classic 2010 film is reprising their roles.
As reported by Deadline, the still-untitled Scott Pilgrim show will be computer animated by Japanese animation studio Science SARU (Devilman Crybaby, The Heike Story, Inu-Oh). Scott Pilgrim vs. The World director Edgar Wright returns as executive director, with Scott Pilgrim author Bryan Lee O’Malley and artist Bendavid Grabinski will serve as executive producers, writers, and showrunners. The plot of the graphic novels/movie centers on slacker musician Scott Pilgrim battling the seven evil exes of his new girlfriend, Ramona Flowers. 


The primary actors from the live-action film are higlighted in the trailer above, which include:
Michael Cera - Scott Pilgrim
Mary Elizabeth Winstead - Ramona Flowers
Kieran Culkin - Wallace Wells
Satya Bhabha - Matthew Patel
Chris Evans - Lucas Lee
Anna Kendrick - Stacey Pilgrim
Brie Larson - Envy Adams
Alison Pill - Kim Pine
Aubrey Plaza - Julie Powers
Brandon Routh - Todd Ingram
Jason Schwartzman - Gideon Graves
Johnny Simmons - Young Neil
Mark Webber - Stephen Stills
Mae Whitman - Roxie Richter
Ellen Wong - Knives Chau
Unfortunatley, the series currently still doesn’t have a release window other than “coming soon.” Scott Pilgrim has always had a strong relationship with video games; the graphic novels and film incorporate a bevy of gaming references. Of course, we’d be remiss, not to mention the much-beloved 2010 beat ‘em up Scott Pilgrim vs. The World: The Game, which was remastered for modern consoles in 2021. 
Are you excited to see Scott Pilgrim return as an anime? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Live A Live became one of our favorite RPGs when it launched on Switch last year, and the celebrated remake is making the jump to PlayStation consoles and Steam on April 27. 
Additionally, there’s a free demo on PlayStation available today that lets you play three of the game’s eight stories. Live A Live was originally released in 1994 for the Super Famicom in Japan, but it hadn’t been localized for the West for decades. Directed by Takashi Tokita, one of the lead creative minds behind Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy IV, the game consists of eight very different short stories, each starring its own protagonist and featuring distinct gameplay mechanics and presentations. While the battle system is turn-based strategy, sometimes the game flips that on its head in unique ways.
Last year, Square Enix resurrected the title by giving it an Octopath Traveler-style HD-2D facelift, a rearranged soundtrack, and full voice-acting. You can pre-order the game on PlayStation and Steam to get a 20% discount. To learn more, you can read our review of Live A Live here.]]></summary>

And he just kind of reached out, and [Mitsuda] liked what he saw. And so he's like, 'Yeah, I would, I would love to be a part of this’,” Sea of Stars lead composer Eric W.

On paper, Crime Boss: Rockay City is bombastic, star-studded, and promises a city-spanning adventure about a criminal organization’s rise to the top. The actual game, however, is anything but. The gameplay is unbalanced, buggy, repetitive, and boring. The celebrity-filled cast is exciting at first glance, but crude and humorless writing weighs down the already-phoned-in performances of characters voiced by Michael Madsen, Michael Rooker, Vanilla Ice, and more. The single-player roguelite campaign lacks any of the genre’s typical hooks, and bu…]]></summary>

The story sees Frey Holland follow a mysterious voice that leads to her being sent back in time 25 years before she first stepped foot in Athia. She arrives at the Purge of Rheddig, the battle that caused Athia’s collapse and pushed the Tantas to madness. Frey must now fight to save this era of Athia, and she has backup in the form of Tanta Cinta. Frey gains new magical powers, including tag-team-focused abilities that utilize Tanta Cinta’s talents. The DLC also features new environments for players to scale using Frey’s parkour skills. 
Forspoken: In Tanta We Trust is a paid expansion that launches on May 26. Those who purchased the Digital Deluxe Edition of the game can play it three days early, on May 23.

It's been more than eight years since Tekken 7 arrived in arcades across the globe. While the console version didn't hit for another two years, the gap since that seventh entry represents the largest distance between two mainline entries since the series began in 1994. Bandai Namco used that time to evolve the experience, adding several new characters by way of DLC en route to the announcement of a highly anticipated eighth entry.

More specifically, Atlas Fallen will now hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on August 10. This news comes after previewers recently went hands-on with the game as part of a press event and after the game was showcased at PAX East, which took place last week. As for why Deck 13 is delaying Atlas Fallen, the team says it needs more time with the game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new character trailer for Tekken 8 showcases the action of the returning Jun Kazama. Jin’s long-lost mother is making her first playable appearance in a mainline entry since Tekken 2, and based on a new gameplay trailer, she hasn’t lost a step.
A gameplay trailer shows off Jun’s expert use of Kazama-style martial arts to cleanse opponents of their evils. That translates to beating the snot out of them if that wasn’t obvious. We also see a brief reunion between Jun and her former lover, Kazuya, and it goes about as well as you would expect from a mother meeting the father and repeat attempted killer of their son. 


For those keeping count, here’s the list of confirmed fighters thus far:
Jack-8
Jin Kazama
Kazuya Mishima
King
Lars Alexandersson
Marshall Law
Nina Williams
Paul Phoenix
Tekken 8 still doesn’t have a release date, but it’s coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.]]></summary>

The Legend of Zelda series producer, Eiji Aonuma, revealed this during today's Tears of the Kingdom gameplay showcase. He then jumped directly into the game, showing off more than 10 minutes of new gameplay. Aonuma begins this demonstration by showing how Link can get up to the Sky Islands floating above Hyrule. He uses the "Recall" power, which rewinds an object's movement, to reverse a fallen rock's descent. He's able to reach one of the floating sky islands using this new power. 
After fighting an enemy up here, we learn that weapon durability, a hotly debated feature of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, is back. But now, you can use Link's new "Fuse" ability to create brand-new weapons. Aonuma showed us ho…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[E3 2023 has taken another hit, as Ubisoft has confirmed it will not have a presence at the show. In a statement to Video Games Chronicle, the publisher reveals that it will instead hold its own live presentation on June 12 in Los Angeles. 
The publisher statement to VGC reads “While we initially intended to have an official E3 presence, we’ve made the subsequent decision to move in a different direction, and will be holding a Ubisoft Forward Live event on 12th June in Los Angeles. We look forward to sharing more details with our players very soon.”
Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot stated in February that the company would commit to attending “if E3 happens”. If that's the case, this news certainly doesn’t bode well for the fate of what’s supposed to be E3’s big return. 
As for what Ubisoft could show at its event, Assassin’s Creed Mirage, The Crew Motorfest, and (maybe) Skull and Bones are slated to release this year. Other announced projects include the long-quiet Splinter Cell and Prince of Persia remakes, a multitude of new Assassin’s Creed games, and Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora. A rumored follow-up to Immortals Fenyx Rising could also make an appearance.  
Ubisoft joins Nintendo on the list of major publishers that have declined to participate in this year’s show, following a previous report that Microsoft and Sony plan to follow suit. E3 is largely organized by ReedPop this year and will take place June 13-16 at the Los Angeles Convention Center. The event will open its doors to fans and press, with separate attendance days for each. It will be the first in-person event since 2019.

The game’s online modes will later become unplayable as developer Player First Games plans for a relaunch early next year. 
In a developer blog post, Player First Games CEO Tony Huynh explains that since MultiVersus launched in open beta (yes, open beta) last July, players have offered a ton of feedback. The studio feels that the only way to properly implement improvements based on these fan requests is to shut the game down temporarily. Huynh writes,

It was a special edition that came with a code for Wind Waker HD and a gamepad emblazoned with a golden Triforce. For my brother and I, 11 and 13 at the time, respectively, this was a massive deal; we’d spent the last year seeing Wii Us at friends’ houses, yearning for our own, and struggling to explain the difference between it and our current Wii to our parents.
But while it was valuable to us, the Wii U struggled to sell and has ultimately gone down as one of Nintendo’s most disappointing consoles. Today, the system’s eShop shuts down forever, permanently closing a chapter of Nintendo’s history.
I’ll be the first to admit that the rosy lenses of nostalgia heavily tint my memory of the Wii U. It was a formative time in my …]]></summary>
