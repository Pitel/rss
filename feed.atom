        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Trickster is a rather unique Arisen-only vocation in Dragon’s Dogma 2. Rather than deal a lot of damage, you instead mostly buff your Pawns and flummox your enemies. You’re no doubt going to get it eventually, but this is how you get it directly.


You can’t get the Trickster vocation until you get to Battahl. If you continue to follow the main questline, you’ll eventually get to it through the quest Flickering Shadows. If you don’t want to wait, once you get to Battahl, just beeline it to the Reverent Shrine. 


There, you’ll meet Luz, who will teach you the vocation. For bonus points, go to the back of the shrine and climb to the roof. Move to the front of the shrine (above the front door) and you’ll find Luz there, in the flesh. She’ll teach you an additional move.


Using the Trickster Vocation


As I mentioned earlier, the Trickster vocation is less about doing damage and more about empowering your Pawns. It’s too bad this is an Arisen-only power, since this is exactly the sort thing I’d want a Pawn to do. In any case, many of the skills held by the Trickster either create illusions to confuse enemies (without attacking them), while others buff Pawns.


Tricksters wield a censer as a weapon, which is pretty far out. One of the more interesting abilities allows the player to create solid objects – specifically walls and bridges – using their censer.


Altogether, it’s a rather strange vocation that’s most useful to players who like to simply watch the combat unfold while gently altering the outcome. It’s, um, not for me. I like to be the one doing massive damage. However, if the Trickster sounds good to you, hopefully this guide helps.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CD Projekt Red is offering a free trial, not a demo, of Cyberpunk 2077 for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S owners. If you've not had the distinct pleasure of walking the streets of the vibrant and grimy Night City, then it might be time to surrender the next hundred or so hours to this maligned masterpiece.


New players, it's time to give Cyberpunk 2077 a try


The news came via Twitter by the official Cyberpunk 2077 account. Those who own either a PS5 or Xbox Series can experience five hours of playtime for free between March 28, 2024, at 11 a.m. ET through April 1, 2024, at 2:59 a.m. ET. Even better, once you've gotten a sweet taste of this digital ambrosia, you can jump right into the full game as progress in the free trial carries over.

Cyberpunk 2077 got off to a rocky start when it was released in 2020. It was largely unplayable on previous-generation consoles and littered with technical issues across all versions. In the comeback that all other struggling titles are now compared to, CD Projekt Red corrected course and turned the sci-fi thriller into something truly amazing through a litany of patches and updates.


I was one of those players who tried it when it first launched and was whelmed. Then, like so many others, I decided to give it another shot after watching Cyberpunk: Edgerunners, and I had that Frank Reynolds epiphany moment. I swear that anime was the best advertising for the game.


What followed was an intensive dive into an engrossing world full of unique and memorable characters. I was equally horrified, ecstatic, and obsessed with the various gigs available. Cyberpunk 2077 is a game where the main story is best left on the back burner while you take in everything else Night City has to offer. It's one of my all-time favorite games and if you've ever been remotely curious, you owe it to yourself to dive in during the free trial period.

The Tolled to Rest quest rewards the player with the Ancient Battleground Key. To find this mission, go to the pathway to the upper right of Checkpoint Rest Town.

Eventually, a man in red clothing will plead for help. Defeat all the monsters near him and talk to him to progress further in the mission. He enlists you to escort him to the Ancient Battleground, which isn't too far from your current position. If lost, use Oskar as a guide since he will often lead the way. 


On the second floor, Oskar rewards you with Dragon's Dogma 2's Ancient Battleground Key. A Nation's Death Knell grimoire also sits on the pedestal next to him.

The Ancient Battleground room presents several chests filled with treasure, and the rewards may fluctuate depending on the playthrough. You can also use a shortcut as an exit by removing the plank from the doorway on the first floor.

        <updated>2024-03-25T19:23:09.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fighting enemies in Dragon's Dogma 2 without locking on to them can be a great way to attack without restrictions. However, if you find that it's difficult to aim your attacks or that some assistance would help your progression, knowing how to lock on to enemies and auto-aim can help.


Can you lock on to enemies in Dragon's Dogma 2?


In Dragon's Dogma 2, the only way to lock on to enemies while fighting in combat is to use vocation skills like Sorcerer and Mage spells or attacks from classes like Magick Archers. When you cast a spell, a circle will appear on an enemy, locking you onto them as you perform your incantation. If you have a melee character, you won't lock on to monsters, requiring you to time and aim your attacks.


Screenshot by Destructoid


To activate the Sorcerer and Mage spell circle, you'll start your incantation and aim your camera toward your enemy. If it's a small monster, the circle covers its entire body, indicating you're attacking it. For larger enemies like Cyclops and Ogres, you can target its legs, head, and other parts to focus on its weak points. However, since switching targets is challenging, you'll still have to rely on character positioning to get the exact angle you need. 


Outside of this, several other vocations, particularly melee ones, have no lock-on abilities. Although some skills for various vocations have similar mechanics, you'll mostly rely on your aim and timing when attacking and blocking. This also doesn't apply to Pawns and their vocations, as they automatically fight for you regardless and require little to no intervention on your part.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[No matter the industry – sports, television, movies, or games – the debate of "the greatest of all time" inevitably comes up. These debates are often full of superfluous apples-to-oranges comparisons and, as a result, are unlikely to come up with a definitive answer everyone will be happy with. But that's what makes them so fun. In that spirit, we're taking the month of March to hold our own bracket-style tournament, voted on by readers, to determine the greatest video game of all time.
Though we here at Game Informer assembled the bracket, even that was heavily influenced by our Reader Vote we held in 2018 to coincide with our 300th issue. Using the results of our 2018 Reader Vote combined with some input from staff, general sentiment in various online communities, and critical reception for more recent games, we assembled a starting bracket of 64 games. From here, we'll hold two rounds of voting per week until we whittle this field down to one ultimate winner.
Will this result in a definitive selection of the best game ever released? Or will it reveal a coordinated effort from a particular gaming community committed to seeing their favorite game rise through the ranks? Only time will tell. 
While this is meant to be a fun experiment to see how the results shake out within the Game Informer readership and community, we hope you'll come back to root for your favorites every Monday and Thursday until we are able to crown our champion in the 2024 Game Gauntlet. Be sure to bookmark this page or follow us on social media to be alerted when a new round starts!

Spellbound is started north of Melve in an easy-to-miss cabin called Eini’s House. Pay it a visit, and you’ll meet Trysha, who is despondent over the fact that her Grandmother won’t teach her magick. Instead, she turns to you. She asks you to find her 5 magical tomes that she can learn from.


Note that Trysha will not talk to you if there’s a grandparent present. To solve this issue, I simply picked up her grandfather, hauled him out of the house, dropped him a few feet away, and then went back and spoke to Trysha. Problem solved.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dragon's Dogma 2 is finally out and I'm betting that Capcom's new big thing will likely be the most talked-about game for a while. One of the things making this a one-of-a-kind experience is its "Pawn System", whose mechanics I delve into right here. 


But if you're less concerned about the technical aspects and more interested in learning what pawns represent in the game's lore, then you've come to the right place. Let's learn what's at the heart of a pawn in Dragon's Dogma.

Pawns in Dragon's Dogma lore


A pawn is a unique type of companion. Whereas other RPGs have characters with backstories and motivations joining our party, Dragon's Dogma comes as close as possible to a story-based game acknowledging the existence of bots. Though they look just like real human beings would and have their individual vocations, Pawns have no backstory or agency to speak of. 


Pawns are summons made by the Arisen, the person chosen by destiny to slay the dragon, to help them in their quest. A pawn's actions are always no more than the reflection of the Arisen's will. In the world of Dragon's Dogma, you can identify a pawn by looking at their hands, which will have a mark that matches the scar the dragon made on the Arisen's chest when their heart got ripped out — more on that here.


The Arisen gets to create one pawn of their own, but we'll still see many other pawns in the world of Dragon's Dogma and Dragon's Dogma 2. That's because we have access to Rift Stones, which serve as a sort of portal to parallel games universes where we get to recruit the pawns of the Arisen from that universe. Even though pawns belonging to other Arisen were summoned to serve that very same Arisen, that's not a problem as you're still an Arisen, and that's enough to command their loyalty. For story purposes, there are some pawns that you cannot hire in the game, but any pawn that you manage to hire will prove as loyal as your own.

Final Fantasy. Probably the most well-known RPG franchise in the world (besides Pokémon), Square Enix (formerly Square) has been churning out Final Fantasy titles for over 35 years. Beloved by millions, the franchise is still proving popular today on multiple different consoles.
With its humble beginnings on the NES, to us, it's always felt like a Nintendo series. Even if the late '90s would say otherwise. We've had a Best Final Fantasy Games list for some time here, but we've only ever included the mainline entries in the series. Now, we want to shake things up a bit — and it's up to you to influence the order.

Developed by FromSoftware for Japan Studio, a former subsidiary of Sony Interactive Entertainment, Bloodborne made its debut exclusively on the PlayStation 4.

What will Todd Howard and the rest of the team be doing to celebrate this milestone? It's hard to say at this stage.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been nearly eight years since the launch of Civilization VI, which is the longest gap between mainline Civ entries the series has seen since the first game appeared way back in 1991. It's the perfect time for a new contender to rise and claim the historical 4X throne, and indeed, many have tried, and some have even come close. Soren Johnson and the gang at Mohawk Games struck gold in Old World by zeroing in on the ancient era and opening up the personal lives of rulers and generals as fields of play. Humankind let you fuse and blend cultures over the arc of time like a world-historic Doctor Moreau.
Millennia is perhaps the Civ-like that's clung most tightly to the genre's apron strings. It has a few new ideas that sound interesting on paper, but even as back-of-the-box features, they're clearly not meant to significantly disrupt the established order. This is a strategy game that very much wants to be like Civilization, and has a lot of enthusiasm for the subject matter. Unfortunately, it isn't a particularly good student.

What are Pawn quests in Dragon's Dogma 2?


In Dragon's Dogma 2, Pawn quests allow you to reward other players for strengthening your Pawns or collecting items. This request and its reward are visible to other players when they encounter your Pawn in the wild or the Rift. By doing this, you can obtain rare or valuable resources from others, providing them with items of equal value as rewards or gain badges from other people who use your Pawn.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here’s one for all you connoisseurs of the horrific consequences of your own actions. Regicide-em-up visual novel Slay the Princess’ new update brings with it new dialogue and music, fleshing out the game with additional choices, expanded scenes, and orchestral renditions of some choice tracks. The new content takes the form of new animations and “more than 3,000 words of additional and restructured dialogue choices and conversations.” That is easily enough words to tell the Stanley Parable-esque narrator that you’re on to him and whatever mind games he’s playing, with enough left over for the other voices in your head to make you doubt your own morality with alarming frequency.

Joel's been known to leave surprises, namely mechs before they officially launched a while back. And now he's seemingly granted a group of lucky players the chance to ride about in an armoured truck outfitted with guns. Maybe, just maybe this signals their imminent release?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Grab a shovel.
South Park’s history with video games has been a mixed bag for the most part and the latest instalment, South Park: Snow Day!, had a lot to live up to following the critical success of Ubisoft’s The Stick of Truth and its sequel, The Fractured But Whole. A shift in genre and developer — Question LLC is at the helm here — has resulted in a co-op multiplayer action game that has some promising ideas but is ultimately let down by some significant performance issues (at least on Nintendo Switch) and an unsatisfying gameplay loop.
South Park: Snow Day takes place shortly after the events of The Fractured But Whole, focusing on the customisable New Kid protagonist as they interact with the source material’s eccentric cast of characters. The premise is a lot simpler this time around, however, with the plot focusing on the titular snow day that has made its way to South Park. Eric Cartman is obviously ecstatic about this – he doesn’t have to go to school and enlists the New Kid to participate in a series of Snow-based battles and other shenanigans.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At first glance, this shadow-hopping top-downer looks like a nostalgic stealth game designed to evoke the boxy subterranean environments of the first Metal Gear Solid. But really it is a tough single-player fighting game with stealth bits attached. It is closer in design to kung-fu brawler Sifu than it is to any of Solid Snake's various mischiefs. And while this mash-up of influences intrigues me, it can also feel like a layer cake of awkwardly clashing flavours. Like that very pretty but questionable cake, Raw Metal feels a little underbaked.

Throughout its lifecycle, players have enjoyed certain eras of the battle royale much more than others. While everyone has their own opinion, most agree that one specific Resurgence mode map, and one particular sniper rifle meta, were the best time to play the game. Now, an emoji-eye tweet from the official Call of Duty account might be hinting at a return in Modern Warfare 3's Warzone Season 3.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Like Vermund, many adventures await you in Battahl, from side quests to crucial parts in the main story. This also includes the Dragon's Dogma 2 Shadowed Prayers quest, an objective that involves protecting Empress Nadinia. 


Dragon's Dogma 2 Shadowed Prayers guide


After pledging your aid to Menella in Nation of the Lambert Flame, you'll get one step closer to the Shadowed Prayers quest. It should either unlock after a guard approaches the player or when encountering Menella at the Flamebearer Palace. Meet her there again in the morning, and she will ask you to look for a mysterious assassin. The description mentions a man "with his hair tied back" and a "wounded right arm." 


Go up the stairs to look for this specific character. Use the lantern to get a better look if it's too difficult to see. The man in question should be on the right side of the stairs with brown hair and an X-shaped scar on his right arm. Talking to him won't really do anything, so instead, grab him to satisfy the task in the Dragon's Dogma 2 Shadowed Prayers quest. However, it would be best to be quick about it due to the mission's time limit. It takes roughly two minutes to end, so keep that in mind when looking.

The man, now known as Herman, will immediately confess to the crime, taking you over to Irmhild for the quest completion. She'll provide a considerable amount of rewards in gold and other gems. Irmhild also mentions the location of the Hot Springs at the Volcanic Islands. If you're looking for a place with healing properties, this area proves helpful and rewards a trophy/achievement for those who enter.

Poisonous Proposition can be found after you arrive in Bhattal. Near the Rockmouse’s Burrow tavern where you first meet Menella, there’s a weird little man who will examine you, Jarle. Sad that you aren’t currently infected with poison, he asks for your help in studying various toxins.

It has much higher stakes than Stacklands, but most importantly, you summon cat familiars in it, and they go 'meow!'

Then, Remedy sneak a second teaser image alongside some tantalising lore snippets into their latest investor report (Thanks, resetera!) Also there’s an air fryer that turns nuggets into miniature black holes, or something. I’m not sure because, honestly, I never learned to appreciate Control’s wonderful architecture and lore because the combat made me want to gnaw my fingers off. Good news, then, for everyone except me specifically. We’ve got a few more scraps of info about its (presumably) almost entirely combat focused spin-off title, currently known as ‘Condor’. 


“After the Hiss invasion, the Oldest House is under lockdown: a boiling pot of volatile and dangerous supernatural forces,” forewarns the infographic. “Trapped within is the last vestige of the Federal Bureau of Control who will need to take a stand and push back to regain control.” You can take shifts watching the full image in case it does anything untoward below.

While the game itself is enjoyable to most, it launched with microtransactions that provide in-game currency, as well as a litany of technical issues for some players. Today, Capcom outlined some of its plans to update the game in the "near future," but specifically notes that improvements to frame rate will come in later patches. That said, these quick fixes are still useful.
In addition to general text and bug fixes, there are a few significant quality-of-life improvements. For starters, the Pawn Guild now sells a lot more "Art of Metamorphosis" items, which is how you can change the appearance of a character or pawn after they've already been created.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dawntrail, the fifth expansion for Final Fantasy XIV, is coming on July 2. The game is also getting a collector’s edition.  
The $39.99 expansion takes players to the tropical island of Yok Tural and introduces a new storyline, two new playable classes (Pictomancer and Viper), and the level cap raised to 100, among other additions. Dawntrail will be available in all versions of the game, including the newly launched Xbox editions. 
During PAX East this past weekend, FFXIV director/producer Naoki Yoshida unveiled the Dawntrail Digital Collector’s Edition and the goodies-filled physical Collector’s Box. Here’s what comes in each package: 
Collector’s Box ($155.00)

Dawntrail Special Art Box 
Expertly Crafted Viper Figure (H 9.65" x W 4.52" x D 5.90"/H 24.5cm x W 11.5cm x D 15cm)
Adventurer’s Cloth Map (16.53" x 29.52"/42cm x 75cm)
The Unending Journey Notebook (5.90" x 4.33"/15cm x 11cm)
Adventurer’s Pen Case (8.26" x 9.44"/21cm x 24cm)
Dawntrail Digital Collector’s Edition ($59.99)

In-game Item: Ark Mount 
In-game Item: Garnet Minion 
In-game Item: Chocobo Brush: Pictomancer Weapon 
While the Digital Collector's Edition and Collector's Box must be purchased separately, a bundle containing both is called the Dawntrail Collector's Edition and runs for $214.99. However, it only contains a game code for the Windows/Mac version of Dawntrail. 
Pre-orders for the standard and collector's edition items begin Tuesday, March 26, at 9 a.m. PT. Doing so at certain retailers grants the bonus in-game items: Wind-up Zidane Minion and Azeyma's Earrings.]]></summary>

It isn't happy was simply a garden-variety ARPG, and while this works in its favour most times, sometimes it does not. Take the Dragonsplague, for example, which may or may not brick your playthrough.


The Dragonsplague is an all-new mechanic not present in the original. It's a disease of sorts that pops up after fighting dragons and drakes, which turns the afflicted Pawn into a veritable nuke. Notably, if you don't notice that your Pawn has red pulsating eyes, refuses your commands, and generally behaves strangely, and then go to a city inn to rest up, the Pawn in question will turn into a shadowy dragon-creature and kill every NPC in the city. No, this is not a joke, and the community's been up in arms about Dragonsplague s…]]></summary>

Capcom isn't twiddling its thumbs, though, as the studio's just announced the first major suite of planned updates.


It should come as no surprise that some of the upcoming changes appear to have sprung up directly from player feedback. Notably, the game currently lacks a 'New Game' option, which effectively results in a situation where players cannot begin an entirely new playthrough without scouring through their game files and duking it out with the default cloud save solution. This, combined with no ability to have multiple save games in tow, means that this cutting-edge ARPG has a strange absence of industry-standard features, w…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stellar Blade, the flashy action game from ShiftUp, isn't officially out until late April, but eager players can get their hands on the game as soon as this week. A free demo hits the PlayStation Store this Friday, March 29, and will throw players headfirst into the game's opening moments. To get an idea of what that gameplay looks like, check out the demo trailer below.


Game director Hyung Tae Kim gave a deeper explanation on the PlayStation Blog. He writes, "This first stage will include the tutorial phase to help you familiarize yourself with basic combat features as you explore post-war Eidos 7, a human city now infested by the Naytiba, giving you an early grasp of gameplay mechanics that will serve you throughout the game’s story."
Stellar Blade was quietly in development over the past few years (originally known as Project EVE) before its in-depth feature during January's State of Play event. The game follows Eve, the wielder of the titular Stellar Blade, as she journeys back down to Earth to save the people there from alien and robot attacks. For more on the game, you can take a look at our four-page feature in issue 364 of Game Informer magazine.
Stellar Blade is a PS5 exclusive that launches on April 26. Its demo launches on March 29 at 7 AM PDT / 2 PM GMT.

Many of the pre-order and special edition bonus items players can get with the upcoming Dawntrail expansion are suspiciously FF9-themed, you see, but when pointing this out to PAX-goers, Yoshi-P said "the reason is a secret" for now, sparking fresh rumours about Square Enix's supposed Final Fantasy IX remake/remaster.

Right before the game's release, people learned that Dragon's Dogma 2 would feature the option for players to pay for an easier experience. Many didn't take it kindly, which you can attest to by looking at the game's Steam reviews.


Even though the microtransactions present in the game are far from the worst we've seen in Capcom's history, they still hit like an unnecessary betrayal — even worse, they're predictable and boring. Here's a list of truly groundbreaking microtransactions they should come up with next if they have the guts:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A big part of RPGs these days that you might not expect is fashion. You get to create your own character, so they should be able to wear clothes of your choosing. Dragon’s Dogma 2 is no different, but if you’re frustrated by your armor colors and want to dye them, I’ve got bad news for you.


You can’t dye armor in Dragon’s Dogma 2.


Some may call me a liar. That’s because when you get to Battahl, at a tavern in Bakbahtal, you can find dyes. These come in a variety of colors. But here’s the thing: those aren’t for your armor.

How to use dyes in Dragon’s Dogma 2


Dyes in Dragon’s Dogma 2 can be bought from a vendor found behind the Rockmouse’s Burrow tavern in Bakbattahl. This is the tavern where you meet Menella for the first time. Each one can be bought for 500 RC. Once they’re in your inventory, you may quickly find that they can’t be used. There are few clues to their immediate purpose.


You need to take all your dye to an appearance vendor or Barbarie. They appear as a pair of sheers on your map, and the nearest one is Mettefere’s Cosmetics further into town.


Screenshot by Destructoid


When you talk to the vendor, you’ll get a message that all your dyes have been handed over. Once again, this can be very confusing, because that’s all the information you are given. However, if you pay for a new hairstyle or body markings, you will find that you can change these to new, brighter, more vibrant colors. These can be found under a new heading when you’re picking a color.


That’s it. That’s what the dyes are for. They cannot be applied to armor. Armor cannot be dyed. But your hair can.

We all know how easy it can be to lose ourselves in our Nintendo Switch from time to time. You might find yourself picking up something like Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom or the recently launched Balatro and have the genuine intention to only play for around 10 or 15 minutes. Suddenly, it's 2am and your bladder is in dire need of some drainage. We've all been there.
For one Japanese police officer at the Tenri Police Station, however, time on the Switch has unfortunately meant that his attention to his role has suffered, leading to a bit of a slapped wrist and docked pay (via Japan News).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The horror visual novel Slay the Princess was met with plenty of accolades when it launched in October 2023, and now there's even more to love about its dark and twisting narrative. Developer Black Tabby Games released a free update today, introducing all-new dialogue and music while fleshing out endgame content. 


It's a pretty substantial update, too. According to the devs, there are over 3,000 words of additional dialogue, including structure changes to conversations and dialogue choices. There are also new animations to inject even more life into to the looping, death-defying adventure. They didn't forget about the soundtrack, either. Some of the climactic tracks now have orchestral versions that the Czech National Symphony Orchestra recorded for the game.

Just an ordinary cabin in the woods


Black Tabby Games' lead writer Tony Howard-Arias thanked players for the life-changing support the game has received since its launch. While giving a shoutout to fans who made art, streamed Slay the Princess, told friends, or even just tried it out, he added that all the support means "we can keep working on it to try and fulfill our vision for the game." 


To mark the occasion of 200,000 copies sold, Slay the Princess will be available at a 20 percent discount on Steam as part of the Midweek Madness sale. That sale will last through Monday, April 8. There's also a new, very appropriately curated "Cabins in the Woods" bundle, which includes Slay the Princess, Inscryption, and What Remains of Edith Finch at 10 percent off. If you haven't had a chance to check out this gem yet, it sounds like now is the best time to do so.

Last year we got our first DLC expansion to 2022's brilliant beat-em-up Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge. The Dimension Shellshock DLC was awesome, adding in a new roguelike Survival Mode, two new fighters and a host of fresh features besides.
We don't want to mimic that one Kylo Ren meme too much, but this is a game that is always going to leave us wanting more. Fortunately, it sounds like the game's development studio, Tribute Games, is up for it too (thanks, GoNintendo).

Their plans for the PC version include letting players acquire dwellings earlier on in the story, improving quality when DLSS super resolution is enabled, and adding the option to start a new game when save data already exists.

As they often do for tentpole characters, Nintendo —at their flagship store at Rockefeller Center in New York City— held a special launch event for their leading lady, Princess Peach. Having recently (as of The Super Mario Bros. Movie) stepped out of Mario’s portly shadow and into the limelight—thanks partially to Jack Black’s hit song ‘Peaches’— Peach now stars in a game of her own, Princess Peach: Showtime!, which released on March 22, 2024.
Unlike many launch events held at Nintendo NY over the past few years for The Legend of Zelda and Kirby, the festivities for Princess Peach began on Friday, and ran all through the weekend, on Saturday and Sunday, where attendees could play the game on the store’s giant widescreen, sample Kung-Fu Tea’s new Princess Peach variant, purchase any of the considerable amount of Peach-themed merch, get your photo taken with Peach herself (she deigned to appear in person and take photos with the common folk), and of course pick up a copy of the game and/or a pair of matching pink Joy-Cons.

        <updated>2024-03-25T11:33:54.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last week, Capcom released the long-awaited Dragon's Dogma 2. Now, there was a bit of controversy surrounding its launch, such as the sheer number of DLC, but this post is not going to be about that (I'm sure you all have your own thoughts on the story). What I am going to say is that a rumor is circulating which states the game could potentially lead to an open-world Resident Evil installment.


That's according to known leaker AestheticGamer (thanks Eurogamer). In a post on Twitter/X a few days ago, it's been alluded to that the engine that powers Dragon's Dogma 2 could result in open-world functionality for RE9, a game which has not yet been officially announced. The tech might also be used for the next Monster Hunter.




AestheticGamer explains that DD2 uses an expanded version of Capcom's RE Engine, which has been used in the development of the new Resident Evil games (and the remakes), as well as Monster Hinter Rise and Devil May Cry 5.


It will still retain its RE DNA, though


Now, it should be said that this has not been officially confirmed, so we can only assume these are speculations at this stage. However, the leaker does go on to say that RE9 – and other upcoming projects spoken about – will still retain their respective DNAs. This means a Resident Evil game that's open-world will still feel like Resident Evil.


But we don't know what's happening with the ninth entry yet. Some may have concerns about the long-running survival horror series becoming open-world. The franchise has typically opted for more linear structures with a tightly packed story.


Whatever the case may be, Capcom will surely set the record straight in due time. Since the reboot in 2017, as well as the remakes, Resident Evil has been on top form. A new game is something a lot of fans will be looking forward to, so hopefully some sort of official announcement will be made soon.

I love anime-inspired games, and Reaper 2 is the perfect example, as it lets you play as a character in the world of the much-loved series Bleach. It comes with some of my favorite RPG elements—grinding quests and bosses to level up and investing in abilities and skill trees.


If you’re having trouble beating enemies and the grind is giving you a headache, using Reaper 2 codes can give you the boost you need—be it via more cash, rerolling your race, or resetting all your stats.

It's a fairly busy week for the UK boxed charts, with several new entries making it into the top ten. First up, of course, is Princess Peach: Showtime! coming in at number three. A respectable debut, to be sure, though it wasn't enough to beat EA Sports FC 24 at number one and Capcom's new action RPG Dragon's Dogma II at number two.
The other newcomers are Rise of the Ronin at number five and Alone in the Dark at number six. Overall, considering how long FC 24 has been available at this point, it seems a shame that none of the newcomers could knock it off its perch. Maybe next time, eh?

Capcom launched Dragon's Dogma 2 this week, and if you're craving a similar fix on the Nintendo Switch we thought now was a great time to let you know that Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen is actually on sale via the eShop across multiple regions.
It reduces the title from $29.99 / £24.99 to just $4.99 / £4.24, which is more than 80% off its standard price. There's just a day remaining on this sale in the UK, with the sale ending in the US on March 26th. So, if you haven't already played this title, or would like to revisit it on Nintendo's hybrid system, now is the "perfect time".

Hollywood is adapting Nintendo's Legend of Zelda series into a live-action movie and while there's plenty of excitement about the upcoming film there's also some concern.
With this in mind, the film's director Wes Ball (known for the Maze Runner trilogy) has told Total Film how he understands just how "important" the Zelda franchise is to fans and aims to "fulfil people's greatest desires".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Acolyte of the Altar, the roguelike deckbuilder with a wasteland twist from developer Black Kite Games, hits PC via Steam on March 25. Ahead of the game's launch next week, Game Informer can exclusively reveal the Acolyte of the Altar launch trailer, which features plenty of deckbuilder action and another taste of this Magic: The Gathering and Shadow of the Colossus-inspired game. 
"Journey through desolate wastelands and hunt down colossal Beasts to grow stronger and serve your chosen Patron deity," the game's description reads. 
Check out the Acolyte of the Altar launch trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, Acolyte of the Altar continues to look great (and spooky), and we're excited to try our hands at its unique style of deckbuilder. 
"Beware," the game's Steam page reads. "Beasts grow stronger during battle, allowing them to consume your creatures or counter your spells. Carve profane Gifts from these behemoths and grow stronger to serve your Patron. But serve them to what end?"
That is the question players will answer when Acolyte of the Altar hits PC via Steam on March 25, 2024. If you're interested, you can play a demo of the game on Steam right now. 
Here are some Acolyte of the Altar screenshots to enjoy in the meantime:

Earlier this week, we revealed how a trained task force dubbed 'Team 0%' was attempting to complete every community level in the original Super Mario Maker game before Nintendo shut down online functionality for the Wii U and 3DS on 8th April 2024.
While it was struggling to knock over one final level called 'Trimming the Herbs', since then the story has taken a bit of a turn - with the creator of this level confirming it was an "illegitimate upload" (thanks, OatmealDome). Therefore, the final community level was in fact "The Last Dance", which was cleared by 'Yamada_SMM2' on 15th March 2024.

The titans of industry were inspired to produce more goods when I visited their factories. But as the years have passed, so do their eyes pass over me, to eye curiously my replacements. Will you try the new style, ma’am? It’s so much better than that old thing. I’ve watched my friends grow old and die. My brother got caught in traffic and caused a horrific level crossing collision. I get sick more often, wheezing to a halt wherever I am. When I visit the doctor for a spot of renewal, they tell me, “Sorry, I can’t help. You’re too old.” When will I be autoreplaced? Woe is the tale of the Balogh Goods Truck. But what if we could slow or pause the steady march of time? In OpenTTD 14, you can.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time reinvented the series in 3D and became its new gold standard, Nintendo followed up with a surreal sequel in Majora's Mask. Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days. Majora's Mask's unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.
Join Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard today and each Friday on Twitch at 2 p.m. CT as they gradually work their way through the entire game until Termina is saved.

In a post to X (formerly known as Twitter), the studio's co-founders Guha and Karthik Bala revealed the team was working on a big project that an outside partner suddenly canceled. As a result, it might not be able to maintain its current team size; 46 out of 121 employees were given notice they may be laid off in the next 60 days. 
“This is a rough environment for a lot of indie studios, and like them, we are faced with some very hard choices,” Velan writes in the post. Should the worst come, Velan states it will do its best to support affected staff members. You can read the full post below.

I've been having a swell time with this over the last few days, particularly as I noodle about in the other big backdrops that weren't available in its earlier demo.  
But there's been another Summerhouse development this week that has arguably delighted me even more. Solo developer Friedemann took to Xwitter on Monday to detail all the games that inspired him to make Summerhouse in the first place, and there are some really surprising, but fascinating call outs in there, including Stronghold Crusader and Sword & Sworcery. I love it when developers go in-depth about things they've seen in other games and tried to riff on in their own creations, so please, let's make this a tradition for all new game releases, yeah?

In terms of performance problems, Steam players have reported issues such as framerate drops, freezes, and crashes. Capcom has acknowledged these issues in a Steam blog post where it says, “To all those looking forward to this game, we sincerely apologize for any inconvenience,” and adds, “We are investigating/fixing critical problems such as crashes and freezing.

        <updated>2024-03-22T17:04:16.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Square Enix today revealed a new look at Final XVI: The Rising Tide, the upcoming piece of DLC scheduled to launch as part of the game's expansion pass. The new story content opens the door to an entirely new area to explore in Valisthea, but the big draw is the appearance of the Eikon Leviathan. 
Back in December, Final Fantasy XVI players were treated to the Echoes of the Fallen expansion, which took Clive and his companions to a long-abandoned tower created by the Fallen precursor civilization. The Rising Tide will further expand on the game's story, but in a new direction, focusing on Leviathan. In the new story sequence, a letter arrives to the hideaway with a request for help from the Dominant of that long-lost Eikon of Water, and the party must set out to face a new threat. We detailed some of what we learned in a preview earlier this month. 
The new trailer puts a big focus on combat sequences, giving us a good look at several fights, including Clive acting as Ifrit to battle against Leviathan as they each coast over a massive body of water. The new sights and characters offer a convincing reason to redownload that massive RPG and take Clive for one more big adventure.

Recent events have conspired so that I have experienced a bunch of Warhammer 40K in a way that exposes me to the world passively, without lore dumping. I played the PowerWash Sim x 40K crossover DLC and loved it for just putting cool big machines in front of me and refusing to explain further, so when James picked Darktide as this month's RPS Game Club Game, like someone incautiously opening the door to Mormons, I was ready to let more of the God Emperor into my life. Except, having played some Darktide, I do not want to play Darktide. For me, playing Darktide does, in some measure, get in the way of enjoying Darktide.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Being at once repellent and compelling is some kind of criterion for Real Art Status, and Horses - developed by Saturnalia developers Santa Ragione and directed by Andrea Lucco Borlera - certainly earns that accolade. Out later in 2024, this first-person horror game takes inspiration from the Surrealism art movement and from silent cinema, with monochrome visuals, speech cards in place of spoken dialogue, and rickety live-action footage for certain animations and transitions. But it's also, I think, a meditation on the unique kinds of grotesque only videogames can produce, one that goes beyond the mere portrayal of squalor and bloodshed to explore particular generations and traditions of videogame graphics that are intrinsically cursed. It stood out amid the breezy action games and cosy life sims of this year's Day Of The Devs expo in San Francisco like a bell-tolling plaguebearer in a crowd of Tellytubbies.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Airships have an odd place in games. They pop up as a central idea in a fair few games, but there hasn't really been a definitive one about actually piloting your own.
Passing By - A Tailwind Journey isn't aiming for that, I think, but it nonetheless captures a key part of the appeal such a game should have. It's the sense of drifting, both with the wind and with life more generally, and the stretches of not particularly much happening. But in a good way. This is a game about taking it easy, choosing to sail by the less remarkable things unless you happen to fancy stretching your legs, and having only the trust that the currents will take you where you're meant to go when they get around to it. It's not a purely vibe-based game, but you'll definitely enjoy it a lot more if you can appreciate the mood.

Not forgetting that this is pre-release, so his place within the top 100 isn't quite as good as it seems. This pains me. I am saddened that my sweet, sweet boy Bronco isn't being picked up by adventurers as much as I'd like. He may not be a 1:1 recreation of a popular anime character or like, Tony Blair, but he is fantastic at shredding monsters.
Thing is, his ranking means that I'm not doing enough. Right now, I need to make his CV more appealing to prospective clientele and I need to become the agent he deserves. Dragon's Dogma 2 may be an action RPG, but it is also about being the best agent you can possibly be.

        <updated>2024-03-22T15:15:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Grasshopper Manufacture announced during its summer showcase last year that its 2011 supernatural action game Shadows of the Damned is getting an encore in the form of a remaster. We now know the title of that update, along with a release window.
The newly christened Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered is coming later this year. Unfortunately, the game’s website and Steam page don’t detail exactly how the game has been enhanced from a performance standpoint. Grasshopper did release screenshots, so you’ll have to use those to discern the difference between this re-release and the original. A demo of the game is currently playable at Grasshopper’s booth at PAX East. 

Shadows of the Damned was first released for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 on June 21, 2011, and served as a collaboration between Resident Evil mastermind Shinji Mikami (who served as producer) and Grasshopper founder Goichi “Suda51” Suda (the game's writer). It stars Garcia Hotspur, a demon hunter who battles his way through the depths of the underworld to rescue his captive girlfriend, Paula. The game’s fun, over-the-shoulder shooter action combined with its irreverent, absurd humor earned it a 9.25 out of 10 in our original review and a cult following over the last 13 years. EA originally published Shadows of the Damned, and it was never ported to other platforms. Grasshopper is self-publishing the remaster. 
Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.]]></summary>

It was originally due out on June 21st, but then FromSoftware announced that Elden Ring: Shadow Of The Erdtree would also launch on the same day. Not ideal. So, Jyamma delayed Enotria's release, and in an announcement at last night's Future Games Show, we now know it's launching in August. It has, however, dropped itself into another conundrum: Black Myth: Wukong, another hotly anticipated Soulslike, arrives a day earlier.

It’s creative and intelligent and lets you fill other players’ worlds with recruitable humanoid versions of your pet cats. Still, a technical masterclass it is not. In my performance analysis, I touched on DD2 being particularly unplayable on the Steam Deck, suffering from sub-10fps framerates and a bunch of broken settings. Since that was based on pre-release code, I had quietly hoped that Capcom could pull something – anything – out of the bag to salvage handheld PC play in time for launch day, but now the time has come, I’ve checked again, and nope. This RPG adventure simply doesn’t work on the Steam Deck, and probably never will.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Still Wakes the Deep, the atmospheric horror game from the makers of Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs and Everybody’s Gone to the Rapture, has a new trailer and a June release date. First revealed last June at the Xbox Games Showcase, it centers on an oil rig worker fighting to survive a supernatural threat. 
Developed by The Chinese Room, today’s Future Game Show provided a platform for a new trailer that serves as an effective tone-setter. Set in 1975, you play as an oil rig worker trapped on a deep sea rig off the coast of Scotland. Communications have been lost, and an unknown horror has overtaken the rig. The first-person adventure tasks you with locating your crew as a mysterious threat pursues you, and the raging ocean gradually tears the rig apart. With no weapons or special abilities, exploration is the name of the game.


Still Wakes the Deep is launching on June 18 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. It will also launch on Game Pass for console and PC. 
For more on The Chinese Room, the studio has also taken the reins of Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2, also slated to release this year. You can read more about what the studio has in store for that game here.]]></summary>

And I do mean done, as studio founder Swen Vincke said during a talk at the Game Developers Conference (GDC) that the team is moving on from the series.

        <id>122314</id>
        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/03/21/larian-ceo-says-the-studio-is-done-with-baldurs-gate-3-to-focus-on-something-new"/>
        <updated>2024-03-21T20:25:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Baldur’s Gate 3 was one of 2023’s most successful and critically acclaimed games, with many hailing it as one of the best role-playing games ever made. However, if you were hoping for the game to get an expansion or a sequel, that won’t be the case - at least not from its developer, Larian Studios. 
As reported by PC Gamer, Larian CEO Swen Vincke stated during an address at GDC today that the studio is finished with Baldur’s Gate 3. That means it won’t be getting any expansions nor will it be making a Baldur’s Gate 4. "We are a company of big ideas. We are not a company that's made to create DLCs or expansions," Vincke said. "We tried that actually, a few times. It failed every single time. It's not our thing. Life is too short. Our ambitions are very large.”
Not only that, but the studio is moving on from Dungeons & Dragons in general, with Vincke saying that "it's going to be up to Wizards of the Coast because it's their IP, to find somebody to take over the torch."


While Vincke says Larian is proud of what it accomplished, the studio wants to focus on a brand-new project. There's no telling what Larian may tackle next; given that it made Baldur's Gate 3 and the Divinity series, it's hard to imagine the studio not making another RPG of some sort. We'll have to wait and see. 
Baldur’s Gate 3 was released last August following a lengthy early access period to rave reviews, including several Game of the Year wins. While it’s disappointing that we won’t see any meaningful story updates for the title, we’re excited to see what Larian has in store next. 
As for other Dungeons & Dragons games that will pick up the torch, there's a few big titles on the horizon. Chief among them is Starbreeze's in-development D&D cooperative multiplayer game and Gameloft's D&D survival sim. 
You can read our review of Baldur's Gate 3 here. The game is also nominated for 10 BAFTA Awards next month, and you can read the full list of nominees here.

In recent years there have been a few attempts to make a game like The Movies, with games like Moviehouse and Filmmaker Tycoon sitting pretty at 'mostly negative' status on Steam because they are not, in fact, like The Movies beyond the basic premise. But Blockbuster Inc. has shouldered its way into the conversation, wearing big puffy trousers, shouting through an old-timey megaphone, and openly billing itself as a "spiritual successor" to The Movies. It's launching on June 6th this year, but you can play the prologue on Steam for free right now.

In that short timeframe it has earned rave reviews (including a 9.5 out of 10 from us), positioned itself as a Game of the Year contender, and sold 1 million copies. To the delight of many, a mobile version was recently announced to be in the works. 
For some players, Balatro seemingly came out of nowhere and its sole developer, LocalThunk, is just as mysterious. The highly private creator doesn't share his real name, but I was able to speak with him about his game development history, his philosophy for making games, how he came up with the idea for Balatro, and his reaction to its positive reception. Perhaps most importantly, LocalThunk also tells me the…]]></summary>

Review code had even been sent out to press. But it was clear that the game needed more time in the oven, as developers Drop Bear Bytes acknowledged they needed "additional polish time and QA manpower" to test the "thousands of permutations" available in its deeply decision-driven storyline. Happily, that polish time has now come to an end, as the devs have today announced a fresh release date of April 10th.

        <updated>2024-03-21T17:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ark: The Animated Series has surprised launched today on Paramount +. Based on the hit Ark: Survival Evolved, the series was first announced at The Game Awards in 2020 and went from not having a release date or platform to suddenly having its first six episodes available now in the U.S. and Canada.
The series follows Helena Walker, a paleontologist who washes ashore a mysterious island brimming with dinosaurs and other extinct wildlife. After meeting another survivor and hunter named Bob, Helena learns how to fend for herself in this strange land while encountering myriad threats and survivors from throughout history. While the first six episodes of Season 1 are out now, the remaining seven episodes will arrive at a later date. 
The show’s star-studded cast includes Madeleine Madden, Michelle Yeoh, Vin Diesel, Gerard Butler, David Tennant, Russell Crowe, Jeffrey Wright, Karl Urban, Zahn McClarnon, Devery Jacobs, Elliot Page, Malcolm McDowell, Deborah Mailman, and Alan Tudyk. Check out the premiere trailer below. 


To mark the occasion, Ark: Survival Ascended is holding a special tie-in event in which players can unlock skins based on characters from the animated series, which replicate the show’s art style. Obtaining these involves collecting a series of notes titled “Dear Jane” written by Karl Urban’s character in the show, Bob. The first drop of skins will be for Helena, Bob, Dodo, and Scary the Parasaur. New notes will appear in the game each Tuesday and Thursday until April 11. Check out the trailer below.


Meanwhile, we're still awaiting an update on the long-quiet Ark 2 (also featuring Vin Diesel) which was announced in 2020 at The Game Awards. That game is currently scheduled to launch towards the end of the year. Hopefully this animated show is a decent holdover until the next big game arrives.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Claymation-me-do Harold Halibut is one of those puzzle-y adventure games that instantly catches your eye when you see it in screenshots and trailers. I mean, who wouldn't be intrigued by its beautiful handmade models and sets? They all have such a lovely texture to them, and the slightly ramshackle way they fit together gives the game a firm sense of place. But after playing an early preview build of Harold Halibut this week, I've been disappointed by just how frustrating it is to actually play. It's not that it's difficult. In fact, the tasks Harold's assigned in the opening few hours of the game are almost insultingly easy, extending to little more than 'feed the fish' and 'talk to so and so', all of which can usually be accomplished by interacting with a single button prompt to move the story along.
Rather, it's Harold himself that makes everything feel like such a chore. He's a bit of a dolt, you see, and everyone around him knows it, treating him with such weary and open disdain like he's some kind of village idiot that I, too, quickly came to dislike him. Harold doesn't help himself much either on this front, weathering everyone's underlying frustration with him like it's all water off a duck's back. It doesn't seem to faze him in the slightest, perhaps because he's too oblivious to even notice. But while this doziness might wash in a book or TV show, taking control of such a character in a game isn't nearly as pleasant. After all, it's not just Harold that's being treated like an ignoramus. By extension, you, the player, are as well, which isn't just immersion-breaking and frustrating, but it's also insulting to your own intelligence.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I usually know right away when I'm going to enjoy interactive fiction. But I don't always know why. Isle Of Maligree is a bit of an all-rounder, as pretty much every part of it is doing something right, but it's the sense that you're making your own version of its story that marks it out.
People are going missing on the island, and you've been sent to investigate. Only, it seems this isn't the first time, because some sinister magic is causing everyone to forget the whole thing ever happened. If you don't figure it out in time, you'll have to make a new character and try again. And if you're an amazing genius who figures it out on your first try... you'll want to try again anyway, to play it a different way and see what you missed. Maybe one day I'll even do it without getting stabbed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Before a month of my life vanished into customising cards and rigging decks in Balatro, my desire to conquer dungeons by fixing gambling tools came from playing Slice & Dice. First released in 2020, it's a gauntlet of fantasy turn-based battles where most attacks, abilities, buffs, debuffs, and items are very cleverly handled by mapping them onto the faces of dice. Oh, you're going to make your dice so much better! Now Slice & Dice has finally arrived on Steam in search of a wider audience, accompanied by an update adding oodles of new heroes, enemies, items, and more. For newcomers, hey, it has a demo.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been a while, but I'm finally back on the Nancy Drew mystery game train. Choo choo, next stop: San Francisco! This has pleasing synergy with my real life, because I'm currently watching through Monk, a popular detective show also set in San Francisco. Mr. Monk would be displeased by the house Nancy finds herself in this time, which is a mansion being converted into a B&B. The owner, Rose, is working on a shoestring budget and has decided that the best player to add to her renovation team is a young-adult woman who's a friend of a friend. It all makes sense! 
Nancy Drew: Message In A Haunted Mansion is the third game in the Nancy Drew mystery series of puzzle games, and boy does the weird first-person fixed camera work against you here. It's also a more disappointing plot than the previous games, but it adds in a new time system that, much like Stay Tuned For Danger, is an ambitious move - and in this case I think it sort of works. It's a mixed bag, is what I'm saying.

On the one hand, aww, because everyone likes a bargain 1440p-er. On the other, woo, because gaming-spec 4K monitors are usually some of the most financially devastating PC hardware pieces you can get. Anything that makes these super-sharp displays more affordable is, therefore, quite welcome. 160Hz, UHD visuals for £399? Sure, why not.

We’ve played as Peach in plenty of Mario-starring games through the years, but not since 2005’s Super Princess Peach has the artist formerly known as Princess Toadstool been the exclusive protagonist of her own journey. Princess Peach: Showtime is a wholly original adventure with an impressive amount of unique mechanics, but it fails to reach the platforming heights Nintendo has attained with its other characters in the past.


Showtime’s overall premise is one of the highlights as it creates an aesthetically interesting world that is able to look and play differently from level t…]]></summary>

In my review for 2016’s Hyper Light Drifter I wrote about how it was a game I created excuses for myself to keep playing after seeing credits writing, “I didn’t do it out of necessity; I did it because I wanted to stay in Hyper Light Drifter’s world for as long as possible.” I love the color, style, music, and overall vibe of that game, which is why I was so excited to finally go hands-on with its not-quite-a-sequel, Breaker, and finally have an excuse to exist in that world again.


“It’s not a sequel – it is just in the world of Hyper Light. It will have common threads, themes, and shared components,” director Alx Preston says. “If you played Drifter you will see reappearin…]]></summary>

While this isn't gameplay footage of me playing the game, I did get a chance to play the game recently, so Marcus Stewart and I decided to get together and chat about his time playing the game.
Hyper Light Breaker is entering early access on PC some time this year. For more on my time playing the game, you can read my full Hyper Light Breaker preview here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This article's headline is the characterisation of Everdeep Aurora given to me by publisher Ysbryd Games, but bizarrely enough, it reminded me initially of Bloodborne. A 2D platformer from Nautilus Games, Everdeep Aurora begins on the surface, where a ruptured crimson moon fills the sky with blazing meteors. That menacing moon is the first hint of Bloodborne, obviously. The second is the lamp-lit, locked-up house to one side, whose unseen occupant tells you to get lost, adding that they don’t believe all this crazy talk about the apocalypse. 


I thought at once of the wealthier residents of Yharnam, feasting and laughing hysterically behind the shutters of their fancy townhouses on the night of the Hunt. There are no pitchfork-wielding mobs or werewolves stalking the vicinity, however. But there is a frog by a campfire, who tells you that everybody else has sought shelter underground, and hands you a drill so you can follow them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Skydance New Media’s mysterious World War 2 Marvel game has a title: Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra. It also has its first trailer and a release window.
First announced in 2022, the game stars Captain America and Black Panther Azzuri, who is the grandfather of T’Challa. The trailer shows them pursuing the mutual goal of taking down the Nazis/Hydra, though for their own personal reasons. Hailing from different worlds, neither is particularly fond of the other's methods, which draws them into conflict. The game also stars Gabriel Jones of the Howling Commandos and Wakanda spy leader Nanali. First revealed at GDC, check out its first cinematic trailer below. 


Marvel 1943 is a linear single-player experience where you’ll occupy the roles of all four characters at various points, providing different perspectives on the narrative and the war. The project is led by Skydance president Amy Hennig, best known as the principle writer of the Uncharted franchise. 
Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra is coming in 2025, though platforms are currently unknown. You can learn more about how Skydance is approaching the game’s storytelling by reading our 2022 interview feature with Amy Hennig and Skydance's story consultant, Marc Bernardin.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[BPI, the UK's leading music industry group, views Voicify as one of the world’s largest and most egregious 'deepfake' AI music sites. The group is now threatening to sue the vocal cloning service if it continues to operate in its current form. While the site hasn't commented on the allegations directly, it recently rebranded to "Jammable" citing legal troubles.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dragon's Dogma 2 is an RPG of many admirable qualities. I’m especially attached to my Arisen’s current pair of Pawns, one of whom speaks with the wonderfully stretched intonations of a pitch-shifted Matt Berry. Sadly, none of its achievements pertain to technical fidelity. While decent-looking, Dragon’s Dogma 2 takes some serious hardware to maintain consistently smooth performance, with lowered quality settings lending only the most limp-wristed of helping hands.
DLSS and FSR 3 upscaling are more effective, but this is one game where powering through the worst of its stuttering and framerate drops will take more than a musclebound graphics card. Not for the first time with an RE Engine game, Dragon’s Dogma 2 appears severely CPU-limited, so it really does demand a fully-upgraded rig to ward off sluggishness – especially at higher resolutions.
Improving performance isn’t a completely hopeless endeavour, but besides the FPS wobbles, there are some settings oddities that need navigating as well. I’ll cover all that and more in this guide; even if we can’t fix Dragon’s Dogma 2 ourselves, at least we can better understand its strangeness.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You know when you remember a game really fondly and instead of ageing alongside you, it becomes more modern in memory? The Dragon's Dogma 2 experience is, essentially, how I remember its predecessor Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen. To me, DD2 feels like a remaster of the first, except it looks nicer, is more expansive, and features some rejigs to things like your AI pals.
Not that any of this is a bad thing! In fact, DD2's closeness to the original makes it just as much of a joy as the first, where your grand adventure isn't only grander, it's still at the whims of a world governed by chaotic physics and the passage of time. Quirks remain, for good and bad, but ultimately this is an RPG where you make travel plans and the game does it best to dash them. It never gets old.

Creating a sequel to a 12-year-old game is never an easy task. Recapturing the magic of the original while implementing modern technology and design strategies can mangle the core values that made the original special. Dragon’s Dogma 2 never loses sight of its roots, and constantly finds big and small ways to surprise me even 50 hours in. At its core, Dragon’s Dogma 2 captures a sense of adventure. While you’re the center point of the conflict and strife in the world, Dragon's Dogma 2 isn’t afraid to make you feel small. Around every bend, it…]]></summary>

        <updated>2024-03-20T14:44:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dragon Ball Sparking Zero had a big coming out party in the form of a 13-minute gameplay presentation that gave fans a nice look at its moment-to-moment combat. Bandai Namco showed off what's new, what's staying the same, and even revealed more characters joining the roster. 
Naturally, Goku and Vegeta square off to show off Sparking Zero’s combat. The 3D fighter retains the familiar behind-the-back style of its predecessors, but graphically speaking, the flashy ki blasts and transformations look better than ever. 


The presentation introduces four new mechanics. First up is Skill Count, a number that rises as you execute moves during the battle and is then spent to trigger special abilities. Revenge Counter lets players retaliate with a big attack in the midst of absorbing damage. Super Perception is a parry-type move that lets players deflect an attack at the last moment (such as Goku smacking away Vegeta’s Galick Gun), but doing this spends Skill Count points. Lastly, Vanishing Assaults are teleport-based attacks designed to close the gap at mid-range to keep the pressure on your opponent.
Dragon Ball Sparking Zero looks to have a massive roster of fighters (many of them variations of Goku and Vegeta), and the following characters are joining the line-up:
Broly (Super Saiyan Full Power)
Burter
Dyspo
Hit
Jeice
Kakunsa
Kale (Super Saiyan Berserk)
Master Roshi (Max Power)
Nappa
Super Trunks
Toppo

Dragon Ball Sparking Zero still doesn’t have a release window, but it’s coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's deeply frustrating and disappointing when games get pulled from store shelves due to licenses expiring, and too few ever return. So it's great news that almost four years after Sega stopped selling Obsidian's fascinating spy thriller RPG Alpha Protocol on Steam due to music rights expiring, it has returned to sale on GOG. I'm always surprised that Alpha Protocol hasn't reached serious cult classic status because, as much as parts are distinctly wonky, the globetrotting sneak-o-shooter fizzes with ideas for intense dialogue, branching plot, and reputation systems with consequences. You do feel like a spy going up against the world, backed up only by shifty allies and a ridiculous pair of giant sunglasses.

And what all people who make this fail to understand that the answer most normal people give if they think about it is "Erm, probably no, actually?"
Still, the internet made good hay from the prototype image Ubisoft shared on Xitter, as many people took the opportunity to make fun of the dialogue from Bloom, a prototype man in a prototype beanie who wants to be your friend.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Eight years after launching, Stardew Valley just keeps getting bigger and bigger. Update 1.6 arrived yesterday, with enough changes that the patch notes are 7308 words long. It bumps the farm-o-life sim's co-op player limit to eight, adds hundreds of new items, opens up a new progression system for "powerful perks and items", adds new events, lets you drink mayonnaise, and so much more that. Best of all, it lets you have more pets. New pets. Pets wearing hats.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft's highly publicized acquisition of Blizzard has had wide-reaching effects, and while some of them have been quite awful, this month showcases one of the upsides. Diablo IV, one of Blizzard's big 2023 releases, comes to Xbox Game Pass late next week, on March 28. We enjoyed the game quite a bit at launch, calling it a "massive and deeply engrossing action RPG," so if you've been waiting to check it out, now is a good time to do so.
This month also includes a trio of games built around cars, though the three are each very different. F1 23 simulates the realism and intensity of Formula 1 racing, Hot Wheels Unleashed 2 is an arcade racer full of child-like wonder, and Open Roads (which will launch on Game Pass) is a quieter, narrative-driven game about a mother and her daughter going on a road trip. Maybe they'll help me on my journey of learning how to drive.
Here's the rest of the line-up:
What's Coming To Game Pass This Month
Lightyear Frontier (Game Preview) (Cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X|S) – Today
MLB The Show 24 (Cloud and Console) – Today

It's initially due to run only for several weeks and will use wholly separate characters, though you can unlock cosmetics for your main wizards.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Later this week, Payload Studios' open world vehicular survival builder TerraTech Worlds launches into early access. As the name implies, it's a bigger, bolder and more ambitious take on their still very popular sandbox game TerraTech, but according to Payload's founder and CEO Russ Clarke, they're viewing this new version as more of a successor to TerraTech than a full-bodied sequel. "The overall quality of experience is really a huge leap forward," Clarke told me during a press presentation last week. "We're not calling it a sequel because we felt that making it a sequel would be a bit too constraining." Rather, it's "more of a reimagining" of the original game, says Clarke, with a change in engine and fresh investment from Tencent allowing them to reach the full potential of their original vision.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, after months of rumors and speculation, LEGO (in partnership with Wizards of the Coast) revealed the first full look at the new Dungeons & Dragons-themed building set entitled Red Dragon’s Tale. The large 3,745-piece set is set to release on April 1 in LEGO stores and to those in the LEGO Insiders program. Everyone else can roll for initiative on snagging a set on April 4, for the price of $359.99.
Produced through the popular LEGO Ideas platform, where fans are able to submit their own build concepts that are then refined and produced as official sets, the final set includes a full dungeon and tower, a tavern, and six minifigures (including an Orc Rogue, Gnome Fighter, Elf Wizard, and Dwarf Cleric). Builders also get several iconic D&D monsters, including an owlbear, beholder, displacer beast, and, of course, the red dragon Cinderhowl, who acts as the centerpiece of the set.

Interestingly, LEGO is offering an actual D&D adventure book to LEGO Insiders as a free digital download or as a paperback book that can be purchased with 2,7000 Insider points. That same book will show up on D&D Beyond (Wizards of the Coast’s digital hub for D&D) complete with characters sheets and digital dice. Presumably, the idea is that you could play out the adventure with the included LEGO minifigs and monsters as the miniatures used on the table, which is a pretty slick way for dedicated players to capitalize on the completed build.
In addition to the larger set, LEGO also revealed plans for a full line of D&D-themed minifigures, launching in September 2024.

In this sequel to 2016's alternately wistful and frenzied action-RPG, you are a debonair-looking sod with a hoverboard, paraglider, blades and guns, sent out into the procedurally generated realms of the Overgrowth to kill Abyss Kings, eat stat boosts and extract with loot.
The aforesaid hoverboard and glider, together with the streaking neon visual direction, suggest a game of fluid acrobatics, akin to the studio's last release Solar Ash, which, to quote Ed's review, "has you rollerblade around shattered worlds like a post apocalyptic gazelle on wheels". Perhaps that game exists deeper within Hyper Light Breaker, but during my 20 minutes with the game at GDC, I found myself stopping and starting and struggling to build momentum using a combat system that felt both deliberately challenging and stilted.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The remake of the 1997 classic Riven is officially launching later this year. This modern facelift of the acclaimed sequel to Myst is also coming to VR.
Developed by Cyan Worlds, a team led by the masterminds of the original game, Riven is being remade from the ground up in Unreal Engine 5. First announced in 2022, the game is promised to be a faithful homage that leverages modern tech to allow for immersive visuals, free movement, expanded storytelling, and new puzzles. Check out its latest teaser trailer below. 


Riven: The Sequel to Myst was first released in 1997 and has been hailed as a PC classic of the era. It's so beloved that an existing fan-driven remake, The Starry Expanse Project, was already in the works when Cyan Worlds announced this remake. Recognizing their efforts, Cyan Worlds worked with The Starry Expanse to incorporate their efforts into this official remake. 
Outside of PC, it's unclear which platforms, VR or otherwise, Riven will target. To keep up with similar projects, check out our Big List of Upcoming Video Game Remakes.]]></summary>

The 1.6 Patch is now live, and it's a doozy. If you want to read the patch notes in their entirety, which includes new content, balance updates, visual improvements, and more, you can do that right here.
The original story continues below...
Eight years after its official launch, Stardew Valley remains one of the most popular games on the market right now, which is no surprise; whether you're marrying a neighbor, farming crops, or toiling away in the mines, it's a game with something for everyone. Its creator, solo developer ConcernedApe, has updated it with plenty of free patches over the years, adding multiplayer, new farm types, and more, but when he moved on to work on his next game, Haunted Chocolatier, the Stardew updates came to an end. That is, until today.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Balatro, the hit poker-inspired roguelike deckbuilder, has hit 1 million sales within its first month of release. Publisher Playstack also revealed a mobile version is in development.
Created by solo developer LocalThunk, Balatro is a roguelike tasking players to play poker hands to fulfill score criteria and advance a series of rounds. Along the way, they’ll spend money to augment their deck with new cards with special effects while collecting powerful Jokers that bestow a wide range of passive and trigger abilities.  
The game has earned widespread acclaim and popularity since launching on February 20. I awarded it a 9.5 out of 10, writing in my review, “Balatro is an ingenious and entertaining roguelike and one of my favorite games of the year. Playing it has become a near-obsession; everything feels perfectly designed to encourage you to keep trying because that next run could be the run of your life. Even after hours of play, I still can’t overcome Balatro’s biggest challenge: putting it down.”


In a press release announcing the 1 million milestone, LocalThunk writes, 
“I'm so grateful to all the players and people that have made this happen. I still can't grasp the response to this game, and I am overjoyed that so many people have been able to have fun with my silly creation. I'm so fortunate that I can continue working on my passion as a career. Thank you!”
Balatro is currently available for PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC. There’s no release window for the impending mobile versions.]]></summary>

They should rebrand again and call it Riven: The Sequel To The Myst Remake.

Gone are the professorial waistcoat and bow tie of his angular 1992 incarnation, replaced instead by the grubby suit of a life-bruised 1930s noir PI, complete with hipflask of brandy for when the stress of being unaccompanied with the lights out gets too much.
Carnby isn’t the only one who’s transformed in this reboot of Alone in the Dark, the classic survival horror avant la lettre, either. Veterans will find plenty of callbacks and familiar names as they poke around its Louisiana manor house – talk of the Pregzt Shipping Company might raise an eyebrow, for instance, as may the gnarled tree filling much of the conservatory. But like these, everything here is remixed, rewritten, relocated. Indeed, Decerto house is no longer empty but a ‘home for the mentally fatigued’, while player characters Carnby and Emily Hartwood now arrive together, since she’s hired him to help check on her uncle, a long-term resident who may be in danger.

The 38-second long reveal trailer paints quite an enticing picture ahead of its Steam launch on March 29th, and that's not even the half of it either. For Valiant Tactics EX isn't just an anime Total War-like. It's also a whopping great deckbuilding game.

The program launches today in the Steam Beta Client and it replaces the Steam Family Sharing and Steam Family View features. 
Steam Families can have up to six members, and joining gives you access to any sharable games in each member's library. “Sharable games” is an important distinction, as Family Sharing is a feature that any developer can choose to opt out of for any reason at any time. Some games are also ineligible for sharing due to technical reasons. 
Noteworthy games currently eligible for Family Sharing include Helldivers 2, Baldur's Gate 3, Balatro, Cyberpunk 2077, Elden Ring, and Hogwarts Legacy. You can read the full list here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A heaving expo floor is not a great place to sample a first-person open world hunting game that wants you to monitor your own heartbeat, but The Axis Unseen manages to be pretty atmospheric regardless. It helps that I'm hunting Bigfoot. Hefting my magical bow, I peer around a tree trunk at the creature as he wanders down a slope of vivid orange grass sprinkled with pale blue rock. I only have a couple of arrows in my quiver, which doesn't feel like nearly enough, so I edge across the hillside to another tree trunk, where I can hopefully line up a headshot.

Why are people angry that this character has seven fingers? Why does Nvidia want me to talk to a robot about ramen? Why is everyone saying AI is smart when it still can’t manage its Classical Era luxury resource economy in Civilization properly? In this new series, we’re going to explore what 'generative AI' is, why it’s arrived now in the games industry, and what it might mean for people who make, write about and play games in the future.

While the start and end dates of the next closed beta haven't been unveiled just yet, we do know that there's going to be a new character to play, a new faction, new missions, and overhauls to the game's combat and exploration. I'd imagine it's worth a look if you're into Genshin Impact, or are into your anime fights. Either one will suffice.

Being able to play a game away from my PC can be handy. So it's neat that GOG have announced they're teaming up with Amazon to make select GOG games playable through the Amazon Luna cloud gaming platform "soon". Sure, I might be tempted to take a nice stroll through Night City while slouching about with my laptop that absolutely cannot run Cyberpunk 2077.

        <updated>2024-03-18T13:22:14.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Animal Well, the gorgeous indie metroidvania that will also be the first game published by Videogamedunkey's Bigmode, will hit PlayStation 5, Switch, and PC this May. More specifically, developer Shared Memory, which is just solo dev Billy Basso, revealed in a new gameplay trailer the game will launch on May 9. 
Dunkey revealed Big Mode, his own publishing arm, back in 2022, later announcing that Shared Memory's Animal Well would be the first game it publishes. Now, just shy of two years later, Animal Well will finally be in the hands of players in just a couple of months. 
Check out the Animal Well release date trailer for yourself below: 


"After nearly 7 years of development, Animal Well is finally almost ready to be released out into the world," Basso writes on X (formerly Twitter). "I have made this trailer to commemorate the occasion. I hope you like it. I don't really know what else to say." 
As you can see in the trailer above, Animal Well continues to look hauntingly gorgeous, and even kind of cute if you're a fan of spooky animals. We also get new glimpses of the game's metroidvania exploration, too, by way of a special yo-yo with a light that lures animals forward and more. Plus, there's a dog, which rules. 
Animal Well hits PlayStation, Switch, and PC on May 9.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Solo developer Billy Basso's enigmatic Metroidvania Animal Well has been dated for May 9th, publishers Bigmode announced yesterday. In it, you'll explore a vast labyrinth of tunnels, solve puzzles and escape its many mammalian-based horrors, all of whom  are out to gobble you up in one fell swoop - though as a strange, tiny little blob creature the size of a chicken nugget, it's unclear both what you are, and why exactly you're so appetising to them. Well, it probably has something to do with looking like a sentient chicken nugget, I suppose. Come and watch the release date trailer below.

On the upside, this should mean more chances topick up some quality PC gaming hardware on the cheap. Been putting off that new SSD or graphics card upgrade? Spring Deal Days is likely your best opportunity to exploit mass discounts until Summer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[SNK has released a new gameplay trailer for its upcoming fighter, Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves, revealing it's due out in "early 2025" as well. This trailer arrives roughly half a year after SNK formally revealed Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves in a trailer similar to today's, featuring Terry Bogard facing off against Rock Howard. 
That duo returns for another fight in the latest trailer, spotlighting the game's new "REV" system that features Rev Guard, Rev Blow, Rev Accel, and presumably more we'll learn about when the game is released next year. 
Check it out for yourself in the new Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves gameplay trailer below: 


Unfortunately, the trailer doesn't reveal anything else about the game, including platforms. Presumably, it will come to PlayStation and Xbox (possibly Switch), and PC. 
SNK will release Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves in early 2025.
In the meantime, check out SNK's original tease for the game from 2022, and then watch the Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves reveal trailer from last year. 
After that, catch up on Game Informer's thoughts on the latest fighting game releases:

My years of GDC left me devestated by the full realisation of how bad Mexican food is in the UK and I'm still not over it. Even the 'fancy' tacos and burritos you find nowadays cannot stand up to whichever burrito joint was closest to the BART station, especially as those were $7 and you'll pay £15 for a bad burrito here. Just. God. I miss them. I miss them so much. And the grackles. Anyway! What are you playing this weekend? Here's what we're clicking on!

Variety has more details about these crewmembers, including quick descriptions of each: 
Red – Captain of The Skeld
People-pleaser, blowhard

Fun fact: failed upwards
Purple  – Chief of Security
Safety, suspicion, sarcasm
Task: wet blanket
Fun fact: trust issues
Orange – HR
Spineless corporate shill

I've only seen three of them so far, out of its total of eight, but it's immediately obvious just how much of a step-up these places are compared to the dusty plains and rolling hills of the most recent Final Fantasy game to hit PC, FF15. An obvious take, perhaps, given that FF15 first came out eight years ago in 2016, but I'm sure anyone (all right, mainly me) who's ever despaired at Noctis' seeming inability to climb even the smallest hillock in front of him, or how everyone always rides right into your backside while gunning about on a chocobo, will feel some m…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Combat is such a routine activity in video games that it often doesn't feel much like conflict at all. It's just something done to move the simulation along - a propulsive chore stripped of drama or significance or lasting emotion beyond a vague desire to see what lies beyond whatever it is you're trying to kill. In Death Of A Wish, combat has substance: it's a form of redemptive self-expression. The game's fights are a means of asserting and cherishing yourself in the face of a world that regards you as a deviant, a world whose poison you carry on the inside.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dragon's Dogma 2 is right around the corner, launching on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC next week on March 22. Ahead of the game's launch, Capcom has released a new gameplay overview trailer with more than seven minutes of new footage; and perhaps strangely, it's narrated by actor Ian McShane (Deadwood, John Wick, Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides). 
Broken up into three sections in the video, McShane discusses "The Hero" of Dragon's Dogma 2, the "Two Nations," and, of course, "The Monsters" that players will be killing plenty of during their journey. 
Check it out for yourself in the Dragon's Dogma 2 gameplay overview trailer below: 


Dragon's Dogma 2 hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on March 22, 2024. 
For more about the game, read Game Informer's hands-on Dragon's Dogma 2 preview, and then check out this story about how Dragon's Dogma 2's main story campaign is about the same length as the first game. After that, read about how Dragon's Dogma 2 has an uncapped framerate but no visual presets or modes on consoles, and then check out this story about why Dragon's Dogma 2 has just one save file.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Senua's Saga: Hellblade II is right around the corner, hitting Xbox Series X/S exclusively on May 21, and ahead of the game's release, Ninja Theory has revealed it will have a dedicated photo mode. Plus, the studio released four new images of Hellblade II taken using the game's photo mode. 
While in-game photo modes are becoming the norm more and more with each new release, there are still some games that launch without one. With how good Hellblade II continues to look in trailers and screenshots, it's great to hear the game will feature this mode. 
Check out the four new Hellblade II images taken using the game's photo mode for yourself below: 

Based on the tweet revealing the photo mode, it sounds like players can expect it to launch with the game. 
"Photo mode returns in Senua's Saga: Hellblade II," a Ninja Theory tweet reads. "Here are some shot we took purely using photo mode in-game this week." 
Senua's Saga: Hellblade II hits Xbox Series X/S on May 21, 2024. 
For more about the game, watch the latest Senua's Saga: Hellblade II trailer, and then check out this gameplay trailer from December. After that, watch this other gameplay trailer for another look at the game's action.

It's one of those rereleases that exists mostly for modern consoles, made a bit useless on PC by the fact that you can still buy and fully play the originals for half the price. It's made even less useful by launching in a right wonky technical state, with bad lag, crashes, and reportedly only three 64-player servers online at first.

Last month, we learned that Embracer Group, the company behind the closure of Saints Row studio Volition Games and layoffs at companies like Black Forest Games and Eidos-Montréal, was reportedly set to sell Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic remake developer Saber Interactive. The deal apparently carried with it a $500 million price tag, according to a Bloomberg report. 
Now, it's official: Embracer has sold off Saber Interactive to a group of private investors under Beacon Interactive, as reported by VideoGamesChronicle. Beacon Interactive is controlled by Saber Interactive co-founder Matthew Karch, the publication reports.

Following the rough launch of Star Wars: Battlefront Classic Collection, which is an HD port combo of the original Star Wars: Battlefront and Star Wars: Battlefront II on modern consoles and PC, developer Aspyr Media says it's working to address issues and increase network stability. 
Shortly after the game's launch on March 14, players across all platforms (but especially PC), experienced server issues preventing them from getting into matches as well as other connectivity issues like disconnects, rubberbanding, and more once actually in a match. The result was a wave of disappointment from players excited to play these classic multiplayer games. Now, a day later, Aspyr has acknowledged the issues and is working to fix them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gameloft, the studio behind Disney Dreamlight Valley, has revealed it is partnering with Wizards of the Coast to create a new Dungeons & Dragons game. It's being developed for both consoles and PC and Gameloft describes it as an "innovative hybrid of survival, life simulation, and action RPG."
Disney Dreamlight Valley is popular in the life sim genre, mixing fun gameplay, unique customization, and Disney together into a package that players seem to really enjoy. It launched into Early Access back in 2022 before the full release debuted in December. All of this is to say: if you're a fan of Disney Dreamlight Valley and Dungeons & Dragons, there's a new game to keep an eye on. 
Currently untitled, Gameloft says in its announcement on Instagram that the game is set in the mythical Forgotten Realms, which is also the D&D setting Baldur's Gate 3 takes place in. The game, which will mix survival, life simulation, and action RPG elements into one, will feature "unique cooperative gameplay," the studio says. 
"Players can expect an adventure where the rich lore of this legendary franchise meets real-time strategy in a unique campaign of resilience, camaraderie, and danger at nearly every turn," the announcement reads." 
There's no name for the project and no release window either. Gameloft is currently hiring for the project. 
News of this D&D game arrives roughly a year after Wizards of the Coast, which owns the D&D IP and is a division within Hasbro, reportedly canceled five unannounced games. The last D&D game released was Dungeons & Dragons: Dark Alliance back in 2021 – read Game Informer's review of it here.

While Sega's Japanese social media account shared a photo of a Red statue standing alongside Sega's other mascots (see below), we haven't seen the acquisition impact the games to this point. That changed today, as Sega and Rovio announced a multi-game crossover event between Sonic and Angry Birds on mobile devices.
The crossover event even comes with its own storyline, which includes a plot to steal the Angry Birds' eggs that accidentally creates a portal between the world of Angry Birds and Sonic's world. Sonic, Red, and their friend groups must work together across five mobile titles to stop Dr. Eggman. The event will include new playable characters, cross-brand c…]]></summary>

That's according to a new "Notice of End of Sales" post on the game's Steam page. From Friday, March 29, 2024, onward, the game will no longer be available for purchase in Japan on the storefront. 
However, online play will remain available after the game's delisting, and purchased copies of the collection will remain available for re-download from the Steam store. 
Released less than two years ago on August 30, 2022, on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC, The Cowabunga Collection getting delisted so soon comes as a shock.

After starting Jagex in 1999, the Gower brothers focused their efforts on the studio's first big release: RuneScape. The rest is history. RuneScape is still a very popular game today, both in its modern form and as Old School RuneScape. The Gowers left Jagex in 2010 and little was known about what they were up to until now. It turns out Andrew Gower was working as the lead designer on their new game, while Paul Gower was working as the narrative designer for it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Ubisoft Montpellier's excellent metroidvania, Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, hit consoles and PC in January, and it's still one of Game Informer's top scoring reviews of the year. You can read Game Informer's Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown review here to find out why we love it so much. Now, Ubisoft is giving players another reason to jump back in with a new post-launch content roadmap. 
What's more, all of the new content coming to the game is set to release throughout the year, starting with new Speedrun and Permadeath modes this month as well as new outfits for Sargon. In spring, a Boss Rush will be released alongside even more outfits for Sargon, and in summer, the Divine Trials update brings new combat, platform, and puzzle challenges as well as new amulets, outfits, and more. All of this will be free, too. 
However, later in 2024, new paid story DLC will hit Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, although Ubisoft offers no teases about what to expect. 
It's an exciting roadmap, doubly so considering the majority of the new content is free.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Helldivers 2 developer Arrowhead Game Studios quietly snuck flying Terminid bugs into the game in the latest update, it seems. Windows Central noticed flying Shrieker bugs are enemies that appear on planets plagued with Terminids and while official accounts for the game play coy, more and more players are running into them. 
It seems the Shriekers were added with Patch 1.000.102, which went live yesterday. Coincidentally, that patch was centered on Terminids and nerfing spawn rates for Bile Titans and Chargers on the harder difficulties of Helldivers 2. Windows Central reports Shriekers only appear when a "Shrieker Lair" is one of the side objectives on a planet, noting they look like "smaller versions of the mushroom-like Spore Towers that perpetually keep a large area around them covered in a thick haze." 


Shrieker Lairs, like the Spore Towers and Terminid egg nests can be destroyed up close and from afar with a well-placed rocket, grenade, or strategem. 
Keep your eyes on the skies, Helldivers and remember...DEMOCRACY.
For more about the game, read Game Informer's Helldivers 2 review, and then read about a recent patch that introduced meteor showers and fire tornadoes to the game. After that, check out the Cutting Edge Warbond coming to the game tomorrow.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For the 17th time, ScummVM has again been accepted for the Google Summer of Code program this summer.
The program intends to bring new contributors into open source projects. In the most recent two years this has included both students and non-students as eligible candidates for participation.
Like last year, participants can apply for working on either short tasks (about 175 hours of work), or large tasks (about 350 hours of work). The coding period typically runs from start of June through August, but there is some flexibility which allows participants to have longer time frames if they are unable to work full time through the summer.
ScummVM is looking for people interested in participating in GSoC with us. A list of suggested projects can be found on this page, but we are also open to your own ideas as well. Please provide the required information in your application before submitting.
We also strongly encourage you to join our Discord server, in the #scummvm-gsoc channel. This allows you to engage with our mentors and the rest of the team, to get advice about how to get involved with the project, as well as writing your application.
Based on our previous 16 years of experience with GSoC, we have put together a Google Summer of Code miniportal to help you get started.
Looking forward to hearing from you!

In this post, you’ll get a peek behind the quite transparent curtain and learn more on how OpenTTD is developed.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you don’t know me, I’m Owen Rudge, and have been involved in the online Transport Tycoon community for almost 25 years. Exactly 21 years ago, I received an ICQ message (look it up, kids) out of the blue from a guy named Ludvig Strigeus (nicknamed Ludde). “Hello, you probably don’t know me, but I’ve been working on a project to clone TTD for a while.” he said, more or less. He didn’t want to release this to the public yet, and wasn’t entirely sure what he was going to do with it. (He’d been working on it since 30th June 2002, so I guess that is technically the birthday of what would become OpenTTD…) Ludde sent me a copy of what he’d been working on, and it was very exciting indeed. It was a fully functional version of Transport Tycoon Deluxe, written in C. Admittedly incomplete at that time, it was still quite remarkable.]]></summary>
