Mechanical keyboards are a staple of gaming these days — their tactility, durability, and customizability are perfectly suited for all of our gaming and aesthetic purposes. I personally prefer controllers, so I avoid gaming on a keyboard when I can, but as a writer, having a clicky-clacky keyboard scratches an itch in my brain that nothing else can. I love a full mechanical keyboard given the writing thing, but for gaming purposes, the left side is really all you need. If you find yourself lamenting the purchase of a full-sized keyboard to only use a third of it, Nordic Game Supply might just have the solution you're looking for. Enter The Shrimp keyboard, an "ultra compact mechanical keyboard" that only has 25 keys, which only includes the ess…]]></summary>

Even as Sony shares more details about PlayStation VR2, we've still wondered about the games, the timing, and crucially, the price. Today, the company narrowed in a bit — PlayStation VR2 is officially coming in "early 2023," according to a tweet from PlayStation.
https://twitter.com/playstationuk/status/1561840354290274304
It's a simple announcement tweet with just the new timeline and a familiar photo of the PS5 headset and VR2 Sense controllers, both of which have been shown off before. With Gamescom happening this week, this could be a lead-in for a wider announcement. Or it could just be another incremental news update, business as usual. You never know.
How much is too much?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Two days of free online multiplayer this weekend
If you're looking to steal cars, dunk some basketballs, or play some team deathmatch with your pals on PlayStation, this weekend's a good opportunity. PlayStation Plus is hosting a free online multiplayer weekend in a few days.
This coming weekend, August 27 and 28, PlayStation 4 and PS5 users will be able to play multiplayer on their games without needing PlayStation Plus. Traditionally, some games have their multiplayer gated by PS Plus. But those will have their doors thrown open for two days, for everyone to get a chance.
You do, of course, need to purchase the games themselves to actually play. You'll also need a PSN account, if you don't have one already.
https://twitter.com/PlayStation/status/1561714809128816640
It's not a big event for those already subscribed to Sony's offerings. But I can imagine at least a few folks might have let their subs lapse. This provides a nice chance to hop online and play some games in your library against others. Maybe you've been itching to pick Guilty Gear Strive back up post-Evo, or you just want to run around guns-blazing in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare? Either way, the multiplayer world's your oyster for two days this weekend.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7Ivdq5E-fs
On the Plus side
Sony has been gradually ramping up its Plus offerings in the wake of its new three-tiered plan. While the basic subscription still exists for those who want to just pick up the Plus games and play online multiplayer, a few higher-tier offerings give a little more access each month.
The Yakuza series, for example, is making its way over in its entirety over the course of this year. You'll need PlayStation Plus Premium to access all of them, though. The Premium tier also offers a ton of retro games, which PlayStation has been chipping into over time.

You drop in as a monster and mindlessly smash things until the game ends. Rampage: Universal Tour even had a hint of strategy in managing your stock of lives.
Rampage Through Time is the last of the games I had yet to play unless you count some portable ports. It only came out on the PS1 in 2000, having never received a port or re-release.

Thankfully, Sony hasn’t completely deserted mobile gaming fans, and has teamed up with Backbone to create the latest Backbone accessory controller for iPhone.

In Madden NFL 23, developer EA Tiburon focused on the fundamentals: authentic 11v11 football and cleaning up many of the bugs that plagued previous Madden iterations. The result is a small step forward for the franchise and a strong foundation to build on.
The most significant changes in Madden NFL 23 are under the surface. The team at EA calls it FieldSense, a shift to more physics-based interactions on the field. In practice, it’s a mostly positive change. Running the ball between bodies is chaotic and violent, true to the real-world g…]]></summary>

In a press release, the awards organization announced it will introduce Best Adaptation, a category for adaptations of video game intellectual properties into other media. This includes (but is not limited to) theatrical movies, streaming shows, podcasts, novels, and comic books.
This awards category could potentially include a number of different adaptations, though no nominees are locked in just yet.

PlayStation Productions seems to be on a roll with new projects, as another movie adaptation of a Sony IP is apparently moving forward. Deadline reports that a film based on Gravity Rush is in development.
According to Deadline, PlayStation Productions and Scott Free Productions have launched development. Anna Mastro (Secret Society of Second Born Royals) looks to be attached as director, with Emily Jerome on the script.
Gravity Rush is the pushing-and-pulling action-adventure series from Sony Japan Studio, where protagonist Kat can bend gravity to her will. She fights monsters, defends her hometown, and also does the occasional odd job for others.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMGaMOyr0GI
Deadline says it's not clear who will produce the Gravity Rush film as of yet. Distribution is also apparently unclear.
Rushing to the silver screen
Gravity Rush just adds to the rapidly growing list of PlayStation IP productions in development. Alongside the Gravity Rush film, we also heard from Deadline's report last week that Sony is planning on a Days Gone film.
It's not just film adaptations, either. Twisted Metal has a series in development, and reports of Horizon and God of War series have also popped up. Plus, The Last of Us just got a first-look clip in an HBO sizzle reel.
The Gravity Rush movie news is actually pretty exciting, as I personally think this series would make the jump to film pretty well. It's got a good basis for some cozy, feel-good, slice-of-life moments. And Kat's gravity powers could make for pretty exciting action setpieces.
There's the stinger of Sony Japan's down-scaling, though, as that deflates any of my hopes for some new Gravity Rush around this. Regardless, it looks like Sony is carrying on with adapting a ton of its properties into film and TV. It's anyone's guess as to what could or could not be next.

As HBO/WB/Cartoon Network continue to wade through the turmoil of the recent Discovery takeover, some shows do have full confirmations (or re-confirmations) for new seasons in 2023. We also finally got a real look at The Last of Us TV show, which is still due in "early 2023."
The clip opens up with Joel (Pedro Pascal) and Ellie (Bella Ramsey) walking up to a snow-filled bridge while ominous music plays. From there, we're greeted with an array of footage from the project, including plenty of footage of Pascal and Ramsey's performances, complete with voice-over. We even get to see a quick clip of Nick Offerman as Bill, and a tease of the disease that's running rampant through this universe.
It's a promising short look at the series, which will feature episodes written by Neil Druckmann, who is ostensibly the "showrunner" of the game series. His involvement has helped ease concerns about the inherent danger of game adaptations. Pascal has also mentioned in the past that he aims to give his own spin on Joel, and the footage thus far hints that we could see the series move in a different direction. So long as everything holds up, it'll be fantastic if the TV show is a companion piece of sorts rather than a carbon copy.
The Last of Us bit starts at roughly 1:40 in, and you can watch it below.

A My Nintendo Kirby keychain is in the pipeline and will come out in the near future, a new My Nintendo post has revealed.
In typical my Nintendo fashion it's only done in passing on a post about the greater Kirby franchise, but we do know the design (pictured here) and that it'll be celebrating Kirby's Dream Buffet. Typically, this means that the reward is roughly a week out. While there are no keychains currently for sale, they've ranged from 400 to 800 Platinum Points in the past.
If you don't want to wait, there's a printable (digital file) pop-up card for Kirby's Dream Buffet that you can get now. It'll cost you 30 Platinum Points. Nintendo also reminds everyone that the recent Kirby 30th anniversary concert is now online, and there's a Dream Buffet wallpaper reward available.
As a reminder, if you want physical rewards, you can find our full Platinum Point guide here, which has been updated with details on weekly missions: bookmark it for when you need quick points for a reward. A handful of points is incredibly easy to get, as that’s basically just 15 minutes with Super Mario Run, or a quick sign-on to the 3DS or Wii U 3Shop. Also remember that any shipments are bundled together, so you can pay a flat rate for multiple items instead of paying it each time. Just know that items go out of stock on My Nintendo frequently, and some are never restocked.

If you’re a long-time Nintendo Life reader, or a devout Kirby fan, then you might remember that time Nintendo opened a small chain of Kirby-themed pop-up restaurants across Japan – christened Kirby Café, appropriately enough – in 2016.
Beginning with its first temporary location in Osaka, that was quickly followed by two more in Tokyo and Nagoya. While all three locations only operated for a couple of months each, Kirby Café Tokyo popped up once again in 2018 and proved so popular with fans of the “powerful, pink puff” that it was ultimately reopened as a permanent establishment in 2019. Despite serving patrons for going on four years now (only two of which were during the fabled Before Times), Kirby Café Tokyo remains one of the most exclusive themed restaurants in all Japan – perhaps only rivaled by Kirby Café Hakata.

It certainly doesn't feel like it, because Zelda: Breath of the Wild is still relevant, but it's been the biggest gap between mainline Zelda games...ever.
Pointed out by Twitter user Geo, this is now the longest gap to date for the franchise, with Link's Awakening (SNES) into Ocarina of Time (N64) holding the previous record of five years, five months, and 15 days. They point out that mainline 3D entries generally take longer and longer with each release, with every game sequentially increasing development time through the new gap between Zelda games today.
As they point out, Zelda fans are generally willing to wait for quality, and I don't need to repeat the "delayed game" mantra once again as it's ingrained in this series. But the main observation stems from a lack of original "portable" games to aid the droughts. The last one we had was the Link's Awakening remake, which is decidedly not an original game. You can, however, make the case for Cadence of Hyrule, Skyward Sword HD, and Age of Calamity ensuring that the series hasn't remained dormant.
For a while, Zelda fans were eating well in terms of supplemental games backing major 3D releases. I mean Wind Waker into Minish Cap into Twilight Princess, then Phantom Hourglass/Spirit Tracks into Skyward Sword: that's a hell of a run. And Ocarina of Time 3D (a re-release) was just kind of thrown in there too!
While Breath of the Wild 2 will likely be the next major Zelda entry at this point with a planned 2023 release, I hope we get a Minish Cap-style wildcard to assist with the next wait.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A wild 2022 Fallout 76 deluxe edition appears
Thanks to QuakeCon, we now have a date for the Fallout 76 Pitt expansion: September 13. And on that day you can pick up a new Fallout 76 deluxe edition. Let's break down the details.
So the main event of The Pitt, which will be a free update for existing 76 owners, is expeditions. Framed as "large-scale repeatable missions," you'll trek to the actual Pitt (Pittsburgh) with up to four players to complete missions and locate items that you can take back with you. The Pitt will also feature a new currency (called stamps) that feeds into the repeatable and grinding nature of the additional setting.
Bethesda also shares how The Pitt is faring now, lore-wise: "Radiation and destruction have warped the once-great industrial city, with citizens mutating into vicious Trogs and a power struggle emerging between the blue-collar Union faction and the Fanatics, a power-hungry band of Raiders. Build an alliance with the Union and learn their background, earning new weapons and armor as you build a reputation with the Raider-besieged faction."

The Pitt Fallout 76 deluxe edition details
So there's actually going to be a new "The Pitt" version of the game in both standard and deluxe editions.
Here's what the digital upgrade bundle entails (all digital content):
Pittsburgh Neighborhood C.A.M.P. Kit
Fanatic Paint for the 10mm SMG
Trog Plushie
Fanatic Power Armor Paint
Fusion Core Recharger
You can also opt to get the digital upgrade bundle if you already own the game. It'll be coming to all platforms come September 13.

This time, it's in relation to a Blade game that Ubisoft are definitely not making. Rumours started circulating online yesterday when a YouTuber posted a video speculating about what possible games will be shown at the Disney and Marvel games showcase taking place next month. Ubisoft making a game based on Marvel's sword-wielding vampire Blade was one of them, and because the internet is the internet, everyone went wild. Today, though, Ubisoft have already killed the rumour dead in a single tweet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[His body is a motorcycle
While individual Pokemon reveals don't always do it for me, this Cyclizar showcase, compliments of the new Scarlet and Violet reveal from the Pokemon World Championships this past weekend, is too cute/weird to resist.
Here's the full lore rundown:
"This Pokemon has lived in many households in the Paldea region since ancient times. It has a mild disposition, and people riding Cyclizar are a very common sight. It appears Cyclizar don't mind being ridden because the warmth of a rider helps stave off the cold.​ Cyclizar can sprint at over 70 mph while carrying a human. Its extremely hard head and thick, lithe tail are not only useful for maintaining balance and absorbing shocks while sprinting—they also provide effective ways to attack during battles.​"

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zFq5nd0tU
One confirmed move it'll sport is shed tail, which allows it to create a substitute (classic), then swap with a combatant in your party. It's known as a "mount Pokemon," with dragon/normal types. It is absolutely going into my party as an early inclusion. While some creatures don't always make the final cut, I'll never forget party members like this that got me to where I needed to be by the time the Elite Four equivalent rolls around. And if they can evolve, even better!

It's not even Wednesday yet, readers! But don't worry, we're only delivering good news here; the famous Belgian comic series The Adventures of Tintin, penned by Hergé, is getting a brand new video game adaptation next year thanks to publisher Microids and developer Pendulo Studios.
Tintin Reporter - Cigars of the Pharaoh, based on the fourth Tintin comic of the same name, will see Tintin and his faithful Wire Fox Terrier Snowy investigate Pharaoh Kih-Oskh’s tomb. The comic is perhaps most famous for introducing regulars The Thompson Twins and naming Tintin's arch nemesis, Roberto Rastapopoulos — heck of a villain name, that.

While Deep Silver Volition’s “what if millennials, but crime” reboot is colourful and often quite pretty, you can tell it’s not nearly as interested in cutting edge visuals or contemporary PC tech trappings as the Spidey remaster is. Ray tracing? Yes but only for ambient occlusion. Upscaling? Never heard of it, officer.
The upside - besides Santo Ileso being a generally nice place to visit, as Alice Bee found in her Saints Row review - is that it's playable on low-end and luxury hardware alike. And, to its credit, there's a healthy list of customisable graphics options too. I’ve therefore embraced the past, and spent hours in testing to find out how you can tweak Saints Row’s settings for the best possible performance.

Volition was kind of between a rock and a hard place with Saints Row by the time Gat out of Hell came out. At that point, they had gone so far down the well of absurdity that it was impossible to climb back out. So when they revealed they were rebooting the series seven years later, it made perfect sense.
The decision to marry both new and old-school Saints Row concepts is a little bolder. That strategy isn't going to appeal to everyone, but there's plenty of wackiness to find in the open world.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There’s a long-standing theory among the Warhammer community that the chaos wastes at the globe’s south pole house a peculiar breed of beastmen in the form of evil, monstrous penguins. The theory is based on a world with similar geography to our own, and the tendency of the ruinous powers to morph local fauna into mockeries of their previous forms. No ping-gors show themselves as I trawl the southern wastes as stealthy chameleon-skink Oxyotl, but I find myself thinking about them all the same. Noot for the noot god, the blasted crags seem to whisper. Fish for the fish throne.
Evil penguins or not, all things seem possible with Immortal Empires, the combined landmass of the Total War: Warhammer trilogy into a single sandbox map, vast and varied in its climates, landmarks, and inhabitants. Creative Assembly have already dug deep into dusty stacks of White Dwarf to flesh out footnotes into full factions, and as the list of obvious additions dwindle, things can only get wilder and more creative. For now, we have one very big map stuffed with each faction and lord from three massive strategy games, creaking and occasionally buckling under the weight of its own promise. But it works. There’s a breadth of technical and balance issues still to solve, but the Immortal Empires beta is substantially more stable, playable, and enjoyable than I dared to hope it would be for at least another six months.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Saints Row series started off as a sort of rival to Grand Theft Auto, an action-adventure crime sim about working your way up the ranks of a street gang to become the boss. It quickly diverged to become less realistic and more impossibly bombastic, and niched down into giant dildo bats, aliens, reincarnation, and so on. The series has gone to outer space and to hell, so if you're rebooting the series that doesn't leave you many places to go except... backwards.
Saints Row (2022 edition) is back to being a sort of Saints Row again, but also still trying to appeal to people who loved the characters and dick jokes and cartoon carnage of the Saints Row of 2013. If I was being reductive, I'd say it's Saints Row by way of Watch Dogs 2. It isn't bad. It's fun, in fact, but it isn't really doing anything new, either, and I think that's a shame.

The Saints Row reboot features a new cast of characters and a different location to explore, but its heart and soul haven’t changed: Players can once again expect an exciting crime fest, giggle-worthy humor, purple splattered everywhere, and an open-world chock full of things to do and secrets to unearth. The game also has a knack for blowing everything up. In other words, it is great fun in that traditional Saints Row way and even better when experienced with a friend.

Pokemon Scarlet and Violet battle modes are at the forefront of a new update this past weekend, posted alongside of the game's new trailer.
Game Freak breaks down both casual and competitive angles, as the former will return with an anything goes "any Pokemon" setup, in which results are not recorded for posterity. Ranked battles will have sorted tiers of ranks, with the master ball tier serving as the top of the pops. Renting teams will allow folks to use IDs to both share and rent Pokemon based on teams that other trainers use. Oh, and you need Switch Online to use the battle stadium mode.
You can find a breakdown below.
Scarlet and Violet battle modes: Casual Battles
These are low-stakes battles in which results are not recorded. One appealing feature about these battles is that you can use any Pokémon.​





Ranked Battles
In these battles, you will be able to test your battle skills against Pokémon Trainers from all over the world. Your rank will change depending on your battle results. Trainers are sorted into tiers based on their ranks. If you can reach Master Ball Tier, the topmost tier, you'll have a chance to vie to be the best Pokémon Trainer in the world in fierce battles.

Last weekend, we found out about a new Avatar: The Last Airbender RPG through an Amazon Japan listing. Titled Avatar: The Last Airbender - Quest for Balance, nothing has been confirmed by the supposed developer GameMill at the moment. But Avatar fansite Avatar News states that it has seen the game, along with knowing when the game will potentially release. (Thanks, My Nintendo News!)
According to Avatar News' source, Quest for Balance will be launching on 8th November, which is barely over two months away. GameMill is indeed involved with the game along with Paramount's subsidiary Avatar Studios. And the game's story is reportedly set after the events of the show. The members of the Order of the White Lotus will get together to share stories of the end of the Hundred Year War — but it's not a straight revisit of the show, as some memories may be inaccurate or unreliable.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We've known HBO have been making a TV adaptation of everyone's favourite grim zombie apocalypse The Last Of Us for some time now, but aside from a few leaks and still images, we haven't actually seen it in action yet - until now. Late last night, HBO released the first official footage from the show, showing Pedro Pascal's Joel giving some serious lip to Bella Ramsey's Ellie, as well as a very quick peek at Bill, played by Nick Offerman. Slated to arrive sometime on our tellyboxes next year, have a watch of the trailer below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Pokémon Company and Nintendo have released a new trailer for Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet, and it showcases a new pocket monster and a few new moves targeted at the competitive play community. 
Released as the finale to the Pokémon World Championship held in London (watch our vlog of it here) over the past few days, the trailer is focused on battles, which makes sense given the nature of the event. In it, we get a look at a new Pokémon, Cyclizar, which looks very reminiscent of the two primary legendaries of this generation, Koraidon and Miraidon. Koraidon is the Scarlet legendary, and it seems rooted in the past whereas Miraidon, the Violet legendary, seems very futuristic. Perhaps Cyclizar represents the present. Only time will tell. 
Check out the trailer for yourself below: 


Beyond Cyclizar, the trailer also reveals a few new moves and items: 
Move: Shed Tail – Create a substitute, then swap places with a party Pokémon in waiting. 
Move: Tera Blast – Changes type when the user has Terastalized.
Item: Loaded Dice – Makes multistrike moves more likely to hit more times. 
Item: Mirror Herb  – Copies an opponent's stat increases when consumed. 

For more about Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, check out this preview detailing everything we recently learned about the Paldea region, new pocket monsters, and Terastalizing. Watch this trailer that welcomes trainers to the Paldea region of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, and then check out all the new Pokémon we spotted in that trailer. 
Are you excited about these new moves or do you think they're too disruptive to the meta of competitive play? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[HBO dropped the first glimpse of footage from its upcoming series, The Last of Us, in a surprise promotional trailer yesterday. 
The trailer runs roughly two minutes and it features new looks at shows like Succession, The White Lotus, House of the Dragon, and more. But then, at the 1:40-min mark, the trailer transitions its hype to The Last of Us. It's clear HBO is aware how excited people are for this series as it's given its own extended spotlight in the trailer. 
Check it out for yourself below: 


As you can see, not only do we get our first glimpse of footage from The Last of Us, but we also get to hear Bella Ramsey's Ellie for the first time as well as Pedro Pascal's Joel (and both are saying some pretty iconic lines from the game). What's more, we get a look at Nick Offerman's Bill and a quick shot of a clicker (well, a dead one that's grown to become part of a wall). 
Here are some screenshots from the trailer if you're after a closer look:

If you're rearing to jump back into the world of The Last of Us, good news: The Last of Us Part 1, a remake of the game this HBO series is based on, hits PlayStation 5 and PC this September. Check out this new trailer that compares The Last of Us Part 1 with the original game after that.

Hotta Studio have assured players it should all be sorted now, though, and that they can expect to receive their next bundle of freebies in the coming hours.

How many times have you thought, "yes, this dungeon crawler is great, but I wish there was the option to play as a cat"? Well, UnderDungeon, developed by Josyan, might be just the game to fill this retro feline-focussed hole in your gaming collection.
The newest release from publisher RedDeerGames will see you taking on Zelda-inspired dungeons as a delivery driver turned sword-wielding cat. Never mind their lack of opposable thumbs, UnderDungeon's hero is an armed-to-the-teeth warrior (which is exactly how we have always imagined cats see themselves anyway).

Live A Live is brilliant, and we're glad we finally got to experience it, but the game's director (and remake's producer) Takashi Tokita has revealed in an interview that the remake only came about because Nintendo asked if the game could appear on the Wii U's Virtual Console because some people working for the company really liked the game.
The interview (all in Japanese) was shared on ResetEra and summarised by user Jurben. This request from Nintendo encouraged Tokita and Square Enix to dig out Live A Live for the service in 2014.

It's been a banner couple of days for Pokémon fans as this weekend marked the return of the Pokémon World Championship. Like with most everything else that's fun in the world, the long-running tournament was postponed in 2020 and 2021 due to COVID-19. This was a year of change for the event with Pokkén Tournament DX making its final appearance at the show while Pokémon Unite and Pokémon Go both made their official debut. As the PWC is all about competition, the Pokémon Company used the occasion to debut a new trailer for Pokémon Scarlet & Violet that highlights some of the new items players can use to turn the tide of battle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zFq5nd0tU
The Loaded Dice item seems a tad unfair, but I have to say I'm excited about the possibilities something like Mirror Herb will have on my, admittedly, poor competitive Pokémon play.
If you're more into the Pokémon Trading Card Game than its video game brethren, there is news for you too. Pokémon TCG will be getting new cards based on Scarlet/Violet starting in 2023. I haven't been paying attention since Pokémon cards were red hot during the pandemic and guys with terrible YouTube channels would strip the shelves bare at Target and Walmart, but I hope these will be easy to find next year. Though, if this story about adults buying Happy Meals to get the Pokémon cards inside is anything to go by, you should probably start making plans now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCO94IFsY8M
As for the next Pokémon World Championships, during the closing ceremonies of the year's event, it was announced the 2023 showcase will be held in Yokohama, Japan, marking the first time the PWC will take place in Japan.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA['Forced Poking' some fun at video game marketing
I have nothing but respect and empathy for the poor souls who were tasked with creating the now infamous Forspoken "Talking to a cuff!" trailer.
The whole thing stinks of producer tampering. I imagine the original script might have had lead character Frey say "And oh yeah, I'm talking TO MY SLEEVE!", which would work fine in a cutesy, family Sci-Fi wort of way. But then the "Business Strategy and Branding Lead" came in and said "Oh no you can't say 'my' because those magic talking sleeves are going to be sold as NFTs to players across the world in 2024. We want everyone to feel like they can own one, not just Frey. And you can't call them 'sleeves' either because we're going to call the NFTs 'Tough Cuffs'. The SEO on that shit is pure dynamite."
And that's how Forspoken "Talking to a cuff!" trailer was (probably) born.
It was with that nightmare in mind that I've started posting new re-recordings of that god forsaken Forspoken dialogue every day until the game is released on January 24, 2023. That's 165 days, folks! 11 days in and I haven't missed an upload yet, though doing most of the acting on the videos on my own may make my brain melt soon enough.
You can find a thread of them in progress on Twitter, and for your convivence, my collaborators and I have compiled the best of them (so far) in the video below. They aren't all keepers, but I'm semi-proud of my Solid Snake and Louie Armstrong impersonations. Just listing to them is sure to make your throat sore with empathetic laryngitis.

Last Monday marked the 35th Anniversary of Metroid's release in North America for the NES, and we celebrated by compiling our "origins" stories for the franchise. This time, it's The Legend of Zelda's turn, with the debut title also celebrating its 35th Anniversary in North America tomorrow (22nd August). It's kind of crazy to think that Metroid and The Legend of Zelda came out so close to one another!
The Legend of Zelda is arguably Nintendo's most important franchise, garnering critical acclaim amongst both media and the public for its vast scale, charming cast of characters, and awesome gear-based gameplay. Despite remaining consistently excellent for most of its lifetime, Nintendo gave the franchise an extra boost in 2017 with the launch of Breath of the Wild, undoubtedly one of the most influential games of the last decade - if not all time.

Last week, we took a look at one of the GameCube's best and most important games: The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker. It was a pretty close race, too! North America and Europe teamed up to take on Japan, and although many loved the traditonal golden aesthetic of the game's western release, a few more preferred Japan's more vibrant, abstract approach.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[All of Black Myth: Wukong's trailers so far have looked stunning, but each one has focused on horrible monsters and combat with horrible monsters. Today's new trailer takes a different tact. It's a six minute-long cutscene in which some sisters discuss their mothers impending marriage, but it's no less beautiful to look at.

Plus, if you stick to the very end, you'll still get to see a new horrible monster.

"Well Cuphead and his pal Mugman, they like to roll the dice..."
If you're feeling nostalgic for the original Cuphead title screen, there's now a way to go back — a recent patch added a sneaky toggle, allowing Cuphead: The Delicious Last Course players to swap between the newer Ms. Chalice opener and the duo's classic tune.
To change the title screen music, go to the Options menu in Cuphead and look for a newly-added title screen setting in the Visuals section.

The new title screen for The Delicious Last Course

Both songs are great in their own way, but I have a soft spot for the original quartet vibe.
Patch 1.3.4 also cleans up minor issues
After seeing a notification, I was curious what was patched — that's the main inclusion.
That said, Studio MDHR also cleaned up some outstanding issues:
Fixed rare issue with Boatman dialogue being triggered after fast traveling.
Added ability to undo wishes.
Fixed localization issues.
Fixed minor animation issues.
Fixed minor audio issues.
Every so often, I see people post about glitches on Reddit, so they're out there. Aside from one or two animation hiccups (that never showed up again), I've been lucky so far.
Cuphead is one of those games I wish I could zap from my (admittedly feeble) memory so that I could go through it again, all fresh and ready for punishment.

Something very different from the old-school players at Hamster this week, as Namco's strange, science-fiction runner Metro-Cross joins the Arcade Archives — available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch.
Released to the arcade market in 1985, before receiving ports to a wide variety of home computers, Metro-Cross is a fast-paced, side-scrolling runner, predating popular such as Temple Run and Canabalt by a good few decades. Players guide a jumpsuited protagonist as they sprint down a hi-tech corridor laden with traps, hazards, and obstacles. The crazy sprinting action is automatic and unstoppable, with the player tasked with keeping our star from coming a cropper at the myriad objects that lay strewn in their path.
Check out the action in the video below, courtesy of YouTuber World of Longplays.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyTHqUgqu3k
In a crazy headlong dash against the clock, The Runner must dodge and/or leap over the obstacles, while picking up drinks to maintain their stamina and even boarding a handy skateboard in order to increase their momentum. Like so many fast scrolling titles of the day, Metro-Cross is a little dizzying, not helped by the game's checkerboard pattern, but it's an amusing oddity, and as such it's neat to see it added to Hamster's ever-growing collection of games that time forgot. A sequel, Aero-Cross, was being developed in the late-'00s for release on Xbox Live Arcade, but the game was ultimately canceled.
Metro-Cross is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at around $8.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You ever think about how short cats are?
Nothing makes a game feel fresh like looking at it from a different perspective. I'm not just being philosophical here — someone modded Stray so you can play the game in first-person. Personally, that might make me a bit motion sick with all the jumping and such, but if you're looking to replay and switch up your Stray experience, this mod might be the perfect fit.
Aptly named Stray - First Person Mod, it allows you to see the game as if you were the cat himself (or herself? I don't think I ever figured out what gender the cat is supposed to be in the game). The mod was created by a user named Jessica Natalia, and you can download it over on NexusMods (via The Gamer).
I could definitely see how the first-person perspective would make the experience more immersive, but it's better saved for at least a second playthrough considering many of the puzzles are better suited to a third-person view. Just based on the demo video of the Stray mod, though, it is pretty cool to see the world through a cat's eyes in a game that was designed for you to see the world from a cat's perspective.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iU2r1xwBZD0
As can be common with mods, there are a few bugs to be aware of with this one.
Nothing game-breaking, but the cat can become visible if you move quickly, or when walking too close to a wall which makes the camera pop out of place — this happens because the modder moved the placement of where the camera is situated to be where the cat's head is, rather than removing the cat's character model altogether.
Of all the games I've seen get first-person mods, I think it probably makes the most sense in Stray considering perspective is part of the game's narrative themes.
Now I'm just waiting for the Stray VR mod.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Don't let maps and bars get in the way of your perfect shot
I've been slowly whiling away the hours over the last few weeks with Xenoblade Chronicles 3, a fun and incredibly scenic RPG. And this week, I picked up a little trick that I wish I had known about from the get-go: a shortcut for easy, HUD-less Xenoblade screenshots.
In most games, I tend to be a screenshot fiend. Part of that is, well, part of the job; if I know I'm going to want to write about something later, having a bevy of good screenshots is useful. But I also like to catalogue my journey, remembering specific moments, lines, and vistas from throughout my time there.
Xenoblade Chronicles 3 has some good camera options, including one that lets you essentially go full-on first-person mode. But Nintendo of Europe tweeted out this handy tip that changed my Xenoblade screenshot life for the better. If you press the L and R buttons simultaneously, you can easily snap a screenshot without the heads-up display.
https://twitter.com/NintendoEurope/status/1559132800028233729
After seeing this, I went directly into my game and started trying it. And indeed, it's basically a macro. The game dips out the HUD, snaps a screenshot, and re-ups the display. It's startling how well this works in real-time; I was a little worried I'd have to give it a bit of lead time, but no, it happens pretty darn fast.
A photo album of adventure
Now I've been revisiting all the places I blew through in my early hours of Xenoblade Chronicles 3 to get new screenshots. Capturing some of the massive landscapes, beautiful views, and colossal sights makes for a fun diversion from the main plot.
It helps that Xenoblade Chronicles 3, on top of being quite a good game, is also a very scenic game. It feels like Monolith Soft ekes incredible views out of the Nintendo Switch, and now, I've got a great tool for preserving them without too much fuss.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let’s rock, baby! Season 6 of Video Gameography gets stylish as we examine the Devil May Cry series! Over the next few weeks, we’ll be covering the history and lore of Capcom’s premiere action franchise. Today we examine the franchise's boldest, most divisive, but arguably strongest entry yet in DmC Devil May Cry. 
Desiring to shake up the series, Capcom turned to British studio Ninja Theory to reboot and reimagine Devil May Cry. Encouraged by the publisher to be as wildly creative as possible, the team behind Heavenly Sword and Enslaved: Odyssey to the West dreamed up a grittier version of Dante who inhabits Limbo City, a world existing in parallel with the demonic realm. This relationship spectacularly manifests in the city itself coming to life, shifting its buildings and roads to hinder and assault the demon slayer. 
Sporting jet black hair and the ability to tap into angelic and demonic powers, this new vision of Dante garnered heaps of vitriol from fans who saw DmC as too drastic of a departure, despite the game launching to rave reviews. In this episode, we'll examine how DmC came to be, the role Capcom played in the game's wildest ideas, Hideaki Itsuno's reaction to the project, the backlash Ninja Theory endured, and give our overall impressions of the narrative and gameplay. 
Join hosts Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), former GI editor John Carson (@John_Carson), and with special guest Bob Buel (@bobbbackwards) of the 99 Questions podcast as we unpack and pay respects to Ninja Theory's memorable stab at Devil May Cry.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new movie could be just around the Bend
It looks like another silver screen Sony adaptation could be on the way. Deadline reports that Sony is currently working on a movie rendition of Days Gone, its post-apocalyptic zombie game with bikers.
According to Deadline, Sam Heughan (Outlander) is "circling" the project and screenwriter Sheldon Turner is adapting. Turner and Jennifer Klein are reportedly set to produce, along with Sony PlayStation Productions.
In case you've forgotten, Days Gone is Sony Bend's biker-zombie action game. Released in 2019, Days Gone was like a mixture of The Walking Dead and Sons of Anarchy, following Deacon "Deke" St. John as he tries to survive in a zombie-infested Pacific Northwest.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-Ztt2bXI64
Deadline reports that it's heard Turner's script will be a "love ballad to motorcycle movies." Which, well, lines up with Days Gone for sure.
Video game theater
If plans go through, this will mark another in a growing catalogue of Sony's video game adaptations. Uncharted pulled in some solid numbers, even if the reception seems mixed. And HBO's The Last of Us is on the horizon, turning Joel and Ellie's cross-continental adventure into a miniseries that hopefully won't be disrupted by whatever the heck is going on over there right now.
Of the many Sony properties still around, Days Gone certainly seems like it could draw in a more mainstream movie-going audience. It's got bikers, zombies, and grit. You could probably have some pretty sick action sequences with massive "Freaker" hordes and revving motorcycles.
We'll have to see if this particular Sony production ends up moving forward or not. There are a few others, like the Twisted Metal adaptation, that are also in the works. Plus, the Ghost of Tsushima film, the Horizon series at Netflix, and projects for Gran Turismo and God of War. Sony's screen adaptations have only just begun, it seems.

When Arkane announced its new open-world shooter, Redfall, I think it's safe to say that we were all pretty excited, even if we don't know exactly what to expect. Well, the studio is helping us out on that front, because they've just released a deep-dive interview in conjunction with Xbox as part of QuakeCon 2022 that provides players with all kinds of details as to what it'll be like to play Redfall, including environments, character skills, and weapons. (Thanks, PC Gamer.) The Redfall interview included Arkane studio director Harvey Smith, as well as creative director Ricardo Bare and art director Karen Segars.
The team touched on just how big Redfall's open world is going to be for players to explore. Segars said that the space …]]></summary>

With just about a month until it launches, The DioField Chronicle will join a growing list of tactics games launching this year. If you've played the demo already though, you'll know DioField stands out in a few ways: its art, its design, and the way it utilizes real-time strategy on the field.
We had a chance to chat with the developers behind The DioField Chronicle, to learn more about why they went this direction. The team did anticipate a few strategy RPGs to be coming out close to this game. And according to producer Shigeyuki Hirata, the plan was for DioField to stand out.

Pre-load for the Splatoon 3 Splatfest World Premiere demo are now live. Those who want to dive in and ink some turf next weekend are able to get their app loaded up now.
Though this lets you pre-load the game, the Splatfest demo for Splatoon 3 will not be open until the specified window. So if you're hoping to get in a week early, you're out of luck.
The Splatfest World Premiere runs from 9 a.m. PT to 9 p.m. PT on Saturday, August 27. The one-day event will see Inklings and Octolings pick sides in a three-way turf war, hosted by the idols of Deep Cut.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiuIZN0KDFQ
The three teams are Rock, Paper, and Scissors. From 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. PT, the action will carry on as usual; teams will fight each other in the usual Splatfest turf bouts.
Then, halfway through the day, it all shifts around. The game mode swaps to the Tricolor Turf War, with three teams fighting at the same time. The leading team will try to defend its turf and hold control of the Ultra Signal, while the other two trailing teams storm in to try and throw the leader off.
A three-way turf war
Aside from settling the great debate of Rock, Paper, Scissors, this will also be a chance for players to get some hands-on time with Splatoon 3.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtMOAvOWTvY
Last week, we got a full Direct on Splatoon 3, showcasing all the features and updates coming to the third iteration of this squid-based shooter. From big additions like an entire new tabletop card game to small ones like an always-open Salmon Run, seems like a lot's on the way for Splatoon. This Splatfest demo will be the opportunity to try out new weapons, new moves, and get a feel for how the turf bouts will go down ahead of launch.
Splatoon 3 goes live for Nintendo Switch on September 9, 2022. Grab the Splatfest demo on the eShop here.

Spelunker may be considered by the Japanese to be a “densetsu no kusoge” or “crappy game of legend,” but I consider myself a fan. It wasn’t bad, it was just sort of a jerk. It made bank in Japan, but it then started filling up the bargain bins. So, you have to wonder what led to the development of Spelunker’s sequels: Spelunker II on arcade and, confusingly, Spelunker II on Famicom. Were they trying to make more money off the name, or were they trying to continue the legacy by making a worse game?
I don’t have an answer to that question, and by the end of this article, I still won’t have an answer. Spelunker II: Yuusha he no Chousen on Famicom isn’t terrible. It’s not great, but I’ve played much worse. More strikingly, it has very little to do with the original …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You know what it's like at the beginning of a new year. You're all excited about the many tens and hundreds of new video games coming out over the next 12 months, and you go and make a big list of all the ones you're really looking forward to. We did exactly that back in January of this year, coming up with a list of our 43 most anticipated games of 2022. Lately, though, it seems we can't go a single day without word of yet another game being delayed, whether it's just by a couple of months, or that it's been taken off the calendar entirely.
It got me thinking. How many of those 43 games are even still on the table this year? And, more importantly, what does that mean for RPS as we head into the back-end of 2022? Well, I went back and counted, folks, and it's not great reading. At time of writing, just over half that number - 27 in total - are still slated for a 2022 release right now, although with many still listed as a very vague '2022' or 'Coming Soon' on their Steam pages, I wouldn't be surprised if that number fell further. Needless to say, I'm not sure 2022 will go down as one of the great gaming years... 2023, on the other hand? Wow, that's looking rad.

The Founder’s Packs for MultiVersus came in three forms: a $39.99 standard edition, a $59.99 Deluxe edition, and a $99.99 Premium edition. These packs could be purchased to grant players things like character tokens for instant fighter unlocks, exclusive banners, and the premium in-game currency, Gleamium. It seems these packs sold extremely well in the U.S. as they brought in enough money to make MultiVersus the best-selling title in the U.S. in July, according to the latest NPD numbers.

Interplanetary 4X Stellaris has been evolving for more than six years now, having first released on May 9th 2016. Unusually, I remember exactly when I bought the game, because it was in the days just before my partner and I welcomed our first child. Being a ginormous sci-fi nerd, I enthusiastically downloaded it thinking I’d have all the space-time in the universe to invest in building my own interstellar superpower.
I did dip my toes in back then, and have many, many times since, but rather naively didn’t foresee the inevitable. The structure of my life altered dramatically with the arrival of our baby. It didn’t stop there either, and still hasn’t, taking on some unfamiliar but just about recognisable form every few months. I suspect the developers of Stellaris had a similar feeling following the game’s release into the wider universe, like Kubrick’s giant cosmic infant at the end of 2001: A Space Odyssey. I know I’ve felt like my furniture’s been rearranged whenever I’ve started a new game of Stellaris with a different civilisation over the intervening years.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As expected, the Dragon Ball Adventure creative island is now live in Fortnite, and you can glide your way onto it right now. 
Once there, players can explore iconic Dragon Ball locations like Kami’s Palace, Goku’s house, and the Room of Spirit & Time. Plus, players can duke it out in the PvP battle arena, “Tenkaichi Budokai.” 

“We’re thrilled to partner with Epic Games and bring this first-ever Toei Animation franchise integration to Fortnite,” Toei Animation Inc. director of global marketing, Lisa Yamatoya, writes in a press release. “Over the last 36 years, the Dragon Ball franchise has built perhaps the largest global fanbase of any anime. And this multi-generational mainstream audience makes Dragon Ball ideally suited for a collaboration with Fortnite and its worldwide community of players. We’re excited to see the response to Dragon Ball’s arrival in Fortnite.” 
Epic Games notes that, in case you missed it, there are already Dragon Ball creative islands available in the game for you to visit. There are multiple Dragon Ball Super Episode Festival islands, and from now until Sept. 17, you can board a cruise ship and watch select episodes from Dragon Ball Super on them. Both these islands and the new Dragon Ball Adventure island were created by Vysena Studios.
What do you think of this Dragon Ball x Fortnite collaboration so far? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

You know, the sorts of weapons that don't just spew bullets but generate portals or even clean filth off car bonnets.

Immediately, internet sleuths deduced that the landscape in question looked suspiciously like Death Stranding, leading many to believe it was a teaser for Kojima's hiking postal sim appearing on the subscription service. And yep, they were right on the money, with confirmation arriving today that the BB Boys will be pulling into Game Pass next week, on August 23rd.

I've spent some time with the game's early levels and it perfectly captures what I'd consider to be a 'classical' Soulslike: a game that's heavily focused on The Combat Bit above all else.
Does the game's combat rule? Yes, without a doubt. But will I continue playing? I'm not so sure. From what I've sampled, one strong pillar might not be enough to hold my attention for much longer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Golf games seem to be having a bit of a renaissance right now. From their beginnings on the fairway fringes of Flash-game forums, we now have been blessed with a handful of fun indie golf sims. We’ve seen the bizarre buffoonery of What The Golf?, the high-speed, eye-popping courses of Golf With Your Friends, and Secret Mode recently completely threw the clubs out the window and replaced them with highspeed motorcars in Turbo Golf Racing.
It's safe to say that golfing games are always full of shenanigans and Cursed To Golf is no different. Playing as a golfer who has been cast into Golf Purgatory, you need to golf your way back to the land of the living, completing all eighteen holes in one roguelike run. It’s a fun premise and the game bursts with silliness and personality, but unfortunately Cursed To Golf fails to iron out certain roguelike frustrations. After mistiming a shot in the game’s final area and being sent back to the beginning (ending an excruciating four-hour run time), I truly did feel cursed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Soldier Boyz is the newest supported game of the Hypno engine, and it’s ready for public testing!
Released in 1997 by Hypnotix and published by DreamCatcher Interactive and MCPA Interactive, this full-motion rail shooter is based on the 1995 film of the same name. The game starts when the daughter of an American billionaire is kidnapped by a group of Vietnamese terrorists. Then, it’s up to Major Howard Toliver, ex-Marine and highly decorated Vietnam veteran, to gather a deadly team for the dangerous mission of rescuing her. He recruits six prison inmates serving life sentences for a chance at a full presidential pardon.
Keep the body count rising to survive five territories by playing as each Soldier Boy (and Girl),
but beware and don’t waste a “friendly” since they provide vital survival information!
ScummVM currently supports the English release of the game (which is the only one we know about) and features more responsive controls than the original. We couldn't find a demo but there is a trailer. Please contact us if you have a demo or any other release.
To play the game with ScummVM, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[High On Life, the upcoming first-person shooter from Justin Roiland's Squanch Games, has been delayed. 
Originally due out this October, High On Life will now hit Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC on December 13, 2022. It joins various other games delayed this week like Planet of Lana and Evil West, and for a similar reason: the team needs more time to make this game the best it can be. 
Here's the studio's statement about the delay, in full: 
"We have good news and bad news. Feel free to choose the option you'd prefer to read first; we won't meddle with your free will. 
The Good News: High On Life is still coming in 2022! The team at Squanch Games is working hard towards developing the best gaming experience to hit your screens, and a little extra time to squash some bugs never hurts. With that in mind, our new launch date is set to December 13, 2022.

The studio says it's aware fans loved Seasons in Diablo II: Resurrected and Diablo III and have asked for even more seasonal support. Diablo IV will feature Seasons, and the first will be available soon after launch. Plus, Blizzard will have a team dedicated to Seasons that will bring players up to four seasons a year, each with major new features, questlines, enemies, legendary items, and more.

That’s a fun headline to read, right? And it’s true because after teasing earlier this week that Kojima Productions’ Death Stranding was coming to PC Game Pass, Xbox announced that it hits the service next week. 
More specifically, Death Stranding will hit PC Game Pass next Tuesday, Aug. 23. Now, this might be somewhat surprising for those not caught up on Death Stranding’s journey from PlayStation 4, to PlayStation 5, and then PC. Sony and PlayStation funded Kojima Productions’ development of Death Stranding, and it’s a PlayStation intellectual property. 
However, a PC port was published by 505 Games, and it seems 505 Games and Kojima Productions are free to determine the whereabouts of the PC port of this game. As such, it’s now coming to PC Game Pass, a service owned by…]]></summary>

This was nothing to do with the file itself; even being near another laptop playing the song could cause a crash. According to Microsoft, one of the sonic frequencies in Rhythm Nation coincided with the natural resonant frequencies of a particular laptop hard drive, making it crash. Amazing. Perfect. A perfect bug.

The group of bounty hunters gathers in their favorite bar once more. For the first time, protagonist Ringo pays attention to the lush cherry blossom decoration over the rooftop. Her friends say the real ones are even more beautiful and laugh at the idea of a bunch of Devil Summoners having a picnic and watching the flowers. The friendly mockery leads to a funny yet endearing message: “I think we oughta show Ringo the fun side of being human, don’t you?” Sadly, Soul Hackers 2 doesn’t seem to agree with the sentiment.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dead Island 2 is arguably one of the most anticipated games locked behind the fiery gates of development hell. The first game dropped over a decade ago, and ever since, zombie-slaying fans have yearned for a sequel. Well, they're in luck. A Dead Island 2: Day One Edition positing was spotted on Amazon with box art, in-game photos, and a 2023 release date. The new info was taken down, but we made sure to grab the images and extra deets for you. 
According to the info on the Amazon page, Dead Island 2 will be available on both Xbox and PlayStation consoles. However, current-gen versions of the game don't have web pages yet. The story follows an elite squad that's immune to the infection, meaning we'll be seeing 8-player co-op when the game drops. The full summary reads as follows:
Players must craft zany weapons like in the first game to defeat the seemingly never-ending hordes plaguing the West Coast. Deep Silver and Dambuster Studios' gory adventure allegedly launches on February 3, 2023 (or at least that's what appeared on the listings earlier today before suddenly disappearing). Hopefully, this date holds up/reemerges as we move into the new year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Inkulinati is a imagiative strategy game first announced in 2020 that brings the distinct art of medieval manuscripts to life. The game unfolds within the parchment itself as players control humans, animals, and mythical creatures to battle it out in turn-based battles that are equal parts thoughtful and ridiculous. Inkulinati has looked promising every time it’s made an appearance, and we can finally see how it's shaping up thanks to an upcoming early access launch. 
This winter, players can dive into Inkulinati on Steam Early Access and Xbox Game Preview. The game puts you in the role of Inkulinati, a being capable of using the magical Living Ink to bring illustrations to life. The irreverent battles unfold within an open book as players command units to strategically slice, bludgeon, and even fart opponents into submission to clear the way and topple the opposing Inkulinati. 


In addition to recruiting humans, rabbits, cats, snails, and other critters, you can enlist the aid of real-life literary figures such as Dante Alighieri. Each unit sports its own unique traits with more team members unlocked by playing. Stages promote different playstyles, with some requiring a more tactical approach and others a more aggressive assault. The game features a single-player campaign, and you can challenge friends in 1-on-1 battles.
And for those wondering: yes, this is a different game than Pentiment, Obsidian Entertainment's recently announced narrative adventure game that shares the same artistic influences.  
Inkulinati will be available first on Xbox and PC, but a Switch version is also planned with other platforms in consideration. The game will be playable at the Xbox booth during Gamescom next week.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Square Enix have made a vast array of RPGs over the years, but rarely have they ventured into the realm tactics and strategy games. A couple of big names come to mind, the obvious one being Final Fantasy Tactics, Tactics Ogre if you count their PSP remake of Quest's SNES original, and most recently, Triangle Strategy on the Switch. Outside of that, though, it's all a bit barren, which is why the real-time tactical sword-swinging of their upcoming strategy RPG The DioField Chronicle is such an interesting landgrab for them. To say they're pushing into new territory would be an understatement. 
Happily, judging by the sizable first chapter of the game (currently available to play for free on Steam until the game's release on September 22nd), it's clear that Square Enix and their development partners at Lancarse have a lot of smart decisions here. With its focus on individual hero characters instead of nameless military units, mixed in with the magical pizazz and flashy summons of its Final Fantasy games, The DioField Chronicle could just be the Fire Emblem-shaped hole PC players have been looking for.

MinnMax's Ben Hanson interviewed Christofer Sundberg, co-founder of Avalance, who has since left the studio to start a new company, Liquid Sword. During the interview, Hansen asked Sundberg about the fate of the Iron Man project, which Sundberg revealed as being in development for a year and a half to two years before being canceled due to what he describes as "company politics."


Sundberg reveals that Disney wanted Avalanche to rapidly expand its staff to finish the game under a shortened development timeline. However, he refused, explaining that doing so would have put a massive strain on the studio.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Another one bites the dust. If you haven't noticed, a number of high-profile delays have occurred in recent weeks, with many upcoming games pushed into next year. Unfortunately, the promising sci-fi platformer Planet of Lana joins that growing hit list.
Planet of Lana was first announced at E3 2021 with a 2022 launch window. The game stars Lana, a young girl, and her adorable cat-like companion Mui on a combat-free mission to preserve a serene planet occupied by robots and other creatures from corruption. Developer Wishfully Studios wants this cinematic puzzle platformer to make a big splash, announcing it’s pushing the release to spring 2023 to do so. 
Planet of Lana will be playable at Gamescom next week, so attendees have the opportunity to see how the game is shaping up first-hand. The title is slated to launch on Xbox consoles (including Game Pass) and PC.
If you're losing track of every big game to slip into 2023, this handy list should serve as a nice reminder.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Luca Le Fae has had it. His work as a writer for Leviathan Games, one of the biggest game developers on the planet, may pay well, but it’s creatively unfulfilling. A fateful encounter with his old acquaintance, Jey Zhang, at a party may just provide Luca with the escape he has been looking for. Jey, a successful music producer, remembers Luca as an incredible songwriter and asks him if he has any samples he could send her. Suddenly the unthinkable, a single, an EP, perhaps even actual stardom, seems within Luca’s grasp, but life has a tendency to get in the way even when you’re ready to take the chance of a lifetime.
We Are OFK can be described as a 3D visual novel or a mildly interactive five-part TV series you just happened to buy on Steam. The first two episodes are available on launch day, with episodes three to five releasing weekly after the game's initial release. Each one comes with its own opening, which really sells the feeling of catching a new episode of a miniseries each week. With each episode, you follow the story from a different band member's point of view, from their initial decision to be band-adjacent to taking their first wobbly steps in promoting themselves as artists. Joining Luca on his journey are pianist Itsumi Saito, who works in social media management at Leviathan, and Luca’s housemate Flores, an audio-visual effects artist.

The presentation is generally on par with E3 or Summer Game Fest when it comes to delivering significant news, and we now know a few of the major titles that will appear.
The Summer Game Fest Twitter account revealed that ONL will feature world premieres for Sonic Frontiers, Hogwarts Legacy, The Callisto Protocol, and Return to Monkey Island. That usually means we’ll get new trailers for each game, whether they be gameplay, story, or both. Of course, other titles will be shown as well including Dying Light 2’s Bloody Ties DLC and Telltale Games' The Expanse. 
Next Tuesday, @geoffkeighley hosts @gamescom Opening Night Live from Germany.

Hogwarts Legacy was recently delayed to February, and this will be our first look at it since its gameplay reveal in March. Sonic Frontiers and The Callisto Protocol both graced Game Informer’s cover the last couple of months, and this may be one of the last big marketing pushes before they arrive later this year. Return to Monkey Island, also slated to launch this year, may get a firm release date as well.  
Gamescom Opening Night Live will be streamed on August 23. The two-hour event begins at 11 a.m. Pacific/2 p.m. Eastern.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Time has never been very kind to QUBE. The first-person puzzler first began life as a university project in the late 00s, but by the time it finally launched commercially in early 2012, it was almost universally written off as nothing but an okay Portal clone. In fairness, there was a lot working against it. Like Portal, it was set in a largely white, sterile testing facility, and while it didn't involve flinging boxes through portals, each one of its puzzles did revolve around manipulating brightly coloured blocks to progress to the next room. The one major thing it was lacking, and probably a large part of why it never really stacked up to Portal at the time, was a GLaDOS-sized villain. QUBE's story would come later, in the 2014 Director's Cut, which added an entire script, voice-acting and a revamped musical score to give Toxic Games' puzzler a bit more, well, shape.
Even with all those extra flourishes, though, the Director's Cut was still the same QUBE puzzles from before, leading many to write off the update yet again as a slight improvement on the original, but nothing to get too excited about. Now, in 2022, QUBE is getting a fancy 10th Anniversary Edition that rebuilds both versions of the game from the ground up, while also adding an entirely new sector that doubles the length of the game. And I'm telling you: please don't write off QUBE for the third time in its life. It deserves better than that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dying Light 2: Stay Human was released earlier this year and since then, the team has continued to pump new content into the expansive parkour RPG. However, that content so far has been related to cosmetics, in-game parkour races, or other gameplay mechanics. Techland has yet to release anything new that pushes the story of Dying Light 2 forward. 
That could change soon as Dying Light 2's first story DLC, Bloody Ties, will get the full worldwide premiere treatment at Gamescom's Opening Night Live, which is hosted by Geoff Keighley and airs August 23. To tide fans over until then, the studio has released a teaser trailer that you can watch below: 


"What dangers await?" a press release reads. "How can you beat them? What will you get in return? One thing is certain...it will be brutal." 
As you can see, the DLC seems to hint at a brutal faction within the City, perhaps one interested in gladiator-style arena combat. Only time will tell what Bloody Ties entails, but fortunately, we don't have to wait too much longer now. 
For more, read Game Informer's Dying Light 2 review and then read our interview about the future of Dying Light 2.

Tower Of Fantasy pulls from a neighbouring gacha vending machine, except that its mixture of MMO, realtime combat, and lootboxing isn't wrapped up in as consistent a package.

But the update also adds a new SteamVR Home setting that – and I quote, with emphasis Valve’s - "showcases CT scans of actual dead bugs we found lying on the ground outside our office." See? The Valve Index isn’t just for playing Half-Life Alyx, eh.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Kilter Films, Bethesda Game Studios, and Amazon Studios announced in 2020 that a Fallout television series was on the way.
Not much has been revealed about it since then, other than a report from 2021 that detailed the show as a “gonzo, crazy, funny adventure.” However, images from the production’s set have begun to leak online, as reported by Eurogamer, and the show looks true and accurate to the famed video game series. 
Check them out for yourself in the tweets below:

The level of detail on this Amazon Fallout series 🔥 pic.twitter.com/fou1UL1vhs
August 17, 2022
As you can see, the vault looks pretty spot-on, as do other details like the Vault-Tec logo. Even the vault suits look amazing, although, as the person who snapped that image mentioned, they are a little different from what we’re used to in the games. Nonetheless, my excitement for this series has grown considerably since seeing these images. Hopefully, this same attention to detail has been put into the writing. 
There is no release date for this series.

"Sometimes we just like a good landscape picture," they said enigmatically. If you’re familiar with the Game Pass Twitter accounts, they like to do the flippant social media thing and tease followers. Well, this latest attempt has people speculating that the Sony-trademarked Death Stranding is about to hit PC Game Pass.

Originally due out this September, the game has now been delayed to November 22, 2022. Fortunately for those excited about the rootin’ tootin’ action of slaying vampires and killing other various (terrifying) creatures, this delay only pushes the game back by about two months. As for why, publisher Focus Entertainment released a statement on Twitter explaining that it’s the result of the team wanting the game to be the best it can be at launch. 
Here’s the studio’s statement, in full:

August 16, 2022
Evil West first premiered at The Game Awards 2020, and it immediately caught my attention. It gave me big Darkwatch vibes, a game I loved on PlayStation 2, and the first gameplay we saw at The Game Awards 2021 last December confirmed those vibes. If you’re looking for more of the game, you’re in luck because, in June, the studio released more than 10 minutes of new gameplay. 
Are you excited about Evil West? Let me know in the comments below! Also, if you played Darkwatch, that game was dope, right?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Guild Wars 2 celebrates its 10th anniversary this month, and ArenaNet is celebrating by introducing the MMORPG to a new audience on Steam. 
On Tuesday, August 23, Guild Wars 2 will be available on a third-party platform for the first time ever. Since its launch in August 2012, the game has only been accessible through ArenaNet’s proprietary launcher. Guild Wars 2 on Steam will retain its subscription-less, free-to-play model. Additionally, Steam players and those on the original client will play together on the same servers. If you’re a newcomer wanting to catch up on a decade’s worth of content, a $99.97 Complete Edition of the game for Steam bundles Guild Wars 2’s three expansions and all five seasons.
ArenaNet is introducing Twitch Drops. Now you can earn exclusive in-game character outfits, experience boosters, and a special Glowing Purple Mask cosmetic by watching streamers play the game from August 23-28. 


“Guild Wars 2 has delighted over 16 million players for a decade with its subscription-free business model, epic collaborative open-world boss encounters, and revolutionary mount system,” said Kendall Boyd, Senior Vice President of Marketing at NCSOFT West. “By launching on Steam, a whole new audience of players who have never had the chance to adventure with us will be able to experience one of the greatest fantasy worlds in gaming. Everyone at NCSOFT and ArenaNet is excited to welcome them into our amazing community.”
Guild Wars 2 has been hailed as one of the best MMOs of its time. ArenaNet has supported the title with seasonal updates and expansion packs, the latest being February’s End of Dragons.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Knights of the Old Republic remake sounds like it may be running into some trouble, but fans of the original classic BioWare game have reason to celebrate. Celebrated collectibles maker Gentle Giant is prepping a new statue depicting one of the central characters of the original game. Jedi Knight Bastila Shan has never looked better.
The action-posed figure depicts Bastila Shan in battle with a Guardian Droid in the ruins of Dantooine, one of the early sites players visited in the game. The statue is made of PVC, and looks to feature some impressive sculpting and paint work. The yellow-hued double-bladed lightsaber in mid-swing is a particular highlight.

If it’s been a few years since you ventured into the classic Star Wars RPG, Bastila Shan was a Jedi Master many thousands of years before the events of the Skywalker Saga. Among other gifts provided by the Force, she had the rare capability known as battle meditation, which could be used to boost her allies and demoralize her enemies. At one point, she was tortured and turned to the dark side by Darth Malak, and the player is given a choice of how to interact with her – including options to redeem or kill her.
The new statue is steering toward launch in spring of 2023, but pre-orders open in just a few days, on 8/19 over at Gentle Giant’s official site. Suggested retail price is 80 republic credits, or $80 if you prefer your local currency.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blizzard announced that cross-progression is coming to Overwatch 2, and starting today, you can merge multiple accounts onto a single profile. 
With Overwatch 2 set to release on Oct. 4, which is also when the game will replace the original Overwatch, now’s a great time to get all your cosmetics, loot boxes, and more in order. It’s also a great time to merge some accounts so that you can, for example, jump between playing on PC and PlayStation freely. Fortunately, Blizzard made that possible today because you now merge multiple accounts. 
“With the launch of cross-progression, players can merge multiple Overwatch accounts to carry progression and in-game cosmetics into Overwatch 2 on a single profile,” a press release reads. “Starting Aug. 16, every player with a linked console account will be prompted at login to identify, select, and confirm the accounts you want to merge. Once you approve, we will prepare you accounts to be merged during the release of Overwatch 2.
“All players will need a battle.net account to play Overwatch 2, regardless of platform. Progress from linked console accounts will be stored on your battle.net accounts, which will share in-game cosmetics and progress across the linked accounts.”

Ebay is running a promotion today that knocks 15% off the price of brand-new items when you use the code BANK15 at the checkout, and you can use this to pick an RTX 3060 12GB for just £279. 
This is a great price for this mid-range GPU, and it's especially rare to see features like hardware-accelerated ray tracing and DLSS image reconstruction at this price point.

At the time, details about content and features were still a mystery. However, a short gameplay trailer released today revealed several collectible items and a Dragon Ball-themed map. You can watch the zany footage below.


According to Gamespot, two bundles touting skins inspired by popular characters will be available for purchase. The cosmetics include Goku, Vegeta, and Bulma with alternate styles, Beerus, and back bling items like Seer Fish, Power Pole, Kamesennin’s Shill, and two new Pickaxes. Nimbus and Space Pod gliders also appear with an anime-themed Kamehameha attack to decimate foes the Saiyan way. Finally, creative maps contain cool locations like Kami’s Palace, Goku’s House, the Room of Spirit and Time, and more. 
The description of the event reads as follows:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Razer Huntsman Mini Analog is one of a vanishingly small number of keyboards with analogue switches, meaning each key knows exactly how far down it's being pressed. That unlocks the door to some unique capabilities, from adjusting the sensitivity of the keyboard on the fly to using the WASD keys as a thumbstick replacement in racing games. It's also just a damn fine mechanical keyboard, with a comfortable 60% size, bright RGB lighting and premium PBT keycaps. 
You normally pay a lot for this kind of quality and functionality - £150, in fact - but today the keyboard has dropped to its lowest ever price of £97.94 over at Amazon UK.

More specifically, the showcase will begin at 1 p.m. PT/4 p.m. ET on Friday, Sept. 9, and will be hosted by Kinda Funny's Blessing Adeoye Jr. It is set to feature "incredible new content" from Disney & Pixar Games, Marvel Games, Lucasfilm Games, and 20th Century Games. This includes titles like Disney Dreamlight Valley, Marvel's Midnight Suns, Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga, and even a "sneak peek at the upcoming ensemble game from Skydance New Media."

You might recognize Skydance New Media as the studio where former Uncharted series director Amy Hennig works as president. Connecting those dots means the sneak peek at the upcoming ensemble game from Skydance New Media is the first sneak peek of Hennig's new game, which she revealed as a narrative-driven, action-adventure game last year. 
Considering it's an ensemble game, it could be any number of famous Marvel squads or families. However, it's probably a safe bet to assume it won't be the Avengers since Crystal Dynamic's Avengers is only two years old and still getting updates. We also know it won't be the Midnight Suns, as XCOM developer Firaxis is developing that. I'm hoping Hennig's game is based on the X-Men, but since it's an ensemble game, it could be something like the Inhumans, the Fantastic Four, or even the New Avengers, too. Only time will tell, but fortunately, we have less than a month of waiting to go because the Disney and Marvel Games Showcase airs on Sept. 9.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mindhack, an upcoming visual novel adventure, opens in a jail cell, as a criminal named Unid is brought before you by a pair of armed security guards. Your reputation precedes you: before the accused can even sit down, they call out your unusual ability to hack into the minds of people to ‘patch’ their flaws, turning their nefarious intentions into fields of flowers. But it’s ok, isn’t it? After all, the person in front of you has committed a crime and must be rehabilitated; reckless driving, hit and run, and arson.


So, you get to work. Talking to Unid allows you to build a rapport and understand their motivations. You learn about their past. They talk of their difficult childhood, pets, a lack of support - broken systems that left them behind and put them on their current path. It doesn’t matter. You have a job to do. And now, with that bit of knowledge, you’ve found the 'bug' in their programming. After initiating a hack on their brain, you eradicate this flaw, forcefully transforming their mind into a paradise of purity. Unid will never commit another crime again. Have you done the right thing?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Private Division, a publishing arm under the Take-Two Interactive umbrella, has signed a publishing agreement with Wētā Workshop to publish the studio’s new Lord of the Rings game. 
Wētā Workshop is the VFX studio behind The Lord of the Rings trilogy directed by Peter Jackson, and in 2014, it founded a video game division. That team is now developing a “new game set in the Middle-earth universe of J.R.R. Tolkien,” according to a press release. Middle-earth Enterprises has licensed the literary works of the series to Wētā Workshop, too, giving the studio “the broadest creative license to interpret the underlying lore of the books.” 
“We are thrilled to partner with Wētā Workshop to publish a game set in such an extraordinary and celebrated universe,” Private Division head Michael Worosz writes in a press release. “The Lord of the Rings IP is home to so many remarkable stories, and no entity is better equipped than the team at Wētā Workshop to create a distinctive, new Middle-earth gaming experience.” 
Wētā Workshop’s gaming lead, Amie Wolken, says it's a privilege to create a new game set in Middle-earth, especially one that’s going to be “so different from what fans have played previously.” 
“As a fan ourselves, we’re excited for gamers to explore Middle-earth in a way they never have before, and introduce new fans to the magic of The Lord of the Rings,” Wolken writes in the press release. 
This new Lord of the Rings game does not yet have a title and is early in development. It doesn’t have a release date either, but it’s expected to launch sometime during Take-Two’s Fiscal Year 2024 (April 2023 - March 2024). 
While waiting to learn more about this game, check out the latest gameplay from The Lord of the Rings: Gollum, which was recently delayed out of its Sept. 1 release date by a few months. Watch this teaser from the upcoming Amazon Middle-earth TV show, The Lord of the Rings:​ The Rings of Power, after that.

The movie seems to be early in development, although it did land Takashi Doscher as its writer earlier this year, but we might have some new information about it straight from a recent interview with Stehelski. 
More specifically, Stehelski revealed to Collider that the movie might feature an entirely Japanese cast and that the film could be in Japanese. Plus, he says Sony is on board with the idea. Here’s what he had to say:
This sounds awesome, but with the project being so early in development, anything could change. It’s great to hear that Sony’s on board with the idea, though!

Set to launch sometime today, Season 1 will feature a healthy dose of content for the free-to-play stage fighter, although exactly what remains unknown. However, we do know that Morty from Rick and Morty will join the roster next week on Aug. 23. Beyond that, the studio says that new modes and content will be added to the game throughout the duration of Season 1.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Instead of commanding a group of rugged, blood-soaked mercenaries on a turn-based death crawl through unimaginable horrors, how about a neo-Victorian circus troupe brawling with biomechatronic Londoners? That's Circus Electrique, a turn-based RPG that's much more lighthearted than its Darkest Dungeon counterpart (and seemingly main inspiration). But after playing a preview of the game’s first mission, there's more than meets the eye in this part steampunk RPG, part circus tycoon management sim.
You play as Amelia, a young, bold journalist returning to London to cover the grand re-opening of the Circus Electrique. A metaphorical spanner gets lobbed into the works, however, as the ceremony is interrupted with news that London’s citizens have started attacking each other (more than your average fisticuffs to get on the tube). Oddly, this doesn’t seem to have affected Amelia and your motley circus troupe, who venture out into London’s dangerous streets to find answers.

There's enormous boss monsters, several types of void, an incongruous cat creature, Death maybe... Where it differs is that there are also a few glimpses of the Island Sanctuary, FFXIV's new solo farming content. 

Watch it below ahead of the newly announced release date: August 23rd.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let’s rock, baby! Season 6 of Video Gameography gets stylish as we examine the Devil May Cry series! Over the next few weeks, we’ll be covering the history and lore of Capcom’s premiere action franchise, and this episode takes aim at the lauded yet somewhat polarizing Devil May Cry 4. 
Devil May Cry 4 took the series to a new generation of hardware, including Xbox for the first time. That's only one of the many firsts for this entry. Capcom moved Dante aside to place newcomer Nero in the starring role, who brought his demon arm Devil Bringer as the new centerpiece mechanic. Dante wasn't completely shunned, however; players control him during the adventure's questionably designed back half. In this episode, we'll discuss DMC 4's bizarre 2005 reveal, Capcom's reasoning behind Nero's conception, the fan reaction to the Xbox launch, and what it's really like to visit Fortuna's inspiration, Vatican City. 
Join hosts Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7) and the returning host of The Great Game Debate podcast Wes Bates (@GreatGameDeb8), as we unpack Nero's big debut.

Gathered after a tragedy befalls our group, I attempt to calm down and plea that we should trust one another. Blood’s been spilled, and tensions are at an all-time high for this lost party of teens trapped in a dangerous land. That’s not quite the scene I had imagined going into Digimon Survive, a tactical RPG by way of a visual novel based on the sometimes-kid-friendly monster franchise. The dramatic dynamics at play are gripping, but the grid-based battles left me snoozing, souring what could have been a compelling, complete package.

Asus, then, are about to increase the number of OLED gaming monitors on the market by 100%, with the ROG Swift PG48UQ and ROG Swift PG42UQ. And I’ve just had a brief, but generally impressive, play around with them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Of the many games announced during THQ Nordic's Showcase this evening, Space For Sale is the one that caught my eye the most, primarily because it looks a bit like Animal Crossing with aliens. In it, you play a small stubby astronaut who dreams of hitting it big as an intergalactic property developer. Man, they really took the phrase 'colony sim' to its literal extreme, didn't they? Are we sure that isn't Tom Nook under the helmet there? The proportions defintiely seem right, is all I'm saying. I just hope the rent you end up charging isn't... astronommical. Sorry. Here's the reveal trailer.

This time it's a reimagining of the original 1992 game, where you'll delve into Derceto Manor as returning characters Emily Hartwood and Edward Carnby in an attempt to figure out what's happened to Hartwood's missing uncle. As you'd expect, it does not go terribly well. But hey, it looks like it makes for a pretty good time.

But now they've got a new racing game in the works which eschews their previous naming convention for something that'll make you say with a wry smile and a shake of the head, "I see what you did there". It's called Wreckreation (you know, like 'recreation', not Wreck-reaction, or Wreck–eation) and its reveal trailer looks a bit like if Burnout and Hot Wheels went for a joyride together.

Well, Ghostrunner and Graven devs Slipgate Ironworks hope to provide an answer with their latest real-time tactics base-building game, Tempest Rising. Revealed earlier this evening during THQ Nordic's summer showcase, Tempest Rising is a retro-inspired strategy game where you'll take control of three factions fighting for a rare mineral.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Standing here, I realize that this Super Replay will be a cut above the rest because we’ll be slicing and dicing in Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance! Join us today on Twitch at 3 p.m. Central to enjoy two hours of what will be a full playthrough of the cult favorite action game streaming weekly each Friday. 
Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance serves as a sequel/spin-off to Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots that puts cyborg ninja Raiden at the helm. Instead of sneaking around in boxes, players eviscerate foes in fast-paced, stylish action courtesy of developer Platinum Games. Since its launch in 2013, Revengence’s action and absurdity have garnered it a passionate internet fandom, but I have a little secret: I didn’t think the game was all that special when I played it at launch. However, years of being inundated with internet memes and being told my opinion is incorrect has inspired me to give Revengece another look. Will I acquire a new appreciation for the game nine years later? How many watermelons will I slice? You’ll have to tune in to find out. 
Watch on Twitch!
Join me, Marcus Stewart, along with Andrew Reiner and Blake Hester, as we revisit Raiden’s beloved solo adventure. If you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes. You’ll also be granted entry to the official Game Informer Discord channel, where our welcoming community members, moderators, and staff gather to talk games, entertainment, food, and organize hangouts!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As many of you well know, I rather enjoyed cat adventure Stray recently. As an owner of two tortoiseshells myself, it was right up my alley. I do, however, have a confession to make. When I started seeing other real life cats enjoying the game alongside their respective humans, I began to feel sad and a bit left out. You see, my cats Maple and Midna (still!) haven't shown any interest in Stray whatsoever, not even flicking up their ears in response to the cat's in-game meow. I'm not gonna lie, it kinda broke my heart a little bit.
However, I'm beginning to think their (clear and apparent) hatred of video games goes further than simple disinterest. I was playing A Plague Tale for the first time last week, a game famous for its swarms of screeching rats, and STILL nothing. They love hunting rats and bringing them home to leave as little presents for us on our back door step. Heck, they'll even wig out and go into prowl mode when they hear them scrabbling away underneath our floorboards (yes, we do have a rat problem in our house). But clearly, their ice cold little murder hearts are unmoved by their video game equivalents. Is this what it's like when your children reject your hobbies and go and sulk in their rooms for the rest of the day? Because it sure does feel like it.

It does, however, still apply to Zapling Bygone. Describing it in less mechanical terms could make it sound creepy. You're a spore of an all-consuming hivemind, dropped on an unfamiliar planet to assimilate it. You move by skittering about on wobbly green tentacles, leaping and climbing and clinging and lashing out at living things with them, then absorbing the green muck that bursts out, and periodically consuming a creature powerful enough to be worth assimilating. And wearing its skull in the centre of your tentacle mass, because why not.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Infinity Ward has released a TikTok (it’s a new world) that shows some of its developers discussing a new map in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 called Farm 18, as reported by Eurogamer. 
The map will probably fall into the medium-sized range of Call of Duty maps, and that’s because it’s one part a level set in an abandoned and overgrown cement factory and another part, Shoothouse, the popular level from 2019’s Call of Duty: Modern Warfare. Of course, it’s not a 1-to-1 recreation, but Infinity Ward says Farm 18’s center, which is a large shoot house, was inspired by Modern Warfare’s Shoothouse.
Check it out for yourself below:

August 11, 2022
As you can see, the map looks like it’s going to be a great time. Players looking to play it safe can stick to the outside, using the overgrown brush to conceal them while stalking the level’s perimeter. Those looking for a riskier fight can head into the central warehouse, where they’ll find themselves in the Shoothouse-inspired part of Farm 18.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Free your mind for yet another ScummVM release!
Nine newly supported games on 6 engines will plunge you into a variety of different settings. Are you able to escape from an alien-infested planet? What about challenging the Lord of the Dead in the Underworld? And have you ever explored the deepest depth of your psyche to see if you really know yourself?
Find out in one of the following titles:
Sanitarium
Hades Challenge
Marvel Comics Spider-Man: The Sinister Six
The 11th Hour
Clandestiny
Tender Loving Care (CD-ROM Editions)
Uncle Henry's Playhouse
Wetlands
Chewy: Esc from F5
Besides adding new games, we are always focused on improving already supported games. Once again, we managed to squash quite a few bugs from various engines. It is always impressive to see bugs getting fixed in engines that are more than 20 years old!
One of the main new features of ScummVM 2.6.0 is a completely new way to view your games in an amazing icon grid overview via our launcher. Accompanied by some very shiny artwork provided by our graphics artists, you are now able to show off your collection like never before. It almost looks and feels like a virtual shelf!
Check out the full Release Notes for a comprehensive summary of how our developers managed to make ScummVM even more amazing!
You can find all of this goodness available for a number of platforms on our downloads page. If you are using Windows, macOS or the Ubuntu Snap package, the autoupdater will assist you in updating to ScummVM 2.6.0.
As always, thank you for your continuous support — happy adventuring!
