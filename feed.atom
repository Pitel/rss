        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Michael B. Jordan will star
Video game adaptations are everywhere these days -- why not throw another one on the pile? We now know there's a Rainbow Six movie coming from Paramount, and it's just been announced that John Wick director Chad Stahelski is attached to the project, as covered by The Hollywood Reporter in an exclusive. Actor Michael B. Jordan is also involved, and he'll star as John Clark -- the protagonist of Tom Clancy's famous book series that inspired the games. Jordan's already taken on the role of Clark after starring in the 2021 film Without Remorse which was also based on Clancy's work.
This new movie will likely serve as a sequel to Without Remorse, as at the end of the film, Clark is planning to establish the famed multinational anti-terrorist "Rainbow" team. While the first film only took inspiration from Clancy's writing, this potential sequel will instead focus on the team that was made so popular by Ubisoft's game series: Rainbow Six. Details are sparse as of now, as the movie does not yet have a release date or plot summary, so keep in mind that it's all pretty much speculation. Even so, it's hard to imagine they'd pass on drawing inspiration from the games at least a little bit, especially for an action movie.
[caption id="attachment_358479" align="alignnone" width="1200"] Image via Paramount Pictures[/caption]
Chad Stahelski is best known for his directorial debut with the John Wick movies, but he's actually been around the industry for a long time as a stuntman, having worked on films like The Matrix, Van Helsing, and Escape from L.A. Here's hoping that such a prolific figure in the action space will make unique, compelling work of the IP he's drawing on because a lot of fans are hoping to see their favorite series done justice on the silver screen.

Gunfire Games' Remnant: From the Ashes is making its way to a new platform on the Nintendo Switch. The co-op horror action game is coming to Nintendo's handheld sometime soon.
The survival horror-inspired co-op shooter first arrived in 2019, pitting solo players or teams against a horde of monstrosities in a decrepit urban landscape. Now, Gunfire Games is bringing the action to a handheld format, alongside THQ Nordic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fuLxV3g6YU
No release date has been set yet. A sequel to Remnant, currently dubbed Remnant 2, was revealed at The Game Awards 2022. The new Remnant title is targeting a 2023 launch, and will be headed to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC, but no Switch.
Rise from the ashes
It's a bit of a surprise, but certainly not an unwelcome one. Remnant: From the Ashes has always been talked up by those I know who have played it, and another platform for the co-op action game certainly seems like a good thing.
In our review from the game's launch, it does assert that while Remnant does take a while to get it going, it does eventually let it rip. The randomization offers a bit of variety to each run, and the urban-apocalyptic world is something special altogether, like a mix between Metro and Eldritch horror.
Maybe the game will find another audience to build up on the Switch, just in time to tee them up for the sequel. We'll keep an eye out for more to come on Remnant: From the Ashes' Switch port, and how soon it will be arriving.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Live Service Squad
It looks like Warner Bros. and Rocksteady's Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League may have some live service features tied into it. A new leak, with details corroborated by VGC, shows mentions of live service features that include a battle pass.
The leaked image circulated out from 4chan and Reddit and was soon picked up by news outlet VGC. According to a source VGC spoke to, the image comes from a recent test build and shows menus planned for Rocksteady's next game. Among these elements are a battle pass, store, and currencies, which would imply some live service features could be in the game.
VGC reports that a development source has said a battle pass is planned, but it would be focused on cosmetic content. The currencies shown also reportedly pertain to XP and skill trees for characters. These characters won't start off weak, according to VGC's source, but will "start off great and can get ridiculous, like Arkham Knight's Batman."

A suicide mission
We haven't seen much Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League gameplay yet that could further back this up or not. Most recently, we saw a cinematic tease of the upcoming anti-hero brawler at The Game Awards 2022. Alongside a release date confirmation for May 26, 2023, Rocksteady also confirmed that Kevin Conroy would be the voice of Batman as well. The voice actor, who played Batman in both the Arkham games series and many animated adaptations, including Batman: The Animated Series, died last year.
This is Rocksteady's first game since 2015's Arkham Knight, so fans are likely curious about how these systems pan out. If these shots are from an internal test version, things could potentially shift. Hopefully we'll learn more about what's in store for Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League sometime between now and its May release date.

Regardless of what kind of performance you're aiming for, you'll need a pretty beefy machine, with 24GB of RAM and an RTX 3070 required to hit those recommended specs.

Video games are a pretty darn profitable industry. As it turns out, a lot of people are willing to pay a lot of money to press little buttons. But only a select few button-pressing facilitators can claim to have made the most money. And only an even more select few can claim to actually be good.
High sales don't always translate into high quality. That's not a secret — there's a reason the fine folks at the British Film Institute don't factor box office take into the Sight & Sound poll (I like Avengers: Endgame, but it's not standing side-by-side with 2001: A Space Odyssey). Still, the Top 10 best-selling games in history have turned a lot of copies, and there's got to be some reason they connect with so many players.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's the little details that make the difference
The Sims 4's ongoing support from both its fans and developers speaks to the behemoth of the simulation genre that it is. Just when we thought the game offered anything players could possibly dream of, they turn around and offer even more possibilities -- which is exactly what Maxis is doing with the release of two mini-DLCs, also known as kits. The Simtimates Collection Kit and the Bathroom Clutter Kit are releasing on January 19 for PC and Mac, as well as Xbox and PlayStation consoles.
The former includes upgrades to the usual set of pajamas that Sims wear, and the collection "will help any Sim look bold, flirty, & charming in the bedroom with lacey bodysuits, a variety of underwear styles & playful boxer prints." Now your Sim can lounge around in style, and of course, the new looks can invite some more spice into your game if you're into that kind of thing.
https://twitter.com/TheSims/status/1615380171607126016
The Bathroom Clutter Kit takes a turn into the messy -- this kit allows players to customize their clutter, and scatter various knick-knacks around their bathrooms. The items range from Grandma's dentures to makeup palettes, so you'll be able to create a lived-in space for anybody in your Sims household.
Both of these kits were teased in the "It's All Relative" Roadmap for The Sims 4 posted on January 12, 2023, which also announced that the game will receive "one big update" and an expansion pack on top of the two new kits. In addition, there will also be more support for extended family systems in the game, which will also tie back into the big expansion that's coming this year, according to the Roadmap post. Looks like this is only the beginning of the exciting things the Maxis team has in store, and considering The Sims 4 is now free-to-play, it's an excellent time to jump in and join the fun.

Comedy has evolved a lot over the centuries and millennia, but one particular comedic mainstay has passed the test of time over and over again: Slapstick. It turns out that civilisation, no matter how advanced, will always appreciate a good pratfall, or even something as simple as a human being moving in a way that human beings aren't supposed to. We're all just complicated upright monkeys, at the end of the day.
And so, in honour of the humble-yet-hilarious form of comedy that is slapstick, we've assembled the very finest physical comedy games that the Nintendo Switch has to offer. "Wacky Physics" is its own genre of games, usually to do with either intentionally frustrating controls, ragdoll characters that feel like piloting a mech made of jelly, or physics simulation dials turned up to 11.

Forever Entertainment has announced that MegaPixel Studios shooter The House of the Dead: Remake will bring its decaying destruction to PS5 on January 20, following on from its previous releases on PS4, Xbox, PC, and Nintendo Switch platforms.
First launched in the spring of 2022, The House of the Dead: Remake is a fully overhauled revisit to Sega's widely popular 1997 arcade release, and follows special agents Rogan and G as they once again infiltrate the mysterious Gothic mansion of god-complex motherfucker Dr. Curien. What follows is a particularly splashy battle with a wide variety of disgusting zombies, weird mutants, vampire bats, chainsaw-wielding hillbillies, and bizarre, wall-running gremlins. Just remember to aim for the head.

MegaPixel's remake of the iconic, gory rail-shooter captures all of the grim, fast-paced action and multi-pathed, breathless gameplay of the original release, while also offering fully redesigned visuals, new monsters, an arsenal of additional weaponry, multiple endings, gallery and photo modes, and a brand new "Horde" style multiplayer variant. The PS5 version of HotD: Remake also features some additional visual polish from its previously released PS4 brethren.
The House of the Dead: Remake launches digitally on PS5 January 20. It is available right now on PS4, Xbox, PC (via Steam and GoG), and Nintendo Switch.

As someone who is both a fan of speedrunning and raising money for a good cause, Games Done Quick runs some of my favorite gaming events of the year. The organization's first event of the year, Awesome Games Done Quick, came to a close this weekend, but not after securing some big wins first. During the event's run on Twitch from January 8-15, they raised over $2.6 million for Prevent Cancer Foundation, and some of the participants broke some new speedrunning world records:
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge: Co-op Any% Arcade Old Patch by Benja and Paul-Knives (56:18)
Super Mario Galaxy 2: Any% with Bank Run by Jhay (2:54:51.33)
PowerWash Simulator: 6 Players, All Vehicles, No Soap by Amyrlinn, Bullets, Biglaw, Enigma Requiem, AngelicKnight, and Acadiel (33:31.7)
Steven Seagal Is: The Final Option (Prototype): any% 9 exits by Crak Atak (21:44.6)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTpXQ9hSq_w
This year's Awesome Games Done Quick supported the Prevent Cancer Foundation, which is "the only U.S.-based nonprofit organization solely dedicated to cancer prevention and early detection." GDQ has raised more than $43 million in its lifetime for various charities, including Doctors Without Borders, Direct Relief, AbleGamers, Malala Fund, and Organization for Autism Research. It's always great to see them in the news, because Games Done Quick has to be one of the most wholesome and uplifting organizations in gaming.
If you missed the live event this time around, don't worry! There's an archive of the entire AGDQ 2023 — as well as other past events — on the Games Done Quick YouTube channel.
Games Done Quick also announced the dates for some more of their upcoming events this year, including the all-female winter speedrunning event Frost Fatales (February 26-March 4, 2023) and Summer Games Done Quick (May 28-June 4, 2023).

Wonderful news for those players still decking it out in the dazzling, air-dashing world of Guilty Gear Xrd — Developer Arc System Works has announced that the long-awaited rollback netcode update is now ready to rock, and will be patched into the PC (Steam) edition of Guilty Gear Xrd: Rev 2 on January 20.
The new update will apply the much-vaunted rollback netcode technology to the anime fighter, in hopes of bringing the silkiest, smoothiest connections for global online play. Arc System Works previously tested the new update in a beta held in October 2022, with the update clearly ready to rock. For those players who decided to stick with GGXRD — rather than move on to 2021 release Guilty Gear Strive — this will allow you to enjoy the fantastic, top-tier scrapper with a wider community of players.
As an added bonus, players who are playing GG Strive might not have to listen to so many Xrd-heads telling them to stop enjoying themselves. Everyone's a winner, essentially.
Guilty Gear Xrd: Rev 2 is available now on PS4, PC, and Xbox One. Guilty Gear Strive is also available on PlayStation and PC platforms, with an Xbox port currently scheduled to launch this spring.

[Update: Behavior Interactive has confirmed to Destructoid that Leatherface is not being removed from Dead by Daylight, and will remain part of the posse of killers stalking their way through The Fog.
A new rumor hit the community of Behavior Interactive's Dead by Daylight this weekend, suggesting that one of its popular Hunters — Leatherface of The Texas Chain Saw Massacre fame — might be preparing to take on his final slaughterthons in the assymetrical slasher.
According to a moderator from the sneaky-leaky DbDLeaks Discord, the license for Leatherface is about to reach its conclusion, with no suggestion that the developer, or publisher, are prepared to renew the contract for yer boy Bubba. The rumor, though not confirmed, seems snug, as Leatherface will soon be making his hammer blows felt in his very own assymetrical title, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, which is currently in development at Sumo Digital.
https://twitter.com/LeaksDbd/status/1611429823116677124?s=20&t=PG83dYm-Y8TmQYqsRvoTGg
Scheduled to launch later in 2023, and published by Gun Interactive, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre will see players on the run from the terrifying Sawyer family, consisting of The Hitchhiker, The Cook, and, of course, Leatherface himself. As such, one would assume that this title would have the exclusive rights to the saggy-pants psychopath, and would rather he wasn't making an appearance in other games, especially one so immediately similar to its own.
Behavior Interactive is yet to comment on the rumor, but we'll be sure to update this story once we know the official score. For now, it seems, Dead by Daylight Leatherface mains should probably get their "fill" of Survivors, before their favorite run 'n' revver goes jogging through the woods for pastures new.
Dead by Daylight is available now on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and mobile platforms.

France's Solidaires Informatique union has called for strike action at developer/publisher Ubisoft's Paris office. The industrial action, scheduled to take place next week on Friday, January 27, is being held in response to comments made by Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot over the company's recent financial losses.
The news comes one week after Ubisoft announced that it was further delaying pirate adventure Skull & Bones, alongside comments that implied the company was financially struggling after a particularly tough year for its game sales. Guillemot noted that he was hoping to cut costs at the studio, reducing expenditure by some €200 million through "targeted restructuring, divesting some non-core assets, and usual natural attrition."

The Recommended requirements call for an AMD Ryzen 5 3600 or Intel Core i7-8700K, operating at 3.7 GHz or better, for the CPU. On the video card side, an AMD Radeon RX 6700 XT 12 GB or NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 8 GB are the benchmarks to clear.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["Remember you will die".
Though Persona 3 was actually the fourth mainline release in the series, the meme goes that it was really the first because Atlus just refuses to acknowledge the previous games. As a fresh start for the series, Persona 3 was eventually followed up with not one, but two ‘final’ versions that each had important new features which didn’t appear in the other version. The version that was chosen for the modern remaster was Persona 3 Portable, which originally saw release on the PSP in the late 2000s. Though it certainly feels like an aging portable game, P3P shows that it’s still got it where it counts; despite some drawbacks, this remains an enjoyable and engaging RPG.
Much like other releases in the series, P3P follows an ensemble cast of high school characters led by your silent protagonist, who in this case is a transfer student who returns to their hometown ten years after the death of both their parents. Things quickly take a darker turn when you experience the mysterious Dark Hour, a hidden, liminal time just after midnight when a creepy moon shines brightly and all humans briefly turn into standing coffins.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As someone whose only experience with the Persona series lay with Persona 5, I dove into Persona 3 Portable's PC re-release with one expectation: it will be old and therefore quite bad. Looking back, was I naïve? Yes. And was I wrong? I'm delighted to report that I was catastrophically wrong.
From what I've played so far of Persona 3, I reckon it's well worth a whirl if you're a newcomer, or a Persona 5 fan who's concerned that a game from 2009 won't be all that good. Not only does it stand on its own as a fun high school mystery with an alarmingly dark undertone, it almost acts as a fun history lesson too.

In late 2022, the Blizzard community received the shocking news that titles such as Overwatch 2, Hearthstone, and World of Warcraft were to be shuttered in China, following the collapse of a partnership deal between Activision Blizzard and NetEase — New comments from the WoW publisher points to NetEase itself for being the cause of the industry-shaking decision.
In a post by Blizzard China, (reported by global news outlet Reuters), the publisher claims that it proposed a six-month extension of its partnership, giving Blizzard a further six months to support its games in China while looking for a new publisher, but this proposal was rejected by NetEase. Reuters also claims that NetEase has already begun the process of disbanding the teams responsible for the marketing and support of Blizzard's titles.
There is a definitive element of "He said, She said" at play regarding the initial split, as both parties have commented that it was irreconcilable differences with the other that caused the 14-year publishing deal to not receive an extension. Various sources have cited money, data handling, and IP proposals as lynchpins for the failed contract negotiations, with NetEase president Simon Zhu going so far as to refer to an unnamed Activision Blizzard executive as a "jerk".
As such, eight Activision Blizzard titles will be shuttered in China as of January 23. The affected titles are World of Warcraft, Warcraft III: Reforged, Hearthstone, Diablo III, Diablo: Immortal, StarCraft, Overwatch 2, and Heroes of the Storm. Of course, this motion will also severely impact China's lucrative esports scene, as well as its litany of professional players.
Activision Blizzard has noted that it is currently seeking a new publishing partner in China. It is assumed that, once a partner is found and a deal finalized, that normal service will return to these eight games.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["Heartbreak, heartbreak, you tell me goomba".
Although Shin Megami Tensei is technically the flagship RPG franchise over at Atlus, its spin-off Persona series has made huge strides in finding mainstream appeal in recent years. While Persona 5 may have done most of the heavy lifting, Persona 4 Golden (P4G)—the enhanced re-release of the PS2 classic—was also an instrumental part in getting the series on the map. Part of the benefit of being released on the tragically doomed PS Vita meant that it was that much easier to stand out from the slim crowd of games on the platform, and P4G was quickly lauded as one of the few must-have buys for the platform. After stronger-than-expected sales from its surprise Steam release in 2020, P4G has now found its way to the Switch and we’re pleased to report that it is still a thoroughly delightful RPG.
P4G places you in the role of a city-dwelling silent protagonist who moves to the rural town of Inaba to live with his uncle and cousin for a year while his parents work abroad. While your character seems to adjust well to his new life, things are tense around town as there’s a serial killer on the loose who’s consistently evading the police. Your character and his newfound friends then quickly get wrapped up in the mystery when they discover the Midnight Channel, a mysterious 'other world' that can be accessed by crawling through a TV screen. The killer is using the Midnight Channel and its abundant population of Shadows to murder his victims, but you soon realize that you can battle Shadows using your Personas and free the victims before it's too late. You and your friends thus set out to save the killer’s victims while also stringing together clues to try and deduce who the killer is.

I can't even imagine how long it would take you to do a full journey across it all, but it will definitely take you longer than the two hours you'll spend in the company of Brainwash Gang's loosely connected anthology story game The Longest Road On Earth.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Persona 3 released in North America in 2007 on PlayStation 2 and was a mild hit. The dark, teen drama RPG had a niche audience, but those who found the game adored it. The game received a special edition release with added in content in 2008 with FES, and was then re-released a third time for PSP in 2010 with the most added content, but some modifications made to run on Sony's handheld platform.
Persona 4 followed – again a mild hit – but then Persona 5 came along and cemented the franchise's reputation as one of the best RPGs ever made. Fans who discovered the series with 5 have wanted to figure out what they've been missing out on, and longtime players have been demanding the re-release of 3 so that a larger audience could play what many call their favorite. After arguably too long, Atlus is finally ready to make that happen with the re-re-re-release of Persona 3 on modern consoles January 19.
Join Kyle Hilliard and Wesley LeBlanc as they look at the game's first true dungeon and chat about perhaps the most controversial Persona game in the series.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Heads up, Stadia owners: Google’s cloud gaming program is shutting down tomorrow, January 18. The service began issuing refunds for all hardware last November, but if you haven’t received one yet, information on how to obtain one should have been emailed to the Google account used to make the purchase. However, past Stadia Pro subscriptions will not receive refunds.
There's a silver lining for those of you with Stadia controllers and nothing to use them for. Starting today, you can download an update that will allow your controller to use Bluetooth. However, be warned: this permanently disables wi-fi capabilities, so if you download the update now, you won't be able to play Stadia games before the shutdown tomorrow. For more details, you can visit the Stadia Help Center.
Stadians, you can now update your Stadia Controller’s firmware to enable Bluetooth Low Energy connections.

January 17, 2023
If you missed the news about the shutdown, last September, Stadia’s VP and General Manager said in a blog post that “while Stadia's approach to streaming games for consumers was built on a strong technology foundation, it hasn't gained the traction with users that we expected so we’ve made the difficult decision to begin winding down our Stadia streaming service.” 
Stadia’s struggles were no secret. Its first-party studios were shut down just over a year in, with the service being “deprioritized” a year later. While it was an interesting experiment, some experiments are just destined to fail. Rest in peace, Stadia.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Update 1.2.0 to the rescue
Just this past week, Platinum released the first major post-launch update for Bayonetta 3, and it was a doozy. Not only did it address some long-running concerns from the community for a few encounters (and Viola's moveset), but it also directly impacted a really low key aspect of the game: the playable teaser for the upcoming release Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon.
Here's a quick reminder of what that update actually changed:
Game Modes
Conditions for obtaining the “Tricolored Keys” needed to unseal the “Old Picture Book” have been made easier.
“Tricolored Keys” will be automatically available on the chapter select screen once it becomes possible to access the “Gates of Hell”.
Even if the player already has access to the Gates of Hell, or has already obtained one or two keys, they will automatically obtain the remaining keys when going to the chapter select screen after applying the update.
Accessing the Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon demo is much easier in 2023
As the Nintendo of Europe Twitter account pointed out this weekend, once you have the new update (1.2.0) installed, you can just buy the Old Picture Book from the Gates of Hell shop: no keys or added steps needed! Prior to the update, after buying the book, you needed to locate three hidden keys spread across several chapters of the game (Chapter 1, 4, and 13).
This takes me back to the bygone era where demos were king, and sometimes were selling points all on their own. While the Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon itself is very brief, it's cool to see more free unlockables in games, sans DLC. The action genre is the perfect host for it.

Konami could be gearing up "no pun intended" to make a new announcement concerning the Metal Gear franchise — At least that's what was allegedly inferred in a recent tweet from Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance voice actor Quinton Flynn.
Flynn, who voices the divisive (I personally like the kid) protagonist Raiden, made the cryptic comment in response to a fan on his Twitter. Following a post in which Flynn advertised a new Cameo page, follower zxSOLIDxSNAKEzx casually commented "Perhaps a Metal Gear Rising 2 along with the rest of the upcoming Metal Gear showcase might just make it?"
"Stayed tuned for things to be announced in the coming weeks" responded Flynn, complete with winky face.
https://twitter.com/quintonflynn/status/1615284297056788481?s=20&t=SXPPaeCmdFKNJ6STVk13Bw
Now, of course, it should be made clear that Flynn might simply be referring to a personal project that he has in mind, rather than a brand new game, remaster, or remake. But with the 10th anniversary of Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance approaching, as well as ongoing rumors that something "Metal Gear Remake"-related might be in the works at Konami, it's all the faithful fan community needs to hear to get their hype engines up and running.
Rising: Revengeance launched on PS3 and Xbox 360 in February 2013, and sees MGS 2 hero Raiden indulging in a spot of incredibly violent hack 'n' slash action. Developed by PlatinumGames, the spin-off adventure features all of the highly adrenalized and chaotic combat one would expect from the studio, and is frequently cited as one of the unsung classics of Hideo Kojima's defining franchise.
Is a remake reveal incoming? Or have we all gotten the wrong end of the sword? Time will tell.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We had a discussion in our Monday meeting that got louder than things normally do, because The Last Of Us TV show came up, and we found ourselves divided into two camps. Well, three. Camp one was excited for the TV show and camp two posited that there's no point making an adaptation of something if your adaptation is just the same thing. (The third camp was "eh, I might check it out" and watched the other two camps duking it out). I was in camp two. If you're adapting something, adapt! Make changes! Otherwise I might as well just consume the original thing again! The Last Of Us has already been released, what, three times?
This was made funnier by the fact that nobody on staff had seen the TV show, so we were just arguing about tweets we'd seen that describe the show, the worst way to conduct a discussion outside of e.g. scrawling insults on the side of Teslas and self-driving them into each other's front doors. But it got me to thinking about adaptations, because there have been loads of adaptations of things that aren't games into video games. What goes wrong in the other direction?

Since 2019, YouTuber "Mojo Swoptops" has rebuilt a wide and weird range of Edinburgh sights inside Far Cry 5's level editor, from the big tourist landmarks like the castle and Forth Bridge to perfectly mundane places such as blocks of flats and nightclubs at chucking-out time. As an Edinburgh resident, it's great fun to see, and a very pleasing contrast to the gleaming miniature reimagination seen in Forza Horizon 4.

It was crazy to see the moment when Fire Emblem really started to make it big out of Japan. I've said it often, but growing up with people who constantly questioned where Marth and Roy were from in Smash Bros., witnessing the star power of this series (to the point where it has multiple spinoffs) from every angle has been something else. And now that it's more in the public eye, it's also subject to quite a bit of scrutiny.
I don't think people will object to much in Fire Emblem Engage, though.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[School's out.
It's been almost four years since the hugely successful Fire Emblem: Three Houses stormed onto Switch and reignited our passion for Intelligent Systems' long-running tactical RPG franchise. Here was a game that deepened the relationship and social sim aspects and captured the hearts of gamers who revelled in three separate campaign paths packed full of interactive melodrama that sat perfectly alongside the series' signature strategic action.
Fast forward to 2023 and you'd be forgiven for expecting Fire Emblem Engage to follow closely in the footsteps of its all-conquering predecessor whilst refining combat, smoothing rough edges, and adding even more relationships, more romance, and just generally more of all the aspects that so many people readily connected with last time around. Well, excuse you for being wrong, because this latest Fire Emblem escapade is side-stepping all of that in favour of a different flavour of adventure that harks backs to earlier entries in the franchise. Its focus is set firmly on combat, with everything else taking a firm backseat.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Last of Us, the highly anticipated TV adaptation of Naughty Dog's hit game of the same name, finally premiered Sunday and it's looking like a massive hit for HBO. 
That's because The Last of Us' premiere was the second largest debut for an HBO series since 2010, beaten only by last year's House of the Dragon, the first TV spinoff from HBO's Game of Thrones series. The Last of Us drew in 4.7 million views, according to a Deadline report, coming in second to House of the Dragon's 2022 premiere which pulled in 9.986 million watchers. The Last of Us is matched by HBO's Boardwalk Empire, which premiered in 2010 to 4.81 million viewers. 
Deadline writes that HBO says Sunday night viewing usually represents 20 to 40% of a given show's gross audience per episode (HBO shows typically release episodes on Sunday nights). 
"We are thrilled to see fans of the series and game alike experience this iconic story in a new way, and we extend our gratitude to them for helping to make it a success," CEO and chairman of HBO and HBO Max Content Casey Bloys said, according to Deadline. "Congratulations to [showrunners Craig Mazin and Neil Druckmann, who is also a co-creator of The Last of Us], and the brilliant cast and crew who worked tirelessly to bring this show to life. We look forward to fans around the world enjoying the rest of the season." 
"Our focus was simply to make the best possible adaption of this beloved story for as big an audience as we could," Druckmann and Mazin said, according to Deadline. "We are overjoyed to see how many fans, both old and new, have welcomed The Last of Us into their homes and their hearts." 
While waiting for this week's episode, read our interview with Druckmann and Joel actor Pedro Pascal about how The Last of Us was changed for TV, and then read about how there are no plans for The Last of Us show to go beyond the games.

The publisher shared the patch notes for version 1.0.3 today on its Japanese website, and there's a pretty notable change coming to the game. Deep in Abyss mode — the game's second mode where you create your own character and play through a brand new story — is now available from the start! That means you no longer have to complete Hello Abyss mode in order to access it. And we much preferred Deep in Abyss mode to the game's story mode, Hello Abyss.

Pets can do silly things. They eat newspapers, tear up fabric, and make us laugh. But one famous fish has accidentally revealed its owner's credit card details during a Pokémon Violet livestream. Automaton Media reports that the fish found its way onto the eShop and did a number of things, including changing the user nickname and adding funds to the owner's wallet.
Okay, this one needs some context, doesn't it? Mutekimaru Channel is a Japanese YouTuber whose most well-known livestream series is called 'Fish Play Pokémon'. On these streams — you guessed it — some pet fish actually manages to play through entire Pokémon games. The channel has played through Pokémon Crystal, LeafGreen, and Sapphire, among many others — with 20,00 hours of playtime under their belt, this school of fish is incredibly impressive.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Further hurdles for $68 billion dollar deal
New roadblocks will reportedly be placed in the path of Microsoft in its bid to purchase publisher Activision Blizzard — According to a report by Reuters, the European Commission (EU) is preparing to state its objection to the deal in the coming weeks, adding further strife to Microsoft's acquisition plans.
As those who have been following our reporting will know, Microsoft requires the favor of several global regulatory bodies in order to complete the purchase, and is already mired in a lawsuit with the United States Federal Trade Commission (FTC) which itself is against the sale taking place. While Microsoft will be able to make suggestions to placate the bodies, the whole process has already turned bitter at points, helping matters none.
The commission declined to respond to Reuters report, though a Microsoft representative said of the story: "We're continuing to work with the European Commission to address any marketplace concerns. Our goal is to bring more games to more people, and this deal will further that goal."
The comment pursues Microsoft's line that it is not seeking to form a monopoly with the purchase of Activision Blizzard, a dogged mantra that it is following in the face of concerns that billion-dollar franchises such as Call of Duty may become Xbox exclusives at some point in the future. Microsoft's attempts to assuage these concerns have been relatively futile as of late.
The Microsoft/FTC lawsuit is scheduled to go to trial this summer, with both parties free to appeal whatever the outcome. Microsoft will then have to placate the EU Commission and other bodies in similar fashion, which makes the Activision Blizzard purchase — a deal that I cannot see MS backing away from — a long, long time in the making.

Have you ever wondered what the villagers of Animal Crossing taste like? Nah, can't say that we have, either. But, thanks to a collaboration between Nintendo and luxury chocolate brand Godiva, residents in Japan can now purhase boxes of chocolates featuring the adorable mugs of Tom Nook, Isabelle, Timmy and Tommy, and more. Yummy.
The sets are available for a limited time and appear to be on sale in preparation for Valentine's Day on February 14th. Indeed, though they've been live since January 6th, sales will cease on February 15th, so the timing certainly seems relevant. What you're getting for your hard earned yen (or whatever your local currency is, should you choose to import), however, is quite tasty - literally!

We have seen a lot of Nintendo-themed builds in Halo Infinite's Forge Mode over the past few months including Ocarina of Time's Kokiri Forest and Super Mario 64's Peach's Castle. One thing has been missing from each of these however: a giant cannon that fires you onto the slopes of an active volcano.
Fortunately, two fans have managed to fix this very real problem as they took to the shooter's creative game mode to build the renowned Mario Kart circuit, DK Mountain (thanks, Go Nintendo). @Its_L010 took to Twitter to share a video of their work with collaborator @Ludo_HT and we must say, the results are really impressive.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've played around four hours of soviet-punk FPS Atomic Heart, which took me from the story's opening moments to plenty of the game's earliest bits. The final hour or so was split into two parts, thanks to a lovely dev who time-skipped me forwards and into the game's open world, before warping me through a gate and into an early boss's lair. There was a lot to take in, from robo-gloves, to sex-dom vending machines, to grannies with bazookas.
I went in with expectations that it might be a little like BioShock, all steely and serious in its delivery of some vaguely philosophical truth. But I emerged with a totally different impression. Far from polished seriousness, Atomic Heart seems a little disjointed in its ambition, with a main character who almost immediately kills any atmosphere when he opens his mouth.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My dog is undeniably a good boy, but he's never saved my life in a videogame. He could learn a trick or two from MissMikaa's dog, who apparently knows when to step in and move her Elden Ring character away from a fiery death. 
MissMikaa is the streamer who last week simultaneously beat Elden Ring with a controller and a dance mat, which should give you some clue as to how he rendered canine assistance.

This is a problem the upcoming Lies of P hopes to fix, as revealed in a new gameplay trailer designed to show off how nice it looks on a Radeon RX 7900 XTX. I will likely never own a Radeon RX 7900 XTX, but it's looking increasingly likely that I will buy Lies of P. 
It's a Soulslike that plonks you into an alternate Victorian London where people got real good at inventing creepy automata. You play as the big P himself, Pinocchio.

Golf Story was one of the biggest surprises in the Switch’s extremely strong first year on the market. Thanks to Golf Story’s charming, nostalgic presentation and novel sports/RPG fusion, Sports Story has long been one of my most anticipated sequels. Unfortunately, its unfocused nature and frustrating gameplay are only overshadowed by a pervasive lack of polish that prevents Sports Story from being worth your time. 
As the name suggests, Sports Story expands the world to include other games while creating a more sweeping and ambitious story. As sports go…]]></summary>

Huh. I suppose I can stop agonising over whether he has a place in my latest Patriot deck.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Awesome Games Done Quick (AGDQ) started the New Year with a bang, raising over $2.6 million for the Prevent Cancer Foundation. For the unfamiliar, GDQ is a 24-hour charity live-stream where dedicated gamers show off speedruns of their favorite games. Before 2020, most events were held in person, but since then they've mostly been broadcasted from streamers' homes. This year's event ran from January 8-15 and included over 140 runs.
🏁TIME🏁
#AGDQ2023 has raised a total amount of $2,642,493 for @preventcancer!
#SGDQ2023 from May 28th to June 4th ⏱️ #ThankYouMike 👏 pic.twitter.com/h3lkCmg0J7
January 15, 2023
While most runners don't expect to set new records during the marathon, a whopping four were set this year for the following games: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge, PowerWash Simulator, Super Mario Galaxy 2, and Steven Seagal Is: The Final Option (Prototype). Most years have one or two records set, but four is a big deal.
2023 marks the 14th year that the biannual charity marathon has taken place. They have two main events in the winter and summer, but they also hold smaller events throughout the year. One of these is Frost Fatales, an all-women speedrunning event, which will take place from February 26 - March 4, 2023 on Twitch. Since it was founded in 2010, the organization has raised over $43 million for charity.
AGDQ was initially set to be in person but was moved online due to COVID concerns. Their summer event, Summer Games Done Quick, will be held from May 28 - June 4, though it's unclear whether the event will also take place in person.

Due out later this year, you play a deaf hero in search of a cure to a sinister 'howling plague' that's devastated the land around you and turned all its inhabitants into blood-thirsty beasts - and having played its first chapter last week, its combination of tight planning, grid-based shoving and limited ammo a la Into The Breach is very, very moreish indeed. Definitely one to watch for strategy game fans.

In Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers, not only can the titular protagonist suffer a variety of gruesome fates if you so much as put a foot wrong, but there's a point where you can soft-lock the entire game by failing to pick up an easily missable single snake scale from a busy crime scene — and you won't even know you did anything wrong for several in-game days. I'm not 100% sure this wasn't an oversight on the part of the developers, but at the same time, that's exactly the sort of shit that Sierra liked to pull.

Cult of the Lamb's adorable cult leader has become iconic in their red fleece, but their wardrobe grows over time. By finishing quests for peripheral characters, like Sozo in Spore Grotto, you will receive a piece of the Holy Talisman. Four pieces will unlock a new fleece for the Lamb to wear on crusades.
The Holy Talismans take time and effort to collect, so it's likely that you will be unlocking them one at a time. Also, some of these side quests can be unthinkable, such as sacrificing sweet Ratau! Deciding which, if any, of the five bonus fleeces to trade your Holy Talisman for is a personal choice, but I ranked them based on their pros and cons to help.

As with those of the FTC and other regulators, their objections are likely to centre on the likelihood of Microsoft saddling Call Of Duty with Xbox or Gamepass exclusivity.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Have you ever been in a relationship with somebody who surprised you in all the right ways at the beginning, but eventually frustrated and disappointed you so deeply that it all ended in a messy breakup? Farlanders is my messy breakup.
It's a space colony city builder with a puzzle game mentality - and set on Mars to make things even more enticing. The best part of Farlanders is its story, and while it’s not quite a full-blown commentary on colonialism, it examines what you’re doing and why you’re doing it with a self-awareness that I did not expect at all. That being said, annoying difficulty curves, awkward terraforming, and frustrating progression systems stop this space colony sim from really taking off. A graph charting my enjoyment over time would look like a child’s drawing of a mountain.

It feels like 2022 was the year that everything that we had been waiting for since before the pandemic came out. Maybe it was studios hitting their stride with remote work or independent developers' work through the pandemic finally coming to fruition. Or maybe it was higher-ups forcing releases for profit's sake; who knows? The end result was that we saw a veritable glut of games released this year, and after the Destructoid staff voted on their pick for Game of the Year, we put the vote to you, the readers.

Players, or at least former players, of Lost Ark left more than 1300 negative reviews of the game on Saturday, and more than 1000 on Sunday. They claimed they’d received bans that appeared on their Steam profile without actually logging into the game recently.

You know, as video game TV shows go. I've yet to sit down and watch it myself, but I'll probably be doing so this evening to see what's what. 
A question I've been pondering in the run-up to The Last Of Us' TV debut, however, is this: if I watch the TV show now, will I really be bothered to actually sit down and play Part 1 when it finally comes to Steam at the beginning of March? 'Cause I sure don't have time (or the inclination) to do both. I think that might be too much The Last Of Us... But what about you, readers? Will you be tuning in, or waiting to play it on PC? Or both! Tell us in the comments below.

A number of speedruns throughout the week-long event smashed world records for their respective games and categories too, including PC runs of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge and my own personal GOTY from 2022, PowerWash Simulator.

One of the most delightful games of 2022 was Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge. From the team over at Tribute Games, it was a wonderful return to form for the heroes in a half-shell, capturing the early ‘90s era of great arcade action amidst the current resurgence of the beat’em up genre. The game dropped on all major platforms last year, and earlier this week, it finally made the jump to mobile through Netflix Games. While I’ve already enjoyed Shredder’s Revenge on my Switch, I wanted to see how it played on my Pixel with and without a Bluetooth controller. Let me tell y'all, I am not disappointed.

That was in part because, despite being set in a dark fantasy world in which you must satisfy an unyielding Queen, and despite being in early access, it's remarkably graspable. It's the kind of citybuilder where, if you place a building in the wrong place, it simply lets you pick it up and move it at no cost.

As of its latest update, there's now a new customisable game mode that lets you make your expeditions even more relaxed - or much harder.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Licensing is a killer problem
Last Friday was the 13th, and ironically, it was one of the last Fridays that you'll ever be able to buy Friday the 13th: Killer Puzzle. It's sad to see this young spatial puzzle game, not even old enough to drink, snuffed out so soon.
In all seriousness, Killer Puzzle is as loving a tribute to the slasher franchise as you could ask for. For the most part, it follows the rules of the film series (Jason can just appear behind anyone he sees, is weak against drowning, etc), and features just about every iteration of the hockey-masked horror icon as you could ask for (including his green and purple look from the infamous NES title).
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Ylirqs8To&ab_channel=BlueWizardDigital
So if you want to get this slice of the life (and afterlife) of one of the most loved and feared fictional serial killers in history, you'll have to act fast. Due to an inability to renew the license, this particular Friday the 13th game and all of its DLC are being removed from all available storefronts ( So that's Steam, Apple App Store, Google Play Store, Nintendo eShop, Xbox Store, and Playstation Store) on January 23.
The only encouraging thing about this turn of events is that Killer Puzzle was itself a retooling of an original title called Slayaway Camp that will be available indefinitely. So while this specific game in the horror-puzzle formula subgenre may be sinking into the depths of history forever, there's a chance that it may come back to the dead someday, maybe with a whole new outward-facing look.
Maybe the Killer Klowns are looking for more work?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tanks a Lot
For this week's addition to the Arcade Archives, retro-funsters Hamster have gone way back to the early gaming years of Tecmo, with a revisit of the developer's tank-based blaster Senjyo, now available to download on PS4 and Nintendo Switch.
Released to the fledgling arcade market in 1983, Senjyo, (or "Battlefield"), sees players manning the cannon of a hi-tech tank, charged with taking down an attacking force of alien invaders. The player can rotate the tank through a 360-degree landscape, utilizing radar to locate the attackers. Senjyo was highly praised in its day for using parallax scrolling and forced perspective to give the illusion of 3D visuals, though some players were frustrated by the sluggish movement of the tank itself.
Check out the action in the video below, courtesy of YouTuber Old Classic Retro Gaming.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wM2HUVMa8vQ&ab_channel=OldClassicRetroGaming
Senjyo would head to western arcades in 1984, arriving just in time for the market crash. Undaunted, developer Tehkan would eventually return with several sizeable hits for the home and arcade market, eventually changes its name to the more localization-friendly "Tecmo". As I'm sure nobody needs reminding, Tecmo would merge with Koei in 2009 to form Koei Tecmo, which is today best known for franchises such as Dead or Alive, Dynasty Warriors, Monster Rancher, and Fatal Frame.
Senjyo is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at around $8.

Peanut butter and jelly. Batman and Robin. Video games and bugs. There are just some things that go together. It doesn't matter how good or how polished a video game is — these days, it's nearly impossible to get through one without encountering a bug in one way or another, even if we don't realize it. Even in games that get a ton of continued support after launch, like Stardew Valley, which also happens to be one of my most played and loved games of all time, it's inevitable to encounter a glitch every now and again.
Squashing bugs in game development often becomes a race against a deadline as more and more issues pop up, and it seems increasingly common these days that games are shipping with glaring issues because they can simply be fixed with…]]></summary>

Following the incredible global success of Capcom's Street Fighter II, it didn't take any time at all before the market was awash in one-on-one fighters, fast eclipsing the scrolling beat-'em-ups and shmups that had dominated the scene leading into the 1990s. All of a sudden, seemingly every developer pivoted to competitive fisticuffs, with seemingly hundreds of Street Fighter-alikes hitting arcade centers — many featuring developers and IPs seemingly plucked out of thin air.
And while a few of these releases would carve out a piece of the pugilistic pie for themselves — such as Mortal Kombat and eventually The King of Fighters, there was a whole wave of titles that fell by the wayside. In most cases, this either came down to the games being poorly produced o…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What is it they say about sunk cost again?
At this point, I don't know where to start with Beyond Good & Evil 2. It holds the record for the game with the most time in development, and has become the poster child for development hell. Seeing as Ubisoft just announced a whole host of game delays and cancellations, I thought for sure the long-awaited sequel would be on that list.
Much to fans' relief, however, Ubisoft has just confirmed that Beyond Good & Evil 2 is still very much alive and well in a conversation with PCGamesN. The game's development is still "underway and the team is hard at work to deliver on its ambitious promise," an unspecified Ubisoft spokesperson disclosed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9VPnI34dPw
Beyond Good & Evil 2 was announced all the way back in 2009, but got its first trailer nearly a decade later at E3 in 2017, as well as a cinematic trailer the following year at the same event. The original is a cult classic that came out in 2003 for the PlayStation 2, GameCube, and Microsoft Windows, and even if the sequel dropped tomorrow, it would be crazy to think it skipped three whole console generations. If I had to put money on it, I'd bet it'll skip at least for by the time it eventually releases — optimistically assuming that it ever will at all.

Katamari Damacy is one of those games that you don't hear about a lot these days, and yet somehow everyone seems to have played it at some point in their lives. The premise is simple, but it's so engaging that it'll keep us coming back for more every time. Just when I thought it was impossible to improve on the tried-and-true Katamari formula, a modder came along and proved me wrong in the best way.
Originally spotted by Time Extension, computer scientist and custom controller enthusiast Dr. Tom Tilley created a "super cheap" controller setup to roll his way through the game using some empty roll-on deodorant packaging, some cardboard, a computer mouse, and a soccer ball, or football for the non-Americans. Tilley rigged the setup work with an emulated PS2 version of Katamari Damacy, and the video he posted on YouTube makes me wish I had a version of it myself.
https://youtu.be/PHPJ2wTBJlo
A roller-ball is the way to go with this game, which is evidenced by the fact that Tilley wasn't the first one to build a similar prototype -- back in 2014, a YouTuber by the name of Siage uploaded a video of another prototype for a custom Katamari controller. I think this one might actually be my favorite seeing as it swaps out the soccer ball for one plastered with the faces of Disney princesses.
I can't see a future where mass production for such controllers would make any sense, but I'd love to see some full-scale implementations in the form of some Katamari Damacy arcade machines. I want 2023 to be the year that we bring both arcades and Katamari back into the limelight of public consciousness, and then combine them together to achieve my new life's goal -- playing this game with a roller-ball controller.

That's despite the most recent swing of Ubisoft's game-cancelling scythe, which was brought down on three unannounced games last week due to the company's underperforming sales.

One of the things I have always loved about beat 'em ups was that, as a genre, they’re a blank canvas. The formula is set, you just have to build the where, why, and how behind it. This lets the developers really go wild when making some of these games. As a child of the arcade heyday, I have fond memories of classic games like Final Fight and X-Men. But one element that always stood out to me was just how batshit crazy some of the boss designs were. 
You could just tell that the developers wanted the biggest, weirdest thing to show up and make the players go “wow”, and it worked. It works so well in fact that decades later I’m here to tell you the top ten weirdest bosses in beat em ups. So put your quarter up and read ahead as we trip the light fantastic in front of the warm gl…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Desktop Dungeons is a morish puzzle game from 2010 that channels conventional dungeoning into fiendish headscratching. Every enemy sits still, waiting for you to come and whack it. Whack willy-nilly, though, and they'll kill you in no time - so you have to tactically explore parts of each level to heal, while targeting foes in an order that lets you survive long enough to level up and take on the big bads. 
Desktop Dungeons: Rewind is an upcoming "modern remastering" of the original, with 3D graphics and the ability to rewind time rather than start each level from the very beginning. It's got a demo you can play right now, and it's adding free daily challenges with a sharable leaderboard later this month. I am hyped.

Retro platformers are not hard to come by. I count myself among the group of video game players who welcome efforts from small development teams that play to our nostalgia for an era where playing video games meant tuning to channel 3. Some are fantastic, some are too hard to be enjoyable, but most land somewhere in the middle. Vengeful Guardian: Moonrider won’t go down in history as one of the greats that both embraces the past and modernizes the action, but I would place it closer to the fantastic side of the scale, even if it doesn’…]]></summary>

Yet it was also tempered fun: a brutal AI Director could easily tip manageable chaos into a fatiguing onslaught of fishy alien minibosses, and I still remember my will to persevere being sapped by connectivity issues and a general lack of weight to the otherwise enticing pew-pew gunplay.


Happily, following a year of tweaks and additions, The Anacrusis is in a much better place. Even if that place is still turtleneck-deep in extraterrestrial viscera. Ahead of the game’s first anniversary, I poked developers Stray Bombay for a chat on how their early access approach is working out, the impact of long-awaited mod tools, and what’s next for this most stylish of space shooters.

This is my second stint, jumping back in after playing for 14 hours when it came out in 2020 then abandoning it - and I'm beginning to remember why. It's a pretty but largely empty-feeling time, with woefully repetitive mission design and characters I only have a passive interest in. It's good, therefore, to see Assassin's Creed Mirage creative director Stéphane Boudon make more noises about how the next Creed game will be smaller and "more intimate".

Calling Kandria a platformer feels a little reductive, so there's a need to clarify why it works. You play as an android revived several decades after an apocalypse, by a tiny camp of survivors who inevitably need your help. A lot of this help involves, well, platforming. To the point of having nonsensical areas of pure platforming in between you and a destination or secret area. You'll climb, jump, do the little dash thing that recharges when you touch the ground or pick up a hovering lamp thingy. You'll land on a lot of thorny instakill spikes.


So yeh, lots of the old platforming, but it feels more like an exploration and scavenging game, with a side order of light-light-heavy-dodge combat too. And a plot with varied dialogue options and mysteries about the world and its history. It's immediately and consistently fun, but I'm not sure exactly how to recommend it. Hmm.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Horror movie maestro John Carpenter has ‘fessed up that he’s not directing a movie version of Dead Space, but suggests there’s another director attached to a possible big-screen adaptation. Talking to Variety about his career ahead of his 75th birthday, Carpenter was asked about rumours he could be helming a non-interactive take on Dead Space.

Fans are currently sorting through 60 gbs of unused Team Fortress 2 assets, including 20 maps, 40 man vs machine maps, and assorted intriguing models.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Writing up our big guide on all the upcoming PC games of 2023, I was introduced to a number of smaller games in development I hadn't heard about before. One of them was Broken Roads, an isometric RPG set in a post-apocalypse Australia. The gorgeous artwork was enough for me to click on the Steam page and read more, and while scrolling through the screenshots something strange caught my eye.
It was a screenshot of a fairly traditional RPG dialogue scene, with a panel at the bottom displaying all the possible dialogue options for the player. But what caught my eye was an unusual radial graphic on the right-hand side of the options. Reading on, I discovered that Broken Roads uses a rather unique Moral Compass, one which plots your overall moral stance towards the world and its people with a golden arc. Different decisions may rotate the arc, expand it, contract it, lengthen it, or shorten it. And in so doing, you'll unlock various traits dotted about the Compass, which only remain in effect for as long as that golden arc covers those traits within the wheel.
I can see a dozen different ways in which this Moral Compass may end up being a bad idea in practice. But I don't care. I adore it. And I'm going to play Broken Roads solely so I can see the consequences of my actions in satisfying radial form.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Linda Tiger's career in gaming started two decades ago, in a test house in Glasgow. “I started in QA back in 2002. I worked on functionality and localisation testing. Eventually, I became a lead and then a QA manager at a studio,” she tells me, as we talk at India Game Developers Conference in Hyderabad, India. Now, Tiger is at Paradox Development Studio as the studio manager of Studio Black, and the former lead producer for Crusader Kings 3. She even stood in front of a suit of armor to drop the game's first tease.


 An RPG-esque lifestyle system and neat backstab choices that deal with information round out Crusader Kings 3's host of improvements over its excellent predecessor. A court-themed expansion and a revamp of the game’s culture system after launch are a testament to Paradox’s resolve to deliver a refined plotting experience. Holy wars and illicit affairs go hand in hand in the world of Crusader Kings and the third iteration is no different. Weaving together systems to consistently deliver emergent gameplay is no simple feat, and it turns out that production also covers all manner of small but essential, and practical things. As the lead producer on a game as complex as Crusader Kings 3, Tiger had her work cut out for her.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Scavengers Studio revealed last month that it was releasing Season: A Letter To The Future on January 31, and now, just a few weeks ahead of that, the studio has released a gorgeous new story trailer. 
This new trailer provides yet another beautiful glimpse into the painterly world of Season while providing new details about what our protagonist is doing: archiving the end of the Earth and the final people still living on it. She strives to capture their final moments in her journal and with her camera, aiming to learn why they're still around and ultimately, what kept them going. It sounds like quite the emotional journey.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Motive Studio and publisher EA have released a new story trailer for its upcoming remake of Dead Space, and the game continues to look terrifying and beautiful. 
Due out on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC later this month on January 27, this might be one of our last looks at the remake before it's in the hands of players. Fortunately, this new trailer is nearly two minutes of cinematics and gameplay from the remake focused on the story of Dead Space. As expected, this remake isn't changing much at all, utilizing the same story from the original 2008 release with updated visuals and audio (plus some new voice lines for protagonist Isaac Clarke). 
Check out the new Dead Space Remake "Humanity Ends Here" trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, Dead Space Remake continues to look great and we can't wait to play it in just a few weeks. 
For more about the game, check out this extended Dead Space Remake gameplay look and then read why it's one of Game Informer's 25 most anticipated games of 2023. Check out Game Informer's big list of upcoming video game remakes after that.

Marvel Snap has been a resounding success since its release, allowing players to compete against other real-world players with a variety of cards, random locations, and more. Despite the positive reception, one thing players have been asking for has been missing: the ability to play against your friends. Developer Second Dinner announced in November that it was working on an update to allow friends to battle each other and now, it has announced that this update is expected at the end of the month.

Indeed, the debate over whether the little reward messages add anything to games or not has been reignited today on Twitter by developers, with Ubisoft Massive's lead gameplay designer Fredrik Thylander saying they've been actively "bad for gaming". So we thought we'd put the question to you, readers. Do you agree and think achievements have been a blight on the industry, or do you think they're actually good way of getting more out of a game? Come and tell us in the comments.

That’s looking less likely now that the US Federal Trade Commission have published a schedule that sets dates for final hearings to decide on the merger, and they're going to begin on August 2nd. As this is just the kick off for hearings about the case, it’s likely that any FTC decision on whether the $68.7 billion (£56 billion) deal can go ahead will take some time to emerge.

At least it's (sea)faring better than three other unannounced Ubisoft games, which have been cancelled thanks to Ubisoft's general underperforming sails. Sorry, sales.

That slows down once you've got a few hours under your utility belt, but developers Second Dinner have some changes in the works that should make rarer cards easier to snag. If you're saving up for a particular card from the Token Shop, it's worth checking whether it's one of 9 cards that are about to get cheaper. 
The first "Series Drop" is due to land in an update on January 31st, which will also add a mode that lets you battle your buds.

For The Elder Scrolls Online, ZeniMax Online Studios will unveil 2023's major chapter update, "including the latest regions of Tamriel to become playable in ESO, as well as a major new feature coming in the game's biggest update this year." A full "ESO Chapter Reveal Event" will follow this Developer Direct. On the Forza Motorsport side of things, Turn 10 Studios will be sharing more gameplay and new details about the game. 
Mojang Studios will showcase a new look into Minecraft Legends' upcoming PvP multiplayer experience and Arkane Austin will "showcase several minutes of gameplay" from Redfall, including both single player and multiplayer gameplay. Fans can expect to learn more about combat, customization, bosses, the open world, and more, according to Xbox.

It says that over the last four years, its strategy has been about building "long-lasting live games and adapting our strongest franchises" like Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, and Tom Clancy games like Ghost Recon, Rainbow Six, and The Division "to converging trends to make them truly global brands."

Considering it’s been three years since Katana Zero launched, I guess it’s gotten to the point where its toothbrush is next to mine. It’s not even for the reasons you might expect, either. Yes, its side-scrolling action is so buttery smooth it should come with a cholesterol warning. Its soundtrack is sublime. It looks gorgeous. But for me, the chewiest bit is the story.

The Wild Gentlemen are the developers behind noir detective game Chicken Police, making this a pleasing pivot from grizzled chickens to grizzly chic ions.

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2023/01/11/final-fantasy-16-producer-naoki-yoshida-isnt-sure-why-people-are-talking-about-a-pc"/>
        <updated>2023-01-11T13:42:07.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Final Fantasy XVI is due out June 22 exclusively on PlayStation 5, but some fans believe a PC version of the game could release as soon as six months after its console debut. However, FF16 producer Naoki Yoshida isn't sure why. 
During a recent Final Fantasy XIV stream, Yoshida, who is a director on that game, was asked about rumors surrounding a PC version of FF16, and he responded, "I don't know where the notion of a PC version releasing six months after the game is out came from as none of us have ever said that," according to a translator, as reported by Eurogamer. He followed it up with two instances urging fans to buy the PS5 version. 
According to a translation by Siliconera, Yoshida also said, "There's been talk that the PC version will come out, but no one on the team has said anything about the PC version. I wonder why people assume the PC version will arrive six months after [the PS5 version], so just go ahead and buy a PS5." 
The talk of a PC version of the game stems from a promotional PlayStation 5 video released last year that says in small print that FF16 will be a "PS5 exclusive for six months." Some extrapolated from this small print that a PC release of the game will come after that six months of exclusivity is up, but if Yoshida's recent comments are any indication, the team has nothing to say in regards to a PC version. 
Final Fantasy XVI hits PlayStation 5 on June 22. While waiting for more information, watch this "Ambition" trailer that reveals more about Valisthea's kingdoms, dominants, and eikons, and then check out our interview with Yoshida about the game's boss fights.

Case in point: Goldhawk Interactive's long-awaited Xenonauts 2 has just been confirmed to be heading to Steam early access later this year. Huzzah! The original Xenonauts was an excellent homage to the hyphenated school of X-COMs / UFO: Enemy Unknowns of old, so I'm feeling pretty pumped to find out how its sequel builds on its classic, squad-based tactics.

Every breathtaking thing down there, from jellyfish to giant squids to killer whales, either wants to kill you (see killer whales) or is so frigidly indifferent to human existence that it might as well want you dead. After all, you might be able to scare off a predator, but there’s no negotiating with an ocean current.
Aquatico promises city-building enthusiasts a deep dive into this nearly untapped environ (nearly untapped, I’ll get into that later) but while this game delivers on the ocean’s beauty, it’s disappointingly light on peril.

"Nobody said a word about a PC version release," said Yoshi P, the producer on both FFXIV and FFXVI. "Why is it like a PC version is releasing 6 months later? Don't worry about that, buy a PS5!" he said, laughing.

We've been working under the assumption that Final Fantasy 16 would come to PC after a period of PlayStation 5 exclusivity, but in fairness, that's because that's what the Final Fantasy 16 trailers have said would happen.

Now any speaking NPC in The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim can let rip with a big old Fus Ro Dah and fire you straight into the sky, thanks to the Everyone Is The Dragonborn mod.

Too many mods got waylaid in Planet Half-Life screenshot roundup hell by a desire to make everything expansive and professional-grade. So I'm delighted by a mod for 2017's Star Wars Battlefront 2 which knows its core: it is funny to see dinosaurs do things that dinosaurs shouldn't be doing. So the JurassicFront replaces character models with dinosaurs, and away you go, shooting dinos around Naboo and the Death Star. That's the joke.

First revealed back in 2014, Dead Island 2 was in development at Spec Ops: The Line developer Yager, with Dead Island developer Techland having parted ways with the property to work on Dying Light. Publisher Deep Silver handed over development of the game to LittleBigPlanet 3 developer Sumo Digital in 2016, and then, in 2019, the company announced that Homefront: The Revolution developer Dambuster Studios would be developing Dead Island 2. It's now 2023 and Dambuster's Dead Island 2 is due out in April, finally.

The next 12 months is set to be a banner year for interstellar adventuring, and kicking us off in just under four weeks time on February 2nd is KeokeN Interactive's Deliver Us Mars. As I found out last year, Deliver Us Mars looks like it's going to be quite the step up from its prequel, Deliver Us The Moon, both in terms of its cerebral, pulse-racing puzzle-solving, and its shift from a silent, first-person protagonist to fully-voiced, third-person heroine, Kathy Johanson - a fact that game director and co-founder Koen Deetman tells me has been long in the making. 
"You have to bear in mind that Deliver Us The Moon was our debut into the games industry," he tells me. "We’d envisioned multiple ways to make this the greatest game of all time, but to some extent you are bound by reality and what you can make within a budget and timeline, so some of these decisions were made out of necessity. That’s why the narrative and its scale has significantly risen with Deliver Us Mars – we’ve had the opportunity to give that side of the game a lot of more of our time and attention."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last month CJ reported that we might see a demo for Forspoken, Square Enix's upcoming action RPG with magic-infused parkour. A demo did indeed come out in December, but only on PS5 - and to very mixed reviews. It's a shame, because the world on show in its latest cinematic trailer looks appetisingly stylish. 
The game comes out on January 24th, so we'll know for sure soon enough.

Unfortunately, while superhero movies have improved dramatically over the last decade, superheroes haven’t been as powerful in the realm of video games. In fact, nearly 40 years after the first superhero video game, many developers still struggle to create worthwhile experiences using some of the biggest names in entertainment today.
While not all superhero games are monumental duds like Superman on Nintendo 64, many tend to deliver middling, forgettable experiences. However, a select few that defy the stereotype to become superb titles we still look back on fondly as not only great superhero games, but terrific video games in their own rights.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Weapon durability and its application in games have long been hot topics amongst players. Some love it, some are fine with it, and others hate it. And those feelings vary depending on who you are talking to about this topic. I think of games like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild when someone brings up weapon durability, as it was a hotly debated aspect of its release (I didn't mind it at all, personally). 
Love it or hate it, weapon durability is a feature that will likely never go away in games, and that's okay because when it's done right, it can be a helpful way to push players toward something new. In 2011's Dead Island, weapon durability was a big part of the experience, and that feature will return in Dead Island 2 when it hits PlayStation and Xbox consoles, and PC, on April 2…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Don't expect The Last of Us HBO show to extend beyond the story of the two games in the series. That's because The Last of Us game director Neil Druckmann says there are no plans for stories beyond the games in this show.
This news comes by way of a new interview with Druckmann from The Hollywood Reporter, as reported by GameSpot. Here's what Druckmann told THR specifically: "We have no plans to tell any stories beyond adapting the games. We won't run into the same issue as Game of Thrones since The Last of Us Part: II doesn't end on a cliffhanger." 


Druckmann and TV series writer Craig Mazin have mentioned that a second season of this show might cover the events of The Last of Us Part II (personally, I think The Last of Us Part II could cover two seasons of television). Despite the duo not wanting the show to go beyond the games, there might be a way for the show to cover more ground after the events of The Last of Us Part II. If Naughty Dog were to develop a theoretical The Last of Us Part III, it wouldn't be surprising if the HBO show covered that down the road. Chances seem pretty good considering Druckmann told THR that there is "more story to tell" in the world of The Last of Us games. 
Mazin also touched on his desire not to extend the show beyond the games in the THR interview, as noted by GameSpot, stating that he doesn't "have any interest in a spinning-plates-go-on-forever show." 
"When it becomes a perpetual motion machine, it just can't help but get kind of...stupid," he continued. "Endings mean everything to me." 
For more about The Last of Us on HBO, read our interview with Joel actor Pedro Pascal and Druckmann about the changes made for this TV show. Check out this new piece of concept art from The Last of Us multiplayer game that Naughty Dog is currently developing after that.

Ahead of the show’s premiere we spoke with some of the actors about the adaptation, as well as Neil Druckmann, co-creator of The Last of Us, who was heavily involved in writing the show and directed a few episodes.
Druckmann is no stranger to directing actors, even if the recording process of a TV show is different from how it works in a video game. “There is a certain luxury we have in video games that when we capture a performance, we have eve…]]></summary>

Players control Kai, a lone warrior battling an evil robotic army in a post-apocalyptic world. This side-scrolling action title boasts plenty of satisfying action thanks to Kai’s fun melee combat, nimble platforming abilities, and his signature grappling hook, which he uses to traverse levels as well as yank and toss enemies. Sporting great 16-bit art and a strong soundtrack, Gravity Circuit is worth keeping an eye on for fans of classic throwbacks. 
Join editors Wesley LeBlanc and Marcus Stewart as they explore Gravity Circuit’s free Steam demo and discuss why it may be one of the year’s most exciting indie gems.

Many JRPGs have slow openings, taking their time to establish the story and familiarize the player with the mechanics before letting them loose into the world. I figured that was the case after playing an hour of Dragon Quest Treasures, so I said to myself, “It’ll get good soon!” I said it again two hours in, three hours in, and five hours in, until eventually, I was forced to accept that this was as good as the game would get.

In 1999, Konami put the fear of fog in a generation of players with the release of Silent Hill. The eerie title eschewed the more bombastic horror of its main rival at the time, Resident Evil, in favor of more psychological frights. Protagonist Harry Mason must embark on a terrifying search for his missing daughter, Cheryl, within the eerie town of Silent Hill. What unfolds is a descent into madness that kickstarted a franchise that's (finally) returning to the limelight after years of dormancy. Join me, Marcus Stewart, along with Kyle Hilliard, as we survive Silent Hill’s debut adventure and see how its scares stack up 23 years later.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony released a sneak peek of its upcoming Gran Turismo movie yesterday evening during its CES 2023 press conference, and as expected, it features a lot of fast vehicles. 
Starring David Harbour (Stranger Things), Orlando Bloom (Pirates of the Caribbean, The Lord of the Rings), and David Barnet (Never Have I Ever), and directed by Neil Blomkamp (District 9, Elysium, Chappie), Gran Turismo is based on a true story. That story is about the GT Academy contest, which was a real contest held between 2008 and 2016 by Sony and Nissan. Winners were given entrance into Nissan's Driver Development Program, as noted by Video Games Chronicle. The film appears to be telling the tale of someone who won entrance into this program and then went on to become a real success in the racing world. 
Check out the Gran Turismo sneak peek for yourself below: 


As you can see, this sneak peek is a mix of what appears to be movie footage and behind-the-scenes footage, with stars like Harbour, Barnet, and Bloom talking about their excitement for the film. 
Gran Turismo hits theaters later this year on August 11. 
Alongside this sneak peek, Sony also revealed that Gran Turismo 7, the latest in the long-running series released last year, will be getting an update that makes the game playable on its upcoming PSVR2 platform. 
While waiting to learn more about this Gran Turismo movie, read about Project Leonardo, a new customizable accessibility controller kit PlayStation unveiled yesterday and then read about how the PlayStation 5 has surpassed 30 million units sold.

I had always observed the Fire Emblem series from a distance, worried its strategy gameplay wouldn’t be for me or stressed determining where best to start and how to play through the franchise’s various entries. Fire Emblem Three Houses was the first I gave a good try and 80-plus hours later, it’s one of my favorite games on Switch and turned me into a Fire Emblem fan. Since its reveal, I’ve looked at Fire Emblem Engage as a test bed: am I actually a Fire Emblem fan, or did I just really like Three Houses and its engaging Hogwarts-like school mechanics? If the 10 hours I’ve put into Engage so far are any indication, I’m happy to say it’s the former.

This news comes by way of the company's recent CES 2023 appearance, where PlayStation CEO Jim Ryan revealed these numbers alongside words that seem to indicate the PS5 shortage might be over, or at least coming to an end soon. PlayStation also touched on its upcoming PSVR2 release and accompanying 30-plus game lineup, and pulled back the curtains on its new customizable accessibility controller kit, Project Leonardo. 
As you can see, it seems Ryan and PlayStation are confident in the supply of PS5 consoles around the world. If you're still on the lookout for one, it seems now is the time to start searching retail stores again.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Last of Us turns 10 years old in June, and Naughty Dog plans to celebrate the milestone with an array of special announcements along the way. One of those updates involves a closer look at the upcoming standalone multiplayer title.
In a blog post, Naughty Dog co-president Neil Druckmann reflects on The Last of Us’ legacy as well as the franchise’s future. In addition to the HBO adaptation premiering on January 15 and the PC port of The Last of Us Part 1 hitting in March, Druckmann states fans will learn more about the long-awaited multiplayer experience that serves as a follow-up to the original game’s Factions mode. Druckmann writes,
“We’ll have some fun surprises for you along the way, but later this year we will begin to offer you some details on our ambitious The Last of Us multiplayer game. With a team led by Vinit Agarwal, Joe Pettinati, and Anthony Newman, the project is shaping up to be a fresh, new experience from our studio, but one rooted in Naughty Dog’s passion for delivering incredible stories, characters, and gameplay.”
Naughty Dog also shares a new piece of concept art, posted in full below, which is the first new material of the game since it released the first concept asset last June. It depicts two survivors heading toward a dilapidated cruise ship. 
Though we’ll be learning more about the game this year, it’s still unknown if Naughty Dog plans to launch it in 2023. That would be fitting given the anniversary, but we'll have to wait and see over the coming months. Until then, be sure to check out this feature on how The Last of Us Part 1 proves there's no such thing as a faithful remake.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wizards of the Coast, the company behind Dungeons & Dragons and Magic: The Gathering, has reportedly canceled five unannounced games alongside layoffs affecting "fewer than 15 people," according to a new Bloomberg report. 
The people that will lose their jobs will be given a chance to apply for new roles within WotC, but this apparent business restructuring will affect others outside of the company as well. Bloomberg reports that this reorganization will hit Otherside Entertainment and Hidden Path Entertainment, both working on games for WotC, hard. News of this change follows the release of Dungeons & Dragons: Dark Alliance's release last year, which didn't fare too well with critics and players, amidst Larian Studios' continued development on Baldur's Gate 3 (which does not seem to be affected by this reorganization despite WotC serving as the game's publisher). 
These two games, in part, represented WotC's bigger forray into the video game space as Bloomberg reports that the company had signed contracts with several studios to make games. WotC also "built at least six of its own game studios," according to the publication. 
One project in the works that is now canceled went under the codename "Jabberwocky," according to Bloomberg, and two more externally developed games early in development are no longer moving forward as well. These cancelations and layoffs comes as parent company Hasbro's shares fell 40% last year. 
Wotc told IGN that it remains "committed to using digital games as a cornerstone of our strategy for bringing our games to players around the world," adding that it has "made some changes to our long-term portfolio to focus on games which are strategically aligned with developing our existing brands and those which show promise in expanding or engaging our audience in new ways."

Roughly 300 QA workers at ZeniMax voted to indicate they wish to join this union, equating to a supermajority vote, and Microsoft has opted to recognize it. This lines up with what Microsoft said last month, where it announced that if these workers vote to unionize, it would voluntarily recognize the union. ZeniMax is the first studio in Microsoft's umbrella of teams to unionize and it's also now the largest group of unionized QA testers at any US-based studio.

Fall Guys enjoyed a bit of a renaissance in 2022. In addition to its usual deluge of seasonal content updates, it went free-to-play in May and launched on Xbox and Switch, gaining a larger player base of contestants and renewed interest in general. We look forward to seeing what 2023 brings for the title, but this is a pretty good start.

        <updated>2023-01-03T17:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Polish developer The Astronauts have revealed a new trailer for their upcoming rogue-lite shooter Witchfire. In addition to showing off some new gameplay clips, it announces that the game will use NVIDIA DLSS3 technology, which a press release says will "massively boost performance." You can watch the trailer below.


Announced by NVIDIA last September, DLSS 3 can boost a game's performance by a significant margin. One demo on NVIDIA's site shows two instances of Cyberpunk 2077 running at 96 FPS with ray tracing still enabled. "DLSS 3 allows the seemingly impossible, high framerate without compromising the visuals," Adrian Chmielarz, creative director and co-founder of The Astronauts says in a press release. "A no brainer for a game like Witchfire, which is both action and beauty."
Witchfire is a dark fantasy first-person shooter from the creators of Painkiller, Bulletstorm, and The Vanishing of Ethan Carter. Set in an alternate reality, players are caught in the middle of a war between witches and the Church, and must use weapons and powers from Vatican sorcerers to defeat their enemies. 
The game is set to enter Early Access in the Epic Games Store sometime later this year, though that wasn't always the case. It was delayed last October because the team decided to overhaul the world's design and make it more open. This trailer is a good indication that the studio is still hard at work, though; here's hoping that "early 2023" ends up being as soon as possible.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[New year, new content: Cult of the Lamb is getting a "major content update" sometime in 2023. According to a Twitter thread posted to the official Cult of the Lamb account, this update will introduce features many players have requested, including accessibility improvements, quality-of-life features, new difficulty options, and more depth.
This Major Content Update will release in 2023 and be FREE to all players!

December 30, 2022
The biggest change they showcase in this thread is the introduction of heavy attacks, which can be activated by holding down the attack button. These are more than slow swings that do more damage; in Cult of the Lamb, every heavy attack has a unique effect. For example, the sword's heavy attack smashes the ground, doing an explosion of damage that harms any enemy caught in its range. Meanwhile, the dagger creates a line of knives that fall from the sky, and the axe can be thrown around like a boomerang. This is just the tip of the iceberg; developer Massive Monster says it's "just one small tidbit" of what's still to come.
The update should come soon, but not that soon. The last tweet of the thread clarifies that the developers are currently working on a patch to fix some console bugs and that the major update won't be released until after that. Their release window also isn't any more specific than "2023," so it could come out any time this year.

        <updated>2023-01-03T15:24:03.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[IO Interactive has announced that Hitman 3 will become Hitman World of Assassination later this month and will include all levels from Hitman 1 and Hitman 2 in it for free. 
More specifically, this big update for the Hitman trilogy arrives on January 26 and includes two major changes: 
"Hitman 3 will become 'Hitman World of Assassination,' which will also include access to Hitman 1 and Hitman 2 through our existing Access Pass system. Current Hitman 3 owners will get a free upgrade to Hitman World of Assassination on all platforms."
"We're drastically simplifying the purchase experience for new players. Hitman World of Assassination will be the single experience option to start playing." 


This update makes it so that all Hitman 3 owners will have the same base content ownership, and it attempts to eliminate confusion over which edition to buy to obtain certain levels by making it so that there is only one purchase option. The other DLC will apparently still be available for purchase, but owning all the IO Interactive Hitman trilogy levels will be easier than ever now. 
Hitman World of Assassination will cost $70, and it includes Hitman 3, the Hitman 1 Game of the Year Access Pass, and the Hitman 2 Standard Access Pass. You can also purchase the Hitman World of Assassination Deluxe Pack for $30 to get the Hitman 3 Deluxe Pack, the Hitman 3 Seven Deadly Sins Collection, and the Hitman 2 Expansion Access Pass. 
"Those are the only two products that new players need to consider when buying any Hitman game digitially as of January 26, 2023," IO writes in a blog post. "The changes have also been made with the Freelancer game mode in mind, where being able to easily access all locations from across the World of Assassination is parmount to maximizing your enjoyment." 
In the meantime, read Game Informer's Hitman 3 review and then read about the new Hitman 3 Freelancer mode.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The long-in-development remake of System Shock will finally be released this March. 
This news comes by way of a new Kickstarter update from developer Nightdive Studios, which states the team has picked "a few last things to share before our quickly approaching launch window of March 2023." as reported by Video Games Chronicle. This remake, which is set to hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC has had a 2023 release year attached to it for a minute now, but this new Kickstarter update points attention to the game's Steam page, which now features a "March 2023" release window.

        <updated>2023-01-03T13:47:07.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Starbreeze Studios and publisher Koch Media have released a new teaser trailer that calls 2023 "the year of PayDay 3." Presumably, this means the co-op shooter is still on track to release sometime this year. 
Koch gave PayDay 3 a 2023 release window way back in March of 2021, detailing the game's new publishing deal alongside news that there is at least 18 months of post-launch support planned for the title. Later that year, in June, Koch released a new piece of concept art, citing that PayDay 3 will feature a "fully-fledged social heist universe" set within a Hollywood-like setting. That was the last we saw of PayDay 3 until yesterday, when IGN revealed the "official reveal trailer" for the game, although considering how little is shown in it, it's less of a reveal and more of a teaser. 
Check out this new PayDay 3 trailer below: 


As you can see, there's not much to this trailer other than it calling 2023 "the year of PayDay 3." Here's hoping that holds true.

        <updated>2023-01-03T13:16:25.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Starfield, the new and upcoming sci-fi RPG from Skyrim makers Bethesda Softworks, was originally due out in November of 2022, but it was delayed to the first half of 2023 last May. Starfield was then a big part of an Xbox showcase last summer and during that showcase, Microsoft revealed that every game shown would be coming in the first half of 2023. 
Now, a new Bethesda support page for the game has reconfirmed this "first half of 2023" window, as spotted by Klobrille on Twitter.
"Starfield arrives exclusively on Xbox Series X/S and PC in the first half of 2023," the support page reads.
This isn't the biggest surprise; Xbox has discussed this release window for Starfield on two occasions before this support page, but it seems the company is really dedicated to getting it out in the coming months. 
While waiting for an official release date, read about why Bethesda's Starfield delay is key to its new-gen success and then check out this story about how your Starfield character will not have a voice. Read about how Starfield's ambitious scale might be worrisome after that and then read about how Xbox Series X/S first-party games will cost $70 starting this year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I made 12 little games (analog and digital) over the course of my MFA program. However, I dedicated most of that time to my thesis. By graduation, I’d worked as a writer/narrative designer on prototypes, vertical slices, documentation – you name it. And after many adjustments, my thesis even won a highly competitive grant to assist post-grad development! Short deadlines and secondary assignments led to high-stress periods, albeit in a controlled, academic environment, but the lessons about collaboration and creativity were invaluable.
It’s an ordinary school night, and I’m in a video call with my friend Jude. I watch them casually scroll through graffiti-adjacent concept art and brief clips of a passion project called Ponch: Cyberspace Investigator. They give me a rundown of the game’s mechanics, inspirations, and vibe, which includes phrases like “platformer,” “Ace Attorney-inspired dialogue puzzles,” “detective work,” and “hack the internet.” Read more...]]></summary>

DokeV
DokeV feels like the “everything” video game, and it almost looks too good to be true. This delightfully colorful title is, among other things, part MMO, part open-world sandbox, part Pokemon, part Ghostbusters, and part llama-riding simulator. Name something that’s fun, and DokeV probably has it. The project has been in the works for at least a couple of years by Pearl Abyss, best known for its popular MMO, Black Desert Online…]]></summary>
