Friday 21st April 1989 — the day that the Game Boy launched in Japan. 33 years ago the video gaming landscape would be forever changed as Nintendo opened up the new frontier of portable gaming to the masses. The company’s Game & Watch line let you take limited gaming experiences on-the-go, but the Game Boy was a different beast entirely.

Marvelous and XSEED Games sure have given us a bit of a shock today! First Studios, the developers of the action-packed mech combat game Daemon X Machina is following its debut title up with a survival action game called Deadcraft. And it's coming to all platforms pretty soon, on 19th May.
That's a heck of a switch-up from their first game, right? But it looks just as red and stylised. Your goal will be to fight for your life while growing an army of undead minions. Sound familiar? Well, protagonist Reid is half-human, half-zombie, and this gives him some interesting and unique powers that allow him to command his undead zombie forces, as well as defeat opponents with.

Have you seen those whackadoo adverts for mobile games where the sedate match-3 mechanics are apparently just the coat of paint on a story about your man-murdering grandma? Well, it looks like Wylde Flowers took the idea of "cute game + grandma with dark secrets" and ran with it, as you can see from the trailer above.
The first half of the trailer shows the protagonist learning to craft, farm, and meet all the locals, but the second half exposes granny's underground wizard cult. You can seemingly use magic to aid in your plant-growing, animal-rearing lifestyle... and maybe even help you out with dating. A host of "interested parties" are ready and willing to take you on picnics and eventually marry you, so you may not even need magic after all.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ni no Kuni: Cross Worlds, an MMORPG that launched in Asian territories last year, heads to the west this summer. The game is a multiplayer take on Level-5 and Studio Ghibli’s whimsical universe made by developer Netmarble, and you can pre-register for free on mobile devices beginning today. 


Cross Worlds boasts a new story and the signature Studio Ghibli animation style from the first two titles (the game is made in Unreal Engine 4). The narrative centers on the player character, who hails from a futuristic city, playing what they believe to be a virtual reality game called Soul Divers. However, they discover the fantasy world they’ve entered is very much real, and a mysterious girl named Rania tasks you with rebuilding her world’s kingdom to save both of your realities. 
Players suit up as one of five classes: Swordsman, Witch, Engineer, Rogue, and Destroyer. You’ll explore an expansive world filled with NPCs to befriend and monsters to slay, as well as collect Familiars that can be tamed to fight alongside you. The Kingdom can be built up and decorated using interactive objects along with maintaining your own personal farm. Multiplayer includes both PvE and PvP modes.  
Pre-registering on the App Store or Google Play gets you the Explorer’s Outfit. Joining the game’s Discord nets you the Catarumpus Hat and a special title. 
Ni no Kuni: Cross Worlds is slated to release stateside on iOS and Android in early summer. It will also be playable on PC.]]></summary>

The revival sees the boxing marsupial on a journey to find his missing sister and discover the truth behind his father’s disappearance. A fresh trailer for the colorful action platformer sets the table for the story and gameplay.  


Kao the Kangaroo is the first installment in the series since 2005, which debuted on Dreamcast and appeared on PlayStation 2, Game Boy Advance, and PC over three games. PAX East attendees can play the game at developer Tate Multimedia’s booth this week. Kao the Kangaroo will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.]]></summary>

It all centres around the creepy original Altered, Erishkigal, who exudes some serious Zuul vibes and is named after the Sumerian goddess of the underworld. I googled it. With Worldslayer, People Can Fly say they're delving more into the extraterrestrial shenanigans of Enoch’s backstory.

The Switch is home to quite a few charming games that encourage you to unwind and be creative, with Townscaper being a relatively recent example. Another title with a similar vibe and approach is on the way, in this case with a focus on combining decaying landscapes / dioramas with nature - Cloud Gardens will launch on 12th May, priced at £13.99 / $17.99 USD / €14.99 / ¥1840 SRP.
From developer Noio (with Coatsink publishing on Switch), it's a game that has received near-universal praise from players on Steam, and looks rather lovely in the trailer. A nice touch is that it does have a campaign, progression and goals, too, if you want more than a sandbox in which to create:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge finally has a release window, and the hotly-anticipated throwback is set to arrive sometime this summer. 
A new extended gameplay trailer shows off the game’s first two levels with all four Turtles getting a spotlight. Publisher Dotemu also brings exciting news that the Turtles' original voice actors from the 1987 cartoon reprise their roles in Shredder’s Revenge. The action gets another big dose of nostalgia with Cam Clarke (Leonardo), Townsend Coleman (Michelangelo), Barry Gordon (Donatello), and Rob Paulsen (Raphael) spouting one-liners in the midst of battle as a result. 


Those attending PAX East this week have the opportunity to play Shedder’s Revenge for the first time at Dotemu’s expo hall booth (#12043, if you’re curious). The rest of us will have to wait to play the game on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC. Dotemu announced that Limited Run Games will produce physical copies of the digital-only title sometime after launch. Shredder's Revenge's soundtrack, composed by Tee Lopes, will get a digital release down the line as well.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The April Update for Amazon Game Studios and Tripod Studio and Smilegate RPG’s Lost Ark, titled Battle For The Throne Of Chaos, is out today and it brings with it new content, quality of life updates, a batch of bug fixes, and the arrival of the Glaivier sub-class teased just last week. 
The big highlight of this update is the new advanced class, the Glaivier. Lost Ark was taken offline for maintenance around 12 a.m. PT/3 a.m. ET and is expected to remain under maintenance for eight hours, meaning it should return online with the Glaivier and the big update in just a few hours. 


“Practicing an artistic and deadly form of martial arts, the Glaivier slices her way through the battlefield, weaving together attacks with her spear and glaive,” the Lost Ark patch notes read. “The Glaivier has …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Player 2 has left the game.
Since launching back in 2017, Switch's success has arguably been down to its chameleon-like ability to suit any gamer's preferred style of play. You can play it where you want and how you want. The ability to crack off the Joy-Con for impromptu multiplayer sessions on the TV (or on-the-go) makes it the go-to console for gaming sessions with friends. Everyone loves a bit of couch co-op, right?
However, while it's easy to focus on the console's local multiplayer potential, its portability also lends itself perfectly to engrossing single-player experiences, and in the list below we've collected together the very best single player games on Switch.

But for now we may have doubled up again, as we talk about games that have other, smaller games in them, like a Kinder Egg or a novelty casino.
Before that we have a big more egg chat to get out of the way, and a decent discussion on some of Henry Cavill's recent activities. Also I complain about how there are too many Marvel heroes now and they need to kill a load of them off. Plus, in exciting news Nate manages to do his first ever accurate impression, by accident.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Paradox Interactive has revealed that the Shadowrun Trilogy is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Switch this summer. 
More specifically, the newly-remastered trilogy will hit these consoles on June 21. This will be the first time these cyberpunk-fantasy RPGs have ever been released on console, having been previously exclusive to PC. The trilogy includes three games, as the name suggests: the original PC game, Shadowrun Returns, Shadowrun: Dragonfall – Director’s Cut, and Shadowrun: Hong Kong – Extended Edition, all fully remastered. 


“The Shadowrun Trilogy, a remastered release of the Shadowrun Returns RPGs originally released by Harebrained Schemes, has been updated for a console experience, with upscaled graphics, improved performance, and controller-optimized gameplay,” a press release reads. “All three titles in the series will launch simultaneously for the Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation 5, and are available for preorder on all platforms as of today.” 
Shadowrun Returns was originally funded via Kickstarter in just 28 hours, and it was the first Kickstarter-funded game to launch after raising more than $1 million on the fundraising platform, according to the press release. Shadowrun Returns, and the rest of the trilogy, is based on the Shadowrun tabletop RPG created by Jordan Weisman, who also helped design Shadowrun Returns. 
Shadowrun Trilogy will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Switch on June 21 and it will cost $39.99. 
For more, read Game Informer’s reviews of Shadowrun Returns, Shadowrun: Dragonfall, and Shadowrun: Hong Kong.

Switch Retail eShop - New Releases
Ganryu 2 (Just For Games, 22nd April, £17.99) - Ganryu 2 is the sequel to the Ganryu game made by VISCO on NEOGEO back in 1999. The universe takes place in a feudal fantasy Japan which is strongly inspired by the story of Takezo Musashi, whose adventures are unfolded in a series of books (mainly "The Stone and the Sword").Play as Miyamoto Musashi and travel through a 17th century fantasy Japan, from north to south to the island of Ganryu-jima where everything started between Musashi and Kojiro. Story: After his victory against Kojiro, Musashi decided to meditate and try his hand at art, in the north of Japan, in the province of Hokkaido. During one of his meditations, a spirit contacted him : "Miyamoto Musashi, our fight is not over, I am waiting for you to finish our fight once and for all! All of Japan will pay for your insult! I'm waiting for you Miyamoto Musashi!” There is no doubt for Musashi that the voice was the Sasaki Kojirō’s one. His body was defeated, but his spirit remains, and his intentions are still destructive. Miyamoto Musashi then understood that he would have to travel across Japan from north to south and go to the island of Ganryû-jima, where he firstly defeated Sasaki Kojirō, to fight again and liberate the spirit of Kojiro forever.

Glaivier is the new advanced class and she’s proper into orchestral djent judging by the trailer. The Glaivier features two skill sets, Focus and Flurry, linked to one of the ridiculously huge pointy sticks she wields: spear for fast attacks in Focus and glaive for sweeping hits in Flurry. Smilegate say a successful Glaivier can maximise their effectiveness by building up energy with one skill set for a stat boost when swapping to the other. It looks like she can really tear things up with superfast twizzles and dazzly stabbiness.

Not in the sense that is has nothing left to give, but that it feels ready to give even more. It's a rip-roaring blast through a cyberscape that doubles as a skatepark for your chainsaw leg. And amidst the sick grinds and spilling of guts you're drip fed weapons and power-ups that only serve to keep the momentum ticking over. You won't concentrate on anything harder in your lifetime. That's a guarantee.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson and his production company, Seven Bucks Productions, will produce the movie treatment of Hazelight Studios’ It Takes Two. 
This news comes by way of Variety, which reports that not only is Johnson producing the movie, but it is being developed by Amazon, seemingly set for an Amazon Prime Video release (or perhaps a theater premiere, which Amazon has done for some of its movies in the past). Johnson will produce the film on behalf of Seven Bucks Production, alongside Dany Garcia and Hiram Garcia, and dj2 Entertainment will help produce it as well. 


Variety reports that its sources say that Johnson could also star in the film, but that’s obviously not official yet. As expected, this film adaptation of 2021’s It Takes Two, which won Game Of The Year at The Game Awards 2021 in December, will follow main characters May and Cody who are turned into dolls by their daughter amidst divorce proceedings. May and Cody must work together to explore fantasized areas of their home to regain their bodies while confronting the issues of their relationship.
It’s one of the best games of 2021, and you can find out why in Game Informer’s It Takes Two review. The film could shape up to be just as good, based on the team behind it. Sonic the Hedgehog and Sonic the Hedgehog 2 writers Pat Casey and Josh Miller are adapting the game for the silver screen, according to Variety, and they will also serve as executive producers alongside Hazelight Studios’ Josef Fares, who directed the game version of It Takes Two. 
For more, read Game Informer’s It Takes Two review and then check out our thoughts on Fares’ other games, like A Way Out and Brothers – A Tale Of Two Sons.

If you're a fan of Fortnite-style third-person shooters or the free-to-play action-RPG phenomenon (that was supposed to be coming to Switch, remember?) Genshin Impact... well, you're probably best off sticking to those unless you're a sucker for a Super Soaker.
Yes, Waifu Impact is coming to Switch on 28th April from publisher JanduSoft and developer Mitsuki Game Studio, and it's none too subtle about the influences being invoked through its visuals and general premise. Island? Check. Genshin-style logo? Obvs. Anime ladies with water guns and bikinis? Natch.

Loopmancer is an upcoming cyberpunk time-looping action roguelite by eBrain Studio poised to slash its way to your living room this year. The game looks promising, and I got to test my mettle against a demo to see how well it’s shaping up. 
The story centers on a detective named Xiang Zixu, who gets killed during a mission tracking an underground crime lord. However, he awakens back in his apartment earlier that morning. That’s right, our officer is trapped in a mysterious loop, but he retains memories of his past “lives.” Figuring out the cause of this loop will be one of the core plot points, and eBrain…]]></summary>

According to the 'NinStatusBot' Twitter account, the SEGA Genesis / Mega Drive app will be down for scheduled maintenance on Friday 22nd April from 00:55 UTC to 02:00 UTC.

        <updated>2022-04-21T12:02:49.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony has delayed Spider-Man: Across The Universe, the highly anticipated sequel to 2018’s Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse, from Oct. 7 to June 2, 2023. 
This marks a nearly eight-month delay for the animated sequel that is set to star Shameik Moore and Hailey Steinfeld as Miles Morales and Gwen Stacy, respectively, as reported by Deadline. When Across The Spider-Verse was previously revealed, it was shown to be a Part I, with Spider-Man: Across The Spider-Verse Part II slated to release after it. More specifically, it’s dated for March 29, 2024. 
As for why this delay has happened, that remains unclear. Sony hasn’t stated why Across The Spider-Verse Part I has been delayed. However, considering we’re in a pandemic, it’s possible the delay is related to COVID-19, which has caused delays across the movie industry, games industry, and more. Or perhaps, more simply, the filmmaking team needs more time. 
Into The Spider-Verse made roughly $375 million worldwide at the box office and considering the franchise is even more popular now than it was upon release, there’s a good chance Across The Spider-Verse easily eclipses that. Only time will tell, though. 
Deadline’s report also states that Sony’s other animated movie, Lyle, Lyle, Crocodile has moved up from its Nov. 18 date to Oct. 7, taking Across The Spider-Verse’s original release date. Elsewhere in Sony’s somewhat disjointed Spider-Man-related universe, Madame Web, which will star Euphoria’s Sydney Sweeney and Fifty Shades Of Grey’s Dakota Johnson, has received a July 7, 2023 release date. 
While waiting for Across The Spider-Verse, read Game Informer’s Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales review to find out why it’s a great Spider-Man game, and then check out the reveal of Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 after that. If you need even more comic book games in your life, watch this reveal of Insomniac’s Wolverine game.

And we won't have to wait long to delve into this dungeon, as the game launches on Switch on 12th May.
Dungeons of Dreadrock sees you travel through 100 bespoke levels within Dreadrock Mountain to save your brother from being sacrificed. You'll find Zelda-esque puzzles within each level, and the little gal you play as even has a green hood!

Previously, the only way to update the wireless controller was the plug it into an actual PS5 – not a problem if you’ve managed to find one in stock, of course, but bad news if you bought the pad standalone to play on your PC.


Per Sony’s announcement tweet, you can download the app directly from the PlayStation site. 64-bit Windows 10 and Windows 11 are both supported, and using it is pretty easy: just connect the controller via its USB cable and click through a full steps. The single catch is you can only update one controller at a time.

When we usually report on patents, it's for controller designs, new hardware, and sometimes even tweaks and modes for a specific game. Today, we've discovered that Nintendo has filed something that's related to the last thing, but will actually help streamline game development for all of their IPs on Switch.
This recently-filed patent is for a process called deformation — this is something that stops clothing textures from seeping into an in-game character model. So, y'know, no awkward lack of cape swishing because it's blending into Mario's thigh or something. And no accidental exposed skin in wintery areas. We wouldn't want Link to get cold in the Hebra region, would we?

It's been reduced to $290 when you use code 4FSBR2Z26 at the checkout, compared to a launch price of $450. Not bad for a CPU that launched less than two years ago - and a damn sight cheaper than upgrading to a 12th-gen system that requires a new CPU, motherboard and potentially expensive new DDR5 RAM as well.

Marvel's Avengers launched with six playable characters, but that's far from all the heroes we'll be able to take control of when it's all said and done.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this week, a leaked release date of July 29 for the long-awaited Digimon Survive made the rounds on gaming websites and social media. Today, Bandai Namco made it official.
In a succinct video message, Digimon Survive producer Kazumasa Habu confirmed the July date, which appears to be the worldwide release given that pre-orders are now live on retail sites. Check out his message below. 


The release confirmation ends a long wait for Digimon fans; Survive was first announced in 2018 with a 2019 release window. The turn-based strategy game stars a group of teens who find their way to the Digital World, and their respective Digimon partners, during a school camping trip. Goggles-wearing protagonist Takuma Momozuka and his buddy Agumon lead this gang to rescue the world from an unknown threat. You can watch the recent English teaser trailer here. 
Digimon Survive will be available on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you've ever wanted to be a Ghostbuster (and let's be honest, we all have), a new game from the minds at VR studio nDreams is bringing specter hunting to Meta Quest 2 to help you fulfill that fantasy. 
nDreams, the developers behind VR experiences like Phantom: Covert Ops, Fracked, and Far Cry VR: Dive Into Insanity is partnering with Sony Pictures Virtual Reality to make Ghostbusters VR (working title) virtually a reality. This new Ghostbusting experience will let you team up with up to three friends in VR to track down the paranormal and blast them with your Proton Packs to trap them and take them back to your HQ. Players will run that headquarters in San Francisco, a city never explored in the Ghostbusters franchise. nDreams is promising an "expansive and engrossing" campaign that can be played alone or in co-op.


The trailer released today, while an in-engine cinematic, is not actual gameplay, but there are some hints as to what the game may look like when it's released, including fun character customizations like the cute animal hat worn by one of the 'Busters. 
There's no date on when the now-called Ghostbusters VR will hit Meta Quest 2, but a press release claims more information will become available in the coming months. But GBVR isn't the only Ghostbusters game in the works, as Illfonic's Ghostbusters: Spirits Unleashed, an asymmetrical multiplayer title is coming later this year.]]></summary>

When we featured the upcoming Saints Row reboot on our cover last year, I was able to play around in the vast open world of Santo Ileso. There, I could explore freely, take part in story missions, complete side missions, and even expand the Saints' empire through the fun Criminal Ventures mission chains. However, one area I wasn't privy to was the customization suite, a significant part of the Saints Row package since its earliest days. When I asked about customization last year, I was given small tidbits of information, but developer Volition playe…]]></summary>

Following a 2019 reveal that had fans thinking Overwatch 2 was within reach, the development team at Blizzard went dark following a series of delays and departures of key team members (including Overwatch director Jeff Kaplan). As the development timeline stretched on, the once-abundant and enthusiastic player base showed signs of dwindling and discouragement as live-service support for the first Overwatch dried up.
However, last month, Blizzard emerged from its largely incommunicado state to reveal that Overwatch 2's PvP and PvE content has been decoupled and that it's holding a PvP beta…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Moss: Book II will only be a PlayStation VR exclusive for a short time because the adventure will soon be available on the Meta Quest 2 headset. Developer Polyarc announced during the Meta Quest Showcase today that Moss II would arrive on the platform this summer.
Moss II on Meta Quest 2 will have more freedom in the way it's played, according to Polyarc. The move to a newer headset like the Quest allows players to utilize both Quest controllers as opposed to a single DualShock controller like in the PS5/PS4 edition. Polyarc says it lets players perform actions such as engaging with the weapon inventory system during combat.
“One of the first things we heard when we launched Moss: Book II on PlayStation VR a few weeks ago was that the Quest 2 community wanted to play it, and we’re going to deliver on that in the very near future,” said Polyarc CEO Tam Armstrong, in a press release shared with Game Informer. “Our goal from day one has been getting the Moss franchise onto as many headsets as possible. We want all VR players to have the opportunity to experience the joy of physical interaction and power of the emotional resonance we’ve been building into the worlds we create. We’re excited to share our game with millions of Quest 2 players around the world this summer.”
An exact release date was not shared for Moss: Book II, but we can't wait to try it out on a Quest 2 sometime this summer. If you want to dig into Moss: Book II and have a PlayStation VR, the game is ready to download and play there.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've enjoyed building a house of card in Stacklands, and farms of cards, and lumberyards of cards, and... it's a new manage-o-strategy game where every building, resource, and unit is a card on a table. It's a cute conceit and fun, especially because it treats the virtual tabletop as a physical space. Your own farm animal cards will unhelpfully jostle your setup as they roam, for example, and invading monster cards will chase your villager cards across the tabletop. It's all very pleasant, a little adventure to figure out how it all works then reach the end.

        <updated>2022-04-20T15:12:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sega formally unveiled Sonic Origins today, a remastered and enhanced collection of classic Sonic games arriving this June. It also revealed that the title comes in two editions along with a few pre-order bonus packs. 
The game’s website shares a chart (pictured above) breaking down each version of the game and various pre-order bonuses. If you’re having trouble making sense of it, we don't blame you. It's confusing at first glance, so here’s a plain breakdown of what it entails. 
The Standard Edition, which is just the game, costs $39.99. The Digital Deluxe version runs for $44.99 and includes the game plus the following items: 
Hard Missions
Letterbox background
Character animation in main menu
Camera controls over main menu islands
Character animations during music islands
Exclusive tracks from Genesis/Mega Drive titles
With us so far? Good. Now, there are three content packs, two of which are unavailable for purchase at the moment. They are: 
Start Dash Pack (included with digital pre-orders of Standard or Digital Deluxe Editions)
100 Medallion bonus
Mirror Mode unlocked
Letterbox background (Genesis/Mega Drive Pattern)
Premium & Classic Sound Packs (Coming soon)
Exclusive tracks from Genesis/Mega Drive titles
Premium Fun Pack (Coming soon)
Hard missions
Letterbox background
Character animation in main menu
Camera controls over main menu islands
Character animations during music islands
Basically, the Classic Sound and Fun Packs are just the bonuses included in the Digital Deluxe edition but slightly divided. Hopefully that helped you figure out what you're getting and where. 
Sonic Origins launches June 23 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sega has unveiled the first trailer for Sonic Origins, the remastered collection of Sonic’s best Genesis-era titles first teased last May. 
Origins remasters Sonic 1, Sonic 2, Sonic 3/Knuckles, and Sonic CD with the sharper resolution, new and improved animations, and fun tweaks such as the ability to play as Sonic's two sidekicks across any game. That’s right; you can finally smash through Sonic 1’s Marble Zone as Knuckles. 
If you’d rather keep it vintage, a Classic Mode lets players enjoy these games in their original forms. Conversely, Anniversary Mode features a full-screen display and infinite lives for those who want to tour each adventure stress-free. Sonic Origins incentivizes gameplay with new in-game missions that reward medallions. Spending this currency in the game’s Vault unlocks new content and grants access to a Special Stage. Origins also sports new cutscenes in the style of Sonic Mania's animated cinematics.


Sonic Origins launches on June 23 – Sonic’s 31st birthday – on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC. The Standard Edition runs for $39.99, but there are two versions and a few content packs you can read all about here.

This got me thinking about pirate games again, as I do every 12-18 months or so. Everyone likes the pirate concept, and there is, I think, a collective urge to make piratey games. There are a bunch of them, after all. But there hasn't yet been one that I think provides exactly what I want from a pirate game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands has been out for less than a month and already, Gearbox has released the first DLC for it. 
Titled Coiled Captors, this DLC seems centered on some kind of snake creature or creatures that control what’s going on in the new locale within the fleshy prison of the Mirror of Mystery. This new area looks especially frozen, with plenty of icy terrain and frost-covered enemies to defeat.
You can watch the Coiled Captors launch trailer below: 


As you can see, it features more of the zany and wacky adventures those who have played Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands are already familiar with. The trailer also reveals that Coiled Captors comes with a new frozen dungeon and in it, you must free the “mad god.” Gearbox says each week, the challenge evolves with powerful new gear, wondrous new cosmetics, and more. 
Coiled Captors looks great, especially if you’re in need of new Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands content and fortunately, you don’t have to wait long, or at all really, because this DLC is available now. 
For more, read Game Informer’s Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands review and then check out all the details we know about Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands’ season pass, which includes four content drops. Read about Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands Chaos Chamber endgame dungeon after that.

As for when to expect Jane Foster’s Mighty Thor, Crystal Dynamics says sometime after Update 2.5, which will be released sometime after Update 2.4 hits the game next month. 
“Beyond that will be Update 2.5, and while we’ll be coming back with specifics on timing later, we can share that it will introduce a new playable Hero for all platforms: Jane Foster: The Mighty Thor,” Crystal Dynamics’ blog post reads. “Our Hero designs are driven first and foremost by their core comic book identities,…]]></summary>

Bruce Campbell, the face of the franchise, joins us today for another Rapid-Fire interview! We're grilling The Chin on the upcoming game from developer Saber Interactive, whether or not he will make an appearance in the next Doctor Strange film, and so much more.
PSA: There is explicit language throughout today's video.

Finally, we play a few games with the legend, set the record straight on some internet facts, and take him through an acting exercise that fans won't want to miss.

As previously announced, the PlayStation 5 launch title Bugsnax makes its debut along with its free expansion, The Isle of Bigsnax, hitting the same day (across all platforms). Joining Bugsnax will be the launch of the 2D action RPG Unsouled (pictured above), the quirky Zelda-esque Turnip Boy Commits Tax Evasion, and more.

Additionally, Microsoft announces its working with Ubisoft to bring more of the publisher’s games to Game Pass. That initiative kicks off with Assassin’s Creed Origins and For Honor: Marching Edition become available on Game Pass sometime within the next two months via the Ubisoft Connect App. Ubisoft games are no stranger to Game Pass. Rainbow Six Extraction hit the library at launch in January, and Rainbow Six Siege and the base version of For Honor have been available through the service as well. But with the long-running rumor that Ubisoft's Uplay will be rolled into a Game Pass subscription a la EA Play, this move could be the first step towards that reality.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Skydance New Media, the studio helmed by famed writer Amy Hennig, has announced it partnered with Lucasfilm Games to develop a new Star Wars title.
The upcoming game is described in a press release as a “richly cinematic action-adventure game” that will feature an original story. That’s about all there is in terms of details, as the project appears very early in development. 
“I’ve often described how seeing Star Wars in 1977 essentially rewired my 12-year-old brain, shaping my creative life and future indelibly,” said Hennig in the press release. “I’m elated to be working with Lucasfilm Games again to tell interactive stories in this galaxy that I love.”
Hennig, best known as the chief creative mind behind the Uncharted series, is no stranger to working on the Star Wars license. Her last foray into the universe was EA’s ill-fated Project Ragtag, the canceled Star Wars title by the now-defunct Visceral Games.  
This marks the second major project for Skydance New Media, which was formed in 2019. Last October, Hennig announced her team was developing an original story-focused action-adventure Marvel game as its first title. We still don’t know anything about that game either, but having now two major Disney properties under its belt are big gets for the young studio. 
Now that the Star Wars license is no longer exclusive to EA, this new project joins the pile of several upcoming games from a variety of studios. Quantic Dreams’ Star Wars Eclipse was announced last December, and Ubisoft’s mysterious open-world game hasn't made a peep since its announcement last year.]]></summary>

Tretton continued his work with the PlayStation team to launch the PlayStation 2, one of the most successful video game consoles of all time, in 2000, and then the PlayStation Portable in 2005 before becoming SCEA’s chief.

And yes, you can now play as an all-new dragon race, The Dracthyr that is actually a new class as well. These dragons can only be the Evoker class - and only the dragon race can be Evokers. This is a hero class that starts at level 58 with its own starter zone. Check out the cinematic here!


A progression system overhaul and a look at profession systems are on deck for this rollout as well. A completely revamped talent system should offer players more versatility and options. Of note, the UI is also getting a fresh overhaul. These are a lot of significant changes to the core game, even if the new dragon class doesn’t entice you. You can also ride a customizable dragon around for a speedy powerful new traversal option.
Players level up to 70 in this expansion.  An alpha is coming soon, which you can sign up for on the official website. You can discover more about Dragonflight there too!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since its shaky launch, Battlefield 2042 has received dev support in the form of multiple updates that address bugs and adds much-needed content to the game. Earlier this year, a scoreboard detailing ribbon progression, match stats, and more was finally implemented. And while there’s a list of features the community would like to see added to Dice’s frenetic shooter, VOIP (voice over internet protocol) has remained somewhere near the top. In today’s Battlefield 2042’s update, 4.0, limited voice chat options have been introduced.
But what does ”limited” mean? According to the official EA/Battlefield website, there are now “two voice chat channels to choose between: Party and Squad. Settings for VoIP can be adjusted via Options > Sound/Voice > Chat while in-game.” Sadly, you won’t be able to communicate with your whole team just yet, but this is definitely a solid start. Moreover, a Scoreboard UI refresh hit 2042 servers. Finally, a ton of weapon attachements, matchmaking/social, progression//unlocks, maps, and player character changes have been made for a more streamlined action experience. You can read through the extensive amount of fixes here.

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/04/19/sega-reportedly-developing-big-budget-reboots-of-crazy-taxi-jet-set-radio"/>
        <updated>2022-04-19T13:42:11.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new report from Bloomberg states that Sega is developing big-budget reboots of two of its most popular Dreamcast games: Crazy Taxi and Jet Set Radio. 
According to the Bloomberg report, which cites “people familiar with its [Sega’s] plans,” Sega is developing these reboots looking to tap into its back catalog in search of a hit like Fortnite. These two reboots could be the first of Sega’s Super Game initiatives that it announced last November. 
This begs the question: why is Sega looking to Crazy Taxi and Jet Set Radio to be a Fortnite? Fortnite is a battle royale with plenty of crossover opportunities thanks to its live events and multitudes of outfits, and it’s free, which certainly lends to its popularity. Crazy Taxi and Jet Set Radio are decidedly not like Fortnite, but perhaps Sega has more drastic plans for these reboots. Bloomberg also reports that Sega’s European studio is working on a first-person Super Game, so maybe that is the title Sega hopes to become its own Fortnite-like hit. 
The Crazy Taxi reboot has been in development for more than a year, and Sega plans to release it in the next two to three years. Jet Set Radio is also early in development, and the publication’s sources say both games could still be canceled. 
For the uninitiated, Crazy Taxis is a zany quasi-racing title where players are tasked with transporting passengers across town in a high-speed taxi, all while tracks from The Offspring (and others) play. On the other hand, Jet Set Radio is a game about rollerblading and graffiti, with flashy visuals in an area not unlike the shopping districts of Tokyo and a soundtrack that rips.
Both Crazy Taxi and Jet Set Radio are beloved by their fans, so here’s hoping these reboots come to fruition as games we can all play one day.

As of today, PS5 and PS4 owners can take on all kinds of Lego building challenges in this relaxing puzzler from Light Brick Studio. The PlayStation 5 version has updated visuals compared to the last-gen machines, offering ray tracing like its Xbox Series X counterpart. New to the game is Creative Mode, which allows players to make their "most imaginative builds" a reality. According to a press release shared with Game Informer, this mode starts players out with a curated set of bricks to "create models and scenes, with virtually endless build plates to build upon." Outside of Creative Mode, the game includes its original single-player puzzles nestled within a story of a parent and child learning the importance of playing together.
Lego Builder's Journey is running out of platforms to release on, and it can now be played on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, Xbox One, Switch, PC, and iOS. You can read our review of it right here. 

Lego Builder's Journey recently made its way onto our top 10 list of Lego games. Check out its placement, and see where your favorite Lego game stacks up here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It gets easier every day to find out which games will simply run on a Steam Deck; the list of Steam Verified-rated games is regularly extending, and SteamDB are keeping track of Playable and Unsupported games as well. Still, while these may be old favourites that you’ve already sunk hours into on a desktop, you might still be wondering how these games play when transplanted to the smaller screen and gamepad-ish controls of a handheld. 


Liam was wondering it, anyway. Thus, he picked ten difference game genres from the most-played on Steam, asked me to play at least one game that would broadly represent each, and report back on which are the most (and least) suited to life on the Steam Deck.

Kolstad has the upcoming fourth John Wick slated for 2023 and also wrote the 2021 action film Nobody starring Bob Odenkirk.

In other words, a game that doesn’t have enough simulation to be a sim, action to be an action title, puzzle-solving to be a puzzle game, and… you get the idea. Despite the nebulous classification, games in this genre are unambiguously incredible experiences, often exploring refreshing and fascinating concepts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Atlus has announced a landmark sales figure for its latest Shin Megami Tensei game on Switch, boasting a new seven-figure total for copies sold. Shin Megami Tensei V has officially sold over one million units worldwide. 
The news came from a tweet on the Altus_West Twitter account, dropping the monumental amount of sales for the exclusive Switch JRPG. The tweet only says the one million figure represents total worldwide sales but doesn't break down the number into units sold for each region. 
Shin Megami Tensei V has sold 1 million units worldwide! ✨

Also embedded within the tweet, which you can see above, is a piece of art depicting the main character from SMTV drawn by character designer Masayuki Doi as a thank you to fans who purchased the game.
The turn of the year brought news of SMTV climbing to the top of the series' sales charts when Atlus claimed it had sold 800,000 copies, and it has only been steadily selling since. The previous entry, 2014's Shin Megami Tensei IV on 3DS, sold upwards of 600,000 copies, an impressive number for a franchise that hasn't quite hit the mainstream yet. On the other hand, SMTV still has a little way to go to catch up with the latest Shin Megami Tensei spinoff, Persona 5 Royal, which has sold more than 1.8 million copies worldwide, according to a story from Gematsu from last June.
Shin Megami Tensei V tells the tale of a modern-day student in Tokyo that's transported to an apocalyptic alternate reality and finds themselves wrapped up in a war between angels and demons. Read our review if you'd like to learn more about SMT V and see if it'll be your cup of tea.]]></summary>

For others, it’s a virtual workspace or a digital version of the world we already live in. The most commonly accepted version of the metaverse, though, is something that resembles Ready Player One where all of your favorite characters, friends, and family members interact with each other in a 3D virtual world. Or at least, that’s the most idealized vision of what the metaverse could be.
Of course, that’s not a reality at the moment and the closest something’s come might be Epic’s juggernaut free-to-play battle royale game, Fortnite. But long-running MMOs like CCP Games’ EVE Online might be just as close to what the metaverse may become:…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On paper, Panic's Playdate doesn't have a lot to do with PC. It's a standalone handheld console that fits into the palm of your hand (yes, even palms as small as mine), and is controlled via a d-pad, two face buttons and its unique, standout feature, the crank. But inside this dinky yellow wafer, the spirit of PC gaming has never been stronger. It's there in its eclectic first season of indie games, a series of 24 titles that not only delight in the minutiae of its hardware but are delivered weekly for free in batches of two direct to your console over Wi-Fi. It's there in the openness of the Playdate ecosystem, too, where you can make your own Playdate games in its browser-based Pulp creation tool, download the source code, share it with friends (or sell it) and sideload it onto your Playdate all in a matter of minutes. Heck, Panic have even added the ability to stream from it, capture video and screenshots from it, and hook it up to an external monitor, keyboard or controller via its Playdate Mirror app.
It's a surprisingly versatile bit of kit, the Playdate, and one I feel will enchant and enthral anyone who has a deep and inherent love of all things games. Sure, there's every possibility it may end up as another Ouya-style disaster show, but if you've ever longed for something like Lexaloffle's Pico-8 platform to be more than just a 'fantasy console', then the Playdate is exactly what you've been waiting for.

Playdate is a retro-inspired indie handheld built entirely to deliver novel experiences in a pocket-friendly format. From its bright and friendly appearance to its often whimsical games, it's clear the Playdate's name was chosen with purpose. Like a meet-up between childhood friends, this is an experience meant to recall youth and simplicity. It aims to delight those who pick it up through an array of small, entertaining activities.
The Playdate makes an excellent first impression. The charming yellow handheld may be tiny, but it feels solid in hand. The buttons feel clicky and respo…]]></summary>

As fans wait with bated breath for its release, Konami has revealed a physical collector’s box to further appeal to the Turtles diehard in you. 
Beginning today, you can pre-order a limited-run box that contains some one-of-a-kind goodies (which are pictured above). For $149.99 you'll get the following items:
Physical copy of the game with original box design by TMNT co-creator Kevin Eastman 
Cloth poster featuring Kevin Eastman’s adaptation of TMNT: Turtles in Time (16” x 24”)
Multi-layer acrylic diorama of Leonardo, Donatello, Raphael and Michelangelo (4.5” x 5”)
Enamel pin set of five classic designs – The Technodrome, Turtle Blimp, Party Wagon, Shredder and Krang
Set of 12 translucent comic style character trading cards based on TMNT: Tournament Fighters with rarely seen appearances from Wingnut, Armaggon, Chrome Dome, War, Aska, Karai and more (3” x 5”)
Full-color artbook with 180 pages featuring a chapter dedicated to each of the 13 games in the compilation (5.5” x 8”)
Although the Cowabunga Collection is also coming to PC, this physical collector’s set is only available for the console versions of the game. That would be PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Switch.
We've only seen this edition available for purchase at Target at the time of publishing, but keep an eye out on other retailers and online stores throughout the day as their product pages are updated.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Marvel Studios has released an official teaser trailer for Thor: Love and Thunder. 
This trailer comes just months before this sequel, which is directed by Thor: Ragnarok director Taika Waititi, hits theaters. With the release of this trailer, Thor: Love and Thunder now holds the record for the shortest amount of time between a Marvel Cinematic Universe movie's first trailer and its release in theaters. It's hard to complain, though, because while we did have to wait a while for this trailer, now, seeing how great it looks, it's nice knowing we only have to wait a few months to actually see the movie. 
You can watch the official teaser trailer for Thor: Love and Thunder below:


As you can see in the trailer above, there's not much going on story-wise, especially when you consider we already know a lot about what the movie's going to cover i.e. Gorr the God Butcher as the villain, Jane Foster as The Mighty Thor, and more. In fact, Gorr isn't mentioned once in the trailer and we only get a few quick seconds of Jane as Thor right at the end of the teaser. 
However, despite that, we do get plenty on the whereabouts of Thor and where he's at mentally following the events of Avengers: Endgame, which is where we last saw him. As expected, he's put in some work to get back to his more cut physique (here's hoping we get an amazing workout montage set to some '80s music) and he's rolling with the Guardians of the Galaxy (this is also our first look at this team since Endgame). 
As for where Thor's at mentally, he seems less inclined on partying and fighting, and more about taking in the life around him and ultimately, living a peaceful and tranquil existence. 
To accompany today's teaser trailer, Marvel Studios has also released a new Thor: Love and Thunder poster, which you can view below: 
Thor: Love and Thunder hits theaters July 8.

As for why, the studio said it was moving the upgrade’s development in-house and evaluating the scope of the update. However, many took “until further notice” as a not-so-great sign that the update was in trouble, especially in light of CDPR revealing that it’s no longer using an outside studio to handle the update and instead doing it in-house. Some reports referred to the delay as an “indefinite delay,” which often comes with the implication of “development hell.” 
In a new investors call, though, CDPR senior vice president of business development Michał Nowakowski explained that the delay is not in …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Congratulations, you made it halfway through the month of April in the year 2022 AD, and there's still plenty of year to go around. This week on Game Informer was an exciting one, as we announced our grooviest issue so far featuring Evil Dead: The Game on the cover, we exclusively previewed a new Magic card, ranked the top 10 Lego games, and our very own Jason Guisao reviewed the wonderful new adventure game, Norco. Next week is looking to be just as exciting, if not more. But before we get to next week, we have an entire weekend to enjoy! Here's how the Game Informer staff is looking to spend the next couple of days:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last week on the Halo series, we saw Master Chief and Kwan headed off to their respective homes to seek some sort of resolution to both their problems. But were our heroes victorious in their respective paths? Join us on The Game Informer Show as we review "Homecoming," the fourth episode in the Paramount Plus show, and let you know if it continues to build on the success of the previous episode.


Your regular hosts are back for another round of hilarity and analysis that you've come to expect from GI's review of the Halo series. Alex Stadnik, Andrew Reiner, and Brian Shea are breaking down this week's episode and have a lot to say about another step back for a series that includes some of the most iconic characters in video games.
We start the episode with the promise of answers to what's going on with John's memories and the artifact that somehow connects to what we can presume is one of the Halo rings. Those answers come at the end of the episode, but "Homecoming" spends far too much time drawing out those scenes, continuing the series' trend of poor pacing. On top of that, we finally find ourselves on Madrigal with Soren and Kwan, which continues to feel like a distraction from the main story we care about.
There are some positive aspects of episode four, though. Kai has followed John's lead and gone rogue by removing her emotions-blocking pellet and starts to see the world a bit differently. Her interactions with Miranda Keyes and the rest of the Spartans provide some levity and clarity and prove there is hope for the series yet.
What do you think about Halo thus far? Be sure to let us know in the comments below. We'd also love your feedback on the extra GI Show episodes. Do you like them? Do you want to see us focus on games or the Marvel shows in the future? Please email us at podcast@gameinformer.com or reach out on Discord as we want to know what you think.]]></summary>

No More Heroes 3 will be coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC, according to a tweet from Xseed Games. An image embedded with the announcement shows off what looks to be collector's editions for the console versions. Included with these expanded editions are a CD labeled "musical selections" from No More Heroes 3, a Santa Destroy "MOE~" vanity license plate, and an art book.

April 15, 2022
I had the honor of reviewing No More Heroes 3's Switch release, and while I loved the combat and a lot of the humor, the performance, resolution, and overall drabness of the open world brought the experience down. Here's hoping that the game can benefit greatly when transitioning to more powerful hardware and maybe even throwing in some extras knobs to turn for the PC crowd. I gave No More Heroes 3 a 7.75 out of 10 on the Game Informer scale. Here's an excerpt to get a taste of what's in store if you dive into NMH3:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's strange now to think that, until May 2020, there were no Dread X games. Indie publishers DreadXP have become so synonymous with tightly curated, intriguing horror experiences that it's hard to believe the original demo anthology that kickstarted that reputation is only approaching its second anniversary.
Regular RPS readers may already be aware that (a) I'm a huge horror nerd, and (b) I think the games published under the DreadXP banner are something pretty special. I was equal parts grossed out and charmed by the Lovecraftian dating sim Sucker For Love: First Date when I reviewed it back in January, and was pleasantly surprised by my time with the My Friendly Neighborhood demo at the recent Steam Next Fest. So when I was offered the opportunity to interview Ted Hentschke, Head of Productions at DreadXP, as part of a digital event at last month's GDC, you can hardly blame me for jumping at the chance.

I'm here driving the RPS bus alone, nobody to stop me as I careen down the motorway screaming and trying to slam on the brakes. But I can't, because a golf ball has rolled under the pedal!
You ride this bus long enough, you see games move in cycles similar to fashion designers, or those big ferris wheels at fairgrounds. Things come round, they peak, they go round again. Often a few different people independently notice an empty niche and start working on something to fill it, so you get a bunch of games with similar themes or styles coming out within months of each other. So I ask: why and/or how have a bunch of people identified golf as a gap in the market?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We've covered quite a few graphics card deals for the UK market over the past couple of weeks, as nature slowly heals, but now it's time for the Americans to have a go. Right now Newegg are offering an EVGA RTX 3080 FTW3 Ultra for $999, a $300 reduction from MSRP. 
That's a great deal, with the card costing less than any RTX 3080 I could find on Amazon, and it's from EVGA - widely considered to be among the most-trusted graphics cards brands out there, if not the best.

That's not necessarily the case with the official licensed Dark Souls pen & paper RPG, which seems a touch sloppy. Along with giving one class starter gear it won't have the stats use, it has some spells and items which, going by the rules, seem unhelpful at best. The real Dark Souls starts here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The downwards march in graphics card prices continues - oh, how I've longed to write those words! After posting a deal that had the Nvidia Founders Edition RTX 3080 Ti at its UK RRP of £1049 last week, third-party cards are now reaching the same levels. Right now, you can pick up a beefy KFA2 OC card for the same price, after a £50 discount at Overclockers. 
If you'd prefer the better value RTX 3080, then there's also been movement - after appearing for £860 seven days ago, the cheapest card is now this Zotac Trinity OC model for £810. That's still a hefty chunk of change for a graphics card - and above the original RRP of £650 - but it's a damned sight better than the £1000+ these GPUs have retailed at for months.

I’m a real sucker for verticality, so normally I’d be immediately trying to see how high I could get, but after tentatively scaling a few floors I decided to give the urgent main quest the benefit of the doubt. There would probably just be a disappointing invisible wall anyway. I climbed back down and did my best to engage with the expensive cutscenes filled with proper actors. 50 hours of mediocre Strange Days references later, I had most of the game under my belt and was ready to go searching for something more substantial - to try to find some actual cyberpunk in this retrowave moodboard. I set about pushing Cyberpunk 2077 to the vertical limit.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Of the four hulking Grey Knights under my command, teleporty sword boy was undoubtedly my favourite. Once every turn he could blink across the map, moving twice as far as he can with a regular action point, plopping him right behind a pesky Cultist’s cone of suppressing fire. It was both effective and efficient, but the real fireworks began whenever I clicked teleport strike, which repositioned him while also savaging several enemies in sequence with his power sword. He was simultaneously my initiator and my (almost) one-man clean up crew, ready to be rallied by a cry from my Justicar whenever his AP tank ran empty. I almost felt sorry for the cultists. 
I’ve played a curated, two hour slice of Warhammer 40K: Chaos Gate - Daemonhunters, and I’m keen to play more. As speedy as my sword boy felt in those moments, though, at other times I felt compelled to move forward at a crawl. When I asked creative director Noah Decter-Jackson whether I was just being too cowardly, he hedged his bets.

This process is, currently, one in suspended animation, and has been for longer than I anticipated. I moved just before the release and my PC is still somewhere in or about the Irish Sea. Luckily I can link this to FixFox thematically, as a big exciting incident for the story involves waking up a man who was stuck in a cryopod. Around that, you, a fox called Vix, fix things in a post-apocalyptic sci-fi future where your tools are bananas and stamps.
I was several hours into FixFox before I left it, and discovered it was much larger than I expected. It's paradoxically cosy and friendly even as its world is vast and strange. I had some minor annoyances with this - you do a lot of travelling around, and in the early stages of the game there aren't many fast travel options to mitigate this. But now I've been without it for two weeks, I've found myself missing the big spaces and warm welcomes of that world.

That's £20 cheaper than the current Amazon price, and a massive drop from the £430+ going rate at the beginning of the year.
*OK, the Ryzen 9 5950X is technically faster, but it costs way more and the difference in gaming performance is miniscule. The Ryzen 7 5800X3D also looks promising, but hasn't yet been released and will likely cost more than this 5900X while packing fewer cores.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Even with PC hardware orthodoxy supporting SSD replacement, I’m convinced that getting one of the best microSD cards for the Steam Deck is the wiser method of expanding its storage. It’s technically possible to swap in a bigger SSD, sure, but compatible M.2 2230 drives are much harder to find than the standard 2280 drives on our best gaming SSDs list – and based on my testing, a good microSD card can be just about as fast as the Deck’s preinstalled SSD.


That’s on top of microSD cards being cheaper, easier to install, easier to remove, and available with much more choice than Steam Deck-compatible SSDs. That’s not to say that any old card will work – Valve’s handheld PC specifically supports UHS-1 microSD cards – but I’ve found and tested a few that will do the job, and do it well.

It keeps things simple and it largely works, making for a game that's an inoffensive 8-bit-style romp with flashes of greatness.

One thing I've been playing recently is Ghostwire: Tokyo, a ghost huntin' action game that's a bit less weird and a bit more "kind of like an Ubisoft game" than I was expecting. But I like Ubisoft games just fine, so I'm having a blast - plus there are still some clutch ghost fights to be hand when I run out of finger-ammo for my magic hands.
I am extra delighted by the animals, though. For whatever reason, they are unaffected by the evil fog that has swept through Tokyo and turned everyone into spirits, so there are a few dogs and cats just sitting around and (and this is the good bit) you can read their thoughts.

Annihilation is a good mood to channel. I hope the third-person explore-o-melee game does turn out a bit like that when it arrives in 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Corsair 7000D Airflow hasn't been reviewed here at RPS, but I've brought it up today for two reasons: because it's heavily discounted over at Amazon UK, and because it's a case I've been using to house my main PC for the past six months. I've become a big fan of it in that time - it's spacious, easy to build in, cool and clean - and the only real downside is the price.
The case debuted late last year for a princely £240, expensive even for a large form factor case, but now it's down to £175 - a more reasonable ask given its full tower size and laundry list of features, which I'll tell you about presently.

If you want, WordleBot can analyse your guesses and figure out how optimally you played at each step. Backed up by numbers, it'll explain your good plays and, if you're me, make you feel a bit daft for some of the bad plays.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some of Intel’s 12th Gen Alder Lake processors are among the best gaming CPUs you can buy, but certain owners have noticed a seemingly worrisome trend: their LGA 1700 motherboard socket puts so much pressure on the chip that its IHS (integrated heat spreader, the big grey bit on top) starts to bend. This isn’t so much a concern for the CPU’s structural integrity as it is a cooling issue, as a non-flat IHS will struggle to transfer heat to the CPU cooler plate as effectivity.


In a statement to Tom’s Hardware, however, an Intel spokesperson has essentially said it’s not as bad as it sounds. The statement does acknowledge the warping (or “deflection”, to use Intel’s more engineer-y term), but says there’s no evidence thus far to suggest it drives load temperatures up to unsafe levels.

I am mildly distressed to see KH4 lean towards a 'realistic' art style in parts, though I would be curious to see a Kingdom Hearts Mickey Mouse that's just a wee mouse wrapped in leather, plaid, buckles, and zips. While KH4 is largely a mystery for now, eagle-eyed viewers think the announcement trailer hints at a crossover with the Disney Princess world of Star Wars.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[2D bullet hell game Vampire Survivors is surely one of the most interesting success stories of the year, as what was a simple mobile game became popular almost overnight. Its very minimalistic roguelike style captured players looking for something casual, but still engrossing. You pick one of several characters and move them around the screen as they auto-attack. As enemies are disposed of the player levels up, along with changing weapons and gaining power-ups, with the ultimate goal being to keep the ever growing mob of enemies under control. On death you unlock new weapons and characters by spending coins gained in battle.


While the game currently sits on Steam with an “overwhelmingly popular” based on almost 70k reviews, success is definitely not what solo developer Luca Galante was expecting when he first started working on it.

The Nvidia GeForce RTX 3050 and AMD Radeon RX 6500 XT both launched in recent weeks with the aim of reasserting some sanity, and to an extent, they have: while they’re not immune to bonkers inflation, they’re still relatively affordable, with unusually plentiful stock available.


Which, though, is the better buy? Both are 1080p-focused cards on sale for £300 or less, both sit at the bottom of their respective GPU hierarchies (the RTX 30 series and Radeon RX 6000 series), and both support ray tracing, so let’s break out the bar chart app and do some comparisons.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Medieval city builders that pit you against enormous waves of enemies are clearly having a bit of a moment right now. In the last few months alone, we’ve endured the cursed nights of Age Of Darkness: Final Stand, called down sky lasers on the hordes of Diplomacy Is Not An Option, and now we’ve got ORX, a dark fantasy tower defence game that blows all of them out of their ditch water moats with its compelling mix of deckbuilding and real-time strategy. It’s not out in full just yet, but its demo got a substantial update this week, adding more levels and a bunch of game-changing cards to the mix that are well worth making a return trip for if you’ve only ever played the original half-hour version from 2020. I’ve lost several evenings to it already, and lemme tall ya, RTS turtlers have never had it so good.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When we were putting together our most anticipated games of 2022 list back in January, there was one game I knew had to be on it: Mojiken Studio’s A Space For The Unbound. It’s a slice of life adventure about two Indonesian high school students set in the late 90s, and the demo (which has recently been expanded to include the first chapter in addition to its short prologue) instantly captivated me when I first played it a couple of years ago. There are some light supernatural elements that will be instantly familiar to anyone who’s watched the films of Japanese anime directors Makoto Shinkai and Mamoru Hosoda (including a giant, ominous Your Name-style comet, no less), but for the most part this is a much more grounded game than Mojiken have made in the past, such as the fantastical point and click puzzlers She And The Light Bearer and When The Past Was Around. 
Indeed, the only game in their back catalogue that has a recognisable, real-life setting is their short, free browser game Banyu Lintar Angin. Born out of an internal game jam project in 2017, Banyu Lintar Angin once again draws inspiration from the studio’s home country of Indonesia. It only takes a couple of minutes to play, but speaking with its creator Dimas Novan, it was vital in sowing the seeds for what A Space For The Unbound would eventually become.

Therefore, it's extremely exciting to see the RTX 3080 available at Laptops Direct for a recent low price of £860, some £100 below the cheapest RTX 3080 card on Amazon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You’d be forgiven for getting excited about the AMD Radeon RX 6500 XT. A brand new RDNA 2 graphics card, with ray tracing support, that’s both easy to find in stock and available at a comparatively approachable £200 / $230? In the midst of a years-long components shortage, exacerbated by all manner of price-gouging bollocks, it’d be entirely understandable if upgrade-starved PC owners went for this like my cat goes for unattended crisp packets. Especially if they’re happy to stick to playing at 1080p.


Alas, the RX 6500 XT isn’t just an inferior low-end option to the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3050 (one of the best graphics cards, and perhaps the outright best for budget builds right now). It’s an offputtingly slow, sometimes bizarrely-designed GPU in general; instead of providing long-overdue relief to a truly fudged hardware market, it ends up feeling like more an attempt to just sell any old second-rate kit to an audience that’s been left desperate for something, anything that’s new and somewhat affordable.
