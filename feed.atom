After progressing through the area, the Fascists will find the tomb and you have to sneak out. However, as you reach the exit, you may not know just how to exit the Catacombs down in the Necropolis in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle.

How to Exit the Catacombs and Open the Gate


Whether you sneak past the Fascists or choose to take them out directly via combat, you'll eventually reach a closed gate with the quest objective to Exit the Catacombs. If you look at your quest marker indicator, it will show that you need to exit via the closed gate, but there's no indication of how to do so. While most locked doors or gates will tell you how to open them when you interact with them—such as saying it's locked from the other side or requires a key—this gate offers no such information.


Look around this room and you will find a big Roman-style head and torso bust of a man wearing a toga. You have probably encountered these in various places and wondered their purpose. Before now, the only use of them has been to slam over someone's head to take them out.


However, to Exit the Catacombs, you need to pick up the bust and place it on the pedestal located to the left of the Catacombs Gate. As long as you pick up the bust and then approach the pedestal, it will give you the option to interact with it to place the bust on top of the pedestal. Putting the bust on the pedestal will open the gate and allow you to finally Exit the Catacombs.

This isn't Indy's first foray into the gaming world, but it's been a decade and a half since the daring archaeologist had a playable adventure.


Now I'll admit, I'm not a diehard Indiana Jones fan. I've seen all the movies, and enjoyed them—yes, even Kingdom of the Crystal Skull—but it's not a franchise I've found myself rewatching many times over the years like Lucasfilm's other IP Star Wars. However, I am a huge fan of Wolfenstein and therefore developer MachineGames.

Developer Summitsphere has announced that its upcoming Wario Land-inspired platformer Antonblast will be further delayed on the Nintendo Switch.
Although the game is still scheduled to launch on Steam on 3rd December 2024, it's been determined that the Nintendo Switch version simply isn't quite up to scratch. In a social media announcement, director Tony Grayson said "We need more time to make sure that this version of the game is running at peak performance and meeting our own high standards, as well as Nintendo's".

Not only is this very generous of them, but it also unlocks the photo mode in-game, which is undeniably brilliant.

Still, it’s not often we see psychological horror combined with ultraviolence, and anything that gives off even a whiff of Condemned: Criminal Origins has my attention.
Total Chaos started life as a popular Doom 2 mod, and while I dare the say the limitations of that game sell the atmosphere a little better than this much sleeker update, I certainly trust Trigger Happy enough to make the most of the new engine. The game is set in New Oasis, a “once bustling haven for coal miners” that is now most definitely not bustling, nor haven-like.

In a standard Zombies fashion, the game doesn't tell you what to do with it. But don't worry; we're here to explain what the Stamp does in BO6 Zombies and how to get it.


How to get and use Stamps in BO6 Zombies


You can get Stamps by shooting a zombie with a bucket on its head around or after Round 10. Mine appeared near the Dead Shot Daquiri building, but it does spawn in random places, too. After you've acquired the Stamp, use it on the knights to claim a sword. This is tied to the build for the elemental swords, the newest Wonder Weapon featured in Citadelle de Morts. 


Screenshot by Destructoid


You can find four knights in the top-right room inside the castle, specifically at coordinates F1. 


Screenshot by Destructoid


Each Knight corresponds to the element it harnesses, featuring a symbol on the statue. For example, you can spot a lion on a Knight, indicating that it's designated for the Solaris: Lion of Light builds. Here's a look into what each statue gives you:


Screenshot by Destructoid


When you approach the statue, simply press the Interact button (same as Reload) next to the Knight, and you'll get a Bastard Sword. It'll replace your Melee Weapon, allowing you to slice up zombies.

However, if you're looking for the elemental sword, you'll need to buff this bad boy out to unlock its hidden powers. There are also different steps to unlock each one, including Dragon's Fire, Stag of Storms, Raven's Shadow, and Lion of Light. The procedure functions similarly to Zombies Origins' Fire, Lightning, Ice, and Wind Staffs. For more information on the BO6 Zombies sword upgrades, check out our elemental sword guide.

It’s certainly a game that sounds interesting on paper. So, it’s been stuck in the back of my mind for decades, but I never really made the move to play it.


Why would I? I hadn’t watched the movie, and reviews at the time of launch were lukewarm. I knew it developed something of a cult following since then, but even among fans, I heard the same thing: The whole psychological element was too ambitious and didn’t actually work very well. I’ve been left to imagine its failings.


But I rarely miss a remaster from Nightdive Studios, and since they’ve taken on the task of polishing up The Thing, then the stars have certainly aligned. I even went and watched the movie while runnin…]]></summary>

The Thing: Remastered is an update of the 2002 game, The Thing, which is based off the 1982 film, The Thing. The game is set up as a sequel to the movie, taking place just shortly after the story of the film ends. It involves an antarctic research team dealing with a shapeshifting, people-cloning alien that has infiltrated their ranks. It’s tense and concise. And it’s really good!

To locate the elemental swords in Black Ops 6 Zombies, you must acquire a Stamp first for its base version (Bastard Sword).

The Thing: Remastered is an ultra-sharp and commendably playable update to a game that history will remember as ‘actually a pretty good pick at Choices when you really just popped in to get some Revels but got embarrassed when the till staffer said “is that everything?” in a tone that could have been neutral but equally could have been a damning indictment of your character’.
I’m being slightly facetious here, of course. History actually remembers Computer Artworks’s 2002 shooty horror game for how incredibly ambitious and conceptually inventive its proto-sus social squad system was. In homage to the body-snatching alien paranoia of Carpenter’s 1982 horror classic, The Thing tasks you with not just assembling and directing a squad, but keeping them from breaking down or turning on you - in fear you might be hosting the titular molecular stowaway.

Nightdive Studios' The Thing: Remastered has been sitting on a 2024 release date for a while now, and while a post from the developer yesterday confirmed that it will definitely be coming in December (it is the last month of the year, after all), an Xbox Wire line-up might have given us an even more specific date (thanks to our pals at Pure Xbox for the heads up).
Titled 'Next Week on Xbox: New Games for December 2 to 6', the Xbox Wire post lists Nightdive's remaster with a 5th December release date for Microsoft's latest consoles and Game Pass. Now, this is yet to be confirmed by the developer and there's obviously no guarantee that the Switch version will arrive on the same day, but this certainly seems like a real possibility.

It is a house made of house. You’ll actually design the layout yourself every time you wander through it, picking from a selection of mismatched room types whenever you open a door.

Pokemon started as a role-playing game on the Gameboy in 1996 with the physical trading card game launching later in the same year. Nearly 30 years later, millions of people still collect the original cards. Rare examples make headlines for the staggering values they achieve at auction.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Limestone is a critical material you need to obtain to get Midhaven up and running in Towers of Aghasba, but getting it isn't exactly obvious. So, here's where you can find all the Limestone you need.


How to get Limestone in Towers of Aghasba


One of the first objectives you're given upon reaching Midhaven is to build a Lumber Mill within the village limits. You're required to acquire several standard materials for the Lumber Mill, but one of the main materials, Limestone, is a mystery if you're just getting to this point in the game.


If you take a look at the location hint in-game, the tooltip states that you can find Limestone around mountains and cliffs but gives no other relevant information. I had trouble finding this material myself, mainly because I wasn't sure what I was looking for. Turns out, it is the next tier of Stone in Towers of Aghasba, and that means that it comes from a specific type of boulder: a Limestone Boulder.

Limestone Boulders look very similar to normal Boulders, but, when harvested, yield various amounts of Limestone for crafting. They cannot be found on Amani Island like regular Stone. Instead, they is quite prevalent around the mainland of Aghasba. There is some relevant truth in the tooltip's explanation as Limestone is indeed most common around cliffs. My go-to spot for the material is located Southeast of Midhaven, near the Teleporter in the area.

Although Limestone is a higher-tier version of Stone, it does not require a higher-tier tool to harvest. As long as you have a Stone Pickaxe or better in your Inventory, you can harvest as much of the material as you need. High-quality tools will make mining it in bulk easier, but you can still get by with the bear minimal in a pinch.

It is, of course, very punk of me to recognise this. However, this hasn’t stopped every other videogame released in the last 74 years trying to coin their own punk subgenre. The latest to do so is ‘brinepunk’ FPS Abyssus, which seems to have mostly arrived at the terms by being ‘a bit Steampunk, but underwater’. Abyssus looks cool, and so with the power vested in me by the Greggs vegan sausage roll I had for lunch today, I hereby declare that this is the last game allowed to do this. Let’s see if it’s making the most of it, at least.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blaze Entertainment and its Evercade brand have teamed up with various developers and publishers over the years, from Bandai Namco to Jaleco and beyond. Next up is a partnership with SNK, with products from the Neo Geo lineup planned throughout 2025 and 2026. 


As for what those products are, specific titles have yet to be announced. We can certainly imagine the multi-game carts that might be in the works for the Evercade platform, though. So far, Blaze simply says that "licensed retro gaming products and physical cartridge releases" are in the works. 


Here's the announcement in teaser trailer form:




Hardware mentioned in the PR includes Evercade EXP-R, VS-R, Alpha bartop arcade machines, and the HyperMegaTech branded Super Pocket devices. Look, I'm not asking for much, but it wouldn't hurt to slap a Metal Slug collection on a humble little Evercade cart, would it? Let's make it happen. 


The first licensed SNK Neo Geo products are penciled in for some time in 2025. A special showcase video will kick things off with a look at the lineup, release dates, and pre-order info in Q1 2025. "This partnership isn't just about adding great games; it's about celebrating the artistry and legacy of NEOGEO in a way that's accessible to fans old and new," said Blaze Entertainment CEO Andrew Byatt. "We’re thrilled to give these classics a new platform in 2025."


Evercade has been pretty good about steadily releasing new cartridges. The latest include the Legacy of Kain collection, a second Data East Arcade cart, a two-pack of Metal Dragon and Life on Mars, and two more dips into the Toaplan Arcade bucket.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Winter Holiday Sale 2024 is rumored for an upcoming appearance on the Epic Games Store if the social media rumors are to be believed.


The latest rumor comes from reliable leaker Bili-Bili, who posted the information on their X account. The holiday sale has become a tradition on Epic, which puts some massive discounts on thousands of games. So far, the gaming giant has remained tight-lipped about when the sale will go live and what games will feature on it.


Epic Games Store Winter Holiday Sale 2024 expected release date


Typically, winter holiday sales on the Epic Games Store have taken place before the Christmas period, and the latest rumor hints at something similar happening this year. According to the latest rumors, the sales will go live on or around December 12.


That said, the dates are ultimately decided by Epic themselves, and it's best to wait till the official information regarding the final date is available. It's safe to expect a few promotions along the way as well before the holiday sales go live this year.




Will Epic Games Store Winter Holiday Sale 2024 have giveaways?


Like the last few years, it's safe to expect 12 days of giveaways once again, offering a free game each day. All you need to do is to have an Epic account and check out the website daily.


Typically, Epic offers a wide range of games in its giveaways, from AAA releases to niche indie offerings. Whatever the case might be, they're all free, and as long as you add them to your in-game library, the items will stay there forever.


It will be exciting to find out what Epic has in store for all of us this year. 2024 has been a huge year for gaming itself, and there's a chance of finding a few of those titles as potential freebies. If not, having a great discount will be perfect for those who might have been thinking about playing those titles.

        <updated>2024-12-05T20:25:07.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lapislazuli is a common resource that you can mine in Enshrouded. It looks like an ocean blue rock carved out from a bigger rock. It might seem common in rarity, but it doesn’t show until you have progressed deeply in the game. To help you with that, here is a comprehensive guide on how you can find Lapislazuli in Enshrouded.


How to get Lapislazuli in Enshrouded


You can get Lapislazuli in Kindlewastes and Nomad Highlands biomes. But you can’t just pick it as it is since you need a pickaxe to mine it. To reach this area, go to the Vukah Cave Passage and keep moving south till you see a cliff. 


Once you reach the cliff, you have to look at bone-structured rocks. Once you spot them, glide down, and you will see clusters of Lapislazuli lying at that place.


Where to use Lapislazuli in Enshrouded?


You can use Lapislazuli to craft several items like Iron Bench, Palm Wood Table, and more in the game. You can craft it with the help of Alchemist, Hunter, etc. Here is the list of all items:


Item
Lapislazuli


Archmage Chest
6


Archmage Gloves
2


Archmage Hat
3


Blue Globe
5


Deerstalker Chest
2


Deerstalker Hood
1


Eternal Heal Channel
50


Ethereal Plane
1


Iron Bench
8


Large Palm Wood Cupboard
8


Palm Wood Banquet Table
20


Palm Wood Table
4






Just keep in mind that this isn't the only requirement for crafting the items mentioned above. This simply shows how many Lapislazuli you need to craft them.


You can also use this resource to craft Eternal Spells with the help of the Alchemist. Not only that, it also helps you to strengthen the flame to level six. However, you will need 40 Lapislazuli to do that. It's a good way to explore more areas, as flames can help you travel anywhere within moments.

        <updated>2024-12-05T20:23:03.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Early last month, Monster Hunter Wilds, the newest mainline entry in the long-running series, had an open beta on all platforms to give players an early taste of the action (and the developers some much needed feedback). While the beta was received well, many players agreed on one thing: something about the combat felt.. off. Things were a little limp, and the culprit quickly became apparent: a near total lack of hitstop.


For the uninitiated, "hitstop" is a period of freezeframes that games and animated media employ during a big impact to really sell the weight of the blow. It looks unrealistic, but it's ultra-satisfying when done appropriately, and it's a Monster Hunter staple. 


Image via Capcom


A new interview over at PC Gamer with the game's director, Yuya Tokuda, reveals that the change was ironically the result of us Westerners complaining too much. "Many of the users from overseas commented that the hitstop was way too [intense]," Tokuda said regarding Monster Hunter: World. He expressed relief that players wanted it back, saying the feedback was "very positive." 


Newer previews of the game's latest playable build have already reported vastly improved hitstop, making combat feel weightier and more satisfying. Speaking of combat, some weapons are getting "big changes" ahead of release, those being the Insect Glaive, Switch Axe, Lance, and Sword & Shield. As a lance player who heard less-than-favorable things from the open beta, this makes me very happy.


I wish I could throw my two cents into the opinion well but unfortunately I was out of town during the open beta. From the sound of it, I too would've been disappointed by the floatier feeling combat, but I'm almost glad I was spared that month of gnawing anxiety before learning about these positive changes. Monster Hunter Wilds is shaping up to be a series great, thanks in no small part to the team's enthusiasm for feedback.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Strange Scaffold has recently covered emotional abuse in El Paso, Elsewhere, voyeurism in Life Eater and Clockolding, and violent power fantasy in I Am Your Beast. Given that trend, I would not have guessed their next game would be a turn-based tactical game with Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles licensing.


Uh, yeah, so as part of the PC Game Show, Strange Scaffold has announced Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown, which is exactly as I described: turn-based turtles. “I get to make a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles game where the very first lines of dialogue establish that Shredder and Splinter are dead. Who else can say that?" said Xalavier Nelson Jr. Bummer, dude, but the turtles have met Batman and the Ghostbusters. Can you say that?


Trailer via PC Gamer


That means a new antagonist has the job of harrowing the turtles. That at least means that the enemies don’t have to exclusively be the Foot Clan, but, from what’s shown, it’s just Foot Clan. Also, each level shows off only one turtle on each level, rather than having you control all four of them. That strikes me as a bit weird, but the press release seems to imply that each turtle has their own storyline.


The actual look of the game is very Strange Scaffold, which is to say, low budget and creative with its resources. The characters are shown as small figurines, and the environments are small spaces with psychedelic backgrounds.


Considering the fact that the big-budget games space has now become so expensive that companies will only take a risk on big established licenses, it’s nice to see these sorts of games fall to fans at smaller developers. We still get more cash-grabby licensed games, but at least that’s not the only way.


There’s no announced release date for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown, and thus far, only PC has been announced.

If you, personally, are reading RPS while falling off a mountain at this very moment, I’m afraid I can’t help you. Luckily, if you bonk your head on Steam on the way down, you’ll find a demo for stylish open world climbing game Cairn, which should hopefully distract you from your imminent pancaking.
Cairn is from The Game Bakers, of Furi and Haven fame. We first saw it at the Day Of The Devs this year. I was fresh off the lovely Jusant at the time. “Ah, another relaxing and whimsical French game about mountain climbing!” I thought. I was a fool. It’s far more intense, this one, although there are dashes of Breath Of The Wild and Death Stranding to add some whimsy and wonder to your Sisyphean struggle. Plus, it's very pretty. Here’s some new footage, or possibly some old footage depending on badly the embargo has messed up my schedule.

Chances are you’ve died to it a couple of times and are now seeking some assistance. How exactly do you kill the glowy foe in the Crystal Cave?


A crystal monster in Crystal Cave


Unlike the Blood Zombies, which can't see at all, this new enemy in Enigma of Fear seems to have great eyesight. It's also fast and will pursue you out of the room while generating waves of fear that eventually knock you out and spell game over.


To take out the radiant fiend, you need to perform one extra step than when fighting Blood Zombies. Rather than pressing the Flashlight button to toggle between regular and blue light, hold the button to open a wheel menu. At the top is an option to turn off the flashlight entirely, which you may have overlooked.

Flashlight extinguished, crouch, sneak up behind the monster, and whack it from behind. Be wary, though. Turning off the flashlight makes you less detectable, but you're not invisible. Like with the Blood Zombies, you still need to use some strategy when creeping up.


Whatever happened to Oswald?


When close enough, you’ll get an Interact prompt to knock the glowing guy out. He’ll drop an item, which reveals that this poor thing is what remains of the researcher Oswald Magani, whose name you may have already encountered once or twice.

There are a few other interesting tidbits in the room Oswald was guarding: a couple of lore building items, a letter that provides clues about how to take out Goliath, and a medkit, which you'll probably need by now. Then it’s time to delve further into the Crystal Cave, where you might run into more of Enigma of Fear's corrupted researchers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Minecraft has recently released their most anticipated Pale Garden update. Some of the major features are Pale Garden Biome, Creaking Mob, and Resin. Here are the details of every major feature in the Pale Garden update in Minecraft.


All major features in Pale Garden update in Minecraft




Pale Garden 


Pale Garden is the biggest highlight in this Minecraft update. This is a new biome, which is a variation of the Dark Forest. What’s even better is that you can see a lot of Pale Oaks and Eyeblossoms in this biome. Both Pale Oaks and Eyeblossoms are the new species that is going to debut in this update.


Apart from that, you will also hear new ambient sounds that are specifically for Pale Garden. 


Also, animal mobs will not naturally spawn in this biome. However, you have to be aware of the new monster "Creaking,” which lurks there at night or during thunderstorms.


Creaking Mob


As mentioned before, Creaking Mob is a new monster that will spawn in Pale Garden. It is tough to beat as it does not take any damage when it is naturally spawned. Also, it is resistant to the fire, so the only way to destroy them is to destroy the Creaking Heart, which is controlling this monster. 


The only clue for finding the Creaking Heart is that it is within the radius of 32 blocks from the Creaking mob. So you have to search the surrounding area before daylight hits or the Creaking Mob is not in the radius of 32 blocks.


Resin


This Minecraft update also brings a new resource called Resin, which you can collect in the Pale Garden biome. How can you obtain it? It is very simple; you have to hit the Creaking mob with any kind of weapon. As you do it, the Creaking Heart will drop resins on the ground. You can then use these Resins to build new blocks in the game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For as long as there's been Doom, there's been a way to modify and tinker with id Software's iconic FPS. Indeed, the original has been ported in so many interesting and bizarre ways, including on a smart toothbrush. Did you even know there were smart toothbrushes?


Anyway, the time has come to unleash it unto Stardew Valley. You can see it in action on the Reddit thread below, but it does exactly what it says on the tin by adding an arcade cabinet into the game that will allow you to play the original Doom.




Simply referred to as "DoomValley," you can install it yourself by downloading the file from GitHub. User wojciech-graj provides installation instructions for both Windows and Linux. However, do note that it doesn't work with sound. But you all know what Doom sounds like at this point.


I should have said StarDoom Valley...it was right there!


Based on the above footage, it looks as though you just have to purchase the cabinet from Gus in the Stardrop Saloon. It'll only set you back 10,000 gold, but if you play it the way my girlfriend does, you're all basically millionaires at this point, I'd wager.


Honestly, given that Stardew Valley already has an arcade machine that plays its own minigame, I'm surprised it's taken this long to add Doom into it. Unless there are multiple instances of this happening in the past, I'm just not with the times anymore.


Be that as it may, it still astounds me that Doom keeps getting all this love some 30 years after it was released. Given that we've seen it running on a John Deere tractor, a pregnancy test, and even E. coli cells (sort of), porting it to Stardew almost seems passé at this point.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Moise Kean Serie A POTM SBC is now live in EA FC 25, and you can unlock a special card to add to your Ultimate Team squad. 


Kean has had a brilliant November for his club, which has seen him being voted as the best player in the Serie A. To celebrate his performances, EA Sports has released a new card, which is part of its own SBC. Let's take a look at how you can complete the challenge and if doing so is worth your resources at all. 


EA FC 25 Moise Kean Serie A POTM SBC tasks


The Moise Kean Serie A POTM SBC has two different tasks, and here are their conditions.


Task 1 - Top Form



Min. 1 Players: Team of the Week


Min. Team Rating: 83



Task 2 - Serie A



Min. 1 Players from: Serie A TIM


Min. Team Rating: 85



EA FC 25 Moise Kean Serie A POTM SBC solutions


Here's a set of solutions you can use to complete the latest POTM SBC. 


Task 1 - Top Form



Any 10 83-rated items


Any 82-rated TOTW item



Task 2 - Serie A



Vitinha 85


Alex Remiro 84


Oberdorf 86


Little 86


De Ligt 84


Buchanan 84


Guirassy 84


Marcus Thuram 83


Benzema 86


Grealish 84


Casemiro 84



This POTM SBC has decent value when I analyze the card. The Trivela+ playstyle is always useful if you know how to get the best out of it. It also has the Chip Shot, Rapid, and Power Shot playstyles, and offers 94 Pace and 86 Shooting. 4* Weak Foot is decent as well, but there's a limitation. 


Kean's POTM item only has Poacher++ and no other roles. I am unsure why EA Sports designed the item like that, but it's a limiting factor. If you use a Poached, this item can be a great addition.

It's been years now since Nintendo opened the eShop floodgates and started letting everything in. In stark contrast to the Wii U days when even established developers had trouble getting their games on Nintendo platforms, the weekly update is now filled with games that would have been unthinkable just one console generation ago.
For all my moaning to come, I'll make it clear up front that I'm not advocating going back to those dark days - the breadth and quantity of experiences you can download from the eShop is one of the great strides forward Nintendo made this gen. The problem that needs addressing is one of content management in an overcrowded storefront; for every promising-looking game and genuine gem, there are five cynical, bottom-of-the-barrel releases obscuring it.

That's why I was thrilled to discover someone's created a set of CRT-style overlays for the Steam Deck.


While CRT shaders have existed in some form or another for a while now as part of the ever-popular ReShade injector, getting them to render correctly is a wholly different can of worms. Some of them are also quite the performance hogs, and it's no surprise that they don't work great on low-resolution displays. The Steam Deck's humble 1200x800 screen hasn't worked well with the ones I tried. Now, however, Reddit user Traditional-Ad1708 has taken it upon themselves to fine-tune a number of CRT-style shader…]]></summary>

I don't usually pour too many hours into them since my brain can only handle so much. Yet, my experience with Dungeons of Dreadrock 2: The Dead King's Secret was the complete opposite, as I constantly lost track of time with its many puzzles. I even had to force myself to put it down, with the thought of "just one more puzzle" lingering in my mind. 


DoD2 continues off from the original narrative, featuring the same retro-inspired art style. I'm new to the series, but understanding its storyline wasn't too much of a stretch. It's your classic adventure where the hero, aka the sorceress, ventures into a treacherous place to find the Crown of Wisdom.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of my favourite anime shows is Sakura Quest. It's the story of an unemployed lady from Tokyo who accidentally gets herself appointed "Queen" of a struggling backwater village by the regional tourist board. From that case of mistaken identity proceeds 25 whole-ass episodes of Machiavellian haggling with crusty bigwigs over things like organising a concert. It's playfully dull, heartily mundane entertainment. No supernatural flourishes here - just the magic of paperwork and the thrill of bureaucracy.


I'm reminded of Sakura Quest by Danchi Days, a forthcoming cosy adventure with irresponsibly enticing Game Boy Advance-style visuals. It casts you as Hoshino, a teenage girl who's just moved to an old "danchi" housing complex and is trying to revive the yearly tradition of a summer festival. How will she do this? By means of haggling - haggling, and a bit of CSI.

With crops to be planted, cattle to be raised and NPCs to be wooed, the farm sim trappings are loud and clear. But this one also packs in explorable mines, bandits, and hunting to beef (pun absolutely intended) things up.

I'd just missed the really big part - the fact it's a pacifistic Genshin Impact wearing a pretty dress. And as that realisation sunk in for the first time, my heart also sank with it. I really tried, I mean really tried to get into Nikki's gacha offerings; to delight in its menagerie of menus and cash in countless currencies for fun socks or glitzy tiaras. Sadly, I won't be logging back in ever again.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Come at the king, you best not miss.
It’s safe to say that, 146 million sales later, Nintendo’s risk of launching a dockable handheld console in 2017 has paid off handsomely. After all, Sony’s PS Vita was all but dead by that point, and despite the 3DS managing to reverse its fortunes after a swift price drop in its first year, many claimed that the rise of mobile gaming would spell the end of handheld consoles.
Yet the Switch proved the naysayers wrong and, if anything, ignited a renewed interest in handhelds the likes of which we haven’t seen in years. Mobile gaming has fallen by the wayside (somewhat - though Nintendo properties have also dipped their toes in the water here), and, we now have a bevvy of powerful handheld consoles to choose from, including the Steam Deck, the Asus ROG Ally X, the Lenovo Legion Go, and many more. Yet despite the growing competition, the Switch has comfortably maintained its position as the king of handheld gaming in 2024.

Civilization VII is just a few months away from launch — we still have to pinch ourselves when saying that — and as you might expect, the success of Civilization VI on Switch has influenced a few of the design decisions for that game.
What you might not expect, however, is that Firaxis didn't expect just how successful the game would be on the hybrid console. Speaking to Christopher Dring over at GameIndustry.biz, executive producer Dennis Shirk noticed that PC players (their core player base) were double-dipping: "We found that a lot of our PC players were getting the game on Switch because they could take their game with them."

Fortunately, developer Aggro Crab Games has now released a performance-enhancing update for the Nintendo hybrid, hopefully snipping away some of those problems.
This latest update brings the Switch edition of the game up to ver. 1.0.103.9, and it really seems to be all about the performance. In an accompanying BlueSky post, the developer stated that the "entire game has been significantly optimised", with frame rate improvements in "almost every circumstance".

The upcoming tactical RPG is from Too Kyo Games, the development studio formed by the Danganronpa and Zero Escape creators Kazutaka Kodaka and Kotaro Uchikoshi. And while it features other familiar names to Danganronpa fans — series artist Rui Komatsuzaki and composer Masafumi Takada return after reuniting with Kodaka on Master Detective Archives: Rain Code — there are a few new wrinkles that make this pretty different from the pair's previous games.

The game — which has been out on PS5, Xbox, and Steam since September — comes to Switch on 6th December (we hope - it's been delayed a few times). And when it launches, two Wicked DLC packs will be available to download.

"RPS have never steered us wrong before!" they said, thus cementing our reputation as the most selflessly heroic gaming website, seven years running. What we can’t take credit for, however, is the 1.2 million quid they’ve raised already. If you want to make that number bigger, you can pick up the bundle here, and get 19 Steam keys for your trouble with a minimum donation of £35.
19 is such an annoying number in terms of the page layout that I’m almost convinced to never give to charity again, but there are some very nice games, including the aforementioned Shadows Of Doubt, Dungeons And Degenerate Gamblers, Citizen Sleeper, Another Crab’s Treasure, Two Point Campus, and Deathsprint 66.

V jeho rámci lze distribuovat vlastní obrazy jako tarball, Appx či skrze Windows Store, nicméně dříve byl problém s příliš restriktivní licencí Microsoftu (nutnost souhlasit s podmínkami obchodu a „podepsat“ vývojářský souhlas). To v současných verzích WSL2 už neplatí, Jeremy konstatuje, že s WSL 2.4.4 a vyššími je usnadněna distribuce vlastních obrazů mimo obchod Microsoftu.]]></summary>

"[We’ve] not been able to attract and retain enough players in the long run to compete at the level we aim for in the very demanding free-to-play FPS market," said Ubisoft executive Marie-Sophie de Waubert in a statement to workers that was later posted on Ubisoft's website. Over half the team who worked on the game will lose their jobs at Ubi studios in San Francisco, Osaka, and Sydney. The remaining workers are "transitioning to other roles within Ubisoft."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I downloaded Creeper World IXE's demo, I had it pegged as a bizarre original. It is, in fact, the latest in a series of real-time strategy games in which you position turrets and terraform maps to repel surging, simulated tides of purple liquid. This is a war between flesh and mineral, solidity and fluidity that dates back to the age of Gillen. Alex Wiltshire (RPS in peace) interviewed creator Virgil Wall back in 2019 - amongst other things, we learn that the original Creeper World was based on a "failure" - and Sin has an  enthusiastic piece from 2021 about Creeper World 4, the first 3D instalment.
What does Creeper World IXE bring to the party? Well, 1) it ain't 3D, and 2) it's billed as an exercise in "dominating" the titular Creeper, rather than keeping it at bay. For too long has this sloshing, coruscating hooligan been allowed to wash over and corrode our precious starports. We will take the fight to it in the shape of an upgradeable 2D starfleet, equipped with lasers we can use to chisel away the geography and re-rout the flow of villainous Vimto.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tic-tac-toe, known to British people as noughts and crosses, is a famously boring game that is nonetheless often played by anybody with a sweet wrapper, a pencil and five minutes to burn while waiting for any form of public transport. It's boring because it's a "solved game" whose outcomes can be safely predicted regardless of where you place your first nought or cross, allowing the "perfect" player to at least draw their opponent. It gets played regardless because a lot of people don't know it's a solved game - specifically, young children you may wish to humiliate using your superior grown-up brain, because when you were a child somebody did the same to you. 
How many twisted adults were born from the experience of being bullied via the medium of tic-tac-toe? We'd be better off without this game. But look! Here comes Tic Tactic to shake things up with a touch of Balatro.

After spending a few hours with a beefier build, I’m inclined to agree. But, much like Campus (which gave you real incentive to actually run a smooth operation that genuinely benefited the lazy ratbags stinking up your dorm halls) it’s that extra 15% that really makes all the difference.
James already covered the new exhibits system, and how acquiring and displaying them changes the way you run things, but such globetrotting adventures do little to rattle the pulse of a world-weary mapmuncher like me. No, what I’m actually most excited for when Two Point Museum releases next February is possibly the most ostensibly uninteresting feature added to any videogame ever - partition walls.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Every now and then, somebody has the marvellous idea of developing technology that makes video games smell. I have never been more grateful for this recurrent Quixotic daydream's mass market failure than when watching trailers for Urge, an open world survival shooter that is both fuelled and plagued by piss.


"But hold your horses, young Edwin," you sternly interject. "I do not wish to hear about, let alone play an open world survival shooter that is both fuelled and plagued by piss, on a website that children might read. It sounds like a cheap, taboo-jabbing gimmick." Friend, I once thought as you. But then I did a little research, as is my journalistic responsibility, and it turns out Urge's notions about piss - bladdergold, as they call it in the West Country, or Crusoe Cola, as it's known in the States - are rather in-depth. I'm still very glad I can't smell the game, but I definitely have the urge to play it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Anyone with the need for a new CPU and even the slightest inclination towards tech envy is currently waiting for new stock of the AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D, the unbeatably powerful new chip that our boffin friends at Digital Foundry are calling the fastest gaming CPU ever. If, however, you’re hoping to switch to the 9800X3D from an older system with DDR4 RAM, you’ll need to upgrade that as well as the motherboard, as the entire Ryzen 9000 series only works with newer DDR5 memory.
Cyber Monday won’t help materialise more processors into retailers’ warehouses, but it can help you make this RAM switch on the cheap. Relatively speaking. And I can recommend a nice, fast 32GB kit of Corsair Vengeance DDR5, which is down by £43 in the UK and $22 in the US.

With each mech able to become another mech's worse nightmare, it becomes a game about stretching tight budgets to balance reactive counters with devastating offensives; about identifying the butterfly wings that can send tornados through your opponent’s ranks. It’s about the moments that eat up the hours like nothing else.

Instead of launching the game as expected, these players will see the first-person shooter crash, alongside an error message that reads: "STOP talking SH1T about us". This is an act of revenge for previous criticism of the mod, say the affected videofolks, who are described in the mod's code as "anticitizens".

Yuck. If there’s one type of design that deserves the accolade, though, it’s RPGs that are assured enough in the richness of their worlds to not feel the need to signpost every discovery.
It’s a feedback loop of charitable feelings: the game is saying "we think you’re smart enough to find this stuff on your own". "You’re right!" you respond. "I am smart! And anyone who recognises that must be one smart cookie". Joy abounds, it rains Tunnock’s Caramel Wafers, hedgehogs jig gracefully in the street, and all is right with the world. So, I must say, I’m quite pleased to hear Avowed’s environment region director Berto Ritger sing the virtues of missable content to GamesRadar.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Trouble continues for some of the largest pirate sites specializing in Asian entertainment. Coinciding with the shutdown of Dramacool, GogoAnime and Anitaku stopped uploading new content. This weekend, AnimeFenix added to the trouble with a 'voluntary' shutdown citing more copyright pressure. "Piracy will never go away as long as there are companies with more greed than heart," the AnimeFenix team notes in its farewell message.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I had a horrible dream last night that I had to spend a whole day, as well as a good chunk of the preceding week, rounding up discounted PC hardware. Chilling visions indeed. Good thing today is only Cyber Monday, meaning I can get away with spending a mere 80-85% of the day rounding up discounted PC hardware. Like this: this more powerful Ryzen Z1 Extreme edition of the Asus ROG Ally, a handheld Windows PC that beats the Steam Deck on 720p games performance. With £100 off in the UK and £150 off in the States, it’s now a much closer match on price as well.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last week, Brendy left a note in our weekly Maw liveblog about a player-made map of Caves Of Qud, the reportedly excellent sci-fi roguelike RPG that lets you "chisel through layers of thousand-year-old civilizations", represented as 2D Dwarf Fortress-esque layouts. Glancing over that map as a newcomer to the game, my eye was caught by the creator's casual mention that Caves Of Qud is technically 2,147,483,646 levels deep.
"Is Caves Of Qud really 2,147,483,646 levels deep?" I asked Brendy, like a wide-eyed child asking whether there is such a thing as dog heaven. Brendy wasn't sure. (About Caves Of Qud, I mean, not dog heaven.) So I put the question to one of the developers, Freehold Games co-founder Brian Bucklew. In brief, the answer is yes, but with some significant caveats.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the many high concept ludonarrative experiments I’d one day like to bring to fruition is an immersive sim in which the player has access to many guns, but their default arsenal selection is an open packet of crisps which they hold out in front of them, in first person, and offer to NPCs. Some NPCs wouldn’t be swayed by this, but some would lower their weapons at the offer of a prawn cocktail treat, and so you’d be constantly playing chicken with various guards: edging closer toward them, your shaking hands rattling the delicious disks inside the oily packet, mentally weighing up whether it's worth risking them turning hostile at the last second.
Obviously, I’d scan some real crisp packets and just alter the logos for maximum immersion. One game that’s already taken this scanned bricolage concept and run with it to beautiful effect is Hyperdrive Inn. It’s an avant garde point and click adventure from Finnish studio Horsefly, where the entire world is constructed from scanned fabric samples. Have a looksee.

Before that, we must heap the Maw high with any remaining new video games or video game news from 2024. Find below a few new PC releases for the pile.

Just an endless cycle of microSD cards, mice, microSD cards, mice. At least it’s a good'un, though - the best Steam Deck-compatible microSD of them all, in fact. Previously, its one weakness was the lack of a truly cavernous 1TB model, but that was amended earlier this year, and now that capacity is getting its first major saving as part of Black Friday 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cyber Knights Colon Flashpoint does not lead with its best foot. This is easier to shrug off while it's still in early access, but I will confess some relief when I read that the Trese Brothers (It's pronounced "Trese") nudged their estimated release date back to 2025. It needs a bit longer. But I'm about ready to start recommending it.
I'm a tad biased by my love for their previous Star Traders Colon Frontiers, an interest in mercenary management, and a wish for more turn-based tactics games that aren't bloody XCOM again. That I have reservations about what CKF hasn't yet nailed down is in part a symptom of high expectations. And because despite carrying over some design ethos from Frontiers, Cyber Knights is a very different kind of game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back when Digital Extremes were largely known for collaborating with Epic Games on the Unreal Tournament series, they made a little game called Dark Sector. Released in 2008, it's part of the fine tradition of post-Gears double-A actioners that basically consist of taking a gruff man, throwing him into a world of grit, gravel and burning oil drums, and handing him a murderous gimmick. Dark Sector's gimmick was the glaive, a pointy boomerang you could use to scoop up objects, solve puzzles, and kill stuff in third-person view.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To be clear, I still think the best graphics card deal of Black Friday week is that RTX 4070 Super offer and oh no wait that one’s gone now. But even if hadn’t been ecommerced to death, there’d still be a way to get the upgraded ray tracing and DLSS 3 frame gen tools of the RTX 40 series for less cash still: plucky 1080p contender, the RTX 4060, whose deals are still very much available and kicking.
In the UK, the best available prices are for the MSI GeForce RTX Ventus 2X Black edition, which is the partner card I happen to own myself – and has become the effective go-to GPU for RPS game performance tests. Over in the US, meanwhile, the Gigabyte GeForce RTX 4060 Gaming OC is the most affordable of all; it’s a chunkier design than that of the compact Ventus 2X, though that’s mainly just the tradeoff for having an extra fan. These cards were already on the cheaper end of the RTX 4060 spectrum, and now they’re £30 / $35 off in the sales. Bargain.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As far as Black Friday deals go, the Logitech G502 Hero isn’t so much low-hanging fruit as it is a root vegetable. Every year, this damned multi-buttoned mouse goes on sale, and every year, I’m powerless to avoid writing about it. Can’t even be bothered to take a different header image photo. It’s partly your fault, you know. You like it too much.
This time it’s down from £80 to £26 in the UK (£27 outside the Bezos Empire), which isn’t quite an all-time low, but is pretty close – and a silly-good price for such a capable mouse in any case. Its US discount price of $35 ain’t half bad either, though I notice Amazon US is shouting louder about knocking the newer G502 X down from $80 for $45. That’s mostly a fine mouse as well, though I find its redesigned scroll wheel a bit too much on scratchy side. Of the two, I’d stick with the classic.

The first-person shooter, which is replete with satisfying explosions, gunfire, bullet ricochets, smashing glass, sparks, goo, blood spatters, dust, ice particles, smoke, flecks of plaster, and bad guys yelling at one another about how she's over there, may be described as noisy, both in the aural and visual sense of the word. Which is how we like it, you understand. This latest update to the early access shooter leans into that by layering on even more juicy shootFX. It also adds a whole new game mode and plenty of other tweaks. The bad news is that some story bits are now delayed.

Doubly so in the wake of The Callisto Protocol - a game I still think is worth picking up on a deep discount, if you like hitting gross things with a big bit of metal. It’s quite exciting, then, to learn that the next game from Lies Of P developer Round 8 Studios might just replace that severed limb. Alongside a sequel to the puppety soulslike, they’re also working on a sci-fi survival horror game, via Eurogamer.

But here’s a properly chunky Black Friday discount on the most endearingly out-there Steam Deck rival to date, the Lenovo Legion Go: the 512GB model has shed hundreds of pounds/dollaridoos to fall all the way to £479 / $500. That’s really not a lot for something that goes full luxe on its display and build quality, not to mention its party trick of letting the two controller sections split off, Nintendo-switch style, with one acting as a portable mouse.
This is also the cheapest that the Legion Go has ever gone, at least in the UK, so could make a good pickup if you’ve been wanting something with more power than the Steam Deck range but have been put off by the Legion Go or Asus ROG Ally X’s high launch pricing.

It's small in scope, for one, but also VR would let you see through the eyes of the tooter and slide your trombone note up and down by holding the motion controllers up to your face.

So it is in Trombone Champ: Unflattened, a VR spin-off that's out now.

Discounts are definitely never a bad thing, but Steam sales used to feel like big events on the PC gaming calendar. They don't anymore, to me. Friends, are Steam sales still exciting to you?

Perhaps seeking to wash away any lingering bad karma, Ndemic have now unveiled After Inc: Revival, a blend of city builder and miniature 4X set in the aftermath of a zombie apocalypse. In Plague Inc, you brought the world to an end; now, you must grow it anew from the wreckage.

But what if you could not only survive it, but tame it?
I am Bohdan Beastmaster, aspiring wrangler of all the radiation-twisted insults to God that occupy the Zone. One of its rogue Artifacts exploded my flat, and rather than find a place on SpareRoom, I’ve gone for the easier and safer option of venturing into the wilds of Chornobyl – armed not with rusty AKs or scavenged grenades but the teeth and claws of my mutant soon-to-be companions. The absence of any actual fauna-influencing tools or techniques only makes my plan even simpler: find beasts, aggro beasts onto human enemies, win.

The number of corpses and spilled backpacks on the road imply that someone in battalion headquarters (if such a place even exists) has made a terrible decision.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The genre of 'Action RPG' is supremely annoying to write about, because the term can mean different things to different people, but here’s how I see it: Diablo 4 and similar games, such as Path Of Exile, are 'ARPGs'. Which stands for 'Action RPG'. But Zelda games are 'Action RPGs', which is a totally different genre that you could, if you felt like it, also shorten to 'ARPG'. So, to summarise: ARPGs and ARPGs are two different things, and both are Action RPGs. Got it? Great.
It’s because of this kerfuffle that I’m not exactly mad at Diablo boss Rod Fergusson recently suggesting that we just call games that are similar to Diablo 'Diablo-likes'. I just find it very funny that he’s the one saying it, in a bold faced act of admittedly very inconsequential linguistic colonialism that carries the unspoken connotation that something is "like the game I make, but a bit crap".

Here's the gist of it: I've had enough of gathering rocks and sticks to make a crafting bench, from which I'm forced to build a hut and so on. I'm sure for some this is riveting, but for me, it's something I tire of within seconds.
And so it's with a heavy heart I say that Towers Of Aghasba suffers from the same starting gamut of sticks and stones. There's a hint of some interesting ecosystem stuff springing up a bit later, and judging by the trailers, an ability to clamber on massive flying creatures made of what looks like elephant skin and hair. Still, I just can't do it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've gone on record as not being a huge fan of the artstyle choices used in the new Warcraft I & II remasters. It's crisp and readable, sure, but I'm never exactly thrilled to see all the roughness of older sprites completely done away with, especially when I always felt some of that ruggedness was the point. The tendency of remasters to treat every characterful oddity as a blemish is a wider topic than the scope of this article, but one day, Bluepoint will remaster Bloodborne, and the world will feel my pain. 
Anyway. Nowadays, I'd say Blizzard - or, World Of Warcraft, at least - is pretty much synomous with a softer, more colorful approach to fantasy worlds. While I don't pine for a return to the more boobily ridiculous elements of Frank Frazetta's style, I do often wish that some of the more expressive, pained, and physically grounded elements of classic Sword And Sorcery art was a bit more common. I'm no art scholar, and there's undoubtedly a bit of tunnel vision of my part to this assertion, but as far as as pop culture goes: I see the Blizzard version of fantasy more than I see the Frazetta version, and I don't exactly love it. Same goes for the older, punkier, less uniform sci-fi art from things like 2000 AD and Warhammer 40,000. Edwin touched on some of this in his excellent Space Marine piece. 
Anyway, a valued RPS community member on the Discord shared an older bit of art by Blizzard's Chris Metzen, from the original Starcraft manual. I figured a few of you might enjoy seeing these older pieces, considering how much the overall look of their games has changed over the years.

And what spellbinding vision of a farflung reality could be more fantastical than a game in which a billionaire actually does some work?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Way back in June, treacherous, fickle Larian declared that Baldur's Gate 3 patch 7 would be their final handover to players of the well-good D&D RPG, with the focus then shifting internally to Larian's two currently untitled new game projects. CEO Swen Vincke did, however, caveat that while the overall level of post-release support would be "diminished", there would be a few more updates. We interpreted that to mean bug fixes and the like. Certainly, I wasn't expecting brand new subclasses for every class in the game, which is what you'll get with the just-announced Baldur's Gate 3 patch 8, together with new crossplay functionality and a full-figured photo mode.

I'm scheduling 24 advent calendar posts this week and then spending the rest of the year eating boxes of Cadbury Mini Yule Logs Triple Chocolate. So it's no surprise that Devolver have announced their remaining slate of games aiming for release in 2024 are actually coming out in 2025.

The games that slipped are Baby Steps, Skate Story, and Stick It To The Stickman. Devolver released the news with typical style, via the 15th annual Devolver Delayed awards, which you can watch below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Slipways was the best grand strategy game I'd played in years, because it tossed out all the genre's micromanagement in favour of a strategy puzzle where all your exploiting, expanding, et ceteraing could be squeezed into an hour's play. That game began as a PICO-8 prototype by designer Jakub Wasilewski before being polished to a fine shine in its full release.

All of which is just lead-in to talking about Solitomb, a solitaire-based dungeon crawler in which you fight demons by building hands of playing cards. It's currently - heywaitaminute - a pay-what-you-want PICO-8 prototype by designer Jakub Wasilewski where "all money earned goes towards making the bigger version possible." Like Slipways, it already seems like a frightfully clever piece of design.

Or put another way, if Exo One was Christopher Nolan's Tiny Wings, then this is Colin McRae's Interstellar.

Now there's a demo, and it's substantial with a tutorial, a 10 stage rally, and three "ever-changing Daily Stages with online Steam leaderboards."

I can’t speak for people from other English-language countries, but when I hear somebody talking about their "ring of fire", I tend to assume they’ve been at the vindaloo.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[System requirements are on the rise, and a glut of recent PC facepunchers has left some of the RPS treehouse wondering if it’s time for a graphics card upgrade. Being a helpful colleague and a handsome friend, I dutifully informed them that the highly capable Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 Super is currently getting the Black Friday price cut treatment, with Zotac’s Twin Edge model dropping especially low in both the UK and US. Still, dear readers, if you feel like punishing us for that comment system switch, you could always head over to Amazon and buy up all the stock yourself.
$590 is a decent deal for a model that’s spent most of the past few months at $610, but us Brits are getting the better bargain here - even if it’s not for the OC version. £500 means a hefty £49 slasheroo, the deepest discount this card has seen yet, and you’ll also get a key for Indiana Jones and the Great Circle to play when it releases on December 9th.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's often claimed by liars and fools that our website's title is a clever reference to the ancient Chinese game of shoushiling - or "rock paper scissors", as it's known overseas. The orthodox interpretation is that "Rock Paper Shotgun" is a folksy regional variation on this, with a "shotgun" instead of the "scissors". But friends, this is patently absurd. Think about it: a game that pits a shotgun against a rock or piece of paper would be incredibly one-sided. It goes against reason!
The sad reality is that the origins of our website's title have been deliberately obscured, allowing cold hard fact to slither back into legend. Behind that mockingly nonsensical moniker sleeps an eldritch truth of such gravity it would make Gandalf spill his mead. Friends, the Rock Paper Shotgun is real. The Weapon exists. Or at least, it once did - and will, for I mean to fashion it anew by combing the writing of RPS writers gone by for raw materials. And in this endeavour, I will naturally need your aid.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In hindsight, it’s surprising that it took so long for hardware manufacturers to start making "gaming" earbuds. If the likes of chairs, glasses, and chewing gum can be painted stealth-bomber black and prefixed with the G word, why not something that can actually get off its harshly angled bum and help pipe the games themselves into your head?
Then again, maybe gaming earbuds were just waiting for their moment. Obviously the Nintendo Switch is the Nintendo Switch, but the rise of handhelds like the Steam Deck and Asus ROG Ally has driven desires for more portable (yet games-friendly) noise-deliverers 'round these PC parts as well. Thus, for another edition of Should You Bother With – the RPS column where a diaphragm of testing vibrates advice directly into the cochlea of understanding – let’s have a listen of these wireless buds and find out whether they’re a worthy replacement for your current go-to headphones.

But hiding in the patch notes is an apology of sorts, a nod to that most tenacious of bunnyhopper: the Half-Life 2 speedrunner.

Valve have now corrected that, removing the offending blocker and restoring order to the universe. Well, almost.

You can't do that with baby shoes, you anonymous hack!
Silent Hill 2 remake’s senior narrative designer Barbara Kciuk reckons this principle extends to much bigger productions. "It is a bit niche, but actually, the interesting part about horror is that it is one of the best ratios when it comes to the cost of production and the earnings," she recently told TheGamer’s Rhiannon Bevan.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We've been working for a while on the next ScummVM release, and it is time for a call for public testing.
Support for a number of new engines and games for the existing ones was added, and we need your special attention to the following titles:
Orion Burger.
Total Eclipse and Total Eclipse 2.
Thimbleweed Park.
The Space Bar.
Moonbase Commander. (with multiplayer support)
Backyard Basketball.
Unrest.
Rise of the Dragon.
Castle Master.
Wait for it! Issue 3. Song for a Hare. (Ну, погоди! Выпуск 3. Песня для зайца)
Mask Show. (Маски-шоу)
Marvellous Mice Adventures: Meeting Sea Rat. (Три маленькие белые мышки. Визит Морской крысы)
The Adventures of the Good Soldier Schweik. (Похождения бравого солдата Швейка)
Marvellous Mice Adventures: Sea Rat's Birthday. (Три маленькие белые мышки. День рождения морской крысы)
Besides these newly supported games, almost half of the current 108 engines have notable changes. Thus, testing more games is always a good thing.
All testing must be done with stable builds, not development ones. Please report bugs or oddities on our issue tracker.
A detailed list of all exciting new features and fixes is available in our NEWS file.
We are looking forward to your reports about successful and unsuccessful playthroughs and bugs reported!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mladá studentka Jindřiška přichází domů a zjišťuje, že jejich luxusní dům je v dražbě, všechen majetek v exekuci a její otec se kdesi skrývá a není k zastižení, zatímco matka netuší, co se vlastně stalo a jak otec ty dluhy nadělal, nebo o tom aspoň nechce mluvit. Debutující scenárista a režisér Vojtěch Strakatý nám přináší drama děvčete, které netuší, co si počít.


Existuje vícero českých filmů, které surfují na oblíbené vlně "zakažte exekutory, zrušte dluhy, je to nelidské!" (například Tancuj Matyldo). After Party takovým filmem není. Exekutoři se v něm chovají korektně a slušně a vinu na situaci celé rodiny nese naprosto jednoznačně otec, který neopatrně investoval, i když nevíme jak.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Castle Master, the haunting conclusion to the Freescape engine saga, is now ready for public testing!
Prepare yourself for a perilous adventure as you lower the drawbridge to enter the Castle Master’s domain. Released in 1990 by Incentive Software, Castle Master became popular for its technical innovation and challenging gameplay. The game inspired countless 3D adventure titles, and the Freescape engine itself marked a technological milestone, enabling groundbreaking object interaction and spatial puzzles.
Notably, Castle Master was one of the first games to let you choose to play as either a prince or a princess, offering a different experience depending on your choice.
Your mission: rescue your twin, imprisoned within the eerie depths of Castle Eternity by the evil Magister. This sprawling, foreboding castle is filled with traps, monsters, and puzzles blocking your path. Gather items, unlock doors, and solve complex riddles as you navigate the labyrinthine halls and confront the dark forces within.
This modern reimplementation showcases enhanced graphics using OpenGL, with initial support for the DOS and ZX Spectrum releases. If you’re eager to embark on this dark journey, a playable demo is available to test your tenacity.
To participate in the testing, ensure you have a daily development build. We encourage all players to submit feedback and bug reports through our issue tracker.
Will you brave the creepy corridors of Castle Eternity and free your sibling, or will you fall victim to the Magister’s curse and join his army of enslaved spirits? The adventure awaits!
