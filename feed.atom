You'll also get to watch those kombatants team up with three Kameo fighters: Kano, Sonya, and Jax.

Humble Games announced today that their battle focused Temtem: Showdown is now available to download for free on Steam. The game is essentially a standalone variant of the Pokémon-like Temtem that released out of early access last year. You do not need to purchase the previous Temtem game in order to access Temtem: Showdown.
[caption id="attachment_388841" align="alignnone" width="640"] Image via Humble Games[/caption]
Gotta battle em' all!
Temtem: Showdown takes out the taming and leveling from the base game, and focuses purely on the combat. Dubbed a "free multiplayer battle simulator", players can build a team in seconds and dash into ranked matches with players from all over the world. At its core, Temtem's battle system features action-packed 2v2 battles. It'll feel familiar to anyone who's played a bit of doubles in online Pokémon matches.
Competitive play seems to be a huge part of the game, featuring a climbable ranked ladder system. Furthermore, the game will have community-run tournaments as well as an official esports circuit called TemCS. According to to the Steam page, the circuit will reward huge prizes.
Seasons will also be a thing in Temtem: Showdown. There will be a new season every few months, changing up the meta and introducing new combinations to play with when doing battle.
I haven't got a chance to play Temtem yet, though it's in my backlog to play on PS5. I have heard great things about its battle system though, so this seems like the right idea to make it accessible to more players. While Temtem is available on PC, Switch, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S, it looks like Temtem: Showdown is only available via Steam for now.
If you want to give the game a try, you can check out Temtem: Showdown now for free on Steam.

We'd previously covered reports from eagle-eyed fans who claimed Barbie's cars would be making their way into Forza Horizon 5. His assessment was correct. Microsoft has just added both the Chevrolet Corvette that Barbie drives in the movie, as well as Ken's GMC HUMMER EV Pickup to Forza Horizon 5's drivable roster.
Microsoft has said that to get them both, all players have to do is check their Forza Horizon 5 message center. Everything for free, no paid DLC. Just get the cars and let's go party.

Some could have jumped at the opportunity to complain that they wanted *insert name of edgy, bat-themed vehicle here* and not this. But the Chevrolet is no slouch.

And it looks pretty damn good in photo mode.

Anyone who's not into giving Barbie's preferred ride a chance can go with the much more aggressive HUMMER Pickup.

As the unexpectedly great box-office war of Barbie vs Oppenheimer draws ever nearer, Barbie reveals she has no trouble fighting on the most unexpected of fronts. Is this how Greta Gerwig's live-action take on the popular doll will take down Christopher Nolan's three-hour-long wartime drama? Will Fortnite soon host an event showing the horrendous effects of nuclear weapons as Nolan tries to win the gamer populace back? Only time will tell. Oppenheimer opens in theatres on July 20. Barbie catches up to him in her Chevy just one day later, on July 21.
As for the Forza Horizon 5 cars, you can download those right now.

Unsurprisingly, these monitors also cost a huge amount of money, with even lower-end options in the £600+ range and higher-end examples in the quadruple figures. 
Two or three years on, things have settled down and these HDMI 2.1 monitors are now much more affordable - if not yet exactly cheap. One such example is the Acer Nitro XV282KKV, a 28-inch monitor with a 4K 144Hz refresh rate on PC, that's down to £409.98 plus £5 shipping at Ebuyer. That's nearly £200 off its UK RRP and an awesome deal for a monitor with these specs.

Woody Woodpecker is how the Gods of Animation punished humankind for creating anime. I will never understand the appeal of centering an entire property around a character deliberately created to be annoying. He’s like Bugs Bunny, except you never feel the need to root for him. No, he’s more like Batman’s Joker, but you replace all the charisma with just a second heaping of insane malice. I hate him so much.
So, I bought a game that headlines him. It’s 2000’s Woody Woodpecker Racing for PS1 and Windows. I bought this specifically so I could remind my brain that it’s trapped here in this hell with me. However, it kind of seems like the developers weren’t exactly fans either, since that blasted Woodpecker isn’t my biggest complaint with the game.

Sand Land is an odd situation. Announced during the Summer Game Fest 2023 live show, Sand Land is an interesting pick for an ILCA-developed, Bandai Namco-published action-RPG adaptation.
While many in the west are familiar with Akira Toriyama's work, Sand Land isn't quite as popular as, say, Dragon Ball. But that relative disparity is what made Sand Land interesting to me. I've seen tons of Dragon Ball. I don't know much about Sand Land. And after playing a little bit of the latter at Summer Game Fest 2023, I'm curious to see even more of its Mad Max-like arid wastes.
For those unfamiliar, Sand Land is a single-volume manga from Toriyama set in a world with little water. After years of disasters and war have ravaged the land, a single king lords over the water supply. The e…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The quick brown deer jumped over the lazy owl.
Some people can't help but translate things. We see languages, and we want to decipher them, like the people who climb Mount Everest just because it's there. The languages in games like FEZ, Titan Souls, Heaven's Vault, 7 Days To End With You, and Noita, invite the player to try to crack them to reveal more of the game's lore, and players are often rewarded for doing so, even if it's usually just extra story. Translating the Fez language was literally the first thing I did, and it basically revealed the whole plot of the game before I'd even started. Oops!
But those game examples are all made on indie budgets. What happens when a gigantic, multi-billion-dollar company like Nintendo makes its own language? The answer is that we get THREE languages. The Zelda series has Hylian, Sheikah, and as of Tears of the Kingdom, Zonai — three languages that look very different and were designed to represent the culture of each of their races.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So they’ll be… fresher?
Nintendo and Oreo have revealed that Luigi and the rest of the Super Mario gang are going to be crossing over into the world of cookies. Pre-orders are now open for limited edition Oreo x Super Mario cookies. And I don’t know how I can remain shocked that this is where the FOMO market has gotten us.
A pack of Orea x Super Mario includes 12 cookies, and there are 16 designs in all. Of the 16 embossed designs, one of them features Luigi, and none of them depicts Monty Mole. If you eat the entire package by yourself, you’ll be treating yourself to 720 calories and immeasurable shame.
Oreos are also challenging you to balance the allegedly rare Bowser cookie on the edge of a glass and then stack all the other characters on top of it until it all collapses. I guess this is a social media thing. No prize has been announced, but they say, "The Oreo brand may even have a surprise in store for fans who rise to the challenge, defeat Bowser and save the Mushroom Kingdom." Oh, gosh, there's a trailer on the site.
Huh. Oreos definitely aren’t bad cookies, and I have no problems with product marketing. This just seems a bit extra. Preorders for a Cookie? Maybe this is normal, and I'm the one who's out of touch. It reminds me of the Super Mario Cereal, where the box was also an Amiibo. I still have never seen a physical box of that stuff. It disappeared the moment it hit the shelf. Even still, I wouldn’t have pre-ordered it.
If you do want to pre-order some cookies, there’s a limit of 1 per order. That means your pre-order can’t possibly net you all 16 designs. Weird. However, they will appear in stores like any normal cookie. Their release into the world begins on July 10, 2023.

Reddit user u/RecommendationOk6842 over on the HyruleEngineering subreddit has shared their latest creation — a pair of weighing scales. We've all got something like this in our home, or have at least seen them, but this simple device — made up of planks of wood, swords, brooms, a wheel, and a Stabilizer Zonai device — could unlock many secrets in Tears of the Kingdom.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Both the Vanilla and GOTY editions
Remember Fallout 4? Of course you do. It's barely eight years old! Well, for those of you who have yet to play it, now seems like a good time, as it's currently on offer for ridiculously cheap. With Starfield still a few months away, you might want something to do until then. And let's face it, we've all pretty much had our fill of Skyrim.
So how much is Fallout 4 at the moment? Head on over to the Steam page and you'll see that you can pick up the vanilla copy of the game for $6.59 (or £5.27 for our British readers). That's a pretty magnificent 67% off the usual price. But it doesn't end there, either.
[caption id="attachment_388625" align="aligncenter" width="1200"] Image via Bethesda.[/caption]
Say you fancy "going big" and you want the Game of the Year edition. Well, that too is on sale, now priced at $9.99 (or £8.74). The GOTY version of Fallout 4 comes with all the official expansions, including Far Harbor and Nuka-World.
You'll need to be a little quick though if you want to take advantage of the promotion, as it ends on June 29. That still gives you a few days to make a purchase, but it's not going to be around for long.
But let's say you don't fancy playing Fallout 4. Maybe you've already got a copy of it and you've been playing it to death since 2015. Well, you might be interested in hearing about the Fallout: London. This is a fan project that, as the name suggests, tells a F4 story in England's capital city. The DLC-sized mod is loaded with custom content and is expected to release sometime in 2023, so keep an eye out for that.

Atari has announced two new titles getting refreshed as part of their ongoing efforts, Quantum: Recharged and Haunted House. Neither has a stated release window, but both will be dropping on all consoles, PC, and the Atari VCS.
Quantum: Recharged is the next in Atari’s Recharged line of game revivals. These have included Yars: Recharged and Gravitar: Recharged. This time, they’re focusing on Quantum, which is a bit of an obscure title, but it was included in the Atari 50 collection. It’s a 1982 arcade title that uses vector graphics. You would use a trackball to try and engulf dots and other shapes. The closest I can come to a comparison is Qix, but I feel like that isn’t all that sufficient.

However, it seems there are some secret post-credit scenes that only a few players have been able to see.

This past weekend saw Street Fighter 6 make arguably its biggest debut on the international platform to date, as players rolled up to the Daytona Beach Ocean Center for prestigious fighting game tournament CEO 2023 — Three straight days of intense, hard-hitting, and uber-hype fighting action.
While there were plenty of excellent scrappers on deck, including Tekken 7, Dragon Ball FighterZ, Guilty Gear Strive, and The King of Fighters XV, most eyes were on Capcom's recent release, as CEO would offer one of the best opportunities yet to see how SF6 was progressing — both popularity wise and meta wise — on the big stage. When the doors opened, we got something of an answer, as just under 1,100 players showed out for the newest fighter on the block. An incredible number, to say t…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not enough reason to spend more time with Rabbids.
To the surprise of pretty much everyone, the original Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle became one of the best tactics games on the Nintendo Switch. We loved its tight, puzzle-like missions and vibrant world that somehow presented Ubisoft’s Rabbids as less-than-annoying – even, dare we say, sometimes endearing. The sequel followed suit, impressing critics and fans alike with a handful of great planets to explore, though we preferred the tight gameplay of the first over the creative freedom of Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope.
One area where Kingdom Battle excelled was its Donkey Kong Adventure DLC. Completely separate from the campaign, it saw Rabbid Peach teaming up with Donkey and Cranky Kong to take on a Rabbid threat, resplendent with an overwhelming amount of nostalgic Donkey Kong Country references. To say we have high hopes for Sparks of Hope’s DLC is an understatement, and unfortunately, the first major DLC – following the season pass-exclusive update The Tower of Doooom – fails to reach the same heights despite being a fun little addition to the base game.

If you haven't been keeping a close eye on the Oblivion/Skyrim modding community, you may have missed out on the progress of Skyblivion. The fan-made modification takes TES4 and rebuilds it in TES5's engine, and the scope of this project is one for the ages. Now, the volunteers working on this unofficial remake has shared a new video that shows the current progress plus what's left to do.
The 10-minute footage over on YouTube is essentially a checklist of how much has been done on Skyblivion since work began in 2012. While there's still a way to go, So far the team has managed to map around 82% of Oblivion's world. On top of that, roughly 40% of the interiors have been done, a third of the "meshing" is now complete, and nearly 100 quests are described as "playable".
https://youtu.be/H1q1nXLDjB8
The video also shows how much is still left, with a staggering amount of work still ahead for the modders. They're also calling out for additional help, so if you feel you have the skills and want to contribute towards Skyblivion's success, you can become a volunteer.
The team also recently celebrated eight years of continuous work that's gone into the project. As it stands, the fan remake is due to release sometime in 2025, so there are still a couple more years to go. The best thing about it is it'll be completely free. You just need official copies of both Skyrim and Oblivion, as well as the expansions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Publisher Humble Games and developer Crema have revealed Temtem Showdown, a new standalone battle-focused game, and it's out right now. 
This surprise reveal comes less than a year after the full 1.0 release of Temtem, the game that Showdown is based on. Similar to Pokemon Showdown, Temtem Showdown is all about battling. It's also free to everyone. 
"Temtem Showdown takes the best Temtem competitive action and places it within immediate reach for everyone," a press release reads. "Get to know the colorful critters from the massively multiplayer creature-collection adventure, build your team in seconds, and dash into battle to test it out against other players and their teams – or carefully curate a plan of action to overpower your opponents." 
Unlike Temtem, which is a multiplayer Pokemon-like game where you catch and train Temtem to use in 2 vs. 2 battles, Showdown will let players build a team from scratch right from the jump. And then you can hop right into a battle, without needing to worry about their level like you might in the base game. You can play against other players both casually and competitively, and the latter will feature a ranked system and a ladder to climb up as you play. 
Crema says Showdown will receive regular balance patches to keep the meta fair, and new Seasons will bring additional content and changes as well.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back on the shores of hell
In 2020, Nightdive Studios released a source port of the oft-forgotten Doom 64 that brought it to modern platforms and reintroduced it to a new, more receptive audience. Beyond simply porting it, however, they added a new episode that better links it to the rest of the Doom series narrative. Now fans have implemented the new episode back into the N64 version as Doom 64: Complete Edition.
This means that if you, for whatever reason (not judging), preferred the N64 version of Doom 64, you can play it again without sacrificing the extra features of Nightdive Studios’ source port. This all sounds really difficult, since the 2020 version runs on Nightdive’s proprietary Kex Engine. I’m assuming the maps still exist in an extractable format because I imagine it would be too much work to try to manually recreate them for a release such as this.
[caption id="attachment_388694" align="alignnone" width="640"] Image via MobyGames[/caption]
Beyond simply adding the extra maps, Doom 64: Complete Edition adds a number of quality-of-life upgrades. You can find them at this link. One of the most important revisions for me, however, is the ability to disable three-point texture filtering. This was what was mostly to blame for everything on the N64 looking blurry. They also improved the framerate in some areas and enabled support for the Expansion Pak upgrade. That’s some good stuff!
If you haven’t played Doom 64, it’s definitely worth checking out. It always had its fans, but Nightdive’s port helped force a wider re-assessment of Midway’s contribution to the series. Personally, I don’t think it’s better than Doom, but I might put it above Doom 2. However, it has its own style and approach to the series’ formula.
The Doom 64: Complete Edition fan patch can be found here.

The cookies feature 16 unique embossments starring characters like Mario, Luigi, Yoshi, Goomba, and Bowser Jr., as well as power-ups like Super Stars and Fire Flowers. Packs will be filled at random. Oreo is also holding a social media event where they're asking those who buy the cookies to stack as many of the hero-embossed cookies on the rim of a glass of milk without the cookies falling into the milk and share the video on social media in a concerted effort to save Princess Peach from Bowser's Castle.
"We hope to unite cookie lovers and Super Mario enthusiasts alike with this playful mission, inspired by a storyline fans know all too well," Oreo senior brand manager Vishnu Nair said in a press release. "We may even reveal a surprise as a thank you to those who successfully defeat Bowser and save the kingdom... Fans will have to wait and see!"
You can check out a fun musical trailer for the collaboration below.


The Oreo x Super Mario cookies will begin rolling out to retailers nationwide starting July 10, but will only be available for a limited time.

Yes, you read that headline correctly.

Sing & Swim Party is a rhythm adventure game where you will play as one of the five members of the Shark family (Baby, Mommy, Daddy, Grandma or Grandpa) making your way to the Fin-Tastic Festival. The gameplay seems to consist of either a 'Rhythm Mode' or a 'Runner Mode' where the objective is to keep to the beat of a variety of popular Baby Shark songs.

Publisher Warner Bros Games and developer Player First Games have officially called time on both Wabbit Season and Duck Season — The extended "beta" for platform fighter MultiVersus has been officially taken offline, bringing brings an end to one of the most questionable fighting game debuts in recent history. MultiVersus is currently expected to relaunch in "early 2024".
The free-to-play scrapper's servers are closed, ending a bizarre "test" phase that simultaneously had multiple seasons and additional paid DLC characters, skins, and stages. While MultiVersus players still have access to local Vs. matches and the fighter’s training mode, (known as “The Lab”), the community is now unable to play online in any capacity. Additionally, the studio has a…]]></summary>

While his comments were part of the ongoing Actiblizz acquisition malarkey (the point seemingly being "it's so big it'd be too hard to optimise for PS5"), hearing him pitch Bethesda's upcoming grey-rocks-but-in-space-this-time RPG as "irresponsibly large" made me want to go full Reggie Perrin.
Every time I bring my reviews of giant games to the altar of the industry, I weep tears of blood and beg that games be shorter. And every time the golden idol with the face of Phil Spencer opens its maw to spit a new £80 disc out and says: "Bigger than ever before. A million pointless collectibles. A feast of zero-calorie content. Lol. Lmao."

If you've played Alan Wake Remastered on the Switch (or any other platform, for that matter) then you'll have no doubt noticed that the opening line is quite unique in that it directly quotes the exceptionally popular author, Stephen King.
This was a deliberate decision from the game's writer Sam Lake, who told Eurogamer that he "really, really, desperately wanted" to be able to open the game with a King quote specifically, presumably because the story itself pulls a great deal of inspiration from King's extensive work.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Why bother?
As is the case whenever an older major third-party franchise gets announced for the Nintendo Switch, eyebrows were raised when the Batman: Arkham Trilogy was revealed in Nintendo's recent Direct presentation. It turns out that skepticism was on point!
According to WB, although the Arkham Trilogy will be sold physically, the cart only contains Batman: Arkham Asylum. Yep, only one of the games in the "trilogy" will be included physically, and you'll need to download the rest. Don't just take it from me, read the entire FAQ entry on the game's official site:
Does the Nintendo Switch physical version of Batman: Arkham Trilogy include all three games on one cartridge?
Batman: Arkham Asylum will be included on the Batman: Arkham Trilogy game cartridge. Batman: Arkham City and Batman: Arkham Knight will require an online connection to download and install both titles when the Batman: Arkham Trilogy cartridge is inserted into the Nintendo Switch console. All three games will then be playable as long as the cartridge is inserted into the Nintendo Switch console.

Welp! At least you get "all previously released DLC" with that download when it comes out this fall!
This is part of a longer trend for third-party games
Although The Witcher 3 managed to cram the game on a higher-capacity cart, many third-party Switch games have suffered the same fate as the Arkham Trilogy. In fact, Arkham wasn't the only series that's fending off criticism in that very same Nintendo Direct, as Konami revealed that Metal Gear Solid Master Collection Vol 1 would also require massive downloads.
Start clearing up your SD space now if you're partaking in either of them later this year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Possibly next-gen?
We're already painfully aware that Bethesda is taking its sweet time with The Elder Scrolls 6. However, there may be longer to wait still, as even the Head of Xbox Gaming, Phil Spencer, admits he doesn't even know what platform it's going to be on. There may be a few more years to go until the anticipated sequel ever sees the light of day.
And exactly how long are we talking? Well, according to journalist Stephen Totilo, (reporting on the Microsoft/Activision court case), Spencer npted that Elder Scrolls 6 could be "five-plus years away." If true, this would put the elusive Skyrim follow-up on track for a 2028 release at the earliest. As such, it could mean that the long-awaited Bethesda RPG is actually on deck for gaming's next generation.
https://twitter.com/stephentotilo/status/1672314548995366935
According to a recent report from The Verge, Spencer did say in a 2021 interview that it will be exclusive to Xbox, though it doesn't necessarily mean it will be this generation's Xbox. When questioned about this today, the executive doesn't recall ever making such a statement. And so, it stands, we're not really any closer to understanding what's happening with the next Elder Scrolls installment. A couple of years ago, Todd Howard said the game was still in early development.
All we can really hope is that once Starfield is released this September, then Bethesda will be willing to spill a few more beans. We can assume that, for now, the studio is just keeping its cards close to its chest.

Prior to the September 2022 Nintendo Direct showcase, you would be forgiven for having given up hope that Pikmin 4 even exists. This was a seed that was planted by Shigeru Miyamoto way back in 2015, after all, and despite being drip-fed small updates over the ensuing seven years, we were beginning to think that perhaps the fourth mainline entry in the series had fallen onto the pile of cancelled Nintendo projects that would never see the light of day.
When that September Direct happened, everything changed. We knew the game was real and that it would come to Switch in 2023. That was just about all of the information that we got at the time, but it was a start. A slow but steady stream of Pikmin 4 details followed, with release dates and trailers sprouting at random intervals as if to comfortably remind us all that the game is actually coming out this time.

That impressive feat goes to BattleBit Remastered, a 254-player FPS that mixes Battlefield’s large-scale skirmishes, Roblox’s low-poly aesthetics, and some wild destructible environments.

A little less than a week ago, Nintendo once again showed us the staying power of the Direct, and gave us a ton of announcements and a few surprise releases. We have a full recap here, but if you're a visual learner, Nintendo recently tweeted out a full infographic of what was announced or reconfirmed; with the first-party cream rising to the top.
[caption id="attachment_388663" align="alignnone" width="640"] Image via Nintendo[/caption]
If I had to guess what would win a "most excited" poll, it would be Mario RPG
I'm still cautiously optimistic about Super Mario Bros. Wonder (I hope the gimmicks are more than skin-deep), but based on the almost universally-positive reaction to the Super Mario RPG revival, I'd say that takes the highest hype spot. I mean, it's at the top of my list too! Re-releasing Pikmin 1 and 2 was a genius move as well, as you can get the entire mainline Pikmin series on one platform now. That's kind of become a calling card for the Nintendo Switch: a successor to the 3DS in its own right, collecting both old, new, and new-again games in one spot.
As for Detective Pikachu Returns, it's in a super weird spot. We're years removed from the film, and I'm the only person I know who actually played the original Detective Pikachu from start to finish. It'll be interesting to see how the game performs, and if it gets another gigantic amiibo.

Nintendo is once again proving itself to be the master of optimisation on the Switch, if the estimated file size for Super Mario Bros. Wonder is anything to go by.
As reported by the folks over at Nintendo Everything, the official eShop is currently listing the upcoming platformer at a rather reasonable 4.3GB (quick note: the US eShop lists the game at 4.5GB, so we're guessing the exact figure is somewhere between the two). This is, of course, subject to change over the coming months, but it sounds like you probably won't need to organise a mass clear-out of your SD card anytime soon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Battle Beyond the Stars
Bethesda has confirmed that the "Constellation Edition" of its upcoming space opera Starfield will not contain an actual disc of the game itself, and will instead feature a download code for the chosen platform. The publisher noted this controversial development in a tweet from its support team.
"Hello!" said the team, responding directly to a fan's question. "All physical editions include a code for the chosen platform. There are no physical discs". The tweet has since been deleted from Twitter.
The community understandably responded unhappily to the news, with some decrying the return of "non-physical physical editions", while others pointed to the continued slant toward a future where archiving games becomes a much-more-difficult venture without hard copies of the games themselves. The response was overwhelmingly negative, with some, (some as Twitter's Wario64), pointing out that certain adverts for Starfield's physical release had clearly stated that a disc was included.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfYEiTdsyas
The removal of the initial tweet suggested that there were crossed wires somewhere along the chain of communication. And that indeed proved to be the case, as it now seems that while the standard edition of Starfield will feature a physical disc including game code, it is purely the $250 Constellation Edition that will not — a digital download code for the title being issued as part of this version. And so, anybody who wishes to pick up the Collector's Edition and own a physical disc of the sci-fi spectacle will, at this stage, be required to pick up both versions.
Starfield launches September 6 on PC and Xbox Series X/S.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Annnd, it's stuck in our heads again.
We had just about managed to get Bowser's Mario Movie love ballad, 'Peaches', out of our heads after singing it on repeat for the past three months. Now the voice of Bowser himself Jack Black has ensured that we're humming it all over again after he performed the song live at last night's The Game Awards 10-Year Concert.
Dressed in the full king of the Koopas garb that we previously saw the actor wear in the Lyrical Lemonade music video, Jack Black's rocking vocals were accompanied by a full orchestra as he performed the song live to a crowd of fans — who, by the sounds of it, couldn't help but sing along.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over the weekend, DDoS attacks on Blizzard caused a bunch of issues for Diablo IV and other Battle.net games such as Overwatch 2. The cyber attacks prevented many players from logging into Diablo IV, and the hack-and-slashers that managed to log in were at risk of “high latency and disconnections” in the always-online RPG. That tragically forced many gamers to step outside during the hottest weekend in recent memory. Thankfully, Blizzard now states the DDoS attacks have ended, meaning everything should be working as normal.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[But the Blessed Mother returned
Blizzard Entertainment was hit with a huge DDOS attack this weekend, which ensured that several titles, including recent release Diablo 4, were offline and unplayable for an extended period of time. The DDOS attack has since passed, and the dungeon-crawling sequel is, as of this writing, fully playable once again.
While players started noticing issues late Saturday, the attack was first noted by the studio itself on the morning of Sunday, when a brief message posted to Twitter said that the team was "currently investigating an issue affecting our authentication servers". Players had noticed that they were unable to log in to titles such as Diablo 4 and World of Warcraft during this time. The studio then confirmed that it was undergoing a DDOS attack, wherein parties intently overrun a server with requests, causing an information lockup or even a full collapse.
https://twitter.com/BlizzardCS/status/1673082677115666440?s=20
Later that day, Blizzard announced that the attack had ended and that normal service had been resumed. The DDOS attack effectively lasted less than a day but, given that it was Sunday, it no doubt cut into some valuable playing time for those who are only able to delve into Blizzard's worlds during the weekend hours. Malicious DDOS attacks remain a problem for online communities, whether targeted at specific websites or full gaming networks and streaming services.
Diablo 4 is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

Note: there is specific mention of two Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom bosses in the following list. Only read on if you have finished the main game or are not concerned about avoiding spoilers!
We must admit: Zelda rankings tend to look a little samey, perhaps with a few spicy changes based on the person. But you'll never find Breath of the Wild at the bottom, or Tri Force Heroes at the top, even if the person making that list is the world's most contrary list-maker.

It was the Japanese cover that walked away with the win on that occasion, securing 46% of the vote, closely followed by Europe with 39% while North America brought up the rear with the remaining 15%.

We've had some real treats join the humongous Arcade Archives range this past month. Not only did we get rare puzzler Tetris: The Absolute Grand Master 2 and run 'n' gun classic Rolling Thunder 2, but this week sees Hamster delve back into the Namco catalog and emerge with its controversial horror scrapper, Splatterhouse!
Released to Japanese arcades in 1988, before heading west the following year, this ultra-iconic release has managed to retain its brand power over the ensuing decades, despite ultimately being a series of visually exciting, but fairly average titles. Inspired by an array of hyper-violent horror franchises, Splatterhouse sees hero Rick sally forth into the mansion of Dr. Henry West, on a do-or-die mission to rescue his girlfriend, Jennifer, from the truly unhol…]]></summary>

The Sensor Bar. Flimsy little plastic box with the world's longest, spindliest cable. An irritation to every Wii owner who has ever had to move their console. What was it good for?
There's not a lot to the Sensor Bar. A little device that emits some infrared light. If the Wii Remote is pointed at one, it recognises that's where the TV is. It's not high-tech. Famously, its functionality can be replicated by two candles. Cheap, cheerful, reliable.

Story of Seasons: A Wonderful Life offers a slightly different take on the well-worn farming sim genre. As a new resident of the Forgotten Valley, you’re still here to revitalize an old farm and socialize with the townsfolk, but it’s that second aspect that takes a central role here. The point of your new life in this hamlet isn’t to save a farm or to stop the development of a theme park...
You’re here to make a life for yourself, one that is filled with love, family, and friends.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A test of patients.
The past few years have reminded us that many countries’ healthcare systems are not in good shape. Even so, it’s hard to appreciate the challenges that healthcare workers face if you’re not one. Fall of Porcupine aims to do this in an approachable way by putting players in the scrubs of 2D animal doctors. Unfortunately, the latest release from Critical Rabbit isn’t the hard-hitting medical drama wrapped in a fuzzy waffle blanket that we would’ve liked. This cute game has so much potential, but it needed more care and a focused narrative to really soar.
An impressive amount of research and interviews have gone into the game’s much-needed commentary – everything from full beds to alternative medicine to corporate hospital management. It’s a shame all that research results in a flatline story with repetitive mechanics. You control Finley, an anthropomorphised pigeon and the newest doctor at St. Ursula's Hospital in the town of Porcupine. As you tend to patients, your boss, white cheetah Dr Krokowski, is constantly less than impressed with you. There’s also a fellow newbie doctor, a suspicious janitor, a chief physician, and MANY more characters who take the form of various animals.

I'm in the UK for a few days and long for my new/current homeland, where it is also very hot but at least the biscuits and chicken fillet rolls are very good. Still, this weekend I might get a walk-in tattoo and eat some eggy bread, which I am told adults refer to as French toast. I tell you what I probably won't be doing though: playing some video games! I'm away from home and didn't bring any portables with me. Luckily the rest of the team can make up for me.

Microsoft is currently locked in a courtroom battle with the Federal Trade Commission over its proposed $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard, and although the focus is mostly on Xbox, on day two of the proceedings, the Nintendo Switch has already been dragged into the fight.
According to The Verge, the FTC has been attempting to argue the Switch is "very different" to the Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5 - suggesting it's not really part of the same market by comparing its technical capabilities, with lines about its frame rate and how it compares in terms of GPU teraflops.

During the third annual Sonic Central, Sega has announced that LEGO Sonic will be playable in the DLC for the upcoming Sonic Superstars. Even beyond that, if you pre-order Sonic Superstars, you’ll also get the ability to transform Robotnik into LEGO Eggman. Leggman!
That’s about it. Uh, here’s a trailer.
https://youtu.be/qi8zAunO9xw
That was fun! As you can see, it does everything I told you. Sonic the Hedgehog is replaced by the LEGO minifig of the classic ‘90s veteran. I’m not sure how accurate this is to what the DLC will be like, but I’m hoping that Robotnik will always appear like that if you use the skin.
It’s really classy for Sega to announce both DLC and pre-order bonuses right together. Classic Sega. This seems like not a lot for DLC. Will we see LEGO minifigs of the other characters? I’m guessing no, but you never know.
Sonic Superstars is, of course, the upcoming classic-styled sidescroller with four-player co-op. I’m looking forward to it, but I keep getting flashbacks to the co-op in the Genesis Sonic the Hedgehog games. It was so awful to whoever was stuck as Tails. When my husband and I were first dating, he was really excited to find out that Sonic the Hedgehog 2 has co-op. I tried to check his expectations, but even then, he was extremely disappointed when we finally sat down to play it. It’s only slightly better than handing your sibling an unplugged controller so they can pretend to play along.
Sonic Superstars is going to be released sometime later this year for PS4/PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Switch, and PC. Not sure about the LEGO Sonic DLC, but with Leggman being a pre-order bonus, it sounds like it will be released alongside the game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[House of Doomed Leaves
If bringing a novel to the big screen is a tough job, then making a movie into a video game tends to spell doom from the get-go. And we don't mean the good kind of Doom. Go ahead, try to think of a film's video game tie-in or even a less rushed adaptation that's even a tad beyond "meh". If it took your mind no more than one second to think of The Chronicles Of Riddick: Escape From Butcher Bay, then congrats. You win.
But that's an absolute anomaly in the history of video games. We're talking about a tie-in that'd be better than its movie even if the movie were good. Given the adaptation curse that no one can deny, it'd be no surprise if a Doom 2 mod inspired by a novel would result in the ultimate failure. But... it did not.

Seeing all the great demos this week has made me far more excited about the future of video games than any of the notE3 streams did the other week, and I'm not gonna lie, a large part of my excitement stems from the brilliant Let's! Revolution!, a beautifully animated tile-based roguelite that has a touch of Minesweeper about it. I highlighted it in our big demo rec list at the start of the week, but 150-odd words simply wasn't enough to really get across just how excellent this is. So indulge me a bit while I tell you more about it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[And it's only for Partners
Twitch is forever altering the way it allows content creators to make money, but it usually comes with a drawback or two. Take the recent changes to revenue splits. Some felt that this was a step in the right direction, but given that the new program comes with a bunch of boxes that need to be ticked, not everyone can benefit.
Now, there's a new feature that's being implemented, which could also be seen in a less-than-good light for most. According to a recent blog post, Twitch is introducing "Hype Chat," a feature that gives viewers the chance to literally buy chat messages. The idea behind it is to let users "stand out" in the overall chat.
[caption id="attachment_388337" align="aligncenter" width="572"] Image via Twitch.[/caption]
Amounts that can be paid for messages vary from $1 to $500 (though Twitch says that streamers can set a minimum amount up to $100). Depending on how much a viewer pays will depend on the duration of the pinned comment, as well as character length, and the visual design. All this while affording the person streaming the ability to "earn a share of the revenue from each Hype Chat purchase."
But, as usual, not everyone will get the benefit of this new feature. The blog post goes on to say that Hype Chat is only available to Partners, so smaller channels will miss out. However, the Amazon-owned service does say that it may look into implementing this "more broadly" in the future.
For some, though, it may be too little too late to win back support. With big streaming names like xQc and Amouranth already jumping ship to rival platform Kick, things are looking a bit tough for Twitch right now, though it should be noted that it is still pulling in millions of users each month.

Epic Games Store has revealed the next title that it will be offering up gratis to all of its users next week — So grab your sword and knapsack, as we're delving into the silly fantasy adventure of The Dungeon Of Naheulbeuk: The Amulet Of Chaos, which is available to download for free from June 29.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6o7m6XIq-k
Developed by Artefacts Studio and released in the fall of 2020, The Dungeon Of Naheulbeuk is a tactical RPG that features all of the castle-running, monster-slaying, loot-gathering action one would expect from the genre, but with far more comical and dopey thematic than the standard grimdark fare. Based on an audio series by French author John Lang, this adaptation has players guide a party of hapless heroes through a series of quests, winning the day because of, rather than in spite of, their clumsy nature.
If you're a fan of tactical role-playing action, or fantasy dungeon crawlers, and want to check out a fun twist on a familiar favorite, then be sure to bag yourself The Dungeon Of Naheulbeuk: The Amulet Of Chaos when it becomes free to download between June 29 - July 6. Before then, you still have the opportunity to pick up current freebie, immersive grim sim theHunter: Call of the Wild.

Sega has announced that Sonic Frontiers is getting a buffet of new features in celebration of Sonic’s 32nd Birthday. Not a big buffet, but it does feature New Game Plus, which I’m surprised it took this long to be added.
On top of New Game Plus, Sonic Frontiers is getting some goofy cosmetics, a special collectible Koco, new moves, and some new challenges. That’s all pretty groovy, but I don’t know what else to really say about them.
https://youtu.be/vAB_BG60APA
New Game Plus, I can certainly understand the value of. Sonic builds up his skills throughout the game. This will allow you to start over with all of those intact and just completely wreck house with a combination of too much power and experience. Both your skill tree and power-ups will carry over.
I should probably go back and finish Sonic Frontiers. I played it pre-release and fell off at maybe the 10-hour mark. I was covering it for guides, and everything in that game has its own dedicated tutorial. I also feel like, while I like Sonic the Hedgehog games (some of them), I have to be in a very specific mood to play them, and I’m kind of feeling that right now.
The Birthday Bash update is completely free to anyone who owns Sonic Frontiers, and is dropping today at 5:00 pm PST. If you don’t, it’s available on PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Switch, and PC.

This news comes from yesterday's court trial between Xbox (and Activision Blizzard) and the Federal Trade Commission over Microsoft's attempted acquisition of Activision Blizzard. Bond claimed in court that, in the leadup to the launch of the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S generation of hardware in 2020, Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick said his company did not intend to put Call of Duty – presumably new, upcoming ones – on the Xbox platform unless Microsoft shared more revenue.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not Forgotten
Guerilla Games has created a memorial within Horizon Forbidden West to Lance Reddick, who recently died on March 17, 2023. Reddick voiced Sylens in both the core game and its expansion, Burning Shores. This is as well as appearing in 2017’s Horizon: Zero Dawn.
The memorial for Reddick can be found within the Burning Shores expansion on the island where you first meet Seyka. If you start off on the area to the North of that island using a campfire on the beach (near the lava flow), you can fly directly south, across the straight, and onto a ridge. You might find it easiest to spot at night because the memorial itself is a bright blue hologram.
https://twitter.com/Guerrilla/status/1672213285712584704?s=20
Beyond memorable roles in film, such as Charon in the John Wick series, Reddick has been a voice in video games since 2009’s 50 Cent: Blood on the Sand. He had a prominent role in the Destiny series. After news of his death, Destiny 2 players gathered to pay respect.
The memorial is part of the latest update for Horizon: Forbidden West, and demonstrates how well-respected Lance Reddick was among those he worked with.
Horizon: Forbidden West and its Burning Shores expansion is available on PlayStation 5.

The update was announced in November 2022 as part of the game's 2023 roadmap.
The Sonic's Birthday Bash update adds new challenges, moves, and a new kind of collectible Koco for Sonic. The update also promises free birthday decorations for our hero, as well as the addition of New Game Plus. As is standard with most New Game Plus modes, you can begin the adventure from the start with all of your skill tree and power-up levels carried over into the new file.
Sonic's Birthday Bash arrives free to download beginning today at 5 p.m. PT / 8 p.m. ET. The first of three content updates arrived in March, adding a photo mode, Cyber Space Challenges, and Battle Rush mode, plus a jukebox featuring collectible songs from Sonic's past. The third update, which promises to be the most substantial, adds new playable characters and a new story and is set to arrive later this year.

Old-school cool developer Sunsoft has announced that it is planning a crowdfunding campaign in hopes to bring three of its Japan-only Famicom releases to modern platforms. The campaign will officially launch on the Japanese crowdfunding site Campfire between July 14 - August 31.
The three titles up for rerelease are Edo-set platformer Kanshaku Tamanage Kantarou no Toukaidou Gojuusan-tsugi (1986), side-scrolling fantasy adventure The Wing of Madoola (1986), and finally the casually-paced text adventure Ripple Island (1988). None of the titles ventured outside of Japan and thus have since faded into obscurity, a status that Sunsoft is hoping to revitalize.
[caption id="attachment_388355" align="alignnone" width="640"] Image from Shmuplations[/caption]
Should the Campfire campaign prove successful, the three titles will be ported to PC and Nintendo Switch. In addition, the publisher is hoping to release physical gold cartridges of the games for the Famicom platform. Way back when, Sunsoft was one of the few companies allowed to release its titles on specially branded cartridges, (see image above), and while many of the studio's games were awarded this prestige, gold-tinted cartridges were a goal never achieved by the studio. Hopefully, Sunsoft will be able to realize its glittery dream, if 40 years after the fact.
Localizations for the titles were not confirmed, and seem unlikely, but we will let you know should this change.

There was something a bit Advance Wars about the look and style about its burly lion pirate captain, but just, you know, in a high seas card battle kind of setting instead of dealing with sergeants, tanks and air support. But its Steam Next Fest demo has really sunk its teeth into me this week, offering up turn-based card duels that scratch exactly the same kind of itch as Inscryption did for me a couple of years ago.

As you might imagine, today's Sonic Central also shined a spotlight on the highly anticipated 2D Sonic game. We received a new trailer that showed off some new DLC coming to Sonic Superstars that features a collaboration with the Lego brand.
Players will be able to download a free Lego Sonic DLC skin to give the Blue Blur a new, bricky look. In addition, those who preorder Sonic Superstars will receive a Lego Eggman skin as well. You can see the new trailer below.


While Sonic is a recent addition to the Lego stable of characters, he appeared in the 2015 toys-to-life game Lego Dimensions, where he received specialized stages geared towards the speedy playstyle. However, it wasn't until 2021 that Lego officially greenlit a fan creation featuring Green Hill Zone from Sonic Mania. Then, earlier this year, Lego announced four new Sonic the Hedgehog Lego sets, which will be available in August.
Sonic Superstars arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC later this year. For more, check out our hands-on preview right here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Depends on your definition of "fishing"
If you were hoping to be able to whip out your rod and catch some alien fish in Starfield, there's bad news on that front. Todd Howard himself has confirmed that fishing won't be a feature in Bethesda's upcoming RPG.
In the latest episode of the Kinda Funny Xcast, Howard is asked a bunch of questions regarding the game. About 14 minutes in, he's asked whether there's going to be any "space fishing" in Starfield. Howard begins his answer by saying that it "depends on your definition of 'fishing'," curious as to whether it refers to the collecting or killing of fish.
https://youtu.be/AIbnDyv6g1c?t=880
Co-host Gary then gets more specific by asking whether he'll be able to have "some kind of rod" that can be put into a lake in order to retrieve a fish. Howard then crushes Gary's (and probably other people's) hopes by confirming that the game does not have that feature. However, this does open up the possibility of it being including in an update, expansion, or even something modders could implement.
As we know, Skyrim was given a fishing feature for the Anniversary Edition that dropped in November 2021. Given this, it's not too far-fetched to consider that Bethesda may add this peaceful hobby to Starfield at some point in the future. But that's just speculation on our part.
When it comes to open world games, players like to take a step back from the action for a bit. The chance to do a spot of fishing while exploring an alien world sounds appealing, so it's a bit of a shame that Starfield won't have it on release.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am having an absolute riot playing Killer Frequency. It’s a first-person puzzle horror where you're trying to help folks escape a rampaging murderer. Usually, when I read a game description like that, I’m already grabbing my cushion to hide behind and readying my cute puppy compilation video on a second screen, but Team17 have heavily leaned into the campy side of slasher horror with humour serving as the perfect buffer. No safety cushion or puppies needed here, folks. 
Here’s the set-up: You’re playing as Forrest Nash, a big-time radio DJ who has found himself stuck in Small Town, Nowhere, USA. While you're working as the host for the town’s local station, it turns out the police chief has only gone and gotten themselves stabbed by a serial killer. With them out of action, you’re roped into acting as a stand-in 911 operator - and with the murderer still on the loose and ready to strike again, that line is going to be pretty busy.

The injunction would further prevent Microsoft's acquisition deal of Activision Blizzard from going through. 

Several of Xbox's high profile figures testified at the first day of trial, including the likes of Sarah Bond, corporate vice president of gaming partnerships and business development at Microsoft, Bethesda head of publishing Pete Hines, and Xbox Game Studios head Matt Booty. They were questioned on a range of things including cloud gaming, Call Of Duty exclusivity, and Bobby Kotick's revenue share demands.

Like, sure, you could attach the horror tag to it on Steam if you wanted, but it's more of a costume for you to enjoy - like the family down the street who are really into Halloween and turn their suburban semi into a haunted house with a movie-quality zombie in the front yard. It's really cool and you like it on its own terms, but being frightened isn't so much the point as it is to remember you have enjoyed being frightened in the past. Also, for some reason the family won't let you out of the living room until you complete a logic puzzle involving maths.

Just don't expect it within six months. Or before 2024, actually.

Finally, Marcus and Charles talk about Dordogne, a great water-colored narrative adventure, and Stray Gods, a neat roleplaying musical game.

Then a character opens their mouth, and the dialogue and how it’s delivered is so cringeworthy that you’re ready to jump ship. Sometimes that’s bad writing. But when we’re talking about a game from a different part of the world, it’s just as likely that questionable localization is the culprit. 
Localization and translation are difficult. Doing it exceptionally well is exceedingly difficult. Often, minute cultural differences in how storytelling is delivered in different places can add up; in the aggregate, those minor differences can alienate players from another region. Another contributing complexity is the way that language, facial expressions, and…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bethesda's Indiana Jones game, which is currently being developed by Wolfenstein developer Machine Games, will be exclusive to Xbox. 
This news comes from an ongoing court trial between the Federal Trade Commission and Xbox (and Activision Blizzard, which Microsoft is trying to acquire) happening today, which is where Bethesda's Head of Publishing Pete Hines revealed the game will be a console exclusive on Xbox, as reported by IGN. Like Xbox's other first-party releases, Machine Games' Indiana Jones game will also come to PC. 
However, Hines also revealed that Disney and Bethesda parent company ZeniMax originally signed an agreement that this Indiana Jones game would be multiplatform, meaning it'd likely also release on PlayStation. Hines says after Microsoft acquired ZeniMax in 2020, the agreement with Disney was amended to transition the Indiana Jones game away from a multiplatform release and instead, into one that will release exclusively on Xbox and PC.


Today's court trial also revealed that Xbox head Phil Spencer told Hines that Bethesda should look at title exclusivity on a case-by-case basis, IGN reports. As for why Indiana Jones was transitioned into an exclusive, Hines cited "reducing risk and trying to get a degree of clarity." 
"You're dealing with a licensor who is giving a ton of feedback on what you're making, is going to add a ton of time to your scheduling, these agreements, you don't get to take as long as you want, you have a window of time in which you're going to release a game, you immediately have a clock that's ticking on you," Hines said, according to IGN.
Bethesda revealed Machine Games' Indiana Jones game back in 2021 with a short teaser trailer, and that was the last we've seen of it. However, Bethesda head Todd Howard says he first pitched this Indiana Jones game way back in 2009. There's still no release window for the game today.

I really enjoyed my time with it, giving it an 8.5 out of 10 in the official Game Informer review (which you can read here). From its explosive story to its fast-paced and robust combat, it’s a treat for any Final Fantasy fan, especially those looking for an extra dose of action. However, it’s still a Final Fantasy, meaning there are dozens of hours of content to experience, from the main story to the side quests, hunts, and more. 
With FFXVI now behind me after more than 65 hours (although I’m still tinkering with the idea of getting the Platinum trophy for it on PlayStation 5), I’m excited to share with you 10 tips and tricks I think you should know before getting started in FFXVI.

It apparently helps to crib the mining, mineral hoarding, and maladroit approach to industrial safety that makes source material Deep Rock Galactic one of the best FPS games going.
Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor is in the works at Funday Games, not original DRG devs and fellow Danish outfit Ghost Ship Games. But it does fall under the latter’s new publishing arm, Ghost Ship Publishing, and can trace its origins back to a casual meeting between Funday co-founder Anders Leicht Rohde and Ghost Ship CEO Søren Lundgaard – and beyond.

At best, studios reimagine classic experiences in exciting new ways, sand away rough edges, and somehow retain the intangible x-factors that made fans fall in love with these titles in the first place. At the very least, remakes offer a great way to play antiquated or less accessible experiences on modern hardware. 
The remake boom has been in full swing in recent years to the point that it’s starting to get tough to keep track of all the projects in the works.

The name change does imply a broader expansion into more than just games, but it's obviously a bit of a wait and see kind of situation until EA show off something that isn't a video game.

It's an adaptation on one of Toriyama's lesser-known mangas, which features a band of misfits who aim to right the wrongs of a king who's hogged the desert's vital water supply. I got to play it for all of 20 minutes, in a demo that was as stripped back as a grated cactus. Still, I got to sample a bit of roaming about in a tank, one brief stop at a town, an opening of one (1) chest, and some fighting. It seemed okay, I guess? But my main worry is whether its desert is interesting enough to hold people's attention.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft have announced they're raising the price of Game Pass, but PC players don't need to worry too much about it (for now, at least). As reported by The Verge, come July 6th, Xbox Game Pass will be going up from £8/ $9 a month to £9/ $11, and Game Pass Ultimate will increase from £11/ $15 a month to £13/ $17. If you're just a PC player though, you've got nothing to worry about, as Microsoft hasn't announced any changes for PC Game Pass at this point in time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Horses are trotting their way into The Sims 4 as part of the game's next expansion, with leaks sharing some specific details ahead of its full reveal. The official Sims Twitter account did show a short teaser trailer earlier this week of a Sim imagining a life out in the desert, promising a "rootin' tootin' expansion, two bold kits," and a Behind the Sims presentation. You can check out the full trailer for that when it debuts later today, but leaks regarding the expansion were shared on the Sims Community fan site after details and screenshots were mistakenly shared on Steam earlier this week.

And one of the main reasons I enjoyed my 65+ hours with it was the combat. It’s fast-paced and bombastic and continues to grow more and more robust as you play through the game’s story. 
However, it can be difficult. As someone with dozens of hours in the game (and still playing more as I stretch into its endgame content) and a pretty good handle on FFXVI’s combat, I’m here to help with that! Here are 10 tips and tricks to help you dominate the battlefield in FFXVI.

The match was too close to call – 1990 to 1995 – but I wasn't keeping track. All that stood between my team and victory was a chubby crocodile with a vacuum. I danced and jumped around him as he used his big belly and Luigi's Mansion-like hoover to bounce me around like a loose piece of cat fluff. I just needed a few moments to deposit my Wumpa Fruit, and victory would be ours. I had my blinders on, and that was a mistake. The enemy team's Wumpa Fruit meter quickly filled to 2000, and the match was over. My…]]></summary>

The controller looks phenomenal, but it does cost a fair bit - so I thought it was worth letting you know that the early adopter tax has been lifted, and the controller is now down to £65. 
That's still fairly expensive, but given that this controller seems destined to sell out - as it has done in the US - then I thought it was worth bringing up regardless.

Given all the abject suffering that the game and its predecessors make their stock and trade, it was an especially nice surprise to see real, genuine positivity emerge out of the literal hellscape of Sanctuary.

That makes it a cheaper alternative to their PCIe 4.0 drives with DRAM, but still more than fast enough for PC gaming. Therefore, it's worth knowing that the 1TB 980 is now available for less than £40 at Amazon, a £16 reduction from its usual price and less than half the cost it debuted at back in 2021.

In childish, whimsical fashion as a childish, whimsical child, I grab my pair of chopsticks and start hitting them together as if I'm a drummer. "Olivia, don't do that," my mum scolds me. "Your grandma always used to tell me off when I did that as a child." Sullenly, I put the chopsticks back down on the table.

Well, 10 year old me, you're in for a treat. If you wait a couple of decades, you'll learn of Nour: Play With Your Food, a game which allows you to bang together chopsticks. The game wants you to.

Arriving on October 24, this package is headlined by its HD remasters of Metal Gear Solid (including the VR/Special missions), Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, and Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater. However, it also includes Metal Gear (both the NES and MSX versions), Snake’s Revenge, and Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake.


Bonus content includes strategy guides for each game, the Metal Gear Solid 1 and 2 digital graphic novels, screenplay and master books, and a digital soundtrack.

During today's Nintendo Direct, we got our first details on Wave 5 of the Booster Course Pass DLC, which is set to hit within the next couple of months.
Booster Course Pass Wave 5 will feature an all-new course in the bathroom-themed Squeaky Clean Sprint, as well as three new characters. Petey Piranha, who made his debut in Mario Kart: Double Dash; Wiggler, who debuted in Mario Kart 7; and Kamek, who appears in Mario Kart Tour (and was a character in Mario Kart 64 before being replaced by Donkey Kong in the retail version) are all set to join the roster of playable racers in this wave of DLC. Seven more courses will join the pack as well, but we have no indication of which tracks those will be just yet. You can see the announcement trailer below.


Wave 5 of the Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Booster Course Pass arrives this summer. The Booster Course Pass is included as a part of the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription plan, or you can buy the DLC pack itself for $25.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Star Ocean: The Second Story is getting an HD-2D overhaul that slaps the letter R at the end of the title, a nod to the fact that it’s a remake.
The game first launched for PlayStation in 1998 (1999 in the U.S.) and stars protagonists Claude, a human federation officer, and Rena, a mystically powered girl, who players choose to control in separate campaigns. The game heavily emphasizes decision-making as your choices determine which of many playable allies you meet along the way join your party. 


This enhanced remake includes a modernized version of the game’s real-time combat; players can now stun enemies with chain attacks. Another cool addition is that party members not in combat can still lend a hand by executing assist-style follow-up attacks.
Star Ocean The Second Story R launches November 2 for PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom arrived on May 12, its launch was accompanied by an Amiibo of Link. But Link was far from the only star of Nintendo's most popular game of 2023. During today's Nintendo Direct, the company announced the two other stars, Zelda and Ganondorf, are also set to receive Amiibo figures.
While the Tears of the Kingdom Link Amiibo is somewhat disappointing in its functionality (mostly the same as its Breath of the Wild counterpart), it provides special fabric for Link's paraglider. It appears as though fans should expect similar functionality from the upcoming Zelda and Ganondorf Amiibo figures, as the press release promises "valuable in-game items, as well as special fabric for the paraglider." 
The Tears of the Kingdom Zelda and Ganondorf Amiibo figures arrive later this holiday season. For more on what each Amiibo in the Legend of Zelda series does within The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, check out our Amiibo guide here.

This brand-new adventure sports a revamped art style (and more expressive characters) and stars the familiar foursome of Mario, Luigi, Peach, and Toad in addition to Daisy and Yoshi.


The 2D worlds sport trippy features caused by a new power-up called the Wonder Flower. This transforms the world and gameplay in unexpected ways; pipes come to life, Mario can stretch his body to absurd lengths, and hordes of stampeding rhinos can appear, among other wacky effects. The biggest gasp came from a new power-up that transformed Mario into an elephant. Yes, you read that right. Mario's an elephant now, and it looks delightfully ridiculous.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo and Rocksteady have revealed Batman: Arkham Trilogy, a new trilogy collection that brings Batman: Arkham Asylum, Arkham City, and Arkham Knight to Switch later this year. 
More specifically, the Arkham Trilogy is due out this fall and promises to allow players to experience "the definitive versions of Rocksteady's Arkham Trilogy games." This trilogy also includes all post-launch content, including DLC expansions, suits, Batmobiles, and more. All three of these games have been available elsewhere for years but this trilogy marks the first time Switch players can play through all three games. 
Check out Batman: Arkham Trilogy in the reveal trailer below: 


Unfortunately, this trilogy does not include the (pretty great) Batman: Arkham Origins, which wasn't developed by Rocksteady; it was developed by Gotham Knights developer WB Games Montreal. However, the three games in this trilogy are still great, so it's still a good get for the Switch platform.]]></summary>

The company revealed this during today's Nintendo Direct, highlighting the unique ways players can use two Joy-Con (and body movement) to complete microgames. One example shows a player using Joy-Con to balance Mario sliding in Super Mario 64. There's also plenty of first-person Wario action as well, with one microgame showing Wario trying to break out of what appears to be a jail cell. 


As you'd expect, WarioWare: Move It features a very unique, albeit strange, art style. Plus, it features two-player local co-op and a special Party Mode that allows up to four players to play various microgames together.

"In this 3D platforming adventure, you’ll explore the bright and colorful world of Macaroon, and help Penny and Yo-Yo escape the clutches of the grouchy Emperor Eddie.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pikmin 4 is right around the corner, but that didn't stop Nintendo from flooding us with new information about the game during today's Nintendo Direct. From a new underground area, to night expeditions, to a new demo out next week, here's everything you need to know about Pikmin 4.


The main draw in the newest game in the Pikmin series is Oatchi, a dog-like companion that assists you and your Pikmin as you try to survive the cute and hostile alien world. In addition to helping out with lifting and pushing items, you and your Pikmin can ride him across land and water. You'll also be able to upgrade his abilities over time, increasing the amount of damage he does, the number of Pikmin he can carry, or the total weight of objects he can push.
You'll need those upgraded abilities to explore Pikmin 4's new underground areas, which appear to be more heavily centered around contraption-based puzzles. With more treasures and new enemies, it's a lot less open than the aboveground portions, but should provide an interesting challenge.
Finally, Pikmin 4 marks the first time in the series your explorer will be able to go on nighttime expeditions. Wild creatures are in a frenzy, making them much more dangerous, but you'll have the help of the new Glow Pikmin, a species only out at night. Instead of throwing them one by one, you can focus them into one glowing energy ball to release all at once, doing huge amounts of damage.
If you want to try it for yourself, a demo for Pikmin 4 will be available on the Nintendo eShop on June 28. The full game will be released one month from today, on July 21. For more on the game, check out the recent trailer that reveals you can customize your explorer, or download Pikmin 1 and 2 on your Switch right now.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Persona 5 Tactica was announced recently through the Xbox Games Showcase, but details on gameplay were limited. Today’s Nintendo Direct brought us a closer look at the game while highlighting the project's appearance on Switch consoles.
In the game, the group from Persona 5 is pulled into a new world, where they join forces with a new character named Erina, who is fighting as a revolutionary against the prevailing power in that place.
Gameplay allows for both up-close and ranged attacks over the course of its turn-based tactics encounters, but you can also use Personas to get your point across. Knocking enemies down opens up the “One More” action to double up damage. The game also encourages canny positioning choices, since surrounding your foes with three characters opens up the “Triple Threat” ability to deal big damage.
Drawing from the capability seen in Persona 5, you can also fuse Personas to create new ones.
Persona 5 Tactica is coming to PlayStation and Xbox consoles, as well as Switch, on November 17.]]></summary>

We control Peach in a 3D world that looks reminiscent of something we'd see in a Super Mario RPG.
One interesting thing the Direct did reveal was that when Peach steps on a special pedestal, her outfit changes, going from her usual pink dress to a bright, light blue dress that seems to indicate she's powered up in some way. But the reveal ends there, with Nintendo promising more information at a later date. The last game to star Peach as the main character was 2005's Super Princess Peach for DS.]]></summary>

Today changed that, as the Nintendo Direct showed off in-game footage for the very first time. Check it out for yourself below.


Titled “The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero,” this DLC comes in two waves. The Teal Mask is slated for this fall, while The Indigo Disk will come this winter. The first expansion will be available to play as soon as the player begins the treasure hunt, which happens a few hours into the game. Meanwhile, The Indigo Disk will require you to complete the entirety of the main story plus the previous expansion.
The first of the two expansions, The Teal Mask, will bring trainers to the land of Kitakami, an area completely distinct from the Paldea region they were born in. The adventure takes place during some kind of festival, and players will be tasked with unraveling mysteries tied to the local folklore. Part two, The Indigo Disk, takes place at Blueberry Academy, a school similar to Naranja and Uva Academy. As an exchange student, you’ll get to take classes, interact with students, and participate in the school’s battle-focused curriculum.
While the trailers didn't provide any major new announcements, we got another look at Pokémon we already knew about, like Okidogi, Munkidori, and Fezandipiti in the Teal Mask and Terapagos in The Indigo Disk. There are also new looks at the DLC's exclusive characters Carmine and Kieran.
No specific dates were announced today, but The Teal Mask will still be released this Fall, while the Indigo Disk will be released sometime this winter.]]></summary>

Final Fantasy XVI is bombastic, indulgent, and extreme, breaking far beyond the limits of what I thought an action-oriented Final Fantasy could pull off. It represents a pivotal shift for the series, ditching any semblance of turn-based move selection, active-time battles, or anything else in its history in favor of a fast-paced, extravagant, combo-heavy combat system that continued to grow more robust throughout my 60-plus hour journey. 
There’s a linear action game in FFXVI, and it’s the highlight of the experience. But standard RPG tropes, mechanics, …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's no secret that I love Dorfromantik. It opened my eyes to the world of tile-based puzzler strategy games, and I've looked out for similar ones ever since. Thankfully for me, there's been a fair few riffs on Dorformantik's formula recently - a focus on nature, a soothing soundtrack, and some good old puzzling. Growth is one of these, and I'm hooked on the demo that's playable as part of Steam Next Fest. Taking place on a hexagonal grid, the aim is to uncover the map using a range of wildlife, fertilising the land in the process. Each tile you reveal gives you points, and you'll have to navigate around mountains, water, and special landmarks.

From what Manuel Bronstein, Roblox's Chief Product Officer, shared in an official blog post yesterday, it seems that it'll be on creators to label their experiences as mature, which "may contain more violence, blood, or crude humour" than usual experiences.
The introduction of age appropriate access is not for safety primarily, as Roblox say they want to "simulate and even go beyond what's possible in the real world". Bronstein also added that, "We want to replicate that dynamic on Roblox," referring to the idea of getting older and legally being allowed to enter places such as nightclubs.

We've highlighted a few UK RTX 3060 Ti deals before, but here's one for the US market courtesy of Best Buy - on a PNY unit with a simple dual-fan design, plenty of cooling potential and a price that makes a lot of sense: $275, down from a previous price of $320 and considerably less than the $399 Nvidia is asking for their 4060 Ti FE.

This makes it a better time to buy this particular item than times when it is more expensive, generally speaking. 
The specifics are as follows: the Sapphire Pulse Radeon RX 7900 XTX has been discounted from $1000 to $900 in the US (tick the $100 code on the product page), while Sapphire's AMD reference design has dropped from £1099 to £949 in the UK (no ticking required).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Immortals Of Aveum is a magic-fisted first-person shooter with a name that reminds me, every time, of another EA-published fantasy game, Kingdoms Of Amalur. I can't tell if that's a good thing or not. 

I can tell that Immortals Of Aveum has been delayed. Aveum had been aiming for a July 20th release, but has now been pushed back a month until August 22nd.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Immortals of Aveum was revealed with a short teaser trailer at the 2022 Game Awards. The implication of the teaser was that it was a game in early development, which is why it was a surprise when the game was revealed to be releasing July 20, 2023. That release date has now slipped, but only be a few weeks. It is now launching a month and a couple of days later, on August 22.
You can find the full delay statement, signed by developer Ascendant Studios and the game's director, Bret Robbins, below.
As you know, this is our first game as a self-funded independent studio. We set out five years ago to ambitiously make an original Magic FPS in a new fantasy world. Along the way, we worked through a pandemic, built a new team, developed on Unreal Engine 5.1 and pushed the boundaries of what we thought was possible. Now, the finish line is in sight.
The recent feedback to the game proves to us what we already felt: that Immortals of Aveum is something special. In order to realize our full vision, we are going to take a few extra weeks, making our new launch date Tuesday, August 22nd. This will give us time to further polish the game, finish optimizing all platforms, and deliver a strong launch. We owe it to ourselves and to you to get this right.
For more on Immortals of Aveum's delay, you can find an official blog post here. For some of our positive hands-on impressions of the game, head here.]]></summary>

But because it makes incredibly difficult, obtuse games, such as the Soulsborne titles, defined by their challenge and willingness to go against common game design philosophies. From Software reached a critical and commercial apex in 2022 when it released Elden Ring, its most popular game to date by a large margin. And now that it's become a household name in the gaming world, the studio is going back to its roots.
Early in June, we flew out to Tokyo, Japan, to visit From Software to be the first people in the world to see Armored Core VI Fires of Rubicon. While the AC series has been with From for its entire history as a game developer, …]]></summary>

This guide is keeping separate from the best Steam Deck microSD card list, mainly because a good microSD card is less of an accessory and more of a core essential (especially if you’ve gone for the 64GB Steam Deck model). Still, this guide will cover an array of addons, from alternative cases to thumbstick covers and USB-C docking stations.

Initially revealed on stage during Sony's 2014 E3 press conference, Dead Island 2 had an infamously rocky road to release. What briefly began in the early 2010s at Techland, the developer behind the first Dead Island and similar open-world zombie game Dying Light, then moved to Yager Development, then Sumo Digital, and then finally, Deep Silver's Dambuster Studio, was for many years a giant question mark in the game industry. Its publisher, Deep Silver, spent many of those years saying little to nothing about the game other than vague confirmations that it was still in development. Until it resurfaced in late 2022, a seeming sign that Dead Island 2 would see the light of day – which i…]]></summary>

June 20, 2023
While Nintendo's presence was typically a given back when E3 was still around, its relative silence over the last month left many to doubt whether or not there would be a summer showcase at all. The company's Twitter account has also been the source of a scattered handful of announcements lately, posting everything from new Joy-Con colors to a sequel to 1-2 Switch to a new trailer for Pikmin 4. Still, Nintendo has plenty to announce, whether it's something we expect (like Metroid Prime 4) or something entirely new.
We'll find out for ourselves at the livestream tomorrow.

I had grumpily asked if he could pick me and a friend up from a local park one afternoon, and he remembers us bundling into the back of his car all smelly and sweaty and terrible as teenagers so often are. But as he pulled away, he caught a snippet of our conversation that was so unusual it's the reason this seemingly normal car ride has cemented itself as a core memory. We were talking about the price of eggs. And tomatoes. And the order in which we were planting crops to ensure the greatest yield.


My poor father interrupted us, turning in his seat to ask what the hell we were talking about. “It’s a game we’re both playing called Harvest Moon” I scoffed in his direction. “You wouldn’t understand”.

As spotted by TheGamer, fans who have got their hands on copies of the game early, such as YouTuber belmont gr, are reporting that the Game Gear games sound off, like there's some kind of echo effect.

Rightsholders could collaborate more intensely with app stores, for example. Meanwhile, app platforms could implement know-your-customer verification, while deploying automated tools to scan for and filter apps that use known pirate keywords.

I got to chat with principal designer Sandro Sammarco last week, and he told me they've been hard at work making sure it's "filled with loads of cool new stuff that people really haven't seen before". He also said that their partnership with Games Workshop has allowed them to "really go to town in terms of the visuals, the lore, [and] the story that we're telling", and he hopes that the way they've characterised the campaign's principal faction, the Stormcast Eternals, will give players plenty to sink their teeth into when it launches in full.

This week is another shortie because Twitter is once again broken and refusing to show all the weekend's posts, which sure feels ominous for the social media platform. The games are still good. Come on in for an immersive sim with a clever little technology trick, an adventure game set in a city on a giant octopus, the throwing of an egg, and more attractive and interesting indie games.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the same way that Alien: Isolation is, for many, now the definitive Ridley Scott’s Alien game, I’ve got no problem getting all ‘game critic who wants to feel important by making wild declarative statements’ and saying that Aliens: Dark Descent is now, for me at least, the definitive James Cameron’s Aliens game. It’s the first to really capture the white-knuckle vibe of setting up perimeters, quipping out that last line of top-tier banter you’ve been saving, and seeing the shapes on the motion tracker creep closer and squeal louder. It really does do the license justice, so if that’s what you’re looking for, dig in. I just wish it trusted me to be able to count higher than one. Not that much higher, either. Just four.
Dark Descent is not a game for strategy game fans nearly as much as it’s one for Aliens fans. You order your entire squad around at the same time, pausing or slowing time to issue commands like grenades or suppressive fire, using a stock of command points that refill over time. It’s a game that’s (rightly) decided that a very particular type of strategy game is the best format to convey Aliens’ whole schtick, but then seems to have realised, hang on, we’re at risk of (alien) isolating and possibly even (alien)ating a lot of potential customers here. What if there was a way to do XCOM but without all the knobbly bits?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One mistake I often see novice PC builders making is overspending on the motherboard. It's true that higher-end models offer more features and can support better overclocking performance, but for the vast majority of people you're better off putting your budget towards the highest-tier graphics card and processor you can afford - as these actually determine in-game performance! - then slotting in the cheapest motherboard that gets decent reviews and supports your components. 
One excellent example of just such a motherboard is the Gigabyte B760M Gaming X DDR4, a simple option that supports 12th/13th-gen Intel processors all the way up to the 13900K. With an asking price of just £116 right now, you can pick up this plus a cheap 16GB DDR4 RAM kit for just £152, letting you spend the vast majority of your PC budget where it really matters.

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2023/06/19/hideo-kojima-wont-direct-the-death-stranding-movie-but-he-is-deeply-involved"/>
        <updated>2023-06-19T15:54:41.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last December, Deadline reported that a Death Stranding movie was in the works. Kojima Productions, the studio that made the original game, was set to be one of two main producers, but there was no word on who would write, direct, or star in the film, or if any members of the original creative team would occupy any of those roles. Yesterday, Death Stranding's game director Hideo Kojima took to Twitter to clarify his involvement.
Just to be clear, I am deeply involved in producing, supervising, plotting, look, design and content of the film adaptation of DS, just not in charge of directing.
June 18, 2023
Here, Kojima confirms that he will not be directing the movie, but fans worried that Kojima Productions' involvement wouldn't involve input from the man at its helm can rest easy. In addition to his role as producer, Kojima will be "deeply involved" with many other elements of the film, including its plot and overall aesthetics. While the movie takes place in the existing Death Stranding world, it will "introduce new elements and characters within the Death Stranding universe," according to Deadline. Whether that consists of a retelling of an existing plot or an entirely new one is unclear, but it will certainly have that distinct Kojima touch.
In addition to the film-focused branch of Kojima Productions, the film will be produced by Hammerstone Studios. Founded in 2018, the studio's best-known films include Barbarian (2022) and Bill and Ted Face the Music (2020). The studio's founder, Alex Lebovici, had the following to say to Deadline about the upcoming project:
Given the fact that the production teams have yet to announce any director, writer or actor that's attached to the project (I'm hoping it involves Nicolas Cage), it's still a few years out. If you're dying for more Kojima before then, you can re-watch the Death Stranding 2 reveal trailer or fantasize about the game Kojima wants to make in space.]]></summary>

It's a top-down roguelike shooter that does everything right, and seldom have I seen a game more deserving of its Overwhelmingly Positive rating on Steam.

The cats wound up waiting outside while they worked on other things, but we now have a much more concrete idea of what the game is.
The developers have actually been posting extensive development updates since January, but McMillen also just recorded an adhoc TikTok video where he points his phone at his screen. Turns out Mewgenics is a turn-based strategy roguelike with wizard cats who can cut their paws while opening windows. Could be worth the wait!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Super Replay returns, and we're checking out Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts! Join us today on Twitch at 2:00 p.m. Central as we kick of the adventure, which will continue each week until we roll credits. We'll also have every episode available the next day on our Game Informer Shows YouTube Channel (or you can watch the videos in the above playlist). 
Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts was released for the Xbox 360 on November 11, 2008. The third (and, so far, final) entry in Rare's beloved platforming series centers on vehicle creation, where players collect and slap together hundreds of parts to assemble their own wacky contraptions to explore. The bevy of possible combinations and emphasis on player choice and creativity was largely unprecedented at the time, paving the way for future games such as the upcoming The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. However, this direction would divide fans due to how much it strays from the traditional Banjo formula. So where will I land on it? Let's find out.
Join me, Marcus Stewart, alongside Kyle Hilliard as we explore one of the Xbox 360's biggest hidden gems to see whether it holds up or falls apart like a poorly constructed doohickey.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Look at any image of heavy metal horror game The Axis Unseen and you’ll recognise an archetype: the stealth archer. For a certain sort of Elder Scrolls player, it’s the only way to travel through a fantasy open world - perma-crouched, bow stretched lazily across the lower third of the screen. And it’s an appeal that creator Nate Purkeypile understands perfectly, having spent the larger portion of his career working on Bethesda’s RPGs, from Fallout 3 and Skyrim all the way through to Fallout 76.
“It’s probably not the best idea for most people to do a solo open world,” he says. “But at the same time, this is like my sixth one. I’m pretty sure what goes into these.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A decent name is one thing, but one like To Hell With The Ugly plain demands to be looked up. That's when you see the striking art style, and yeah okay, I'm already on on board.
Based on a French novel by Boris Vian, this tells a strange and surprisingly dark story about a famously handsome young himbo who gets caught up in a sinister plot in 1950s Los Angeles and has to adventure, talk, fight, and - horrors - reason his way to the truth. It's an adventure game with quick-time event bits, and a 50s America setting, all of which could put me off it entirely, but I can't bring myself to say anything bad about it at all.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Curious players can get their hands on Embark Studios’ ARC Raiders for the first time via a closed alpha later this month. 
On June 29, the PvPvE extraction shooter will get its first test out in the wild, so to speak. You’ll have to sign up on Steam to participate in the alpha, and a new trailer provides some fresh (pre-alpha) gameplay clips. 


ARC Raiders made its big debut at The Game Awards in 2021 and was originally pitched as a co-op PvE experience about players working together to battle invading alien machines. It had been slated to launch last year before Embark delayed the game in order to focus on finishing up its other upcoming free-to-play team shooter, The Finals (which has a second playable beta running now until June 21). Last month, Embark broke the news that it changed ARC Raiders into a more PvP-focused extraction experience, as now teams of players combat each other to retrieve resources in addition to fighting the enemy machines. 
Embark Studios has not given a release window for ARC Raiders, but they plan to launch it on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.]]></summary>

Did 2020's summer of gaming ever end? It did not. It is a constant. Like the stars in the sky or the ocean blue. Geoff is here. He has a game to show you. It's probably a horror game set in space. Doesn't that look great? Now let's take a look at the first game by a new studio comprised of ex-Bioware devs.


Yep, that's right. Not-E3 2023 is over (I think?) and once again I've commanded team RPS to dig their microphones out of storage before forcing them to tell me about their favourite game from the cavalcade of directs, showcases and presentations that have replaced my once beloved E3 weekend.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You know me, folks: I love management sims, and I love people in physical distress. Wasn't I only delighted, then, to play a bit of Galacticare, an upcoming hospital management sim in the same sticky vein as the hospitals Theme or Two Point. The twist? These hopsitals are in space! Like those managment games, your task is to build a hospital that runs as smooth as some kind of alien baby's bottom (the alien probably has tentacles), where you want to treat people and prevent them from dying as much as possible, but largely because death is bad for your profit margin more than any altruistic impulse. I mean you can be altruistic if you want, I suppose, but if you run out of money it's harder to build more weird bone-fixing machines.
The tone - though Galacticare has strange diseases like being eaten from the inside out by a singularity, and wacky treatments including a sort of laser disco machine - is actually much closer to kind of satire-ish hijinks of spacestation management game Startopia than I had expected, thanks in part to the extremely dry AI helper offering input, and the many alien species who'll come to you for treatment.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rockstar Games co-founder Dan Houser has announced Absurd Ventures, his new studio. 
Houser was Rockstar's vice president when he announced in 2020 that he was leaving the company behind franchises like Red Dead Redemption and Grand Theft Auto. At the time of the announcement, Houser revealed that he had taken an extended break starting in the spring of 2019. His last day at Rockstar, which he co-founded with his brother Sam Houser in 1998, was March 11. 
Now, three years later, Houser has revealed Absurd Ventures. This studio is focused on "building narrative worlds, creating characters, and writing stories for a diverse variety of genres, without regard to medium, to be produced for live-action and animation; video games and other interactive content, books, graphic novels, and scripted podcasts."


It sounds quite ambitious and while Absurd Venture's official website features all kinds of visuals showcasing its style, there's nothing official in terms of projects announced at this time.

Unlike Carn's Barbarian, Quin69's Druid wasn't level 100 yet, but he was pretty darn close at level 91. His Druid had 172 hours and 50 minutes of play time. That's more than a week's worth of playing and the game's only been out for 10 days (or 15, if we're including early access).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Memory can be a fickle thing. For thirty-something Mimi, everything before her thirteenth birthday is a blank. What happened before that point is never really interrogated during Dordogne's three-hour run time, but we do know her father is a stubborn old goat who cut ties with Mimi's really quite nice grandmother Nora after a summer she spent there as a shy, sheltered twelve-year-old. It's this summer that seems to be the cork in Mimi's memory bottle, and it's also the window in which Dordogne frames its sweet, coming of age tale. As Mimi in the present comes to terms with her grandmother's recent passing, the objects she finds in Nora's now-empty summer house trigger important flashbacks to that golden summer, and maybe also the answer to Mimi's apparent amnesia. Dordogne never demands very much of you during these sequences, but it does know how to luxuriate in life's little details, and find pleasure in a more leisurely lifestyle.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Immortals Of Aveum is EA and Ascendant Studio's upcoming first-person shooter where, instead of propelling metal at high speeds, you're slinging magic with your hands. We got another good look at said magic slinging at this year's Summer Game Fest, which has seemingly resulted in several reports of it being like a wizardy Call Of Duty. But having played a 30 minute demo of it this week, I reckon it's nothing like COD at all, really. Instead, it's more like Doom / your other retro shooter of choice, but one that carries itself with a frightening seriousness. Sometimes, that's fine. There have been plenty of these smaller sorts of blockbusters that have successfully struck the right balance of silly to serious, with the best ascending to a place of endearment. But so far, Immortals Of Aveum hasn't filled me with hope that it'll join the likes of Psi-Ops: The Mindgate Conspiracy, or like, The Darkness, as a twinkling beacon of silly fun.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As I write this many of the development team and other members of the community are busy having fun at a meet-up in Brussels. Not me though, I’m stuck here doing a release. We’ve been busy refactoring quite a lot of the underlying code to make future changes easier, but along the way we’ve found and fixed a few more bugs and quality of life improvements that we figured were worth releasing sooner than whenever 14.0 comes along. Notably, OpenTTD will now automatically disable hardware acceleration if it detects that the last crash happened while initialising the graphics driver. While hardware acceleration works well for the vast majority of people, it causes crashes for people that then required command line arguments or manual config file editing to get it to work. This should be a better solution for those users. Additionally, there is a change to the default mouse mode on Linux to improve experience when dragging the map (and often to match expected behaviour in other games). As always, there are plenty of other bugfixes, which you can find in the changelog. While you’re at it, have you seen the post about the upcoming addition of a automated opt-in survey to OpenTTD 14? If you have opinions, we’d like to hear them! Details here. Download Changelog Bug tracker]]></summary>

The ScummVM Team is pleased to announce full support for the PC version of the first game of the Might and Magic series: Might and Magic Book One: The Secret of the Inner Sanctum. Two modes are supported:
The original look and feel of the game (sound, which in the original consisted of merely the occasional beep, is not supported)
A ScummVM-exclusive enhanced mode, which uses the interface of the later Xeen games, including niceties such as better character screens, automapping, and sound effects. It also integrates the impressive "Might and Magic 1 Graphics Overhaul Mod", which provides better in-game map and monster graphics. The xeen.cc file is required from Might and Magic: IV or Might and Magic: World of Xeen.
Both modes allow saving your game anywhere outside of combat via the ScummVM Global Main Menu (unlike the original game that only saved a single roster when checking into an inn). So make sure you save regularly, just in case you encounter problems.
Help us test both game modes by grabbing a daily build and adding mm.dat to the same folder as your game files. Read through our testing guidelines, and please take some screenshots along the way.
Now, go forth, and discover the true secrets of the game that started the long running epic fantasy series!
