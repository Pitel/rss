        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo condensed their Pokemon Presents stream
Just the other day we got a lengthy Pokemon Presents video that dug deep into Pokemon Scarlet and Violet news: now we have a distillation of that mainline focus while cutting out all the other stuff.  Titled "world overview," the video was put up separately the day after the presentation, and serves as a six minute rundown of the Scarlet and Violet bits.
As a recap, here is what the Pokemon Scarlet and Violet news video entails:
The overview of the "partner legendary" system, which allows you to use the new box legendaries as vehicles (land, sea, and air)
A breakdown of the story, and how you're playing the role of a student at either the Naranja (Scarlet) or Uva (Violet) academy
There are "eight gyms, three stories, and no set path" for conquering the gyms and story progression
An intro to some of the cast (Professors Sada and Turo, Director Clavell, Mr. Jacq, your friend Nemona, Arven the upperclassman, Penny the "shy student," and Grusha the ice type gym leader)
A reminder of some existing old Pokemon, as well as the regional Wooper Paldean form, Fidough, and Cetitan
Footage of the multiplayer function, involving co-op with up to three people and raid battles
The Terastal gimmick, where Pokemon crystalize and can change types
After this presentation, I'm pretty into Scarlet and Violet, mostly due to the promise of the partner exploration system and multiplayer, in tandem. It sounds like a good time to just connect with someone and roam around the Paldea region.

Well, not in real life, but there's a key mechanic in the action RPG, and it's not really for Abyss diving. It's for recording details of the people you meet, the creatures you encounter, and the relics you uncover.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s a grower.
Strange Horticulture takes on some big challenges. It’s a carefully authored story that wants to be driven by interaction, and it’s a single-scene play space that wants to create immersion in a whole world. It’s such a tricky line to walk between structured gameplay that’s interactive but dry and a carefully managed story that limits interaction. But with Strange Horticulture, Bad Viking pulls it off. It creates deep immersion in a well-rounded world while starting from a simple place. The filling-out of the world as we played came from our own discoveries, and we were drawn powerfully into the emerging intrigue of the plot.
In Strange Horticulture, Bad Viking has created a mystery story set in a bizarro-style English Lake District, where real-life place names nestle amid castles, stone circles and religious cults. The player runs an apothecary dealing in specialist plants with medicinal, mind-altering, magical and even mechanical effects. Each day, a series of customers arrive at your counter in need of horticultural help. By cross-referencing what’s on your plant shelf with what’s in your plant-cyclopaedia, you identify the salves, syrups and embrocations that are needed. There’s a loop of learning and labelling plants to receive more plants and more info pages that immediately sucks you in.

Pokémon fans have, rather expectedly, been quite divided on the upcoming mainline titles Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. While many are embracing the new open-world nature of the games and the apparent freedom it affords players, others are disappointed that the games seem to be a step back after Pokémon Legends: Arceus.
Some fans, however, have noticed a very specific change to one of the creatures showcased in the trailer: Eelektross, the final form of Tynamo introduced in Pokémon Black and White.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tencent reportedly opening wallet for majority shares
Tencent is reportedly interested in becoming a majority stakeholder for developer/publisher Ubisoft. According to a new report from news outlet Reuters, the holding company, already a minority stakeholder, is considering making a significant investment in the Assassin's Creed/Far Cry developer in the near future.
Citing multiple sources "with direct knowledge of the matter", Reuters claims that Tencent has expressed a desire to become the key shareholder for Ubisoft, and is allegedly willing to pay an astounding premium of over $100 USD per share in order to make it happen — more than twice the share's current value. Reuters report, unsurprisingly, caused a rise in Ubisoft stock Wednesday, with a 15% rise in value increasing Ubisoft share prices from $43.03 to around $48.33 .
There have been many whispers of a possible Ubisoft sale for some time now, with rumors that the Guillemot family — some of whom are the company's initial founders — might have been looking to purchase the company outright themselves. Should Tencent choose to put its money where its mouth is, however, it seems very unlikely that anyone would be able or willing to match its proposal of an approximate 130% share price. And perhaps the holding company is willing to offer such a premium for that very reason.
Tencent, of course, already has minority and majority stakes in numerous major players within the gaming industry. As well as owning several internal development studios, Tencent holds varying stakes in companies such as Activision, Supercell, Epic Games, Remedy, Riot Games, PlatinumGames, Bohemia Interactive, Dontnod Entertainment, Klei Entertainment, Inflexion, and Funcom.

Square Enix has been a mainstay in the industry for years, but it looks like the Japanese publisher and developer is struggling, having reported declining financial results for Q1 2023 (besides the huge success of its MMORPG, Final Fantasy XIV). And, following the publication of those results, Eurogamer reports that the company is looking to "improve capital efficiency" by selling stakes in its studios.
This comes from an internal conference call held after the results were shared, with MST Financial analyst David Gibson breaking down the discussion on Twitter.

Summer camp culture isn't as much of a thing in the UK, possibly because we're fairly happy to allow our children to learn to tie knots by themselves, by affixing each other to disused railway tracks or sick trees. In any case, the summer camps I've seen portrayed are usually unwholesome ones, because they're good horror fodder. Camp Canyonwood is a camp counsellor sim, out now in early access, where you (an bird) look after a flock of demanding smaller birds. It sounds like it would be twee, except the owner is cutting corners and you dream about a talking jackalope. I have not explored these aspects much because I am constantly trying to feed the children.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Announced at BitSummit
Inti Creates is at it again, continuing to corner the 2D market with the new action platformer Grim Guardians: Demon Purge. The game is actually being shown this weekend at BitSummit in Kyoto, Japan, on August 6 and 7.
Grim Guardians will feature two playable characters (who are sisters) in the form of demon hunters trying to rescue their school from peril: Shinobu Kamizono (ranged attacker) and Maya Kamizono (melee). Inti Creates says "swapping characters is key to gameplay," and in addition to solo play, there's also a two-player co-op mode. As our own CJ Andriessen points out, those two names are from Gal Gun: Double Peace.
Amazingly, Inti Creates is calling this "the beginning of a brand new series of 2D action games," hence the obvious subtitle. Whereas Azure Striker Gunvolt is their own take on the Mega Man franchise, so too will Grim Guardians mirror aspects of Castlevania (like their Bloodstained tie-in projects). Hey, if Konami isn't going to do it, someone else should!
Grim Guardians: Demon Purge release date and platform info
As for a release date and platforms, the former is listed as "TBD," but the latter includes PC, PS4, PS5, Switch, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X. The official website will likely be the first place we'll get that info.
Just as I said in my recent Azure Striker Gunvolt 3 review, I'm game for basically anything Inti Creates that even looks remotely like Grim Guardians. This is an easy sell.

Developer and publisher Inti Creates, known for its work on games such as Mega Man Zero, Azure Striker Gunvolt, and the Castlevania-inspired Bloodstained: Curse of the Moon, has announced that it is working on a brand new 2D action platformer that looks like a beautiful mash up of all three.
Grim Guardians: Demon Purge takes the fast paced shooting mechanics of Mega Man and blends it with the close-quarters melee combat seen in classic Castlevania titles. It stars two demon hunters - Shinobu and Maya - who must infiltrate a dangerous castle that now stands in place of their former school. You'll be able to switch between the two characters on the fly to utilise their unique skills, or you can team up with a friend for two-player co-op gameplay.

I hate reality TV, but I love Gordon Ramsey. Perhaps it’s better to say I like the character that Gordon Ramsey plays, as I understand that he’s not actually that caustic in person. He talks to people like I talk to Ninja Gaiden on the NES; nothing but derision.
Recipe for Disaster is definitely feeding off Kitchen Nightmares. During its early access period, it seemed to highlight that you were hiring a bunch of unique personalities and throwing them into a stew. You’re thrust into a series of struggling restaurants with the intent of rescuing them from their terrible owners. The question is: does Recipe for Disaster deliver on this tantalizing concept? The biggest question is: can Recipe for Disaster convince me not to just reinstall Pizza Connection 2?

A recent update to Microsoft's Game Development Kit is adding a little extra bump in memory for the Xbox Series S. Memory allocation in a GDK update will potentially allow graphical improvements for Xbox Series S games.
In the June GDK, an unlisted video as spotted by The Verge popped up today, detailing improvements to the developer toolkit. One part  notes that more memory is now available for games.
"Hundreds of megabytes" have been freed up, according to the video. This should give developers more control over memory, and could improve graphical performance in memory-constrained situations.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bb6ZLGwkClM
As Ars Technica details, this hasn't been publicly detailed yet. But this could see developers get a little extra memory to work with on the Xbox Series S side of Microsoft's current-gen hardware.
More memory for the box
This seems like good news for Xbox Series S fans who want a little graphical "oomph" on their games. The Xbox Series S is the cheaper of Microsoft's two current-gen offerings, and has proven to be popular.
The relatively cheaper and smaller machine has been a nice surprise for players. It's especially nice for those who aren't necessarily chasing 4K resolution graphics. But as Digital Foundry notes in its Xbox Series S write-up, differences can appear game-to-game.

Hopefully, freeing up this extra memory will help out the Series S versions and deal with some troubles around optimizing for the system. While hundreds of megabytes isn't a sudden multi-GB swing in horsepower, it could be a little uptick that could do a lot.
The GDK update also notes other changes as well, like addressing an issue with graphics virtual addresses. We'll see how this GDK update ultimately pans out for Xbox Series S users in the games to come.

Microsoft has begun testing a new family plan option for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers, and I'm hopeful that it rolls out to the rest of the world sooner than later. Xbox Insiders in Colombia and Ireland can add up to four people to their subscription.
"This makes it even easier to play the best Game Pass games with friends and family across console, PC, and cloud by enabling you to add up to four people to your subscription, all with their own unique access to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate games, content, and benefits," said Sr. Technical Program Manager Tyler Mittleider.
There are a few caveats to keep in mind for the test run, as detailed on the Xbox Wire blog.

Brace Yourself Games is adding even more content to Crypt of the Necrodancer, in the form of a DLC update called Synchrony. The new update was revealed today and is available now in Early Access.
Crypt of the Necrodancer: Synchrony is a brand new content pack, adding a wealth of new features to 2015's rhythm roguelite classic Crypt of the Necrodancer. It's currently only available on PC, though Brace Yourself says it would like to port to other consoles once Synchrony is out of Early Access.

So what's in the update? Well, a big portion is online multiplayer support. Synchrony adds support for up to eight players, in online co-op and versus modes. That's a whole lot of hoppin' and bouncin' to the beat.

One of the most fun (and frustrating) ways to play an old favorite is trying to complete a self-imposed challenge that really ratchets up the difficulty. For me, it was beating a run in Hades on 32 heat — for others, it might be completing a Dark Souls run without taking damage or doing a Nuzlocke of a favorite Pokémon game. When you love a game enough to put the hours in that you need to complete a challenge like this, you'd be surprised at how much you can accomplish — and by how triumphant it feels when you finally beat it. I imagine that streamer Jervalin is riding even higher after winning a $20,000 cash prize for beating a near-impossible challenge in Halo 2.

Who doesn't love a good video game sidekick? I've been playing through some of the old Ratchet & Clank games with a friend, and while A Crack in Time is one of the best of the series, my biggest gripe is that we don't get enough Ratchet and Clank quality time. Maybe I'm just too sentimental, but I really love seeing best buddy characters in my games, and Clank makes just about the best sidekick a girl could ask for.
He's got it all — an adorable personality, quippy dialogue, useful game mechanics, he never gets in the way, and his gameplay sections break things up and provide some cool puzzle mechanics. Clank is so awesome, he got me thinking about some other great — and not so great — sidekicks in video games.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's to establish a new identity, and also a bit easier to say
Koch Media, a games publisher under the grand umbrella of the Embracer Group, is changing up its name. The publisher formerly known as Koch is now Plaion, as the 28-year-old company is rebranding.
Under the moniker of Koch Media, the company operated publishing labels like Deep Silver and Prime Matter. It's part of various games and brands, ranging from Homefront and Metro to Saints Row and Dead Island. The company was purchased by Embracer Group (THQ Nordic at the time) in 2018. Now, it will operate under a new name.
In a press release, Plaion says this new name will better represent the company's history and the groups it works with.
"Our new name offers us the opportunity to build on our rich history as a publishing partner and our outstanding, constantly growing network of world-class development studios and creative people, to keep delivering premium service to our partners, to highlight our ambition as a global player within the entertainment industry but also to reinvent ourselves," said Plaion managing director Klemens Kundratitz. "Our vision is to enable and inspire our worldwide teams and partners, unlocking their full potential."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgjzDJA1o1E
What's in a name?
Speaking to GamesIndustry.biz about the name change, Kundratitz also expresses hope that the name change will make more of an international impact.
"Our name for so many years was associated with physical distribution, perhaps with us being more of a central European company–although including the UK because that was among the first three countries where we launched," Kundratitz told GIbiz. "But we're perhaps not seen as a global company. And it's sometimes difficult for some people to pronounce."
For the record, Plaion is easy to pronounce. It's just play-on. The company's new logo is also stylized around the common triangle used for Play.

Are there developers who I'm willing to forgive for their decisions because my emotions towards them? We all have various biases, it's true.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The cars were weirdly static before this update
Nintendo is revisiting an absurd amount of classic tracks in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe with the Booster Course Pass, and while most of the attention is fixated on the just-released second wave of DLC, there's one small but appreciated change that's worth noting. Now, in the final stretch of Coconut Mall, the Shy Guys don't just sit there in their cars.
The developers shared a short clip of the new Shy Guy antics.
https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1555191948956368897
Granted, in the original Mario Kart Wii version of Coconut Mall, the obstacles were deadlier — the cars drove back and forth and were harder to avoid. That isn't the case here.
This Coconut Mall fix is more of a middle ground for Mario Kart 8 Deluxe players.
The Shy Guys are less static than before (excluding the Time Trial mode, as pictured above), but they aren't too annoying, either. Before, they felt lifeless in a kind of jarring way, and people definitely noticed that something felt off near the finish line. So it's good to see Nintendo go back and improve things, even if it's a small detail in the grand scheme.
After you're done playing the Turnip and Propellor Cups in Wave 2 of the Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Booster Course Pass, maybe circle back for a match on Coconut Mall. I'm excited to hop online tonight, especially for the all-new track, Sky-High Sundae.
At this point, kind of against all odds, I feel like I've gotten good mileage out of the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pass.

The crypt has been silent for five years, reads the trailer for the new Crypt of the Necrodancer DLC. Frankly, we like our crypts silent, but we're not Brace Yourself Games, a studio that presumably needs people to know about their games.
Crypt of the Necrodancer, the beloved rhythm-dungeon-crawler that would eventually spin off into a Nintendo-sanctioned Zelda collab, Cadence of Hyrule, is coming back from the dead with all-new DLC. The new content pack, which is called SYNCHRONY, will include new characters, items, enemies, traps, weapons, spells, shrines, and more.

Yesterday's Pokémon Presents brought us a ton of new info on generation 9, Pokémon Scarlet & Violet. After some silence from Game Freak and The Pokémon Company on the upcoming open-world RPGs, we got a full 10 minutes of news, visuals, and info, and there are a lot of new features coming.
Of course, Scarlet & Violet weren't the only games that got some time in the limelight, but it's what we're probably most happy with. Because the rest of the presentation followed a pretty standard formula. Some of us loved what we saw, particularly from generation 9, but it also has some of us asking — have Pokémon Presents become a bit too predictable?

Ukrainian developer Frogwares, known for their elaborate and interesting video game takes on the Sherlock Holmes stories, have experienced a great deal of difficulty in recent months, for unfortunately obvious reasons. After their country rapidly became a warzone, they were faced with having to flee, choosing whether to join the resistance, or staying in their homes amidst great danger.
"We never know when and where the next shelling will take place," said a dev team update. "We all have to adapt to this new reality and continue our work as best as we can."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hardly out-of-pocket, in all sense of the term
Mobile gaming, which has continued to grow from strength to strength on a yearly basis, saw its first decline in revenue for some time in the first half of 2022. The slump in overall sales and in-game transactions hit most genres, though many of the most popular titles continue to hold steady.
The new data, published by the industry analysts over at Sensor Tower, shows that only the "Arcade" genre saw any significant growth, with a raise of around 14% year-on-year, which equates to somewhere in the region of $176 million USD. Almost all other genres — from racing games to puzzlers, RPGs to shooters, and even the cash cow of casino games — all saw a hefty decline in sales figures.

Overall, the U.S. mobile gaming market was down by almost 10% over the previous year. This won't find the industry on the ropes just yet, however, as it still raked in somewhere in the region of $11.4 billion. Astounding. The decline in mobile gaming revenue has been equated to both the increased cost of living, economical issues, and the softening of COVID-19 restrictions, which has seen more people out and about, rather than sitting at home idly on their phones.
Mobile gaming is just one of a number of industry sectors that have reported a revenue decline in 2022. Publishers such as PlayStation, Activision Blizzard, and Nintendo have all seen either hardware, software, or operating income fall when compared to the same period the previous year. While none of these slumps are big enough to cause any sweats, it is clear that the gaming industry as a whole is entering something of a down period, one very likely to continue as 2022 progresses.

The top two spots are taken up by two brand-new releases this week. Monolith Soft's Xenoblade Chronicles 3 runs away with the number one spot, selling a staggering 112,728 physical copies. No surprises here, really, as the game is reviewing incredibly well and was one of the most-anticipated launches on the Switch for this year.

A new Monster Hunter Rise stream is coming in hot, as Capcom has announced an August 9 date: all of it will deal with Title Update 1.
So it's actually going to be at 7AM PT on August 9, right here on the Monster Hunter Twitch channel. Producer Ryozo Tsujimoto and game director Yoshitake Suzuki will be stopping by for the express purpose of diving into Title Update 1: a free update for Sunbreak coming this month that will add Lucent Nargacuga, Seething Bazelgeuse, and several other features. Hopefully beyond the big stuff, they'll talk about little quality of life features — like this Marionette Spider change.
In recent Monster Hunter news, Capcom reminds folks that there's a franchise sale going on right now on Steam, which includes a near-50% discount on Rise. It's not a bad time to get into Monster Hunter at the moment, given the proliferation of Rise on a popular console and PC, and the steady release of lots of free updates. By the time you work your way through all of the history of Rise, original free updates included, it should last you a long while before you're allowed to rank up to coast to the expansion.
Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak Title Update 1 recap (August):
Seething Bazelgeuse
Lucent Nargacuga (and “several other monsters”)
New locale: Forlorn area
Rare species monsters
Special species monsters

After the launch of Wave 1 of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe's Booster Course Pass, everyone and their nan turned their attention towards Wave 2; specifically, when on earth it would be coming out. Excitment reached fever pitch (just check out the comments section of any Mario Kart Tour related content if you don't believe us!), so naturally, expectations for the latest batch of courses are exceedingly high. Was it all worth it, though? Let's find out.
With the addition of Wave 2, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe has now gained a total of sixteen new tracks so far in 2022. Just let that sink in for a moment: sixteen new tracks. It's a five-year-old game, for goodness sake. Eight, if you count the original Wii U release! We've tried to keep this figure in mind when playing through these new courses and really look at the bigger picture here, because the new tracks on offer in the Turnip Cup and the Propeller Cup are a mixed bag, to say the least.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Will The Blue Blur make an appearance?
SNK has announced that it is working on a second compendium of titles pulled from the back catalog of the Neo Geo Pocket Color. While the studio has made an official reveal for Neo Geo Pocket Color Selection Vol. 2, it remained shy about delivering any information whatsoever pertaining to the release.
The original Neo Geo Pocket Color Selection launched on PC and Nintendo Switch in March of 2021 and is packed out with 10 hit games for SNK's awesome, but ultimately unsuccessful, handheld console. The original release featured hits such as Samurai Shodown! 2, SNK Gals Fighters, Dark Arms: Beast Buster 1999, Big Tournament Golf, and The King of Fighters R-2, but did not contain independent re-releases such as SNK vs. Capcom: Card Fighters Clash, or the brilliant Match of the Millennium. (Note: MotM was only excluded from the Steam edition.)
While SNK has not announced platforms, a release date, nor a game listing for the second selection, one would assume it would compile the aforementioned omissions and — if we're extremely lucky — the NGPC ports of Bandai Namco's Pac-Man and Sega's Sonic the Hedgehog. According to SNK, more details are set to follow soon. In related news, the NGPC version of rarity Mega Man Battle & Fighters dropped out of nowhere on Nintendo Switch.
Neo Geo Pocket Color Selection Vol. 2 is currently in development at SNK.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[More terrors lurk in the world of Back 4 Blood
Back 4 Blood is getting its next expansion at the end of this month. Children of the Worm, the second DLC expansion for Back 4 Blood, goes live on August 30, 2022.
The Children of the Worm will have a new story campaign, adding an Act 5 to the action. New enemies threaten to cause a bunch of problems for the Cleaner crew.
But the survivors will have some back-up, too. A new playable Cleaner, "Prophet" Dan, is also joining the action. A previous preacher of the end times, he'll probably make for a wacky addition to the roster of playable characters.

The expansion will also include some new weapons, cards, and skins. Anyone who picked up the Back 4 Blood Annual Pass, or the Deluxe or Ultimate Edition, gets Children of the Worm as part of that. Otherwise, Children of the Worm will be available as a standalone purchase.
The ongoing apocalypse
This new entry marks Back 4 Blood's second expansion, following after the Tunnels of Terror DLC expansion that went live in April. The Tunnels added some new Cleaners and special variations of the Ridden to deal with, alongside the Ridden Hives.
With an Act 5 on the way and even more stuff to do, it's nice to see that Back 4 Blood seems to be getting a steady cadence of post-launch support. It was a pretty good time for co-op at launch, and I really grew to like the card system that Turtle Rock created for this new variation on the co-op PvE survival game. Even if it hit some stumbles out of the gate, Back 4 Blood has kept on rolling on.
And if you like Turtle Rock's particular brand of PvE, well, it's a good time. Not only is Back 4 Blood getting some more content, but apparently the servers for Evolve have popped on and players have been dipping a toe back in.
As for the Children of the Worm, the new DLC expansion arrives on August 30 for PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.

If all had gone according to the original plan, they’d already be out and playable, but repeated delays have hit, leaving only one card – the low-end Arc A380 – having a muted launch in China only. As of early August, the full range of GPUs haven’t even been announced in an official capacity. These were meant to finally provide the competition to Nvidia and AMD’s best graphics cards, so where’s the deets?

We've already covered the big change that Nintendo has made to the fan-favourite course Coconut Mall, but besides that, there are a handful of other fixes alongside some of the more obvious ones in version 2.1.0 (thanks, Nintendo Everything!).

While the 3DS is shutting down its eShop early next year, another marketplace is dying a slow death. The Wii U YouTube app now has an end-of-life date, and so do two other services on the console.
As pointed out by Nintendo Everything, the YouTube support page for the Wii U was recently updated, stating: "Note: The YouTube app is no longer available for new downloads from the Wii U eShop due to Nintendo’s upcoming discontinuation. Starting in October, the YouTube app will no longer be available on Wii U devices. Viewers can still enjoy YouTube on Nintendo Switch devices." Although the 3DS and Wii U shutdown is March 27, 2023, a few companies are getting things started a little earlier (to prepare for the other phase of the shutdown, where on August 29, 2022, you can't use Nintendo eShop card funds on both marketplaces).
Crunchyroll is doing the same thing, as this Twitter user has revealed: they sent out an email to Wii U users that service was ending on August 29, 2022. Finally, Niconico has a page up similar to Google, which talks about the end of service, mostly for the 3DS app, which has been in operation since 2014.
It all makes sense, it's just rare to be able to talk about the two systems these days: so I'm going to take every opportunity. Also, the below "we're sad to see you go" image from Niconico is great. To see anyone even recognize the 3DS and Wii U in 2022 warms my heart.

I have been a fan of kaiju and Japanese giant monster films since a childhood friend lent me his VHS of Godzilla 1985 for a weekend. Eight years old at the time, I didn’t realize the movie was actually a pretty crappy Americanization of a far superior Japanese film. I just liked watching this big green lizard tear shit up. I watched the tape three times over that first weekend, forever changed by what I saw. To my eight-year-old mind, this was cinema.
By the time school rolled around on Monday, I was already making plans to scour my local video rental shops for whatever Shōwa and Heisei era Toho films they were hiding on their shelves.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ice Code Games may have called it Hard West 2, but 'round these parts we refer to it as "The Laughing Deer Show". New to town, are ya? Let me clue you in. Laughing Deer is a six-foot man of raw muscle and rage, a native American warrior with shoulders like a pair of yoked oxen and a personality best described as "barely contained". Unlike the rest of his posse, which includes a cowboy without a shadow, a woman with ties to the occult, and one very stubborn corpse, Laughing Deer doesn't really "do" guns. While his compatriots are all crouched behind crates, ricocheting bullets off buckets and wheelbarrows to hit enemies from behind, Laughing Deer is getting in their faces (shortly before his club gets significantly further into their faces).
Now, bringing a club to a gunfight might not seem like the smartest idea. But while pistols require two of a gunslinger's action points to shoot, and rifles take all three, it only takes one action point to whack some neckerchief-wearing bandit with a big ol' stick. And Laughing Deer whacks a whole point of damage harder than normal, meaning he can rush foes and nail them into the ground with a couple of hard swings before they can pull the trigger. Better yet, killing an enemy completely refills a character's action points in Hard West, meaning that, when set up right, Laughing Deer can ping around the battlefield like a weaponised pinball.

Vantage hails from the icy world of Pagos, and her skills as a sharpshooter are borne out in her three powerful abilities - not least of which is her custom sniper rifle Ultimate, which she can bring out before the ability has even fully charged in order to snipe enemies and mark them for increased damage for her entire team.
Take a closer look at her dangerous-sounding abilities in the new Apex Legends vignette trailer below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm back from my holidays to record The Electronic Wireless Show podcast once again, and I've brought a reader email and a new tattoo of Murray from Monkey Island with me. These are both relevant, because the email from James suggests that we talk about the games that we'd like to play for the first time again - just erase them from our heads and encounter them anew. Thus, we discuss Lucasarts games like the Monkey Island series. See, I tied it all together.
In fact, I'm not sure if I'd wipe Monkey Island from my head or not, because I can't be sure how much of my love for it is fuelled by nostalgia. Matthew has other concerns, though, because as is our usual fashion we spend some time discussing the question "what games would you play for the first time again?" more literally than is intended. What grave consequences would come from erasing certain things from your brain? What sort of person would co-host Nate be if he wiped the Civ games from his memory? Listen in to find out.

      <p>Mega Man fans in the west got a surprise treat with the global launch of Mega Man Battle &amp; Fighters on Switch. The game was originally released for the Neo Geo Pocket Color and has never been released outside of Japan until now.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The game was first released in 2000 and serves as a portable bundle of two arcade games: Mega Man: The Power Battle and Mega Man 2: The Power Fighters (both of which were recently included in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/04/11/capcom-is-releasing-an-arcade-stadium-sequel-with-32-more-games" target="_blank">Capcom Arcade 2nd Stadium</a>&nbsp;collection). Players can play as Mega Man, Proto Man, Bass, and Duo to engage in a series of boss battles against robot masters from Mega Man 1 through 7. A total of 40 bosses await, and players gain character data by defeating them with the added goal of filling a personal database.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Despite launching stateside, this is a largely direct&nbsp;port of the&nbsp;Japanese version, and the game’s original link cable trading function has been disabled. You can pick&nbsp;it up now for $7.99.</p>]]></summary>

The Two Point County Cinematic Universe (TPCCU) excites me. Two Point Studios launched Two Point Hospital with the intent of building a landscape where all their future games would happen. Two Point Campus is the next step. It’s not a sequel, but the aesthetics, the characters, and even the UI call back to their first title. It reminds me of Maxis in the ‘90s before and directly after EA got their evil all over them. A lot of the games sprung up around SimCity, and while not all of them were as directly related as the ones from Two Point Studios, some were tied together, even if it was just in a reference.
I’ve been eagerly waiting for the next step in the Two Point experience. Actually, I’ve been waiting for the next few steps.…]]></summary>

But its foundations remain the same: you're a manager with a budget and you've got to turn the fortunes of increasingly prestigious – and in some cases, bonkers – institutions around. Of course, this time you're not dealing with injured mummies and lazy surgeons, you're in charge of running university campuses (campi?) and ensuring they deliver a solid education.
The job of a university president is a pretty relaxed affair, which means you're able to soak in the joys of watching your oddball students grow. But this leniency means it struggles to reward you for constructing a campus that's uniquely yours.

      <p>Like <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2021/10/04/chip-shortage-affecting-console-supplies-will-last-into-2022" target="_blank">Xbox and PlayStation</a>, Nintendo also suffers from supply issues and component shortages. This might explain why a recent Nikkei report – relayed by Bloomberg's game and tech writer, Takashi Mochizuki (see below) – stated that there wouldn't be new hardware releases this fiscal year.&nbsp;</p>


<blockquote class="tw-align-center twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Nikkei: there will be no new Nintendo hardware this fiscal year, which ends in March 2023. Not immediately clear whether that part of the article is from Nikkei's own reporting or what Nintendo President, who Nikkei interviewed for the story, said. <a href="https://t.co/HJVqk9Kbef">https://t.co/HJVqk9Kbef</a></p>

<p>Mochizuki's tweet reads, "There will be no new Nintendo hardware this fiscal year, which ends in March 2023. Not immediately clear whether that part of the article is from Nikkei's own reporting or what Nintendo President, who Nikkei interviewed for the story, said."</p>

<p>For all the Nintendo fans speculating a Switch “Pro” release – sorry, it looks like that’s not happening any time soon. In any case, the Switch recently crossed <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/08/03/nintendo-switch-crosses-111-million-units-sold-but-overall-sales-are-down" target="_blank">111 million units sold</a>, but overall sales are down by 22.9%. Perhaps Nintendo will pivot to hardware announcements after the fiscal year comes to a close.&nbsp;</p>]]></summary>

Player First Games has announced that season one of its crazy crossover fighter MultiVersus has been delayed and will no longer meet its initially scheduled August 9 launch date. The developer announced that delay earlier today on social media, with a rescheduled date to be announced.
"A big thank you to everyone playing MultiVersus. It’s exciting to see so many players enjoying the game and the launch of the Open Beta is just the beginning," said the team on Twitter. "We want to let everyone know that we are delaying the start of Season 1 & the release of Morty to a later date. We know this might be disappointing for some and want to assure our Community that we are dedicated to delivering new and exciting content that delights players."
"We’ll let you know the timing as soon as we can. We appreciate your patience & enthusiasm and look forward to unveiling Season 1 very soon!"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvborgKG7fw
MultiVersus, which entered open beta just last week, has already had a very impressive opening, with the PC version logging an amazing peak of 144,000 players during its opening weekend. The free-to-play fighter quickly became the fourth most popular title on Steam, with the impressive figures not even taking into account additional player numbers for the PlayStation and Xbox editions of the beta.
As MultiVersus is still in its playtest stages, Player First Games is using this time to gather various feedback about the title, from its online connectivity and crossplay function, to in-game balance and various bugs that may need ironing out (and I ain't just talking Bunny). If you want to check out the action for yourself, then all you need do is download the game client on the platform of your choice, and you're ready to rock.
MultiVersus is in open beta now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

      <p>Funcom and The Outsiders have announced a metal concert happening at this year's Gamescom in Cologne, Germany to celebrate the impending release of their heavy metal rhythmic shooting game, Metal: Hellsinger. The concert, which takes place on August 25, hopes to become the largest concert ever put on at the massive annual gaming convention.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Several of the vocalists featured in Metal: Hellsinger will be on hand to perform their songs from the soundtrack. Matt Heafy of Trivium, Alissa White-Gluz of Arch Enemy, Mikael Stanne of Dark Tranquility, Dennis Lyxzén of Refused and INVSN, and James Dorton of Black Crown Initiate are all currently scheduled to take the stage. The concert is set to kick off at 7 p.m. Central European Summer Time (1 p.m. Eastern/10 a.m. Pacific). The event is free and open to thousands of in-person attendees, with potentially millions being able to join through a livestream, which will be detailed at a later date.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My cycling tour of video games is almost at its end but we're in no hurry. Let's pause for a wee break, like in Lonely Mountains: Downhill. The mountain biking game is full of gnarly descents, dangerous jumps, and barely controlled skids, but also has secret spots where you can sit down and enjoy a nice view for as long as you like. Lonely Mountains is a collection of little adventures, each leading to your tent at the end of the day. Delightful.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo has dated them for September 9
It's not often you get amiibo news anymore, but Nintendo did just that, and gave us a date for the Steve and Alex Minecraft amiibo figures: September 9. Note that this is the same day Splatoon 3 is out!
As a reminder, the duo is actually coming out as a result of their appearance in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate as fighters, and will function as normal as characters that can be trained as CPUs with the figures themselves. While the jury is still out on US orders, they've been available to pre-order for nearly a year now on some Japanese marketplaces as a two-pack, including Amazon Japan (where I secured a pre-order in October). The date for some of those markets still lists "December 31, 2022" as a placeholder release, which we expect to shift soon given this news. While amiibo do not strictly follow a "global release date" system, it's typically close enough barring regional delays.
Production on amiibo has slowed down in recent years, and 2022 has only hosted the Min Min figure thus far. Soon it'll have Steve and Alex, as well as three Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak figures. As for what's left, we don't know for sure what the future holds on random and third-party tie-ins, but we do have the rest of the Smash Ultimate DLC cast to go: Sephiroth, Pyra/Mythra, Kazuya, and Sora.
As always, we have a full up-to-date list of amiibo that's been updated since 2015.
[Update: At the time of this update, Best Buy has the 2-pack in stock. This 2-pack format seems to be the way they're being distributed all over the world, and is consistent with 2021 pre-orders.]

Square Enix has finally decided the time is right to officially lift the lid on one of the industry's worst-kept secrets — the iconic developer has announced that Tactics Ogre: Reborn will launch on PlayStation, PC, and Nintendo Switch platforms on November 11.
Tactics Ogre: Reborn is a fresh remake of 2010 PSP release Tactics Ogre: Let Us Cling Together. Further confuddling matters, the 2010 release was, in itself, a remake of the 1995 Super Famicom edition of Let Us Cling Together — a title which would receive both PlayStation and Sega Saturn ports in the mid-'90s, but never venture outside of Japanese shores in any official capacity.

Konami and Apple Arcade teamed up for another game, and this one's got a quirky musical twist. Amazing Bomberman flips the script on the series' familiar explosion-dodging action with score chasing and battlegrounds that change to suit the song.
As short as this trailer is, it's worth a look.
https://youtu.be/cBxlRu3Fd5I
According to Konami, "the bomb placement and explosion sounds change with the songs, and the battle time also changes depending on the song. When the song gets exciting, blocks will drop, and items may appear when you break them with bombs."
If you take a fireball to the face, you'll careen off the screen — but you can revive "as many times as you want as long as the song is playing."
With that in mind, the goal is less about staying aliv…]]></summary>

A new stability patch is live for TMNT: Shredder's Revenge, across all platforms. The update is set to address bugs and make game stability improvements for all the turtle-powered action.

Thanks to a tip from a reader, it's come to our attention that the game is now available on the eShop for $7.99, with no fanfare and no official announcement from the publisher or Nintendo's weekly eShop drop. This edition is actually an "arrangement" of two games (Power Battle and the sequel, Power Fighters), in the form of a Neo Geo Pocket port.

Three classic Resident Evil characters, including one of the series' most iconic villains, are joining in on the asymmetrical horror. Rebecca Chambers, Ada Wong, and Albert Wesker are all coming to Dead by Daylight soon.
Revealed today as part of Behaviour Interactive's look-ahead showcase, the three characters arrive as part of an update called Resident Evil: Project W. It's probably safe to say the "W" stands for Wesker.
While Albert Wesker, the Mastermind, will take on the role of Killer, two heroines are joining the roster to help the others out. Rebecca Chambers and Ada Wong will be Survivors, part of the crew trying to evade the killer and make it out alive.

      <p>Since its first season launch in 2016, I’ve always felt like the Westworld TV series offered an especially compelling commentary on the video game hobby. Like a lot of sci-fi, the show leverages futuristic technology and far-fetched ideas to get its point across. But at its core, it’s still a show about the psychology of people playing a game and how that game is really just about life and the decisions we make that shape that life. Westworld may not borrow from a longstanding video game license. Still, with its incisive and often surprising perspectives, it …]]></summary>

It's the turn of long-time developer/publisher Electronic Arts to share its results from the most recent quarter of the 2023 financial year. And while many publishers are showing a slump in overall revenue, EA seems to be relatively healthy, powered by its ongoing dominance over the sporting game industry.
Overall revenue for EA is up 14% year-on-year, which translates to a meaty $1.77 billion USD. Net income is also up — offering a huge 52% rise which equates to $311 million. It will probably come as zero surprise that the FIFA franchise is still one of the aces in EA's portfolio, with FIFA Mobile and microtransactions service FIFA Ultimate Team continuing to grow in both revenue and users. FUT has, notably, seen its user base rise by 40% in the past 12 months.
It also seems that EA's purchase of Codemasters was a very savvy decision, as the UK developer's F1 22 has actually outperformed on the publisher's expectations. Codemasters was, of course, purchased by EA for $1.2 billion back in early 2021. EA was hoping that the acquisition would give it a dominant stake in the racing game market, and it seems that the British studio is already delivering on those hopes.
This year's FIFA entry, FIFA 23, will be the final football sim released with the official FIFA branding. While EA has a huge task ahead in rebranding one of the biggest and most profitable gaming franchises on the planet, the community knows where its dedication lies, and it seems hugely unlikely that the loss of the FIFA brand will harm EA's bottom line in the bigger picture.

Activision Blizzard and NetEase have collaborated on several projects, including the recent Diablo Immortal. But a new report claims a potential Warcraft mobile game has fallen through.
Bloomberg reports that a World of Warcraft mobile game has been shuttered. The project was in development for three years, but according to Bloomberg's sources, the two companies disagreed over financial terms and ultimately called it off.
The team of over 100 developers has allegedly been disbanded. Some were reportedly offered internal transfers. A spokesperson for NetEase declined to comment on the matter to Bloomberg. An Activision Blizzard spokesperson gave no comment.

Warcraft in the palm of your hand
The canceled project, code-named as Neptune according to Bloomberg, was a massively multiplayer online RPG set in the World of Warcraft universe. The report says it wouldn't be a direct one-to-one of the mega-hit WoW, but a spinoff set during a different time period.
NetEase and Blizzard have collaborated on several major projects, so the report comes as a bit of a surprise. Alongside Diablo Immortal, which has received some frustrated reactions from fans, NetEase also publishes World of Warcraft and other Blizzard franchises in China.
Though fans haven't been wild about the microtransactions, Diablo Immortal has continued to see growth, and World of Warcraft is building up to the launch of its next expansion Dragonflight.
Whether this is a stumbling block or not, it looks like mobile Warcraft plans are on hold for now. Or at least the reportedly MMO-based ones, that is. There is the upcoming Warcraft Arclight Rumble, a game similar to Clash of Clans that's coming to Android and iOS.

I have a bunch of friends who persisted and now spend their weekends in gyms and car parks, where they skate under 11/10 names like Correctional Felicity and give each other huge bruises. I can't be sure, but from their activity on social media I estimate they spend about 114% of their time being excited about roller derby, which I endorse. Now both they (and people like me, who find wheels frightening), can spend even more free time on roller derby with the annoucenment of 2023's sports management game Roller Drama.

While it wasn’t their first Life Is Strange - the Colorado studio released the spin-off  game Before The Storm in 2017 - it was the first time they were tasked with creating their own world and characters, instead of inheriting Dontnod’s creations.

<p>Even if you've made it rich in Sea of Thieves and are loaded to the gills in gold, you can only purchase one of each type of ship: the Sloop, Brigantine, and Galleon. Within the teaser video above, we see the Sloop goes for 250,000 gold, the Brigantine for 375,000, and the four-person Galleon at 500,000.

I was going to head in a different direction for my second deals post of the night, but when I spotted this deal on a great mid-range AMD graphics card I knew I had to double-dip on CCL's excellent summer sale. 
The British retailer is offering the AMD RX 6700 for £299 when you use code AFF15, bringing a PowerColor Fighter OC model down to the lowest price we've seen for this class of card. The 6700 is a strong contender for 1080p and 1440p gaming, and this factory overclocked model ought to outperform other options in the field.

That means it's a good time to pick up current-gen models at a discount while availability is good - and this RTX 3080 12GB model is the cheapest we've ever seen it. 
Right now, you can pick up this Gainward Phantom RTX 3080 12GB for £724 when you use code AFF25 at the checkout at CCL. If you're not familiar with CCL, the British retailer is a minnow compared to the whale of Amazon, but it's one that has existed since 1996 and has always proved reliable for me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Logitech have launched the Aurora Collection, a set of bright, customisable PC gaming peripherals built to be “gender inclusive”. Fortunately, that seems to be more than just pastel colours and cynical “For girls” marketing – the G375 headset, G705 mouse, and the G715 and G713 keyboards are all proper gaming-spec accessories, and they’ve been crafted by mostly female design and engineering teams based on feedback from women PC players.


The G705, then, is a wireless mouse designed for smaller hands, while the G375 headset – also wireless – is proportioned to fit smaller heads and has more space in the earcups to accommodate earrings. It’s safe to say I’m not the Aurora Collection’s target audience, but having used the G705, the G375, and the G715 wireless keyboard as my main peripherals for a few days, I can say all three are pretty swish playthings regardless of how you identify. What’s more, their light, soft-cornered aesthetic is a nice break from the blacks, greys and harsh angles that have become standard design language for gaming gear. Anyone who’s ever cringed their face inside out at a peripheral resembling Megatron’s running shoe may indeed find these more to their tastes.

      <p>A new Pokémon Presents showcase will be held this week and it will be a video presentation with updates onPokémon apps and games, including Pokémon Scarlet and Violet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>More specifically, this upcoming Pokémon Presents will air at 6 a.m. PT/9 a.m. ET on Aug. 3 – so this Wednesday. As for what to expect, the tweet announcing this presentation says we'll be getting updates on Pokémon apps (Pokémon Sleep perhaps?) and games, including Scarlet and Violet.</p>

<p>If it's like past presentations, we'll likely get a trailer or two for the upcoming ninth generation of Pokémon as well as new details regarding the world of these games.&nbsp;I'm hoping we get a look at the mid-stage evolutions of the starters and more information about the region.

That seems like a good thing on the its face, but many Minecraft players aren't happy that it extends to private servers. 

Naturally, because this is Minecraft, players have changed what they don't like. There are now mods which strip messages of information tieing them to your player profile.

Is Kenny Pickett ranked high enough at a 68? If you don't think so, you can call into Madden NFL's ratings adjustor hotline (at&nbsp;689-278-3030) to recommend it go up or down. Thousands of people called in within the first day of the hotline launching, and from EA's snarky Twitter tone, it would appear most of them are complaints, likely about a beloved players rating being too low or a hated players…]]></summary>

It’s undeniably a bummer to see a title you’re excited about slip into the following year, but it’s generally for the best to ensure a quality product at release. 2022 has had a growing handful of high-profile setbacks, and we’ve assembled them all in one alphabetized list for a handy reference.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the age of years-long development cycles, it seems miraculous that Wolfenstein 3D, a game that spawned the modern-day FPS as we know it, was developed by six people in just six months. The story of Wolfenstein 3D’s development makes for a fascinating time capsule of those early days of game development - a milestone in gaming history that underlines just how much the industry has grown over the decades since.
But that’s getting ahead of ourselves a bit. The origins of Wolfenstein 3D, a gloriously violent game that paved the way for the even more gloriously violent Doom, can be found in a somewhat more cutesy series of titles: the Commander Keen series. id Software made four of these side-scrolling platformers for MS-DOS in very quick succession between 1990 and 1991, and studio co-founder John Romero tells us that the team was definitely ready for a change.

But I did see two upcoming games with similar names: Bicycle Mechanic Simulator and Bike Mechanic Simulator 2023. Alas, I fear they might be PlayWay-style sims where you just click stuff in order then it all works tickety-boo. That is not the bike repair I know and begrudgingly enjoy.

      <p>Our brief first look at NBA 2K23's on-court action shows off the fluidity of play and attention to detail that unfolds even after the whistle is blown. For years, this series has been lauded as a graphical powerhouse, and this teaser sizzles in this way.</p>

<p>We'll have to see how the footage shown breaks down as far as new gameplay features, but it would appear perimeter play is getting some of the spotlight this year. The realism in the superstars is also on display, both on the court and in how they celebrate and interact with fans.</p>

<p>NBA 2K23 will have three different looks on retail stands with NBA Legend Michael Jordan on one cover, Phoenix's Devin Booker on another, and the WNBA's Sue Bird and Diana Taurasi on the third. Michael Jordan's return unfolds through 15 different Jordan Challenge scenarios that recreate key moments from his career.</p>

<p>More details should be coming soon, as 2K Sports aims to ship NBA 2K23 on September 9 for PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC.</p>]]></summary>

Since then, the team have been keeping game details under wraps, but now thanks to the Annapurna Interactive showcase, Outerloop have released a free Steam demo, meaning now we can all have a go at beating the pulp out of our exes - a dream come true. 
You play as Jala, a young woman who just got booted out of her shared apartment after having a fight with her, now, ex-partner. With nowhere else to go, she’s decided to take the bus back to her hometown of Timber Hills to move back in with her parents (hopefully, temporarily). While she's killing time on the journey, she begins to take a dating personality quiz aptly titled ‘What’s your Thirstsona?’ and it transports her to a colourful dreamlike metaverse where she can skate around and answer deep questions about her love life. Is she really a lost cause in love?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Having given the MultiVersus closed beta a whirl around a month ago, I thought it was a free-to-play Smash Bros-like that came out swinging. And now I've returned to the open beta phase of the multiverse where Bugs Bunny and Taz The Tazmanian Devil are joined by... Lebron James?! Honestly, my thoughts remain largely unchanged – which is a good thing! It's a fun free-to-play fighter that iterates on the Smash formula but can't quite emulate its predecessor's polish.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's a set of Unreal assets that Alice of Bees once described as "angry playmobil". I've wanted to quote that for years but had yet to play a game using them that grabbed me enough to warrant an article. Let us be thankful, then, for ADACA, an angry playmobil FPS.
It's actually two games, and I'm not sure which to call the main event. I know which one I prefer, because the story mode is a love letter to Half-Life 2, complete with Bane-muffled jackboot cops, endlessly catching up with a Story Guy who's inexplicably ahead of you again, a bionic arm standing in for the gravity gun, and a spooky dark underground section where you're swarmed by creepy mutants. It was good enough to tempt me this week, despite a few minor niggles, but its other half, Zone Patrol, is a Stalker-esque sandbox where it really shines.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p><iframe frameborder='0' width='560' height='315' src='https://players.brightcove.net/694940074001/rydylbNsz_default/index.html?videoId=6310185615112'/></iframe></p>
      

      <p>"A new chapter is about to begin amidst a tangled web of factions." This line accompanies the latest teaser trailer for <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/genshin-impact/genshin-impact-review-into-the-great-wide-open">Genshin Impact</a>, the incredible free-to-play RPG from miHoYo. The trailer dives into the game's fourth region,&nbsp;Sumeru, which is home to people who can't dream and worship the God of Wisdom.</p>

<p>Suermu looks lush in foliage, with mushroom creatures scurrying about the trunks of sizable trees. It also contains a desert area and looks to be just as sizable as the game's other areas.</p>

<p>The trailer also introduces a host of companion characters that players will meet as quests are completed. The first new character is Tighnari, a forest watcher who we see holding a magical firefly. In Port Ormos, players will run into Alhaitham from the Haravatat in the Akademiya. Further into the game, players meet Dehya of the Desertfolk, who is also a mercenary for the&nbsp;Emerites. There are also Nilou, a character who is pursuing art and dance, Nahida, a mysterious being, and Cyno, the General Mahamatra.</p>

<p>All of this content is a part of Genshin Impact's 03 update, which doesn't have a release date yet, but appears to be close, given how much miHoYo has revealed. Genshin Impact is currently available on PlayStation consoles and PC, and works just as well on Android, and iOS.</p>

<p>Are you still invested in Genshin Impact? If so, what do you hope to see from the new update?</p>]]></summary>

Was it a secret area? An unfinished area? A hoax? Viral marketing? A mod? If it was a mod, it was far more complex than any so far. Turns out, that's because a group of fans have secretly been making their own mod tools, and plan to release them soon. In the meantime, I've enjoyed pranksters memeing on the mystery by creating secret churches in other games, including Half-Life 2 and Super Mario 64.

      <p>Annapurna Interactive concluded its showcase today by debuting The Lost Wild, Great Ape Games dinosaur-laden survival game.</p>

<p>The Lost Wild was first announced last October with a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjpWlBwHwek" target="_blank">pre-alpha trailer</a>&nbsp;and is described as a first-person survival horror game. Players control an investigative reporter guided by a mysterious voice over the radio to explore abandoned Japanese facilities nestled within an island forest teeming with prehistoric wildlife. These dinos are highly intelligent and realistically behave like animals, featuring what Great Ape describes as self-preservation and reactive systemic AI behaviors.&nbsp;</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" frameBorder="0"  allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true" src="https://players.brightcove.net/694940074001/rydylbNsz_default/index.html?videoId=6310134087112"></iframe>

<p>Players can use stealth to avoid detection while exploring, create distractions, or repel dinos using items like flares and makeshift, non-lethal weaponry. You’ll spend much of the game scrounging for materials as you traverse ruins for clues about the island’s history and how you ended up in this dire situation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to the game’s <a href="https://thelostwild.com/faq/" target="_blank">FAQ</a>, The Lost Wild won’t be arriving until late 2024 or early 2025. It has been confirmed for PC via Steam but will also come to unspecified consoles.&nbsp;</p>]]></summary>

      <p>Keita Takahashi, the creator of the Katamari series, has a new game in the works. Unfortunately, it’s tough to know exactly what it is.</p>

<p>A teaser trailer premiered during today’s Annapurna Showcase showed a few seconds of close-up footage of an animated child snoring in his sleep. What does it mean? Your guess is as good as ours, but we fully expect it to be weird given Takahashi’s history.</p>

<p>Takahashi’s last big title was the colorful&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/wattam/a-charming-little-storybook" target="_blank">Wattam</a>, released in 2019 and published by Annapurna. This new title looks to continue the relationship between the two partners.</p>]]></summary>

      <p>Annapurna Interactive revealed an eye-brow-raising&nbsp;new shooter called Bounty Star: The Morose Tale of Graveyard Clem. The title blends mech gameplay and farming&nbsp;with a wild west aesthetic, and it’s coming next year.&nbsp;</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" frameBorder="0"  allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true" src="https://players.brightcove.net/694940074001/rydylbNsz_default/index.html?videoId=6310132198112"></iframe>

<p>Players control Clementine McKinny, a&nbsp;bounty hunter and former soldier looking to atone for her past by keeping the peace in the Red Expanse, a post-apocalyptic version of the American Southwest. She uses her trusty mech suit to keep the bad guys at bay, which players can customize with various offensive and defensive components. These include various guns, a laser sword, missile launchers, riot shields, boosters, and more.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When you're not blasting apart enemies, you'll take care of your homestead. This rundown garage can be upgraded with new supply and water lines, and you can grow food, raise animals, and manufacture ammo for your mech.</p>

<p>Bounty Star will arrive on PlayStation and Xbox platforms (launching day one on Game Pass), Switch, and PC and launches&nbsp;in 2023.</p>]]></summary>

      <p>Kentucky Route Zero has become one of the last decade's most celebrated narrative adventure games. As such, fans will be happy to know that developer Cardboard Computer is hard at work on its next title.</p>

<p>A dev diary during today's Annapurna Showcase doesn't reveal much about the game, including its title. We get shots of the team members animating a dog's face, with the designers saying the next game will feature fully-animated characters. It also explains the project has a faster tempo and sports funnier writing&nbsp;than KRZ but will ultimately be a tragedy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Whatever this game is, it has no release window or announced platforms. You can read our review of Kentucky Route Zero <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/kentucky-route-zero/kentucky-route-zero-review-a-surreal-road-trip" target="_blank">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[SATA SSDs are getting increasingly affordable, with even capacious 2TB models going down in price rapidly as NVMe drives approach parity with the slower SATA drives. This makes it a good time to pick up a SATA drive for desktops or laptops that can't accommodate another M.2 drive, especially for media or game storage where the speed difference between SATA and NVMe is minimal. 
Today, Teamgroup's imaginatively-named T-Force Vulcan Z drive is down to $128 for a 2TB model, the lowest price we can find for this size at present. 
Note that to get this price, you do need to be an Amazon Prime member - normal folk you like and me will see a price of $160 instead, alongside a reminder to 'join Prime to save $32 on this item'. You should be able to join Prime under a free trial, order the item and then cancel your Prime status to avoid a charge.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dell's G15 is one of the most affordable gaming laptops on the market, thanks to modest specs and Dell's willingness for aggressive discounts, but today we're seeing an RTX 3050 model go for an astoundingly low £441. 
To get this price, select the Ubuntu Linux 20.04 LTS operating system and use VOUCHERCODES8 at checkout. Linux is a completely free operating system, unlike Windows, so you can knock £50 off the purchase price just by ticking this box - and of course, you're free to install Windows 10 or 11 afterwards. Keys for Windows 7/8/10 work on Windows 11 too, so you probably already have a key lying around - or you can pick up a new one for less than £50 online. The whole process, from using the Windows 11 Media Creation Tool to prepare a USB install drive to reaching the desktop, only takes around 20 to 30 minutes - well worth it!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been excited to play Exoprimal, Capcom’s upcoming multiplayer dino shooter, ever since it used the phrase “unstoppable raptor horde” in one of its trailers. It is a completely unhinged combination of words that makes me giddy just thinking about them. I’ll often find myself muttering them out loud when I’m unloading the dishwasher or folding laundry. “Unstoppable raptor horde”. It’s like the season finale of language. It’s perfect.


Admittedly, prior to the existence of that phrase, I was feeling a little sceptical about Exoprimal’s existence. Not only does Capcom have - let’s say - a less than favourable track record when it comes to multiplayer titles, but as a long-term fan of Dino Crisis I was a bit miffed to see them creating a game featuring prehistoric creatures that wasn’t some kind of lavish remake of my beloved PS1 series.

While the patch's release coincides with the High School Years expansion and supports a number of its features, it also added several new elements to the ever-evolving base game. These include long-time fan requests like sexual orientation customisation, body hair options, and the return of a wants and fears system in the style of The Sims 2.

No, you've not accidentally picked up the famous detective’s opium huffing habit, these two curious characters are Sherlock and Watson’s animal counterparts in zoological adventure Lord Winklebottom Investigates.
The plucky duo, gentleman giraffe Lord Winklebottom and Doctor Frumple the hippo, have been invited to a mysterious island to sit in on a special announcement only to arrive and, by George! There’s been a bleeding murder!

Since I've been playing Monster Hunter Rise, which is largely a succession of ever escalating boss fights with big lizards, I've begun comparing these scuffles with Elden Ring's boss battles. And I reckon much of their differences come down to the simple health bar, or lack of it.

"Usually, by the time a game comes out, I've compressed it to one sexy sound bite. I haven't done that with Hob's Barrow yet," he says. "Basically, Victorian gothic horror story. That's the best way to describe it."
Originally announced as Incantamentum (Gilbert jokes that one of the reasons behind the name change is because he could never pronounce "Incantamentum" correctly), Wadjet Eye got involved after Gilbert played the Steam demo last year and emailed the developer. "I said, 'Hey, I played the demo. I really liked it. Please tell me you're going to be adding voice acting to this because it's screaming for it'," Gilbert tells me. "And he said, 'Well, we will if we can find a publisher who'll do it for us.'" So now Wadjet Eye are publishing, and Gilbert is overseeing the voice recording.
