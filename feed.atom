Unlike with the original Steam Deck’s launch, Valve say the much-upgraded OLED version arrives with ample stock, so buyers can hopefully get theirs posted out without delay. The familiar reservation system is "ready to switch on", though, should demand overwhelm supply.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stop reading this article and consider picking up Super Mario RPG on Switch. 


I'll make the same pitch I made decades ago when I came across it on the SNES: it's an all-comers RPG. No matter how much you might dislike the genre or Mario as a concept, it has plenty of ways to win you over. It's also perfect for folks newer to RPGs as a whole and there are enough hooks present for veterans.


If you're already on board or can't be swayed, there's plenty of other stuff to sift through too. Persona 5 Tactica and Bluey: The Videogame both arrive on November 17; and Howl, Backpack Hero, Passpartout 2: The Lost Artist, and Enjoy the Diner all came out as a result of the recent Indie World Showcase.

We are but one day away from the release of Super Mario RPG on Switch and the tech experts at Digital Foundry have appeared just in the nick of time with their analysis of what we can expect from the remake's performance.
Let's start off with the biggie. Super Mario RPG on Switch targets and maintains 60fps almost all of the time. Digital Foundry's analysis particularly praises the video cutscenes in this respect, calling it "the best example of video playback on the entire system".

Some folks get pumped whenever they see a new Pokémon. Others just want to see a few dozen Slimes and a Goonache Goodie, which looks like a little chocolate-stuffed croissant with a secret. Visions of flowery dragons and a bouncing Croc-a-Bugle-Doo —which is literally a crocodile with a bugle for a nose — dance in your mind. A Great Sabrecub snoozes and a Dracky flits about as David Attenborough-esque narration paints the full picture.

        <updated>2023-11-16T15:51:40.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It doesn't feel that long ago since Nvidia launched its RTX 4000 "Ada Lovelace" range. In fact, the 4090 only came out last October. However, there's a chance that Team Green may be halting production of two of its products.


That's according to a post on Board Channels (as spotted by Videocardz), which states that Nvidia has allegedly "discontinued" the RTX 4070 Ti and RTX 4080. The information goes on to say that the "last distribution of goods in the 2023Q4 quarter has ended."


Image via Videocardz (source: Board Channels)


While the rumor has not been confirmed, one reason behind this could be so Nvidia can concentrate on newer models in the 4000 range. This could be in relation to the alleged RTX 4080 SUPER as well as a potential 4070 Ti SUPER.


Something could be lost in translation


As the report from Videocardz notes, there's no real way to verify whether this information is 100% accurate or not. There may be some miscommunication going on here. It's possible that what's being said is referring to a temporary hold on mass production of the RTX cards, as opposed to fully discontinuing the SKUs.


As always with these things, it's best to temper any immediate judgements you may have. Nvidia will hopefully come forward with official word on what's true and what isn't.


This current generation of graphics cards is only a year old (or just over) so it probably wouldn't make sense for a tech firm to completely discontinue products. More stock may be put into some SUPER variants, but it doesn't seem likely that Nvidia would cease production of two of its graphics cards at this point.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The ocean planet of GUP-14 is not a happy place. Its seabed has been gunked up with piles of trash, globs of purple gunge and nasty clouds of micro-plastics, all because an industrial megacorp couldn't be bothered to clean up after themselves after bleeding it for resources. That megacorp's since upped sticks to, sadly, continue their terrible ways somewhere else in the solar system, but calling out these bad practices (beyond them being obviously bad and not good for the planet) is not really Loddlenaut's concern here. 
Rather, your job is to simply clean up this mess with your array of high-tech gadgetry, healing its polluted environments so: a) it's not a grim, purple hellscape anymore; b) native, axolotl-like loddle creatures can move back in and prosper. It's simple, satisfying work that's designed to make you feel warm and fuzzy inside without having to think too hard. But its straightforward, frictionless tale may leave some wishing it had just a little more bite, and less of a sense that you're laying the ground for some other faceless corpo power to go and splurge all over it again.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[2023 has been an utterly miserable time to be working in the video game industry. Announcements of layoffs from some of the biggest names around have been dominating news sections lately. While we already knew Embracer Group was one of them, we now know the figures.


In the most recent sales report from the Crystal Dynamics and Gearbox Software owner, the company has said it experienced a 13% increase in net sales between July and September of this year (Q2 of their 2023-2024 fiscal year).




It then goes on to acknowledge that "around 900" people were part of the "reduction in headcount." This equates to 5% of the whole workforce. That's quite an astonishing amount of people to let go. Embracer Group said it's also "reduced the number of projects" being worked on and is focussing on "improving the projected return on investment within PC/Console."


At least the company is doing well...


The report goes on to say that CEO Lars Wingeford would like to "put on record a special thanks to the people who have left Embracer in the quarter." Unfortunately, it's unlikely to bring much comfort to those who have lost their jobs.


We already knew that developers under Embracer's umbrella were being targeted for mass layoffs. However, this latest report really hammers home the extent to which studios have been affected by these "reductions."


You've heard this story dozens of times already. Ubisoft, Team17, Naughty Dog, Amazon, CD Projekt Red, and many more have all been involved in redundancies, many to the tune of hundreds. One wonders whether anyone would still be interested in seeking a career in game development after all this.

The latest Japanese charts are in from Famitsu (via Gematsu) and it has been yet another strong one for Super Mario Bros. Wonder, which once again out-jumps the competition to land in the top spot with another 65,017 copies sold.
While Mario's latest 2D adventure closes in on the one milly mark in Japan, it has been a noticeably good week for PlayStation with the releases of Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III hitting both the PS4 and PS5 to dominate the top half of the charts. Like A Dragon's next-gen launch narrowly misses out on the top spot with 63,319 sales, while Call of Duty's PS5 release lands in fourth with 22,132.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Afterlife sim.
There’s no shortage of games where you have to cleanse a town of ghosts. But do those games let you cleanse the ghosts themselves? Spirittea does. Canadian solo developer Cheesemaster brings us this Japanese- and Korean-inspired afterlife sim. It’s a brew of Spirited Away, Stardew Valley, and other things that mostly goes down well, albeit with a few harder-to-swallow bits.
You create a character with limited customisation, and you’re told you’re a writer moving to a small town to focus on your book. As you settle in, you realise there are some odd occurrences that the locals can’t understand or explain. You’re given tea leaves which, when brewed in the teapot left by the previous resident, grant you ‘spirit vision’, the ability to see spirits invisible to the naked eye. Guided by Wonyan – a cat-like spirit guide who’s, well, catty – you’ll uncover some ghostly goings-on, and find the lost spirits causing them.

The game, developed with original Flashback creator Paul Cuisset, is a direct sequel to the 1992 Amiga original while presumably ignoring the events of Fade to Black, a 1995 sequel developed by Delphine Software International.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sonic has been enjoying renewed popularity in recent years thanks to the two Sonic the Hedgehog movies that have become some of the highest-grossing video game adaptations. Sega hopes to capitalize on this by bringing more of its franchises to a non-gaming audience. 


In an interview with CNBC, Sega's chief operating officer Shuji Utsumi revealed that the platforms they are considering include movies and even Roblox. The second Sonic movie grossed an impressive $405.4 million, so it's no surprise that they hope to replicate this success with its other IPs. 


IPs that are being considered include Like a Dragon (previously known as Yakuza). An adaption could be a hit, as it already has a huge following. As Sega reveals, the franchise has sold 21.1 million units.


Persona may also find itself on more platforms. It's easy to imagine it being adapted to a film series or even a television series, as the franchise already features gripping narratives and plenty of relationships and friendships to explore.

Sega denies acquisition rumors


There have been rumors that Microsoft is keen to purchase Sega, but Utsumi denies this. He explains that several companies are interested in acquiring Sega, and though it is an honor, he doesn't believe that "kind of transaction is going to happen."


This doesn't mean that Sega isn't planning to make some acquisitions for itself. Utsumi claims the company is still looking for growth during a time when Japanese studios are doing well while "European studios are struggling" following the post-COVID-19 sales decline. 


We've seen some of the effects of this through the seemingly endless waves of layoffs that have struck the industry. Utsumi remains optimistic, and he believes that the future is bright so long as "you have solid development studios and also solid IPs."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Assassin's Creed: Mirage features many beloved elements from earlier franchise titles while presenting many modern conveniences. Disappointingly, New Game+ wasn't present at launch, though Ubisoft will fix that soon.


The New Game+ mode update will hit AC: Mirage in December. It's free for all players, and it'll also include a permadeath mode to test the best assassins. We don't know what else the update will bring, but Ubisoft promises that more details will follow soon. 




Mirage follows Basim as he goes from a petty thief and pickpocketer to a deadly assassin. It is set in Baghdad, and the region is filled to the brim with gorgeous sights and well-hidden collectibles. For players who want to experience the ancient city again but don't want to lose all their upgrades, the update will be a godsend. 


The trend of games not launching with a New Game+ mode is an increasingly annoying and increasingly common problem. Fortunately, it wasn't enough to completely ruin Mirage, and upon launching, it received relatively good reviews from critics who appreciated the more streamlined approach it takes. 


Things are quite busy in the Assassin's Creed world, as AC: Nexus VR launches on November 16 on the Meta Quest 2 and 3. A new mainline titled codenamed Red is also in the works. It's set in Japan, which satisfies a desire many fans have had for the franchise for years.

In South Korea, where pirate movies and careless clicks turn innocent teenagers into crazed gambling addicts, anti-piracy messaging may have hit the jackpot.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Thaumaturge has been delayed from its original December 5 release date to February 20, 2024, announced publisher 11 Bit Studios and developer Fool’s Theory. The delay is to give the game “some additional time in development,” according to a press release sent to Destructoid.


“As the finishing touches were put on the game over recent weeks, the team saw the opportunity to add more polish and quality, and given they have the comfort to allow themselves some extra time the decision was made to delay,” the press release said.




It’d seem the delay is mostly applicable to the PC version of The Thaumaturge, though it is said that the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series versions will be coming “at a later date.”


For those out of the loop, The Thaumaturge follows — you guessed it — a thaumaturge named Wiktor Szulski, who is sent on a quest to cope with the metaphorical skeletons in his past. 


“Unfolding in 1905 Warsaw, the story revolves around the complex theme of inner demons and how in this world that can mean more than just a mental burden,” according to the press release.


It’s worth noting that aside from The Thaumaturge, Fool’s Theory is also concurrently working on the upcoming remake of CD Projekt Red’s The Witcher. The remake was announced in October 2022, and is being “rebuilt from the ground up in Unreal Engine 5,” according to the announcement. Fool’s Theory also assisted Larian Studios with “gameplay and tools programming support” on the recently released Baldur’s Gate 3.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Get ready for another rollercoaster of emotions, because the next full romance visual novel from Clannad and Kanon developer Key has been announced. 


The studio's new game is titled anemoi (via Gematsu) and so far we know some of the main staff members behind it. Kai is directing and writing the scenario, with Yuu Nijima, Hasama, and Shun Sayuki joining in on writing duties. Kai has worked on a bunch of Key projects, including scenario writing for Clannad, Air, and Kud Wafter, among others. Shinji Orito is the music producer, while Na-Ga, Humuyun, Yuunon Nagayama, and Ao Kimishima are handling key animation. 


Many of the details for anemoi have yet to be divulged, including release date and platforms. We'll know more soon, though, because an announcement stream is set to go live on November 17 starting at 7:00 p.m. Japan Time. While we wait, you can check out a brief teaser below.




The key to your heart


Key has been working in the visual novel space since 1999, and has released titles both with and without adult content. The studio's first two works, Kanon and Air, both originally launched as adult games, while games like Clannad aimed for a wider audience from the outset. Many of their works also made the leap to anime and manga adaptations over the years. Since the teaser video doesn't offer much outside of a lightly animated visual, we'll have to wait and see what kind of notes anemoi plans to hit.

Dredge has more claim to the category of indie. Its publisher, Team17, considers itself an "indie publisher," a label not exclusive to them. However, Team17 is a publicly traded company that raked in over 137 million pounds in 2022. At what point is a publisher no longer considered an indie publisher? That's hard to say.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony has announced a strong assortment of titles headed to PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium subscribers in the Game Catalog this November, including several PlayStation Classics being added with glow-ups included.


The headliners this month, outside of the Classics games, are likely Dragon’s Dogma: Dark Arisen and Teardown. Teardown is a day-and-date release for PlayStation Plus subscribers. The sandbox title launches November 15 and was wonderfully broken down via a recent launch trailer narrated by Owen Wilson himself. 




Do your homework ahead of Dragon's Dogma 2


Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen is a port of the PlayStation 4 version of the game that earned a 78 on Metacritic. It's a 2016 action RPG from Capcom where you'll explore a large open world with a trio of AI companions. This…]]></summary>

While the game is unabashedly a Ubisoft-styled open-world game, our preview confirmed that "Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora [feels] like an accurate representation of playing as Na’vi in the world of Pandora." So fans of the franchise should have reason to be excited. Now, they know the experience isn't over once the initial credits roll. 




The Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora Season Pass consists of three main parts: the Familiar Echoes bonus quest, The Sky Breaker story pack 1, and Secrets of the Spires story pack 2. Familiar Echoes will be av…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you’ve been itching for more of The Witcher, CD Projekt Red has announced that an official mod editor for The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is coming in 2024. Not much more was said about this mod editor, though it was said that it’ll be free upon release.




“It will allow you to create your own experiences in the game by making something completely new or editing existing quests and content,” the post said. In the replies, one user asked if the mod editor would be coming to consoles in addition to PC, to which it replied that it’ll only be available for PC.




There’s no hint given as to when in 2024 this mod editor will be available, though the series’ account said more news would be shared “next year."


In any case, fans of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt are very excited for the chance to build their own content in the game. As a preview of what we can hope to expect when the mod editor drops, fans took it upon themselves to photoshop Geralt’s horse, Roach, out of the provided image and replace it with a fish and a bug, and the same user posted an image of Geralt shaking hands with Jason, of Friday the 13th fame.


I can’t wait until we can ride through The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt atop the most noble of steeds, Thomas the Tank Engine. You know it’ll happen, I know it’ll happen. And I can’t wait to see it.

By any measure, the PlayStation Portal is a very targeted and specific-use product, and it’s worth clarifying out of the gate: This is not a standalone console in any way. Rather, the Portal allows you to connect to a PS5 you already have in your home over your Wi-Fi network (or any Wi-Fi network) and play the games you have downloaded on that PS5 from other places around your home.

At the end of the week, Nintendo will release the very last of its 2023 first-party Switch line-up with Super Mario RPG, a faithful remake of the 1996 SNES classic.
Judging from our own review, it looks like Nintendo is closing out the year with a bang, as we've awarded the remake a score of 9/10, noting that it "sets a new standard for how to do a faithful remake right". We highlighted the gorgeous new visuals and soundtrack, the excellent combat, and the post-game content, but noted that it might prove a bit too easy for some.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stairway Games and Humble Games have launched their crowdfunded life/farm sim, Coral Island, out of Early Access and into full release. It’s currently available on PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, with a Switch version coming later.


Looking at Coral Island, I mostly just see a tropical Stardew Valley. Not that that’s entirely a bad thing. Stardew Valley itself was essentially just a Harvest Moon done better. What matters here is that there are 25 damned singles in this game to romance. Now, if you’re like me, you have one question on your mind now. That mermaid princess. Can you romance her?


According to my research, not right now, but maybe later. So, you may want to hold off if your singular feature of attraction is half-fish. Still, that’s a pretty large pool of marriage candidates.




Coral Island was released into early access last year following a successful Kickstarter campaign. In that time, it has already racked up some acclaim for its take on the farm sim genre. Beyond building your farm, you can also spelunk some caverns, help restore a coral reef, or take part in community events.


Sounds like a fun time. I was thinking of starting a new game of Stardew Valley, but I will probably give this one a try instead.


Hold on, can you romance the merguy? Damn, that’s not coming until later, either.


Coral Island is available now for PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PS5. It will be coming to Switch at a later date.

Mario, the world's favourite platforming plumber, has done everything — kart racing, tennis, golf, partying, and a little bit of turn-based RPG-ing.
1996 saw Mario's RPG debut in the Super NES favourite, Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars, and since then, he's starred in 14 different RPGs (plus three remakes). Sometimes he'll partner up with his brother in the Mario & Luigi subseries, while other times, he'll get all crafty in the Paper Mario series.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you haven’t heard by now, Metal Gear Solid’s Master Collection - which includes the first proper outing for MGS3: Snake Eater on PC - is a bit of a mess. Lacking graphics options, suffering from visual limitations and crashes, and generally barebones as a package, the catalogue of the first three Metal Gear Solid titles and their two Metal Gear prequels hasn’t exactly gone down well with players.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Larian Studios has posted on Twitter that to reassure fans that the Xbox port of Baldur’s Gate 3 is still on track for a December release. However, the exact date won’t be revealed until The Game Awards on December 7.




Baldur’s Gate 3 was released on PC on August 3 and on PS5 on September 6 to tremendous acclaim. It is currently nominated for multiple awards at the show, including Game of the Year. Xbox exclusive gamers seem to be very eager to learn of a more solid release date because the upcoming Xbox release has been brought up by the developer multiple times, including a few days ago when they talked about the optimization breakthroughs they made.


I’m also uncertain why the release date announcement is being held off until so late into the release window. It doesn’t leave a whole lot of time for people to start booking off work for it. Maybe it will stealth drop during the show, or perhaps it will drop on December 24, giving you more reason to ignore your family during the holidays.


I picked up Baldur’s Gate 3 on PC during Early Access, so this announcement isn’t for me. I don’t even own an Xbox Series console. However, if you’re an Xbox gamer, you can get hyped for the game’s impending release. It’s happening. Really. Larian wants you to know this.


Baldur’s Gate 3 is currently available for PC and PS5. It will launch on Xbox Series X|S consoles sometime in December. We’ll find out more during the Game Awards on December 7, 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hamster and Taito have announced that the next game for the Arcade Archives is 1992’s DinoRex. The title was initially part of the Taito Milestones 2 collection, but on November 16, it will be available separately.


As someone who appreciates kusoge, I loved the Taito Milestones 2 collection because it contained a bunch of terrible games amongst its gems. DinoRex was the one that captivated me the most because it is just so, so bad. It sort of feels like a bad attempt at Primal Rage. You control a cave guy who orders a dinosaur to fight other dinosaurs. Big, chubby dinosaurs who look like they were ripped from 1933’s King Kong. Little harmless-looking toy dinosaurs.


It controls like absolute butt, which kind of adds to the charm. But on top of that, if your dinosaurs get really into it, there’s a bunch of fun level destruction. Then, there are bonus dream vignettes where your dinosaur lives out their fantasy of stomping around in modern cities. It is absolutely incredible.


I’m not saying it’s good, but if you also appreciate playing crappy games, DinoRex is top-tier. I cannot express how amazingly awful this game is, and I really think you should check it out for yourself.


DinoRex will be joining the Arcade Archives series on Switch and PS4 on November 16

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Analogue has announced that the next in their line-up of limited edition Analogue Pocket colors. This time, they’re revisiting the rainbow of Game Boy consoles. Even Game Boy Light.


When the Game Boy was first released in 1989, it came in one color, and that was grey. In 1995, they released the “Play It Loud” line-up of colors. They came in red, green, blue, yellow, black and clear. When the Game Boy Pocket came out in 1996, it came in similar colors, plus a few more, such as pink. This run of Analogue Pockets comes in all these colors, plus the Indigo and Spice of the Game Boy Advance, but minus the colors that they’ve already covered, such as clear and black.


This year has seen the boutique handheld get released in a number of limited edition colors, and usually, they sell out almost immediately. The handheld uses FPGA hardware emulation to recreate classic handheld consoles with as much accuracy as possible while adding modern comforts. While it works with Game Boy games out of the box, there are adapters for other consoles, such as the Atari Lynx and even the Turbografx.


Pre-orders open up on November 17th, and the consoles will ship on November 20th. They’re priced at $249 USD compared to a non-limited version at $219.


Meanwhile, I’m still waiting for my Analogue Duo to ship.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Naheulbeuk’s Dungeon Master is a staff management game disguised as a dungeon management game. At the start of each week, your minions might choose to go on strike, demanding everything from more cells in the prison to fewer dwarves in the workplace. If that second example elicited a startled little “yikes”, then good, you’re paying attention. Your minions are also occasional racists – which at least makes some of the more brutal options at hand for dealing with striking workers more palatable.


You can sacrifice the entire picket line to your in-house demon lord, or terminate their employment without tribunal. You can also lock them up in those prisons they repeatedly claim are so lacking in cells. Or you can agree to their terms to expand the canteen and sack all of their shortest colleagues. But no matter which option you choose, minion strikes are inconsequential, only ever amounting to a comedy aside. Just as the turn-based Dungeon Of Naheulbeuk set out to skewer D&D, Naheulbeuk’s Dungeon Master is a brave and self-aware parody of dungeon management games. But it's far too barebones to invest in seriously.

Following in the wake of Microsoft, Epic, CD Projekt, Sony and, well, take your pick, the company aim to cut roughly 30% of their workforce to shore up profits. The specific reasoning here is that Digital Bros think that people aren't interested in playing original new games; they'd rather get to grips with fictions and franchises they know and love already. As such, the company plan to "limit" their big budget projects in future, though no specific cancellations have been announced.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When it comes to open-world zombie survival experiences, many can't claim to be as brutal and unforgiving as DayZ. Bohemia Interactive's dystopian food scavenger simulator is still going strong, but recently it hit its biggest player count on Steam.


As spotted by PC Gamer, data from SteamDB shows that the game recently hit an all-time peak of 69,449 players. That's an impressive number for a relatively small game that's been around since 2012.




Beginning life as a mod for Arma 3, DayZ was launched as a standalone title in 2018, envisioning a cruel world. A world in which the dead that roam the land are the least of your worries when you can't find food and are being shot at by trigger-happy players.


So why the increase in popularity now?


A lot of games experience peaks and troughs in terms of concurrent player counts. However, for something that's over a decade old to reach a new peak is an interesting one.


As the PC Gamer article notes, DayZ's most recent update could be a large factor as to why more people have started playing. Version 1.23 launched just over a week ago, bringing with it some new items, such as headgear and padded gloves, and a new skybox.


That might not sound like reason enough for nearly 70,000 people to want to jump into the game. However, what you might not be considering is that this is a title all about embracing the tiny things; the dirty trousers with the extra pocket space, a rotten pear that could save you from starvation, and, in this case, a different sky to look at.


In any case, it's inspired me to reinstall DayZ, because nothing relaxes me more than outrunning zombies as I frantically seek out a zucchini.

Villi explains how he landed the role over a decade ago. He claims he was already familiar with Remedy in 2005, and he went for an audition for the studio. Not long after, he got a call from Sam Lake and found himself as the protagonist of Alan Wake. 


It's no easy feat playing Alan, as separate people perform the character's voice and motion capture. While Villi handles the motion capture, Matthew Poretta voices the writer. Achieving this requires fine-tuned coordination, as Villi has to ensure his performance matches the voice a…]]></summary>

I’m exaggerating – for effect! – but there genuinely are some chunky savings to be had here, even on the very latest graphics cards with enhanced ray tracing and DLSS 3 support. It’s not just super-duper-high-end cards like the RTX 4080 that are getting cuts, either – the early deals I’ve found so far cover more affordable and/or mid-range far as well, like the Intel Arc A750 and RTX 4060 Ti.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It may be a while until we see a new Steam Deck, but Valve's recent announcement of the OLED variant will no doubt see increased interest in the handheld PC. In fact, we can already see a bit of evidence of this, as the device is now the top-selling release on Steam at the moment.


While the Steam Deck has already been pretty high up on the list, the fact that it's now at the number one spot so soon after the OLED model unveiling is probably not a coincidence.


Screenshot by Destructoid.


Pretty much since it launched last February (it's fast approaching its second birthday already), it's been in the sights of many-a-PC gamer. But with the latest iteration of the Deck coming this week, it's likely to keep dominating the chart at least until the new year.


Some other interesting things to note


The Steam chart is a good indication of what people are playing on PC currently. The Deck's recent position at the number one spot means it's pushed Modern Warfare 3 down a notch. But let's face it, the new Call of Duty game is probably going to keep slipping based on all the reviews.


Sidetracking slightly, there's also been increased interest in Zeekerss's co-op horror game Lethal Company, which – at the time of writing – is at number four, up from 20. Interestingly-er more-so, Train Sim World 4 has experienced a massive jump, shooting up from 72 to sit comfortably at position eight.


Right, back to the Steam Deck. I've yet to purchase one myself, but hear nothing but good things about it. However, now that the OLED model is almost here, the current devices are now starting to drop in price. And a refurbished one is 20% cheaper still. Am I tight with money or just poor? You decide.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CD Projekt have announced that they're working on a free mod editor for The Witcher 3, allowing you to write entire new quests for grizzly Geralt, or just make him walk around with no trousers on, which he spends every other cutscene doing anyway. There are already many mods for the venerable fantasy RPG, of course - the options range from mods that give you Henry Cavill's face to mods that simulate the effects of long Covid to raise awareness - but the editor should make life easier for the internet's Geralt-whisperers. Better late than never.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Have you ever watched critically acclaimed 1998 comedy drama The Truman Show and thought "What if the whole city was people who didn't know they were in a TV show?". That's kind of the deal with American Arcadia, a puzzle-platformer about a dude who lives in an ultra advanced dome city that is for some reason 70s-themed, and is also a huge reality show for the Twitch generation. 
I actually love the 70s theme. This combined with story-within-a-story-within-a-story framing, bits of lovely, almost Wes Anderson-esque art design, and some extreme multi-tasking combining 2.5D and 3D makes American Arcadia an interesting little treat. Do the twists upon twists get a bit over cooked? Maybe. But you can live with it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm becoming increasingly aware that a lot of my articles are about retro or classic games. Well, I am monstrously old, after all. And on that note, if you want a more modern version of the beloved 90s RTS game Dungeon Keeper, look no further.


KeeperFX is a fan project that aims to keep Bullfrog's legendary strategy game alive and well. The website says the aim is to "preserve and expand upon the original," while bringing with it improvements to the visuals and new features.


Image via KeeperFX.


It does require an official copy of Dungeon Keeper in order to play the FX version – either through a disc (remember those?) or a downloaded copy of the Gold Edition – but the fan project itself is free.


What's featured?


Here's a quick list of what you'll find in KeeperFX: 



Windows 7/10/11 support


Higher screen resolutions


Modernized controls


Many bugfixes [sic]


Additional campaigns and maps


New level script commands


New creatures, textures and sprites


Multiplayer


And much more!



In short, it retains the general look and feel of the ol' D-to-the-K, but with some modern overhauls.


Some of you may already be aware of KeeperFX as it's technically been around since 2008. However, the latest download represents build 1.0.0, aka the "first full version." According to the site, "all original Dungeon Keeper code has been rewritten" and it's a fully open-source standalone game.


For those with nostalgia on the brain, this sounds like a neat way to experience a gaming relic of the past. And let's be honest, we haven't had much luck from the series since that awful, awful, Dungeon Keeper mobile game.

The PlayStation 5 was the best-selling console of the month, too. 
Marvel's Spider-Man 2 taking the top slot last month isn't surprising – it's the fastest-selling PlayStation Studios game ever and sold through 5 million copies in just 11 days.


Behind Marvel's Spider-Man 2 on October 2023's best-selling list is Super Mario Bros. Wonder, the latest Switch exclusive from Nintendo at-the-time, and Assassin's Creed Mirage, the shorter throwback title from Ubisoft starring Assassin's Creed Valhalla's Basim.

It released Phantom Liberty, the first and only expansion for Cyberpunk 2077, debuted its soundtrack on streaming services, revealed plans for a live-action Cyberpunk project, and just this week, nabbed four nominations for The Game Awards 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's-an-RPG!
On paper, Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars is a game that probably shouldn’t exist. It brought together Nintendo’s platforming icon with RPG giant Square in a way that seemed impossible, imbuing the denizens of the Mushroom Kingdom (and beyond) with bucketloads of personality beyond the hops, jumps, and yelps they were previously known for. It’s got humour in spades, from tongue-in-cheek jokes to characters pantomiming events whenever they retell them. It’s weird and hilarious, and it knows it — and that’s why people love it.
So it’s a darn good thing that Super Mario RPG, the Switch remake of 1996's turn-based favourite, retains the weirdness that gave the SNES original a special charm. Not a hair is out of place in this remake. We said in our preview that this is one of the most faithful HD adaptations we’ve ever played, and now that we’ve seen everything the game has to offer, we stand by that statement, and it’s all the better for it. This is a magical experience reworked to near perfection with high-definition clarity.

Oh, you’re still here. That’s understandable. After all, I don’t think you needed me to tell you that Super Mario RPG is a fun game. This unique collaboration between Nintendo and Squaresoft garnered a devoted following almost immediately upon release, and that passion from its fans endures to this day. While this is technically the origin point that led to the Paper Mario and the Mario & Luigi series, Super Mario RPG remains one of the wackiest and most surreal games the mustached plumber has ever starred in. Quite frankly, it's a miracle we’re even seeing this game again at all.

The original Super Mario RPG, released for Super Nintendo in 1996, felt like it was meant to be your first RPG. In an era when Final Fantasy tried its best to tell mature stories within the medium's limitations and Dragon Quest demanded hours and hours of your time, Mario’s adventure felt much brighter and more manageable. Familiar characters, a lighthearted story, a reasonable length, and timed button-pressing during combat made it stand out against the competition. Revisiting the game more than 25 years later in this new remade shape shows the original formula did n…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this year, it was revealed that a stop-motion animated Pokemon series is in the works. We've gotten our first trailer and it's outrageously cute. 


The Pokemon Company has partnered with Netflix to produce Pokemon Concierge. The series follows a girl named Haru (voiced by Karen Fukuhara) who begins work at a tropical Pokemon Resort. She quickly discovers just how peaceful the resort can be but it's not all relaxing, as she also has to ensure the Pokemon have a good time.  




The stop-motion is being done by Dwarf Animation which also handles My Dad the Bounty Hunter.  All the Pokemon look criminally cuddly with their felt skin and adorable cries. The trailer features a catchy theme song by Mariya Takeuchi, and it gives the impression that we'll be in for a tranquil but action-packed adventure. 


Haru will meet Tyler, Alisa, and Watanabe during her time at the Pokemon Resort. The original animated series has been running since 1997, so you aren't alone if you've had more than enough of it. This unique spin-off could be a great way to get old fans interested in the Pokemon world again.


The series has four episodes that are 14-20 minutes each. It hits Netflix on December 28.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you happen to be a medieval monk illustrator trapped in the body of a modern videogames enthusiast, you might like Howl, a turn-based strategy game from Lion Song and Flower Collectors studio Mi'pu'mi Games. It’s powered by what the developers are calling “living ink”, an art style that fills in each papery map as you play. 


The game certainly looks arresting: your cursor is a quill, the HUD is a collection of smaller parchment scraps, and the terrain is a slowly brightening wash of swirling colours, leaking beyond the outlines of trees and buildings. Lovely stuff. And what's more, you get to beat up a bunch of wolves.

Atlus, the developer behind the Persona and Shin Megami Tensei franchises, has announced that it is raising the average annual salary for its employees by 15%.
In a stark contrast to the seemingly endless lay-offs hitting the industry of late, new graduates at Atlus will see their starting salary rise by 300,000 yen (about $1,977) and all employees will see an annual salary rise of 15%. In a translated press release (thanks, Game Developer), Atlus states that the move is to ensure the company can attract and retain talent as it "promotes global expansion".

One of the many adorable-looking titles that appeared in yesterday's Indie World Showcase was Core Keeper, a mining sandbox game that will be unearthed on Switch in 2024.
There is a good level of Stardew Valley-style vibes in this pixel art farmer/builder, though this one is set in a mine — groundbreaking... literally. Developed by Pugstorm, Core Keeper will see you drawn into an ancient underground area thanks to a mysterious relic. In the hopes of one day escaping, what you do down there is up to you: you can explore the caverns, take down enemies and upgrade your skills, or collect resources to build a life for your community under the earth.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Naughty Dog has been pretty quiet on the gaming front this year, though the HBO series continues to be popular. According to Production List, filming for season 2 is scheduled to begin on January 7 next year. 


Like the prior one, season 2 will be filmed in Canada. Production List has Craig Mazin and Naughty Dog's Neil Druckmann returning as producers and writers. Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey also return, presumably reprising their roles as Joel and Ellie respectively.

What to expect from season 2 of The Last of Us


The upcoming season will be split into two parts. This makes sense for anyone familiar with The Last of Us Part 2. In a prior interview with Deadline, Mazin also discusses how the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes affected work. When it struck, they were in the middle of scriptwriting, but that had to be put on hold. 


They had gotten pretty far already, and Mazin was able to "write and submit the first episode right before the deadline hit." According to Mazin, the next season of The Last of Us is scheduled to air in 2025, though nothing is certain yet. Despite the setback, he still really wants "to try and get this show on the air when it’s supposed to be on the air." 


Mazin also gives hope that the series won't end with the second season. There are already ideas being tossed around, and he is adamant that the "show will not end with Season 2 unless people don’t watch it and we’ll get canceled." 




Many franchise fans have also been waiting for the multiplayer counterpart of The Last of Us Part 2 to launch. For a while, it seemed like the project had been scrapped but Naughty Dog game director Vinit Agarwal has confirmed he's still working on it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are plenty of mysteries to solve and secrets to uncover in Alan Wake 2. Don't forget to get to the bottom of Mayor Setter's campaign, as it comes with a surprising revelation. Alan Wake 2 spoilers are below. 


As you explore Bright Falls, you'll likely notice all of Mayor Setter's ad campaign. The ads are eye-catching, especially because despite the passionate campaign, it doesn't seem like Mayor Setter has much competition. The game does give you hints along the way regarding who the mayor is, though it's easy to not piece the story together if you're not paying enough attention.

Meeting Mayor Setter


There are six Mayor Setter ads scattered throughout Bright Falls and Watery. You'll find them on the parts of the map marked below.

By Return 6: Scratch, you will have access to all the ads, but don't go any further, or else you'll be locked out of full exploration. Find them all then head into Saga Anderson's Mind Place where you'll find a poster depicting the cutest dog. Go to Suomi Hall, and you'll discover the dog on stage, waiting to be petted. That's Mayor Setter! 


It's worth petting the dog, as you'll earn the Nice Things in Life achievement, and you'll score a charm that allows you to see all collectibles on the map. This is very useful to have if you're aiming to 100% complete the game. 




Mayor Setter has become quite popular among Alan Wake fans on Twitter and Reddit, indicating that the pup politician has a good shot at winning debates without barking a word. Petting Mayor Setter is also a nice break from the more morbid petting Saga does when she encounters taxidermy deer heads.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Europe and Australia got lucky.
After being delayed last week, Nightdive Studios' upcoming release Turok 3: Shadow of Oblivion has now been released on the Switch eShop in Europe and Australia ahead of schedule.
The game was meant to be released at the end of the month across all platforms, but due to some "recent confusion," it seems the remaster has gone live early in these regions. As a result, these versions will include a number of known bugs and are missing some quality-of-life improvements.

Of the bunch, it's vaulting - the act of clambering over a low wall - which has been greeted most feverishly by Tarkov's community, a fact which is honestly not surprising.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Perhaps the biggest highlight of Remnant 2 was its incredible world-building and design. All three core worlds—Losomn, N'Erud, and Yaesha—were so distinct and immersive that they very well could have been their own games. In the first Remnant 2 DLC, players revisit Losomn in an attempt to track down the One True King.


The new Forlorn Coast adds another variant to Losomn, making it one of the zone's three roll possibilities. The mad king thinks everyone has betrayed him, and teleports his castle smack dab in a Dran coastal town. After my roughly seven-hour journey through the new area, I was pleased with the content the DLC added to Remnant 2. To put it simply, this is just more Remnant 2, and that's not a bad thing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[10 islands enter, one island wins. The Game Awards' Geoff Keighley has orchestrated an in-game opportunity in which players can now vote on the battle royale title's best user-created island of the year.


The announcement came from Keighley this afternoon. In collaboration with Nighttimes and Studio 568, the partnership has created a hub world that Fortnite players can travel to to vote in-game on what they believe is the best original locale out there.




The in-game experience is something The Game Awards creator, Geoff Keighley, has been excited about for years:


"Ever since I hosted Live From Risky Reels in Fortnite in 2019, I’ve been thinking about ways The Game Awards could bring our celebration inside the games we play every day," said Keighley in a press release. "Our Fortnite island is the first experiment in this direction, and I’m particularly excited to help shine the spotlight on the amazing user-generated community around the world."


The Game Awards Island, located in-game at 0853-1358-8532, features 10 creator-made islands that can be voted on once a day per Epic ID. After players finish voting, they can explore the custom island to find Game Awards statues scattered throughout. If all of the statues are found, players will enjoy a nice XP boost for their efforts. 


The Game Awards Vote in Fortnite event begins today and runs until December 6 at 6:00 p.m. PT. The winning island will be revealed the following night, December 7, during The Game Awards live and within The Game Awards Fortnite island. For more The Game Awards coverage, check out all of this year's nominees here.

Well, you probably would, because it's Minecraft, the sandbox building sim that contains all possibility and all human endeavour, with the exception of good PvP mechanics, yes I went there. 


Anyway, Minecraft update 1.21 is just around the corner, and a few players have gotten early access via Mojang's snapshot releases. I had thought the crown jewel of the update would be the new Trial Chambers, aka trap-filled mazes. It turns out the real star might be the new Breeze mob - in the hands of imaginative players, at least.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Persona 5 kids are trapped in high school, their semesters stretched into infinity by the inescapable march of spin-offs that have been retroactively stuffed into every available blank spot. Since the credits rolled on Persona 5 (and also before, and sometimes concurrently), the Phantom Thieves have spent their time in a rubbish Dynasty Warriors knock-off, got lost in a dream about a really cheap rhythm-action game and ended up trapped in a cross-generational dungeon crawler. Now they find themselves embroiled in - of all things - an X-COM style turn-based strategy game. 


Your energy for Persona 5 Tactica is going to come down to how much tolerance you have for the Persona 5 brand’s Baz Luhrmann-style maximalism. If you're emotionally invested in the gang, it'll definitely help. But even if you're a Persona veteran or a total newcomer, you'll find the story a bit loose, the chats a bit tiring, and the combat a bit simplistic. Then again, if you're a Persona fan, it's still more than a good excuse to sink back into another adventure with your pals.

Persona 5 has become its own sort of mini-franchise within the Persona series. With many spin-off titles released over the years, such as Persona 5 Strikers, Persona 5: Dancing in Starlight, and Persona Q2: New Cinema Labyrinth, Atlus seems to love using Persona 5’s popularity to explore new stories and gameplay ideas. However, I applaud Atlus for making all of these spin-offs in completely different genres from each other. The latest, Persona 5 Tactica, delivers an entertaining story, a colorful cast of charact…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Making a strategy game is "harder than people give it credit for," Bit Reactor's CEO Greg Foertsch tells me. The same could probably be said of any game this year in particular, but having spent over 20 years shepherding the art teams at Firaxis on Civilization, XCOM, Sid Meier's Pirates, Alpha Centauri and most recently Marvel's Midnight Suns, Foertsch has seen firsthand what it takes for strategy games to break new ground over the years, and what an arduous road it's been for the genre to get where it is today. Not only was it "late to party on 3D, they were late to the party on consoles," but it's also "suffered from lower budgets, which means it just hasn't pushed in the way that other genres have," he says. 
Even now, "it's got some catching up to do," he continues, but there are plenty of reasons to be positive, too. As we speak at the beginning of September, our conversation quickly turns to Baldur's Gate 3, whose enormous success Foertsch cites as a clear and obvious sign that "there's a thirst for something different now," both within RPG circles and, perhaps a little unexpectedly, for strategy heads as well. It's his hope that his own upcoming project, the closely guarded Star Wars strategy game his new studio Bit Reactor are working on in collaboration with Respawn, will follow in these lauded footsteps. "We want to make a game and just have people say, 'Man, that's amazing game, and oh, it happens to be strategy.' That's the goal."

Much like The Boys, it's got a not-very-nice version of Superman, Omni-Man, who you might have seen doing not-very-nice things in Mortal Kombat lately.
Skybound and Kirkman's first videogame based on the license isn't about Omni-Man, though. Developed by Terrible Posture Games, it's about Atom Eve, a high-school do-gooder who can manipulate the atomic structure of the world, changing one thing into another.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you’ve been enjoying Jusant, Don’t Nod’s post-apocalyptic climbing sim, you might also like the alpha playtest for Chasing The Unseen, which has just been updated with a new level. It doesn’t have Jusant’s quietly innovative grip and abseiling mechanics – the climbing is closer to Shadow Of The Colossus, consisting of just one button you hold to cling on till your stamina runs out. Nor does it have the Don’t Nod game's beautifully nested chunks of backstory - no seashells you can press your ear to, alas. But it does have massive flying cephalopods, giant red mushrooms, and floating, fractured landscapes of rock and grass. 

The gameworld drifts whimsically between categories, neither macroscopic nor microscopic, at times a kind of ocean reef, and at other times, a mysterious, alternate dimension we might summarise as “Cthulhu’s Zen Chillout Room”. The climbing aside, you can glide short distances by inflating what looks like a blowfish, and there are (regular-sized) capybara to chase down and collect. When you die, the game plays a didgeridoo at you in a faintly jocular way. The whole thing pongs of quantum physics.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lies of P is one of the year's best games – read why in Game Informer's Lies of P review – and both critics and fans have enjoyed the Bloodborne/Sekiro-style take on the story of The Adventures of Pinocchio. Mustakro on Twitter has taken their enjoyment of the game's boss designs and turned some of Lies of P's toughest challenges into Cuphead-style bosses, and it rules. 


I came across Mustakro this morning, scrolling through my Twitter feed, when I saw a really awesome rendition of Lies of P's King of Puppets boss (one of the most difficult in the game) in the style of Rubberhose, which is that classic animation style popularized in the 1920s seen in Cuphead.

Then I clicked through some of Mustakro's other tweets to find even more Lies of P bosses in the style of Cuphead, and I love these renditions so much that I just wanted to share. So, enjoy their other art below:

For more about the game, read Game Informer's Lies of P review and then check out Game Informer's Lies of P Soulslike tips, tricks, secrets, and more to help Pinocchio survive Krat in Lies of P. After that, read about how a September Lies of P update included various changes to make the game easier. And finally, check out these two new images teasing Lies of P DLC.

Hard-nosed private eye Rachel (RPS in peace) pronounced herself fascinated but a little stumped by it, back in April, while Graham described it as his "ideal game" in a post about the recent addition of infidelity cases and lost-and-found jobs, adding to my suspicions that Graham is some kind of jigsaw killer and that his news posts are actually ciphered confessions of his terrible crimes.
Well, these already viscous plots are about to thicken into a borderline-immobile soup of intrigue, for ColePowered Games are adding modding tools to the game. These will allow you to pen your own detective mysteries, and even alter the surrounding city to fit.

Call of Duty cycles through its lineup of villains on a yearly basis. Sometimes it's Nazis, other times it's Russian nationalists or zombies. But the most dangerous threat is one without a lust for brains or access to weapons of war; it's stagnation.

Logitech's K400 Plus is a popular model in this niche category, and normally retails for an affordable $28. Today though, it's down to $19 on Amazon, a sweet 32% discount that makes it near impulse buy territory for anyone that has a PC for which a regular mouse and keyboard setup isn't quite convenient.

In other words: when will Trespasser finally get the respect it deserves?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After months of character reveals, Tekken 8 has announced the final fighter of its launch roster: Reina. This brand-new character sports a lightning-quick moveset, earning her the nickname “Purple Lightning," and has mysterious ties to the Mishima clan.
Bandai Namco states that little is known about Reina's history besides she’s a student of the Mishima Polytechnical School. For some reason, she really wants to fight Jin (move over, Hwoarang), and based on her gameplay trailer, she seems more than capable of taking him on. Check Reina out in action below. 


With Reina’s addition, the 32-fighter roster is now complete. Here’s the full list of characters, with new fighters denoted and links to applicable articles/trailers:
Alisa Bosconovitch
Asuka Kazama
Azucena Milagros Ortiz Castillo (New)
Bryan Fury
Claudio Serafino
Devil Jin
Feng Wei
Hwoarang
Jack-8 (New)
Jin Kazma
Jun Kazama
Kazuya Mishima/Devil Kazuya
King
Kuma
Lars Alexandersson
Lee Chaolan
Leo Kliesen
Leroy Smith
Lili Rochefort
Ling Xiaoyu
Marshall Law
Nina Williams
Panda
Paul Phoenix
Raven
Reina (New)
Sergei Dragunov
Shaheen
Steve Fox
Victor Chevalier (New)
Yoshimitsu
Zafina
Additionally, the game's first Season of post-launch DLC will add four unannounced fighters. These characters will be released separately each season throughout 2024, with the first arriving sometime in the spring. 
Tekken 8 launches on January 26 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. Check our early hands-on impressions of the game here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Amazon is laying off 180 jobs in its games division, hopping on the tragically overcrowded bandwagon of layoffs in the game industry this year. The news comes via Aftermath, which reports that the layoffs are focused in two areas – the Crown Twitch channel, which will reportedly be eliminated altogether, and the game growth teams. Employees were notified of the changes through an email from Christoph Hartman, VP of Amazon Games. This is the second wave of layoffs this division of the company has faced this year.
An excerpt of the announcement email can be read below:
There have been so many layoffs in the gaming industry this year that it's getting hard to keep track of. Last week, we learned Free Radical Design is on the verge of closing down and that Ubisoft laid off more than 100 employees. The week before that, roughly 100 employees were laid off at Destiny 2 developer Bungie. 
In January, Microsoft laid off 10,000 employees amidst its ongoing $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard, which it completed last month. 
In August, Striking Distance Studios, the team behind last year's The Callisto Protocol, laid off more than 30 employees, and that same month, Mass Effect and Dragon Age developer BioWare laid off 50 employees, including long-time studio veterans. The following month, in September, Immortals of Aveum developer Ascendant Studios laid off roughly 45% of its staff. 
Just last month, The Last of Us developer Naughty Dog laid off at least 25 employees, and Telltale Games underwent layoffs as well, although an actual number of laid-off employees has not yet been revealed. And in late October, Dreams developer Media Molecule laid off 20 employees.
The hearts of Game Informer's staff are with the people laid off from Amazon Games, along with everyone else who has lost a job this year.

While the throwback 3D platforming adventure looked great in its own right, what caught a lot of people's attention was the team behind it. Evening Star's creative director and lead engine architect is Christian Whitehead, one of the lead developers behind 2017's Sonic Mania. Whitehead isn't alone, though, as various other Evening Star developers also worked on Sonic Mania. While we've still got some time before the game's release – it's due out sometime in 2024 – Game Informer has a special sneak peek at its music and can exclusively reveal three tracks from the game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alan Wake and Control developers Remedy Entertainment have announced that their untitled co-op shooter, the artist formerly known as project Vanguard, will no longer be a free-to-play game - largely, it seems, because the free-to-play business is looking a bit dicey. The game has been given a new codename to celebrate: Kestrel. It's still a co-op multiplayer affair, however.


The reboot follows an evaluation period during which Remedy and publisher Tencent discussed a proof-of-concept version of the game, as we reported last month. They've now kicked it back to the concept phase "due to uncertainties in creating a successful game [in] the rapidly changing free-to-play market and associated risks". A few members of the old Vanguard development team have moved to other Remedy projects, while the core leadership and certain select developers carry on with Kestrel.

November 13, 2023
As with every Indie World Showcase, the question must be asked: is this the time where we finally see Hollow Knight: Silksong, the Hollow Knight sequel from developer Team Cherry that began life as a DLC to the original game? It probably won't be but it's always fun to get your hopes up a little bit so that they may be gently crushed. 
Tomorrow's Indie World Showcase for Nintendo Switch begins at Noon ET. 
In the meantime, read Game Informer's Hollow Knight review and then check out everything announced during the last Indie World Showcase, which was held in April, for a glance at what to potentially expect with tomorrow's. 
What game do you hope to see tomorrow during the Nintendo Indie World Showcase? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Studio Ghibli's Spirited Away is a film about a spoilt young girl who is obliged to work at a bathhouse for supernatural creatures, after her parents are turned into pigs by a wicked witch. Spirittea from Edmonton, Canada-based Cheesemaker Games is Spirited Away in the guise of a Stardew Valley-style management sim. Released today, it casts you as a wholesome young entrepreneur who has just arrived in a town full of rogue supernatural creatures. To free the town from its spectral infestation, you must renovate an old mountain bathhouse and treat each phantom to a jolly good scrub. You might also need to deal with some Unfinished Business, such as tracking down a lost possession. At least there's no witch to worry about. That I know of, anyway.


I have fond memories of Spirited Away - it was the film that re-introduced me to anime as an undergraduate, following the traditional early-career middlebrow otaku phase of obsessing over Akira, Cowboy Bebop and Ghost in the Shell while turning my nose up at stuff like Naruto, because it's "just for kids". I was on the brink of pitching a Spirittea review, but then our reviews editor Ed Thorn emerged howling and gibbering from the floorboards and asked me to review a 100-hour RPG instead (won't spoil), so I'll have to settle for trying the demo.

I would like to propose an analogous theory for horror games and cute games whereby past a certain point of cuteness, the videogame in question teeters over dramatically into dread and nausea. We could call it the "horseshuwu effect".


As evidence of this, please witness the unholy magnificence of Saccharinity of Starfield, a Starfield mod from lucyprrrr and the Sakura Candy Society, which treats Starfield's items, spaceships, buildings, vegetation, planet models and, worst of all, people to a barbie-doll makeover reminiscent of a seriously overclocked shoujo anime. Do you like pink? No you don't. Not this much.

Looking at you, Starfield and Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty. Little scamps.

As such, I'm tickled gall-bladder-pink to hear that Blizzard consider the action-RPG series "a wonderful platform" for different types of game, now that they've made the leap to an open world format. 


For the most part, said experimentation will occur in the course of Diablo 4 expansions - the first of which, Diablo 2 throwback Vessel of Hatred, will launch in late 2024, adding a new class to the game described as "never before seen in the Diablo universe". But from the sounds of things, there's scope for the "franchise in general" to evolve too.

So it is in Mob Factory, a blend of tower defense and factory management in which you quickly set up defenses against waves of worms, spiders, skeletons and so forth - and then set up spawners to create more waves, so you can turn their fallen remains into conveyor belts, walls, and eventually new islands to expand your monster-chewing factories upon. It just came out on Steam.

Enter KeeperFx, a long-running open source project to make the original Dungeon Keeper run at higher resolutions, with widescreen support, improved AI, online multiplayer, modern controls and user-made levels. After fifteen years of on-off development, it just hit 1.0.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Roadwarden's creator, the Polish writer and designer Aureus of Moral Anxiety Studio, is an enthusiastic and inventive player of table-top games. Many of his ideas for 2022's finest historical fantasy RPG have their twitching, eldritch roots in pen-and-paper sessions with friends. Take questions of money and wealth. Speaking to me over Zoom one rainy October afternoon, Aureus recalls one particular table-top campaign he ran in which, after 10 or so sessions, the player party had sunk into abject poverty. "They reached a collapsed village, [and] they said, 'is there a cart around here?' So I rolled the dice and decided that all right, there is a wagon, that's completely functional with all its wheels and so on. So they just started to walk around and shove on the top of their wagon, whatever of value they could find. 


"They had no shame!" Aureus goes on. "Just gathering all the scraps of iron, all the tools, knives, musical instruments, pieces of fabric - anything they could find, they were just taking it all with them on the assumption that whenever they reached a civilised spot, they're just going to sell it all."  This was foolhardy behaviour, because all the objects in question were trash with little resale value. "So they at the same time they had more than they could ever need, and they had pretty much nothing. They mainly had a hindrance that was slowing them down - this wagon full of stuff was just difficult to move through the paths."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Before Insomniac created its stellar Spider-Man trilogy and before Treyarch redefined web-swinging with the 2004 Spider-Man 2 movie tie-in game, the folks at Neversoft gave Spidey fans the best example of wall-crawling video game excellence with its 2000 take on the character. Spider-Man sees the friendly neighborhood hero battle a star-studded gallery of villains in an original adventure chock full of comic book goodness. As Spider-Man's first fully 3D action-adventure game, it laid the groundwork for mechanics such as web-swinging, a variety of web shooter attacks, and wall-crawling stealth gameplay. Let's see how it holds up 23 years later.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This past weekend was a big one for Blizzard, as its yearly BlizzCon event brought news across several properties, including World of Warcraft, Overwatch, and Diablo. In the wake of the expansion announcement and seasonal reveals that rolled out about Diablo IV, we had the chance to speak with Diablo franchise manager Rod Fergusson and game director Joe Shely. We asked about the studio’s development processes post-launch, the specifics of gathering and responding to fan feedback and criticism, and the most critical priorities for Diablo IV in the months following launch.

Game Informer: With the acknowledgment that it’s very different individuals and teams involved, on a studio level I’m curious if there are things about the post-launch support for Diablo III that are now being put into us…]]></summary>

It comes courtesy of Aerothorn, who asks: What is your favorite co-op gaming memory? (along with the additional clarification that these memories don't need to be confined to designed-for-co-op games, but could also stem from playing a single-player game with a friend. "I used to play Descent with me piloting and my friend gunning!" they said).
So which games make us think of happy times with pals and good company? Come and find out below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Speaking to investors in an earnings call this week, GTA 6 publisher Take-Two's CEO Strauss Zelnick had a bit to say about the eternally uncontroversial topic of videogame prices. In news worth holding the press for, he thinks they're pretty cheap for what you get in return.
Zelnick cautioned one investor against "generalising" about the state of game pricing based on the recent fortunes of TV and movie subscription services like Netflix, which have had to increase subscription fees to match their expenses after underpricing themselves initially to grow their audiences. Videogames might be all about subscription services these days, Zelnick said, but that doesn't mean they are subject to the same commercial logics as ye olde non-interactive media. In particular, it doesn't mean publishers are currently able to raise videogame prices, even if they feel like they're overdelivering.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Put your sleuthing caps on, detectives—it’s time to solve some mysteries! We are proud to announce that a whole batch of HeR Interactive’s Nancy Drew games are now ready for public testing:
In Nancy Drew: Stay Tuned for Danger, a soap opera star needs your help in uncovering who is behind a series of death threats that sound a little too real for comfort. 
Nancy Drew: Message in a Haunted Mansion has you helping out with repairs in a Victorian mansion. However, a series of strange accidents, plus some murmurings of a ghost haunting, quickly threaten to turn this renovation into an investigation.
In Nancy Drew: Treasure in the Royal Tower a failed ski vacation at an eccentric castle with even more eccentric inhabitants soon turns into a quest to uncover a lost piece of the history of the French Revolution.
And if you’re looking for something more thrilling, in Nancy Drew: The Final Scene, you will find yourself racing against the clock to find your kidnapped friend, while also saving a historical theater with more than a fair share of secrets from demolition.
The games are available for purchase through HeR Interactive’s website or Steam (Stay Tuned for Danger is not available on Steam, however). Or if you already own a CD copy of the games, their English and Russian variants will also work. To play them with ScummVM, you will need a daily development build. As always, if you encounter any issues, please submit a bug report to our issue tracker.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The fake video games in movies and TV shows can be difficult to understand, for an obvious reason: they're not real games. Their function is providing a few seconds of motion, colours, and noises, and possibly a premise for a plot to riff on. They don't need to be coherent or good. Still, sometimes these glimpses and ideas are interesting enough that I quite enjoy trying to figure them out. Take Gods Of Combat, a fake first-person shooter featured in police procedural show Criminal Minds. Apparently it's such a great game that the only way to achieve a similar high after being banned is hijacking a schoolbus and forcing teenagers to kill each other.
Here's a fun (nonlethal) game we can play together, reader dear: I'm going to describe Gods Of Combat as best I can, then you tell me how you think it works.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As a staunch Nintendo head in the early console days, I would say my affection for PS1-era games is... present, but not particularly palpable. For me, the PlayStation One was mostly a machine to play Final Fantasies VII through IX on, and not much else (it was a very belated and cheap second-hand purchase, I should note, and games were still sufficiently expensive back then that maintaining two healthy game libraries for both the family N64 and my new Squall box was nigh on impossible). Nevertheless, I've been increasingly fascinated by the revival of PS1-era games in recent years, and it's been interesting to see which modern games have been "demade" in this style - see Bloodborne PSX - and which ones have made it their own from the off - see Signalis, Heartworm, and many others. 
Crow Country is the latest game I've seen to take up the PSX mantle, and it combines the chunkiness of Final Fantasy VII-style character models with the grimy survival horror of something like Resident Evil to brilliant effect. Made by SFB Games, the same devs wot made the also excellent Tangle Tower, it's currently got a very good demo up on Steam at the moment, and it's got me thinking: what do you like most about PS1-era games on PC, and which ones are your all-time favs?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you've seen Netflix's Arcane League of Legends animated series, there's a high probability you really like it – the show's great, even for non-League of Legends fans. It tells the heartwrenching story of sisters Vi and Jinx and their struggle to come to terms with each other in the high-tech (and magical) utopian city of Piltover and its seedy underbelly known as Zaun. The first season hit the subscription streaming service in November of 2021and now we know that Arcane Season 2 hits Netflix this time next year. 
More specifically, Arcane Season 2 drops on Netflix in November of 2024. To coincide with the news, Netflix has released a short teaser featuring Jinx. Check it out below:

With roughly a year to go before Season 2, if you haven't yet watched Arcane, which features voice actors like Hailee Steinfeld, Yuri Lowenthal, Ella Purnell, and more, you've got plenty of time to do so – and it's well worth your time!
In the meantime, check out the League of Legends Jinx champion skin that was added to Fortnite to celebrate Arcane, and then read Game Informer's review of Ruined King: A League of Legends story. Read about Convergence: A League of Legends Story after that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[World of Warcraft's expansion pack The War Within, out next year, comes in several flavours. There's the standard version of the pack, which includes access to previous expansions, currency for cosmetics and a level 70 character boost. The Heroic edition gives you all that plus a mount, a pet and extra in-game cash. And then there's the most expensive Epic edition, which includes a pet, two toys, 30 days of game time... and three days of early beta access to the game, yours for $89.99 in the states. 


Naturally, World of Warcrafters are rather concerned about the last bit. It's the first time Blizzard's long-running MMO has taken the paid early access approach, recently adopted by Starfield and Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 - there have been early access betas in the past, but they've been doled out by lottery. Blizzard's game director Ion Hazzikostas has now moved to reassure the grousers and gripers, promising that The War Within's Epic edition won't give minted early worms the edge over those poor peasants who scoop up the less pricey versions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Valve has unveiled its first upgraded iteration of the Steam Deck. Dubbed simply the Steam Deck OLED, the new handheld features several technical and form factor improvements, and it goes on sale next week.
As the name implies, the device boasts an HDR OLED screen to produce more vibrant colors. It also boasts a larger battery for an increased charge – 30-50% more battery life depending on the game, with Valve pointing out that the OLED screen consumes less power.
The device also includes an updated and more efficient AMD APU and Wi-Fi 6E, resulting in downloads up to three times faster for increased bandwidth and lower latency. Steam Deck OLED also runs cooler thanks to its bigger fan and improved thermals. Overall, the device is 5% lighter than the original model.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To quickly recap my Steam Deck OLED review, Valve’s refreshed handheld is brilliant, serving up major improvements to screen quality and battery life while making loads of little quality-of-life tweaks. Its reveal was a surprise, mind – haven’t Valve repeatedly said that there wouldn’t be another new Steam Deck for ages?


Not quite. That warning was always qualified in that a more powerful Deck was still a ways off, and the Steam Deck OLED’s performance improvements are both tiny and a likely incidental result of its efficiency savings. This very point was repeated to me in an interview with Valve designer Jay Shaw and software engineer Jeremy Selan, which also covered the Steam Deck family’s future, its current struggles with intensive big-budget games, and why they want "more, more, more" rivals like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go.

I was told as much on the Steam Deck’s first anniversary earlier this year, and according to Valve designer Jay Shaw and software engineer Jeremy Selan, that stance won't change once the Steam Deck OLED releases on November 16th. In an RPS interview, the full version of which is coming soon, the two developers explained why the real next generation of Steam Deck will take a few years – and why they decided against making the Steam Deck OLED’s new processor more powerful as well.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I didn’t know the Steam Deck OLED existed until last week, and yet it’s essentially something I’ve wanted for nearly two years. As great a handheld gaming PC as the original Steam Deck is, its slightly bland IPS display and short battery life are some definite weak points – points to which newer, shinier rivals, such as the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go, have been happy to apply pressure.
Valve are keen to stress that this OLED-equipped model represents an update, not a whole generational switcheroo. Yet there’s much, much more behind that screen that just some different diodes. This is a lighter, brighter, longer-lasting, sometimes even faster-running take on the SteamOS handheld, and one that sneaks in some surprise upgrades as often as it addresses issues with the original Steam Deck. I love it.

It’s a "definitive" refresh of the existing Steam Deck handheld PC that swaps the underwhelming IPS display for a brighter, more vibrant OLED panel, while making numerous battery life improvements – up to and including a new, more efficient AMD APU – that promise significantly more time away from the mains. It’s not far off either: the Steam Deck OLED’s release date is November 16th, just one week away.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For Vladimir Makarov, the babyfaced villain of Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, trust and morale are irrelevant concepts. As he makes clear to his army of Russian ultranationalists, he is interested only in their quiet, unwavering loyalty. Evidently, Activision expects much the same from its army of COD fans. This latest Modern Warfare campaign follows disconcertedly close on the heels of 2022’s entry because, as per Bloomberg, it began life as a mere expansion. Rather than allow a fallow year, Activision has upgraded that expansion’s status to a premium release, and charged $69.99 for pre-orders - granting early access to the single-player campaign as an enticement.


Instead of Modern Warfare’s usual lead studio, Infinity Ward, development duties have fallen to Sledgehammer, the outfit most recently responsible for 2021’s unloved Vanguard. And in an industry where AAA FPS games now regularly take half a decade to make, this campaign has reportedly come together in less than two years. Reader: it shows.

Erm.


Let's start again. As you may know, Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 - not to be confused with Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 - is out from today, 9th November. Pre-ordering players and a few lucky journos (whom we absolutely don't fear and resent for receiving copies early) have been able to play the campaign since 1st November, and the reactions and reviews thus far haven't been great.

Originally slated to release in 2021, the project has quietly remained in limbo for years, but developer Thekla Inc. has revealed that it’s finally arriving on April 30. 
Braid was first released for Xbox 360's Live Arcade on August 6, 2008, and stars Tim, a boy searching for a princess captured by a monster. The 2D platformer centers on time manipulation mechanics that players utilize to solve puzzles and locate/assemble jigsaw pieces. The strong mechanics combined with its contemplative writing made Braid a critical hit, with many hailing it as a masterpiece.

A faked death finally saw him freed from the shackles of the yakuza with one big catch: he couldn't ever see his family again. Since then, we've had the plucky Ichiban take on the mantle of Tojo Clan nastiness in Yakuza: Like A Dragon (7), with its sequel Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth (8) set to wash up on Hawaii's shores next year. What do we know about Infinite Wealth? Kiryu is set to return as a protagonist alongside Ichiban, with an all-new haircut. And more importantly, what has Like A Dragon Gaiden got to do with any of this? Well, it's a shorter stop-gap between the events of Yakuza 6 and Yakuza 8 that fills us in on what Kiryu's been up to this whole time.
But aside from moreish minigames and a fantastic Agent persona with web-slinging abilities, Kiryu's epilogue is a far cry from Yakuza's best stories. By no means is it bad, it just isn't the best introduction to the series for newcomers, and even longtime fans will struggle balancing his resurrection with its heavy feelings of repetition.

I want someone who really, really loves and hates things, and gives you reasons why.”
It’s a trait which Giovannetti has in common with his Megacrit co-founder, Casey Yano, and has possessed ever since he was a kid growing up in Woodinville, 30 minutes outside Seattle. It’s matched by a competitiveness that first emerged in Warhammer 40,000 tournaments as a teen. Before he was old enough to drive, Giovannetti would ride his bike to the local game store and play until the early hours of the morning.

A week later, in a quarterly financial results briefing, Sony CFO Hiroki Totoki revealed that PlayStation planned to launch more than 10 live service games by March 2026, with Bungie helping the company in the space. In an earnings call held today, Totoki stated that of its 12 live service games, it will only release six by Fiscal Year 2025, which ends March 2026, as reported by VideoGamesChronicle. 
Earlier this year, Bloomberg reported that Bungie was evaluating some of PlayStation's in-development offerings, including Naughty Dog's Last of Us multiplayer project, which is reportedly on ice. It seems that evaluation has led to Sony retooling its approach as the company has delayed at least six liv…]]></summary>

For context, Marvel's Spider-Man 2 outsold Super Mario Bros. Wonder, which is the fastest-selling Super Mario game after selling through 4.3 million copies in two weeks. Marvel's Spider-Man 2 was named the fastest-selling PlayStation Studios game just three days after its release, too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[GTA 6 publisher Take-Two Interactive’s CEO Strauss Zelnick has been on the blower to the company’s investors about the idea of making games using the latest artificial intelligence content generation tools. Echoing his relatively guarded enthusiasm for NFTs a couple of years ago, he’s sort of mixed on them, regarding AI tools less as transformative technologies than simply the latest step towards the eternal industry objective of More, Faster And Better For Less.
Zelnick thinks automated learning and generation tools will make development more “efficient” and games, overall “better”, but in terms of Take-Two’s own bottom line, any gains will likely be offset by the fact that other big companies have access to the same tools, and by the fact that Take-Two will take advantage of said efficiencies by setting more ambitious goals. As such, he doesn’t think using generative AI will lead to lower prices for big commercial games. If you’re a developer that can’t afford to buy or license generative “AI” tools, Zelnick added, you can expect competition to become “more intense” in the coming years. Good stuff.

If you purchase a new Gundam model kit at your local store today, it originated in this facility in Shizuoka, Japan. The factory contains 35 plastic color-molding machines – 25 electric and 10 hydraulic – all helping produce millions of models yearly.
Bandai Spirits employee Miyuki Nakagiri, the subject matter expert on how exactly the factory operates, escorts us through the building. Our translator during this tour is Atsuo Yoshimura, a video game production manager who’s worked at Bandai Namco for the last 17 years. Notably, Yoshimura worked on last year’s Elden Ring – Game Informer’s 2022 Game of the Year, and most recently, Armored Core VI Fires of Rubicon. Additionally, Yoshimura was instrumental in helping to coordinate Game Informer’s recent Armored Core VI cover story trip.

This chip offers solid gaming performance in modern AAA games plus PCIe 5.0 and DDR5 support (with the correct motherboard) all while costing significantly less than competing CPUs like the later 13600KF ($285) or AMD's Ryzen 5 7600 ($229) which offer only marginally better performance at 1080p and are basically the same speed at 1440p or 4K. 
For reference, I saw the 12600K deliver a minimum of 85% of the performance of the later 13600K (and by extension the nearly identical 14600K), while costing 54% of the price with this deal - surely that makes the 12600K the obvious choice?

One of my favourites is Dell's Alienware AW3423DWF, a 34-inch ultrawide that offers a fairly standard 3440x1440 165Hz spec - but its QD-OLED panel makes for a night-and-day difference against your standard VA and IPS panel alternatives, with perfect contrast, near-instant pixel response times, gorgeous colour reproduction and stunning HDR. 
It normally retails for around £929, but today it's down to £739 when you use the code GROUPON8 at Dell UK. That's about as cheap as we've ever seen it, and well worth it for anyone that wants a monitor primarily for gaming rather than content creation or mixed purposes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft has laid off more than 100 staff, continuing what feels like an unending wave of layoffs across the video games industry. The latest job losses spanning visual effects and IT departments come less than six months after the Assassin’s Creed and Rainbow Six publisher made dozens of custom service staff redundant.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When first I played GTA Online back in the Xbox 360 days it felt like an afterthought, a chance to play some random good-for-nothing in GTA 5's sizzling alt-Los Angeles, securely cloistered away from the events of the all-important singleplayer story. Having built yourself a no-name crim, you galloped around cranking out cash and XP by means of glorified sidequests handed down by headliners such as Lamar. Skip forward to 2023, and as Alice0 observed when we discussed Rockstar's GTA 6 announcements this morning, GTA Online is effectively an MMO with ten years of updates, expansions and community projects under its belt. The no-name crim has become the star attraction.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hallowe’en may be over (just), but for this month’s Reality Frights, I’ve got a wonderfully seasonal game for you. It’s the brand-new remake of the grand old mystery puzzler The 7th Guest, a game which Bill Gates notably referred to as “The new standard of interactive entertainment.” In fairness to ol’ William, he said this seven months before Doom blew out the new standard’s insides with a 12-gauge shotgun, shunting PC gamers’ tastes away from kitsch adventure games and toward grisly murder-fests. But The 7th Guest is nonetheless fondly remembered for its spooky atmosphere, alongside its blend of pre-rendered backgrounds and live action cutscenes you could call ‘pioneering’ had it not proved such an evolutionary dead end.
Today, the original 7th Guest looks more dated than Henry VIII, which is probably why this remake replaces everything but the very skeleton of the 1993 original. The game still takes place in a creepy mansion belonging to a murderous toymaker, and still involves six eccentric guests to the house searching for a missing boy named Tad. But it’s otherwise been completely rebuilt, with whole new puzzles and whole new mechanics, all designed to be experienced in first-person VR.

Each tribe calls one of the Western Frontier’s three biomes – Kinglor Forest, Upper Plains, and Clouded Forest, respectively – home. Ingratiating yourself with each one by learning their ways is an important step in your journey to reclaim your Na’vi culture, as well as garnering enough support to push back against the exploitative mining of the villainous RDA.
For a heads-up on what to expect as you try to warm up to each clan, here’s a breakdown of the culture and personality.

I've long admired their intricate dances of orbs and criss-crossing laser fire, but I have long resigned myself to merely being a spectator of such games, rather than an active ship pilot. Cobalt Core, however, is exactly my kind of speed. It's not a bullet hell shooter, but it is about two spaceships facing off against each other in an eyes-locked duel of incoming cannon fire, and sliding side to side to avoid getting exploded as you attempt to unravel the mysterious timeloop your crew of weird space animals appear to be stuck in. Just, you know, in a neat, turn-based fashion, where your opponent's attacks are flagged up in advance, and you must use your randomised deck of cards to weave and dodge your way to victory. It's very moreish, and very Into The Breach. I love it.

According to a new financial briefing from the company, it plans to support the Switch seemingly long after the release of rumored new-gen hardware expected to launch next year. 
It's been a big week for Nintendo, with the company revealing that Super Mario Bros. Wonder is the fastest-selling Super Mario game in the series and that a live-action Legend of Zelda movie is on the way. We also learned yesterday the Switch has surpassed 132 million units sold on the heels of great results for The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and Pikmin 4. Now, Nintendo has pulled back the curtains a bit on its approach to the Switch platform moving forward.

The first Act of the new Steam demo sees you staggering onto the beach below some kind of tropical resort. You wander up past the pools to the cavernous lobby and are immediately set upon by haggard guests, who appear to think you're a member of staff. So you become a member of staff, fetching margaritas, tracking down the check-in ledger and running downstairs to adjust the boiler settings. You earn XP from quests towards employee ranks that unlock useful items at vending machines. And you try to work out what you're doing here, and why everybody's so terrified of the sun. I haven't deciphered the mystery yet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rockstar Games will release the first trailer for its highly anticipated sequel to 2013's Grand Theft Auto V, which became the most profitable entertainment product of all time in 2018, next month. As of August, Grand Theft Auto V has sold more than 185 million copies since its release 10 years ago. 
Official news of this trailer from the Rockstar Twitter account comes less than a day after a Bloomberg report that states Rockstar will reveal the sequel, presumably titled Grand Theft Auto VI or Grand Theft Auto 6, this week with a trailer for it arriving sometime next month; Since the release of this report yesterday, Rockstar has confirmed a trailer for the next Grand Theft Auto will, in fact, be released in December. 
We are very excited to let you know that in early December, we will release the first trailer for the next Grand Theft Auto. We look forward to many more years of sharing these experiences with all of you.
November 8, 2023
Game Informer has reached out to Rockstar's parent company Take-Two Interactive to ask about this report and reveal and will update the story if more information is learned. 
The journey to the reveal of the next Grand Theft Auto has not happened quietly. In September of last year, unprecedented leaks gave fans a potential look at the sequel in over 90 videos showcasing secret in-development footage of the open-world crime sequel.  We also learned last year that the game reportedly stars a female protagonist. Bloomberg says this Grand Theft Auto V sequel is set in a fictional version of Miami and features the aforementioned female protagonist as well as a male protagonist. 


While waiting to learn more about Rockstar's next game, read Game Informer's Grand Theft Auto V review and then read our thoughts on Red Dead Redemption II. After that, read Game Informer's ranking of every single Rockstar game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Revenant Hill, the next game by the makers of Night in the Woods, has been canceled. The reason is that the game's narrative designer and artist Scott Benson is battling a severe illness that has forced him to step away from the project.
Benson reveals on his personal X account that he’s been suffering severe heart failure over the past 12 months, which has greatly limited his ability to work. You can read his post below. 
So. Over the past 12 months or so I got very sick and it didn't go away. Eventually I was diagnosed with severe heart failure, most likely from a virus. It will continue to greatly limit me for the foreseeable future and as such I've had to stop working in the manner I once did.

Today HyperX joins that list of big-name bargains with their Alloy Origins full-size mechanical keyboard dropping to just $32 when bought from GameStop in the US, versus its original price of $109.99. That's a great bargain for a keyboard with red (soft linear) mechanical switches, optional RGB lighting and a high-quality metal chassis.

        <updated>2023-11-07T18:57:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, Ubisoft is the latest developer to join 2023's wave of layoffs. According to IGN, the company laid off a total of 124 employees. 98 of them were based in Canada, which IGN calculates as roughly 2% of the company's Canadian workforce. The cuts included administrative and IT workers, some of whom were employed at the Hybride VFX studio, a company that has worked on shows like Ahsoka and The Mandalorian.


"These are not decisions taken lightly and we are providing comprehensive support for our colleagues who will be leaving Ubisoft during this transition," the company told both IGN and Kotaku. "We also want to share our utmost gratitude and respect for their many contributions to the company. This restructuring does not affect our production teams." Another quote obtained by Kotaku claims that the layoffs are to allow Ubisoft to "to optimize its resources to be more sustainable in the long term."
This news comes after a year of several big Ubisoft releases, including Assassin's Creed Mirage, The Crew: Motorfest, and Just Dance 2024, but that's in spite of the fact that they canceled several games this year and delayed Skull and Bones... again. Unrest at the company has been ongoing as well: back in September, IGN reported widespread frustration after employees were suddenly called to return to in-person working conditions.
Ubisoft now joins Bungie, Media Molecule, Telltale Games, Team17, Epic Games, Naughty Dog, Microsoft, and more on the unfortunately long list of companies that have laid people off in the past year.

Resident Evil Village hit the App Store just last week, and today, Capcom has let us know when Resident Evil 4 Remake is coming to the platform: December 20. You can see some screenshots from the Apple port below. 

The game won't be available to all iPhone owners, however. Resident Evil 4 Remake will only be available on the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max, meaning you'll have to grab the newest product in order to play this game on the go. That said, it will also be available on iPads and Macs with the M1 chip or later. If you're a diehard Apple fan and have multiple RE4 Remake compatible products, you'll be happy to know that the game also supports cross-progression between Apple devices, so you can start a save file on your Mac at home and pick it up on your phone when you're on the go.
The game is available for pre-order on the App Store now, but players will be able to start the game for free before committing to a full purchase. Its recently released DLC, Separate Ways, will launch alongside it as well. While we haven't been able to go hands-on with this version of the game quite yet, we like Resident Evil 4 Remake quite a lot: you can read our review for it right here.]]></summary>

When the original Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl came out in 2021, it was a relatively bare-bones experience, but those bones were solid. Despite lacking many single-player modes, items, and even character voices, the core gameplay was good enough to keep the game afloat until it received refinements via online updates over the next two years. Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2, however, comes packaged with all those improvements and more. Developer Fair Play Labs has learned its lessons, and while the game isn't without its faults, it's a more-than-worthy follow-up.

After a recent patch a few weeks ago that made the game easier and added in some Halloween festivity, developer Hexworks and publisher CI Games have released its schedule of content for the game and it includes new questlines, two new events, more armor and weapons, and more. 
The roadmap also includes a "regular weekly cadence of updates focusing on bringing further stability, performance optimization, and balancing improvements to the game, including its online crossplay experience." 


Stopping short of specifics, Hexworks says before the year's end, it will add multiple new quest lines to Lords of the Fallen, with the opportunity to unlock some unique armor sets and weapons. The studio says some of this armor and weaponry has been co-created with the community during recent collaborative livestreams. Plus, the studio says "players can look forward to 12 new spells, new finisher attacks, and a whole host of community-requested features, including the recently revealed New Game Plus (NG+) modifier system – a first for the genre, and highly anticipated by the Lords of the Fallen community." 
"At Hexworks, we're incredibly proud of the open relationship we're fostering with our community," studio head Saül Gascon writes in a press release. "We are actively listening to their constructive feedback and working diligently to deliver what we believe, collectively, will elevate Lords of the Fallen further. Every addition to the game is a labor of love, as we strive to push both it and the genre's boundaries."

Since its October 27 release, Remedy has released three updates, including its biggest yet last week, for the game so far.

Alan Wake 2 Update 1.0.9 
PlayStation 5: Update 1.00.09
Xbox Series X/S: Update 1.0.0.9
PC: Update 1.0.9
Xbox Series – A workaround fix for the issue where the audio cut out intermittently in the Prologue. We are expecting a full fix for this issue in an upcoming update.
Room 665 – Fixed an issue (again) with the Echo scene not aligning and unlocking correctly (this was fixed in the previous update, but Echo hell still persisted)  
Local Girl – Fixed an issue with a mouse (with a big presence) blocking progress.
And that's everything in the latest Alan Wake 2 update. Catch up on everything the Alan Wake 2 update from last week fixed with the game here. 
For more, read Game Informer's Alan Wake 2 review and then check out this update where Remedy discusses its development progress on Control 2 and its Max Payne remakes.

It did so thanks to great software sales for new first-party games released this year like The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and Pikmin 4. 
This news comes from Nintendo's Fiscal Year 2024 second quarter financial results, which ended September 30. In it, we learn the Switch has officially reached 132.46 million units sold, getting it closer to the company's best-selling hardware, the Nintendo DS at 154.02 million units sold. The only other console above the DS overall is the PlayStation 2 at roughly 158 million units sold.

While a bummer for those who make frequent use of this feature, which offers a simple method of posting gameplay content to the platform, there are a couple of more involved alternatives depending on your platform. If you’re a PS5 user, you can still use the PlayStation mobile app to upload gameplay captures to then post on X. You can read how to do that here. PS4 users have to rely on ShareFactory and do a bit more work, and you can read those steps here.
Microsoft made the same move in April by disabling sharing to X directly from the console and instructing players to instead use the Xbox app on mobile (with some speculating the decision was made to avoid paying the platform's then-new monthly application programming interface (API) fee). This now means that the Switch will become the sole console that supports direct media sharing to X. 
What do you think about the decision to end X integration? Did you use this feature regularly? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

Late last week, Naver suggested that after obtaining site operators' personal details from Cloudflare, around 150 sites with 2.5 billion annual visits subsequently shut down. While that's a huge claim, just one of those sites accounted for three quarters of a billion visits.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are very pleased to announce today the start of the testing period of two single-game engines: Kingdom: The Far Reaches and Escape From Hell!
Kingdom, was developed and released by Interplay in 1995. Only the DOS version of the game (available on gog.com) is supported. It's a cartoon FMV game, with an inventory, in which you have to guide Lathan Kandor through a medieval world, discovering the magic spells and the items required to defeat an evil wizard. 
Escape From Hell, was developed for Electronic Arts by the game veterans Richard Seaborne and Alan Murphy and was released in 1990. You play Alan in this keyboard-only Role Playing Game and visit Hell, looking for your girlfriend who was accidentally teleported there.
Both games use heavily hardcoded logic which is error prone and requires a lot of testing, so we need your feedback more than ever as they are both incompletely tested. There is sadly only one known demo for Kingdom. Support for the Windows and Mac versions of Kingdom may come later! Please contact us if you have some other demos of both games.
To play any of these games, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker and please take some screenshots along the way!

In dozens of local and international news reports, this 'official' figure is cited verbatim. We have zero faith in it, and we aren't alone. After a silent unreferenced edit, the police press release now reads €366,250, but the government's copy remains intact.
