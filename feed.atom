The release says, "This was not the plan," and attributes the mix-up to a difference in their holiday schedules. 


They go on to say that while those regions will have access to the Switch version of the game early, it will be a version with "known bugs and missing quality-of-life improvements." Nightdive also says that a patch for these issues already exists, but they can't deploy it at the early launch in these regions. Furthermore, because of the mix-up and the certification process, they expect that the patch won't be available for these regions until mid-December, whereas other regions and platforms will have it at…]]></summary>

Nintendo has been incredibly busy in recent months bolstering the Switch lineup with all sorts of new first-party offerings. Following on from WarioWare: Move It! just a few weeks ago, it's now preparing for the return of Super Mario RPG.
This classic Square game started out on the Super Nintendo in 1996 and this week returns in the form of a remake with updated visuals and sound, and even some tweaks to the gameplay. In our own hands on here at Nintendo Life, we thought it might just be the most faithful remake we've ever played.

Mashing up my favorite Spirited Away and Stardew Valley and featuring my favorite pastimes of taking baths and drinking tea, it had everything going for it. Heck, the protagonist is a writer who travels to the countryside to work on their latest book. I'm a writer. At least, I sometimes claim to be.


But after nearly 20 hours, I was a season and a half into the game. I’d befriended a handful of spirits and villagers. The bathhouse was coming along. But it was crawling. Forget relaxing; going back to Spirittea was beginning to just add to my misery. Something went wrong here.

I’ve been fighting a losing battle to try and get Extreme Paintbrawl working on a modern PC. That game has the reputation of being the absolute worst game ever built in Ken Silverman’s wonderful Build Engine. While the engine was home to games like Duke Nukem 3D, Shadow Warrior, and Blood, it also had a lot more questionable games. Last week, I covered 1998's Nam. This week, we’re looking at another game by the same developer, World War II G.I.. Maybe next week, we’ll look at William Shatner’s TekWar if I can get it working. Let’s hope not!

Call of Duty cycles through its lineup of villains on a yearly basis. Sometimes it's Nazis, other times it's Russian nationalists or zombies. But the most dangerous threat is one without a lust for brains or access to weapons of war; it's stagnation. And while many Call of Duty teams often switch up just enough variables to stave off monotony, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III fully submits to the annual churn.


Speeding ahead also impedes the storytelling since it barrels through beats at …]]></summary>

Logitech's K400 Plus is a popular model in this niche category, and normally retails for an affordable $28. Today though, it's down to $19 on Amazon, a sweet 32% discount that makes it near impulse buy territory for anyone that has a PC for which a regular mouse and keyboard setup isn't quite convenient.

Amazon itself confirmed these sources. It also sent a copy of an internal email to Aftermath from Amazon Games VP Christoph Hartmann stating, "We’ve listened to our customers and we know delivering free games every month is what they want most, so we are refining our Prime benefit to increase our focus there. With these changes in our business approach come changes to our resourcing, resulting in the elimination of just over 180 roles."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After months of character reveals, Tekken 8 has announced the final fighter of its launch roster: Reina. This brand-new character sports a lightning-quick moveset, earning her the nickname “Purple Lightning," and has mysterious ties to the Mishima clan.
Bandai Namco states that little is known about Reina's history besides she’s a student of the Mishima Polytechnical School. For some reason, she really wants to fight Jin (move over, Hwoarang), and based on her gameplay trailer, she seems more than capable of taking him on. Check Reina out in action below. 


With Reina’s addition, the 32-fighter roster is now complete. Here’s the full list of characters, with new fighters denoted and links to applicable articles/trailers:
Alisa Bosconovitch
Asuka Kazama
Azucena Milagros Ortiz Castillo (New)
Bryan Fury
Claudio Serafino
Devil Jin
Feng Wei
Hwoarang
Jack-8 (New)
Jin Kazma
Jun Kazama
Kazuya Mishima/Devil Kazuya
King
Kuma
Lars Alexandersson
Lee Chaolan
Leo Kliesen
Leroy Smith
Lili Rochefort
Ling Xiaoyu
Marshall Law
Nina Williams
Panda
Paul Phoenix
Raven
Reina (New)
Sergei Dragunov
Shaheen
Steve Fox
Victor Chevalier (New)
Yoshimitsu
Zafina
Additionally, the game's first Season of post-launch DLC will add four unannounced fighters. These characters will be released separately each season throughout 2024, with the first arriving sometime in the spring. 
Tekken 8 launches on January 26 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. Check our early hands-on impressions of the game here.]]></summary>

Make sure you pick up one of each leader if you intend to progress in Warcraft Rumble in any meaningful way. Or, you can stop playing, that's fine too.


Endgame is predicated on having one leader of each type


Up until sigil level 75 (sigils essentially serve as your account level/progression marker), the easiest way to progress with the game is to clear every new stage as it is unlocked. Once you get to level 75 (a process we go over extensively in this late game guide), things slow to a crawl, new levels stop opening up, and things get murkier.


From here on out, you'll need to clear each old stage on heroic mode (read: levels are harder with ne…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dark crystals.
The hallowed Metroidvania has gone from an original, curiously enticing one-off concept, to a highly consumable once-monthly product fit for devouring at speed. If you’re now, as we are, extremely seasoned in the format pioneered by Symphony of the Night in 1997, you’ll likely rip through 9 Years of Shadows like a '46 Ford through a DeLorean. Ergo, like tinfoil.
Developed by Mexican indie outfit Halberd Studios, it would, in our opinion, have made better literary sense to be dubbed ‘9 Years of Shadow’ - but then we're hopeless grammar Nazis because, it’s like, our job 'n' stuff. The story goes that a realm has been afflicted by a nine-year plague and, with it, the colour sapped from the land. Europa, the female protagonist, has watched friend and family pass to a sinister sickness while she somehow stands immune. She then decides to grab a weapon, don some armour, and head into an evil castle to destroy the core, as it were.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Amazon is laying off 180 jobs in its games division, hopping on the tragically overcrowded bandwagon of layoffs in the game industry this year. The news comes via Aftermath, which reports that the layoffs are focused in two areas – the Crown Twitch channel, which will reportedly be eliminated altogether, and the game growth teams. Employees were notified of the changes through an email from Christoph Hartman, VP of Amazon Games. This is the second wave of layoffs this division of the company has faced this year.
An excerpt of the announcement email can be read below:
There have been so many layoffs in the gaming industry this year that it's getting hard to keep track of. Last week, we learned Free Radical Design is on the verge of closing down and that Ubisoft laid off more than 100 employees. The week before that, roughly 100 employees were laid off at Destiny 2 developer Bungie. 
In January, Microsoft laid off 10,000 employees amidst its ongoing $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard, which it completed last month. 
In August, Striking Distance Studios, the team behind last year's The Callisto Protocol, laid off more than 30 employees, and that same month, Mass Effect and Dragon Age developer BioWare laid off 50 employees, including long-time studio veterans. The following month, in September, Immortals of Aveum developer Ascendant Studios laid off roughly 45% of its staff. 
Just last month, The Last of Us developer Naughty Dog laid off at least 25 employees, and Telltale Games underwent layoffs as well, although an actual number of laid-off employees has not yet been revealed. And in late October, Dreams developer Media Molecule laid off 20 employees.
The hearts of Game Informer's staff are with the people laid off from Amazon Games, along with everyone else who has lost a job this year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The console wars continue to rage on, as always. Nothing gets the gaming market fired up quite like being at loggerheads with competitors. There's never usually a clear winner, but for the UK, the PS5 seems to be outshining the rest.


According to Gamesindustry.biz, a report from GfK – a data and market intelligence analyst – reveals Sony's current-gen system has been doing remarkably well in the UK. Between November 2022 and October 2023, the PS5 had a 43% market share. However, over the past six months, this has increased to 51%, giving a majority slice.


GfK boss Dorian Bloch says this rise could be down to "unrestricted sales on the standard PS5 hardware model, aggressive price promotions in July and August, and the recent EA Sports FC 24 bundle."


The upcoming Slim model as well, perhaps?


Compare that to platform rivals like Xbox, in which figures indicate a three percent drop in the same time frame. This means the Microsoft console went from a 26% market share to just 23%. Similarly, the Switch experienced a much bigger drop, which is down to 34% from 25%.


Whether these trends will change is up for debate. The holiday period is almost upon us, with Black Friday deals inbound. Both the digital and disc drive versions of the PS5 Slim are available now at some US retailers, but folks in the UK are still waiting for the new model to drop. 


Bloch goes on to say that the fourth quarter of the year (basically Christmas) accounts for up to 55% of hardware unit sales. In which case, "there is still a lot to play for at the time of writing."

While the throwback 3D platforming adventure looked great in its own right, what caught a lot of people's attention was the team behind it. Evening Star's creative director and lead engine architect is Christian Whitehead, one of the lead developers behind 2017's Sonic Mania. Whitehead isn't alone, though, as various other Evening Star developers also worked on Sonic Mania. While we've still got some time before the game's release – it's due out sometime in 2024 – Game Informer has a special sneak peek at its music and can exclusively reveal three tracks from the game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some indie news to end the year is on the way. Nintendo has announced a new Indie World Showcase will air tomorrow, November 14.


The Indie World Showcase is set to spotlight around 20 minutes of information on both new and known games coming to the Nintendo Switch. It will air at 9 a.m. PT / noon ET on Nintendo's channels. You can follow it here as well.




As a reminder, this is an indie showcase, not a Nintendo Direct. So any hopes you might have for a new Switch or other reveal, don't expect that sort of thing here. Instead, Nintendo's indie showcases highlight third-party games, usually from smaller developers.


What to expect at the Indie World Showcase


I mean, it's an Indie World Showcase. The Silksong hope is tangible in the air. It's there, like it is every time we have one of these.


Otherwise, there are a few indies waiting in the wings. Animal Well, Rift of the Necrodancer, and Little Kitty, Big City are all games that have shown up at previous showcases that could reappear here.


But really, it's the surprises I always like the most in the independently focused showcases. Games that I hadn't heard of suddenly rocketing onto my radar. And of course, surprise drops. Who doesn't enjoy a good "it's out later today"?


So we'll see what Nintendo has in store for this end-of-the-year indie news lineup, in an already stacked year for games. Maybe there's something waiting to make GOTY even tougher than it already was.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alan Wake and Control developers Remedy Entertainment have announced that their untitled co-op shooter, the artist formerly known as project Vanguard, will no longer be a free-to-play game - largely, it seems, because the free-to-play business is looking a bit dicey. The game has been given a new codename to celebrate: Kestrel. It's still a co-op multiplayer affair, however.


The reboot follows an evaluation period during which Remedy and publisher Tencent discussed a proof-of-concept version of the game, as we reported last month. They've now kicked it back to the concept phase "due to uncertainties in creating a successful game [in] the rapidly changing free-to-play market and associated risks". A few members of the old Vanguard development team have moved to other Remedy projects, while the core leadership and certain select developers carry on with Kestrel.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After Alan Wake 2, all eyes are on Remedy, and the studio has plenty in store. It announced today that its previously announced project with Tencent will be rebooted with a few significant changes. 


In 2021, it was announced that Remedy and Tencent are partnering up to make a free-to-play co-op title. Codenamed Vanguard, the game is being developed with the Unreal Engine instead of Remedy's in-house Northlight engine, and there are plans to release it on PC and consoles. 


With the reboot, the project has been renamed Kestrel. The change has been motivated by fears surrounding the rapidly changing free-to-play market. Though huge changes are being made, some elements remain, including the strong focus on multiplayer elements.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back at the tail-end of 2021, Bethesda released the Anniversary Edition of Skyrim. Along with new content and the official DLC, the game also came with a new fishing mode. Pleasant though it was, one person felt it needed a bit of tweaking.


Veteran Skyrim modder JaySerpa is back again with another improvement to TES5. This time, they've decided to overhaul the fishing aspect of the game. Their latest mod tackles (funny joke!) the overall mechanics of this chill mini-game.




In particular, they've added a third-person mode, made it so you can move the camera around in first-person, and added a "bait requirement" as an optional addition.


Not all citizens approve, though


It wouldn't be a JaySerpa mod without the addition of some new dialogue. In this instance, we get to hear what Skyrim NPCs think about us stopping for a little bit of fishing betwixt questing. Around 200 lines have been added in, allowing for a more immersive experience as followers react to your newfound hobby.


The above video gives us an idea of what kind of dialogue can be spoken. This could be someone simply saying they'll stand guard while you fish. Others simply comment on how much they enjoy the sport. Then there are those who suggest an air of ennui or even boredom.


In any case, it's just one more way to kick the immersion of Skyrim up another notch. The modder says this should be compatible with other fishing quality-of-life mods, but they also warn the animations in third-person are "not perfect." But what is in this wild world?

November 13, 2023
As with every Indie World Showcase, the question must be asked: is this the time where we finally see Hollow Knight: Silksong, the Hollow Knight sequel from developer Team Cherry that began life as a DLC to the original game? It probably won't be but it's always fun to get your hopes up a little bit so that they may be gently crushed. 
Tomorrow's Indie World Showcase for Nintendo Switch begins at Noon ET. 
In the meantime, read Game Informer's Hollow Knight review and then check out everything announced during the last Indie World Showcase, which was held in April, for a glance at what to potentially expect with tomorrow's.

This leap forward, however, is really more of a dodge, as that's one of the most notable new features making their way into the game. As per the developer Crate Entertainment's recent announcement, Grim Dawn is due to receive a dedicated evade ability (with invincibility frames, to boot), hugely improved level and difficulty scaling, an overhaul of all loot tables, and the streamlining of how it handles its health and mana motions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Having just passed its 12th birthday, Skyrim continues to take up real estate in the AAA gaming sphere. As one of the most successful RPGs in recent memory, Bethesda's epic Elder Scrolls game is still quite pretty, but has evidently aged over the past decade or so.


That's where artist and YouTuber Leo Torres coming into the picture. As spotted by DSO Gaming, Torres has recently uploaded a new video showing what Skyrim would look like were it built today in Unreal Engine 5.




More specifically, we get to see some incredible shots of the bitterly cold northerly city Winterhold. It looks, for want of a better phrase, pretty spectacular, which is not something many people are willing to say about TES5 these days.


What could have been


In this era of remakes, it's fun to imagine what an aging game like Skyrim would look like in something such as Unreal. Torres' render gives us a taste of how things could have been in a different universe. Obviously, this is just a video render demonstrating Winterghold at a "more realistic and lore-accurate scale." It's not a remake currently in development, official or otherwise.


It also gives us an idea of just how far gaming visuals have come over the years. That's not to say Skyrim is ugly (far from it), merely that many of us take it for granted just how advanced graphics become given enough time.


As for The Elder Scrolls itself, we're currently on day seventy-squillion (citation needed) and no word on the sixth entry yet. There's a good chance Skyrim's popularity may drop off suddenly once TES6 comes out, but we'll probably all be a lot older and wiser by then.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Studio Ghibli's Spirited Away is a film about a spoilt young girl who is obliged to work at a bathhouse for supernatural creatures, after her parents are turned into pigs by a wicked witch. Spirittea from Edmonton, Canada-based Cheesemaker Games is Spirited Away in the guise of a Stardew Valley-style management sim. Released today, it casts you as a wholesome young entrepreneur who has just arrived in a town full of rogue supernatural creatures. To free the town from its spectral infestation, you must renovate an old mountain bathhouse and treat each phantom to a jolly good scrub. You might also need to deal with some Unfinished Business, such as tracking down a lost possession. At least there's no witch to worry about. That I know of, anyway.


I have fond memories of Spirited Away - it was the film that re-introduced me to anime as an undergraduate, following the traditional early-career middlebrow otaku phase of obsessing over Akira, Cowboy Bebop and Ghost in the Shell while turning my nose up at stuff like Naruto, because it's "just for kids". I was on the brink of pitching a Spirittea review, but then our reviews editor Ed Thorn emerged howling and gibbering from the floorboards and asked me to review a 100-hour RPG instead (won't spoil), so I'll have to settle for trying the demo.

If you play enough video games, you can see when developers are playing it safe, but that isn’t the case for Outerloop’s Thirsty Suitors. If anything, it is trying to do too much, its ambition reaching to heights that its budget simply can’t deliver, but we found ourselves not minding. So much love went into this game that even its flaws are endearing.
We all know that one friend who makes every relationship a bit messy. In the small town of Timber Hills, that person is Jala. She’s a first-rate skateboarder and heartbreaker, returning to her hometown after ruining yet another relationship. Waiting for her are her parents, her incredibly strong Auntie, and a host of scorned lovers looking to even the score. Jala isn’t returning home on great terms, but untangling the mess she made when she left is what makes the characters of Thirsty Suitors shine so brightly.

I would like to propose an analogous theory for horror games and cute games whereby past a certain point of cuteness, the videogame in question teeters over dramatically into dread and nausea. We could call it the "horseshuwu effect".


As evidence of this, please witness the unholy magnificence of Saccharinity of Starfield, a Starfield mod from lucyprrrr and the Sakura Candy Society, which treats Starfield's items, spaceships, buildings, vegetation, planet models and, worst of all, people to a barbie-doll makeover reminiscent of a seriously overclocked shoujo anime.

Amidst the lively conversation, Patricia Summersett, who voices Zelda in Tears of the Kingdom, has stated that she would love to return to her role in the upcoming movie. 


In an interview with GamesRadar+, Summersett reveals just how attached she has grown to her role since she voiced in Breath of the Wild. Though she's voiced the princess in three games already, including Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity, she claims she "could always take more of it." Of course, this doesn't mean that her return has been confirmed in the upcoming movie, as the cast list has yet to be revealed.

The Legend of Zelda movie


Earlier this year, there were rumors that a The Legend of Zelda movie is in the works courtesy of Illumination. The rumors were proven false, though they did correctly predict that Nintendo is working on adapting its highly successful franchise. 


The movie is being directed by Maze Runner's Wes Ball, and it will be produced by Pikmin creator Shigeru Miyamoto and Avi Arad who is chairman of Arad Productions Inc. Somewhat surprisingly, the film is receiving financing from Sony Pictures Entertainment, though more than 50% will be financed by Nintendo. 


With no DLC planned for Tears of the Kingdom, the announced movie is something for fans to look forward to if they're searching for their next big dose of Zelda. No release date has been given yet.

Who knew..? When asked about the design of the male protagonist - commonly known as 'Ethan' - Unno stated "We wanted to make him more Japanese - or rather, make him look more like a ninja."

As such, I'm tickled gall-bladder-pink to hear that Blizzard consider the action-RPG series "a wonderful platform" for different types of game, now that they've made the leap to an open world format. 


For the most part, said experimentation will occur in the course of Diablo 4 expansions - the first of which, Diablo 2 throwback Vessel of Hatred, will launch in late 2024, adding a new class to the game described as "never before seen in the Diablo universe". But from the sounds of things, there's scope for the "franchise in general" to evolve too.

The latest physical UK charts are here and, as expected, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III has landed with a band, comfortably taking the number one position despite selling roughly 25% less than the previous entry in the franchise (thanks, Chris Dring).
This means that Super Mario Bros. Wonder is no longer holding onto the gold trophy this week and instead settling for bronze, falling below Call of Duty and EA Sports FC 24. It's not all doom and gloom though - far from it - as Nintendo is still well-represented in the top ten with Mario Wonder, Nintendo Switch Sports, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, and the Switch version of Minecraft.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There’s plenty to appreciate in Alan Wake 2 including the clever use of music and lyrics. One catchy song in particular has been popular enough to inspire a fan-made music video for it. Major spoilers are ahead if you haven't played Initiation 4: We Sing.  


In Initiation 4, Alan finds himself in a weird musical featuring Sam Lake, Mr Door, and the Old Gods of Asgard. The chapter mixes live action with animation, and it provides lyrics so that you can sing along while catching up on the plot thus far. An unofficial video has been made by blending different scenes from throughout the game. It’s done so brilliantly that you’d swear it was an official music video from Remedy.


Screenshot by Destructoid.


Music in Alan Wake 2


The song, called 'Herald of Darkness', is performed by the Finnish band Poets of the Fall who appear as the fictional band Old Gods of Asgard in the Alan Wake franchise. They play a pivotal role in Alan Wake 2 by helping Saga perform a summoning ritual near Cauldron Lake. The band's songs also contain lyrics that are relevant to the game. 




Alan Wake isn’t the only game where Remedy has gone crazy with music. In Control, the soundtrack helps to set the atmosphere, and the Ashtray Maze in particular offers an unforgettable blend of music and game to keep your adrenaline pumping.




'Herald of Darkness' is hitting major streaming sites, including Spotify and Apple Music, on November 15. On December 8, you’ll be able to pick up the Old Gods of Asgard Rebirth - Greatest Hits album. It contains songs from the band found in the Alan Wake series and Control.


We may still get to hear more from the band, as Remedy has DLC planned for Alan Wake 2. The first offering, Night Springs, is scheduled to launch in Spring 2024.

All versions except the Nintendo Switch "largely share the same visual qualities". In handheld mode, the Switch delivers a full 720p native output but some stages run at a 720p resolution. In docked, the resolution hits 720p, with reduced texture resolution and lower texture filtering.

So, how do you play Pokémon in Genshin? Certain characters, like Fischl, can summon creatures to fight for them. Fischl can summon a crow familiar named Oz, who stays on-field and deals damage. There are others, too, like Kokomi, who summons a jellyfish, and Xiangling, who summons a small bear named Guoba. Combine multiple summons like this, and you end up with a field full of Pokémon ready to do your bidding.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Zagreus has found his new home: Netflix. Revealed during Netflix Geeked Week, Supergiant Games' Hades is coming to Netflix's gaming service in 2024.




The 2020 roguelike is joining the ranks of Immortality, Spiritfarer, and Oxenfree as one of the available games in the service. Netflix Gaming is free for all Netflix subscribers, so owners of the streaming giant can play at no extra cost. The announcement also came with the news that Braid, Death's Door, and Katana Zero would be added in 2024.


It's in the Blood


Hades follows the son of the titular ruler of the underworld, Zagreus, as he tries to escape the Underworld. With the help of the gods of Olympus, you die, die, and die again as you battle through ever-changing maps. Upon its release on Switch and PC, the game was lauded for its character design and addicting roguelike gameplay.


Our own Jordan Devore rated the game a 9/10, citing Supergiant Games' strong storytelling and stellar RPG combat. Hades was nominated for multiple Game of the Year awards and even won Destructoid's own Overall Best Game of 2020. 


I played the heck out of Hades when it was on Game Pass. Seeing it made available for all Netflix subscribers is a joy. Now, more people can play this stellar game whenever and wherever they want. It's a trip to Hell I am down to go to.


The timing for Hades to come to Netflix is pretty coincidental, as Supergiant Games is expanding the universe next year with Hades II. The game, which made its way onto my RPGs to look out for, follows Zagreus' sister, Melinoë. Instead of her father, she'll face the Titan of Time alongside new faces. The game is set to go Early Access in Q2 of 2024 for PC. While it's set to release on consoles, no specifics were given.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The adventures of Lara Croft are looking quite promising. As part of Netflix Geeked Week, Legendary Entertainment released a behind-the-scenes look at the Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft series.


Powerhouse Animation Studios, known for its Castlevania series, is taking on the daring archaeologist with the help of Legendary Entertainment. Based on Crystal Dynamics' reboots/prequels, Netflix's Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft sets up the Lara seen in the 1996 original. The video, narrated by Character Design Supervisor Joy Lua, showcases the globe-trotting journeys we'll see her take, as well as some callbacks to different games.




Tomb Raider steps out of the shadows for Netflix


The video starts with some drawings and rough storyboard scenes, previewing some of the show's worldwide action. We see Lara snowboarding off a parachute and traversing buildings in Paris like an action hero. As Lara in the reboot trilogy usually stayed in one country, it's cool to see her out and about. 


Concepts for the places she'll go (yes, including tombs) are shown toward the end. She'll also sport some new gear, donning a dress in one shot and snow gear in another. Of course, she'll have her bow, pickaxe, and pistols alongside her. The team aims to provide many Easter eggs for longtime fans and bridge the gap between old and new. 


While the animated Netflix series picks up after Shadow of the Tomb Raider, reboot era Lara voice actress Camilla Luddington of Grey's Anatomy is not reprising her role, with Marvel the MCU's Agent Carter, Haley Atwell, picking up the dual pistols. Jonah, played by Earl Baylon, is back and given a small look via concept art. As a fan of Castlevania and Powerhouse, as well as the reboots, it seems like Lara is in good hands.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As a kid, I sometimes played odd games I found on the internet or watched playthroughs of them. Most of these were RPG Maker horror games because something about mixing cute art styles with terrifying imagery and plots resonated with a young me. 


The Coffin of Andy and Leyley is probably the first title to take me back to this oddly specific point in my life. Since playing the first two episodes, I can't get it out of my head. 


The game follows siblings Andrew and Ashley Graves as they hatch a plan to escape the apartment they're trapped in. Along the way, they develop a taste for human flesh, and it's quickly clear that both are monsters.

Soapbox features enable our individual writers and contributors to voice their opinions on hot topics and random stuff they've been chewing over. Today, Jim celebrates six months of Tears of the Kingdom by flying back into Link's latest...


The launch of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom was such a momentous occasion for me, so much so that the 12th May 2023 will forever be burned into the back of my mind. Over the summer, I kept playing it without putting it down, yet, as the weeks ticked by and the likes of Sea of Stars, Super Mario Bros. Wonder and a handful of Pikmin games were dropped at my feet like new toys in front of a puppy, I eventually put Link's latest down and turned my attention to other things in the big, wide world (namely, more video games).

So it is in Mob Factory, a blend of tower defense and factory management in which you quickly set up defenses against waves of worms, spiders, skeletons and so forth - and then set up spawners to create more waves, so you can turn their fallen remains into conveyor belts, walls, and eventually new islands to expand your monster-chewing factories upon.

"To my knowledge," says m0lmy in their Reddit comment, "I am the first person to unlock this character intentionally."

Now that they are known and readily available, it shouldn't be too hard for players to follow m0lmy's guide to unlocking the Robomando for themselves, but be warned: they're about as random as random gets.

One of them, specifically, is the anti-glare screen coating that's present on the 1TB Steam Deck model. In most respects, the Steam Deck OLED is a substantial upgrade to the original, but tech reviewer Dave2D has raised concerns that the etched glass isn't doing any favors to the new OLED display.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["Coming late 2024".
Netflix this week has lifted the lid on its new animated Witcher film, Sirens of the Deep. Perhaps what's most exciting about this upcoming project airing in "late 2024" is that it will see the return of Doug Cockle.
If you weren't already aware, Cockle is the famous English voice actor of Geralt, as heard in titles like The Witcher 3: The Wild Hunt. Sirens of the Deep is based on a short story by Andrzej Sapkowski.

We also saw the Mario Movie finally land a Netflix release date in the US as Nintendo's latest financial report showed just how many coins the big-screen endeavour brought in for the company.

Just days ago, Nintendo launched the sixth and final DLC wave for Mario Kart 8 Deluxe on the Nintendo Switch. The patch notes detailed all sorts of general updates and fixes.
This included a lot of fine adjustments, and we've got some extra insight, courtesy of the Japanese website Mario Kart Blog (via Meester_Tweester on the Mario Kart subreddit). As you can see, there are some balance changes to a number of the vehicles, and also some extra details about the new racers:

Smash T.V. was originally released in arcades in 1990. It was designed by the legendary Eugene Jarvis, the guy behind 1981’s Defender. More importantly, he created 1982’s Robotron: 2084, which is the godfather of twin-stick shooters. Smash T.V. was built as a spiritual successor to that game, so it has all the features you’d expect, which is to say, it is also a twin-stick shooter.


Super Smash T.V. is the title used by the SNES, Genesis/Mega Drive, Master System, and Game Gear versions. What makes it “Super?” Nothing. Absolutely nothing. It’s just a straight port of the arcade title.

The co-op shooter now seems on firmer ground, and to celebrate it's getting a two-part update called The Traitor Curse. Part one will add a new zone and mission, among other updates.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Great Pretender, the exciting heist anime that was made available via Netflix in the Summer of 2020, could be teasing another season to be announced very soon. In a post made via Twitter, the official Great Pretender account reveals a “new release” will be announced on November 18 at Anime NYC.


In the post, an 18-second video serves as a highlight reel of the first season’s exploits, with the tagline “the greatest con artists return to the party,” which seems like a strong gesture towards another season.




In any case, the announcement will take place at a special panel held from 12:45 p.m. to 1:45 p.m. ET in Panel Room 1. The panel is set to feature George Wada, the president of Production I.G. and Wit Studio; Hiro Kaburagi, the director of Great Pretender; and Hitoshi Ito, the anime’s producer. According to Anime NYC’s website, those in attendance will be “invited to be the first to watch the world premiere and win some specially prepared presents from the guests.”


As stated, Great Pretender was released globally via Netflix on August 20, 2020. It ran for 23 episodes across four story arcs, with each arc covering a unique heist for the primary characters to pull off. I don’t wanna spoil it for anyone reading, but if this announcement is indeed a second season, let’s just say it’ll be more than welcomed with the ending of the season finale taken into account.

Naturally it became an internet sensation all the way back in 2007, bolstered further by the release of the source code in 2011 and a tidal wave of fangames that followed.

Now there's an easier way to make those fangames. I Wanna Maker is a freeware precision platformer with level editor and easy level sharing, and it just hit version 1.0.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Roadwarden's creator, the Polish writer and designer Aureus of Moral Anxiety Studio, is an enthusiastic and inventive player of table-top games. Many of his ideas for 2022's finest historical fantasy RPG have their twitching, eldritch roots in pen-and-paper sessions with friends. Take questions of money and wealth. Speaking to me over Zoom one rainy October afternoon, Aureus recalls one particular table-top campaign he ran in which, after 10 or so sessions, the player party had sunk into abject poverty. "They reached a collapsed village, [and] they said, 'is there a cart around here?' So I rolled the dice and decided that all right, there is a wagon, that's completely functional with all its wheels and so on. So they just started to walk around and shove on the top of their wagon, whatever of value they could find. 


"They had no shame!" Aureus goes on. "Just gathering all the scraps of iron, all the tools, knives, musical instruments, pieces of fabric - anything they could find, they were just taking it all with them on the assumption that whenever they reached a civilised spot, they're just going to sell it all."  This was foolhardy behaviour, because all the objects in question were trash with little resale value. "So they at the same time they had more than they could ever need, and they had pretty much nothing. They mainly had a hindrance that was slowing them down - this wagon full of stuff was just difficult to move through the paths."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Netflix's gaming push is looping in one of its larger animated properties. The Dragon Prince: Xadia is a new action-RPG in development, arriving next year on mobile through Netflix.


The project looks to be handled by Wonderstorm, per the official site, and definitely takes after the action-RPG genre. In the reveal trailer, we can see quite a few gameplay moments that feel reminiscent of Diablo, Hades, and the like.




Characters look to run around, bash enemies' heads in, and unleash magic upon the battlefield. Netflix's teaser describes the game as a "hack & slash looter ARPG," and also notes you can team up with friends. Feels very Diablo-y to me.


For the roster, I see a few expected faces, including leads like Callum and Rayla. I'm admittedly a bit behind on the show, but it's nice to see the breadth of choices here. The shield-toting Amaya is a very welcome inclusion, too.


Netflix and games


The online streaming giant Netflix has been steadily making headway in the realm of games. It has a mobile service which has featured access to some notable titles, like 2018 gem Spiritfarer.


The company's also making its own big push into games, through internal measures and external acquisitions of studios like Spry Fox and Oxenfree maker Night School Studio. Joseph Staten, of Halo/343 fame, was even brought on as Netflix Games' creative director.


It does seem like Netflix continues to be interested in games, both on their own and as properties for streaming shows. Whether these efforts pan out will be interesting to see, but it's at least a good sign that Netflix's game service has eschewed the microtransactions that typically plague mobile offerings. Because of that, this Dragon Prince ARPG on-the-go could be one to watch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Xbox console versions of Baldur's Gate 3 are on their way. And it looks like the optimizations made for the Xbox Series S version of BG3 may have some benefits for other platforms, too.


Larian Studios head Swen Vincke shared a look at some graphs for the upcoming port of Baldur's Gate 3. Notably, the graphs highlight how the optimizations being made are addressing an overall Baldur's Gate 3 speedbump: memory.


"Ensuring memory is well under control and having buffer for peaks was the main thing holding us back I think this will benefit all platforms too," Vincke writes. "Still some work left but very close now."




A new horizon for Baldur's Gate 3


The Xbox Series versions of Baldur's Gate 3 are still coming along but planned for this year. While the massive RPG hit PC and PS5 earlier this year, the Xbox version was held off for some time, citing concerns about the Series S, a compromise was finally reached: allowing the Series S version to launch without split-screen co-op.


While the issues initially surrounded parity, seeing as the Series S is a step behind both the Series X and PlayStation 5, it looks like optimizing that port might be beneficial for all. The improvements in VRAM and RAM shown above definitely seem enticing, and if this makes my PC run BG3 better, then I'm all for it.


Plus, it means many more people will be able to play Baldur's Gate 3. Despite a frankly crowded year for big releases, Larian's RPG has been a huge hit for players, including myself. Getting Baldur's Gate 3 on Xbox Series S consoles, and optimizing it more in the process, seems like a real win-win.

While we all have our personal lists, The Game Awards (TGA) packages that into something a little more formal.


We've crafted our way through Hyrule, rolled in the Forgotten Realms, explored the Settled Systems, and swung through New York. As a massive celebration of video games, TGA acts as a sign-off and spotlight for things to come. With its formal list of nominees planned for a November 13 reveal, I figured I'd highlight a few of 2023's dark horse candidates. Commit the box art to memory 'cause I'm hoping for some snubs, surprises, and success stories out of these.

It comes courtesy of Aerothorn, who asks: What is your favorite co-op gaming memory? (along with the additional clarification that these memories don't need to be confined to designed-for-co-op games, but could also stem from playing a single-player game with a friend. "I used to play Descent with me piloting and my friend gunning!" they said).
So which games make us think of happy times with pals and good company? Come and find out below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Speaking to investors in an earnings call this week, GTA 6 publisher Take-Two's CEO Strauss Zelnick had a bit to say about the eternally uncontroversial topic of videogame prices. In news worth holding the press for, he thinks they're pretty cheap for what you get in return.
Zelnick cautioned one investor against "generalising" about the state of game pricing based on the recent fortunes of TV and movie subscription services like Netflix, which have had to increase subscription fees to match their expenses after underpricing themselves initially to grow their audiences. Videogames might be all about subscription services these days, Zelnick said, but that doesn't mean they are subject to the same commercial logics as ye olde non-interactive media. In particular, it doesn't mean publishers are currently able to raise videogame prices, even if they feel like they're overdelivering.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Put your sleuthing caps on, detectives—it’s time to solve some mysteries! We are proud to announce that a whole batch of HeR Interactive’s Nancy Drew games are now ready for public testing:
In Nancy Drew: Stay Tuned for Danger, a soap opera star needs your help in uncovering who is behind a series of death threats that sound a little too real for comfort. 
Nancy Drew: Message in a Haunted Mansion has you helping out with repairs in a Victorian mansion. However, a series of strange accidents, plus some murmurings of a ghost haunting, quickly threaten to turn this renovation into an investigation.
In Nancy Drew: Treasure in the Royal Tower a failed ski vacation at an eccentric castle with even more eccentric inhabitants soon turns into a quest to uncover a lost piece of the history of the French Revolution.
And if you’re looking for something more thrilling, in Nancy Drew: The Final Scene, you will find yourself racing against the clock to find your kidnapped friend, while also saving a historical theater with more than a fair share of secrets from demolition.
The games are available for purchase through HeR Interactive’s website or Steam (Stay Tuned for Danger is not available on Steam, however). Or if you already own a CD copy of the games, their English and Russian variants will also work. To play them with ScummVM, you will need a daily development build. As always, if you encounter any issues, please submit a bug report to our issue tracker.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The fake video games in movies and TV shows can be difficult to understand, for an obvious reason: they're not real games. Their function is providing a few seconds of motion, colours, and noises, and possibly a premise for a plot to riff on. They don't need to be coherent or good. Still, sometimes these glimpses and ideas are interesting enough that I quite enjoy trying to figure them out. Take Gods Of Combat, a fake first-person shooter featured in police procedural show Criminal Minds. Apparently it's such a great game that the only way to achieve a similar high after being banned is hijacking a schoolbus and forcing teenagers to kill each other.
Here's a fun (nonlethal) game we can play together, reader dear: I'm going to describe Gods Of Combat as best I can, then you tell me how you think it works.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As a staunch Nintendo head in the early console days, I would say my affection for PS1-era games is... present, but not particularly palpable. For me, the PlayStation One was mostly a machine to play Final Fantasies VII through IX on, and not much else (it was a very belated and cheap second-hand purchase, I should note, and games were still sufficiently expensive back then that maintaining two healthy game libraries for both the family N64 and my new Squall box was nigh on impossible). Nevertheless, I've been increasingly fascinated by the revival of PS1-era games in recent years, and it's been interesting to see which modern games have been "demade" in this style - see Bloodborne PSX - and which ones have made it their own from the off - see Signalis, Heartworm, and many others. 
Crow Country is the latest game I've seen to take up the PSX mantle, and it combines the chunkiness of Final Fantasy VII-style character models with the grimy survival horror of something like Resident Evil to brilliant effect. Made by SFB Games, the same devs wot made the also excellent Tangle Tower, it's currently got a very good demo up on Steam at the moment, and it's got me thinking: what do you like most about PS1-era games on PC, and which ones are your all-time favs?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you've seen Netflix's Arcane League of Legends animated series, there's a high probability you really like it – the show's great, even for non-League of Legends fans. It tells the heartwrenching story of sisters Vi and Jinx and their struggle to come to terms with each other in the high-tech (and magical) utopian city of Piltover and its seedy underbelly known as Zaun. The first season hit the subscription streaming service in November of 2021and now we know that Arcane Season 2 hits Netflix this time next year. 
More specifically, Arcane Season 2 drops on Netflix in November of 2024. To coincide with the news, Netflix has released a short teaser featuring Jinx. Check it out below:

With roughly a year to go before Season 2, if you haven't yet watched Arcane, which features voice actors like Hailee Steinfeld, Yuri Lowenthal, Ella Purnell, and more, you've got plenty of time to do so – and it's well worth your time!
In the meantime, check out the League of Legends Jinx champion skin that was added to Fortnite to celebrate Arcane, and then read Game Informer's review of Ruined King: A League of Legends story. Read about Convergence: A League of Legends Story after that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[World of Warcraft's expansion pack The War Within, out next year, comes in several flavours. There's the standard version of the pack, which includes access to previous expansions, currency for cosmetics and a level 70 character boost. The Heroic edition gives you all that plus a mount, a pet and extra in-game cash. And then there's the most expensive Epic edition, which includes a pet, two toys, 30 days of game time... and three days of early beta access to the game, yours for $89.99 in the states. 


Naturally, World of Warcrafters are rather concerned about the last bit. It's the first time Blizzard's long-running MMO has taken the paid early access approach, recently adopted by Starfield and Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 - there have been early access betas in the past, but they've been doled out by lottery.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Valve has unveiled its first upgraded iteration of the Steam Deck. Dubbed simply the Steam Deck OLED, the new handheld features several technical and form factor improvements, and it goes on sale next week.
As the name implies, the device boasts an HDR OLED screen to produce more vibrant colors. It also boasts a larger battery for an increased charge – 30-50% more battery life depending on the game, with Valve pointing out that the OLED screen consumes less power.
The device also includes an updated and more efficient AMD APU and Wi-Fi 6E, resulting in downloads up to three times faster for increased bandwidth and lower latency. Steam Deck OLED also runs cooler thanks to its bigger fan and improved thermals. Overall, the device is 5% lighter than the original model.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To quickly recap my Steam Deck OLED review, Valve’s refreshed handheld is brilliant, serving up major improvements to screen quality and battery life while making loads of little quality-of-life tweaks. Its reveal was a surprise, mind – haven’t Valve repeatedly said that there wouldn’t be another new Steam Deck for ages?


Not quite. That warning was always qualified in that a more powerful Deck was still a ways off, and the Steam Deck OLED’s performance improvements are both tiny and a likely incidental result of its efficiency savings. This very point was repeated to me in an interview with Valve designer Jay Shaw and software engineer Jeremy Selan, which also covered the Steam Deck family’s future, its current struggles with intensive big-budget games, and why they want "more, more, more" rivals like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go.

I was told as much on the Steam Deck’s first anniversary earlier this year, and according to Valve designer Jay Shaw and software engineer Jeremy Selan, that stance won't change once the Steam Deck OLED releases on November 16th. In an RPS interview, the full version of which is coming soon, the two developers explained why the real next generation of Steam Deck will take a few years – and why they decided against making the Steam Deck OLED’s new processor more powerful as well.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I didn’t know the Steam Deck OLED existed until last week, and yet it’s essentially something I’ve wanted for nearly two years. As great a handheld gaming PC as the original Steam Deck is, its slightly bland IPS display and short battery life are some definite weak points – points to which newer, shinier rivals, such as the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go, have been happy to apply pressure.
Valve are keen to stress that this OLED-equipped model represents an update, not a whole generational switcheroo. Yet there’s much, much more behind that screen that just some different diodes. This is a lighter, brighter, longer-lasting, sometimes even faster-running take on the SteamOS handheld, and one that sneaks in some surprise upgrades as often as it addresses issues with the original Steam Deck. I love it.

It’s a "definitive" refresh of the existing Steam Deck handheld PC that swaps the underwhelming IPS display for a brighter, more vibrant OLED panel, while making numerous battery life improvements – up to and including a new, more efficient AMD APU – that promise significantly more time away from the mains. It’s not far off either: the Steam Deck OLED’s release date is November 16th, just one week away.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For Vladimir Makarov, the babyfaced villain of Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, trust and morale are irrelevant concepts. As he makes clear to his army of Russian ultranationalists, he is interested only in their quiet, unwavering loyalty. Evidently, Activision expects much the same from its army of COD fans. This latest Modern Warfare campaign follows disconcertedly close on the heels of 2022’s entry because, as per Bloomberg, it began life as a mere expansion. Rather than allow a fallow year, Activision has upgraded that expansion’s status to a premium release, and charged $69.99 for pre-orders - granting early access to the single-player campaign as an enticement.


Instead of Modern Warfare’s usual lead studio, Infinity Ward, development duties have fallen to Sledgehammer, the outfit most recently responsible for 2021’s unloved Vanguard. And in an industry where AAA FPS games now regularly take half a decade to make, this campaign has reportedly come together in less than two years. Reader: it shows.

Erm.


Let's start again. As you may know, Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 - not to be confused with Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 - is out from today, 9th November. Pre-ordering players and a few lucky journos (whom we absolutely don't fear and resent for receiving copies early) have been able to play the campaign since 1st November, and the reactions and reviews thus far haven't been great.

Originally slated to release in 2021, the project has quietly remained in limbo for years, but developer Thekla Inc. has revealed that it’s finally arriving on April 30. 
Braid was first released for Xbox 360's Live Arcade on August 6, 2008, and stars Tim, a boy searching for a princess captured by a monster. The 2D platformer centers on time manipulation mechanics that players utilize to solve puzzles and locate/assemble jigsaw pieces. The strong mechanics combined with its contemplative writing made Braid a critical hit, with many hailing it as a masterpiece.

A faked death finally saw him freed from the shackles of the yakuza with one big catch: he couldn't ever see his family again. Since then, we've had the plucky Ichiban take on the mantle of Tojo Clan nastiness in Yakuza: Like A Dragon (7), with its sequel Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth (8) set to wash up on Hawaii's shores next year. What do we know about Infinite Wealth? Kiryu is set to return as a protagonist alongside Ichiban, with an all-new haircut. And more importantly, what has Like A Dragon Gaiden got to do with any of this? Well, it's a shorter stop-gap between the events of Yakuza 6 and Yakuza 8 that fills us in on what Kiryu's been up to this whole time.
But aside from moreish minigames and a fantastic Agent persona with web-slinging abilities, Kiryu's epilogue is a far cry from Yakuza's best stories. By no means is it bad, it just isn't the best introduction to the series for newcomers, and even longtime fans will struggle balancing his resurrection with its heavy feelings of repetition.

I want someone who really, really loves and hates things, and gives you reasons why.”
It’s a trait which Giovannetti has in common with his Megacrit co-founder, Casey Yano, and has possessed ever since he was a kid growing up in Woodinville, 30 minutes outside Seattle. It’s matched by a competitiveness that first emerged in Warhammer 40,000 tournaments as a teen. Before he was old enough to drive, Giovannetti would ride his bike to the local game store and play until the early hours of the morning.

A week later, in a quarterly financial results briefing, Sony CFO Hiroki Totoki revealed that PlayStation planned to launch more than 10 live service games by March 2026, with Bungie helping the company in the space. In an earnings call held today, Totoki stated that of its 12 live service games, it will only release six by Fiscal Year 2025, which ends March 2026, as reported by VideoGamesChronicle. 
Earlier this year, Bloomberg reported that Bungie was evaluating some of PlayStation's in-development offerings, including Naughty Dog's Last of Us multiplayer project, which is reportedly on ice. It seems that evaluation has led to Sony retooling its approach as the company has delayed at least six liv…]]></summary>

For context, Marvel's Spider-Man 2 outsold Super Mario Bros. Wonder, which is the fastest-selling Super Mario game after selling through 4.3 million copies in two weeks. Marvel's Spider-Man 2 was named the fastest-selling PlayStation Studios game just three days after its release, too. 
Woo! We're incredibly honored to announce Marvel's #SpiderMan2PS5 has sold over 5 MILLION COPIES!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[GTA 6 publisher Take-Two Interactive’s CEO Strauss Zelnick has been on the blower to the company’s investors about the idea of making games using the latest artificial intelligence content generation tools. Echoing his relatively guarded enthusiasm for NFTs a couple of years ago, he’s sort of mixed on them, regarding AI tools less as transformative technologies than simply the latest step towards the eternal industry objective of More, Faster And Better For Less.
Zelnick thinks automated learning and generation tools will make development more “efficient” and games, overall “better”, but in terms of Take-Two’s own bottom line, any gains will likely be offset by the fact that other big companies have access to the same tools, and by the fact that Take-Two will take advantage of said efficiencies by setting more ambitious goals. As such, he doesn’t think using generative AI will lead to lower prices for big commercial games. If you’re a developer that can’t afford to buy or license generative “AI” tools, Zelnick added, you can expect competition to become “more intense” in the coming years. Good stuff.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this summer, amid an incoming typhoon, Game Informer visited the Bandai Hobby Center Shinkan, the 132,000-square-foot factory where the entertainment company manufactures its iconic Gundam model kits. If you purchase a new Gundam model kit at your local store today, it originated in this facility in Shizuoka, Japan. The factory contains 35 plastic color-molding machines – 25 electric and 10 hydraulic – all helping produce millions of models yearly.
Bandai Spirits employee Miyuki Nakagiri, the subject matter expert on how exactly the factory operates, escorts us through the building. Our translator during this tour is Atsuo Yoshimura, a video game production manager who’s worked at Bandai Namco for the last 17 years. Notably, Yoshimura worked on last year’s Elden Ring – Game Informer’s 2022 Game of the Year, and most recently, Armored Core VI Fires of Rubicon. Additionally, Yoshimura was instrumental in helping to coordinate Game Informer’s recent Armored Core VI cover story trip.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Intel's Core i5 12600KF is one of the company's best value gaming CPUs, and today it's down to $155 at Walmart (fulfilled via Newegg) versus its standard price of $220. 
This chip offers solid gaming performance in modern AAA games plus PCIe 5.0 and DDR5 support (with the correct motherboard) all while costing significantly less than competing CPUs like the later 13600KF ($285) or AMD's Ryzen 5 7600 ($229) which offer only marginally better performance at 1080p and are basically the same speed at 1440p or 4K. 
For reference, I saw the 12600K deliver a minimum of 85% of the performance of the later 13600K (and by extension the nearly identical 14600K), while costing 54% of the price with this deal - surely that makes the 12600K the obvious choice?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As regular readers of this column will know, I'm a big fan of OLED TVs and monitors. One of my favourites is Dell's Alienware AW3423DWF, a 34-inch ultrawide that offers a fairly standard 3440x1440 165Hz spec - but its QD-OLED panel makes for a night-and-day difference against your standard VA and IPS panel alternatives, with perfect contrast, near-instant pixel response times, gorgeous colour reproduction and stunning HDR. 
It normally retails for around £929, but today it's down to £739 when you use the code GROUPON8 at Dell UK. That's about as cheap as we've ever seen it, and well worth it for anyone that wants a monitor primarily for gaming rather than content creation or mixed purposes.

Having built yourself a no-name crim, you galloped around cranking out cash and XP by means of glorified sidequests handed down by headliners such as Lamar. Skip forward to 2023, and as Alice0 observed when we discussed Rockstar's GTA 6 announcements this morning, GTA Online is effectively an MMO with ten years of updates, expansions and community projects under its belt. The no-name crim has become the star attraction.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hallowe’en may be over (just), but for this month’s Reality Frights, I’ve got a wonderfully seasonal game for you. It’s the brand-new remake of the grand old mystery puzzler The 7th Guest, a game which Bill Gates notably referred to as “The new standard of interactive entertainment.” In fairness to ol’ William, he said this seven months before Doom blew out the new standard’s insides with a 12-gauge shotgun, shunting PC gamers’ tastes away from kitsch adventure games and toward grisly murder-fests. But The 7th Guest is nonetheless fondly remembered for its spooky atmosphere, alongside its blend of pre-rendered backgrounds and live action cutscenes you could call ‘pioneering’ had it not proved such an evolutionary dead end.
Today, the original 7th Guest looks more dated than Henry VIII, which is probably why this remake replaces everything but the very skeleton of the 1993 original. The game still takes place in a creepy mansion belonging to a murderous toymaker, and still involves six eccentric guests to the house searching for a missing boy named Tad. But it’s otherwise been completely rebuilt, with whole new puzzles and whole new mechanics, all designed to be experienced in first-person VR.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If there's one genre I've never quite had the reflexes or spatial awareness for, it's the bullet hell shooter. I've long admired their intricate dances of orbs and criss-crossing laser fire, but I have long resigned myself to merely being a spectator of such games, rather than an active ship pilot. Cobalt Core, however, is exactly my kind of speed. It's not a bullet hell shooter, but it is about two spaceships facing off against each other in an eyes-locked duel of incoming cannon fire, and sliding side to side to avoid getting exploded as you attempt to unravel the mysterious timeloop your crew of weird space animals appear to be stuck in. Just, you know, in a neat, turn-based fashion, where your opponent's attacks are flagged up in advance, and you must use your randomised deck of cards to weave and dodge your way to victory. It's very moreish, and very Into The Breach. I love it.

According to a new financial briefing from the company, it plans to support the Switch seemingly long after the release of rumored new-gen hardware expected to launch next year. 
It's been a big week for Nintendo, with the company revealing that Super Mario Bros. Wonder is the fastest-selling Super Mario game in the series and that a live-action Legend of Zelda movie is on the way. We also learned yesterday the Switch has surpassed 132 million units sold on the heels of great results for The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and Pikmin 4. Now, Nintendo has pulled back the curtains a bit on its approach to the Switch platform moving forward.

The next game from developer Arbitrary Metric, Roman Sands RE:Build, is... very different, at least on the surface.


The first Act of the new Steam demo sees you staggering onto the beach below some kind of tropical resort. You wander up past the pools to the cavernous lobby and are immediately set upon by haggard guests, who appear to think you're a member of staff. So you become a member of staff, fetching margaritas, tracking down the check-in ledger and running downstairs to adjust the boiler settings. You earn XP from quests towards employee ranks that unlock useful items at vending machines. And you try to work out what you're doing here, and why everybody's so terrified of the sun. I haven't deciphered the mystery yet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rockstar Games will release the first trailer for its highly anticipated sequel to 2013's Grand Theft Auto V, which became the most profitable entertainment product of all time in 2018, next month. As of August, Grand Theft Auto V has sold more than 185 million copies since its release 10 years ago. 
Official news of this trailer from the Rockstar Twitter account comes less than a day after a Bloomberg report that states Rockstar will reveal the sequel, presumably titled Grand Theft Auto VI or Grand Theft Auto 6, this week with a trailer for it arriving sometime next month; Since the release of this report yesterday, Rockstar has confirmed a trailer for the next Grand Theft Auto will, in fact, be released in December. 
We are very excited to let you know that in early December, we will release the first trailer for the next Grand Theft Auto. We look forward to many more years of sharing these experiences with all of you.
November 8, 2023
Game Informer has reached out to Rockstar's parent company Take-Two Interactive to ask about this report and reveal and will update the story if more information is learned. 
The journey to the reveal of the next Grand Theft Auto has not happened quietly. In September of last year, unprecedented leaks gave fans a potential look at the sequel in over 90 videos showcasing secret in-development footage of the open-world crime sequel.  We also learned last year that the game reportedly stars a female protagonist. Bloomberg says this Grand Theft Auto V sequel is set in a fictional version of Miami and features the aforementioned female protagonist as well as a male protagonist. 


While waiting to learn more about Rockstar's next game, read Game Informer's Grand Theft Auto V review and then read our thoughts on Red Dead Redemption II. After that, read Game Informer's ranking of every single Rockstar game.

So. Over the past 12 months or so I got very sick and it didn't go away. Eventually I was diagnosed with severe heart failure, most likely from a virus. It will continue to greatly limit me for the foreseeable future and as such I've had to stop working in the manner I once did.

I therefore look at co-op survival game Enshrouded, with its voxel building, grapple hooks, wingsuits, and think: pah, what tomfoolery. This looks fun. Not at all my sort of thing. It might be yours, though. It's now got a January 24th release date and a new trailer, below.

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2023/11/07/ubisoft-lays-off-over-a-hundred-employees"/>
        <updated>2023-11-07T18:57:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, Ubisoft is the latest developer to join 2023's wave of layoffs. According to IGN, the company laid off a total of 124 employees. 98 of them were based in Canada, which IGN calculates as roughly 2% of the company's Canadian workforce. The cuts included administrative and IT workers, some of whom were employed at the Hybride VFX studio, a company that has worked on shows like Ahsoka and The Mandalorian.


"These are not decisions taken lightly and we are providing comprehensive support for our colleagues who will be leaving Ubisoft during this transition," the company told both IGN and Kotaku. "We also want to share our utmost gratitude and respect for their many contributions to the company. This restructuring does not affect our production teams." Another quote obtained by Kotaku claims that the layoffs are to allow Ubisoft to "to optimize its resources to be more sustainable in the long term."
This news comes after a year of several big Ubisoft releases, including Assassin's Creed Mirage, The Crew: Motorfest, and Just Dance 2024, but that's in spite of the fact that they canceled several games this year and delayed Skull and Bones... again. Unrest at the company has been ongoing as well: back in September, IGN reported widespread frustration after employees were suddenly called to return to in-person working conditions.
Ubisoft now joins Bungie, Media Molecule, Telltale Games, Team17, Epic Games, Naughty Dog, Microsoft, and more on the unfortunately long list of companies that have laid people off in the past year.

The word "anacrusis" refers to a set of syllables that precede the first metrical foot in a line of poetry - an intriguing moniker for a game that is essentially Valve's Left 4 Dead, but set in a 1970s-styled high tech facility reminiscent of No One Lives Forever. I'll be honest, I haven't been keeping up with The Anacrusis, and assumed that it was one of those top-drawer philosophical puzzlers. Come on, there isn't even a pun in the title!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At Apple's keynote event last September, everyone expected them to announce the new iPhone, but nobody expected them to announce that multiple Resident Evil games would be headed to the device. Resident Evil Village hit the App Store just last week, and today, Capcom has let us know when Resident Evil 4 Remake is coming to the platform: December 20. You can see some screenshots from the Apple port below. 

The game won't be available to all iPhone owners, however. Resident Evil 4 Remake will only be available on the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max, meaning you'll have to grab the newest product in order to play this game on the go. That said, it will also be available on iPads and Macs with the M1 chip or later. If you're a diehard Apple fan and have multiple RE4 Remake compatible products, you'll be happy to know that the game also supports cross-progression between Apple devices, so you can start a save file on your Mac at home and pick it up on your phone when you're on the go.
The game is available for pre-order on the App Store now, but players will be able to start the game for free before committing to a full purchase. Its recently released DLC, Separate Ways, will launch alongside it as well. While we haven't been able to go hands-on with this version of the game quite yet, we like Resident Evil 4 Remake quite a lot: you can read our review for it right here.]]></summary>

Bash your way into the castle and you'll be able to stop the aforesaid rain of fireballs, though you'll still have to worry about getting dinged upside the headbone by dudes in plate.

Millenia may have passed since the events of The Talos Principle, but the problems faced by this new society of advanced robo-humans (of which you are number 1000 to be 'born' into this world) still feel all too relevant to the issues posed by the lives we're living today: what is the price of progress? Will we ignore the mistakes of the past and push the world toward irreparable destruction? And why have cats remained loyal to this new race of robo-people, cementing their status as the superior future pet, when dogs have devolved back into vicious wolves? There are some puzzles too, I guess. Those are pretty great as well.

When the original Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl came out in 2021, it was a relatively bare-bones experience, but those bones were solid. Despite lacking many single-player modes, items, and even character voices, the core gameplay was good enough to keep the game afloat until it received refinements via online updates over the next two years. Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2, however, comes packaged with all those improvements and more. Developer Fair Play Labs has learned its lessons, and while the game isn't without its faults, it's a more-than-worthy follow-up.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lords of the Fallen, the spiritual successor to 2014's Soulslike with the same name, hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC last month – you can read Game Informer's Lords of the Fallen review here. After a recent patch a few weeks ago that made the game easier and added in some Halloween festivity, developer Hexworks and publisher CI Games have released its schedule of content for the game and it includes new questlines, two new events, more armor and weapons, and more. 
The roadmap also includes a "regular weekly cadence of updates focusing on bringing further stability, performance optimization, and balancing improvements to the game, including its online crossplay experience." 


Stopping short of specifics, Hexworks says before the year's end, it will add multiple new quest lines to Lords of the Fallen, with the opportunity to unlock some unique armor sets and weapons. The studio says some of this armor and weaponry has been co-created with the community during recent collaborative livestreams. Plus, the studio says "players can look forward to 12 new spells, new finisher attacks, and a whole host of community-requested features, including the recently revealed New Game Plus (NG+) modifier system – a first for the genre, and highly anticipated by the Lords of the Fallen community." 
"At Hexworks, we're incredibly proud of the open relationship we're fostering with our community," studio head Saül Gascon writes in a press release. "We are actively listening to their constructive feedback and working diligently to deliver what we believe, collectively, will elevate Lords of the Fallen further. Every addition to the game is a labor of love, as we strive to push both it and the genre's boundaries."

Since its October 27 release, Remedy has released three updates, including its biggest yet last week, for the game so far. And now, a fourth update is live and while it's one of the smallest yet, it fixes a few key issues.


Alan Wake 2 Update 1.0.9 
PlayStation 5: Update 1.00.09
Xbox Series X/S: Update 1.0.0.9
PC: Update 1.0.9
Xbox Series – A workaround fix for the issue where the audio cut out intermittently in the Prologue. We are expecting a full fix for this issue in an upcoming update.
Room 665 – Fixed an issue (again) with the Echo scene not aligning and unlocking correctly (this was fixed in the previous update, but Echo hell still persisted)  
Local Girl – Fixed an issue with a mouse (with a big presence) blocking progress.
And that's everything in the latest Alan Wake 2 update. Catch up on everything the Alan Wake 2 update from last week fixed with the game here. 
For more, read Game Informer's Alan Wake 2 review and then check out this update where Remedy discusses its development progress on Control 2 and its Max Payne remakes.

It did so thanks to great software sales for new first-party games released this year like The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and Pikmin 4. 
This news comes from Nintendo's Fiscal Year 2024 second quarter financial results, which ended September 30. In it, we learn the Switch has officially reached 132.46 million units sold, getting it closer to the company's best-selling hardware, the Nintendo DS at 154.02 million units sold. The only other console above the DS overall is the PlayStation 2 at roughly 158 million units sold. 


It's possible the Switch reaches the DS' numbers, assuming a new-gen console doesn't end sales of the hardware. And consider…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlayStation integration with X (formerly known as Twitter) is ending for PS5 and PS4 next week via a new update. That means users will no longer be able to directly upload screenshots and video clips from the console to the social media site.
An announcement update posted to the PlayStation Support page states that on Monday, November 13, X integration will end, which includes the ability to “view any content published on X on PS5/PS4, and the ability to post and view content, trophies, and other gameplay-related activities on X directly from PS5/PS4 (or link an X account to do so).”
While a bummer for those who make frequent use of this feature, which offers a simple method of posting gameplay content to the platform, there are a couple of more involved alternatives depending on your platform. If you’re a PS5 user, you can still use the PlayStation mobile app to upload gameplay captures to then post on X. You can read how to do that here. PS4 users have to rely on ShareFactory and do a bit more work, and you can read those steps here.
Microsoft made the same move in April by disabling sharing to X directly from the console and instructing players to instead use the Xbox app on mobile (with some speculating the decision was made to avoid paying the platform's then-new monthly application programming interface (API) fee). This now means that the Switch will become the sole console that supports direct media sharing to X. 
What do you think about the decision to end X integration? Did you use this feature regularly? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blizzard Entertainment has revealed that the first expansion for Diablo IV is called Vessel of Hatred, and it hits the game late next year. The Diablo team revealed this news over the weekend during BlizzCon 2023, which is also where we learned about three new World of Warcraft expansions and three new Overwatch 2 heroes coming to the game. 
During BlizzCon 2023, Blizzard kept Vessel of Hatred details light, stating it will share more details next summer. As for what to expect, it features a campaign that continues the dark tale that began in Diablo IV. "Vessel of Hatred brings players back to learn the fate of the prime evil Mephisto and his demonic plans for Sanctuary," a press release reads. "Travel to the lush jungles known by the locals as Nahantu." 
Check out the Diablo IV: Vessel of Hatred expansion announcement trailer for yourself below: 


Blizzard says Vessel of Hatred will allow players to traverse an exotic new region, vanquish new evils, and perhaps most excitingly, explore fresh ways to kill demons and loot chests with a completely new Class "never seen before in the Diablo universe." 
And that's all Blizzard shared about Vessel of Hatred. Diablo IV's first expansion is due out in late 2024. 
For more about the game, read Game Informer's Diablo IV review and then check out this story about how Diablo IV (and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III) won't be coming to Xbox Game Pass this year, even though Xbox now owns Activision Blizzard. Read about the ongoing Diablo IV Season of Blood after that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blizzard Entertainment has revealed the next three heroes of Overwatch 2, including Mauga, a new duel-wielding tank hero that hits the game next month. Plus, the Overwatch 2 team teased a new DPS hero and Support hero hitting the roster sometime down the line. 
Mauga was actually playable for free as a part of a limited-time trial run for the tank hero this past weekend, but he's already out of the game; his real debut happens alongside Overwatch 2's Season 8 launch on December 5. "Equipped with two chain guns (Gunny and Cha-Cha), Mauga is ready to bash through the front lines of his opponents and tear through anyone that stands in his way with tons of fire-power," Blizzard says about the hero. 
Watch the official Mauga gameplay trailer below: 


Here are some additional Mauga screens from Overwatch 2: 

Elsewhere during the Overwatch 2 BlizzCon 2023 presentation, which is where Mauga was revealed, Blizzard pulled back the curtains on two more heroes coming to the game sometime in the future. The first is a DPS hero named Venture, with a unique Splatoon-ish weapon: 
The second is a new support hero codenamed Space Ranger, and given this hero does not yet have an official title, it's the hero we're expecting to debut in Overwatch 2 last out of these new ones. 
The final piece of Overwatch 2 from BlizzCon 2023 is Clash, a new PvP mode where two teams are tasked with capturing five distinct points on a map. Perhaps most excitingly, Blizzard is bringing back Overwatch map Hanamura as playable in Clash, except under the new name Hanaoka. Here's a look at Hanaoka below: 
For more about BlizzCon 2023, read about the three World of Warcraft expansions announced during the event. After that, read Game Informer's Overwatch 2 review, and then check out our Diablo IV review.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I reviewed Hunt: Showdown for a different parish back in 2019, it was a swampy, stealthy, slow-paced extraction FPS that consisted of weaving through mouldy undead and pockets of inconveniently noisy wildlife, ears pricked for the rustle of a rival player in the bushes. It was a game in which every footfall felt like a gamble and every second lasted an eternity, even before you entered the lair of a giant spider. Fast  forward to 2023, and streamers are playing Hunt: Showdown like it's Titanfall 2, scurrying along walls with scant regard for the NPC cannon fodder below, duelling each other on rooftops with pistol shotguns, and tearing through those poor, befuddled boss monsters like sandcastles.


Thus the fate of any competitive shooter lucky enough to acquire a seasoned pro following, I guess. But still, returning to Crytek's PvPvE shooter has been a shock, and speaking to the development team, it sounds like the devs themselves have been struggling to keep up with the more ambitious players, too. Showdown was never expected to endure quite this long and evolve in quite this way, according to general manager David Fifield, and managing the community's ambitions for the game is as much of a challenge as compensating for the limitations of its ageing engine.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While reviewing Cities Colon Skylines 2, I didn't actually go in that hard on public transport (beyond providing it and making it free), despite the urge. Since then though, it's become a game where I don't so much build a single mega-city as a series of experiments.
Naturally, those experiments devolved from a noble effort to remove the stain of cars into a sadistic urge to drive thousands of my own people on a never-ending hell march.

Late last week, Naver suggested that after obtaining site operators' personal details from Cloudflare, around 150 sites with 2.5 billion annual visits subsequently shut down. While that's a huge claim, just one of those sites accounted for three quarters of a billion visits.

Since it's starting to get toward end of the year season, Game Club will be taking a short break for the next two months. That means we won't be running it this month (November), or next month (December). We will, however, be returning with a fresh set of monthly game selections in 2024, so you can look forward to more group play-a-longs and liveblog chats early next year.
In the meantime, though, we hope you've enjoyed this first year's outing of the RPS Game Club, and we'd love to get some feedback on it for how we can improve next year. Regardless of whether you're a regular Game Clubber or have only ever watched it from afar, please come and join in the discussion below to help us make it even better.

One of the early replies was an "ummm actually," pointing out that you had to be 21 to buy booze in most states, and Thomas Violence responded "I'm one of the dozens of people worldwide that live in a country that's not America". I am reminded of this tweet a lot, and I am reminded of it whenever I log on to Puzzmo, a new daily browser-based puzzle service from Orta Therox and Zach "Zach Gage" Gage.
Puzzmo is great, and currently in a sort of gradually expanding beta where you can sign up to get a chance to be sent a log-in, or existing users can give two friends a log-in (I have used mine already, sorry). Every day you get a few different puzzles, with a subscription model offering bonus puzzles. I've not subbed because I'm just not built for anagram puzzles and I do not understand chess, which form about half of the daily offering, but I enjoy doing the daily fliparts and crosswords a lot. Except. The crosswords always have clues that are very specific to the USA.

The Finals is a multiplayer shooter that seems to take place entirely at this elevated pitch. In the dozens of open beta matches I've played, the result is as thrilling as those other games, but also exhausting. I wish it would chill for just a moment so I could fully enjoy its delights - of which there are many.

        <updated>2023-11-06T14:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this year, we spent time with tha ltd. and Enhance Experience, the creative teams behind Humanity, for a documentary on the game's development.
While, on its surface, Humanity is a puzzle game about leading groups of people to a goal, as its name implies, its story wrestles with ideas of what it means to be human, the nature of groups, and why we always seem to resort to violence. Humanity's story reflects real-world events, showing us the paths we're currently on.
Watch The Documentary:


"Soon after we began making Humanity, a number of big events and movements broke out around the world," Enhance founder and CEO Tetsuya Mizuguchi tells us. "There were human rights movements, the Hong Kong protests, [and] then there was the pandemic. And war soon followed in Ukraine. We had no idea how quickly and deeply AI would infiltrate our society either. I think all these things found their way into the core of Humanity. That question, for example, 'What is humanity? What is human nature?' We would often talk about how people, looked at individually, are good. There are so many wonderful people out there. But when they become a group, or a nation, or even just big groups, at that level, something happens. It's like a different switch gets flipped. And what you see there, that is what we're trying to depict in Humanity."
Watch above or over on Game Informer's YouTube channel to see the full documentary about the making of Humanity. "Violence Is Inevitable" speaks to the core creative team, including Mizuguchi and tha creative director Yugo Nakamura, about the project's origins, its complications and lengthy development cycle, and how it came to show us the nature of humanity.]]></summary>

Now, more than six years later, Fortnite has had its biggest day ever again, bringing in 44.7 million players and 102 million hours of play on Saturday, November 4. 
Epic Games tweeted this record over the weekend, calling it the biggest day in Fortnite's history before thanking Fortnite and OG players.
Way to start things off with a big bang 💥
#FortniteOG. Yesterday was the biggest day in Fortnite’s history with over 44.7 MILLION players jumping in and 102 MILLION hours of play.
November 5, 2023
As for why, Epic doesn't list a specific reason but it's pretty clear it's because of the new season itself. Dubbed Season OG, a short one-month-long season of Fortnite brings players back to the Chapter 1 map for some throwback battle royale nostalgia. Plus, near-weekly updates will take players on a journey from Chapter 1: Season 5 all the way to Chapter 1: Season X. 
Check out Game Informer's breakdown of everything you need to know about Fortnite's Season OG. After that, check out the first official throwback teaser Epic released and then watch this nostalgic Tilted Towers video.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Opinions vary on whether 2005's Boiling Point: Road To Hell was ever, could ever have been, a good game. What's clear is that it was interesting, both as an early example of an open-world RPG and as an infamously broken example of Eurojank. Now it's getting a re-release in just ten days and I'm fascinated to know whether a Boiling Point with fewer bugs has anything to offer the world in 2023.

"The objective is to run over babies in your minivan while shooting cops and other players. It's taking over the dark web... and IRL."
You don't need me to tell you that fake video games appearing in TV shows and movies are typically absurd and terrible. But just because something is bad, doesn't mean it's uninteresting. Having watched dozens of movies and episodes with fake video games, I'm going to celebrate a few over the coming weeks. Some daft fake games have neat ideas, some shows portray their fake games in an interesting way, and some fake games are even quite good. Let's start now with Deadware, an unknown horror movie which does a great job recreating something a bit bad: a spOooky haunted browser game from 1999.

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2023/11/03/hbos-the-last-of-us-season-2-set-to-premiere-in-2025"/>
        <updated>2023-11-03T12:02:03.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this year, HBO's The Last of Us successfully brought developer Naughty Dog's critically acclaimed and fan-favorite PlayStation exclusive to life on the TV screen. Its Season 1 premiere was HBO's second-largest debut since 2010, and its second episode broke records, too. Roughly three weeks after the premiere of the series, HBO revealed The Last of Us would be getting a second season. And now, thanks to a new Deadline report, we know it will start shooting next year and premiere sometime in 2025. 
Deadline learned this at a New York news event, where HBO boss Casey Bloys reportedly told press that Season 2 will head into production early next year, aiming for a 2025 premiere. Unfortunately, that's all Bloys said about the season. But, as noted by Deadline, series co-creator and executive producer Craig Mazin revealed earlier this summer pre-strike that the team was already able to get some work done, adding that the first episode was already written. 


"We got pretty far actually, we were doing great," Mazin told Deadline. "[The Last of Us game co-creator Neil Druckmann] and I had been sitting and talking with [The Last of Us Part II co-writer Halley Gross] and Bo Shim, the new writer that was in our little tiny room with us – obviously not a mini room because we're greenlit proper, we're a real show, and because I hate that mini room stuff."
Considering the first season of The Last of Us covered the events of the first Last of Us game, including its Left Behind DLC, it's clear Season 2 of the show will dive into The Last of Us Part II. We're all still awaiting some casting announcements, like who will play Abby and Lev, but that likely won't happen until the actor and writer strikes are over. 
In the meantime, read Game Informer's The Last of Us Part 1 review and then read our review of The Last of Us Part II.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fortnite Chapter 4: Season OG goes live in a few hours once its downtime is complete, and it brings players back to 2018's Chapter 1 map, with throwback weapons, loot, vehicles, and more, too. While it's technically Season 5 of Fortnite Chapter 4, which follows the previous Last Resort season, developer Epic Games is calling it Season OG, and it makes sense considering how much of Fortnite 2018 is making an appearance.
The throwback nostalgia continues throughout the season because each new update brings with it a different phase of Fortnite Chapter 1's past, starting with Season 5. That means weapons like the Assault Rifle and Pump Shotgun, and vehicles like Shopping Carts, will be featured in both Zero Build and regular Battle Royale Fortnite.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are very pleased to announce today the start of the testing period of two single-game engines: Kingdom: The Far Reaches and Escape From Hell!
Kingdom, was developed and released by Interplay in 1995. Only the DOS version of the game (available on gog.com) is supported. It's a cartoon FMV game, with an inventory, in which you have to guide Lathan Kandor through a medieval world, discovering the magic spells and the items required to defeat an evil wizard. 
Escape From Hell, was developed for Electronic Arts by the game veterans Richard Seaborne and Alan Murphy and was released in 1990. You play Alan in this keyboard-only Role Playing Game and visit Hell, looking for your girlfriend who was accidentally teleported there.
Both games use heavily hardcoded logic which is error prone and requires a lot of testing, so we need your feedback more than ever as they are both incompletely tested. There is sadly only one known demo for Kingdom. Support for the Windows and Mac versions of Kingdom may come later! Please contact us if you have some other demos of both games.
To play any of these games, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker and please take some screenshots along the way!

In dozens of local and international news reports, this 'official' figure is cited verbatim. We have zero faith in it, and we aren't alone. After a silent unreferenced edit, the police press release now reads €366,250, but the government's copy remains intact.

Interestingly, those same sites were also said to have "shut down" in 2022 when ACE member Cavea+ launched a streaming service in Georgia.
