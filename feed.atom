If you have played the previous NBA games, MyCareer allowed you to request a trade after the first season. Veteran fans may remember it as a handy feature for many reasons. 


For instance, when you begin your MyCareer save, you usually pick a team where you have the best chance of becoming a starter. When things didn't go according to plan, a trade was beneficial. This year, however, the same privilege isn't available as of writing.


Will NBA 2K25 MyCareer mode get a trade request?

It brings characters from Big Hero Six and just about everybody from Rescue Rangers to the TCG in a fresh new setting: The Azurite Sea. Characters take to the seafaring setting with brilliant abilities to build a new deck around. 


The Disney Lorcana Azurite Sea set was revealed during September 2024's Lorecast livestream. It's one that's been in the works since the game's creation and brings some very exciting cards to the game. As you'd expect, the set can be used to build upon decks from every previous set, but you could also build a brand new one from cards you pick up specifically from Azurite Sea and still potentially beat your opponents without too many issues.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you’ve been hoping to take The Plucky Squire on the road, or in places where your PC can’t quite go, then you’re in luck — All Possible Futures has revealed that the game has obtained Steam Deck Verification in time for digital release on September 17. 


This is amazing news for anyone with a Steam Deck, as the in-and-out-of-the-storybook adventure can now be played both in and out of the house, and there’s nothing stopping you from taking the cutesy cartoon world wherever you’re going. 




Back in December 2023, Devolver Digital cheekily noted on Twitter they were playing on Steam Deck, so the verified status should come as no surprise to future players. However, it has been a fair while (9 months, but who’s counting?) since then, and I for one was beginning to worry that verification wouldn’t come until after the digital release. 


The Plucky Squire doesn’t appear on the Steam Deck website's list of officially verified games just yet, but just knowing that it should soon be there is more than enough to keep me happy.


If you’re a Steam Deck owner twiddling your thumbs as you wait for release, The Plucky Squire will be joining a long list of other epic games that are verified, including Fields of Mistria, No Man’s Sky, and Baldur’s Gate 3, so there’s plenty to keep you occupied while you wait.

First, we’ll break down the weapons you should use for this build. Do not worry if you haven’t gotten to the later tiers of weapons yet. The base weapons themselves with earlier upgrades will do fine, but you should work your way towards the Relic tier.

The main campaign in Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2 sees you battle against hordes of Tyranids before uncovering the twisted plot set in motion by the leader of the Thousands Suns Chaos Space Marine Chapter. In Operations mode, you'll play out the other side of many of the incursions Titus takes part in, including one incredible battle against a Heldrake. This is pretty Warhammer 40K's version of a dragon, but it's a product of the Warp and, therefore, very angry and hard to kill.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[World War I history enthusiasts, young adult literature readers, and anime fans have something to look forward to next year. Scott Westerfield's alternate-historical war novel Leviathan is getting an anime adaptation, and it debuts on Netflix in 2025.


Leviathan puts a bio-punk and diesel-punk spin on World War I

If you haven't read Leviathan and its two sequels, let me give you a quick sum-up. It's 1914, and the flames of World War I have just started burning across Europe. This isn't our great-great grandparents' World War I, though; in Westerfield's reimagined 20th-century Earth, the forces of the Allied and Central powers wage war against each other with bio-engineered beasts and diesel-fueled automatons.


The story of Leviathan follows two protagonists: Aleksan…]]></summary>

Fortunately, if the stats on one of your new characters aren't as good as you want them to be, you can easily change this through rerolling. Even small percentage changes can be the difference between surviving a wave and letting a bunch of enemies through your defenses, so learning how this mechanic works will help you during your entire Anime Vanguards playthrough.

Some even reward you for specific actions, including dancing, punching, and capturing photos. In this guide, we'll focus on one achievement by showing you how to unlock the Astro Bot Let's Twist Again trophy.


How to unlock Astro Bot Let's Twist Again trophy


Based on the trophy hint, you'll need to find an "iconic marsupial" at the Crash Site. This mysterious character is none other than Crash Bandicoot, who can be unlocked relatively early in the saga. Go up to Crash Bandicoot and dance with him by pressing down on the D-Pad, earning you the Let's Twist Again trophy in Astro Bot.

If you still need to acquire the character, travel to Gorilla Nebula and enter the Az-Tech Trail. Progress through the course until you see a stack of fruit crates. Hit it to place Crash Bandicoot in your collection.

You may also need his Spinning Marsupial animation, purchasable from the Gatcha Lab for 100 coins. Now, locate Crash Bandicoot, who will be to the right of the Crash Site's desert region, and start dancing. You can commemorate the occasion, too, with a photo by pressing down on the D-Pad.


In addition to the trophy, you can punch the marsupial to uncover another distinct animation. You'll also discover plenty more unlockable trophies nearby, including going to the top of the Mothership for the At the Top of My Game achievement or dancing with 100 bots in Bot Bot Revolution. If you need some help, check out our guides on unlocking hidden trophies and the Thick as Thieves achievement.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Golden Blitz event in Monopoly GO is one of the most highly anticipated recurring events in the game, as it's the only way to trade gold stickers with other players. Since golden cards are hard to come by, knowing when the next Golden Blitz event is happening will help you prepare your album and decide which ones to trade, especially if you're nearing the end of a season.


Monopoly GO Golden Blitz event schedule


A Golden Blitz event is currently ongoing from September 11 to 12. The next one will likely occur a week after between September 17 and 21. Although the exact date of future events is unknown, the Monopoly Games season currently has over two weeks until it ends, so the odds of getting at least one more are high.


Typically, Golden Blitz events occur once every one to two we…]]></summary>

You'll even get it in Adept form if you kill all Champions in a Grandmaster Nightfall run.

Here's the god roll for the Wild Style grenade launcher in Destiny 2.

Since you can't trade gold stickers outside of this event, it's a rare opportunity to get specific cards during brief 24-hour periods before being restricted to card pack opening again. 


It's also rare for Golden Blitz events to repeat past cards, meaning you might miss out on one you need if you're not online during a specific time. Let's check out every past Golden Blitz sticker during the Monopoly Games season to determine whether you'll still get an opportunity to trade a particular card.

Back in 2021, Black Tabby Games — an indie studio formed by husband-and-wife team Tony Howard-Arias and Abby Howard — released the first episode of the episodic visual novel Scarlet Hollow on Steam. Visually striking with ink drawings and a deep branching narrative, the duo put the studio on the map from episode one, and fans have been lapping it up since.
But one episodic release just wasn't enough, and in 2023, the team launched Slay the Princess, a visual novel that asks you to do what the game says on the tin: slay the princess. It's an expectations-subverting masterclass that received rave reviews upon its release on Steam. A year later, Tony and Abby are back with an expanded version of the game that's coming to all consoles — Slay The Princess - The Pristine Cut.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I always have one eye on the classics that get added to the PlayStation Plus Catalog lineup. There are some eclectic choices that come up, and that’s what I’m always hungry for. This month, there’s a game you should try. Mr. Mosquito is peak ‘00s weirdness.


It’s a pretty cool month. Not that I’m subscribed to Extra or Premium, but if you are, there’s some cool stuff. Plucky Squire is a pretty exciting upcoming title and Night in the Woods is pretty boss (so I’ve heard). I’ll give you the full list from Sony’s blog in just a minute, but first, let’s talk about Mr. Mosquito.


Image via Sony


Actually, I did a full write-up of Mr. Mosquito. Is it a good game? Not really. However, it’s an interesting and unique game, which makes it worth playing. You take the role of a mosquito that has to harass a family until they all suffer a catastrophic mental breakdown. I can really relate to that. It’s the sort of weird concept that was more common back before publishers learned that the only way to make enough money to feed their super-yacht addictions is to put a dude with a gun on the cover.


You’ve also got Skygunner, a decent 2001 on-rails shooter from back when those were still a thing. There’s also Secret Agent Clank from the days when there was far too much Ratchet & Clank.


Now I will paste… No, wait, they formatted this in a very unpaste-able way. I’m going to have to go through this individually. Okay, well, here’s the list:


PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium | Game Catalog



The Plucky Squire | PS5


Under The Waves | PS4, PS5


Night in the Woods | PS4, PS5


Chernobylite | PS4, PS5


Wild Card Football | PS4, PS5


Space Engineers | PS4, PS5


Road 96 | PS4, PS5


Ben 10 | PS4


Far Cry 5 | PS4



PlayStation Premium | PS VR2 & Classics



Pistol Whip | PS VR2


Secret Agent Clank | PS4, PS5


Sky Gunner | PS4, PS5


Mister Mosquito | PS4, PS5

The Lost Galaxy exit is found not long after you pass the bamboo wall and use the large slide. It'll lead you to a large space with enemies, a bot to rescue, and a puzzle piece to collect.

Steps to unlock the Bathhouse Battle Lost Galaxy in Astro Bot


Your first step to locate the Lost Galaxy exit is to activate the faucet and get the water running. You'll need to do this by destroying the enemies and activating the spinning wheel. Soak up the water to become Astro Bot, the sponge kaiju, and spray the nearby wall of yellow sponges.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The top 25 list for LaLiga has been revealed for EA FC 25, and it's dominated by the Spanish giants Barcelona and Real Madrid.


That's not surprising, given the duo has always been the two top dogs of the league. Both squads have several Spanish and global superstars among their ranks, and many of them have found a place on the top 25 list. Without further ado, let's take a look at who has made the cut, along with the best cards.


Complete list of top 25 LaLiga players in EA FC 25


Let's first take a look at all the cards, along with their overall ratings and base positions.



Kylian Mbappe ST 91


Jude Bellingham CAM 90


Vini Jr. LW 90


Thibaut Courtois GK 89


Marc Andre Ter Stegen GK 89


Antoinne Griezmann ST 88


Robert Lewandowski ST 88


Federico Valverde CM 88


Jan Oblak GK 88


Antonio Rudiger CB 88


Frenkie De Jong CM 87


Rodrygo RW 86


Luka Modric CM 86


Dani Carvajal RB 86


Pedri CM 86


Unai Simon GK 86


Eder Militao CB 85


Jules Kounde CB 85


Nico Williams LM 85


Aurelien Tchouameni CDM 85


David Alaba CB 85


Ronald Araujo CB 85


Mamardashvili GK 85


Iago Aspas ST 84


Alex Remiro GK 84





As far as the ratings are concerned, Real Madrid has managed to trump their traditional rivals. The top three cards all belong to the Madrid giants: Kylian Mbappe, Jude Bellingham, and Vinicius. Out of them, Bellingham has received one of the biggest buffs—he is rated at only 86 in EA FC 24.


Goalkeeper Marc Andre Ter Stegen is Barcelona's highest-rated card this year, followed by Robert Lewandowski at 88. Based on the ratings, Real Madrid should be an excellent choice for many players in Seasons and Career Mode. Inaki Williams also experienced a big jump in his numbers following an impressive year for both the club and the country.


We will have detailed reviews for all these cards once EA FC 25 goes live in early access on September 20.

Nic, I have no interesting ways to describe mushrooms right now. I used up all the mushroom lore I've ever gleaned from real-life foraging when I wrote about Morels 2, and I spent most of that article whining about unicorns. The best I can do as regards Shroom And Gloom is to say that these Shrooms do indeed look very Gloomy, possibly because some mad human has wandered into their warren and is now stabbing and eating them.

A new overview trailer has been released for developer Sam Enright's upcoming RPG Beyond Galaxyland, and it's looking quite lovely, if we do say so ourselves.

Whoa there, pardner, save a few subgenres for the rest of us! I think that's half the New & Trending keywords on Steam in one sentence. If you're mystified, best watch the announcement trailer - it paints a clearer picture, though it does involve a startling amount of cartoon decapitation and dismemberment.

        <updated>2024-09-11T15:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Old dog, new tricks.
A couple years ago, a small studio called Medallion Games released a cute platformer called Grapple Dog, which as you could probably guess, is a platformer about a dog with a grappling hook. The simple premise played host to an impressively well-made and enjoyable adventure that felt like a meaningful homage to — and evolution of — classic platformer game design, although it never quite captured the audience that it deserved. Clearly sales were sufficient to justify a sequel, however, and Medallion Games has now graced us with Grapple Dogs: Cosmic Canines. This sophomore outing for Pablo and friends proves to be an even stronger game than the first one, and we’d highly suggest you give it a look if you’re a fan of 2D platformers.
Grapple Dogs picks up almost immediately where its predecessor left off, which teased that Pablo’s adventure wasn’t quite over with his defeat of the robot, Nul. It turns out that Nul’s antics inadvertently released an evil godlike being named Vyr, which threatens to destroy the entire multiverse if the four pieces of the shattered Allkrystal aren't collected. Pablo isn’t the only hero whose universe has a stake in this brewing conflict, however, and he's soon joined on his quest by another grapple dog named Luna—a no-nonsense, gun-wielding pup who doesn’t have time to play nice. Together, the two set out to track down the pieces of the Allkrystal and hopefully find a way to defeat Vyr before all is lost.

Like most Sonic fans, we here at Nintendo Life love the GBA's 'Advance' Series. We have fond memories of playing through the Advance trilogy (and even the tangentially related fighting RPG and pinball spinoffs) in the early 2000s, but bar the SonicN N-Gage port and a Virtual Console release in Japan, we haven't had the chance to play them on any new hardware since.
With the fan adoration for these games, a remake or remaster feels like a no-brainer, no? Well, in a recent interview with VGC, Sonic Team head Takashi Iizuka confessed that he would be very much up for it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[$699 is the new $599.
Recently, we asked you if $499 would be too much to pay for a 'Switch 2'. 20% of respondees said 'nope', nearly 30% thought it would be too much, and the majority (rather sensibly) said that it would depend on how big of an upgrade Nintendo's next generation of hardware represented.
Yesterday Sony pulled back the curtain on the long-rumoured PS5 Pro, an iterative update to its existing console which offers a spec-bump that, as Mark Cerny said in his presentation, looks to close the gap between performance and fidelity modes. Showcasing a modest but noticeable boost (at least when zooming in on the pixels as the presentation did) to several games in Sony's back catalogue — including Marvel's Spider-Man 2 (2023), Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart (2021), and The Last of Us II Remastered (2024) — the price was then revealed: $699 / £699 / €799.

This might seem unreasonable if you're not into modding, but the price of updating a game is often that you break any mods designed for it. Hence, the parts of Minecraft's history many seasoned Minecraft modders - together with server owners and pro mapmakers - remember most fondly are the longer lulls between updates.

Private Division and Wētā Workshop have announced that Tales of the Shire: A Lord of the Rings Game will be getting its own showcase as part of the upcoming 'Hobbit Day' celebrations on 22nd September 2024.
In case you're unaware, Hobbit Day is pretty well known within the Tolkien community and represents the respective birthdays of Bilbo and Frodo Baggins (the former of which, at 111, hasn't aged a day, don't you know). Generally, some fans like to emulate the celebrations held for Bilbo during the 'A Long-Expected Party' chapter of Tolkien's book, while others simply opt to spend the day with bare feet. It also presents an opportunity for libraries to shed a light on Tolkien's work and get more folks reading - always a good thing, if you ask us.

Given that The Crew is an online-only game, that signalled its death knell… or death horn, more accurately. Then in April, they tow-trucked the game out of people's libraries and revoked their purchases. This led to a backlash, as you'd expect, and Ubisoft are accordingly taking a different approach with The Crew 2 and The Crew Motorfest. They're giving both an offline mode to "ensure long term access to both titles".

There was a time when the yearly NBA 2K Switch entry was something to look forward to. Each year was a step back from the next-gen counterpart, of course, but the Nintendo port offered a near-full-fat experience with the added bonus of portability. Those were the days, eh?

Whenever I visit family in the States and find myself in a derelict shopping plaza or some other place affected by America's depressing sense of architectural planning and overreliance on cars, I can't help but feel a sense of dread.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been looking forward to playing Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 for yonks, but had convinced myself that performance-testing it would have some of my lesser graphics cards quivering in their PCIe slots. All those onscreen 'Nids, yeah? And the stutterfest that was the recent preview build? Surely enough to make a Tech-Priest shed at least one oily tear.
But nah, turns out it’s fine. Pretty good, actually – perhaps not to the extent that you should tackle Space Marine 2 on a crusty notebook (or, for the record, a Steam Deck), but it runs decently on minimum specs and is noticeably more stable than in that preview. The only thing that might offend your PC’s machine spirit is some quality setting weirdness, where dropping or raising the graphics options can produce inconsistent results.

Following the embarrassment of Concord's recent launch and almost immediate removal from sale, Sony has scored a win when it really needed one. Astro Bot launched last week to critical acclaim, sitting with a 94 Metascore and being described as a serious contender for — if not the new owner of — Mario's 3D platforming crown.
If you're out of the PS5 loop and want a little overview, our friends over on Push Square have all the Astro Bot coverage you could want, so definitely check out their glowing 10/10 review:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Qotroidvania.
Over the past few years, Atari has been revisiting its storied history with compilation titles, remakes, reboots, and surprise sequels. So while a revival of Yars’ Revenge really shouldn’t have come as much of a surprise, we have to admit to being a bit taken aback by Yars Rising. After all, what was once a stylish, yet basic top-down shooter has now been transformed into a full-blown Metroidvania with anime-inspired character design, a bonkers, world-ending plot, and gameplay that blends stealth, hacking, and good ol’-fashioned gunplay. Atari, yer mad.
The thing is, though, it works. We can’t imagine that this is the future kids in the early ‘80s had in mind when they first shoved that massive Yars’ Revenge cartridge into an Atari 2600 (and maybe OG developer Howard Scott Warshaw’s long-gestating sequel will be more on par with expectations), but after completing Yars Rising, we honestly couldn’t be more thrilled by developer WayForward’s ambitious interpretation of such a classic.

We've been having a great time with Castlevania Dominus Collection since it shadow-dropped onto Switch last month, regaining our muscle memory as we whip back through Dawn of Sorrow, Portrait of Ruin, and Order of Ecclesia. Though those who have seen the first of these titles right to the end, the real end, might notice that the muscles aren't kicking in like they used to on the final boss fight. Surely we haven't become worse at games with age? Well, maybe not.
As flagged on Twitter by @JupiterClimb, Dawn of Sorrow's secret 'Julius Mode' is now home to an added challenge in the final fight as the big bad's attacks aren't as easily evaded as they were back in 2005.

Forests are a critical preoccupation of mine, actually - check this lumpen thinkypiece I wrote about Alan Wake 2 - but they're also spaces for retreat and reflection, where I can shrug off the angst and lose myself in the spectacle of sycamores and silverbirch, arching over the path. Except. Except that sooner or later I start thinking about the roots.

That process begins with the speedy release of several fan reworkings of the trailer that use something like vanilla Minecraft graphics, rather than the original, unholy fusion of LB Photo Realism and Jack Black. This'll teach Johnny Hollywood to run his grubby hands all over our beloved Creepers, eh.

A modder has cracked open some previously disabled abilities in the official modding toolkit for Baldur's Gate 3, making it possible for folks to create their own levels or alter the game's existing environments. The toolkit (which was only made available last week) previously wouldn't let you do any of that, due to "technical constraints and platform-specific guidelines," according to developers Larian. But modders neither care nor sleep. It took them just two days to worm their way into the devkit's innards and make the impossible possible.

It features ship travel, combat, trade, and base building, and you can do all of it alone or with space mates. It’s got a demo, but it’s also on the cheaper end if you fancy buying into early access. Considering the pricing, I’d say it’s a real looker, too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the grim darkness of the far future, there is only widescreen. No ultrawide for the moment, sadly. As and when they add support for ultrawide monitors, perhaps they should call it "ultramarinewide". Ha ha! Ha. Anyway, here's what's coming in the first round of Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 patches.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not too long ago, Arrowhead dropped a vague list of improvements coming to Helldivers 2, as they admitted "inconsistencies" in their "approach to game balance and direction". They've now published another blog post that torches the vagueness of the previous post with the righteously democratic flames of specificity. Overhauls to enemies are on the way, less-loved guns will be more effective, reworks to armor penetration and health values are on the boil, and they're taking inspiration from "player fantasies" for certain weapons and stratagems. All of these tweaks are set to go live on the 17th September, so not long to wait.

The recent DLC for the action roguelike came out of the oven a little doughy, with enough game-breaking bugs to thoroughly upset some fans. Including one bug that sometimes made the game's final boss accidentally invincible. Ah. Yesterday's patch seems to target the worst of these bugs, and the dev team promise there are more fixes are to come.

"It was too big for a single person to make," Byrne wrote at the time. "This is the root of the problem. It wasn't that I fell out of love with the idea, just that I can't physically do it." That was then and this, thankfully, is now. Byrne has tentatively returned to the project and begun sharing screens on social media.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Black & White was a god game that frustrated more often than it delighted, but which was nevertheless delivered with enough verve and ambition to be worth playing. It's a crying shame that it's not currently available to buy anywhere digitally, presumably because the rights are soaked in a gutter between EA (the original publisher) and Microsoft (who bought and closed developers Lionhead).

If you do still own a physical copy of Black & White however, you might be interested in Openblack. It's a fan-led project to create a modern, open source engine for running Black & White, and its first build was just released yesterday.

"Creature" is perhaps too narrow a word - the game's "playable characters" range from geese, microscopic life and triceratops to menhirs and small rocky islands. Each forms the heart of a diamond of delicately drawn, isometric grid terrain with a baby mobile canopy of clouds and sun. It looks like an illustration from an old botanical or geographical textbook, although the inviting emptiness around the visible area also dimly reminds  me of certain elder RPGs I used to play on Macintosh.

I grab the faulty power transformer without listening, and am immediately electrocuted. Worse still, I have to hammer a quick-time button to recover. This is what it is like to be Jerry, the janitor of a cheap and poorly maintained space station. Jerry is being tasked with repair work beyond his job description, learning the ins and outs of an escape pod's machinery from his co-worker via radio. This may come in handy, as the station is about to explode. Tin Can is not a new game (it came out in 2022) but it is on sale as part of Steam's space exploration fest. And I enjoy a space game that makes me panic while alarms go off everywhere.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Full disclosure: I hadn't heard of Bakeru until Graham mentioned it to me. Graham always has his hands on the video game pulse, gliding them over Xwitter or Steam or wherever and waiting for that "ker kun, ker kun" of a new Cool Thing. And that cool thing is Bakeru, described by its Steam page as "Japan-esque", but is in actual fact, very Japanese. I mean, you travel around 47 Japanese prefectures as a metamorphing tanuki who bashes evilness with his taiko drum sticks. Come on.
What I hadn't suspected was Bakeru's chops not only as a platformer, but as a means to increase your chances at success in pub quizzes. The game is a certified trivia Tardis, where you'll learn all sorts about Japanese culture as well as just like, the colour sepia being a genus of cuttlefish.

This is a fairly standard feature for a lot of blockbuster games, but in the world of Warhammer 40K there are so many mega-scale battles with pitch-perfect composition that I found it hard to resist hitting pause and taking a handful of snaps every few minutes. With a keen eye (and a beefy PC) you can capture some wonderfully violent moments.

Development studio Arrowhead, aka the glorious government of Super Earth, are downplaying the rumours as usual. They're claiming (via in-game broadcast) that the fleeting appearance of a weird purple blob on the map screen is actually the result of fluids leaking from the corpse of a long-dead comms technician, stranded on a server farm somewhere. Who to believe? Ah, if only we had some means of shedding light on the reports. Some way of Illuminating the situation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bear with me on this, but I adore how swordfighting works in Dune. Ubiquitous wearable sci-fi shields repel any attack that comes in too fast, so everyone has to learn this unique, overtly dance-like form of close-quarters combat where every thrust and parry is necessarily slow and considered. Picture it: careful judgments of your movements, weighing up the right time to strike, every measured jab part of a wider strategy that culminates in the kill.
MOBAs are like that. Both in the fights themselves, sort of, where probing lunges lead up to bursts of lethality, but more broadly in each match as a whole. They’re map-wide knife fights, where a thrust is a well-judged lane push and a parry a savvy item buy. At first, playing Smite 2 felt akin to watching on helplessly as my opponents repeatedly shoved their crysknives through my ribs. After 30 hours, it often still feels like that - but I am enjoying myself. Mostly. Despite Valve’s third-person elephant in the lane.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nikhil Murthy's Syphilisation is a "postcolonial 4X game", which might sound like a contradiction in terms. While approaches to 4X and grand strategy vary hugely between games, factions and players, the genre as a whole is firmly wedded to imperial conquest, both structurally and at the level of narrative aspects and set-dressing. Many 4X games are triumphal re-enactments of specific periods of colonial settlement and expansion. All of which is to say that Syphilisation is fascinating. It's a reworking of the genre which dismantles and reconstructs concepts such as diplomacy, research and production. It's also just left early access - find more details and a playthrough video below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been 13 years since the first Space Marine came out. While it wasn't outstanding in the grander landscape of gaming, enough Warhammer 40K fans seem to have cherished the escapades of bulky blue boltgunner Demetrian Titus for the action game to merit a sequel a decade later. It left its story on something of a cliffhanger, with said hero being dragged away to face untold tortures by the Inquisition, the most zealous sect of this preternaturally paranoid sci-fi universe. Today, Titus is free again. Free to stomp towards hordes of alien foes, blast them with a plasma incinerator, and shred the stragglers with a chainsaw sword. Space Marine 2 is an often-satisfying scrapper that has me  convinced of 40K's merit as a crafting ground for excellent-looking environments and creatures, even if I'm not particularly moved by the bland character of Titus and his fellow Ultramarines.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Warner Bros have released the first trailer for Vertigo and Legendary's Minecraft movie, the long-awaited or possibly, long-dreaded adaptation of Mojang's industry-straddling block-builder. Quick disclosure: I worked with Mojang and Microsoft on a book about Minecraft's first 15 years, shortly before joining Rock Paper Shotgun. As such, I am now obliged by the eternal laws of journalistic accountability to state that anything Minecraft-related is rubbish. But even if that weren't the case, I would describe this as pretty dismal.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Babbdi was a game of stark and severe Brutalist aesthetics, and also, a game about playing scales with a trumpet, walljumping with a baseball bat and using a leafblower to fly. Snuck out over winter 2022, it was a sombre but delightful freebie with immense though well-hidden imagination, in which your only explicit objective was to find a way out of a small concrete city.
Now, developers Lemaitre Bros are making a gott-dang 1v1 FPS called Straftat, slated for release on 24th October 2024 with over 100 arenas. It's similarly in love with concrete, but it also has blunderbusses, dual-wielding, Gatling guns, corner-peeking, curved swords, cowboy hats and beehive hairdos.

Deliver At All Costs is a chaotic courier sim set in those heady days that sees the player barrelling around a "semi-open" US town as they take on absurd odd jobs. "From delivering a giant flailing Marlin, to the disposal of an atomic bomb teetering on the edge of explosion," say the developers, "always expect the unexpected." It's maybe best understood by witnessing the moment in the trailer below where the player drifts right through a menswear store, bringing the whole building down. Yep, that looks like a good time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We’re a week out from Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2’s release date, and Saber have put out a final roundup of details in a Steam blog. Alongside a global release time map (or two maps, technically, since they’re pulling that pay-more-to-play-early nonsense), there’s a big Q&A covering all your burning questions about burning 'nids. Among these is a confirmation that, no, the action game won’t be implementing DRM software such as Denuvo.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We've been negligent in our duty as watchkeepers of extreme sports games. Parcel Corps is a light-hearted bicycle courier sim set in a colourful totalitarian regime where the police do not like things to be delivered in time, or at all. Perhaps that's why the game, which was due to arrive on Steam tomorrow, has been delayed until an unspecified date. That's okay, half the news stories we write seem to be about release setbacks. At least the developers announced the delay in a funny and thematically appropriate way.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Risk of Rain 2: Seekers of the Storm released last Tuesday, and hasn’t gone down too well with fans of the co-op roguelite. How not well, you ask? To shreds, I say - it’s currently sitting at 79% ‘mostly negative’ rating on Steam. Among the chief complaints are…uh, everything, it looks like. The DLC is reportedly so bug-ridden that it’s taken many of the base game’s core systems down with it.
Gearbox - who acquired Risk Of Rain from Hopoo Games in 2022 - have since put out a blog with a list of known issues they’re targeting, and encourage players to keep submitting bug reports. Among the listed issues are a boss named Mithrix becoming invincible (“definitely not intentional”), and “an issue that allowed players to get stuck while smelling the flowers”.

Most chilling of all, Aldi have discontinued their Village Bakery Seeded Medium Sliced Loaf (400g), replacing it with deeply inferior Village Bakery Lightly Seeded Loaf (800g). Throughout the chaos, the Maw simply grins, although it does seem to have a few more seeds betwixt its teeth than last week. Perhaps the Maw will deign to spit a single seed at us, from which we can grow the sapling of a new world and finally abandon this cursed, Medium Loafless existence. Until then, here are this week’s PC game releases of note.

With many resurrections and Dr. Who-like regenerations over recent years, some seem optimistic. Government records suggests that business bridges are being built from Hollywood to Vietnam, and back again. It seems unlikely that the resurrection of pirate sites would help in any way.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the first post for my series on "saving" open world design, I complained that many of today's open worlds feel like checklists of formulaic tasks and rewards, their geography a vaporous staging ground for itemisable, cycling content-gathering opportunities, which flies in the face of the sense of freedom and wonder they're supposed to inspire. My interviewees, Elder Scrolls veterans Matt Firor and Nate Purkeypile, argued that this reflects the expense and scale of today's open world productions, which constrains experimental design both at a practical level and in terms of overall direction.
CD Projekt open world designer Jakub Tomczak doesn't, as far as I know, have an answer to the issue of production bloat, but he does have a disarmingly obvious solution to the 'checklist problem', based on his time creating missions for Cyberpunk 2077 and its Phantom Liberty expansion: get better at hiding the checklist. Weave it into the landscape and setting more artfully, with an elegant balance of randomisation and responsiveness to the player's behaviour which keeps everything fresh.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It is with quiet anticipation (and some nervousness) that I await to be stepped upon by a freaky mech in The Forever Winter. If you missed its announcement in May, The Forever Winter is a co-op extraction shooter set in a grim future where you struggle to survive amid an unending hyperindustrial war. Since that reveal developers Fun Dog Studios have mostly been sending out small "burst transmissions" - essentially footage from the hellfront - like this patriotic beheading and some panicked gunfights. But today they've made a longer video revealing an early access release date. And - oh! - it's quite soon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I won an awful board game from Nickelodeon once. I say “won”. Actually, I got disconnected phoning into a competition line after I’d gotten through, got upset loudly, my mum called them to complain, they fast tracked me to the next competition thing, I got the quiz answer wrong, and the presenter pretended he’d heard the right answer and pulled a prize out of the big prize bucket. It was a copy of The Game of Life, possibly the least exciting board game a child can win.
The game was dog water, and there’s probably a lesson in there somewhere about how cool and good it is to whine until you get free things, but we don’t have time for that. Instead, I’d like to draw your attention to Floops Big House Adventure. It’s a grungy, slimy, Aaahh!!! Real Monsters meets Ren and Stimpy Saturday morning shooter. Some of you will already hate it from the header screenshot, I imagine. Personally, the art drew me right in.

It’ll set you back $25, £20 or €25, and my drive-by analysis of the trailer below is that they've done a decent job with the ports.

It'll accompany a new paid Darkest Dungeon 2 DLC, Inhuman Bondage, which introduces a new region, a new hero with "...unique" mechanics and a fresh faction of seemingly excrement-themed fiends to slaughter.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The first time I encountered Jack King-Spooner's work, it was when he sent me a copy of Sluggish Morss: Pattern Circus over hospital wifi late at night. The game was a bright spot in a bad time, which might seem peculiar given that Sluggish Morss often looks like a whale's upset stomach, but it's such a feverishly inventive creation. It blew the dust from my synapses.
The same appears true of King-Spooner's upcoming Judero, on which he is collaborating with Soul Searching developer Talha Kaya. It casts you as a "pagan seer" armed with a big stick, who is searching the mythical Scottish borderlands for evil creatures to clobber. It looks cheerier and airier than Sluggish Morss, with a more overt emphasis on mechanics such as combat, but it has the same pickled 3am energy to it. It's also now got a release date - 16th September - and a new trailer below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I would not be at all surprised to learn that the voice actors in stealthy Mimimi-style cone’em up Sumerian Six are Americans doing impressions of British accents. The opening radio chat between starting squad member Sid and a pal has that telltale charming tinge of overeager cockney. It also contains the words “bloody” and “arse” in quick succession, though thankfully not next to each other. The only piles are the logs Sid’s crouched behind as he prepares to sneak up to a cable car guarded by Nazis. That is the only haemorrhoids allusion I will ever make on this website. Until the next time I have to write about Andrew Wilson.
“Oil just use my trusty knoife” mutters Sid as I take down my first guard. Straight away, the animation and noise indicators evoke the same Shadow Tactics or Desperados III goodness you’re probably expecting. Fine with me - that’s exactly what I’m here for. Mimimi’s closing was a real gutpunch, and while I don’t expect anyone to match their exceptional work any time soon, it’s at least reassuring to see Warsaw studio Artificer picking up the torch.

Please let it still be under 40 – and realise with alarm that, by extrapolation, a lot of the people reading this probably have children. Augh, children! Please excuse me while I go stand on a chair, clutching a broom. I’ve never understood the craze for generating smaller versions of yourself. It’s one of those weirder subcultures you read about in the papers, but rarely observe in daily life. 


I do, however, understand the appeal of same-screen co-op games like Run From Mummies - which, being a bloodless comedy dungeon romp, seems like a fair pick for those encumbered with boisterous selfspawn. Don’t worry, the “mummies” of the title are just regular old disembowelled corpses wrapped in cloth, not those sinister, non-embalmed “mothers” you’ve been hearing about down the grocers.

When ten citizens dropped dead on the roads of one of my settlements in post-apocalyptic city builder Endzone 2, I had to work fast to avoid a sickness breaking out. But graveyards require a lot of space, and if you've already filled your shanty town with a sea of corrugated metal roofs, this poses a problem. Welcome to the pleasant headache of town planning in a post-nuclear world, where most of the land is brown and uninhabitable.

While it's not quite as chaotic and entangled as say, Disgaea, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is one of those games. I'd call it "baroque", but that would be out of synch with developer Sandfall Interactive's stated influences: the new RPG takes place in a molten and fragmented fantasy world based on the Belle Époque or "beautiful era" of late 19th century France. Your job as player is to stop a sorcerous Paintress from painting everybody over a certain age out of existence. We'll circle back to the plot, though. First, the excessively ornate battlin'.

It's a free-to-play game, but has a business model that makes you feel like you're getting a rougher deal than if you just dropped thirty notes for it outright. It's available now in Early Access, but has already been available in a kind of gravity-defying Super Early Access for several weeks (which you had to pay to get into).


All of which has made me feel very tired, and yearn for the days when you went into a shop and bought a game in a box for a set amount of money, and the whole game was in the box and you went home and put it on your PC and played it until your mum said "Richard!" (only my mum calls me Richard) "get off that computer and go outside and get some exercise! Do you want to be dead at 35?" Well, I'm 36 now mum. Nearly 37. So who's laughing through their heart palpitations now?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Update:  This evening, we received the following "communication from the Spiders studio":

Paris, 28th August 2024 – The Union of Video Game Workers (Syndicat des
Travailleurs (ses) du Jeu Vidéo) has publicly relayed allegations concerning the
working environment at Spiders. The false and even defamatory accusations made by
the STJV in no way reflect the reality of the day-to-day working life of the company's
employees and are an attack on the reputation of the studio, whose teams are fully
mobilized to produce quality games and enthusiastically ensure the Early Access
release of GreedFall 2.

Spiders' management is committed to open and constructive social dialogue. After
unsuccessful attempts over the last few days to meet with a delegation of employees,
they have proposed a meeting again by the end of the week.

Spiders' employees are the heart of the studio, and we are determined to maintain an
inclusive and stimulating working environment in which every talent can flourish and of
which we can all be proud.

The email was signed by Consulting Director Caroline Richard and Associate Director Laurence Tovi.

A shiny whippet to the first of you to correctly identify which of these are real, and which were invented for “roguelite word puzzle RPG” Sternly Worded Adventures. Actually, scratch that. I’m not made of whippets, and you can just as easily find out yourself via the Steam demo. I think you should, if only because “I killed a slime by spelling out the word Toblerone” is easily in my top ten gaming moments of the year.

While it would be a monumentally silly heel turn to go back on their promise of only charging Space Marine 2 players extra for cosmetics a mere week and change before the shooter’s September 9 release date,  the new year one roadmap does at least look piously forthright.
Chatting to James at Gamescom recently (possibly from his cathedral ship made out of graphics cards), Saber boss Tim Willits dragged out an armoured horse and proceeded to flog it mercilessly, saying that players don’t want to be sold the equivalent of Oblivion's infamous deadbeat daddy of DLCs. As several of you identified, this seemed like an odd comparison when Spice Maureen 2 specifically plans to charge for comparable cosmetics, although I imagine Willits was referencing the “packs” that his space game’s baubles come in. “Our fans never thought we ripped them off in World War Z,” he said, comparing Space Marine 2’s optional spendables to that game.
Whether you see the cosmetic's pricing as egregious or not, yesterday’s roadmap does look to make good on Saber’s promise to keep wearables and playables separate. Here’s it:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I find it bizarre that people still really like Crash Bandicoot games in this, the year 2024, two decades after the decline of the platform mascot warz. I have ample nostalgia for the old marsupial myself, with his second Naughty Dog-developed outing being a particular obsession, but come now, we're all about deckbuilders, soulsliking and battle royale nowadays, right?
Still, I'll admit to a twinge of disappointment after reading that a Crash Bandicoot 5 was once in development at Crash 4: It's About Time developers Toys For Bob, and might have featured an interdimensional team-up with one of Crash's old rivals. No, not Mario.

The game is now available on Valve's digital storefront, after a year in the comparatively barren underdark of the Epic Games Store, and developers Free Range Games have also released a Golden Update, which adds offline single player pausing, around 100 building objects, and a sandbox mode allowing for non-story-led excavation and settlement of the game's procedurally generated mountains. Plus, new hats and axes! Try not to get dragon sickness.
