We have a confession to make: we were almost certain we knew how this review was going to go before we even started playing The Smurfs - Dreams.
After all, on paper it didn’t appear that anything special was on the cards. Publisher Microids is generally known for releasing solid enough games, but French developer Ocellus is – with the greatest of respect to it – not quite an industry powerhouse, with a few mobile spin-offs based on Talking Tom and the well-regarded Marsupilami: Hoobadventure to its name.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blizzard has released the need-to-know details about Diablo 4's upcoming Halloween event, which will run between October 29 and November 5.


Diablo 4 recently released the Vessel of Hatred expansion, which has reinvigorated interest in the game. The new Spiritborn class is some of the most fun Diablo content in years, so it's a great period to hop back into the action.


Diablo 4 Halloween event details


In a Blizzard blog post, Diablo 4's Halloween event was confirmed as starting at 10 AM PT on October 29. The spooky celebrations will run until 10 AM PT on November 5. Throughout this period, you can log in and claim some limited-time cosmetic goodies for free, as detailed below:



October 29: The Recluse’s Host Mount


October 30: Ichorflame Torch Mount Trophy


October 31: Recluse’s Flask Mount Trophy


November 1: Reclusive Trappings Mount Armor

If you miss the cosmetics on the above dates, don't worry - you can still log in before the event finishes on November 5 and claim them from the in-game store.


While the Diablo 4 Halloween event is active, Dungeon runs will be much more interesting, thanks to Meat or Treat. This "harrowing game of chance" allows Shrines to apply a surprise effect on top of its usual effect when activated. As Blizzard puts it, "Will the Shrine bestow unexpected riches upon you, or will your Dungeon run go up in smoke?"

Nintendo is no stranger to a trademark application, but its latest batch is worthy of note because of how non-gamey it is. You see, instead of bagsying the use of a particular mechanic or other software-related gimmick, Nintendo appears to be trademarking its properties for use in the food and accommodation sector (thanks for heads up, Automaton).
As reported by the Japanese news outlet ITmedia, a public bulletin from Japan's Patent Office revealed that Nintendo applied for 10 different trademarks on October 11th. All were filed under 'Class 43', which, Automaton notes, includes hotel accommodation, food, and drink.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Each year, October 23 is deemed Fallout Day, and this time around, Bethesda is celebrating in style. To kick off celebrations, the developer has made its multiplayer prequel free-to-play for a limited time.


It's fair to say that Fallout 76's 2018 launch was nothing short of a disaster. Controversy after controversy marred the release of what should have been an exciting period for the franchise. A multiplayer Fallout game - what could possibly go wrong? As it turns out, quite a lot, but Bethesda in the years since has released plenty of updates and expansions to make Fallout 76 a worth entry into the franchise.

Fallout 76 goes free-to-play until October 29


You've got until October 29 to try Fallout 76 for free across Xbox, PlayStation, and PC, after which it will become pay-to-play again. This should be plenty of time for you to decide whether Bethesda's multiplayer open world is for you.




Throughout Fallout 76's free-to-play period, the game is available at a steep 75% discount on all platforms, bringing it down to just $9.99. If you've sat on the fence about trying Fallout 76 over the last few years, now's a great time to take the plunge.

Off the back of September's fishing update, No Man's Sky developer Hello Games is looking towards something a little more spooky this month ('tis the season, after all). The result? 'The Cursed'.
It's a pretty creepy-sounding update title, no? Well, it only gets scarier from here. 'The Cursed' will see you exploring a strange twilight universe full of strange creatures and haunting voices. Some of these spectral beings will be happy to observe you fly past, while others will be a little less forgiving, resulting in the game's first large-scale boss battles against your new-found foes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over the past week or so, you may have caught wind of Denuvo  - the makers of anti-cheat and anti-piracy software  - embarking on a PR campaign of sorts, intended to combat negative public perception of their software. In case you're unfamiliar, Denuvo's wares have become infamous for allegedly sabotaging the performance of all sorts of video games, from Resident Evil: Village to Tekken 7, though accounts of the severity vary, and there is an on-going shortage of independently supplied raw data. 
Denuvo's attempts to clear the air include opening a Discord, which they say “ is a key step in fostering closer relationships with game developers, publishers, and players, offering a dynamic, real-time platform for meaningful interaction”. On Monday, Denuvo’s media team reached out to me to offer an interview with Denuvo’s product manager, Andreas Ullmann. Here’s that interview, edited for brevity. 
RPS: In a recent public statement you said “we will stop letting every claim about our product go unanswered". What claims are you referring to?
Andreas Ullmann: It's basically really about the stuff that's posted by the community. So you just need to check out Steam forums, for example. Very toxic, very hostile environment. If a game announces to use any of our products, if you check out the Steam forums, all the claims are popping in. SSDs are destroyed by our solution. The usual performance topics, and we simply don't want to leave the floor to these people who are posting all things about us anymore. We want to also be there for a person who has not heard about us before. We also want to share our view, our opinion on these topics, and also act as a trusted source of information.

In addition to this, Capcom has also provided some heavy discounts to the series on Nintendo Switch, knocking up to 75% off both mainline and spin-off entries (including a few cloud versions, which we'll make clear in the list below).

Square Enix has been putting out some AA mid-tier entries for some of its forgotten franchises lately, including Visions of Mana (not on Switch) and not one, but two SaGa games in 2024. The first one was SaGa Emerald Beyond in April and now Romancing SaGa 2: Revenge of the Seven.
As a remake of the original 1993 Romancing SaGa 2, Revenge of the Seven attempts to bring one of the more popular SaGa entries to the modern age. The original was groundbreaking during its time of release, embracing a non-linear narrative structure and a unique generational party mechanic that not many RPGs had. Revenge of the Seven retains what made the original special, but loses a bit of charm along the way with its poor presentation and load times.

We first got a peek at On Your Tail in the November 2023 Indie World showcase, and now, almost a year on, publisher Humble Games and developer Memorable Games are gearing up for a Switch launch on 21st November.
This one will see you journey to the idyllic seaside town of Borgo Marina to relax, see the sights and catch some rays (and chop onions, according to the trailer). It's a life sim on this level, and the chance to befriend and build relationships with the animal locals (you're also an animal, by the way) gives off the staple Animal Crossing vibes that we've seen from many an eShop release in recent years.

Sadly, for all the plaudits, the game doesn't seem to have earned sufficient megabucks to justify keeping its development team together. Earlier this week, French journalist Gautoz reported that Ubisoft had disbanded The Lost Crown's core dev team after turning down proposals for a sequel and further expansions. Speaking to RPS this morning, Ubisoft have confirmed that "most" of the Lost Crown's dev team have moved onto other projects, while noting that there have been no layoffs as a result.

…I was going to finish that with something about its molars staring back, but I had to quickly Google “do horses have molars?” only to misspell it. “Yes, horses can have a strong sense of right and wrong, and what is fair,” went the AI overview. “Some say that horses can teach people to live in the present and to be authentic.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If there’s one thing that every Fallout game has taught us, it’s that humans never learn their lesson. As if Earth needed to endure any more nuclear explosions, Fallout 76 allows players to launch nukes of their own and even encourages them to do so. 


While obtaining pre-war nuclear launch codes was a privilege only a few in the world had, the post-apocalyptic wasteland hands out codes as if they were phone numbers. If you're looking to leave a radioactive scar upon Earth yourself, you're gonna need to know what Nuke Codes are currently active.


Currently active Fallout 76 Nuke Codes:




Alpha: 
544 03 282




Bravo: 
069 79 747




Charlie: 
411 85 730




Nuke Codes reset every Sunday at 5pm PT / 8pm ET / Monday 12am UTC



What are Nukes Codes used for in Fallout 76?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Trolley dash.
Shin chan: Shiro and the Coal Town is based on the long-running manga and anime series, Crayon Shin-chan (Kureshin in Japanese), about a peculiar five-year-old named Shinnosuke (Shin-chan) and his family. The game follows up on the successful 2022 Western release of Shin chan: Me and the Professor on Summer Vacation - The Endless Seven-Day Journey, which puts this in the lineage of Kaz Ayabe's Bokunatsu series. This time around, we’re working with a mercifully shorter title.
At the beginning of the game, Shin-chan’s family moves to a village because his dad gets a work assignment close to where he grew up in Akita. Playing as Shin-chan himself, you’re tasked with exploring the village and helping out the other people who live there via fetch quests, fishing, and bug catching.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I was little, I really liked what I saw of Shin chan, even if it was just largely flashes of his bare arse on Japanese TV. He seemed mischievous, a bit of a menace, and part of a fun family dynamic. Flash forward to now and I can only describe the lad as… jarring. At least, I think he's an odd flag-bearer for a series of games where you live out a nostalgic, Japanese summer in the countryside.
And I think it's doubly weird that Shin chan: Shiro And The Coal Town opts for a collectathon approach, that doesn't necessarily make the act of living out a Cicada Summer all that mesmerising. But, and this is a big but: I can't stop thinking about it. Of all the games of 2024, Coal Town may have left the biggest impression on me. In a way, I hope it does for you, too.

Ahead of the release of FANTASIAN Neo Dimension release this December, there's a new story about the physical Switch release skipping select locations.
Australian and New Zealand retailers have apparently removed their physical listings last weekend. Aussie website Vooks reached out to Bandai Namco Australia, who distributes a lot of Square Enix releases locally, and it seems the game is "no longer" getting a physical release in these countries.

Throughout the Switch generation, first-party titles have often leaked online ahead of their official launch date. Now, following the reveal of the game's credits earlier this week, Mario & Luigi: Brothership has supposedly leaked online.
According to multiple reports, at least one person got access to an early copy of the title and has uploaded the ROM to the internet. Brothership isn't scheduled to arrive until 7th November, so there could easily be a lot of leaks related to the game's story and characters between now and then.

We’ll tell you all we know below.

Does Sonic x Shadow Generations have Chao Garden?


Unfortunately, Sonic x Shadow Generations does not have a Chao Garden. Even if there are so many references to the Sonic Adventure games from the Dreamcast and Gamecube era, there is no sign of that being anywhere.


That being said, the closest you’ll get to in terms of Chao in Sonic x Shadow Generations will be collecting them in all of Sonic’s levels. 


They’re collectible in the same fashion as you’d collect the red star rings in each level, except there are only three per Act. In total, there are 54 different Chao to collect.


Screenshot by Destructoid


What is the point of the Chao in Sonic’s levels?


The Chao being added to the Sonic Generations portion of the game just adds additional padding. They’re another set of collectibles for those who know all or most of the locations of the Red Rings.


Collecting all 54 will also not unlock the Garden as a result. It’s simply tied to the “Rescue Professional” achievement or trophy. 


However, what’s cool about the Chao is that once you collect them, you can get a more detailed look at them. They’re all different in appearance and reference all different types you may have seen in the past. 


There are Hero and Dark Chao that spawn in set areas, all in different colors, patterns, and even with some accessories. You can find one with a cracked egg as a helmet in Chemical Plant Act 1 which is an obvious reference to the head accessories they can put on in the Sonic Adventure games.

All Poached Basil Butter Sturgeon Disney Dreamlight Valley ingredients


To make this four-star dish, you'll require the following ingredients:



White Sturgeon


Butter


Basil


Lemon

White Sturgeon can be found within the waters of the Frosted Heights. Get your fishing rod and get the valuable fish for your dish. They're from orange ripples in the water; I found them very quickly in my experience. Butter is an easy ingredient to find as it's sold in Chez Remy after finishing the Ratatouille realm's missions in the Castle. 


Basil, which can also be used for cooking Creamy Soup, is picked up from the ground in Peaceful Meadow. Look for its green leaves and you should find the herb fairly easily. Lastly Lemons can be grabbed from trees within the Forest of Valor and Glade of Trust.  All of these ingredients are pretty easy to get, so you should be able to gather them and cook them at any stove around your house or Chez Remy easily. You'll now have the fancy four-star dish to give, eat, or sell in Disney Dreamlight Valley.


How much is this dish worth?


You can sell the Poached Basil Butter Sturgeon for 2,284 Star Coins at Goofy's Stall and you can eat the meal for 4,961 Energy. If you sell it, it will account towards your Dreamlight tasks and goals.

The three games included are Opossum Country, Decline, and Specimen 134, all by Ben Jelter. Two of these games, Opossum Country and Decline are available already on itch.io, so you can play them right now for free. They were created for game jams. Specimen 134, on the other hand, is a completely new game. It’s also supposedly a lot longer than the other two. However, there is a demo of it that you can try.

Sakurai spent just over two years posting videos about his views on game development. In his final video, he broke down what it took to make each video for the channel. This includes the roughly $630,000 (90,000,000 yen) he spent to make it a reality.


Sakurai, known for creating franchises like Super Smash Bros. and Kirby, also explained the rather intense process he set for himself. He starts the video by asking if we think he looks older than he does in his other videos. It seems like a silly thing to ask, partially because the man hasn't aged since 2001. But it turns out, everything that has aired on the channel over the last two years was scripted out and recorded in 2…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Call of Duty Black Ops 6 is expected to go live soon, and we might also have some idea about when Season 1 will begin.


Like all the recent COD titles, the upcoming shooter's live content will be divided into seasons. The start of the first season also marks the integration of Warzone into the new title, so the date is of prime importance. So far, Activision has remained tight-lipped about when the new season will go live. Thankfully, an ongoing promotion by Little Caesars has hinted at when we could enjoy the first seasonal content.


Call of Duty Black Ops Season 1 expected release date


The only confirmed date we have so far is related to the official launch of the game, which is on October 25. Currently, Little Caesars is having a cross-brand promotion with Activision ahead of Black Ops 6's launch, and you can win some really interesting rewards.


As per the information tweeted by CharlieIntel, Activision is planning to launch Season 1 on November 14. If the final date remains unchanged, it will take three weeks for the game to get its first pieces of seasonal content. Till that happens, the Warzone content integration won't take place either, which means that you'll have to be satisfied with Zombies, Campaign, and Multiplayer modes.




Once Season 1 goes live, you'll be able to access the Battle Pass as well. It will be exciting to find out the exact content which will be part of the pass. As usual, there will be more rewards on the Premium version, which can be unlocked with tokens/Vault Edition upgrade.


Do note that Activision could change the release date of Season 1, so take the information with a grain of salt. For now, make sure to pre-load the system files on your preferred platform ahead of the global launch on October 25.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Secret of the Snooze.
It has been a little over a year since Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem arrived in cinemas, and a lot has changed for the heroes in a half-shell. Shredder's Revenge has welcomed not one, but two DLC packs, THQ Nordic has announced a Last Ronin adaptation and, in 2024 alone, the Switch has already landed a pair of new TMNT releases. In short, when Outright Games and developer A Heartful of Games announced they were working on a tie-in to the 2023 movie, our reaction was something along the lines of, "Yeah, that sounds about right."
One year on, and we are quite frankly impressed at how ambitious that tie-in turned out to be. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleashed packs an entire follow-up story into its 15-hour runtime with wonderful voice acting and far more Persona (yes!) influence than we ever would have expected. It's very much not without its flaws — the combat is repetitive, the plot feels bloated, and the performance on Switch regularly moves at a snail's (or should that be turtle's?) pace — but it does aim for something slightly different, and that deserves praise.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Toji, or Tuji if you prefer the copyright-safe name, just got added to Anime Vanguards with Update 1, and you're surely wondering how to get him and his evolution. Well, it can be done relatively quickly, depending on whether you already have a JJK unit you're willing to sacrifice. For more details, scroll down.


How to Get Toji in Anime Vanguards



Screenshot by Destructoid



To get Toji in Anime Vanguards, you'll first have to clear Act 6 of the Shibuya Station Story stage, which drops a special item called the Cursed Worm. After that, you'll have to complete three challanges in order:



Challenge 1:

Kill Dogon — Shibuya Station Story stage Act 1, Shibuya Station Infinite


Kill Transfigured Mahato — Shibuya Station Story stage Act 6, Shibuya Station Infinite


Kill Sukono — Shibuya Aftermath Legend stage Act 2, Shibuya Station Infinite


Kill Jag-o — Shibuya Aftermath Legend stage Act 1




Challenge 2:

Sacrifice an evolved update unit — Click on Cursed Worm in inventory and then Sacrifice.




Challenge 3:

Kill Reanimated Tuji in Shibuya Station Story stage Act 2





After you finish the Act 2 stage, you'll gain Tuji as a reward. There is a small chance that it will be shiny, which gives it a slightly cooler cosmetic. There was a way to get multiple Tujis, but it has been patched.


How to Evolve Toji in Anime Vanguards

Toji is one of the easiest units to evolve in AV, as you won't have to farm random evo materials but instead just get 5,000 kills with him. You can do this quickly by spamming Paragon stages with Thrice mods. After that, visit the Evolution NPC and complete the evolution.


That does it for our guide on how to get and evolve Toji (Tuji) in Anime Vanguards. For more AV content, including our Update 1 tier list, visit the Anime Vanguards section here on Destructoid.

        <updated>2024-10-22T16:44:24.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If recent rumors are to be believed, the Trailblazers promo will go live very soon in EA FC 25 and could feature some amazing cards.


The Trailblazers promo is going to be a returning campaign, as it was extremely well received last year. In EA FC 24, it featured special cards for footballers who excelled in the early season performances for their respective clubs. So far, we have no official information regarding the release date or the cards that will be present in it. That said, here are all the available rumors.


EA FC 25 Trailblazers promo expected release date


Last year, the Trailblazers promo was released right after the RTTK promo. This year, the RTTK campaign was succeeded by the Total Rush cards. Rumors suggest that the Trailblazers promo will be released once the Total Rush campaign is over. If EA Sports follows the expected calendar, the Trailblazers promo will go live on Friday, October 25.


There's also a possibility that the Trailblazers promo could be two weeks long like RTTK and Total Rush. Whether that happens or not remains to be seen, but for the time being, I am expecting the upcoming promo to have two separate releases. If that happens, the second team will be expected to release on November 1.


EA Sports usually confirms the release date of a promo 24-48 hours before it goes live in Ultimate Team.


EA FC 25 Trailblazers player leaks


As of this writing, no fresh player leaks related to the Traiblazers promo have occurred yet. However, we will update the names once there are leaks close to the promo's release.


Here are a few footballers I expect to see in the upcoming promo (these are not leaks, but my predictions).



Viktor Gyokeres


Caroline Hansen


Cole Palmer


Lamine Yamal


Bradley Barcola



It will be interesting to learn all the special cards that could be included in the upcoming promo.

While those items are expensive, you won't need an arm and a leg to buy them - a finger will do. To be more precise, you need  Sukuna's fingers as a currency. Here's how to get Cursed Fingers in Anime Vanguards.


How to Get Cursed Fingers in Anime Vanguards  (UPDATE 1)


Screenshot by Destructoid


You can earn Cursed Fingers by playing Shibuya Station Infinite mode. Don't be confused if you don't see fingers as a reward. You'll get them, but for some reason, developers thought it best to hide this reward from the list. Of course, to play the Shibuya Station Infinite map, you must first unlock it. Be prepared; this is one of the harder levels, as Mohato and his clones come from multiple directions.

After many months of theories and speculation, it seems we have a concrete answer. Twitter/X user Nintendeal recently discovered copyright text for Mario & Luigi: Brothership that seems to confirm that Acquire is developing the game. This is the studio behind the Tenchu series and the Octopath Traveler series (which it developed alongside Square Enix). Although, it is important to point out that Nintendo hasn't officially confirmed this information yet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s been a long time coming, but Dotemu has confirmed that Metal Slug Tactics will launch on November 5, 2024 on PC, Switch, PS4/5, and Xbox Series X|S.


Not only that, they’ve also revealed that three Ikari Warriors characters are being added to the mix, including Clark Still, Ralph Jones, and Leona Heidern. The likelihood that any of them will land on my team is essentially nil unless I’m forced to for some reason. It’s not that I don’t like Ikari Warriors. It’s that I love Metal Slug. Though, all three characters have appeared in Metal Slug games. If you’re wondering about Leona, she was DLC for Metal Slug XX.




It’s been a bit of a protracted wait for Metal Slug Tactics. It was first announced at the 2021 Summer Games Fest. Development was quiet for a long time as the developer was working on multiple projects. Back in June, a demo of it was released, and I enjoyed it. It took a while, but it eventually clicked with me. The Metal Slug dressing feels more cosmetic, as the tactical gameplay is a pretty far cry from the typical run-and-gun format. However, as a simple turn-based tactical strategy game, I think it works pretty well.


It does have a strong roguelite feel to it. You make runs through regions to take on bosses, and gain permanent upgrades. The good news is that this makes the game more skill-based, and you can’t just level up your units. The bad news is that it has roguelite elements. I don’t personally hate that progression style, but it does give me a bit of pause.


Truthfully, I’d play just about anything with Fio in it, so I’m already on board, though this month has been very busy, and the beginning of next month is looking as though it will be the same. I’ll probably get to it eventually, even if it’s not right away.


Metal Slug Tactics launches on November 5, 2024. It will be released on PC, Switch, PS4, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. There will be a physical edition coming later on.

Guerrilla Games has announced that LEGO Horizon Adventures has now gone gold ahead of its expected release on the Switch, PS5, and Windows on 14th November 2024.
You ought to know what that means by now, but for those who perhaps don't, going gold essentially means that core development has been completed and the game can now be manufactured in earnest to meet the upcoming release date.

In my first few hours playing Echoes of Wisdom, every new enemy I stumbled across gave me a familiar thrill: Ooh, I haven’t seen that one yet! I can’t wait to have its power!
I’d flick through my Echoes, discerning the best one to fight the newbie. A Spark defeated a Hydrozol, a team of Ignizols set a Mothula on fire. And when it came to fighting the Electric Wizzrobe, my immediate thought was Do I have a ground-type Echo? before I reminded myself that I was not playing a Pokémon game.

It's set in the 1980s, a premise I now automatically find horrible because I was born in the 1980s and that was, like, a million years ago. You're a kid who's playing a legendary 8-bit game that's said to be possessed by evil spirits. The experience sees you alternating between the surprisingly labyrinthine space of the game, and the increasingly threatening environment of your bedroom, where terrible toys abound. Did you have one of those phones on wheels with eyes as a kid? Whoever invented that deserves a spell in Arkham Asylum.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not many people hit the refund button on Sonar Shock, the indie immersive sim that’s rated Very Positive on Steam. But those that do tend to complain they couldn’t get the hang of the controls. You can understand why. Try to strafe left to dodge an attack from a blubber monster, and you’ll instead rotate on the spot. Attempt to turn the camera with a flick of the mouse, and you’ll discover that your view remains fixed in place - the cursor moving across the screen as if searching for an icon on your desktop.
"The controls are actually one of the biggest points that make people bounce off the game," developer Raphael Bossniak admits.
And yet they’re also a unique selling point. Where last year’s extraordinary System Shock remake embraced the interface and keyboard conventions of modern gaming, Sonar Shock leans into the experimentation of pre-Quake control schemes - long before WASD and mouselook became standardised for the sake of ease and sanity.

Original story: The Caves Of Qud developer has posted a cryptic riddle that sounds a bit like a release date in disguise.

That means absolutely nothing to me. But at least one fan in the comments knows their lore enough to have translated it, resulting in a specific date later this year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in the protean stink of 2013, the beast we call Factorio sprouted in lowercase early access form and began its meticulous, ravenous conquest of the emerging factory sim genre. Some say that Factorio gave that genre life, though I'd point at Dwarf Fortress as one among many notable forebears. Today, the terrain of factory simming is hotly contested by rival piles of conveyor belt spaghetti. I'm not just talking about Satisfactory or Shapez - they're even making philosophical factory sims these days. They have cosy factory sims now.
Accordingly, the immense, smoke-rimmed cyborg eye of Factorio has turned from the exhausted soil to the relatively untapped heavens. Somewhere up there, there is unspoilt territory. Somewhere, there is land that has never known the roar of a smelter - and in Factorio's behemothic Space Age DLC, out today, you will find it.

On the one hand, it's burdened by talk of "crafting", "base-building" and "survival" - all things I have enjoyed but am currently weary of, and which together make the game sound interchangeable with half of Steam. But it's elevated, on the other hand, by talk of living helltrains that eat crocodiles for breakfast. Without further ado, here's a trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a climactic scene of the original Final Fantasy VII, hero and amateur snowboarder Cloud Strife stands with his fellow adventurers as they are about to face a final, possibly fatal battle. With the steely glare of a polygonal warrior on the verge of killing god, he turns to them and says: "Let's mosey!" It's an unintentionally comical moment - an easy-going phrase, as if they're all going to the shops and not jumping into a big glowing pit at the end of the world.
It's a result of the RPG's famously rushed translation. But maybe not in the way you think. A fan translation of Final Fantasy VII has now fixed a bunch of mistakes that were present in the original, and "let's mosey" is one of them. The fix? Have Cloud say it way more often.

In my efforts to achieve the absolute tranquility needed to spend five days shovelling PC game news stories into a ravenous otherworldly monster, I often go for an early morning walk. I tend to do this while wearing my trusty, enveloping Honcho Poncho, because the UK summer is thoroughly behind us and the very air has begun to squelch. Anyway, while walking this morning I think I actually scared somebody into crossing the road. It turns out roaming around at sunrise near Halloween looking like a ringwraith is a great way to become a figure of menace. Sorry, neighbour! I'll wear that nice top hat and opera mask from my socialite days in future. Anyway, let us FEED THE MAW.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You probably still know Fullbright as the studio behind Gone Home, a delicately experimental first-person yarn about a girl exploring her family home after travelling overseas, and learning about the turmoil in her absence. Picture that game in your mind: the quietness of the hallways versus the crash of a thunderstorm outside, the sickly-sweet 90s décor, the fairy lights and screwed-up balls of paper, the gentle amber pressure of cloistered teenage memories.

It's called Cronos: The New Dawn and it's about - bear with me here - going to the past, harvesting souls, then going to the future so they can help you. It's all because you are, um, wanting to find a special rift in the future, so you can go back to a special version of the past. I think. Anyway yeah, it looks kinda fine to good.

Ah well, circle of life and all that. Plus, at least it’s thematic: you’ll have to make sacrifices yourself if you want to progress across its unforgiving deserts. This one’s got shades of roguelite, RPG, strategy, and turn-based tactics. Nothing too uncommon, but it’s the shades of Red Faction, Frostpunk, and Sunless Sea that have me interested.

For well over a decade, Sony argued that modification of game generated code amounted to copyright infringement. The CJEU judgment holds that there was no violation of Sony's rights, since Action Replay ran alongside Sony's game code, only modifying values in RAM while leaving object code untouched.

Previously codenamed Condor, it's called FBC: Firebreak - and I am going to immediately recommend they shorten it to Firebreak, because that caps-into-colon combo is going to wind me up when I'm writing news posts at speed. While I'm throwing my weight around, let me also instantly rebut the pedants who are even now racing to leave a comment saying that, actually, Remedy did work on Smilegate's multiplayer shooter CrossfireX. Yes, they did, but only the single player bits. 


Anyway, Firebreak! Here's the announcement trailer.

It's billed as even more of a horror experience than the base game, and takes place in a research facility run by the Lynchian ghostbuster organisation you may have encountered in Remedy's paranormal shooter Control. As such, the expansion forms a direct connection between the games, and may - read: definitely will - harbour a few clues about the story of the forthcoming Control 2.

The announcement came at the tail-end of Bohemia's 25th Anniversary Concert, alongside some disturbingly gun-less footage of a coastal promontory with rippling ocean waters against a cloudy sky - it reminds me more of The Elder Scrolls 6's announcement teaser than any tactical mili-banger. Perhaps they're secretly making an open world walking simulator? I kid, I kid. Please put the chair down.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in 2021, that dark epoch known as the Pre-Edwin Age, there was but one Ed at Rock Paper Shotgun - the venerable Ed Thorn, aka Edders. Edders had a dream, the dream of Halo Infinite getting a battle royale mode. Like Moses descending from the mount with a Needler in either hand, he bedazzled and amazed us with visions of "an enormous playground stitched together from some of Halo's most iconic maps of yore; Warthogs and Mongooses roaming the lands; players racing to the M41 SPNKR as it spawns; grappling to a rooftop and laying down covering fire; some contrived reason as to why there's a circle of poison gas closing in... but hey, rings are what Halo does best, right? It's 100% doable."
Ed Thorn has always been a journalist of great sagacity and supernatural insight, so it was of no surprise to the RPS editors of the era when rumours bubbled up a few months later that Certain Affinity had partnered with 343 Industries (nowadays Halo Studios) to make Halo battle royale a reality. These rumours have now been confirmed by Certain Affinity's former design director Mike Clopper, who says the now-cancelled mode could have been a "game changer".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ever been in a position where two people are really going at each other, hurling pointed jabs and insults back and forth, and you're stuck in the middle? Well then, perhaps you'll empathise with the enemies in Archons, a twin-stick Vampire Survivors-like where you control two characters at once, and attacks bounce between them automatically as they move about the arena. I gave the Steam Next Fest demo a quick whirl today, and after a couple of swift attempts (I died horribly fast), I realised this could become a bit of a danger to my free time, so I've put it away for now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nepos Games are the two-person studio behind Nebuchadnezzar, which Nate Crowley called "two thirds of an outstanding historical city builder". They've just informed me they're making a new building sim called County Of Fortune, out in Q4 2025. It ain't a city builder, though. In fact, it claims to have murdered the city builder in cold blood, which is unfortunate, because I was really looking forward to a round of Manor Lords later. 


"The city-builder is dead, long live the county-builder," declares the press release, brandishing the husk of SimCity over its head. OK, I'll bite - what's a county-builder then? Well, it's sort of several city-builders having an argument. In County Of Fortune, you seed and grow a number of settlements side by side, then manage their economic and social relations. In other words, it's a game that appears to simulate the phenomenon of culture clash. I'm not sure all this amounts to the wholesale death of a genre, but it's certainly intriguing. Here's the Steam page, and here's a trailer.

After targeting a residential address and four business addresses in the West Midlands, police say a 38-year-old man was detained on suspicion of copyright and money laundering offenses. Police also shared photos taken during the operation, a relative rarity these days but a welcome source of additional information nonetheless.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a recent chat with the Ian Games Network, IO Interactive boss Hakan Abrak said the Hitman developer "absolutely feel(s) like 20 plus years of training for the agent fantasy, creating an agent that travels the world and globetrotting whatnot, has given us some know-how" on bringing James Bond to the greasy screen ("greasy screen" is my new attempt at coining a "the big/small screen" but for games. I foresee big success.)
Abrak is so confident, in fact, that he reckons their Bond project might end up mirroring the World Of Assassination’s trilogy format. "But what's exciting about that project is that we actually got to do an original story,” Abrak says. “So it's not a gamification of a movie. It's completely beginning and becoming a story, hopefully for a big trilogy out there in the future."
It’s a fine interview, worth a read. But I must ask: how are the queues, Abrak? How am I supposed to get excited about a new IO game if you don’t mention the queues?

When another robed cultist spotted what was happening, he tried to intervene, and a kind of Benny Hill pursuit chain began. We ran across a beach, through public toilets, and into the surf. In the end I had to knock them both out. As they lay unconscious, I worried they might soon wake and tell someone what I had done. This can't happen, I hate accountability. I punched their unawake bodies toward the sea in an effort to float the evidence away. But after a few punches the first man exploded into chunks of flesh. I am a murderer now. I was supposed to be a chef.
Streets Of Rogue 2 has a demo out for Steam Next Fest, and while a lot of features are locked up behind the word "UNAVAILABLE" in red font, there's still quite a lot of mischief for you to get up to.

Now, it is notable for three things, the third thing being a cosmic blubber-spire of gurning faces who want to eat your ship and soul. Say hello to the Mara Yama, the ickiest Celestial faction so far. Here's a trailer, in which McConaughey does that thing where he lingers on the sibilants and makes you want to lean in and vigorously mess up his hair.

In response, the STJV called on staff in France to hold a three-day strike beginning yesterday, which the union reports to be underway with the participation of more than 700 workers, via Le Monde.
"This decision is announced immediately after the failure of the profit-sharing negotiations," STJV wrote at the time. “Exactly like previous salary negociations: management’s proposals were inacceptable, the negotiations’ timetable was appalling, and management was deaf to the proposals of the various Employee representatives."

I hid under a stairwell in order to meditate upon my response, then laboriously typed: "No, I just suck." Right on cue, the other player tumbled into view and shredded me with an AK.
The player I met in my second match was more forgiving. "I honestly think the characters need more HP," they said, generously. My wrists need more HP, actually. My eyes and reflexes need urgent patching.

So maybe it’s just me, but there’s a sense of intense freedom and adventure to Keep Driving's Steam demo that belies its prosaic, tractor-tailing subject matter. The opening minutes are oddly silent, until Westkust’s Swirl blasts out from your radio as soon as you drive off toward your first destination - your mate’s house, to hang out and play console games. It comes on strong and sweet; a rush of wind through an open window on a warm morning.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Film, ve kterém většinu času není vůbec jasné, jaká je zrovna motivace které postavy na plátně (např. jestli právě dělá vtip, nebo jestli se bojí o svůj život). To je jeho největší a soustavný problém, ale má i mnoho dalších, například arabské teroristy z "Návratu do budoucnosti" a pointu, spočívající v tom, že veřejnoprávní média vám non-stop lžou a vy jim to štastně žerete (což je pointa pravděpodobně nezamýšlená, protože film spoluprodukoval Český rozhlas). Je velmi smutné vidět dílo, na kterém pracovali lidi, o kterých víme, že jsou schopni vyprodukovat něco zajímavého, a výsledek dopadl takto strašlivě. (Ilča 10 %)]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Riot Games are cutting more jobs at their studios, the company announced today. This is the second time in a year the League of Legends developer has laid off workers. Chairman and co-founder of Riot, Marc Merrill, made the announcement yesterday, claiming that by cutting these jobs the company was "evolving League" and "investing heavily in solving today’s challenges". A total of 32 people have lost their jobs, mostly workers on League of Legends, according to a figure the developer gave to our sister site Eurogamer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You might have caught this one during Day Of The Devs earlier this year. It’s stuck with me since because the developer Tanat seemed like a rad dude, and also because there’s nothing I cherish more than taking a bad pun and just absolutely going to town on it, marrow and all. Building Relationships is about buildings forming relationships in a Love Islandy scenario, though without the reality TV framing you might find in say, Crush House. But the real gag here is the commitment to the bit. Besides that, it’s just a really charming and fun N64-style 3D platformer.
It also features the sort wonky physics that definitely wouldn’t get Ninty’s seal of quality, but work brilliantly here, especially since your character consists largely of angles but still insists on, you know, performing motions.

That's according to game director Dmitry Grigorenko, who observes that enjoyable PvPvE is the "holy grail" of game design, much-sought and seldom claimed. Balancing shooters in which players fight both each other and the bots is tricky, especially in a game as prone to dousing the screen in giblets as Space Marine 2.

But you won't be doing the fighting yourself, God no. Leave that to the squad of Roman gladiators hiding in your back pocket.

The publishers had already made layoffs at Harebrained in the run-up to release, implying that preorder numbers were low; ultimately, Paradox wrote it off as a $22 million flop. At the time of the "parting of ways", Paradox chief operational officer Charlotta Nilsson washed her hands of XCOMlikes entirely, commenting that "a new project or sequel in the same genre was not in line with our portfolio plans".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My earliest memory of the Commandos series of tactical stealth games was my dad bringing home a box copy of the original. “The missions take months. Months!” his mate had told him. Get less shit mates, thought I, for I had already played it elsewhere, and knew that the missions took mere minutes if you put the game on easy then rushed your objectives, bonking nazis along the way. I did not rush the new Steam demo for Kalypso’s revival, Commandos: Origins, but it’s still doable inside half an hour. I had expected a little more, but what’s here has certainly given me some optimism that the full game might well be worth sinking - if not months - at least more time than it takes to wildly lunge at a few nazis en route to your objective.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Two book authors are asking a U.S. federal court to enforce a $1.4 million piracy judgment against Cloudflare. A Moldovan court previously ruled that Cloudflare is liable as it failed to block access to a pirated book offered though one of its customers. The company has yet to pay these damages. The case can have broad implications, but it's uncertain if the U.S. court will indeed validate the Moldovan order.

Now, do you see a horrendous first-person shooter anywhere back there, full of memes and intentionally terrible font choices? Congratulations, you may have remembered 420BlazeIt, a freakish eyesore of a game developed during a 7-day game jam by one of the people behind Crossy Road, of all things. It briefly did the YouTuber rounds, back when YouTube was not yet the anxiety-inducing ad factory it is today. 
Now I'm going to ask you to come back to the present. But prepare for a bit of a shock - there's a sequel coming to that bong huffing shooter. 420BlazeIt 2 has been announced for some months, but now there's a demo you can play too.

I react to this news with mingled happiness and disappointment. Disappointment at the delay, and happiness, because I hadn't heard of Beyond These Stars before. To coincide with the delay announcement they've released a new trailer, below, which talks us through the business of foraging on passing planets. It looks engrossing.

Neva is not a literal sequel to Gris, but it certainly seems to be one in a spiritual sense, as it, too, is a floaty hand-illustrated platformer fond of metaphor. Neva introduces some drama, with combat and a health system (if not actual stakes because of near-instant restarts), and although neither the platforming nor combat are precise enough to be neat bedfellows, I think we should be willing to forgive most of the mess.

They worked well together, so started looking for their next project - something full-time that could take the place of the increasing instability of freelancing.
It was a shared passion away from videogames that ended up moulding the shape that project would take. "We love tabletop RPGs," says designer and programmer Sacchetti. "So when we stumbled into Mörk Borg, and then we started to play, we looked at each other in the eyes and said, 'Why don't we make a game out of it?'"

Or maybe not. Lonely Mountains: Snow Riders is the frosty followup to the mountain biking original, Lonely Mountains: Downhill, and like its predecessor it's about going fast while barely able to see what's coming. Yet also like its predecessor, initial frustrations melted away until I was eagerly hitting the slopes in the Snow Riders demo for just one more quick go.

There's a lot of other character creation bits and bobs, of course, but you'll have to catch a bunch of bass and sell the haul to unlock every boopable nose and bleppy smile.

In Nahantu’s jungles, I linger to take shots of vines spilling from verdigris-kissed cages, of footfall-slicked stone paths and mesoamerican mosaics. Even Vessel Of Hatred’s malignancy feels like a grimly gorgeous tourist trap. Trip Advisor-recommended cyclopean polyps. TikTok viral demonic cysts. I’ve even got a leopard cub to pose with. He’s not sedated, promise. He’s just like that. I told him how much the ultimate edition costs and he’s been catatonic ever since.
I’d like to stick around, but I keep getting ushered along to the next leg of the tour. There are mobs to pop into goo like ripe spots, each fight as slick and frictionless as a pygmy hippo in a butter bath. There are a dozen different tiered resources and event types designed to make repetition feel like progress, until hell freezes over then melts again. It’s fine, Blizzard packed me some wellies. It’s all so comfortable I suspect they’d have thrown in some Xanax and a back rub if they could.

I know, "ExeKiller" sounds like a computer virus, though I think the people who make viruses tend to favour less obviously nefarious names, like "Microsoft Werd". Hang on, that's what I'm writing this article with! Quickly, before I lose this PC to ransomware: ExeKiller is actually a "semi-open" world cyber-Western FPS with retro futurist visuals. It casts you as a bounty hunter plying the dunes and gas stations of a post-apocalyptic Earth, and it looks like a mix of Cyberpunk 2077 and Drive. Here's some pre-alpha footage.

It insisted upon itself, Louis, so I didn’t bother. I still wouldn’t say no to a sequel though, and based on a couple of (admittedly vague) hints from two of the game’s actors, one might already be in the works.

I need to start getting a ‘Gene Wolfe referenced’ reaction image for these things, I swear - although this reference is at least hidden behind a couple of links. Which links? That’d be spoiling the layered environmental storytelling that keeps you coming back. This week, it’s Senior Technical Narrative Designer at Remedy, previously of Fullbright, Bioshock 2, and Where The Water Tastes Like Wine fame, Johnnemann Nordhagen! Cheers Johnnemann!

That long sought after holy grail of sticking your fingers in your ears and going wahwahwah. But it’s not going to be something created by people with talent, vision, expertise, drive, a dream, or a story in their hearts. No, as with everything in our imminent future, it will be achieved by putting a bucket over your head.

"It does something to my brain that I've never experienced before." The developer's just-announced Keep Driving seems a lot less inclined to scramble your grey matter, though it's partial to the old rose-tinted goggles. It's a droll, backward-glancing and slightly ominous 2D management RPG in which you drive to a music festival on the other side of the country. Along the way, you will pick up hitchhikers, upgrade your car, fill your boot with random junk, and participate in turn-based, non-lethal "combat" with dawdling children and obstinate tractors. Here's a trailer.

That game is Konafa Game's Starless Abyss - a roguelite tactical deckbuilder published by Descenders and Yes, Your Grace outfit No More Robots. It puts you in command of a fleet of upgradeable spaceships, who must chase away invading Eldritch aliens hex by hex... and also, hex by hex. This is both hex-based and a game in which you can cast hexes, you see. Oh, don't look at me like that. I had to distil several manifestos into an article half-an-hour ago. I need this.

The press release for this particular Disco Elysiulike has the most actual names on it of the three we've learned about this week. It is also, by some distance, the most outwardly socialist of the lot. It accompanies a website, featuring some blood-red all-caps political manifestos and a fairly exhaustive breakdown of Summer Eternal's workers cooperative structure. Amongst other things, the studio will let people who buy their games form a non-profit within Summer Eternal that gets a share of the revenue, and has a say on company direction.

Yes, this RPG has style for days, maybe even an entire calendar, and an upside of its more dated aspects is that it runs fine on the modest internals of the Steam Deck.

They are bickering about whose game is the true spiritual successor to the rockbottom detective RPG. Is it the unnamed project announced earlier today by new studio Longdue, involving some kind of "psychogeography mechanic"? Or is it this one, XXX Nightshift, a cerebral sci-fi RPG set in a posh polar hotel about a detective "solving gruesome murders, breaking sacred hearts, or just killing bloody time"? It's not for me to choose the dialogue option now appearing in your own brain. But I will say this: at least the one with the horny name has a trailer.

As they attack you, you'll hit them with sick twirls and the 'ol two step, cleansing them of a sickness called the "Stillness". Bonus fun fact: Mentari means "Sunshine" in Indonesian, while Menari means "dancing".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A spiritual successor to Studio ZA/UM’s RPG Disco Elysium is currently in development at the newly-formed Longdue. It's set in a world “conceived by the leads” of the canceled sequel.
A representative of Longdue told us that "the studio isn't ready to talk about specific names at the moment beyond the people mentioned in the press release, but they are looking forward to sharing more about the game and the studio in the future". They did, however, confirm that Disco Elysium's lead writer and designer Robert Kurvitz and art director Aleksander Rostov are not involved.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Perhaps it’s just a testament to the archetypal strength of the image, honestly, but there’s no denying this fallen giant king looks especially gorgeous in Bylina. I’ll move on from his large majesty for a moment though, because it isn’t the only thing this one looks to have going for it. 
It’s a single player action RPG, to start with - a genre I’m always interested in watching evolve in ways not tied to its usual form as a good-boy-points-vomiting loot casino. It’s also based on Slavic folklore, something that’s not too uncommon but strikes a wonderful mix between blackly funny whimsy and intense dread when done right. Also, I’ll take more discordant folk music any time. Trailer below.

You see, Aspyr have just announced that they're porting Star Wars: Episode I: Jedi Power Battles to PC and Steam. I have a complicated relationship  with Jedi Power Battles, in the sense that I think I still have scars on my thumbs from when I played it all night on a busted PS1 controller. I have bled for this game. I'd close my eyes after each six-hours session and see fields of lightsabers flickering and dancing like luminous leeches, chasing me through the Dagobahnian jungles of my dreams.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I will not lie to you, gentle reader. When I first laid eyes on Secret Door's Sunderfolk, while lurking to the rear of a gaggle of journomancers at a preview event last week, I let out an ostentatious sigh. Fortunately, I still mask up to preview events, and am thus free to adopt all kinds of snotty facial expressions without being set upon by burly PRs and shoved into the minifridge for later disposal. To sum it up, Sunderfolk is a hex and turn-based 2-4 player digital boardgame with fantasy animal characters and deckbuilding elements, reminiscent of Gloomhaven. Conceived during the pandemic lockdowns as a way to "bring back game night", but without the traditional 30-minute unboxing ritual, it's played on the big screen but controlled using a dedicated smartphone app, with players stroking and swiping to move characters and play cards.

Instead of trying to stuff in ever more threads, and ever more PC-incinerating clock speeds, the Core Ultra 200S family – spearheaded by the Core Ultra 9 285K when it launches later this year – will dial back certain specs compared the 14th Gen range. Instead, the focus will be on power efficiency and lowering temperatures.

Kind Words 2 is full of touching and drifting remarks like this, written by other players and tossed into the winds for you to find. If you're allergic to vulnerability, or find cuteness or the "wholesome" games trend hard to digest, you've probably already turned your face away. But if your heart is open, even a smidge, if you carry a deep craving to peer through the cracks in the internet to discover a small realm of common humanity, then Kind Words 2 can show you a glimpse of that warm and welcoming world.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Paradox Interactive delayed jail management simulator Prison Architect 2 indefinitely this August, commenting at the time that the game had notable performance issues, and that its system-led design was proving tricky to tinker with. This came a couple of months after the Crusader Kings publisher washed their hands of the sequel's original developers, Double Eleven.
Speaking to me at Paradox's Media Day last week, deputy chief executive officer Mattias Lilja offered a shade more insight on the decision, suggesting that hard-up players have "higher expectations" at present and are less trusting that developers will fix problems. Chief creative officer Henrik Fåhraeus also offered thoughts on what Paradox have learned from the disastrous launch of Cities: Skylines 2 in late 2023. Specifically, he said they need to give actual players access to the game early on, not just testers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hodně mi to připomnělo "On se bojí" nebo filmy Charlieho Kaufmana. "Jiný člověk" je ale "tlumenější" a první půlhodinu vypadá skoro jako normální film, který možná není úplně podařeně natočený. Teprve pak to začne být opravdu divné a vyjde najevo, že to od počátku všechno byl sofistikovaný plán filmařů a že tím asi chtěli něco říct. (Ilča 70 %)]]></summary>

Pojďme natočit něco pro NORMÁLNÍ děti!" A to je škoda, protože tenhle film si klade potenciálně velmi zajímavé otázky, ale většinu z nich ignoruje na úkor roztomilých zvířátek a ujetého robota.
