Alongside Todoroki, Eijiro Kirishima and Mina Ashido are in the Item Shop available for purchase.

With Todoroki on the island, developer Epic Games has added his Ice Wall as an item to the game. With the Ice Wall, you gain the power to summon glacial shields that stand taller than players anywhere. It has a large pool of health and remains in play until its health is depleted. Plus, when you use it, everyone around it is knocked back. They also gain icy feet, which will cause them to slip and slide all over the place.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I don't know about you, but after spending 100+ hours in both Assassin's Creed Odyssey and Assassin's Creed Valhalla, I'm well up for an AC game that reins its open world in a bit and goes back to the sort-of single city stab-athon the series used to be. The ones where stealth actually mattered, and you felt like a proper assassin working from the shadows. Assassin's Creed Mirage is all this to a tee - as Ubisoft have taken great pains to remind us over the last year as they gear up to celebrate the series' 15th anniversary. 
And after spending three hours playing some of its early mission sequences, I can confirm this is very much a game whose sole purpose is to scratch that nostalgic itch good and proper (before we inevitably hurl ourselves into the still very ambiguous void of whatever the heck Assassin's Creed Infinity is). If, however, you don't have much fondness for those older games, and prefer the more action-oriented RPG-ing of recent Creeds, Mirage is probably going to feel like a step backward from all the things you know and like - and you may be better off waiting until the next big open world entry set in feudal Japan pitches up instead.

A patent for a new magnetic joystick design has been filed by Nintendo and the technology involved might just point towards a drift-free future (thanks, IGN).
The patent was actually filed back in May of this year, but it has now been published by the United States Patent Office so we can get a better look at the proposed designs. These show a joystick that utilises magnetism (much like the previously discussed Hall Effect technology) via a 'magnetorheological fluid' to register movement:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The first time I heard of Steam it was, as you might expect, in conjunction with the release of a little FPS called Half-Life 2 back in 2004. You needed Steam to access it, whether you bought the digital version or a retail copy. Given relative unfamiliarity with digital distribution, the nascent status of broadband internet in the UK and US, and the much greater importance of physical game sales at the time, this caused quite a stir. I remember being alarmed by an op-ed over on GameRevolution.com that held forth at length about the risk of conflicts between Steam and other software, if players were outright required to leave it running. How quaint those anxieties seem today - the day of Steam's 20th anniversary. And yet, there's nothing quaint about Steam's ability to shape the field in which it operates.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With "minimal load times" thrown in, too.
Just last week, we heard rumblings that Nintendo's next console — which we're still tentatively calling the 'Switch 2' — was demoed to select developers at Gamescom 2023. The reports from both Eurogamer and VGC suggested that the console showcased an improved version of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, though details were sparse on what these improvements actually entailed. Well, the rumour mill has continued to churn and more reported details are now being shared.
The latest rumours come from a recent Nate the Hate podcast in which the host claims to have been told that the Gamescom tech demo saw BOTW running at 4K 60fps, with the emphasis of the show being that "load times had been erased". Again, this is not to suggest that the Switch launch title will be re-released with the next hardware, only that it was being used to demonstrate to showcase the successor's technical improvements.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There aren't many video game developers who are as popular as Hideo Kojima. He left an indelible mark on the gaming world through the Metal Gear franchise, then managed to reboot his career following his departure from Konami. A new studio, Kojima Productions, was formed, and its first game, Death Stranding, was released in 2019. The studio's mascot is Ludens, and he wears a spacesuit, making him look ready for any adventure. 




Recently, a fan took inspiration from Ludens and created a handmade ring for Kojima. The ring, which Kojima showed off on Twitter, features the Ludens helmet, and the words "60th anniversary" are engraved, likely a reference to Kojima turning 60 this year. The eccentric game creator expressed great gratitude for the beautiful ring.

The significance of Kojima Productions' Ludens mascot


Ludens is the Latin word for play, and it beautifully captures Kojima's driving philosophy. The mascot's name is a reference to the 1938 text by Johan Huizinga titled Homo Ludens. The text theorizes that it would be more accurate to characterize humans as a species of play, as play and imagination form integral parts of human societies and culture. 


The concept weaves its way into Death Stranding, as seen with the Ludens sunglasses players receive early on. It features the following relevant description: "Sunglasses designed with 'Homo ludens' in mind, their form encourages the wearer to never forget their playful side". 




Despite turning 60, Kojima has certainly not forgotten his playful side, as he recently posted a picture of himself holding a Concorde Lego set. He's also shown his love for Starfield, suggesting he's been quite star-bound lately.

Jupiter has today announced Picross S+, the latest addition to the mind-testing monogram series for the Nintendo Switch. What's exciting about this one is that it is set to bring all nine of the 3DS' download-only Picross e games with it — so if you missed out on the chance to download them before their eShop closed, this will be your chance to snatch them up.
The base content (which contains the puzzles from Picross e) will be available for £3.99 / €4,99 / $4.99, with each subsequent entry in the 3DS series becoming available as individual additional paid content packages priced at the same cost. It might seem like a slightly expensive way of bringing each game over to the modern console, but that's a whole lot of puzzle for your pounds.

While I’m socially awkward and people suck, I think romance is one of the most commonly used and easily explained grounding elements in games. I love grounding elements and think that developers don’t leverage them enough. Give your protagonist relatable hobbies alongside their wondrous powers. For bonus points, let me get to partake in them.
Eternights puts this upfront in its descriptions: action-RPG and dating sim at the end of the world. That’s all I knew about it going in. And that’s basically all it is.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With the roaring success of Demon Slayer, Aniplex has been dipping their toes into the proverbial pool of licensed games. 2022's The Hinokami Chronicles brought the series into the hack-and-slash genre to a fairly positive reception. However, the next Demon Slayer title trades the arena battles for dice blocks and minigames.
Announced as Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba - Mezase! Saikyou Taishi!, via Gematsu, players will battle one another in the classic Mario Party formula with a twist. 
As shown in the trailer provided by Aniplex, up to four players will roll the dice, walk spaces around the board, and compete in minigames to win currency to use against one another. Some of the games shown include a cup-and-ball-type game, and one where the players must slash targets as they rise from the ground. Much like Mario Party, some spaces will activate events where you may get an item to turn the tides of the game.

Kamado Party
After some time, the game will transition from day to night, where players will be able to take on the many demons roaming around the board. Once you encounter them, all four players will have to work together to defeat it. The Demon Slayer party game also boasts a roster of characters from all throughout the series, allowing you to choose from a handful of your favorite characters.
Though Aniplex hasn't announced who's going to be developing the game, Aniplex itself is producing the title. Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba - Mezase! Saikyou Taishi! is currently slated for a 2024 release on the Nintendo Switch for Japan, with no mention of other consoles.

In essence, the highs of the episode are probably the peak of The Expanse title so far, but the lows are equally as low. Episode 3 left us—as Camina Drummer—at an old abandoned mining station in deep space. Our oxygen is low and we're all alone after Arlen and Rayen took control of the Artemis and left us.
Drummer adventures back through the derelict station. in an attempt to find a communications panel to activate a beacon and hopefully get help. At the start of the episode, there is a power box puzzle similar to the ones in Episode 3, and then the episode turns into somewhat of a walking simulator. And I definitely mean it when I say "walking."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a post on the official XDefiant website from Executive Game Director Mark Rubin, it was confirmed that the release of XDefiant is currently delayed. The popular FPS apparently received a Not Pass flag in the submission process for certification. The actual process started at the end of July, with the Not Pass result coming in mid-August. According to Rubin, most of the issues seemed to be related to compliance issues.
"We are currently in the CM prep part of that process and will hopefully be submitting to 1st parties in a little less than 2 weeks," Rubin stated in the post. "If that Passes cleanly, then we could be looking at a mid-to-end of September release. There is however a likely scenario where we get a conditional Pass meaning we have to do a Day 1 patch with some final fixes to ensure compliance. If we do need to do a Day 1 patch, then that pushes our date out to early/mid-October."

Typically speaking compliance issues are related to specific issues with first-party platforms. For example, trophies not unlocking properly on PS5, or friends lists not updating correctly. While these are certainly important issues, it's not as big of a deal as game-breaking bugs or crashes. Release delays are never fun, but in a case like this, it's definitely important to have some extra love going towards compliance issues. It's been a couple of years since the FPS was revealed, but fans will have to wait a little longer.
Rubin finished up the post by pointing out that nothing about XDefiant's development so far has been typical. In Rubin's words, XDefiant will release "as soon as we can". XDefiant will eventually release on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S.

NBA 2K24 should have been the perfect platform to celebrate Kobe Bryant's career and his ever-lasting influence on the game of basketball. Instead, his legacy gets overshadowed by omnipresent microtransactions and stale game modes. As a result, NBA 2K24 feels like a dull, lopsided blowout as opposed to a memorable, adrenaline-inducing affair like the ones the Black Mamba often blessed us with throughout his career.

That's one of the best prices we've seen for this spec - if not the outright best; that's reserved for Black Friday - and well worth considering if you're in the market for a high-end gaming laptop.

It's a fun way to stage those perfect shots, and snap pics of your journey through a game world. And photo mode has been a great way to re-engage with Cyberpunk 2077.
With the impending launch of Cyberpunk 2077 Phantom Liberty, the first and only expansion for CD Projekt Red's futuristic RPG, I've been dipping a toe back into the waters of Night City. Much of it is just reacquainting myself, and getting back into the world and feel of it all. I've already spent at least an above-average amount of time both playing and talking about Cyberpunk 2077.

The year is 1991. 'Video games' — plastic, square-shaped cartridges that millions of people blow into every day — grip early-adopting proselytizers. Yet they don’t know their precious cartridge’s days are numbered. A mighty company from Kyoto rules the industry today, but a new laser-based challenger is lurking in the bushes.
Is it the mighty Sony PlayStation? No, not for another three years. Is it the Sega CD? Well, actually, that’s coming in a couple of days. But today, on December 3rd, 1991, the Philips CD-i has arrived. Its name is short for 'Compact Disc-Interactive,' which suggests the device plays CDs, naturally, but it can also play video games… though not very well.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Microsoft acquired Bethesda Game Studios for $7.5 billion in 2021, it was made abundantly clear some of Bethesda’s upcoming fare would be exclusive to Xbox and PC. Yet, when Starfield launched, some PlayStation fans seemed to take umbrage with that. So much so that a mod has been created, the purpose of which is solely to take the Bethesda splash screen that plays when you load up the game … and replace it with the PlayStation Studios intro.
https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1699784591870218729
Talk about aesthetic-only mod choices
It’d be one thing if the mod had other purposes, and this was just one of them … but that’s not the case here. It's just a new intro, and it's hilarious in a multitude of ways. I know that some folks are going to read this story and get wrapped up in the console wars, to which I say … no matter how many times you load up Starfield and see the PlayStation Studios intro, you’re still playing it on a PC (at least, until this mod comes to consoles). 
Now, I’m all for the freedom to create and use whatever mods your heart desires. Note how I’m not saying you shouldn’t use this mod; only that you shouldn’t be surprised when someone calls it silly.

Or have some Raid bosses become overhyped Strike targets rather than top-end world-ending threats?
While we don't aim to make any of the following Destiny 2 Raid bosses seem like outright pushovers, one could easily argue that that's precisely what some of them are.

Nintendo isn't always the easiest company to predict, but things are usually pretty routine when it comes to Direct Showcases. There's usually one in February, usually one in the summer and usually one in September — plus a handful of Indie Worlds, Partner Showcases or game-specific presentations thrown in for good measure.
We're in September now (almost halfway through, even) and an event is still yet to be announced (at the time of writing, that is), so there's only one thing for it: let the speculation begin.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Embracer Group is a large company that has its fingers in quite a few pies. In 2021, Gearbox Entertainment was acquired by Embracer for an eye-watering $1.3 billion. Despite the pricey purchase, it seems not all is well, and a report from Reuters claims that Embracer is considering its options with Gearbox.
Reuters, citing three people familiar with the matter, states that the involved parties are working with Goldman Sachs and Aream & Co to explore a possible sale, and this comes after Embracer received interest from third parties. This is certainly big news, but it's not entirely a surprise, as Embracer had previously made it known that the company is undergoing drastic changes.
In June, the company released an open letter explaining that it is aiming to shift from a "heavy-investment-mo…]]></summary>

After all, the first notable balance patch for Elden Ring hit after roughly the same amount of time. For Armored Core 6, FromSoftware has released a new patch to seemingly address some of the bigger talking points that the game has seen since release. It buffs a variety of weapons while adjusting "certain attacks” performed by a few bosses.
Among the boss names listed here is Balteus, who has already developed a fierce reputation. After a string of relatively easy missions in Chapter 1, Balteus shows up as an abrupt difficulty spike. For players still trying to learn the game's core mechanics, this fight can grind progress to a halt. While the patch notes don’t specifically …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hitting pause in a video game is like dropping a wall across it. On one side of the wall lies what is called the diegetic space of the game, aka the fictitious world, which is generally the aspect that receives the most interest, the aspect that tends to attract the weasel word "immersive". On the other side of the wall lie menus, settings and other features that form a non-diegetic layer of bald operator functions - technical conveniences and lists of things to tweak or customise, from graphics modes to character inventory, that are cut adrift in a vacuum outside of time. 


In theory, the pause screen and its contents are not truly part of the game. There is no temporality, no sense of place, no threat, no possibility of play, no character or narrative, no save the princess, no press X to Jason or pay respects, no gather your party before travelling forth. As the scholar Madison Schmalzer points out in the paper I'm wonkily paraphrasing here, "the language of the menu itself emphasizes the menu's position as outside of gameplay by labeling the option to continue as 'resume game.' The game world is always privileged as the site that gameplay happens."

When the director Todd Howard was asked about these issues, he responded in a way that some might say was tone-deaf. Notably, he said that Starfield was optimized and that some PC gamers might simply need to upgrade their rigs for it to run properly. A bold statement, to be sure, but one that may also ring hollow following some strange discoveries from the open-source community.
According to Hans-Kristian Arntzen, a prominent open-source developer working on Vkd3d, a DirectX 12 to Vulkan translation layer, Starfield is not interacting properly with graphics card drivers. Arntzen di…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the biggest draws about Starfield is the number of planets you can explore. It's not so much an open-world game as it is more of an open-galaxy title. With that, you might understandably want these giant balls of rock to look their best. That's where the modding community comes into its own.
You see, while Starfield's planets do look pretty good, especially from low orbit, they evidently could stand to look prettier. That's why Nexus Mods user Revan (as spotted by DSO Gaming) has brought us their texture pack for a visual boost to some of the game's planets.
[caption id="attachment_403598" align="aligncenter" width="640"] Image via Revan/Nexus Mods.[/caption]
Upscaling the vanilla look to 8K, this mod aims to give a more "realistic" look to these potential homesteads. At the moment, textures focus on the Sol System, which includes Earth, Earth's moon, Mars, Venus, and Jupiter. Revan is also upscaling the other "biomemasks" planets, with 90 of 555 done so far. The mod will be updated with more textures as they go along.
Console mod support inbound
Already, Starfield modders have been keeping themselves busy, and there are plenty being released all the time. In a more official capacity, Todd Howard recently confirmed the game would be getting Creation Kit mod support in 2024. This means that custom content for the Xbox Series X|S version of the game will be on the horizon.
Going down as the biggest launch in Bethesda's history, Starfield is a product several years in the making. From Howard's initial pitch back in 2013 to the release of the finished product just recently, it seems as though the hype has been worth it for the most part.

This is according to a new ESRB rating that popped up, which added Switch as a platform to its listing. Note that ESRB ratings don't usually apply to Switch cloud-based games, so in all likelihood, this is a legitimate port. We've reached out to WB for clarification.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If there's one thing that can be said about Skyrim, it's that it at least has longevity. That; and the fact that it's one of the most successful RPGs in recent memory. Part of the reason it's still going strong after 12 years is due to the modding community. The Elder Scrolls 5 has so many mods, including this recent one for all you Garret-from-Thief wannabees.
Over on Nexus Mods, user Elsawirr has uploaded "Immersive Carcass Carrying." As you can guess from the name, this is a way of allowing you to carry those dead bodies that you "find" in Tamriel. This is actually based on a previous mod they made that did the same thing. However, it's now been improved upon with new animations and the removal of the "carry weight penalty."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dp0_tAK0yc
A quick video shows it in action, with the Dragonborn seen carrying a dead moose over their shoulder. Indeed, it does look more immersive as they stroll through Whiterun and wait patiently in line at one of the food stalls. Very RDR2.
Skyrim: a different beast these days
In this modern gaming era, it's not uncommon for people to poo-poo the vanilla version of TES5. With so many custom mods to download – especially on PC – many players prefer to tinker with Bethesda's epic RPG. While some are just there to tweak the gameplay, others (such as this one) improve the overall immersion. Then there are those that are just kind of out there and wild. You know the ones.
At any rate, Skyrim is still kicking it more than a decade after its release. Other games can only dream of being in the limelight for this length of time. Now, we just need to see whether Starfield can boast as big a legacy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since Dead by Daylight released in 2016, we've seen so many horror crossovers. The most recent one was when the Xenomorph from Alien was incorporated into the asymmetrical survival game. Now, developer Behaviour Interactive seems eager to join up with the Five Nights universe.
In a recent Reddit AMA conducted by the studio (as spotted by The Gamer), several members of the team take turns to answer some burning questions from fans. One of them comes from user NasserMX who asks whether Five Nights at Freddy's will ever make its way to Dead by Daylight.
https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/16cjy36/comment/jzjqfmy/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3
While the answer isn't a definitive yes or no, Behaviour's own Senior Creative Director, Dave Richard, says to "never say never!" Not much can be read from this statement, but a few Reddit users posting below seem excited about the possibility of the two franchises coming together.
Imagine running away from The Puppet
Since time immemorial (well...seven years ago), Dead by Daylight has made a name for itself with numerous crossovers. We've seen Silent Hill's Pyramid Head, Freddy Krueger, Bill from Left 4 Dead, Resident Evil 3's Nemesis, and more horror villains make an appearance.
We obviously don't know whether the team will bring the creepy animatronics from Five Nights at Freddy's over. However, it does sound like the studio is keen on the idea. The smash hit spooky series is still going, though it's not as popular as it once was. A film adaptation of FNaF is currently in the pipeline and due to release October 27.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I didn't need to play much of Mario Kart Tour to find out it's not for me: but even if you're still enjoying it, the race is coming to an end in the near future. According to a new in-game notification straight from Nintendo (via OatmealDome), new content for Mario Kart Tour will cease to come out from October 4, 2023 onward.
Here's the full wording from Nintendo:
"From 10/04/2023 (Wed) on, tours will consist of content from tours that have appeared before. Note: No new courses, drivers, karts, or gliders will be added following the Battle Tour starting 10/04/2023 (Wed). We hope you continue to enjoy playing Mario Kart Tour."

Well, that's pretty definitive! I love how Nintendo clarified "courses, drivers, karts, or gliders" just to let folks know that there is no hope of new content coming to the game post-October. This is just a few weeks following the fourth anniversary of the game's release on September 25, 2019.
Mario Kart 8 Deluxe will carry on the legacy of Mario Kart Tour's few bright spots
Funnily enough, a good chunk of the game's courses have already been ported over to Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, so even when the microtransaction-filled game goes offline entirely, its legacy will still live on in some form. Even though it kicked off years ago, it's still so weird to see Nintendo getting into the mobile game with gacha fodder and loot boxes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There was a time back in my school days when cardgames were all the rage. Everybody had a deck of playing cards in their pocket for cheeky 15 minute rounds of Texas Hold 'Em between lessons, with Milky Way segments and Niknaks wagered in place of chips. Yes, I'm aware I'm starting to sound like Grandpa Simpson, and no, this wasn't from some murky era before the invention of videogames. It was the heyday of the Gameboy Advance! I'm not sure what we were thinking. But two things: 1) decks of playing cards are cheaper than game consoles, and 2) part of the fun, possibly, was that nobody really knew how to play the ostensibly well-known cardgames we were playing.
With the benefit of hindsight, I suspect there may have been creative liberties taken with the rules at times. I knew hair-pulling wasn't a legal move in professional poker. Anyway, I'm reminded of all this by Dungeons & Degenerate Gamblers, a warped and mildly satirical, 90s-styled take on Blackjack from Purple Moss Collectors.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Zero to hero.
Though Capcom hasn’t necessarily abandoned the Mega Man brand as a whole, it’s indisputably reduced how often it produces new games in that celebrated franchise. For example, it’s been 19 years since the last new Mega Man X release (and let’s be real, X8 was a rough entry to end on), but that series now lives on in the efforts of its fans. A few years ago, Battery Staple Games released 20XX, a cute roguelite take on Mega Man gameplay, and now it’s followed up that effort with 30XX. It isn’t without issues, but we’re happy to report that 30XX feels like an overall improvement over its predecessor, and stands as a worthy homage to a beloved series.
Gameplay in 30XX follows the template of classic Mega Man X. You run ‘n’ gun through eight themed levels capped off with a tough boss fight, collecting new weapons or abilities each time you beat another boss, then challenge some extra tough final stages. The gimmick here, however, is that 30XX is structured like a roguelite, so each stage is different each run and there are myriad upgrades you can collect along the way to help even the odds a little bit. There are two playable characters, named Ace and Nina, and they take after Zero and X, respectively. Both have their pros and cons, though we generally preferred Nina’s ranged gameplay over Ace’s sword-swinging skills.

If you are after a dose of retro arcade simplicity, then you might want to check out Raindrop Sprinters, a fixed-screen action game that snuck its way onto the Switch eShop last week.
The title comes from solo developer Shuhei Miyazawa (Room_909) and publisher Mediascape and sees you attempting to guide a cat across a series of passages while avoiding the falling rain. It's a simple premise with a classic visual style (the game is even playable in the Switch's oft-underused Tate Mode) but there seems to be a good level of reward to be had here, with riskier manoeuvres resulting in more points.

There's also the brand-new appearance of Fae Farm, which makes its debut in the charts at number 9.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There was plenty of excitement when a S.T.A.L.K.E.R. sequel was announced by GSC Game World. Nobody could have predicted just how tumultuous the development cycle would be. The game has faced numerous delays due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine which forced the team to quickly relocate from Kyiv to Prague.
This was far from the end of their problems, as they would also suffer cyber attacks originating from Russia. Because of all these hurdles, the game's release date has shifted to 2024. It appears that a new kind of problem has appeared, this time in the form of fire.
It was originally reported by the Czech publication Vortex on September 8 that GSC Game World had suffered a fire in their offices. According to PC Gamer, nobody was hurt in the fire, and a GSC representative has confirmed that the incident is under investigation.
[caption id="attachment_403508" align="alignnone" width="640"] Image via GSC Game World.[/caption]
Battered but not beaten
In its official Discord server, the studio confirmed a few more details about the fire, including that although the fire was quickly put out, an office floor will need full restoration. Despite the setback, developers remain intent on releasing S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2, and their confidence is motivated by the fact that they've "dealt with worse than that before."
It's certainly a true statement, as despite escaping a warzone, developers have been able to present a playable demo at this year's Gamescom. Although GSC Game World has attempted to defend the demo's "imperfect" state, the reception to it has been relatively good.

From the combat's blistering pace to the depth of customization, this is undoubtedly one of the best mech games in a long time. It also has a solid narrative about fighting against the odds for your beliefs and survival.
The delivery is more direct than most works coming out of FromSoftware since its games often keep the surface narrative light. Armored Core has always been this way, even if the latest entry is more dialogue-focused than its predecessors.
Also like what came before, Armored Core 6's ending come from branching paths depending on missions chosen at key points. It offers two endings on a first playthrough, with a third one unlocked after finishing the ga…]]></summary>

That's for good reason, too, as Starfield is currently missing a crucial feature that all Bethesda Game Studios RPGS eventually receive: Creation Kit support. Until Creation Kit 2 - built specifically for Starfield's Creation Engine 2 - comes out, modders won't be able to easily add new weapons, customizations, and other assorted goodies into the game, but the good news is that it's bound to happen relatively soon!

On the flip side, there are even more anime based on games — the recently released Nier Automata adaptation, Persona 5: The Animation, and Doll’s/Girl’s Frontline.
It’s a fool’s errand to say the two media are not connected. But what if we were given an infinite budget and told to name ten characters from anime who would receive their own game?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Roblox has a firm grip on the gaming world thanks to a few key elements that have helped it attract millions of players. For instance, it's a small game that isn't going to tax even the most dated PCs. Furthermore, it also has strong social elements, allowing players from around the world to use it as a virtual hangout spot.
A recent blog post from Roblox outlined some of the revelations from the Roblox Developers Conference (RDC) which took place in San Francisco. Developers plan to continue making Roblox one of the best places for friends to communicate and play together. The game will also be expanding its reach when it finally launches on PS4 and PS5 in October.
This is a long-awaited port, as Roblox has conspicuously not been available in the Nintendo and PlayStation ecosystems despite its popularity. Currently, the game supports crossplay, though it hasn't been confirmed yet whether the PlayStation ports will also have crossplay capabilities.
[caption id="attachment_374524" align="alignnone" width="640"] Image via Roblox Corporation[/caption]
What to expect from Roblox in 2023 and beyond
Roblox will be making things a little easier for creators and giving them more freedom. New mesh and texture APIs will be added, allowing you to edit your avatar and avatar items such as clothes within an experience. Developers also intend to craft tools that enable users to create avatars from text inputs.
Later this year, Roblox Connect will also launch. In a bid to further expand the game's available features, Roblox Connect will let you call other players and display your facial expressions through your avatars, and all that's needed is your device's camera.
Roblox will also be coming to Meta Quest. The open beta has already been released, and in the first five days, it was downloaded over a million times. It comes just in time for the Quest 3 which is scheduled to launch later this year.

ArsTechnica reported on a recent consent judgment between Bungie and teenage cheater Luca Leone, wherein both parties agreed to the aforementioned court ruling. Bungie claimed that Leone's leveraging of cheat software constitutes Destiny 2 copyright infringement via graphical overlays and injected code, and the court has provided an assessment that this does, indeed, make for "unauthorized derivative work."
Following the court ruling, Leone is now officially and legally prohibited from "obtaining, downloading, copying, playing, streaming, or otherwise interacting with Bungie's games" ever again. Leone has also been ordered…]]></summary>

It's the weekend and that can mean only one thing — yes, it's time for another edition of Box Art Brawl!
Before we dive into this week's contestants, let's take a look at how things played out last time. Celebrating the release of Sabotage's excellent RPG Sea of Stars, we took a look at the cover variants from around the world, with you picking the winner. This one was a little closer than we would have expected (then again, both covers are really rather stunning), but it was the lesser-known Japanese box art that secured the win with 53% of the vote compared to Europe and North America's 47%.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[AMD's Radeon RX 6800 and 6800 XT graphics cards have proven surprisingly popular even into 2023, as new price drops (and relatively modest gen-on-gen performance increases for newer models) has left them as competitive options in terms of value for money. 
Today we've got a deal on the RX 6800 non-XT, with an MSI model going for just under $400 at Newegg. That's a $70 reduction from its usual price and $20 cheaper than the cheapest RX 6800 model on Amazon. That's an awesome deal for a strong 1440p graphics card that comes with a copy of Starfield Premium Edition (which includes the Shattered Space story expansion, a digital art book, the game's OST and a few weapon/suit skins on top of the base game).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Only Up!, the brutally difficult platformer that took Twitch by storm earlier this year, has been voluntarily removed from Steam by its creator.
Only Up! was created by SCKR Games, a studio consisting of just one person known as Indiesolodev. In a final update on Steam, they state that the game has been a source of stress over the past several months, and they now want to put the game behind them.
Indiesolodev will take the time off to grow as a developer, and they shared plans for a new game in the works called Kith.
“‘Kith’ - it will be a new experience and a new concept with realism, a completely different genre and setting, and the emphasis is on cinematography. This time I hope the project will be created by a small team. This is a challenging project on which I want to significantly improve my skills in game design.”

This is not the first time Only Up! was removed from Steam. It was taken down briefly back in late June amidst controversy regarding stolen assets. Indiesolodev quickly removed the problematic assets, and the updated game was back on Steam in a matter of days.
There has also been pushback to NFT artwork being featured on some assets in what many players saw as an advertisement for NFTs.
Despite the controversy and janky controls, Only Up! was quite popular on Twitch for a time, attracting the attention of let’s players and speedrunners. With the sudden increase in scrutiny, it’s no wonder the developer felt stressed. 
I’m glad Indiesolodev is taking some time for themselves. Hopefully, with the support of a team behind them, the development of Kith goes much more smoothly.

I also know that its video game adaptation, released in 1995 for the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive, was a 16-bit platformer with a similar appeal to other Disney games of the period like Aladdin and The Lion King.

Both those games were re-released in 2021, and now it's Gargoyles' turn. There's a first trailer for Gargoyles Remastered below.

Your avatar will show up on the screen singing alongside you. Publisher Plaion is packaging pop hits like Lizzo's "About Damn Time" and BTS' "Dynamite" into this year's editions. The game will feature "all-time" classics in the songlist, too.
Plaion and developer Voxler plan a "full-fledged" story (career) mode for this year's iteration that will "keep [us] rocking for hours and hours" that will take us from "amateur singing lessons to absolute stardom." The publisher says you'll "master songs and specific challenges while you meet unforgettable characters on your way to fame."

One snuck by the overseer. The other talked to them. As is often the case with me, I shot first and apologized afterward.
Bethesda’s open-world games seem to swing between spectacular introductions or less inspired ones. Morrowind had you fill out paperwork before kicking you out into the world so you could watch a hapless mage plummet from the sky. Daggerfall drops you into a very beginner-unfriendly dungeon. Fallout 4 leaves you to witness the end of the world. Then there's Starfield.
Starfield asks you to look at some rocks. Then it kicks you into one of the greyest vistas we’ve seen since the late aughts, just to prep you for more tutorials.

At the same time, it’s a new chapter in a long legacy that surrounds the interplay between the original tabletop RPG and the video gaming hobby.

When I was a kid growing up in the ‘80s, playing D&D was not something you would readily admit to. Beyond the open ridicule you might face from your peers, it had a genuine chance to get you barred from some of your friends’ homes. No joke.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Epic Games chief creative officer Donald Mustard is retiring this month after seven years with the company. He announced this today on Twitter, stating that after working in the games industry for nearly 25 years, he is retiring to spend time with his wife and family. 
Most notably, Mustard served as the head of Fortnite, responsible for leading its storytelling and creative decision-making behind the game as a battle royale. Epic Games has not announced who will be taking over the role after Mustard retires, nor has it specified what the future of Fortnite looks like, although hundreds are working on it, and things will likely continue as usual. 
Here’s what Mustard posted on Twitter:
After an incredible adventure, I will be retiring from my role as Chief Creative Officer at Epic this month.

        <updated>2023-09-08T17:03:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stray proved to be an unlikely phenomenon when it was released last July, and now the little kitty and its robotic pals are heading to the big screen. Publisher Annapurna has announced plans to develop an animated movie based on the hit indie game.
Per Entertainment Weekly, Annapurna Animation, the company's new animated film division, is following up its debut feature, Nimona, with a film adaptation of the 2022 adventure game. It will be the first game in Annapurna Interactive’s roster of titles to get the cinematic treatment, and, according to the publisher, it won’t be the last. Annapurna has not revealed a director, cast, or release window for the Stray film. Annapurna Animation is led by former Disney Animation executives Robert Baird and Andrew Millstein. 
"This is a game that's all about what makes us human, and there are no humans in it," Baird tells EW. "It's a buddy comedy about a cat and a robot, and there's such a hilarious dynamic. So, there's comedy inherent in this, but there's not one human being in this movie. I think it's one of the reasons why the game was incredibly popular, that you are seeing the world through the point of view of an adorable cat. How did they pull that off, and how are we going to pull that off in the movie? We will, even though sometimes it feels impossible, but we know that's the essence of the game and the key to telling the story."
Stray was developed by French studio BlueTwelve. Taking place in a post-apocalyptic Earth devoid of humans, players control a cat who gets separated from its friends and sets out to find them. The cat's journey takes it through cities occupied by sentient robots, which it befriends along the way, namely a flying drone named B-12. Stray was among the most celebrated games of last year, winning Best Debut Indie at the Game Awards, and made its way to Xbox last month. You can read our review of Stray here.

According to Xbox Wire, the event will feature “progress updates from Xbox and Bethesda Softworks and see a creatively diverse collection of games from creators predominantly located in Japan and across Asia.” The event will also reveal new titles for Xbox Game Pass.
The most likely game to appear is Final Fantasy XIV, which is heading to Xbox next spring ahead of its upcoming Dawntrail expansion. Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth, which last popped up during this summer's Xbox Games Showcase, could also reappear. Of course, there are plenty of big Japanse developed titles incoming that could get a spotlight, and it's always interesting to see what Asian companies and titles it courts each year. 
Tokyo Game Show runs from September 21 to 24. Publishers like Capcom, Atlus, Sega, Koei Tecmo, and Square Enix, among others, will air dedicated livestreams throughout the event.]]></summary>

It wasn't entirely clear what OU was going to be at that point, other than a sort-of-puzzle game about an amnesiac boy who'd found himself in a fantastical world of picturebook pages, and even when Alicia Haddick played it for herself at Bitsummit proper the following year, OU still had a strong, impenetrable sense of ambiguity about it.  
But its striking art and rustic guitar soundtrack have stuck in my mind ever since, and finally, OU is now out in the wild. I've only played about two hours of it so far, but it's clear there's still a lot more to discover within its dreamy little vignettes. It's one of those games that's designed to be played multiple times to get the full extent of the story, and I've just hit the first of those Nier Automata-esque restarts. Honestly, I'm not quite sure what to think of it yet, but one thing is certain: I can't get it out of my head.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Announced earlier this year at Summer Game Fest, Islands Of Insight is, somehow, both an open world multiplayer game, and a puzzle game - something akin to The Witness but in a fantasy world you share with other players. There are serene floating islands, wide open flying and a varied chocolate box of puzzles. Publisher Behaviour Interactive (from Dead By Daylight fame) have now announced a free open playtest, available to everyone from now until September 21st. As lovely as the game looks, I’m excited to try Islands Of Insight for myself.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Although most of my favourite films are tragedies, games with a grim and heavy premise don't often appeal to me as much as you'd think. I wasn't quite expecting to enjoy The Man Came Around, then, as it's about a group of desperate people trying to cross the border to escape their authoritarian government. In Winter, no less.
It's actually rather light in practice, although not in a flippant or trivialising way. The message is clearly that these things are serious and our sympathies should be, well, basic concern for the wellbeing of other people. But it's not as miserable to play as games with such serious themes often are. The premise is serious, but the act of playing it is not. I'd call it "diverting" rather than "entertaining", but the bottom line is there's a good afternoon or two in there for you.

Scrolling through social media channels, you’ll find that players have hammered away at their own unique designs while also creatively remaking other iconic vessels from Mass Effect, Star Wars, Halo and, of course, our friend Thomas The Tank Engine. There’s also been a shocking lack of, uhm, male organ-shaped spacecraft which makes putting this post together much less hard. But for now, onward! Let’s admire some cool ships.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Confession time: if you've been keeping up to date with Colossal Order's feature highlight video series for Cities: Skylines 2 over the last couple of months, you're probably not going to learn a huge amount from my experience of playing it at Gamescom a couple of weeks ago. I spent most of my hour-long demo session steadily working my way through its extensive tutorial, as I have not, in fact, played Cities: Skylines before now - although I can at least confirm that its tutorial is very newbie-friendly, and that I now feel more prepared to give it a go properly when it comes out in full on October 24th.
But the thing that really impressed me was just the sheer scope of its playable spaces. We've known since the end of July that its maps are roughly 5x bigger than those in the first game, and when I saw Colossal Order's Maps & Themes video, I thought, 'Yes, those sure look enormous!' But actually seeing them in person really put things into perspective for me, especially when I tried zooming the camera out and it just kept going and going and going and…

Since the reveal of Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 in 2021, we’ve known Venom is a major villain in the game. And while that reveal teased what many thought to be Kraven the Hunter, it wasn’t confirmed to be him until later. Since then, we’ve learned that the game shares a tone with Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back and that Peter Parker will get a Venom Symbiote suit.

Even among its astronomical system requirements, an inflexible demand for solid state storage seemed like a stretch; after all, Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart runs mostly fine on a hard drive, and in a previous life that game was employed as a cheerleader for the PS5’s SSD. Starfield would probably just have rubbish load times or texture pop-in or something, and all would be revealed once I could try it on mechanical storage. Which I now have.
So, can you play Starfield on an HDD? No. It’s bloody awful.

Since Lars Sundström, aka lman, joined our team as the iOS porter, we have made significant progress. Thus, you no longer need to compile ScummVM yourself in order to add it to your iOS or iPadOS device. 
If you want to help by testing this version, just follow this Testflight link and enroll yourself in the test program. This may require installing Apple’s Testflight app. You can find instructions on how to install games and how to play them on our documentation portal.
We truly appreciate your feedback. You can share your thoughts with the Testflight feedback feature, where you can attach screenshots and post detailed descriptions. Alternatively, you can use our bugtracker, e-mail us at ios@scummvm.org, or post on our Discord Server. Your help will let us eventually add ScummVM to the App Store.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some would say the best way to wind down after a rough day down the Content Reactors isn’t to play a grotty occult horror game, but I caught a trailer for Tenebris Somnia earlier, and couldn’t help myself. In this foetid offering from Argentinian devs Andrés Borghi and Tobías Rusjan of Saibot Studios, you play a young woman, Julia, who is visiting her film-maker ex-boyfriend to drop off their old apartment key. Julia’s having a hard time getting over the break-up, but she’s clearly doing better than her ex: his apartment is full of broken glass, anomalous red gloop and creepy occult books. 


The game’s twist is that it’s two visual styles thrust into the same frame. On the one hand, you'll explore an 8-bit world of unpleasantly bright colours, finding and combining objects adventure-game-style. I say adventure-game-style, because this is a bit more energetic than most adventure games – you can equip and swing a wrench, and there’s a run button. On the other hand, well. Click the headline to find out, if you dare. Yes, this is me trying to do a jumpscare. Brace yourself! (It's just occurred to me, 24 hours too late, that the above joke only makes sense if you're viewing our Latest feed. Everybody else, erm - scroll down?)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mortal Kombat co-creator Ed Boon made an unexpected appearance on the popular interview show Hot Ones to talk about Mortal Kombat 1 and the series as a whole. As Boon sweats through increasingly spicy wings, we also get a glimpse at the previously announced Jean-Claude Van Damme skin for Johnny Cage. 
For the unfamiliar, Hot Ones is a 1-on-1 interview show in which celebrity guests are asked questions while devouring wings that get gradually spicier as the interview progresses (usually to humorous results). Boon’s discussion delves into his entry into the game industry, Netherrealm's decision-making process when selecting cross-over fighters, the studio's approach to storytelling, and other topics. Boon is one of, if not the first, video game developer to appear on the show, and watching him share his fighting game knowledge while simultaneously fighting for his life is an entertaining treat. 


During the discussion, we get the first clip of Johnny Cage's Jean-Claude Van Damme character skin, which you can see in the photos below. It will be purchasable in the Kombat pack that will be included in the Premium/Kollector's editions of the game. 

Mortal Kombat 1 launches on September 19 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC. For the latest roster reveals, check out trailers for Nitara, Sindel/General Shao, Ashrah/Havik, and Smoke/Rain.]]></summary>

A new trailer revealed the game’s new presentation and an October release date.
Gargoyles Remastered takes the 1995 game and repaints it with a coat of new enhanced visuals more faithful to the series (and you can instantly toggle between the new look and the classic 16-bit graphics). It also includes the usual bells and whistles for remastered Disney games, such as an instant rewind, wide-screen presentation, and achievements. The original soundtrack has also been remastered. Check out the game's first trailer below. 


If you’re a Gargoyles fan looking to fight evil as Goliath and his friends again, you can pick up Gargoyles Remastered on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on October 19.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last month, Nintendo revealed longtime Mario voice actor Charles Martinet will no longer voice the character. The company stopped short of revealing who is taking over the role, although it did say we’d find out in the upcoming release of Super Mario Bros. Wonder, which does not feature Martinet as Mario. 
Now, Nintendo has released a new video featuring Martinet and Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto discussing their history together, the role of Mario, and Martinet’s new role, Mario Ambassador. 
You can watch the video in full below, but we’ve transcribed most of it for your reading as well:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[E3 2023 was canceled back in March, and PAX organizer ReedPop was in charge of organizing the event, the first of a multi-year contract. However, E3's overseer the ESA has announced this partnership will not continue.
According to GameIndustry.biz, the ESA and ReedPop have come to a mutual decision to part ways. On top of that, E3 2024, which is still planned to take place, will not be held at its traditional venue, the Los Angeles Convention Center. This had been previously reported by the city itself. There’s no word on where E3 will be held, but the site reports that the ESA is also looking to completely reinvent the show in 2025. 
“We appreciate ReedPop’s partnership over the past 14 months and support their ongoing efforts to bring industry and fans together through their various events,” said ESA president and CEO Stanley Pierre-Louis in a statement to GameIndustry.biz. “While the reach of E3 remains unmatched in our industry, we are continuing to explore how we can evolve it to best serve the video game industry and are evaluating every aspect of the event, from format to location. We are committed to our role as a convenor for the industry and look forward to sharing news about E3 in the coming months.”
ReedPop had been tasked with revamping this year’s ill-fated E3 after the show had collapsed over the last few years due to the pandemic and waning interest from publishers/developers. The 2023 edition fell through after Nintendo, Sony, and Microsoft declined to attend alongside publishers such as Ubisoft and Sega. The last in-person E3 was in 2019, and outside of the online-only 2021 event, every subsequent E3 has been completely canceled. Geoff Keighley's Summer Game Fest has filled the void since then.

Either way, I’ve recently developed an intense appreciation for teeny, tiny microgames, to the point where I’ve essentially been begging in the RPS Slack channel for recommendations. Just one more Steam link and I’ll be fine, promise.
And I don’t mean short games in the seven- or eight-hour sense. Not even film-length games like Portal or Jazzpunk. No, I seek to gorge on the slightest sub-hour canapés, games in which you can see and do everything in one or hour or less. "Irresponsibly large"? Another time, Mister Starfield, I crave something irrevocably small.

While rumors continue to swirl about what the Switch successor could be and when it might be released, new reports from Eurogamer and Video Games Chronicle say the company showed it to developers behind closed doors at Gamescom last month. 
Eurogamer says its sources say Nintendo showed partners tech demos designed to demonstrate how well the Switch successor runs. Specifically, one of the demos shown was reportedly a “souped-up version” of the Switch launch title, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. Eurogame…]]></summary>

As billionaire jebends plot to establish their own corporate fiefdoms amongst the stars, our descendents' potential spacelives are looking as miserable as collecting 5 spacewolf livers. But I find some hope in spaceship salvage sim Hardspace: Shipbreaker, both in the overt plot about unionisation and in the small satisfaction of doing a job well. Head down, shut up, and focus on dismantling this spaceship carefully and efficiently. It's an attitude that won't save the world but can get you through one more day, and sometimes that's enough.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I finished Part 1 of my perverse effort to play Starfield entirely as a space sim, I was both terrified and tantalised. A quick reminder of the rules: I can only acquire new ships by commandeering them, with no planetary landings permitted, which also means that I can't just shuffle between ships at whim after adding them to my hangar. It's possible the game contains an orbital shipyard of some kind - if you've found one, don't spoil! - but at the time of writing, any vessel I abandon is essentially gone for good. 


My first trophy as greenhorn orbital bandit Mary Read was a UC Transpo, which isn't so much a spaceship as a shoebox with toilet roll tubes and detergent bottles glued to the outside, its ordnance limited to a single laser. I began my second leg confidently expecting to spend many hours in this Fisher Price starmobile, vainly searching for a wounded battlecruiser or an abandoned solar yacht or some other, more capable vessel accessible to a space pirate of extremely modest means. This is going to be Jalopy: Galactic Edition, I said to myself. Imagine my shock (and slight disappointment) when I jumped to the very next planet and proceeded to comprehensively ding over a Crimson Fleet Spectre.

In truth, I was surprised (and somewhat saddened) by some of the comments we received around our Baldur's Gate 3 coverage. If you missed them, they were mostly in the vein of saying our increased volume of BG3-related posts felt like "spam", harking back to when we (and the internet at large) all went similarly bananas over Elden Ring last year. I know it can sometimes seem like writing about these games - particularly on RPS - feels like we're somehow neglecting everything else going on in PC gaming. But the truth is a little more complicated than that, so I wanted to take some time to talk a bit about this in this month's Letter From The Editor, because there are a number of reasons why this happens - and will probably continue to happen more generally as websites fight for survival.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sometimes, a game sits at such a cross section of my interests that it almost feels made specifically for me. In the case of Affogato, it’s three of my favourite types of games mashed together: it’s Coffee Talk by way of Persona by way of any card-based tower defence game – only here it’s sort of "reverse tower defence", as the game's Steam page is keen to point out. It's your own card units that are the ones moving along pre-defined tracks wreaking havoc on stationary enemies, not the other way around. Maybe tower assault would be a better term, but that's by the by. Served with a dollop of anime froth on the top, Affogato should be my exact cuppa joe. But despite its intriguing ingredients, I wouldn't say it's been wholly successful in slooshing them all together.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Oft' am I struck by the fact that video game homes belonging to characters in the depths of despair are nicer that all of the homes I've lived in myself. Granted, I'm a thirty-something in a country with a years-long housing crisis, so even the Baker House in Resident Evil 7 is of "I think I could just about afford that one day" status. But it comes to something when a 70s depresso-capsule at the bottom of the sea has more square footage and storage space than I do.
Under The Waves (which got patched today, and not before time because I've had one fatal error crash per play session since it came out last week so far) is about a deep sea diver called Stan, who is living and working at the bottom of a big wet metaphor for grief. You will know this because a) its Steam page says this up front, and b) it's not super subtle (this game is published by Quantic Dream). But, as newsman Edwin pointed out to me today, when was the last time the sea wasn't a metaphor for grief? It's never a metaphor for enjoying a nice raspberry ripple ice cream. And despite Stan making reference to "what [he's] been through" half an hour in, I think it does a great job with its chthonic sadness. You float about in your tiny little sub in a great misty darkness, listen to the extremely melancholy music, and you start thinking about sad stuff in your own life. But you get into Stan's capsule living area and you think "this guy has a carpet and a book nook, what the hell?"

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I like to think that I'm above the lure of Cool Violent Thing in Videogame these days, but when I see a lanky robot parry a nuclear shockwave with a katana as though swatting a wasp, I find myself Enthused.
The videogame in question is Pyrolith's V.A. Proxy, which I've had my eye on for a while, on account of it being inspired by Nier: Automata and Devil May Cry, with a landscape of megastructures and bruised and rusty art direction that calls to mind The Signal from Tölva. In this moody open world action game, you play one of three robots who awaken to find their memories gone, and promptly set out in search of their creator. It'd be an eye-catcher even without the atomic parry, which you can witness for yourself in the embedded clip below.

Are they just collections of sealed-off maps that fake the presence of landmarks such as named cities beyond their invisible boundaries? I just don't even know any more, but Starfield mod creators are looking into it. One intrepid soul, Draspian, has tinkered with the code to disable said invisible boundaries, and in the process, revealed that planetary maps do, in fact, join together, though as you might be expecting, Starfield doesn't take kindly to being treated this way.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mortal Kombat 1’s roster already has a few returning names from the series’ 3D era in the forms of Ashrah and Havik, and another long-lost favorite joins the fight. Nitara is making her long-awaited return, and it’s such a big homecoming that NetherRealm has enlisted actress Megan Fox to voice her.
Nitara is a vampire that made her debut in 2002’s Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance. She’s only been playable in a couple of entries, had a small cameo in Mortal Kombat 11, and appeared in the 2021 Mortal Kombat film. Despite having only a few appearances to her name, she’s endured as favorite among fans who grew up with the 2000s era, and she looks as deadly as ever in MK 1. 
Megan Fox brings Nitara to life, and you can get a sample of her performance in the trailer below. “I grew up playing Mortal Kombat and I can’t believe that I’m voicing a character in the new game," Fox says in a press release. "It’s an honor to be a part of one of the greatest video game legacies of all time.” Given that Ronda Rousey voiced Sonya Blade in MK 11, it’s not surprising to see NetherRealm rope in another celebrity to perform one of its kombatants. 


Mortal Kombat 1 launches on September 19 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC. Check out our latest hands-on impressions of its Invasions and Story Mode here. Be sure to also watch the game's most recent trailer from Gamescom 2023.]]></summary>

But the latter was the highlight of my experience. 
I completed three contracts during my hands-on time, each at different levels of progression for protagonist Basim Ibn Is’haq. Contracts are essentially mini-missions that task you with eliminating a target, obtaining an item, or doing something like moving a boat to a specified location.

It's the company's first new IP in almost 30 years (a claim that contains in it an inherent threat for Starfield 2), and though Bethesda has copied some of their own homework for some themes and factions, Starfield is indeed a spacefaring adventure of epic scale and sometimes surprising beauty. It's this scale that makes Starfield feel unfortunately small and empty, a place that still has those fun little Bethesda side quests that escalate into something huge and absurd, but that can also swallow them whole in its cold, star-scattered grandeur.

A na scheduleru systému je, aby úlohy rozhazoval jádrům pokud možno optimálně, tedy například i v situacích, kdy je sice nejlepší jádro CPU volné, ale úloha běží na jiném CCX modulu v jiném segmentu L3 cache a její přesun tam a zpět by byl horší než nechat úlohu doběhnout na jiném, ale bližším CPU jádru, případně existuje vhodnější CPU jádro z hlediska parametrů frekvence a napětí pro danou frekvenci.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the grim darkness of the far future, the galaxy is your oyster. Or at least it will be, once you've played 100 hours of Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader, an RPG from Pathfinder developer Owlcat in which you can buy planets, configure your genocidal Dark Eldar friend to strike ten times a turn, and gaze on ruefully as a demon explodes out of your Psyker's head. 


An immediate and shameful disclaimer: I can't match Nic Reuben's deep knowledge of the 40K tabletop universe, which saw him ruminating upon the mysteries of the Koronus Expanse back in 2022, while holding Owlcat's feet to the fire over the absence of space dwarves. The nearest I got to playing 40K as a lad was its Battlefleet Gothic spin-off (which none of my friends were interested in, so when I say "playing", I mean that I sat in a room staring glumly at some unpainted Lunar-class Cruisers while other kids went out and climbed trees). The framing I'm working with instead, based on an hour of hands-off Rogue Trader gameplay, is that it's sort of Warhammer Mass Effect, but with XCOM-style turn- and grid-based combat, and while there are opportunities to be a compassionate hero, you fundamentally only have the option of playing Renegade. Let's dig in!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The animated film Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem has garnered critical acclaim since its release in theaters last month. As fans know, the best way to follow up a good TMNT project is to make a video game out of it, and that’s exactly what's happening next year. 
Publisher Outright Games, along with Paramount and Nickelodeon, have announced a new untitled TMNT game in development set within the Mutant Mayhem universe. It will feature the same striking visual design and follows a new story set months after the movie's events. There’s no word yet on if the film’s ensemble cast will reprise their roles.
In terms of gameplay, a press release only hints that the project involves “combining energetic ninja teamwork gameplay with a humorous narrative, players will take control of the Turtles as they interact with a host of memorable characters from the franchise and fight to save this stylized take on New York City from a new mutant threat.” Outright Games has experience working on games based on kid-friendly licenses, making titles based on Star Trek: Prodigy, How to Train Your Dragon, Paw Patrol, and Peppa Pig. 
The TMNT: Mutant Mayhem game is targeting PC and consoles. It’s the latest project in what’s been quite a renaissance for the Turtles, especially in video games. The resurgence kicked off with last year’s well-received TMNT: Shredder’s Revenge, which recently got a big new expansion. The Cowabunga Collection bundled nearly every classic TMNT game into one package for a modern audience. A single-player action game based on the beloved TMNT: The Last Ronin graphic novel is also in the works.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Publisher Tilting Point has revealed Cypher 007, a new top-down action game starring James Bond, coming to Apple Arcade on iOS devices later this month. It launches on September 29 and takes players into "The Mind Trap." 
Because it's an Apple Arcade game, it will require a subscription. But after subscribing, the game is technically free-to-play and will feature zero microtransactions, like all Apple Arcade games. In it, you'll be able to unlock new gadgets and weapons, build resources, collect outfits and new character models from across the franchise, and more. 
Check out the Cypher 007 teaser trailer for yourself below: 


"The criminal mastermind Blofeld and head of Spectre has once again hatched a plan to sabotage his archenemy James Bond," the game's description reads. "This time, he has utilized brainwashing techniques known as 'The Mind Trap,' holding Bond captive in a mental prison in an attempt to turn him into the ultimate double agent. Play as Agent 007 on his most challenging missions yet – escape the Mind Trap, defeat Blofeld, and put an end to the Cypher program." 
Because it's a 007 game, you'll run into other MI6 operatives like Q, M, and Moneypenny, all while completing levels that increase in difficulty as you progress. You can compete against other players, too. 

Cypher 007 hits Apple Arcade later this month on September 29.]]></summary>

I compare this project, which seemed pretty much doomed at the time, with the globe-straddling free-to-play battle royale/concert venue/art gallery/Olympic sport/all-swallowing multiverse Fortnite has become, and I feel extremely old. My sense of time's crushing burden is not alleviated for learning that Epic are staffing up for work on "a new experience in the Fortnite ecosystem", which sounds a lot like a Fortnite open worlder.

Despite that success, though, it seems the company is moving on from this Hyrule as Zelda producer Eiji Aonuma has revealed there will be no DLC for the game. 
That’s what he told Japanese magazine Famitsu in a new interview, as translated by Genki_JPN on Twitter. Based on his comments, the team behind TOTK might be moving on to a new Zelda game in a new Hyrule, too. 


“We have no plans to release additional content this time, but that is because we feel like we have done all we can do to create play in that world,” Aonuma told Famitsu, according to Genki. “This …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lightyear Frontier is not the kind of game that fits neatly into a 30-minute Gamescom demo. There's so much to see and do in this laidback farming mech sim that by the time my demo ends, I barely feel like I've scratched the surface of it (and that's even with the assistance of some handy secret dev cheats to show me some of the structures and features they've got planned later on in the game). Rather, this is a game that's designed to unfurl slowly, bit by bit, over the course of several hours, and before we begin, developer Frame Break's CEO Joakim Hedström tells me they've shortened the game's opening sequence for this particular demo, just so they can get players right into the thick of things as quickly as possible. 
But even on this whistlestop tour, there's plenty to dig into and delight in here - not least its gloriously bright and inviting colour palette (take that, Todd). I got to sample its farming, its wonderfully weighty mech exploration, and even indulge in a little bit of, well, powerwashing. Yep, PowerWash Simulator's influence was well and truly felt at this year's Gamescom, and I'm so very here for it.

And if you were planning to get it through PC Game Pass, that's another issue, as Game Pass games are locked down behind the fully Deck-incompatible Universal Windows Platform system. If the wonder of space depends on the it being a borderless infinity realm of endless possibilities, nobody told Microsoft.
There is a way, however, to sidestep both problems. Xbox Cloud Gaming will let you play Starfield on the Steam Deck at a steady (enough) 30fps, by streaming the game from Microsoft's cloud network direct to your screen - no Proton GE or Lutris launcher required. It still takes some setting up, but luckily, you’ve already clicked onto a step-by-step guide on how to do it.

A large portion of '90s kids look back on Rugrats with great fondness. As one of the defining cartoons of both the decade and the network of Nickelodeon, Rugrats spawned its fair share of licensed video games, but last week's announcement of a new one still came as a shock. That game, Rugrats: Adventures in Gameland, doesn't just feature retro sensibilities – it's an actual all-new retro game built in 2023. Though the first Rugrats video game didn't release until the late '90s, Rugrats: Adventures in Gameland gives you the full retro experience, paying homage…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ring the bell, everybody, it's time for another round of game developers telling players that they don't really understand what a "game engine" is. The spark this time is little-known science fiction adventure Starfield, which I believe we've reported on before. The game has a few obvious foibles - in my experience as a space pirate, NPCs sometimes struggle to navigate their surroundings, and then there are those stark disconnects between planetary surfaces and orbital space. Hiccups such as these have led a few players to wonder whether the game might work better using different technology, and in particular, the newer versions of Epic's ubiquitous Unreal Engine. Isn't Bethesda's proprietary Creation Engine, which the company have been updating since 2011, getting a little long in the tooth?
You'll find a lot of the discussion below this post from Digital Foundry boffin John Linneman on Twxter, which has attracted both gloating PlayStation fans (remember, Starfield is Xbox-only in console land) and a number of thoughtful replies from some fairly senior game developers. This conversation goes back a fair way, of course - people have been ragging on Bethesda for using "the same engine" for years. And there's a definite air of world-weariness to some of the developer responses.

For context, that ties the best price we've seen for a 2TB NVMe SSD, although this option comes with a heatsink and is therefore a better choice for many PC and all PS5 owners.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The upcoming reimagining of Alone in the Dark is skipping Halloween this year. Instead of inviting players back to Derceto on October 25, the survival horror adventure will now arrive on January 16.
In a press release, developer Pieces Interactive offers a candid explanation for the move: it doesn’t want the game to compete with October’s heavy hitters like Marvel's Spider-Man 2 and another big horror game, Alan Wake 2. 
“Our intention is to avoid competing with the wake of Alan's epic release and to evade the dazzling skyline of cities adorned by the graceful swings of Spider-Man," Pieces writes. "We aim to truly remain as Alone in the Dark as possible. To honor this, the spine-chilling horror game has been rescheduled to unveil its horrors on January 16th, 2024. This extension will serve a dual purpose: not only will it permit us to meticulously perfect the gaming experience, but it will also grant us the opportunity to fully immerse ourselves in the remarkable releases of October.”
The studio also released a new trailer starring David Harbour’s Edward Carnby, one of the game’s protagonists, showing off his performance and impressive facial capture. 


Alone in the Dark is a modernized revamp of the 1992 survival horror classic that stars actors Jodie Comer and David Harbour as protagonists Emily Hartwood and detective Edward Carnby, respectively. Players control one character to explore the haunted Derceto hospital to solve a sinister mystery, with both scenarios offering different story threads and moments. You can read our full preview of the game here. It will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.]]></summary>

One is a Mario Kart 8 Deluxe bundle that includes a standard Switch model and the other two are special Animal Crossing: New Horizons-themed Switch Lite consoles that include the game. All three bundles will be released on October 6. 
The Mario Kart 8 Deluxe bundle includes a standard Switch console, a digital version of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, and a three-month individual membership for Nintendo Switch Online. You can check it out in the image below: 
As for the Animal Crossing: New Horizons Switch Lite consoles, there’s Isabelle’s Aloha Edition, which is a pink Switch Lite with Animal Crossing leaves on the back of the console, and Tommy’s Aloha Edition, which is a teal Switch Lite with the same leaf details on the back of the handheld console. Both bundles will cost $199.99 and include a digital copy of Animal Crossing: New Horizons. The Isabelle edition is exclusive to Target and the Tommy edition is exclusive to Walmart. 
You can check out both bundles in the gallery below: 

These three bundles come just days after Nintendo announced a new Mario Red Switch OLED console, which will cost $349.99 and releases on October 6 as well. Nintendo revealed this console during its Nintendo Direct for Super Mario Bros. Wonder, which we went hands-on with to preview. 
While waiting for these new bundles, read Game Informer’s Mario Kart 8 Deluxe review and then read Game Informer’s Animal Crossing: New Horizons review.

From the Stray Demons of Dark Souls through Bloodborne's Cleric Beast to the dragons of Elden Ring, you must learn not to be awed by creatures who look they could kill you with a sneeze. You must learn to run towards that titanic knight with the enormous shield, rolling between its colossal ankles, using its stature against it. You must learn to see past the visual overkill of a swing that would surely fell a skyscraper, registering only the effects on your poise and health bar. It's a learning curve, for sure, and that makes the modding of mechs from Armored Core 6: Fires Of Rubicon into Elden Ring a little more than the usual act of mischievous fanservice.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You may have seen that Alice Bee has started a "land on every planet" run of Bethesda's Starfield. By total coincidence - I promise you it's accidental, I was so pleased - I've been working on a "land on no planets" run of Starfield. The reasoning for this is as follows: people say that outer space is the worst part of the game, because it's just an irritating interval between the maps where the majority of quests, loot, intrigues, etc are found. It's a fast travel loading screen you can fly about in. But what if you double-down on the space stuff? 


What if you never descend from orbit, not even to repair, modify or upgrade your ship and offload inventory? What if, rather than buying new ships or building them, you progress exclusively by boarding other captains and making off with ship and cargo? How well does Starfield scrub up as a thoroughbred space sim that leans towards bloodthirsty piracy? Here to answer these questions is Mary Read, my custom character and budding astral freebooter. She's named for her distant ancestor, the legendary 18th century English buccaneer Mary Read. She's had a crack at life on shore, setting foot most recently on Earth's Moon, but from this point on, her fate and fortune lies amid the stars. Arrr!

In the 22 years since Shenmue’s debut, I’ve played the game 23 times. Twenty-three times I’ve lived the life of protagonist Ryo Hazuki, watched his father die, and navigated his world and experiences. Each time I’ve realized something new about the game, the people who made it, or something new about myself.
Playthrough 23 was the most poignant of them all. I saw, noticed, and felt things I hadn’t in any other, and it’s given me a new appreciation for Yu Suzuki and Sega’s AM2 development team.
More than anything else, Shenmue is a video game about how a real person in a real world inhabited by other real people experiences the death of a loved one and the loneliness that follows.

I’d spent the first few minutes referring to it as a sequel, but he clarifies, "It’s not Hyper Light Drifter 2. It’s a follow-up, meaning that it’s an installment in the franchise of Hyper Light. So it’s a different game, different protagonists, different gameplay." After getting the chance to learn more about the game and see it in action, this distinction makes a lot of sense. For me to call it a sequel was misleading, given how different the games look and play.
Breaker is a 3D rogue-lite with a strong emphasis on multiplayer. Players explore an area called the Overgrowth, collect weapons and gear, and fight off monsters. And though the…]]></summary>

Retro love letters are a dime a dozen these days. From titles that veer too close to the source material to games that take the kernel of an earlier game's original concept and expand it into previously unforeseen realms, nostalgic experiences are everywhere in the games industry. Yacht Club Games emerged as an early leader of this trend with its smash hit Shovel Knight, which took the 2D action-platformer genre and gave it several fun twists despite keeping the core gameplay and visual styles faithful to the 8-bit graphics with which many of us grew up. Similarly, Yacht Club's next game, Mina the Hollower, looks like a …]]></summary>

Void Stranger is the work of Finnish indie System Erasure, whose vertically scrolling shmup/mystery game ZeroRanger was one of Dominic Tarason's (RPS in peace) best games of 2018. The new title is a sokoban-style puzzle game, which is to say, it's broadly about shoving crates around, but as the name suggests, Void Stranger has bigger ambitions than helping you while away five minutes over lunch. It's a game of faith, amnesia and devilry, which reportedly portions out its secrets across multiple playthroughs. Here's a trailer.

It was actually my favourite act of the whole game - not that I doubt other people saw things going on the wonk a lot, but I did, thankfully, escape more or less unscathed (apart from one instance where, for some reason, Gale the smug sex wizard had a conversation with me, and then immediately repeated the exact same conversation). For me, the final act of BG3 is the act when all my nonsensing in the rest of the game paid off. The part where it turned out it did matter that I spent a painstaking hour separating and killing a bunch of guards in a mine, so I could save the gnomes trapped in a cave-in. It was also where a genie turned me into cheese.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am currently juggling two playthroughs of Starfield with very different aims. While Sayer the Space Scoundrel is having trouble getting around as they engage with the main story, I have started another character to engage in some nonsense (to the extent that there is any in Starfield) - the first of such I've detailed here.
I've said it before, but you're my very best friend, so we're going to play Starfield together. Join me as we step, wobbly and uncertain like Bambi on ice, into Bethesda's huge and partially procedurally generated space RPG universe for the adventures of Turbo Eclipse (I used an astronaut name generator intended for a child's party), a spacefaring nerd who longs only for the thrill of science. Yes, we're going to visit every planet in Starfield. Or at least as many as possible before I lose every single one of my marbles. And hey, planets look kinda like marbles! Strap in, spacefarers. Let's put this proc gen through its paces.

That's right, this month's RPS Game Club pick is the alternate-reality detective adventure Hypnospace Outlaw!


Released in 2018 and developed by Tendershoot, Hypnospace Outlaw takes place in a warped version of 1999 where accessing the internet is done via a headband you wear while you sleep. You play as an enforcer - a moderator of sorts - tasked with keeping the users of Hypnospace in check by reporting any violations you discover on their personal web pages.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As someone with a general aversion to online competitive modes in games, I'm always grateful when someone, for once, especially in this age of endlessly bland multiplayer experiments, thinks of the solitary solo player. I'm especially grateful when us single player preferers get a knowing nod of acknowledgement in fighting games, too, which are so naturally geared toward pitting your skills against other human beings that anything involving playing against the AI is often either an afterthought or so threadbare that you can't help but feel like you're missing the point. 
But that's still, for my sins, how I like to consume fighting games when I occasionally play them - which isn't often, I'll admit, for exactly the reasons described above - and so when I sat down for my Mortal Kombat 1 demo session at Gamescom this year, I was pleased to see not just a very slick story mode in attendance, but also a new single player challenge mode called Invasions that publishers Warner Bros described as "a giant interactive board game" that "lent into action RPG" territory. Its numerous node-based missions looked substantial based on what I played, and the idea of applying a seasonal service model to it, endlessly rotating in new locations and missions every so often - a whole different Invasion, so to speak - is actually something I'd be very much behind. It, that is, I was a) good at Mortal Kombat, and b) the missions I played during my demo weren't quite so… err… boring.

In the years since Sam Fisher’s last outing, 2013’s Splinter Cell: Blacklist, he’s made a handful of cameo appearances and even shown his battle-worn visage at a conference or two. And there is a remake on the way – of which we’ve only seen concept art. But by most measures, the franchise has been dormant for a decade.
Nonetheless, Fisher was once the lead of a game momentous enough to compete for sales with Halo, have Hideo Kojima’s Metal Gear Solid team taking notes, and find itself referenced as the graphical and technical benchmark of the early Xbox years.

The adventure game's strong premise of a writer magically entering books to steal treasures wore thin across uninteresting puzzles, repetitive crafting, bland combat, and—worst of all for a game about the wonder of words—iffy writing. But once the credits rolled, I realised I had been fooled by its polished looks, and its core development was team was tiny (with a squad of external contributors), leaving me feeling a lot more forgiving. So, it's a good game to check out on Game Pass, or at least flick through the opening chapters.

It’s the work of seasoned modder PureDark, previously seen hammering both DLSS and FSR into Skyrim. I’ve tried the Starfield mod and it works rather nicely, granting a visible quality boost on RTX graphics cards while equalling FSR’s ability to smooth out Starfield’s sometimes-tricky performance. Unfortunately (and largely by association), it’s also been dragged into a spot of nasty business, one involving a separate mod for DLSS 3 frame generation and PureDark’s application of DRM.

Especially when I get to the characters saying ‘I love you’ to each other…” Gaider mimes the sickliness of the scene and his own horrified response. “Apparently I did it so well on Baldur’s Gate II that James Ohlen kept handing me this stuff. And, god, I hated it so much.”
It’s weird, in fact, that Gaider wound up working on Baldur’s Gate II at all - let alone that he became synonymous with Dragon Age and romanceable companions afterwards. At 27 years old, he ran a hotel in Edmonton, Alberta - the same city where, unbeknownst to him, Bioware was busy making its name. Once it came time to make a sequel to Baldur’s Gate, Bioware cast around for local writers, and a friend recommended Gaider, who had played D&D in the ‘80s before it fell out of fashion.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Baldur's Gate 3 is a relentlessly horny videogame, Alice B wrote back in August, and that certainly describes the shock I felt when noted Githyanki grouch Lae'zel abruptly informed me that she was down to clown, a whole three hours in. "Ms Lae'zel, I happen to be a graduate of BioWare Sex University," I told her sternly, adjusting my robe. "If I'm going to have a torrid liaison in an RPG it'll be 60 hours from now, just before the final battle, and let's face it, I'm more likely to get scared of alienating party members and end up friendzoning everybody."
Lae'zel proved persuasive, however - "I like the way you stink," was how I think she phrased it - and one risque fade-to-black later, we were triumphantly entwined in post-coital bliss. Well, at the risk of empirically demonstrating that romance is dead, it turns out all that might have been down to a technical problem. According to Larian CEO Sven Vincke, Baldur's Gate 3 characters were accidentally encoded to have very low standards at launch. Haha, I certainly can't relate!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the bigger Discourse torpedoes aimed at Starfield's glittering hull over the past month has been its strict division between planetary surfaces and outer space. Space sim fanatics were dismayed to learn that you can't actually fly down to the surface of the planets you're orbiting - instead, you hit a button to initiate a loading break and a landing cutscene, which makes outer space feel more like a glorified airlock chamber than, well, outer space. This segmented approach has prompted many unflattering comparisons with No Man's Sky, in which you can manually pilot through the atmosphere. 


Players and critics were similarly disappointed by the apparent inability to manually fly between planets in different orbits - instead, the game invites you to pick a destination from your star map or while using your spaceship's scanner HUD, with the journey condensed to a cutscene, again. Well, I bring news on this front. You can actually fly "to" and perhaps even "between" planets in Starfield. But there are some buts. Buts of astronomical dimensions. Onward!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Newcomer studio Sonka has released a new gameplay trailer for its horror game, Holstin. This new trailer reveals a fun twist on the game’s shooting mechanics and comes alongside word that there’s a demo now available on Steam. 
The trailer is short, running less than a minute, but it showcases the game’s terrifying ambiance, throwback visual style, and zombie-like creatures that have seemingly infested the small 1990s Polish town Holstin is set in. It also highlights that parts of the game are playable as an isometric, third-person shooter like last year’s Signalis and as an over-the-shoulder third-person shooter like in Capcom’s recent Resident Evil remakes. 
Check out the Holstin gameplay reveal trailer for yourself below: 


“A psychological survival horror game set in an eerie, isolated 90’s Polish town consumed by an ominous presence,” the Holstin Steam page reads. “You’ve come looking for answers, but everyone seems possessed by something foul. Explore the festering town, interrogate locals, and fight ungodly manifestations to get to the truth.” 
There’s no release date in sight for Holstin, but you can try the game for yourself today through a demo available on Steam right now. 
Holstin is set to release one day on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Starfield is finally here after a long five-year wait, and it's great! I’m roughly 23 hours in, so I still have many galaxies ahead of me, but read Game Informer’s Starfield review for in-depth thoughts on the overall package. With years of build-up and anticipation, I, like many Bethesda Game Studios fans, let my imagination run wild with what this new open world RPG could be. Now that I’ve played a decent chunk of it, it’s quite different from the studios’ Elder Scrolls and Fallout series in some ways. Those two franchises are significantly more open world than Starfield. In fact, Starfield feels more like a great sci-fi theme park with exciting points of interests rather than an open world adventure. But players looking for a replica space-based Fallout or Elder Scrolls adventure might …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With Mortal Kombat 1 on the horizon, we're revisiting the entry that set the series on its current trajectory: 2011's Mortal Kombat (aka MK 9). Join us today on Twitch at 2:00 p.m. Central as we take a bloody journey through the game's genre-defining story campaign. Episodes will be uploaded to our Game Informer Shows YouTube channel the following Saturday morning. 
After 2006's Mortal Kombat: Armageddon seemingly concluded the franchise's main narrative, 2011's entry picked up the bloody pieces. It moved the saga forward by resetting the timeline, serving as a soft reboot that brought Mortal Kombat back to its 2D fighting roots and ushering in the return of the classic roster. MK 9's cinematic story mode served as an epiphany for the series and fighting games as a whole, establishing the blueprint for narrative fighting campaigns still utilized today. MK9's story also serves as the first chapter of the modern trilogy of games that Mortal Kombat 1 builds upon. For a whole lot more on MK9 and its development, you can read this feature on how the reboot saved the franchise.
Join editors Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard as they battle their way through MK 9 to see how its reimagined tournament holds up. 
Part 1 - Surpr-iced! 
Part 2 - Bringing The Smoke
