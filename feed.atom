        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When a new update happens in a live service game, things often break or have some kind of exploit. In the recent patches for Diablo 4 Season 5, trading has been disabled, leaving many players wondering why that’s the case or if the system itself is broken. 


Thanks to one such hiccup, Diablo 4 has disabled trading in Season 5. If you're looking for news on why the decision was made or when trading should come back, we've outlined Blizzard's response below. 


Why is trading disabled in Diablo 4?


Trading is currently disabled in Diablo 4 due to a trading exploit. Players were able to duplicate items very easily, making it very useful for farming up endgame items like Stygian Stones and Resplendent Sparks.


While news of this was very fresh on how to do it, Blizzard took swift action to disable all sorts of trading, even if you drop items for other players. 


When is trading coming back?


Right now, there isn’t any update on what time or date the feature will come back. So, if you’re looking to make a few million extra gold from lucky farming, you’ll have to wait. It should only take a week at most, or whenever the next hotfix is, so it'll be sooner since this is a shorter season too.

Can you get banned for the trading exploit?


There’s a fairly decent chance that you can get banned for participating in these types of dupe or trading exploits in Diablo 4. Just to be safe, you shouldn’t try to perform any sort of glitches that can get you in trouble or give you a huge boost in the game’s progression.


Unless it was a very specific glitch like the recently discovered (and now patched) one regarding a player who used the Rogue class and the Umbra Crux Unique dagger, you can’t get banned. 


Trying to replicate or find other ways to get aggressively ahead and skip all the grind in the game can get you banned, though. Just play the game normally and grind away.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The first official server announcement for Madden NFL 25 has been announced, and it's scheduled to take place on August 15.


This maintenance will affect all online game modes, which will disappoint those enjoying the early access. While the servers are taken down, matchmaking will be unavailable. The official X handle has shared some vital information that will help you plan.


When will Madden NFL 25 server maintenance begin


The first server maintenance will start at 6 a.m. ET/3 a.m. PT/5 a.m. CT. This is the same schedule that EA Sports has been following for all server maintenance of College Football 25. Solo battles will be gated 30 minutes prior to the beginning of the maintenance.


Unfortunately, EA Sports hasn't announced when the maintenance will be over. Since this is the first maintenance of Madden NFL 25, it's best to expect at least a few hours of downtime. This server downtime could be extensive, depending on the type of work that the developers will do.




Which Madden NFL 25 game modes will be unavailable during server maintenance


All game modes that have online matchmaking will be affected. You won't be able to log in to Ultimate Team mode. Even if you manage to log in, trying to matchmake will show you an error code. Any kind of online friendlies will be unavailable as well.


You can play the Franchise mode (as long as it's the single-player version) when the servers are down. You can also try out the Superstar mode. If you already have a complete RTG save on College Football 25, you can import that to Madden NFL 25 and continue the journey.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Destiny 2's exotic missions may not be the most exciting content in the game, nor do they require the most effort, but that's not to say they're worth skipping. They're still made with a ton of quality and care, sporting some great music, cool setpieces, and the same great art you expect. 


One such mission that rotates has you assaulting a Cabal base, though you may be wondering what you can get from it. Here's which exotic weapon is available from the Vox Obscura mission in Destiny 2.


What exotic can you earn from Vox Obscura in Destiny 2?


Image via Destructoid.


The Dead Messenger exotic grenade launcher is available from the Vox Obscura mission. It's available as an end-mission reward after defeating the final boss. This grenade launcher comes with the Intrinsic Trait Trinary Vision, which makes the grenade launcher a Wave Frame archetype with three separate waves splitting out from where it lands. 


It also comes with the perk The Fundamentals, which lets you hold the reload button to change the weapon element between Solar, Arc, and Void. Each provides a small stat bonus when it's the current element.


This weapon can be further improved through crafting, thanks to unlockable trait upgrades for the Trinary Vision trait. These are unlocked through completing the Vox Obscura mission several times on Master difficulty, with each completion granting a new level.


Is the Dead Messenger worth using?


Given its perks and strengths, the Dead Messenger is well worth using as an ad clear exotic in PvE. The ability to send out three waves can utterly wreck a crowd of ads with just one shot, especially since you can swap to meet any shields you might find and want to break. As for PvP, there's likely a niche use case though it's going to be far less effective.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In Madden NFL 25, having a fast QB is certainly a bonus as it opens up so many different avenues during attacks.


Usually, a quarterback's priority is to thread accurate passes to the receivers or hand the ball off to the runners. But there can be some situations where a QB can go on a solo run, and being fast on such occasions definitely helps a lot. In case you're wondering, there are some surprising names in the list of the ten fastest QBs in the game at launch.


Top 10 QBs in Madden NFL 25 with highest speed


The best attribute to determine a QB's speed in Madden NFL 25 is the SPD attribute. You'll find the mention of a few other attributes as well (some of them are key to a quarterback's performance). However, the ranking is solely based on their speed attribute alone.

Lamar Jackson is the outright king among the QBs when it comes to being fast. His 95 speed also means that you can go for some amazing runs with him on the field. In fact, he's only one of the two 90-rated athletes on this list, with the other person being Josh Allen. Jalen Hurts, with an overall of 86, is the only name in the 80-ratings club. 


Incidentally, Jackson is also the second-highest rated QB, as he's preceded by Patrick Mahomes, who has an overall of 99.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lionsgate might be trying to find a Vault full of cash right now, as the Borderlands movie box office numbers for its opening weekend are bleak. The film's domestic opening for the August 9 weekend brought in only $8.6 million, taking fourth place behind Deadpool & Wolverine, It Ends With Us, and Twisters for its debut. 


Overall, Borderlands made a worldwide box office gross of $16.9 million (via The Numbers), which is tiny compared to its reported $115 million budget (via IGN). Assuming the typical marketing spend outside of its production budget, D+ Cinemascore, and negative fan sentiment, Borderlands doesn't look like it'll make that money back.




Box office YouTuber and analyst Dan Murrell says that Borderlands will be one of the biggest box office bombs of the year, if not the largest. What doesn't help are the awful reviews for Borderlands, with our sister site WGTC calling the film "bottom of the barrel."


Surprisingly, some big names are part of the eclectic Borderlands cast, including Jack Black (School of Rock) as Claptrap, Jamie Lee Curtis (Halloween) as Tannis, Cate Blanchett (Thor: Ragnarok) as Lilith, and Kevin Hart plays Roland. Despite so many household names, series developer Gearbox may want to forget this entry ever happened, and remain focused on its new game in development. 


It's not all bad news for the Borderlands series, however. The third game has seen a 14.5% player boost on Steam over the past 30 days (via Steam Charts), likely due to the publicity of the movie (or viewers of the film who want to forget about it).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The new Agent, Jane Doe, has made her grand entrance to the ZZZ world, tying into the Undercover R&B episode. But if you look at the current banners, you'll notice that she's nowhere to be found despite her appearing in Version 1.1's patch notes. We're here to explain when Jane Doe comes out in Zenless Zone Zero and provide more insight into her robust abilities.


Zenless Zone Zero Jane Doe release date


Based on the banner schedule and the Version 1.1 Special Program, the S-Rank Jane Doe will be released on Sept. 4, 2024. The program confirms her debut for the latter half of the update as Qingyi takes the stage for launch. The A-Rank Seth Lowell will also be a part of the upcoming Zenless Zone Zero banner, which will likely have better chances at pulls.

As a Physical Anomaly Agent, Jane packs a punch with her Passion State, a form that launches multiple rapid attacks with considerable damage. She looks to be a pretty speedy fighter, just like the other Physical Agents, Billy Kid and Nekomata. Plus, Jane introduces a new faction, the Mountain Lion Gang, a crime syndicate known to stir up trouble.


Even though Jane Doe has yet to arrive in ZZZ as a banner, you can play as her during the Undercover R&B Special Episode. Moreover, she'll be the first character to roam freely around New Eridu, a feat that could only done with Proxies in its previous version. Expect more Agents to have this exploration feature in the upcoming updates.


If you want to understand Jane Doe's combat abilities, progress further in the current main storyline to unlock the Special Episode. You'll also get a glimpse of Seth Lowell's unique dynamics as he goes toe-to-toe with Jane in battle.

        <updated>2024-08-14T19:36:21.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Clear River Games and Bitwave Games have announced that the sequel to the 1992 NES/Famicom game Gimmick (also known as Mr. Gimmick) is releasing soon. Gimmick 2 launches September 5, 2024 for Switch and PC. PlayStation and Xbox versions will release later.


I’m rather surprised because we just got the first actual gameplay trailer last month, and the announcement of the game itself was a month before that. Not that I think a 2D revival of an NES game would have the most protracted development cycle, but I would think the PR run-up would be a lot longer.


Initially released in Europe and Japan in 1992, Gimmick gained a reputation for its deep, inventive, and extremely challenging gameplay. It also helped that the title also carries a tremendous price tag on the collector’s market. Despite its reputation, it remains a rather obscure title. However, its profile was lifted somewhat by the game’s re-release on modern platforms, Gimmick: Special Edition.




You play as Yokai Yumetaro, a diminutive green thing who can conjure and throw stars. The unique hook of the original title was the physics that control these stars, as you would not only use them to defeat enemies but also ride them over gaps. As I mentioned, it was a rather difficult game.


Gimmick 2 brings new visuals and a soundtrack by David Wise. It looks to follow the formula of the original title, but (and this is based off the trailer) it seems to focus more on puzzles and combat than it does on careful platforming.


Gimmick 2 arrives for PC and Switch on September 5, 2024. The date for PlayStation and Xbox versions will be announced later.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Picking a great offensive playbook in Madden NFL 25 will make your life easy on the field.


It's one thing to have star athletes in the offense, and it does make a difference. Having someone like Patrick Mahomes or Christian McCaffrey in your lineup will make it easier to reach the endzone. But running bad plays in attack with the best of talents will make little sense as your attackers will be brought down. Let's take a look at some of the best offensive playbooks you could utilize.


Best Madden NFL 25 offensive playbooks


In my experience, picking the best offensive playbook in Madden NFL 25 is almost impossible. When it comes to defensive playbooks, the options are a lot more narrower. The available options widen a lot when it comes to the offensive side of things. Here are some of the fun playbooks to try out if you're looking at trying out something else apart from the default.


Playbook
Benefits


San Francisco 49ers
Extremely flexible playbooks ideal for different situations.
Exceptional against wrong cover plays


New England Patriots
Playbooks are extremely suitable with the game's meta
Well-balanced playbooks that are suitable for beginners


Green Bay Packers
Well-balanced playbooks
You can try the playbooks in online matches


Miami Dolphins
The motion plays are brilliant at confusing the opponents
Ideal for those who rely on Shotgun and Tight formations






While you can't go wrong with the offensive playbooks of the four teams mentioned here, it's critical to observe the strengths of your team. For example, you won't want to make plays based around riskier passes if your QB and WRs aren't good enough.


Madden NFL 25 also allows you to create custom playbooks from the Creation Center. You can select one of the offensive playbooks mentioned here and tune it to suit your team. I haven't experimented much with this feature so far, but this can help you make your offense even more effective.

Antstream Arcade is a retro-focused streaming service. While it is primarily centered on arcade games, classic titles from other platforms have been added as well. Last year, it launched on Xbox, which is when I had a chance to review it (not on Xbox, I don’t own one). I found it to be a capable platform, but some of its limitations were a bit much for me.

The plan is to have three major milestones during Early Access leading into a capstone update for its full 1.0 release.




Described as a slapstick roguelike adventure, Lucky Tower Ultimate features cartoony graphics and comedic gameplay and interactions as you descend a massive tower, unlocking meta-progression with each successful run and accumulating loot and companions during your descent through the tower.


For those who have played the demo, the Early Access launch will feature new content including additional segments of the tower with new art styles and unique gameplay elements as well as new companions to liberate and enemies to defeat. The Early Access launch also adds Steam achievements.


The full release is expected sometime in 2025 and will include a final boss fight as well as the titles True Ending, and will fully launch on both Steam and the Epic Game Store.


Lucky Tower Ultimate enters Early Access via Steam on September 13, 2024. A demo for the roguelike is available now on Steam as well.

        <updated>2024-08-14T18:10:14.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dragon Age: The Veilguard, the upcoming RPG sequel from BioWare’s Dragon Age series, is set to receive a release date tomorrow. The upcoming trailer, releasing on August 15 at 9:00  a.m. PT, will finally let fans know when Dragon Age: The Veilguard will be arriving.




BioWare says that they will also be revealing gameplay in the coming weeks which will showcase “high-level warrior combat” featured in DragonAge: The Veilguard. There will also be a Companion Week which is expected to give us more information about the Companions who will be part of a player’s journey in the game.


Dragon Age: The Veilguard first went into development all the way back in 2015, so this release date trailer has been largely anticipated. The game was originally announced as Dragon Age: Dreadwolf in 2022 before it was renamed in June this year.


Not much is known about Dragon Age: The Veilguard but we do know that Solas is set to be one of the antagonists, if not the main antagonist in the game. Solas is also known as the Dreadwolf and the game’s rename at the last minute does suggest that there might be another villain in store.


BioWare general manager Gary McKay told IGN that sticking with Dreadwolf was a “safer choice” but explained that the team wanted to go with a title that was “authentic to the companions that are the heart of this adventure” and he added that BioWare has “worked throughout development to create really incredible backstories for each companion”.


During Companion Week, players should be able to learn more about the Companions for Dragon Age: The Veilguard.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Jonas Wind FUTTIES card could be yours for free in EA FC 24 Ultimate Team for absolutely free.


This is the first time when Wind has received a promo card in Ultimate Team. Since it's part of an objective, you can unlock the card for absolutely free. Let's take a look at all the tasks that have to be completed to unlock the card in the first place, and if doing so is worth your time and effort. 


EA FC 24 Jonas Wind FUTTIES objective tasks


The Jonas Wind FUTTIES objective in EA FC 24 has four different tasks. There's no set order of completing the tasks, but some of them will end quicker compared to the remaining ones. 



Catch the Breeze: Assist 5 goals using players from Germany in Squad Battles on Min. Semi-Pro difficulty (or Rivals/Champions).


Wind-tastic Goals: Score 6 goals using players with Min. 95 PAC in Squad Battles matches on Min. Semi-Pro difficulty (or Rivals/Champions).


Play 5: Play 5 matches in Squad Battles on Min. Semi-Pro difficulty (or Rivals/Champions) while having Min. 3 players from the Bundesliga in your starting 11.


Blown Away: Win 4 matches in Squad Battles on Min. Semi-Pro difficulty (or Rivals/Champions) while having Min. 3 players from the Bundesliga in your starting 11.



The best place to complete these tasks is in Squad Battles. You can control the difficulty of those games, making it really simple to quickly finish the tasks. Games in Division Rivals and Squad Battles won't be that simple, as you go up against other human opponents. 


This Wind item is a very basic card at best, even though it features the Aerial+ playstyle. The stats are very average, and it's best suited for beginners. However, I would still complete the objective as you get the bonus XP and the card can be used as fodder to complete other SBCs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Though the news that STALKER 2 would be pushed back to late November was quite painful, GSC Game World's attempt to sweeten the deal with a developer deep dive worked. We got a 30-minute gameplay session and now know for sure: this is a STALKER game through and through.


Explaining why this is the case is not easy, however. The last official STALKER game - Call of Pripyat - launched back in 2009/2010, depending on your region, and from that point onwards, mods have been the key thing that kept players coming back for more. Sure, the core gameplay loop was the crux of the STALKER experience, but fans the franchise has accrued since have been playing standalone mods more often than not.

If you never watched the Adam and Joe show, they used to do home movie recreations of famous films like Titanic and Saving Private Ryan using stuffed animals and action figures. I found these "Toymovies" hysterical as a kid - I suspect they are less so now. Probably, they are full of jokes we might tentatively class as "of their time". The point is, Reptilian Rising is sort of Toymovie: The Game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Get ready for some scares as Until Dawn is launching for the PS5 and PC on October 4, just a few weeks before Halloween. This Until Dawn remaster release date gives us enough time to gather your friends, microwave the popcorn, and enjoy the 2015 adventure all over again or for the first time. 


Until Dawn has been rebuilt for the PS5 and PC (via Steam) with this release as it's been developed in Unreal Engine 5 like the upcoming Halloween game. PlayStation touts on its Blog it has "updated character models, environments, interactable props, visual effects, and animations, all designed to maximize the Until Dawn experience on both PS5 and PC."

Other visual effects include more realistic real-time fluids. This is so "you can see all the gory glory" in everyone's updated character deaths. There's also an injury mask system that shows the cuts, bruises, tears (and there will be plenty of them), snow, and water on this game's victims.


In addition, the game will support raytracing and enhanced materials to give you a chilling experience on either platform. If you haven't played Until Dawn before, this is a cinematic game that is deeply affected by your actions in-game with a mechanic called the Butterfly Effect.


All of your characters can die, and the game will end. The whole cast could indeed live, but you'll need to pick the right narrative choices and succeed with your button presses. Our review gave the game a decent 7/10 score, despite high acclaim from its audience. "It allows for some predictable plotlines, hammy acting, and lack of meaningful choices, but I’m glad that it exists, and every horror fan owes it to themselves to play it at some point — especially at a price cut," it said.

I'll choose to ignore the fact that Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is arriving on October 25. Wait, forget that last part!



This deferral of the game’s release was a tough decision to make, however we believe that this additional time will enable us to ensure that our vision of the post-apocalyptic world of Terminator meets the expected level of quality.

It's 2D pixel art, with a limited colour palette as in EGA games, and you control it with a text parser, like King's Quest or one of them other Sierra adventures old men like Graham remember. It's important to mention this up front because it's very possible that, despite The Crimson Diamond's tale of betrayal, murder, and mineral rights in 1914 Canada, the text parser element will be a Rubicon you instantly can't be arsed to cross. A not unreasonable stance - though I think the text parser in The Crimson Diamond is fantastic. Such beef that I have with this adventure game is down to the specificity required to solve some of the puzzles.

One man has set a Guinness World Record for having the highest number of unique, working video game consoles connected to one TV. Talk about putting your collection to work... (thanks to our friends at Time Extension for spotting this!)
Ibrahim Al-Nasser, from Saudi Arabia, has managed to connect 444 video game consoles — each one different — to a single TV. And every single one works, too. Is it a fire hazard? Maybe. But we're more worried about all of those wires behind the TV. Though Al-Nasser has a method of keeping all of the cables hidden and tidy behind there. Plus, Al-Nasser hooks them all up using around 30 RCA switchers, 12 HDMI switchers, converters, and more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[KIBORG: Arena feels like a throwback in several ways that I quite enjoy. It’s a free prologue to the upcoming cyberpunk puncher KIBORG. The titular arena is a large room in which you, a large man, bash a large amount of enemies. You have to punch a gong between waves to trigger the next, and this struck me as a nice pre-emptive nudge that every problem you face in Kiborg can be solved by rapidly moving your fist towards offending objects, which turned out not to be too far off the mark.

Since then, we've heard nary a peep about it, with developers Obsidian focusing on Pillars Of Eternity successor Avowed and their ace survival game Grounded, which left early access in September 2022. According to Obsidian's studio head Feargus Urquhart, the project is rubbing along nicely. But it was not ever thus: during the opening years of the Covid pandemic, there was apparently "talk of 'do we stop Outer Worlds 2 and just throw the whole team on Avowed'."

The Deck’s long-promised dual booting capability, on the other hand, sounds further down the to-do list.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s been looking grim for Super Earth recently. I mean, not really. Multiplayer shooty Helldivers 2 is still sitting around 35,000 concurrent players, which is perfectly respectable, if only around 10% of its peak back in April. Still, a clutch of disgruntled ‘divers have recently found a novel way to protest an increasingly unpopular series of nerfs: laying down their guns and letting the bots take the damn planet.
“If Super Earth wanted to remain safe, they would stop nerfing our guns," reads one comment on the subreddit, in response to a post titled “Let the bots advance. Let the Super Earth burn.” It seems to have picked up some steam inside the actual game, too. As of earlier this week, there’s only around a thousand players actively trying to stop the bots advancing perilously close to the home planet, via Gamesradar.
Whether this is all massively overblown for the sake of a dramatic yarn or not, Arrowhead themselves have taken note of player concerns over nerfs. Yesterday, game director Mikael Eriksson unveiled a plan for the next 60 days, directly addressing player feedback over the controversial ‘Escalation of Freedom’ update.

Back when I was OXM's online editor, "free Xbox games" was one of our golden Google pillars, the other two being "Minecraft Xbox 360 update" and "Skyrim something something". Well, uncle Valve has just rudely torpedoed that ancient investigative initiative by adding a Trending Free tab to the Steam frontpage, encompassing prologues, demos, free-to-play games and that most treasured of jewels, a full free game with no monetisation elements, such as Grimhook.
Do not cry for us pitiful electronic scribblers, crowded on our melting internet icebergs. Play free games instead! Thanks to that new tab, I've just discovered a demo for neato wide-format tower defender Frontline Crisis. Hah, that'll keep the awareness of steady livelihood erosion at bay.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Aside from being a game where you run around a shopping mall murdering the living dead, the original Dead Rising from 2006 is a clownish satire of sleazy tabloid photojournalism. It expresses this by way of its scoring system, where you earn "Prestige points" for snapping pictures that fit one of five categories: "Brutal" scenes of characters being slain; moments of "Horror", such as the spectacle of an approaching horde; comical "Outtakes", like characters caught in bizarre poses; moments of "Drama", such as people reacting to discoveries; and "Erotic" photos of women alive or undead, which range from snaps of exposed underwear to close-ups of cleavage.
The Erotica tag has, however, been chopped from the Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster, in what Capcom gingerly suggest isn't "a response to a changing cultural climate", but expressive of the view that earning points from such photos is not "an appropriate reward for survival and not a skill required of a journalist trying to stay alive".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Steam Deck’s competitors, whether they’re the old guard Ayaneo family, the luxe Asus ROG Ally X, or the shapeshifting Lenovo Legion Go, usually share the same attack line: they can play more of your games. The Deck’s compatibility issues aren’t nearly as issue-some as they were at launch, but between its Linux-based SteamOS and its relatively mild processing power, but it is true that beefier Windows handhelds will more likely cater to your entire cross-launcher library.
Unless, that is, you get something else to run them for you. Streaming games on the Steam Deck has emerged as a nifty workaround for the portable PC’s lingering compatibility woes, making even officially unsupported games playable. Usually with much better performance, too, as the actual rendering work is done remotely – what you see on the Deck’s screen is basically a video feed of that remote device’s display output, with your control input beamed the other way via a low-latency connection. And because you’re not using SteamOS or the internal hardware to actually run the game, it’s not bound by their limits.

Publisher Clear River Games has revealed a new trailer for Omega 6: The Triangle Stars from developers Happymeal Inc and Pleocene ahead of its playable appearance at this year's Gamescom.
The trailer is the first English language showcase for the game, which is currently scheduled to release at some point in 2025. Boasting some lovely pixel art visuals, Omege 6 is the brainchild of ex-Nintendo developer Tayaka Imamura, who has taken the lead with its story and art direction. Shinobu Amayake, another ex-Nintendo dev, is composing the game's sci--fi-inspired soundtrack.

Little did I know that the humble premise of a small 2D spacecraft shooting baddies on a wrap-around screen would reach the glittering heights of Nova Drift. Had you shown me this game back in 1995, I dare say I'd have shmupped myself.

The entirety of the trading card community — that is, people who collect, buy, and sell the Pokémon Trading Card game, sports cards, Magic: The Gathering, Disney, or literally any trading card game you can think of — has gradually become aware of what might be an existential threat to the entire concept of opening up a blind pack of trading cards.
Over the past month or so, a series of events occurred across different corners of the trading card hobby which have snowballed into a panic, all stemming from one unlikely thing: CT scanners. Yes, computed tomography, like the kind of thing doctors typically use to see your insides, has now effectively been demonstrated on trading card packs and boxes to accurately show what’s inside without needing to open them.

Yesterday, Boss Team Games teased that it was making two games based on the classic horror movie franchise Halloween, with the original director John Carpenter "intimately involved" in the project. And we've got a few more details on one of those games, including a second game that picks up another horror movie favourite and a release date.
Courtesy of IGN, we now know that the first Halloween game will launch alongside a second game based on the Starz series Ash vs Evil Dead, which is a sequel to Sam Raimi's Evil Dead franchise. Developed by WayForward, the duo are part of the RetroRealms series, and both are beautiful-looking 16-bit platformers. Both games are coming out on 18th October 2024 and will be priced at $24.99 USD, or you can snag a "Double Feature" edition for $49.99 USD.

Doing this requires you to stand upright in full view, with your back turned upon an entire space station's worth of shiny domed technology and guttural industrial noises. Delightful!
Amongst the players harrowed and compelled by this fixture is Fede Álvarez, director of the 2013 Evil Dead remake, 2016's Don't Breathe and, most recently Alien: Romulus - the seventh and avowedly "back to basics" Alien movie. Isolation is the Alien experience that convinced Álvarez the Alien could still be scary, after decades of milking the creature's dugs for spin-off movies and making it share a screen with the Predator, the Pepsi Max to Alien's Dom Pérignon 1921. In possibly self-defeating homage to Creative Assembly's work, he's filled the movie with Emergency Telephones, turning them into a straightforward-sounding form of foreshadowing.

Alien: Romulus, the latest movie in the iconic Alien franchise, is about to drop in cinemas courtesy of director Fede Álvarez (Evil Dead, Don't Breathe).
Now, in an interview with Total Film (thanks, VGC), Álvarez highlights an interesting connection to Creative Assembly's remarkable survival horror game, Alien: Isolation. According to Álvarez, he paid tribute to the game by strategically placing telephones within the movie to indicate that a scary moment might be just around the corner.

Those 90s cowards. Abiotic Factor is the courageous game that has been correcting this historic oversight. It's fun, and the fun just got funnerer. The "Crush Depth" update, released yesterday, adds a heap of new areas to the game's messed-up scientific facility, including a dangerous Security Sector and a vast reservoir zone called the Hydroplant. On top of that there are new weapons, tools, workbenches, drivable vehicles, fishing rods, and quite a bit more. It's all shown off in the trailer below.

Limited Run Games' port of the cult classic Tomba! (or Tombi! in Europe) is out — in fact, it's been out a while now, having launched on 1st August — and if you've been looking forward to this one you're probably wondering where our review of this Special Edition release has gotten to.
We've seen reports online of issues with the 1997 PlayStation platformer ranging from major to minor across all platforms, and the devs have stated that there's a patch in the works to address known issues. The thing is, we've run into a serious issue that renders Tomba essentially unplayable on Nintendo's console — or one of us has.

Speculation abounds that these "leaks", coupled with Valve's obstinate silence about it, are a calculated publisher psyop. Are they deliberately letting people play the game early so as to temper the marketing rollout in some way? Perhaps handle any initial player criticism under cover of non-announcement? It seems unlikely, but as other writers have pointed out, this is Valve, unaccountable elder god of PC gaming. I guess we should be thankful it isn't another Half-Life tease.

Fortunately they're more easily determined in the downloaded order, but that doesn't mean precision blocking won't be needed. Perhaps now more than ever, one mistake could go terribly wrong.

Four joke topics appear at the bottom of the screen. Ridiculous celebrity kids names. Action figures for news anchors. Diet water sales boom. You cautiously slide that last one over to the microphone.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The first Splitgate was a cracker mash-up of Halo multiplayer gunfights and Portal's nifty spacetime windows. It was a gimmick that made flanking fun again, at least until you died to a distant rifle that was right next to you all along. Its sequel, Splitgate 2 is continuing that gimmick but is also sprucing up the free-to-play arena shooter with a few modern additions, like bum-sliding around corners and big deployable bubbles called "time domes" that slow down your enemies yet speed up your allies. All this and more comes from a gameplay trailer that went up yesterday.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Serie A's bid to force Cloudflare to participate in Piracy Shield, Italy's pirate IPTV blocking system, has failed. The Italian football league filed a legal complaint in April, claiming that Cloudflare assists and protects pirate services. In a decision handed down this week, the Court of Milan said that it has no legal authority to compel Cloudflare to join the program. The Court also denied Serie A's application for an injunction, for reasons that suggest this battle may not be over.

A merry old time was had, romping through fortress cities like a small herd of crusader buffalo, using the game's absurd jetpack functionality to pancake invading Tyranids, and getting our screens so slathered in gore we couldn't work out who was killing what.
It looks like the gargantuan action game's PvP multiplayer will be even messier. Saber and Focus Home have released an extended trailer that walks you through two major modes - the PvE boss and wave-slaying frenzy of Operations, and the 12-player PvP carnage of Eternal War, which spans a range of match types. The ecstasy of dying for the Emperor aside, both give me frightful flashbacks to the early days of Gears Of War.

It's also claws-out now on Steam, which has me feline fine.

In that time, many other survival games have sprouted, blossomed, and gently faded away. I first visited the burnt-out ruins of this zombie-infested world a decade ago and I returned to it this week to find a tree-puncher that, despite bearing the pockmarks of early access, retains much of what made it enjoyable back when the survival genre was still wearing its baby onesie. Instead of a review, I figured I'd scribble together a mini starter guide for new (or returning) players. Partly because the game is a proper time sink and it was taking me so long to get through everything. But mostly because I wanted to use that numberful headline. So, here you go: 7 dos and 7 don'ts in 7 Days To (7) Die.

Khaligrad is plenty scrappy. Its edges are rough and you have to figure it out yourself, but it's more intuitive than it appears, and easy to operate once you discern some basics. It's scrappy too in that it's, well. It's Stalingrad. Not really: its world is so fictional it's their 15th century. But the invaders are explicitly fascists and the defenders communists embroiled in a long and brutal semi-guerrilla city war with World War 2 technology. Thankfully, it's stripped of any actual fashy or genocidal play-acting beyond each side doing "hail the empire/union" bits as a sign off.
I think that's why, despite its brutal and difficult setting, it's this year's entry in the long tradition of Low-Intensity Strategy Games For When Hot Why Hot Please Stop You Cannot See My Begging Tears For They Evaporate.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[WolfEye's debut game Weird West attempted to pack a little of Dishonored's immersive sim sorcery into a top-down action-RPG. For the studio's next game, co-founders Raphaël Colantonio and Julien Roby are leaning into comparisons with their old endeavours at Arkane more earnestly. The new game - currently untitled and without a release date - is a first-person sci-fi RPG set in an alternate-1900s North America, which ostensibly combines the ingenuity and gadgetry of Dishonored and Prey with a "real RPG" experience redolent of Skyrim and modern-day Fallout.

Reduced score means I can squeeze in another card for more healing. If I can pull my Tarot card, I'll deal damage with each heal, and I’ve already pulled two scratch cards for yet more quick damage. Now, if I can just pull a Jack, I can plonk down the King Of Space And Time for a brutal finisher. That’ll transfer everything on my side over to my opponent’s, forcing a bust for a nice final chunk of hurt and…

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Spaceship likers, come hither. Long-running space sim Elite Dangerous has just unloaded a new interstellar vessel into its universe, and she's a beaut. The new Type-8 Transporter is a medium freighter capable of hauling a maximum of 406 tons of cargo. It's got a default jump range of 17.55 light years and two big prongs sticking out of its face like a sci-fi forklift. Cool. The catch is that this ship can only be bought with real money for now, say the developers. This is part of Frontier's new strategy of having paid-for ships in the game. I don't really play Elite Dangerous anymore, so I don't have strong feelings about that. But I do have strong feelings about the space trucker advertisement the developer has put together for the new ship. Come watch it with me.

Still, I wasn’t entirely convinced. The only thing that’s fun to slide back-and-forth indefinitely is a lounging cat on a smooth kitchen worktop. Still, after messing around with Sliding Hero’s Steam demo, I think this one might have much longer legs than its restrictive-sounding concept suggests. All the better to endlessly slide with.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It is I, the wound salter. The injury insult adder. Life By You, the simulation life-em-up from Paradox, was canceled in June after being delayed indefinitely. The day after the cancellation - which Paradox CEO Fredrik Wester implied was down to a “lacking”, unfixable development state - designer Willem Delventhal spoke about his time at the subsequently shuttered Paradox Tectonic. He claimed the team spent a month “in purgatory” prior to being told of the game’s cancelation and studio shuttering two weeks before launch, despite being told by higher-ups that work was “exceeding expectations.”
We’ve now got another look at a game we’ll likely never get, thanks to a thread by Twxbbly user SimMattically collating unseen screenshots from portfolios by several artists who worked on Life By You.

It's both a praiseworthy endeavour and an interesting breakdown of the voice-actor's trade.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dead Space developer and Striking Distance co-founder Glen Schofield left Striking Distance last September, following lower-than-hoped sales and mixed reviews for the studio's debut project The Callisto Protocol. Now, he's back to share a little about the horror game's difficult development, offering details of cut materials, a complicated relationship with parent company Krafton, the impact of Covid, and abandoned plans for a sequel.

The criticism appears in an amicus brief in support of a court injunction requested by music publishers, who want the AI company to stop using lyrics without permission. According to the RIAA, Anthropic's defense relies on the same rhetoric as Napster once did.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What if the company that sold your cheese also sold your PC gaming hardware? This is not the murmuring of some poor sod on a nineteen-hour Dota 2 binge who’s started thinking that the crumbs in his keyboard resemble a viable snack, but a bold new reality, one I recently found myself staring down during a trip to Asda. The supermarket chain – third biggest in the UK by turnover and purveyors of ill-fitting clothes and surprisingly good doughnuts alike – has added light-up gaming mice, keyboards, and headsets to its mountain of own-brand wares.
Asda being what it is (Americans, if you’re unfamiliar, think Walmart with less gun violence), it’s all dirt cheap as well. £17 for a full-size keyboard. £16 for an FPS mouse. Overwhelmed with curiosity, I ended up taking home a complete starter set (keeb, different mouse, headset, and mousemat) for £45, or about a third of the price of the Logitech G515 Lightspeed TKL that I’d shortly kick off my desk. Could this be a new frontier in affordable PC hardware, bringing tech to the masses in a way no specialist retailer ever could, or should supermarkets stick to cereal and meal deals? Surely the Asda Tech (real name) 4-in-1 Gaming Kit would have the answers.

The blockbuster JRPG isn't out on PC yet, and developers Square Enix have not given a concrete release date for it, but this does seem to be prep work for the inevitable. And with Squeenix in attendance at Gamescom, it's possible we'll know more soon.

My own very petty victory as the ultimate gambler aside, it's by and large an industry built on preying on the vulnerable, so it's no surprise that Balatro developer LocalThunk is so dead against ever seeing his poker puzzler used for evil that he's made a specific stipulation in his will.

Aside from a not-so-subtle hint that the orcs, ogres, and Khorne pack would feature at least one colossal squig, it also ended with a tease at smaller bits of new content coming alongside regular patches. As of the game’s latest hotfix blog, we’ve now got a better idea when we’ll start seeing some of these “smaller bits and pieces.” Bits and pieces? In this economy? Yes, and this month in fact. “Late August” to be precise by quoting a vague statement precisely.

We had Deviator last week - now, it's time for a bumper helping of the heebie-jeebies in the shape of Perennial Order. The title makes it sound like an eBay delivery of potted geraniums. The game festering beneath is actually a "plant horror" boss rusher with twin stick melee controls, unlockable "Instinct" abilities and one-hit deaths.
In a gift to headline writers everywhere, the developers, four-person Gardenfiend Games, are calling it "Hollow Knight meets Titan Souls", and who am I to deny them? It's got one of those "painterly" art styles, too, though other words come to mind, such as "rotted" and "unhallowed" and "manky". It's out on 6th September. Find a trailer nested below this paragraph like a venus flytrap poised to clamp around your fingers.

It's called "landless adventurers" and it'll let you play as disgraced dirtbag travelling the world in a sort of medieval gig economy. You'll be making camp, gathering followers, taking random jobs from local rulers, and catching infectious diseases as you try to travel safely through war-torn regions. It sounds amazing.

My feelings about the series have settled back from self-righteous fury over its Pentagon-sponsored war-fellating to a quieter, regretful sense that there have maybe been enough Call Of Duty games now, and that it would be nice if we could fill that infamous late October/early November release slot with, I don't know, games about witches instead, or maybe just turn it into a public holiday and spend the week lying on a mattress regarding the ceiling. Still: I've skinned and filleted enough COD in my time to know that Black Ops 6's new "omnimovement" system is going to ruffle as many feathers as it smooths. The short version is that it turns you into Max Payne.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In his Vampire Survivors review, Matt Cox described the game as something he could play with "one hand in a packet of crisps". I think about this quite often, actually, as someone whose largely offline friends (or Fortnite/FIFA pals) ask me to recommend them a game that's good or interesting. Show them something popular like Elden Ring and, despite its grandeur, it might prove too much in all facets. But Vampire Survivors? It's an easy sell: simple, digestible, ridiculous value.
All of this is to say, One BTN Bosses is from the same school of the easy sell. You can fight bosses with one hand in a packet of pickled onion Space Raiders, after all.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You’re dead at the start of rhythm-combat  RPG Nocturne, just arrived in some sort of afterlife waiting room after the apparent extinction of humanity. You get your bearings, and you soon meet up with another, only slightly irritating, small child. His name is Kimothy, which sounds like something you’d only say as a joke to annoy friends named Kim, and then only once because it would be stupid to say it again. It’s fine! Leaves flutter, rays of sun cavort through trees, and the music is utterly gorgeous. The game opens on twinkly piano and mournful strings, infused with a good dose of stirring JRPG whimsy, and soon transforms into whatever the genre of music is called that makes you want to immediately go on a massive adventure. Potion-punk. Slime-swing. Limit breakcore etc.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Is early adoption a chump’s game? I dunno about that, though between the Asus ROG Ally X and the Steam Deck OLED, those who stayed their hand on their earlier handheld gaming PC counterparts do have a couple of quality second-genners to choose from. Valve’s effort manages to wring multiple performance, design, and battery life improvements out of its new display, while the ROG Ally X makes similar upgrades with a bigger-yet-better take on the original ROG Ally.
The only thing to do, clearly, is make them fight. It’s probably in the Irish Code Duello or something: "Should one portable games box impugn another’s honour by releasing shortly after it, satisfaction must be claimed through a comparison article." My hands are bound here, folks, though if you yourself have been playing the waiting game on a handheld purchase, perhaps this little head-to-head can help you pick the right one.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cinematic platformer Bionic Bay opens on a scene of a very large egg doing very bad things - easily my third favourite genre of speculative fiction. You awake to a world of tree trunks that twist like viscera and corroded contraptions powered by luminous goop that’s stored in the balls, uh, big glass orbs. A beam of light soon fills your character with newfound vigour, which is a nice moment of triumph in what otherwise feels like a deeply oppressive rust pit, all unsteady platforms and jagged pipes.
It doesn’t take long before you start spotting examples of the reason Bionic Bay went viral earlier this week. Above your head hangs a painstakingly detailed mass of vents and cables, looming lifelike with dust and shadow and history. I stood and stared because I’d seen how the sausage was made, but I like to think I would have lingered longer than usual anyway. It really is just that impressive.

I randomly watched one of Stay/Night's many anime spin-offs, Fate Zero, during the pandemic lockdowns. It triggered a short-lived obsession with the Fate series - I even dipped a toe in the long-lived mobile gacha game Fate/Grand Order. As such, I think I'm the nearest thing RPS has to a Fate "expert". Join me for a brief and sporadically informed tour of a universe that has Shaped The Culture like few others.

The open-air town square event was a great success, but not without critique. Watermarks on the meters-high screen showed that the public was watching a pirated copy of the film.  When the press got wind of it, the major countered that "everyone was happy", which is hard to argue with, especially since there are no official cinemas nearby.

Last week it was carnivorous post-Soviet elevators, now it’s retro fantasy RPGs that devour themselves. In Super Dungeon Muncher, you are a teeny-tiny hero navigating a corridor-shaped map full of fireball traps and crumbling platforms, spinning coins and patrolling critters. That’s the “Super Dungeon” part. The “Muncher” part refers to the corpulent red monster guzzling the whole level in your wake.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the neat things about Norland's fantasy medievalism is that specialist knowledge is tied to characters. So if there's only one person in your village who knows how to brew tastier beer, and they die after being freakishly savaged by a passing wolf (it happens), suddenly your village will have no artisanal lager master. The results may be devastating. Luckily, you can share knowledge in a number of ways - by copying books, or having "wise conversations". The exception to this is child characters, whose pea-sized brains can't learn specialist knowledge, only soaking up basic attributes like "manners" from the teachers you assign to them. Well, until now. The developers for the Rimworld-meets-Crusader Kings catastrophe simulator have made kids a little smarter. They'll now learn more important things from their adult teachers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've never learned to drive, but every so often a well-meaning friend tells me I'd be good at it, because 'look, Edwin, you play all those driving games, surely they've taught you the basics'. Friend, here is what driving games have taught me: traffic lights are there for regional flavour; drifting is the same thing as cornering; other cars exist to serve as bumper cushions when overshooting a turn. Certainly, nobody wants a guy whose ideas about automobiles come from 2018's Wreckfest to be involved in the school run. On which note: THQ Nordic have just announced Wreckfest 2 - a fresh helping of destruction derby with fancified visuals and newly animate drivers who flinch and gesticulate when other drivers smash into them. Witness the carnage in the announcement trailer below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's a hell of a thing to showcase a remake weeks after kiboshing the developers of the original game. In early July, Gothic creators Piranha Bytes were reportedly shuttered as part of Embracer Group's mad race to trim costs, following their decade-long acquisition binge. Watching THQ Nordic's new Gothic Remake trailer, below, feels a little like watching a vivisectionist parade about in somebody else's skin. Still, the remake's developers Alkimia Interactive aren't to blame for Embracer's fuck-ups, and I am selfishly happy to see Gothic return as an Unreal Engine 5 production - even if I didn't play the original back in 2001.


Sin did play the original game, and in her 2016 retrospective, she paints an absorbing picture of a dark fantasy "microsociety" in which every community "has a reason to exist, a means of providing for itself, a social order, and a long term goal". It's a setup that reminds me of my beloved Roadwarden, even as the sight of grumpy lizards slinking through undergrowth has me silently mouthing "fus roh dah".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Titan Quest 2! Now there's a name you can set your watch by. No colons, no bespoke jargon, no tortuous subtitles like "Gaia's B.O.U.N.T.Y." or "Hyperion's Wild Rumpus" - just the steadying prospect of a titanic quest that, who knows, may involve actual titans. The action-RPG beneath the moniker appears similarly straightforward: it's about following a plot thread through a mythological world in top-down view, smashing Ancient Greek giga-crabs and the like to obtain shinier, pointier varieties of gear. I'm sure I don't need to tell you that there's an endgame in which you farm monsters for crafting materials.


Like Pandora opening her box, but without the accompanying tidal wave of sickness, curses and death, THQ Nordic have released a new trailer that talks you though all of this in detail. Here it is...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bungie have reportedly cancelled Payback, an unannounced project in the Destiny universe from former Destiny 2 game director Luke Smith and project lead Mark Noseworthy. Both Noseworthy and Smith appear to have lost their jobs in the course of Bungie's brutal cost-cutting this week, but Payback's cancellation pre-dates the layoffs. Envisaged as a Destiny spin-off, rather than Destiny 3, it was apparently dropped "a while ago".

        <updated>2024-08-02T16:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The first World Of Goo was a cheerful parade of goopy engineering with a sense of never-ending novelty (well, never-ending for about four hours). Every level would introduce a new goo type or a twist on the basic bridge-building puzzle that challenged you to get a gaggle of gurgling balls to the nearest pipe. World Of Goo 2 pursues that sense of novelty with just as much twitchy eagerness as its predecessor, throwing new toys and goos at the player in an effort to keep you on your sludge-coated toes. That pursuit doesn't always result in pleasing new levels, though. There is a "hit and miss" feeling to things this time around. But those hits are hits. For anyone who has spent the last 16 years yearning for more sticky structure-building: I hope you like comically unpredictable fluids.

Now that Valve have shown it’s possible to quickly turn around an upgraded handheld without enraging owners of the original, Lenovo have hinted at a new Legion Go, MSI have revealed an improved Claw, and Asus have released this here ROG Ally X. A ROG Ally, again – but better? Yes, it is, in almost every way except the speed at which it’ll plunge you into financial destitution.

Don’t get me wrong, I’m a big fan of those perpetually disgruntled ghosts and charming goofskulls, but I might not be writing about the platform game at all if I hadn’t seen it in motion, where the vision comes together a lot more. The Cuphead influence runneth so overly that it feels trite to even point it out, and I do think maybe opting for different music would have served it far better in this case, but you can’t deny that Ghosts n’ Goblins lance throw.

Additionally, Paradox are removing the option to preorder the game until they have a "robust" release timeline. Existing preorders on all platforms will be refunded, and all preorder-exclusive items will be added into the base game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With Valorant, Riot set out to integrate a bit of hero shooter into the Counter Strike template and made it a little more accessible than CS in the process. Now Mountaintop Studios, a new studio whose ranks include ex-Bungie and Respawn devs, have chucked themselves into the tactical FPS gauntlet with Spectre Divide. Made with input from former CS pro and streamer Shroud, it looks a bit like a mix of CS and Valorant, but has a big gimmick that sets it apart from the two: you can swap between two bodies. I… am cautiously optimistic? I think?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week's mass layoffs at Destiny studio Bungie were planned out months ago, former employees have told journalist Stephen Totilo at Game File (paywalled). According to Totilo, Bungie leadership "overstated their studio’s financial prospects to Sony" after the latter bought Bungie in 2022 for $3.6 billion. The latest cuts were necessary to prevent continued losses, says the report, after Bungie missed Sony’s targets following the release of last year’s Lightfall.

On the other, it makes me think of side-scrolling Soulslikes (Scroulslikes?) such as Blasphemous and the frantic worldbuilding of Rick & Morty.

Activision have released it as a 4GB open-source project that can be explored in a 3D model-viewing tool. That's cool. But among their reasons for doing so, there lies a predictably grubby logic: they want people to use the data to train AI.

In my brief time with massive Fallout 4 mod Fallout London, I’ve read a delightful terminal entry about a scientist who named his favourite radiated shrew “Big Dave,” thwacked several of said Radshrews with a walking stick, gulped down some expired pink wafers, and been informed of train delays due to “leaves on the track.”
“A British transport joke!” I said to myself, marinating in the sufficient amount of crown-mandated mild amusement. “Our organ-floggingly expensive yet vital public services are crap!” I was having a good time. Then the game public transported me straight to my desktop, and continued to do so at regular intervals over the next few hours, ranging from “just as this conversation was getting good” to “just as my save was about to load.” My upper lip almost quivered, I tell you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Well, would you look at that! I just got done pining for the merest whiff of Dungeon Keeper when what should appear on Steam but a free prologue for delightful voxel-arty management sim Dungeon Tycoon. I’m using the word ‘appear’ because, following yet more industry layoffs yesterday, I’m choosing to adopt the brain of an idiot as to shield myself from the crushing reality of material conditions. So, anyway, the magical game goblins whacked the demo on Steam, and I’ve been having a lot of fun with it. Thanks, adequately compensated and unionised gobbos!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Having a list of Suffolk amusement park mascots one desperately wishes to outlive out of an innate desire for revenge is, I imagine, not a universal experience. Still, on the day Pleasurewood Hills mascot Woody Bear is taken by the soil, I will jig and whoop under the moon. I actually cannot remember when the beef started, but my mum reliably informs me that I was terrified to tears by this bear as a child.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Destiny and Marathon developers Bungie are laying off 220 people - around 17% of their total workforce - as studio heads try to offset a financial crisis brought on by "overly ambitious" expansion, individual project "misfires", and a wider economic downturn in 2023. Bungie are also transferring a further 155 roles to parent company Sony Interactive Entertainment, and are spinning out an untitled incubation project - an "action game set in a brand-new science-fantasy universe" - to form a new PlayStation studio.

The developers have just released a nine-minute explainer video, which teems with scenes of gimp suits, winged vans, rocket-propelled pinkies, vicious card battles against small excited dogs, and a surprisingly in-depth management component. There are bits that make me think of Batman: Arkham City, and bits that make me think of Pathologic, and bits that make me think of Yakuza - a combination fit to burst the brain. Quick, before your brain bursts, watch the video for yourself below.
