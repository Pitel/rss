If you've been wondering what's next for the Dragon Ball fighting series now that FighterZ is winding down - here it is! At the recent 'Dragon Ball Games Battle Hour 2023' event, Bandai Namco teased a new Dragon Ball Budokai Tenkaichi game.
In the trailer, you can see Goku is in his Super Saiyan Blue form, which means there could be a lot of content in there related to the Dragon Ball Super series. After the teaser was shown, a bit more information was provided by the host - revealing this new title was still in the "early stages of development". No platforms have been announced at this point in time.

Harebrained Schemes, the studio behind Battletech and the Shadowrun Returns trilogy, has a new strategy game. Today, Harebrained and Paradox revealed The Lamplighters League, a pulp fiction adventure that mixes stealth and strategy with quite a look.
Announced as part of today's Paradox Announcement Show, The Lamplighters League definitely has an XCOM sort of vibe to it. You manage a motley crew of misfits, all working together to stop the Banished Court cult from taking over the world.
As the tagline notes, "Unfortunately, the best of the best are all gone, so now it's up to the best of the worst." Today's announcement trailer emphasizes that a bit, as your team are not quite pristine heroes, so much as endearing rapscallions.

The Adata Legend 800 has been steeply discounted at Ebuyer, where £92 plus £3 shipping gets you this new model capable of 3500MB/s reads and 2800MB/s writes.
Yes, this isn't the best gaming SSD in terms of raw speed, but its PCIe 4.0 design means that it uses less power and fewer lanes than PCIe 3.0 alternatives of the same speed, a nicety for desktop use and a big deal for laptops.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey Yo, (yo)
Guilty Gear Strive superstar Bridget is the latest beloved gaming character to join Good Smile Co's "Pop Up Parade" range of affordable figurines. The yo-yo swinging scrapper is available to pre-order now at Good Smile Co. and other anime-lovin' toy stores.
Produced by legendary merch-makers Max Factory, Pop Up Parade Bridget stands a little under seven inches in height and is rocking her modernized Guilty Gear Strive look — standing in a cute 'n' coy pose with her "Tricky Spinner" in hand. Like her Pop Up brethren, Bridget is a static figurine with zero points of articulation or any accompanying accessories, but that doesn't mean that she isn't sporting some fine detail and great, vivid coloring.

If you want to pick up a Bridget for your bookshelf, then you can pre-order her now from the official Good Smile Co. website or whichever anime/gaming merchandiser is your turf. Bridget retails for around ¥5,500, (roughly $40 USD), not including any shipping or potential customs charges. She is expected to come rolling into your world later this summer.
Since Bridget made her Guilty Gear return, our girl has become pretty popular on the merchandise market, with this adorable plush doll, also from Good Smile Co., and this devastatingly expensive replica of her iconic bullet yo-yo. Additionally, Bridget has featured highly in the realm of fan art projects, such as this cute PS1-style animation. She's most certainly on her way to becoming one of the franchise's most recognizable characters.
Guilty Gear Strive is available now on PlayStation and PC platforms. An Xbox port will arrive this spring.

You might want to be cautious playing Pokemon Scarlet and Violet for the time being. Several players have reported that their Pokemon Scarlet / Violet save files were wiped following the most recent game update, and there isn't a clear cause just yet.
Over on the game's subreddit, as reported by Kotaku, players have been discussing the issue. Reports of the issue are popping up in a thread here, starting with "at least 5" and climbing from there.
"Obviously this is a small number of players overall, but people need to be aware there is some level of risk," wrote the original poster. "I lost a 595 hour save file because of this, and so far nothing can be done to recover my save."
Right now, the silver lining is that this issue seems to be …]]></summary>

The controversial and highly lucrative FIFA Ultimate Team system is in hot water once again — This time, the trouble comes from an Austrian court, which has officially ruled that the microtransaction-based digital card collector violates the nation's gambling laws.
As reported by German news outlet GamesWirtschaft, the verdict comes at the end of a 2022 lawsuit that was filed against Sony Interactive Entertainment by a group of PlayStation FIFA players. The suit is directed at Sony rather than FIFA publisher Electronic Arts because the FUT packs were purchased on the PlayStation Network, which makes the sales contract with Sony, and not with EA itself.
The court decreed that players being able to sell FUT cards on a secondary market a…]]></summary>

Anila, who is classed as "Queen of the Sheep and ruler of the South-Southwest" is an incredibly fun-looking character, who will step forth into battle armed with her trusty polearm and supported by a huge flock of obedient wool-bearers.

This follow-up builds upon its 2015 predecessor with new features, such as fully-realized transportation and economy systems. Paradox didn’t reveal too many other specifics beyond stating in a press release that the game features “ a wealth of construction and customization options and advanced modding capabilities.” Cities: Skylines II is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S (including Game Pass), and PC. Check out the teaser trailer below:


The original game was a big success, having sold over 12 million copies and filling the simulation gap left by SimCity's hiatus. Developer Colossal Order has supported it with multiple updates and expansions, including a VR port and a recent current-gen remaster. You can read our original reviews of Cities: Skylines on PC here and the console edition here.]]></summary>

The Nintendo 3DS eShop is closing down later this month. But before the doors close, Silver Falls series developer Sungrand Studios is getting one last launch on the Nintendo 3DS.
Sungrand has announced that two Silver Falls titles are headed to the Nintendo 3DS, in one bundle. Silver Falls Gaiden Deathly Delusion Destroyers and Silver Falls Ruby River both arrive on the digital storefront on March 9.
The two games will be bundled together into one for $16.99, going live only in North America on March 9. It doesn't sound like there are plans to create any physical copies at the moment, either. So you'll only have a narrow window of time before the 3DS eShop closes later this month.
Deathly Delusion Destroyers looks to be a "battle RPG," as the developer describes it. Holding the 3DS sideways, your characters hold out on the right-hand side while enemies flow in from the left. It reminds me a bit of that Flash classic, The Last Stand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-TXT4-zySs
Ruby River, meanwhile, looks like a first-person survival crafting situation. You build a shelter, start a fire, cook steak, and generally try to stay alive as horrors strike.
Heading back to Silver Falls
Sungrand Studios is no stranger to releasing games on platforms that will soon cease to exist. Both Silver Falls - White Inside Its Umbra and Silver Falls Undertakers released on the Wii U for NA last month, and the Wii U is also due to close its online shop soon.
Heck, Sungrand has another Silver Falls game on the 3DS already, though our reviewer wasn't so keen on Silver Falls: 3 Down Stars. I respect the effort to try and be one of the last games on a soon-to-close digital platform, though. If you're still aching for more games to fill the 3DS slots up, the new Silver Falls bundle goes live later this week on March 9.

As part of the Paradox Announcement Show, Paradox Tectonic has announced Life By You, which at first glance is looking like a take on The Sims. A teaser trailer has been dropped, with the promise that we’ll get a deeper look on March 20.
[embed]https://youtu.be/ZNhV-Gnjdy8[/embed]
While it doesn’t seem like Cities: Skylines developer Colossal Order is involved, I felt that this would be a natural progression for the publisher as a whole. Some of the footage seems to imply a wider environment than just the household. That said, I can’t fathom how a smaller developer could compete with the incredible monolith that The Sims 4 has become. Still, I have hopes, but we’re going to have to wait to find out more.
More news about Life By You will be coming on March 20th.

As part of the Paradox Announcement Show, the publisher has finally teased the coming of Cities: Skylines II with a tentative release date of this year. So far, we’ve only got a teaser trailer to whet our appetite and that kind of sucks.
https://youtu.be/vP_h2OM2zFY
Cities: Skylines was released eight years ago in 2015 and has enjoyed continuous updates. Released in the fallout from the massive disappointment that was 2013’s SimCity, Colossal Order’s city builder has sold millions of copies. Numerous expansions have built upon the game’s bones, but many, like myself, have been awaiting the next big iteration. I don’t exactly know where they can go from Cities: Skylines, but I have a wishlist. I mostly just want my city peeps to have more depth. Let me zoom right into their nostrils.
"The Cities brand has been an important part of Paradox’s catalog of games for over a decade. Cities: Skylines is a profound success, selling millions of copies, welcoming more than 5.5 million new players just last year, and setting the foundation for Cities: Skylines II," said Fredrik Wester, CEO of Paradox Interactive. "With unprecedented amounts of customization and player control, Cities: Skylines II will continue to push boundaries for the city-building franchise."
Cities: Skylines II is slated for Xbox Series X |S, PS5, and PC this year.

Sherlock Holmes' next virtual mystery is arriving soon after all. Developer Frogwares has announced that Sherlock Holmes The Awakened has gone gold, and will go live for PC, PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch on April 11.
Pre-orders are going live on storefronts today with three editions. The standard edition will run $39.99 on all platforms. Deluxe, meanwhile, will net you some side quest packs and additional outfits for $10 more, while the premium rolls in a digital artbook and soundtrack for $54.99.
In a press release, Frogwares confirms Sherlock Holmes The Awakened is "content complete" and playable from start to finish. A new trailer showing Holmes' investigations into the horrors of the deep is out too, so you can see just how creepy this one will get.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV0Dmvxjld4
Mysteries of the deep
Frogwares is based out of Kyiv, Ukraine, and has been sharing updates about how the conflict in the region has been affecting development. Much like fellow Ukranian developers GSC Game World, the invasion and ongoing fighting has greatly affected the project, and the update from a few weeks ago showed just how the power outages and other factors have affected development of Sherlock Holmes The Awakened.
The Awakened is a remake of Frogwares' own 2007 Sherlock game. In the time since, Forgwares has made plenty more Sherlock, and also released the Lovecraft-sans-Holmes mystery The Sinking City. I'm betting that fans of this series are probably curious about how the studio approaches this older work now, with many more years of making Sherlock games under its belt.
Sherlock Holmes The Awakened arrives on April 11 for PC, Switch, PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X.

And now, Magic Design Studios is taking up the black cloak with Have A Nice Death, a roguelike all about corporate burnout and the cycle of death, all with an absurdist humour twist.
Boasting stunning hand-drawn visuals, Have a Nice death is stylish, silly, and stuffed full of snappy combat. You'll get to explore Death, Inc. as the CEO of the company, Death himself, as you try and get your employees into shape. Some employees are reaping too many souls, while others are overindulging. So Death needs to put his (skeletal) foot down and march through the ever-changing offices.

After a series of leaks this weekend, it has now been confirmed that Growlithe will be the next Pokémon to get the Build-A-Bear treatment. The Fire-Type has begun to appear in online stores for those who are part of the Build-A-Bear Bonus Club, and we imagine that general access will be just around the corner (thanks, Nintendo Everything).
This cuddly Growlithe is currently available to purchase online as a part of a bundle only, which also adds in a cape, pyjama set and 5-in-1 sound chip alongside the plushie. This set (currently listed as an online exclusive) will set you back £56, which is the kind of price that we have come to expect from the collaboration.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Puma has unveiled a new shoe collection inspired by the popular MMORPG, Final Fantasy XIV. 
The collaboration will consist of four shoes: two Puma Slipstream models and two RS-X models, as reported by Techraptor. For each model type, there's a (Warrior of) Light version and a Dark version, which basically equates to white and blue-green, and black and purple-pink. All four of the shoes look great but before you get too attached, these shoes are Japan-only for now. There's no word on if they'll come to the U.S. 
Check out the shoes in the gallery below: 

Each of these shoes will cost 17,050 yen, which is roughly $125, according to Techraptor. They will be released in Japan next week on March 15. 
Shoes inspired by video games have risen in popularity, with Converse releasing two sets of Pokémon-inspired shoes last year. Perhaps more than any other shoe maker, though, Puma has been steadily releasing video game shoes. In 2018, it released a pair of sneakers based on Sonic the Hedgehog's iconic red shoes and then in 2020, Puma released a line of Super Mario All-Stars shoes. Puma announced some NBA 2K21 shoes in 2021 and then just two months later, the company revealed an Animal Crossing: New Horizons line of sneakers. 
While waiting to learn more, read Game Informer's Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker review.

The Japanese Pokémon Twitter account has announced where the spotlight will land for its upcoming 7-star raids for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. It’s Decidueye! The dashing bird-of-prey and final evolution of Rowlet, one of the original starter critters from Pokémon Sun and Moon.

You’ll have two opportunities to bag this owl:
March 16, 7pm EST to March 19th 6:59pm EST
March 23, 7pm EST to March 26th 6:59pm EST
Since Decidueye and its earlier forms aren’t part of Paldea’s Pokedex, this will be the first opportunity players will get to add it to the pile. Beyond that, this Decidueye will be unique as it comes as a flying tera type. As much as I didn’t love Pokémon Sun and Moon, it offered a pretty memorable selection of starters. Rowlet was my pick, if only because Decidueye is a rather striking final form.
Pokemon Scarlet & Violet are available now on Nintendo Switch.

Nintendo Europe has today revealed the same offer for the continent, though its contents are slightly different.
Instead of getting to choose between a copy of Super Mario Odyssey, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe or New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe, the European bundle will come with a copy of Odyssey as standard. No option to change.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As I have complained about mightily in the past, I grew up somwhere that didn't have much in the way of entertainment, so me and my friends had to engage in the time honoured tradition of making our own fun. Once we reached about age 17 this included playing poker with a shared second-hand chip set, and trying to do beer centurions (the progress in the latter affecting our interest in the former). I was never any good at it because, though poker was a fixture for several years, I was never really able to learn the rules. What hand is good? Why has your hand beaten his hand? But the little pictures are the best, I don't understand! It's disappointing because understanding poker is a cool adult thing, plus not understanding it makes certain pivotal scenes in James Bond films quite hard to parse.
Last week we got an email (shout out Aidan) singing the praises of Aces And Adventures, and I do try to check out recommendations from readers, even if I don't have time to reply or to write about the games. In this case I've made a special because Aces And Adventures is a great game that is teaching me winning poker hands through the medium of a dwarven warrior smashing things.

[WARNING: This review contains light campaign spoilers]
Since the release of Destiny 2, many questions in the space shooter's lore history have been answered, but many more have been equally opened. Unfortunately, it seems that Bungie has struggled to adjust to its "new" release schedule, with Lightfall intended initially to be the closing chapter of the "Light and Dark saga" — a narrative which has been ongoing since the release of the original Destiny in 2014.
As it now stands, this saga is expected to end sometime in 2024 with the release of the closing expansion The Final Shape concluding the story's 10-year span of content. With so many questions left to answer, does this negatively impact our experience of Lightfall? In short yes, but also no.

We feel like we should be used to unusual collaborations, but they don't get more unexpected that a miniature train exhibition and a retro-style JRPG. Square Enix DE has partnered up with a German miniature train exhibition in Hamburg to recreate one of Octopath Traveler II's most memorable scenes — and it's really rather lovely.
The staff at Miniatur Wunderland, the largest model railway and airport exhibition in the world, have created the campfire scene which adorns the game's box art in lovely minifigure form. All eight travellers — Ochette, Castti, Throné, Osvald, Partitio, Agnea, Temeons, and Hikari — are gathered together, tucked among the trees, each with their own little figure. The figures were all hand-made by the staff and each represents the character's personality perfectly.

I’m not the biggest lover of roguelikes. I maybe avoid them a little less than I used to but listing that little influence in the bullet points still isn’t a way to sell a game to me. However, I do love Castlevania. Throwing that full name (Metroidvania doesn’t count) into your press release is a better way to get me salivating. So, yes, the Return to Castlevania DLC was enough to get me to fully pick up Dead Cells.
What’s amusing is that I last played Dead Cells around the time I was reviewing GetsuFumaDen: Undying Moon, which was a revival of a forsaken Konami franchise that largely took influence from Dead Cells. So both times I’ve played Dead Cells have been due to a Konami franchise. Don’t look at me like that. I found it funny.

However, its success is only possible through standing on the shoulders of the giants that trailblazed the genre. Of all the franchises Dead Cells drew inspiration from, perhaps no series was as influential as Castlevania. Because of this, the crossover between the two, which comes in the form of premium DLC for Dead Cells called Return to Castlevania, is a natural fit that not only resurrects Konami's dormant franchise but gives a nostalgic shot in the arm to one of the best roguelites available today.
Diving back into Dead Cells for the first time in years, I couldn't help but effortlessly fall back into the hooks of the stellar gameplay loop. I love discovering secret ar…]]></summary>

We are nearing the release of Metroid Fusion on the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack GBA library on 9th March, and it's fair to say that we are all pretty excited. Nintendo published its own advert for the upcoming release just last week, but those after a real throwback might want to check out the game's original commercial from 2002 — the director's cut of which can be seen above in HD.
They just don't make ads like they used to, do they! Instead of focussing on unimportant things like, we don't know, gameplay and retail information (*yawn*), this 20-year-old advert is all about pulpy vibes and we kinda love it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Looking down the barrel of a gun, son of a gun...
Fans of Epic Games' Fortnite are currently picking apart new rumors that an all-new first-person mode is in the works for the battle royale juggernaut, with established leakers suggesting that the new perspective on Fortnite's cartoonish chaos will be arriving in the game's next season.
Fortnite has been a third-person battler ever since its initial launch in 2017, back when perhaps none of us had any idea of what a staggering global success Epic Games' venture was set to become. While some weapons in the game world already come equipped with first-person "iron sights", this supposed new mode would see players explore the game world directly through the eyes of their avatar — from first drop to failure.
https://twitter.com/HYPEX/status/1631821256688300033?s=20
Several credible Fortnite leakers have lent weight to the rumor, including @HYPEX, @GMatrixGames, @ShiinaBR, and @iFireMonkey. The new mode would certainly bring a whole new perspective, (literally), to the massively multiplayer scrapper, and perhaps the ever-encroaching storm will seem even more concerning when you're looking at the dang thing with your own two eyes... or Robocop's, or Ryu's, or Bruce Campbell's, or Jinx's, or whichever of the baffling choice of pop-culture figures you have purchased for your own trip into Fortnite's litany of islands.
While there is currently no launch date for the third season of Fortnite, the current season is scheduled to end this week, on Wednesday, March 8 to be precise, so we can probably expect official word on Chapter 4 Season 3 and its contents very soon.
Fortnite is available now on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and mobile platforms.

Despite what you may initially think, combining a fitness game with much-loved manga and anime series Fist of the North Star isn’t the completely left-field crossover it appears to be. In fact, it’s not even the first game based on the IP that makes the player swing actual punches.
Many years ago, this writer used to regularly frequent the Trocadero in London (RIP) to play the brilliant Fighting Mania: Fist of the North Star, a Konami arcade game where the player had to put on boxing gloves and punch six pads which would come out in various patterns. It’s not an exaggeration to say playing it was a regular highlight in this writer’s life at the time, despite not having much interest in Fist of the North Star.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bandai Namco has revealed a new Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi game. 
Yesterday, the publisher released a short teaser trailer for the game, running less than a minute, that highlights footage from previous Budokai Tenkaichi games before showcasing what appears to be the new one. In the footage of the new game, we see Goku powering up. And then the words, "Get Ready For Battle" and "A New Sparking Begins" appear on screen. 
Check it out in the Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi teaser trailer for yourself below:

「ドラゴンボール Sparking！」シリーズ

March 5, 2023
As you can see, the game might be called, in some variation, Dragon Ball Sparking (that's what the tweet calls it if you use Twitter's built-in translate function, too). But regardless, the trailer ends with "A New Budokai Tenkaichi" begins, quelling any doubt that this is a new game in the series that has laid dormant for 16 years. Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi 3 was released in 2007.  
The teaser trailer doesn't indicate if this is Budokai Tenkaichi 4 or something else but it's exciting nonetheless to see that Bandai Namco hasn't forgotten about the series. It is somewhat surprising to see this announcement, though, considering Dragon Ball FighterZ exists. Budokai Tenkaichi is a fighting game series as well but to see a new one before a sequel to FighterZ, which was released in 2018, is something I imagine not many people could have predicted. 
While waiting to learn more about this Budokai Tenkaichi game, read Game Informer's Dragon Ball FighterZ review.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Skyrim came out I was a student, and I worked in Gamestation (RIP) to help pay for chicken noodles. I remember the hype around it very clearly because Gamestation had a deal where you could buy it for like £22, and I had a sideline going when the stock was low to keep some back for my friends. Apols if you were caught in the crossfire for that, but dragon fever was running high off the back of a still very cool trailer, and shouting Fus Ro Dah was the only cure. 
In the years since, Skyrim has been released and re-released many times, on every conceivable platform. "Arrow to the knee" jokes became de rigueur and hacky almost overnight, and at this point might have horse-shoed back around to being funny again. There are many examples of unrelated games or videos that cut to black fading back up into the opening of Skyrim, in a kind of sub-genre of rickroll. Does it hold up now? Kind of. It's a really fun, ambitious RPG, with faults - but if the faults didn't exist maybe it wouldn't have been as popular as it was.

The latest instalment in Square Enix's Final Fantasy rhythm series, Theatrhythm Final Bar Line, played its way onto the Nintendo Switch last month to high praise (we gave it a 9/10 in our review). A new big-fixing update was released for the title's PS4 release last week and we are now happy to see that the tweaks have made their way over to Switch.
This update is focussed on fixing five different problems that have been found in the game since release including unexpected freezes and incorrect credits on certain songs. All of these issues now appear to be solved, though the team at Square Enix is always on the hunt for more by the looks of it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Virtuální Bastlírna slaví 2 roky svojí existence. Pravidelná každoměsíční online setkání s diskuzí nad tématy ze světa vědy a techniky, zejména z praktického pohledu, často ale i s nadhledem a humorem, jejichž tradice vznikla za Covidového lockdownu. Tak jaká témata si bastlíři z projektu MacGyver.sh připravili na toto jubilejní 24. setkání? Určitě bude zmíněna statistika samotné Virtuální Bastlírny. Zajímalo by Vás kolik unikátních návštěvníků se v online prostoru bastlírenského Zoomu již sešlo a kolik bastlířo-hodin prodiskutovalo?

Ze světa HW pak kluci vyhrabali 100 MSa/s osciloskop postavený na RP2040, energeticky úspornou technologii pro přenos dat mezi senzory umístěnými na lidském těle, nové velice levné ARMy pod 5 Kč a nové procesory od ST, požár v továrně na čipy, falešné CO2 monitory, Raspberry debug probe, nový nástroj na tvorbu plošných spojů nebo blížící se semináře a webináře o elektronice.

Za SW zase třeba zbrusu nový KiCAD 7.0.0, emulace zvukové karty Gravis Ultrasound na RP2040, probíhající standardizace šifrovacích algoritmů pro IoT, podpora Bluetooth v Rpi Pico SDK, jak se dělá raytracing na FPGA nebo spolupráce mezi projekty KiCAD a Inventree.

Ať už vás zaujalo cokoliv z nabízených témat, chcete ukázat nějaký svůj bastl a nebo si jen potřebujete postěžovat na nedostatek volného času, dorazte! Příští Virtuální Bastlírna se pod taktovkou projektu MacGyver studentského klubu SiliconHill bude konat v úterý 7. března od 20:00 minimálně do 22:00 (ale obvykle končí o dost později). Odkaz na konferenci se před samotnou akcí objeví na bastlířské wiki.]]></summary>

If you're a fan of games like Super Mario Kart, Super Mario All-Stars, and Pilotwings, then you may have heard of Soyo Oka, a composer who worked with Nintendo from 1987 to 1995.
Even if you're not aware of her by name, you will have no doubt heard a number of her more famous tracks, including Mario Circuit and Rainbow Road. She continued to work on music over the years after her departure from Nintendo and has now launched a new chiptune album called LOOP816, which definitely harkens back to her work on key Nintendo titles.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recon Mission
This weekend saw the unearthing of a rumor that Valve may be gearing up to release a new edition of its popular tactical shooter Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO), and perhaps even release this supposed surprise title as soon as the coming weeks/months.
The news comes from veteran CS:GO leaker and esports journalist Richard Lewis, who noticed that the latest updates for NVIDIA graphics cards feature item entries for "CSGOS2" and "Counter-Strike 2". The items, which were initially dug up by community member @aquaismissing, suggest that a potential new title is prepped to make an appearance in the very near future. Leading many to assume that a sequel to the 2012 release is locked, loaded, and preparing to open fire in the very near future.
https://twitter.com/aquaismissing/status/1631087468366659584?s=20
However, @aquaismissing poses a far simpler and more believable theory: that Valve is simply preparing to release an updated, Source 2 edition of the now 11-year-old shooter, complete with better connectivity, modern servers, a tauter engine, and perhaps even improved visuals and textures. As such, it seems more likely that it is an updated version of the original game that is being prepared for release — similar to Ubisoft updating Rainbow Six Siege for Gen 9 platforms — rather than a straight, ground-up sequel to the popular competitive shooter
We'll be sure to keep you updated once the official word is forthcoming from Valve.

Decidueye is going to be the next 7-Star Tera Raid reward in Pokémon Scarlet & Violet. Announced by the official Japanese Pokémon Twitter account (via Serebii), the Gen 7 starter will be available in-game between 17th and 19th March, and again from 24th to 26th March.
The Arrow Quill Pokémon follows from the Pokémon Day Pikachu as the next 7-Star Raid, meaning it'll be tough to get your hands on. It will have the Mightiest Mark, and it will be a Flying Tera Type. Like all 7-Star Tera Raid Pokémon, you'll only be able to catch this one once.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rock the Dragon
There was a pretty big surprise for all Senzu Bean lovers this weekend, as Bandai Namco dropped a reveal for a brand new title in the dormant fighting game series Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi. The new title did not receive an official title, release date, or platform reveal, but we did get a brief teaser.
The short, one-minute teaser features footage from some classic Budokai Tenkaichi titles being played on a CRT television, before the image blows up into fullscreen HD with protagonist Goku going Super Duper Super Saiyan, (or something). This clip is then followed by the brief message "Get Ready for Battle... A New Sparking Begins". Dragon Ball Sparking! is, of course, the series Japanese moniker.
https://twitter.com/db_eventpj_jp/status/1632519982478405633?s=20
Originally developed by Spike Chunsoft and launched on the PS2 platform back in 2005, Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi was the first modernized fighting game set within the legendary anime universe, and saw a roster of familiar heroes and villains going at it on a unique 3D plane, replicating the hyper-dynamic look of the show. The game would receive two sequels and several spin-offs, the latest release being 2012's Dragon Ball Z: For Kinect. The series would essentially be superseded by the fantastic Arc System Works fighter Dragon Ball FighterZ, though die-hard fans have clamored for its return.
The new Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi is currently in development at Bandai Namco.

While the official Universal website for the UK still suggests that the Mario Movie is set to release on the 7th, the studio's Twitter account was on hand to put the discussion to rest.

After a few weeks of digital exclusivity on the Nintendo Switch, Metroid Prime Remastered has finally landed in retail stores across the UK.
Although the release wasn't quite enough to knock Hogwarts Legacy off its throne, Retro Studios' shooter managed to take the silver, selling around half of what the original managed back in 2003. According to Chris Dring from Games Industry, this also makes Metroid Prime Remastered the fourth biggest boxed launch of the entire franchise.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Chocks Away!
A Namco rarity is joining the Arcade Archives this week, as Hamster reaches deep into its big bag of obscurities and pulls out Japan-only shmup sequel Sky Kid Deluxe, now available to download on PS4 and Nintendo Switch.
Released to the arcade market in 1986, Sky Kid Deluxe is was debuted on Namco's all-new System 86 hardware. Like its predecessor, the simplistic shmup features dogfighting action between a battalion of biplanes. The player is armed with a machine gun for sky-to-sky action, and bombs to take out battleships and other enemies lurking on land. Curiously for the genre, the horizon scrolls from left-to-right, rather than right-to-left, which is unique, but feels extremely weird given the (literal) direction the genre would take. The Deluxe edition also features alternate colors, weather effects, and new enemies.
You can check out the action in the video below, courtesy of YouTuber Were1974.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nyEeHx4i4s&ab_channel=Were1974
Unfortunately for Sky Kid Deluxe, it launched at a time of a genre renaissance, with the arrival of a plethora of great, groundbreaking shmups such as R-Type, Gradius, 1942, Parodius, and many others. As such, Sky Kid Deluxe looked, (and played), pretty much archaic in comparison and would only perform modestly in Japan. Namco would choose not to port the sequel overseas, and it would not receive an official release in the west until its inclusion in the Namco Museum Virtual Arcade release in 2008.
Sky Kid Deluxe is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at around $8. The original Sky Kid is also available as part of the Arcade Archives range.

I come from an era of gaming where updates didn't exist. If a game was bad or broken when the cartridge hit store shelves, there was no fixing it.

Today, updates are expected, whether it's a day-one patch that developers have to crunch to get out or that thing where Nintendo withholds completed content from its sports games to add them in as updates later. While we old-timers may lament the era of gaming where everything worked at launch, the truth is I have no idea where this industry would be without them.

It has been five long years since the release of Square Enix's fantastic, multi-pronged RPG Octopath Traveler on Switch. Starting as a console exclusive on Switch before branching out onto other platforms, the game gave us eight different storylines to dive into, a range of protagonists to fall in love with, and even kicked off the HD-2D art wave that we have since seen in titles such as Triangle Strategy and Live A Live.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The 128 GB stays where it is, though
Meta is dropping the cost of some of its virtual reality headsets, though one is staying right where it's at. The 256 GB Meta Quest 2 and the newer Meta Quest Pro VR headsets are both seeing price cuts.
In a blog, Meta confirms the 256 GB Meta Quest 2 is dropping from $499.99 to $429.99. That price cut won't be spiralling down to the lower-capacity 128 GB Meta Quest 2, which still sits at $399.99.
The Meta Quest Pro sees a deeper cut, dropping from $1,499.99 to $999.99. The changes will take place on March 5 for both US and Canada.
Meta says it's goal "has always been to create hardware that's affordable for as many people as possible to take advantage of all that VR has to offer." Though the 128 GB isn't dropping in price, the company says the lowered prices on both 256 GB and Quest Pro will make them more available.

The price of virtual reality
Meta Quest 2 headsets saw a price hike last year, when the company bumped the price of both the 128 GB and 256 GB models up by $100. When the Quest 2 launched in 2020, its wireless format, internal hardware, and price point all made for a very solid entry point into virtual reality.
That changed with the price shift though, and I don't think the cut back down on the 256 GB model changes that. Especially for PlayStation 5 owners, who now have a shiny new headset option that's in a similar price range.
What's surprising to me here is the price cut on the Meta Quest Pro headset. A $500 price cut on a headset that debuted less than a year ago feels drastic. Granted, reviews of the headset weren't all glowing, and with a big price point like that, there may still be some hesitancy to buy into the newer of Meta's headsets.

This is what happens when you allow something to bake to completion, something that Street Fighter V was most definitely not allowed to do by its fateful launch.

The popular online multiplayer game Warframe is getting its next big piece of content next month. The Duviri Paradox expansion for Warframe arrives in April, bringing its own style of experience to the sci-fi game.
As premiered during today's March Devstream, a teaser showed off some more of the theme and vibe for The Duviri Paradox. The story follows the Drifter, stuck in a shifting and changing world, going up against the Child King ruler Dominus Thrax.
Publisher and developer Digital Extremes is billing this as a roguelike-inspired Open World experience, which will be accessible to both new and old players. You can get a glimpse of what that looks like here:

Expanding on everything that made Battle Clash great, Metal Combat: Falcon’s Revenge is a sequel in everything but name. I have no idea why. It’s not that Battle Clash is a great name, but changing the brand and then attaching a subtitle makes it sound unrelated. I guess we should be happy that they didn’t change over to the Japanese nomenclature for Battle Clash. They called it Space Bazooka. That’s just what I’d call the Super Scope if I was trying to make fun of it.
If you didn’t read my article last week, Battle Clash was a game for Nintendo’s space bazooka, the Super Scope. Nintendo decided to follow up the success of their ubiquitous NES Zapper by severely overcompensating. The Super Scope was absolutely a space bazooka.

Epic Games has revealed the next title that it will be offering up to its customers free of charge over on the Epic Games Store — A delightful choice this time around, users will be able to pick up Raw Fury's period piece adventure Call of the Sea from March 9, for the grand price of Nothing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w39ml-My7qM&ab_channel=Xbox
Developed by Out of the Blue and released in December 2020, Call of the Sea is a narrative-driven, first-person puzzle adventure, set against the fashion-forward backdrop of the 1930s. Players pick up the role of Norah Everhart, who ventures into a mysterious, uncharted island in the South Pacific in order to locate her husband Harry, who has vanished while on an expedition to uncover a life-changing new medicine.
As Norah explores the island, she will meet a party of strangers — friendly or otherwise — solve puzzles, negotiate traps, and piece together the mysteries of the island, its inhabitants, and the fate of her beloved. With luscious, classic comic artwork, a heartfelt narrative, and some pretty durn tricky, (borderline obtuse), puzzles, Call of the Sea is well worth a look for any puzzle adventure, and could prove to be a fine way to while away a coming weekend or two.
Oh, and be sure to check out our own CJ Andriessen's review.
Call of the Sea will be available to download from Epic Games Store from March 9 until March 16. Until then, players still have the opportunity to bag current freebie Rise of Industry, before its removal on Wednesday.

Still, this is a very reasonable price for a memory card that's good for up to 130MB/s sequential reads and meets the A2 requirements for random performance.

The critically acclaimed, and multi-award-winning fantasy adventure is nominated in the majority of the year's categories, including Best Technical Achievement, Narrative, Music, Multiplayer, Game Design, Artistic Achievement, and, of course, Best Game. Additionally, Christopher Judge is up for Performer in a Leading Role for his portrayal of Kratos, while Danielle Bisutti is nominated in the Performer in a Supporting Role category for her portrayal of the troubled witch, Freya. It seems highly unlikely that the smash-seller will not walk away without a fistful of gongs — at the very least — come the big night.
Aside from the God of War Ragnarok nomination sweep, plenty of great releases from 2022 are also hoping to take home a coveted BAFTA award. Titles such as FromSoftware's Elden Ring, Guerilla Games' Horizon Forbidden West, Team Asobo's A Plague Tale: Requiem, and Annapurna Interactive's Stray have also all received nominations, alongside smaller-sized hits including Half Mermaid's FMV mystery Immortality, Finji's Tunic, Massive Monster's Cult of the Lamb, and Poncle's compelling mobile title Vampire Survivors.
The BAFTA ceremony will take place on March 30.
You can check out the full list of categories and nominations over on the official BAFTA website.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yosuke Matsuda, president and representative director of Square Enix, is stepping down after 10 years in the position. 
The official announcement states that he’ll be replaced by the relatively new Takahashi Kiryu, a company director who joined Square in 2020, as part of an organizational restructuring. The proposed change will be voted for approval at the 43rd Annual Shareholder’s Meeting in June. Square Enix’s reason for the change is as follows:
Matsuda became president in 2013, succeeding Yoichi Wada as part of a massive restructuring. His time at the top could be viewed as a bit of a rollercoaster. He pushed for innovation in Square’s flagship franchise, Final Fantasy, and voiced commitment to remaking and re-releasing popular titles from Square’s back catalog, such as Final Fantasy VII. The MMO Final Fantasy XIV also became a global phenomenon under his watch, though the company as a whole has largely struggled to land a massive success outside of the franchise. In recent years, high-profile Square Enix-published titles such as Marvel’s Avengers and Babylon’s Fall had disappoitning releases, with the former ceasing development this year and the latter shutting down this week. 
Perhaps most infamously, Matsuda was also at the front of Square’s tumultuous relationships with its North American third-party publishers, namely Crystal Dynamics and Eidos Montreal, whose titles such as the Tomb Raider reboot trilogy, Deus Ex, and Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy were often deemed commercial disappointments. That came to a head last May, when Square Enix sold off these studios and their IPs to Embracer Group.
In recent times, Matsuda was also a vocal advocate for NFTs and blockchain gaming. In January, he published a letter detailing upcoming company initiatives, including making games that incorporate blockchain technology.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A look at who's taking up Ash's mantle
The next step in the Pokemon animated series is on its way. With the latest trailer, we're getting a look at the new series leads that are taking up the mantle.
Liko and Roy look like our two new leads, each with a mysterious new artifact. Liko carries a strange pendant, while Roy has an oddly designed PokeBall. I imagine the series will probably highlight their search to uncover the meaning behind both of them.
We also have Friede and my personal new favorite character, Captain Pikachu. If you were worried that Ash's impending retirement would mean less Pikachu, that does not seem to be the case. We even get a Pikachu with a cool hat!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAav4UAT7zk
Paldean starters Fuecoco, Sprigatito, and Quaxley all make an appearance here too; it looks like Sprigatito is Liko's Pokemon, while Roy has Fuecoco. Also spied in today's trailer: Fride on a Charizard, a Cerueledge, and an Oshawott just hanging out in the background of one shot. Rad!
Setting off on a new journey
Following after Ash's big championship win, this new series will see the longtime protagonist hang up his hat and let a new batch of eternally-young Trainers take the lead. It's a pretty big step, considering how Ash has been at the center of the Pokemon animated series for quite a long time.
It leaves a lot of weight on this special to deliver, but I'm keen to see how the show evolves with Liko and Roy in the lead. The new series premieres in Japan on April 14 with an hour-long special.
Meanwhile, if you're keen for more in the world of Pokemon Scarlet and Violet, there's plenty on the way this year. The Pokemon Company recently confirmed two pieces of DLC are scheduled for this year, with one arriving in the fall and the second arriving winter 2023.

You really should go read it.
But I'm a little more interested in something Yoshida said in an interview with Gematsu. During that interview, Gematsu's Sal Romano asked whether or not FFXVI would feature any lighter diversions from the seemingly quite heavy main storyline—something like Final Fantasy X's blitzball.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Call of Duty remains the key factor in deal completion
According to global news conglomerate Reuters, the European Commission is considered likely to approve the acquisition of publisher Activision Blizzard by Microsoft. The regulatory body held a hearing over the stalemate sale last week, where Microsoft pleaded its case for the $69 billion purchase.
Citing anonymous sources, Reuters reports that the EU commission is satisfied with Microsoft's promise to leave Activision's military shooter franchise Call of Duty as a multiplatform IP, rather than make the billion-dollar series an exclusive for Microsoft's own Xbox platform. While there are many factors pertaining to the sale — from a company, franchise, division, and employee standpoint — Call of Duty and its future remains one of the key elements on which the entire purchase rests.
"[Microsoft is] committed to offering effective  and  easily  enforceable solutions  that address the European Commission's concerns," said the publisher in comments to Reuters. "Our commitment to grant long-term 100% equal access to Call of Duty to Sony, Steam,  NVIDIA, and others  preserves the deal's benefits to gamers and developers and increases competition in the market."
Regardless of the EU's final decision, which must be disclosed before April 25, 2023, Microsoft still has to face down a lawsuit from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, which is scheduled to go to trial this summer. The losing party will also have the right to appeal, essentially setting the tone for a long and extremely drawn-out process before the acquisition is finally settled, one way or another.

Footage from the open-world skateboarders’ playtest leaked last September, and EA have since responded by releasing their own janky videos. These clips give us a taste of the whacky ragdolling happening right now, and it's probably the most entertaining way of marketing a game while simultaneously sucking the air out of leaks.

It's not that I dislike them. They've just never really made much impression (possibly because I don't see all that many)
Destructure blends in a hint of shooting, resource management, and leans into the sheer fun of destruction, replacing bricks with "structures" that aren't meant to be anything specific, but give the whole feeling an impression of combat, an assault you're carrying out rather than a reacting, abstract geometry game.
Also it feels and sounds great to hit stuff. That's probably the bigger reason.

It's been 15 years since I last visited family in Yokohama, and my last memory is one where I'm miserable and I'm staring out of a cab window going back to the airport. I didn't want to leave. It sounds corny as heck, but I can't wait to sucker punch that memory with a swing that's been building for 5478 days, then jab it full of happy ones. Really, I imagine what will happen is I'll get weirdly emotional as the plane touches down and my mate Simon, who I'm going with, will be like, "Get a hold of yourself you buffoon".
I got LINE recently -  a Whatsapp equivalent that's big in Japan - to arrange some meetups with friends and family. Those arrangements have happened, which brings me great joy. But in a surprise plot twist, it meant I got back in touch with a guy called Sam. Now Sam, he's a good bud and we go a long way back. All the way back to the original Gears Of War days. And I think we've arranged, as is custom, to play Gears 6 whenever it arrives. Such is the bizarre way of things.

It was an insightful look at the nuts and bolts of game dev, so I’m glad Ninja Theory are returning to the concept for the spooky action sequel Hellblade 2: Senua’s Saga. The first episode takes a look at Iceland - the sequel's setting - and the team's painstaking commitment to recreating it as realistically as possible. The photogrammartry tech on display is seriously impressive, and following the team to Iceland feels like watching a British travel series, without the crude humour.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Pokémon Company has released a new teaser trailer for its upcoming Pokémon reboot. 
The Pokémon Company revealed back in December that the long-running Pokémon anime starring Ash Ketchum and his Pikachu would be coming to an end soon, set to be replaced by a new Pokémon anime with two new protagonists. The Pokémon Company has released a new trailer that reveals these two new main characters are Loko, "the girl with the awe-inspiring pendant," and Roy, "the boy with the mysterious Poké Ball." Plus, we get another look at Friede, who is the Professor of this anime, alongside Captain Pikachu.

The trailer above also reveals that this new Pokémon anime will debut in Japan with an hour-long special on April 14. As for the rest of the world, the release remains unknown but the trailer does say 2023 and beyond so hopefully sometime this year. 
Here's another look at the three characters introduced in today's trailer: 

Strangely, this trailer wasn't released during the Pokémon Day showcase, which aired earlier this week. There, The Pokémon Company announced a new stop-motion animation series coming to Netflix, Pokémon Scarlet and Violet DLC, a re-reveal of Pokémon Sleep, and more.

A lengthy personal essay about an attract mode clip? Can my cat get a review? First off, yes. Captain Waffles is a visceral tour-de-force that no fan of the genre should miss. 10/10. Secondly, you should know that Immortal Empires is, as far as Total War: Warhammer goes, the game mode. More importantly, this ridiculously expansive, years-spanning grand-strategy project exists as tangible proof that sometimes, the limitless hubris of man is actually rad as hell, despite what the ancient Greeks said. Euripides nuts, more like.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo has revealed that Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscribers can jump into Metroid Fusion when the game is added to the NSO library on March 8. 
After surprise releasing Metroid Prime Remastered last month, Metroid fans have another game from the series' history to play through, this time in the Game Boy Advance game first released in 2002. Once Fusion is live with NSO, players can finally experience Samus Aran's full 2D series journey on the Nintendo Switch, starting with the original Metroid game all the way through Metroid Fusion and 2021's Metroid Dread. 
Check out the Metroid Fusion Nintendo Switch Online trailer announcing the news below: 


"In Metroid Fusion, interstellar bounty hunter Samus Aran is attacked by an X parasite while exploring the mysterious planet SR388," Nintendo's description of the game reads. "This organism is not only deadly, but it can mimic the abilities of any creature it infects – including Samus herself! Saved from the brink thanks to an infusion of Metroid DNA, the X parasite's only natural predator, she soon discovers that the parasite has spread to the research station orbiting SR388. Weakened and out of options, Samus must do whatever it takes to destroy the X threat before it's too late." 
Nintendo says Metroid Fusion contains "a multitude of secrets" for players to experience that links Super Metroid to Metroid Dread. 
Speaking of Metroid Dread, read Game Informer's review of it to find out why it was one of our favorite games of 2021, and then read Game Informer's Metroid Prime Remastered review. Check out our list of every NES, SNES, Game Boy, N64, Sega Genesis, and GBA game on Nintendo Switch Online after that. 
Metroid Fusion hits Nintendo Switch Online next week on March 8.

The two production companies involved are longtime horror fixtures Atomic Monster (who have made The Conjuring, Annabelle, and Malignant) and Blumhouse (the company behind Paranormal Activity, M3GAN, and Get Out.) The film doesn’t have any talent attached right now, but the two companies are currently looking for a director and a screenwriter. Blumhouse says, "it’s imperative we find someone who appreciates and loves the world as much as we do, to help us bring the game to the big screen".

Judging from the manual it supports the very latest socket types for Intel and AMD’s gaming CPUs, and being under the Amazon Basics brand, it's dirt cheap at £21 / £27. 
It’s unlikely, though, that Bezos and the gang have been secretly funding R&D into an all-new line of PC gear. As Tom’s Hardware spotted, the Amazon Basics Computer Cooling Fan appears to simply be an existing budget cooler, the Cooler Master Hyper H410R, without the CM badge.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The overlap of Powerwash Simulator fans and Final Fantasy VII diehards hits in full force today, thanks to the launch of a free DLC pack for the popular sim. You can use your high-pressure hose to blast dirt and grime off of popular locations in Midgar, and the best part is that the experience is totally free.
The Midgar Special Pack is available now for all versions of Powerwash Simulator. It adds five new levels, including Tifa’s Seventh Heaven bar and the Mako Energy Exhibit. Additionally, you’ll be cleaning up vehicles and mechs such as Cloud’s Hardy-Daytona motorcycle, Shinra Hauler, the Scorpion Sentinal, and the Airbuster. The pack also adds new dirt types, such as bio-residue. 


This DLC was created in collaboration with Square Enix, with Final Fantasy VII Remake director Tetsuya Nomura writing in a press release, 
“When I heard about the proposal for a collab, I was quite busy with various other collabs and reviews, but I was especially excited about this one. I had just been playing PowerWash Simulator and was daydreaming about cleaning things from my titles. My immediate response was, 'let’s wash the entire Shinra building.' Unfortunately, that seemed to be a bit difficult, but the final line-up is exciting, nonetheless. This is something I have been looking forward to a lot, and hope everyone has a great time!”
This pack follows a Tomb Raider-themed expansion that launched in January. This is a pretty neat trend, and see other video game properties added to the game that are in need of good clean-up. 
Powerwash Simulator is available now for PlayStation and Xbox consoles, Switch, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Alienware AW3423DWF is a monitor we've talked about a few times, as this 34-in ultrawide QD-OLED manages to outperform almost everything else on the market - albeit with a four-figure price tag that also eclipses almost every alternative. 
Now though, this 3440x1440 165Hz gaming OLED has dropped in price by a sizeable 26% or £310. That brings the monitor well into three-figure territory at £880, still pricy but a reasonable value given that this Dell monitor is head and shoulders above its IPS, VA and TN opponents.

More specifically, the showcase will air at 9 a.m. PT on March 7 and during it, Panic will reveal new Playdate games and more. The presentation will run for 13 minutes and will also include an update on Catalog, which is Panic's "own curated, on-device and web browser storefront for Playdate software." 
For the uninitiated, Playdate is a piece of handheld hardware that began shipping to customers in April of last year. It's a small device with a black and white screen and a unique crank on the side of it. This crank is integrated into many of the games you can play with it.
Since last April, more than 25,000 Playdate units have shipped to customers. Playdate is not yet availabe on demand for would-be purchasers but you can preorder the device to receive one in the next wave. 
The Playdate Update showcase will air on the official Panic YouTube channel.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Somehow, it's been almost a decade since the last numbered Age Of Wonders game. Despite dipping their toes into the sci-fi realm with Age Of Wonders: Planetfall three-odd years ago, developers Triumph are now returning to their fantastical 4X strategy roots with Age Of Wonders 4, due out on PC in just a couple of months on May 2nd - and what a homecoming it's shaping up to be. I've spent the better part of a week and half playing an early build of AOW 4, getting to grips with its enormous array of customizable factions and hero types in its generous crop of single-player realm maps. 


There's a heck of a lot to get through, but rest assured: this is Age Of Wonders through and through - and thanks to the addition of those new, customizable factions, it's also the most RPG-like entry yet, which is good news for budding D&D-ers looking for a grand, 4X strategy game to sink their teeth into. Heck, I'd even go as far as saying it could be one of this year's biggest and most exciting fantasy games outside of Baldur's Gate 3.

A few snippets of gameplay at the end of the trailer revealed speedy action against giant beasts and a semi-open world desert you can slide across - and who doesn’t love sliding in games? We now know when to expect developer Deck13’s latest, as the team have announced a May 16th date for PC and consoles. Publisher Focus Entertainment say a gameplay reveal trailer is “coming soon”, but for now we can enjoy a couple of new screenshots.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Given that Dead Island 2 has been in development for the better part of a decade, it’s understandable to have some trepidation about its quality (and general existence). Developer Dambuster Studios hopes to convince players that Dead Island 2 is not only close to finished but is a worthy follow-up by releasing an extended gameplay walkthrough that provides the rawest look at its action. 
The guided demo follows Irish punk rocker Dani, one of the game's six playable characters, and shows off a lot of the moment-to-moment action across various locales. The gory F.L.E.S.H. system is on full display, as is the wacky makeshift weaponry, including electrified Wolverine-esque claws. We also get a look at the card-based perk system and one strange sidequest involving pizza. 


Dead Island is slated to launch on April 21 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. We recently featured the game on our cover and you check out a month’s worth of exclusive features by visiting our coverage hub.]]></summary>

The 17 minute long video showcased various sections from the game, including a late-game boss fight and a greatly expanded early area that sees Leon exploring a series of creepy caves.


As Rock Paper Shotgun's Resident Resident Evil Liker, I took it upon myself to obsessively study each individual frame of this video file to uncover its hidden secrets. Surprising even myself, I was able to extract 17 new details about Leon's refreshed holiday to rural Spain. That's one new thing for each minute of the footage! That wasn't intentional! What a pleasing coincidence!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Star Wars Jedi: Survivor director Stig Asmussen of Respawn Entertainment wants the series to be a trilogy. 
This news comes from a new IGN Unfiltered interview with the director, which is where Asmussen revealed that even before the release of Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order in 2019, the team was already discussing sequel ideas. For Asmussen, Cal's story has always been a trilogy in his head. 
"We were already talking about the second game," said Asmussen. "I mean, frankly, we were talking beyond. And these are conversations that, when we're breaking this story with Lucasfilm, it's like: 'Well, where are we going with the second game?' I always wanted to see this as a trilogy. How can we take Cal and the crew to new places beyond what we were doing in the first game." 
Asmussen continues, stating that Respawn had a good idea of where Survivor, which is due out April 28, takes place in terms of the Star Wars timeline. The team also knew what the stakes were going to be, what the tone was going to be, what Cal was going to be up against, and how his crew was going to be factored into all of that. On top of that, Respawn thinks about the ideas "that we could do beyond that as well." 
Star Wars Jedi: Survivor was originally due out March 17, but was delayed to April 28. While waiting to get your hands on the game, watch Game Informer's interview with Cal Kestis actor Cameron Monaghan, and then check out our exclusive preview of Star Wars Jedi: Survivor for new details about the story, exploration, and combat.

I'm not the new one in sheep’s clothing, because they haven’t released anything yet. Like many, I was especially drawn to The Wolf Among Us, a neo-noir murder mystery set in the same universe as the Fables graphic novels. It would have been quite poetic to return to the series ten years after its debut, but that’s not going to be paw-sibble, as new TellTale have announced that The Wolf Among Us 2 has been delayed out of 2023. There’s no new release window, but maybe it'll be ready in 2024. Hopefully.

But I think Wo Long is Team Ninja having sanded off some - not all - of the edges from the overwhelmingly complex Nioh, to craft an action RPG with even crisper combat than its predecessor. And crucially, it's more approachable as a result. Clever ranks and meters reward, whether risk-taking is your jam or you're more of a careful type. It may still be a tricky venture filled with demonic, titanic cows that'll want to pound your skull into the dirt, but this is Team Ninja's most encouraging effort yet.

Team Ninja has earned a reputation for crafting some of the most satisfying action games around, nimbly transitioning from the high-octane action Ninja Gaiden series to the Soulslike thrills of Nioh. Its latest effort, Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty, is an unforgiving but deeply rewarding showcase of freneticism that lives up to this lineage. The smooth swordplay, brilliant boss fights, and novel systems further prove Team Ninja’s ability to craft unrelenting experiences. Although its back half is hampered by a lack of enemy variety, its lightni…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At first glance, King Of The Castle might look similar to other medieval political sims; something like Reigns or Yes, Your Grace, where you ascend the throne, rule a kingdom, and make decisions that will impact your gold reserves, military strength, or alliances. That political manoeuvring is intact in King Of The Castle, but this time up to 24 of your friends (or thousands of Twitch viewers) can join your campaign, hopping into the shoes of nobles from various regions. All of them have different goals, all of them can vote on certain decisions, and all of them have the potential to support or backstab the all-powerful monarch: you.

        <updated>2023-03-01T20:44:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony has announced a new collaborative initiative called PlayStation PlayMakers. The console giant will partner up with celebrity fans of the brand to “celebrate their passion for gaming and PlayStation” by creating unique experiences for players. One of those famous names is NBA superstar LeBron James, who helped design a limited-edition PlayStation 5 accessories.
The special console plates and DualSense 5 controller were co-designed by James and will release in select countries. The hardware is adorned with artistic elements (including obligatory crowns) and personal inspirational messages by LeBron. There’s no word yet on the prices, but you can only pre-order these items through direct.playstation.com. sometime this year. You can read LeBron's thoughts on the project by visiting the PlayStation Blog. 
Other big names involved with PlayStation PlayMakers include country music star Jimmie Allen, actor and comedian King Bach, and other professional athletes such as BMX’s Nigel Sylvester, WNBA All-Rookie NaLyssa Smith, NFL stars Ja’Marr Chase and CeeDee Lamb, French football freestyler Lisa Zimouche, and Belgian football star Romelu Lukaku. The initiative feels similar to McDonald's recent push of celebrity-branded menu items, so who knows what to expect from these names and others in the future.
Are you interested in grabbing LeBron James PlayStation 5 merch? Let us know in the comments!
Editors Note: a previous version of the article incorrectly stated that Sony revealed a LeBron James PS5 console instead of console accessories. We've updated the article with the correction.]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-03-01T20:07:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Telltale Games has announced that The Wolf Among Us 2 has been delayed and will now arrive in 2024. In a statement to IGN, the team explains it wants to avoid crunching the team and releasing an unfinished product as it moves development into Unreal Engine 5.
Telltale released a brief message on Twitter announcing the delay, but CEO Jamie Ottilie shares more context with IGN. Ottilie discusses the challenges of relaunching the studio in 2019, which were then compounded when the COVID-19 pandemic began the following year. That includes announcing the game when the studio was still staffing up to help secure early funding. Despite those early hurdles, Ottilie states that development has been going well since then, but the team recently decided it wants to adopt Unreal 5 to take advantage of the engine’s new features. Unfortunately, that meant having to redo a lot of the work that had been created in Unreal 4.
With such a big change, Ottilie explains that the only way The Wolf Among Us 2 could still arrive this year would be either to launch it in a less-polished state (which the team wants to avoid given its high expectations) or to overwork the staff. Given that the old Telltale was infamous for crunch and burnout, Ottilie is adamant about avoiding the same practice with this iteration of the studio. 
"I've done [crunch], and I don't want to do it again, and it's not fair to ask it," Ottilie tells IGN. "You can't plan a business around it. So yeah, part of it is about maintaining a healthy work culture. We don't want to burn out our good people.”
The Wolf Among Us 2 was announced at the 2019 Game Awards and will be an episodic title like its predecessor. However, Telltale is developing each episode at the same time, so the entire series will be complete when the first installment launches. You can watch the first full trailer from last year here. The studio’s other project, The Expanse: A Telltale Series, is still slated for this year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[“I was deranged,” says Half-Life writer Marc Laidlaw of his decision to publish the plot of Episode 3 as fanfiction. “I was living on an island, totally cut off from my friends and creative community of the last couple decades, I was completely out of touch and had nobody to talk me out of it. It just seemed like a fun thing to do… until I did it.” 


Laidlaw first discovered that community in the mid 90s, in the office of Valve, where Gabe Newell and team were already hard at work on Half-Life. “I’d seen bits and pieces of the levels they were working on, but as soon as I heard the name, I just got this amazing buzz,” Laidlaw says. “I could see the whole world they were aiming at somehow, and I felt it was a collective vision. This is one reason it’s so weird to me when people try to attribute authorship to me that I’ve never felt. It was all there when I got there, in embryo.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's a sometimes hard to define line between a game that effectively establishes and embellishes its fiction (good, righteous), and one that has "lore" (tedious, lowly). It's a delicate art that warrants close consideration. It also warrants some good examples, which brings us to ΔV: Rings Of Saturn. Which, as it gets closer to release, I'm going to be nice to and call either Delta V or Rings Of Saturn. Even though Triangle Vee Colon Rings is more fun.
It's also fun, having played it, to keep up with how it’s doing in early access, not just because I'm looking forward to seeing it take off, but because its dev has spent the last few years writing delightful patch notes in the style of in-world news bulletins.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Deck 13, makers of The Surge and Lords of the Fallen, have announced their next big action RPG, Atlas Fallen, launches in May. The game was revealed during last year’s Gamescom and centers on players manipulating sand to explore and survive in a fantastical desert world.  
The game supports single-player and two-player co-op and takes place in a massive sand-covered world filled with monsters and gods. You’ll take them down using shape-shifting weapons born out of the sand and other customizable magical abilities. You can check out the cinematic announcement trailer from Gamescom 2022, and a batch of new screenshots, below. 


                  

Atlas Fallen will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.]]></summary>

The world’s five explorable regions – Kehjistan, Scosglen, Fractured Peaks, Dry Steppes, and Hawezar – offer their own flavors of topography, cultures, quests, and, of course, monsters. Blizzard is going to great lengths to ensure these regions are not only fun for players to explore, but feature more narrative cohesion and a stronger sense of place. 
Diablo veterans have explored regions of Sanctuary before, but this time they’re more than one-note areas highlighting a single climate or element, such as snow or desert. Each of them is biodiverse in its own right, with multiple biomes and threats exclusive to them. These realms also blend more naturally together; the lush green of one area gradually withers…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Electronic Arts has reportedly laid off more than 200 quality assurance testers at its Baton Rouge office in Lousiana. 
This news comes by way of Kotaku, which reports that EA laid off these workers, who worked primarily on the publisher's battle royale Apex Legends, during a surprise Zoom call yesterday. The publication reports that its three sources were able to confirm the news, which began making rounds on Twitter when both current and former QA testers at the Lousiana office began to share what they had learned. 
EA just fired its entire Baton Rouge studio, which is essentially their entire Apex Legends QA staff.
February 28, 2023
Kotaku reports that around 8 a.m. CT, QA testers were invited to an unscheduled but mandatory Zoom call with Magnit Global, which is the contract agency that manages the workers. It was during this meeting that the entire QA team at the Lousiana office was "disbanded," according to Kotaku. 
The publication reached out to EA looking for a response to the mass layoffs, but the publisher opted not to directly address it, instead stating that as "part of its ongoing global strategy, we are expanding the distribution of our Apex Legends testing team and ending execution that's been concentrated in Baton Rouge, Lousiana, impacting services provided by our third-party provider." Be sure to check out Kotaku's write-up for the full statement from EA and additional context surrounding the layoffs, the Lousiana office, and more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the best things a survival game can do is make you want to share your latest experiences with your family and friends At this, Sons Of The Forest succeeds in grand fashion. Often I found myself pausing the game so I could go find my brother and tell him about the latest Big Thing that had just happened. Some of the time, it's even for the right reasons. Perhaps I'd spotted a group of cannibals adopting some startlingly intelligent behaviour. Or maybe one of my NPC companions had just done something particularly endearing in front of me.
Or, more likely, I'd witnessed another example of the incredible jankiness which, like the island's flesh-nibbling denizens, loves to raid and pillage its way through nearly every aspect of the game. Perhaps I'd just cut down a tree and watched it soar high into the air, glitching all over the place like some demonic new type of tree mutant. Maybe Kelvin had just taken my instruction to gather logs a bit too literally, and deconstructed the entire west side of my house while I wasn't looking.
Sons Of The Forest's great strength is its ability to utterly transport you into its threatening, unsettling, but genuinely beautiful world. It quickly builds up the player's trust until they're ready to wholeheartedly buy into what at times feels like the next generation of open-world survival and crafting games. But then, at least in its current Early Access state, it breaks that trust just as quickly with a melange of unintuitive systems, game-breaking bugs, and a painful lack of content that makes one of the most gorgeous environments in games feel awfully hollow after a while.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you’ve paid any attention at all to Final Fantasy XVI, you likely already know how action-forward this game is. It’s easily the farthest a mainline Final Fantasy game has ever been from its traditional turn-based roots, with FFXVI being easily the most action-heavy yet. That’s not surprising, though, considering the game’s combat director is Ryota Suzuki, a former Capcom developer with nearly 20 years of experience designing the action in games like Marvel vs. Capcom 2, Devil May Cry 4, and most recently, Devil May Cry 5. 
With such a personal connection to Devil May Cry, I couldn’t resist asking: Who would win in a one-on-one fight: FFXVI protagonist Clive or Devil May Cry 5 lead Dante? Suzuki had to answer this question with two of his bosses right beside him – FFXVI director Hiroshi Takai and producer Naoki Yoshida – so perhaps we should take this answer with a grain of salt. But I don’t know, having played both Devil May Cry 5 and two hours of FFXVI during a recent hands-on preview (read about that here), I’m inclined to believe him. 
His answer, with a sly smile and a laugh: Clive. 
Suzuki says Clive’s Eikonic abilities, which allow him to tap into the power of Eikons like Phoenix and Titan, give him the ultimate edge. And just for fun, I asked who would win in a fight between Clive and Nero. 
“Clive.” 
There you have it, very specific fans of both Final Fantasy and Devil May Cry 5 like me; Clive wins.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After previewing Final Fantasy XVI for roughly two hours, which you can read about here, I’m left most interested in the different styles of combat happening throughout the game. Clive has his own style of Devil May Cry-esque combat, party members controlled by A.I. up the ante, Clive’s dog Torgal can attack enemies, Clive can fight Eikons, and there are even Eikon vs. Eikon fights. It’s a lot for one game to juggle, and after my relatively short preview, I feel that the team is confident in this balancing act. 
But I wanted to learn more, so I asked FFXVI producer Naoki Yoshida, director Hiroshi Takai, and combat director Ryota Suzuki how the team manages so many unique combat experiences.

In this specific segment, you'll see protagonist Clive exploring a castle in search of Benedikta. Along the way, Clive runs into plenty of enemies to take down, some minibosses, and one big boss at the end. Enjoy!


As you can see, Final Fantasy XVI is looking to be the most action-heavy mainline game in the series. But traditional Final Fantasy mainstays like magic, potions, and, of course, Cid are still part of the formula. For more, you can read Wesley's full Final Fantasy XVI preview thoughts here.

After nearly 20 years at Capcom working on combat for games like Marvel vs. Capcom 2, Devil May Cry 4, and most recently, Devil May Cry 5, Suzuki decided he was ready for something new. 
That "something new" turned out to be FFXVI. The game’s director, Hiroshi Takai, and its producer, Naoki Yoshida, offered Suzuki a role at Creative Business Unit III, leading FFXVI’s combat design. And now, on June 22, players will be able to feel what I felt during a recent hands-on preview of the game: it’s very Devil May Cry meets Final Fantasy, in the best way.

With each new game, the series moves further away from its classic turn-based roots toward a more action-oriented combat system. Combat has never been further from being turn-based in a Final Fantasy game more so than in Final Fantasy XVI, which is the most action-based game in the mainline franchise yet. I recently played about two hours of the game to dive deeper into the combat system’s mechanics, and you can read my preview thoughts on that here. 
But after playing some of the game, I spoke with the FFXVI producer Naoki Yoshida, director Hiroshi Takai, and combat director Ryota Suzuki about this continued shift to deep action and whether Final Fantasy will ever return to its turn-based roots. A…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm still not entirely sure if I'm playing Phantom Brigade right. According to its internal clock, battles usually take less than a minute. That time is divided into five-second chunks during which you're shown what the enemy will do, and must use that to coordinate your own mechs, placing their orders on a visible timeline. You finish your turn by hitting a button that makes everyone go at once for a few explosive moments.
In practice, behind those few seconds are an eternity of theorising, testing, and tweaking. There's probably a metaphor in there somewhere about writing, video editing, or catering. The result is a game that's taken me absolutely ages, but whose numbers suggest I'm supposed to be blasting through without a care.
I am enjoying it a lot, despite some frustration.

One facet of FFXVI’s development I was especially interested in is how Creative Business Unit III, the internal studio behind the upcoming game, is able to balance creating this new title while continuing to develop its extremely successful MMO, Final Fantasy XIV. Yoshida, who is FFXIV’s producer and director, says it’s not as different as you might think.

According to Takai, it all started with summons. 

“So when the project started, I was one of the first people that [Yoshida] came to first and he said, ‘Okay, we have this project called Final Fantasy XVI.

Star Rail's turn-based battles and JRPG leanings might be a bit of a departure from Genshin's open-world adventuring, but it's definitely, 100%, without a doubt, anime as heck. Oh, and very gacha. There's a lot of currencies. So many currencies. Still, I think it's shaping up to be a decent time.

I’ve probably waved off multiple fun secrets, mistaking them for lore I didn’t understand or a questline I haven’t gotten to. So, my pea-sized brain enjoyed this video of game designer Steve Lee interviewing the devs behind Skyrim and Fallout as they reveal some dev secrets behind those games - including a cool egg.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know we’ve been bleating on about PC system requirements lately, but the spec demands of Kerbal Space Program 2 also demand a special, visibly uncomfortable mention. This game, fresh into early access and the sequel to one that needed a mere 512GB of VRAM, lists the formidable RTX 3080 among its recommended hardware. That’s a £600-plus graphics card, and for the bare minimum of Low quality at 1080p? That’ll be either a GTX 1070 Ti or a Radeon RX 5600 XT. 


Consternation at the star-high starting specs prompted Private Division community lead Michael Loreno to pen a forum post explaining the requirements, suggesting they were subject to change as further optimisations are added and that "the game is certainly playable on machines below our min spec." Sadly, I’ve been finding that several of the most-used GPUs among Steam users – including the immensely popular GTX 1060 – are likely to face serious performance woes in KSP2’s current state.

I had a decent pot plant called James Plant back in the UK, but when I moved I bequeathed James Plant to Graham - and, now that I think about it, Graham hasn't told me how James Plant is doing, so I should probably check in on that.
I know that digital plants do not replace real plants in a physical sense - i.e. I am getting no oxygenating benefit from them - but the little plants in Garden In! make me happy. And I've just realised the name is a pun, too.

Most of that playtime consisted of me controlling Clive as I battled alongside ally Cidolfus Telamon (always a Cid, right?) through a castle dungeon. However, toward the end of my preview, I was able to fight Garuda, one of the game’s Eikons, while controlling Ifrit, another Eikon. 
At this point in the game, roughly five hours in according to FFXVI producer Naoki Yoshida, Clive has little control over Ifrit. A special few in the world of FFXVI are Dominants, meaning they can tap into the power of an Eikon and even transform into them. Cidolfus, for example, can become the Ramuh Eikon. Clive, however, is not a Domin…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following the release of Forspoken earlier this year, Square Enix has announced that the game's developer, Luminous Productions, will merge into the company. 
It's a strange announcement, given that Luminous Productions was already a studio under the Square Enix umbrella. But now, it seems that Luminous Productions as an individual entity will be no more and, thus, won't be seeing its name appear on future titles.
"The merger is part of the Company's efforts to bolster the competitive prowess of the Group's development studios, a goal set forth under its current medium-term business strategy," a press release reads. "Square Enix has developed numerous AAA high-definition (HD) games and possesses a wealth of intellectual property (IP) and content. Luminous Productions Co., Ltd. is meanwhile equipped not only with AAA title development capabilities but also technical expertise in areas such as game engine development. Combining the two entities will further enhance the Group's ability to develop HD games." 
As you can see, it's not that Luminous Productions' developers are no longer with Square Enix; it's just that the team has been merged into the wider Square Enix umbrella. As for why remains unclear. Perhaps it's the result of Forspoken's mixed reception at release, but that's speculation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are plenty of great games based on books, but I’ve never seen an adaptation as unconventional as The Forest Cathedral, a dramatic reimagining of Rachel Carson’s science book from the ‘60s, Silent Spring. Carson’s book investigated the pesticide known as DDT, its harmful environmental impacts, and the misinformation that allowed companies to indiscriminately use it. The Forest Cathedral reimagines this series of events as partly a first-person walking sim across the woods and partly a 2D platformer set inside scanning equipment. So, yeah, not exactly a one-to-one adaptation.

Since the reveal of Final Fantasy XVI in 2020, my questions about the title have continued to grow. Mind you, my questions are firmly planted in the fascination of everything surrounding this game, like how Final Fantasy XIV studio Creative Business Unit III is developing the title with Naoki Yoshida in the producer role or how former Devil May Cry 5 and Marvel vs. Capcom 2 combat designer Ryota Suzuki is the game’s lead combat director. Will FFXVI feature the storytelling prowess of FFXIV? Will its combat go full stylish action?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just a few days after the one-year anniversary of Elden Ring's release, developer From Software has revealed that an expansion for the game is currently in development. 
Revealed by the official Elden Ring Twitter account, this expansion is called Shadow of the Erdtree. Not much is known about the expansion, but those familiar with the game's lore (especially those that have completed the game) might be able to piece together what this new adventure will consist of. Alongside the news, From Software has released what appears to be a piece of concept art for the expansion. 
Check it out for yourself in the tweet below: 
Rise, Tarnished, and let us walk a new path together.
#ELDENRING Shadow of the Erdtree, is currently in development.

February 28, 2023
This is exciting news for fans of Elden Ring, but given that From Software has only revealed the expansion is in development, with no release date or window in sight, it might be a while before our return to the Lands Between. 
In the meantime, read Game Informer's Elden Ring review to find out why we gave the game a 10.

In fact, this processor is down to £177 at Amazon UK at present, meaning it's rapidly approaching half of its £329 UK RRP. 
Yes, I know the CPU pictured is the 5800X. Please don't tell anyone! I didn't think you'd look at it that closely.

This analysis and settings guide, then, is brought to you the ragged nerves of someone that’s spent several hours being screamed at by camouflaged cannibals, having only survived long enough to hear them by consuming several tins of cat food. Honestly, I am more cat food than man at this point.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Oh no, poor Kerbal Space Program 2. The extremely anticipated sequel to everyone’s favourite rocket-building space exploration game is a hot mess. A list of bugs longer than a Saturn V reads like a terrible medical diagnosis: quivering periapsis, unpredictable methane leakage, late-stage separation anxiety, loose payloads, non-stop burning, and sensitive nodes.
The developers, smiling bravely in circumstances presumably beyond their control, describe the launch as like dropping a kid off for their first day at school. Well the kid forgot their lunchbox, their uniform, their books and their pencil case. They showed up at the wrong school, on a Saturday during half-term. If you were stranded on a desert island and had to recreate Kerbal Space Program from memory using nothing but coconuts and string, it would look something like Kerbal Space Program 2. The game is nowhere approaching finished, it barely resembles the promotional videos, and it isn’t ready, even by Early Access standards.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As part of today's Pokémon Presents livestream, Netflix joined the festivities to announce Pokémon Concierge. This new animated series is the first collaborative production between Netflix and The Pokémon Company and features a decidedly different direction from previous animated adventures in the Pokémon universe. 
The narrative, which is told through stop-motion animation from Dwarf Studios, stars Haru. a concierge a the Pokémon Resort, and Psyduck. The stories that unfold center around her interactions with the various Pokémon that pass through the resort. 
"Netflix is looking forward to delighting fans in Japan and around the world with Pokémon Concierge, an entirely new visual and storytelling experience featuring groundbreaking stop-motion animation set in the Pokémon world in close collaboration with The Pokémon Company," vice president of Netflix content in Asia Minyoung Kim said in a press release. "We're also excited to reveal this new series on Pokémon Day and provide fans with even more things to look forward to on this special holiday celebrating the popular franchise."
Ever since spring 2020, Netflix has been the exclusive home to the Pokémon anime in the United States. While those seasons have continued the story of Ash Ketchum and Pikachu, Pokémon Concierge represents a completely new focus within the world of Pokémon.
We don't know much more about this new series, but we did receive a teaser trailer, which you can see below.]]></summary>

After he left Square Enix in 2003, Sakaguchi opened his own studio and worked on turn-based adventures like Blue Dragon and Lost Odyssey - games that arguably matched his genre-defining classics - but PC gamers have been largely unable to experience them, until now. Maybe. Sakaguchi recently took part in a Q&A (reported by IGN Japan, translated by VGC) where he expressed the desire to bring his Apple Arcade exclusive Fantasian to PC.

The overarching tale, which unfolds over the course of two parts, is called "The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero." The first part, titled "The Teal Mask," begins with a school trip to the land of Kitakami, which features a big mountain with people living at the base. The Pokémon Company describes Kitakami as a "place of tranquil expanses featuring rice paddles and apple orchards." While there, the students can experience a festiv…]]></summary>

It’s also an unexpected remaster, redoing and fine-tuning everything from companion AI and facial animations to weather effects and dynamic lighting. It’s an enticing prospect for a game that never previously counted visuals as its strong suit, though there will be a catch: the Spacer’s Choice Edition will have significantly higher PC system requirements than the 2019 original.

What's happened here is: I've come away with thoughts, but they're thoughts on one of three modes that's the least useful one to have thoughts on. The other two - the bulk of the game - weren't playable. Still, what I did play was simplistic fun that valued chaos over stealth, with middling results. Unless the other two modes wrap up its action in more interesting ways, I'm unsure whether I can see Crime Boss racking up the cash when it releases next month.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Most RPGs set you off on some kind of grand quest, a hero's journey filled with danger and peril as you track down some legendary sword to defeat a world-ending evil. Boots Quest DX, however, has much humbler aspirations. You are a mere boot enthusiast on an adventure to find the very bestest best boots known to man (or blobs, I genuinely can't tell what provenance these rotund creatures hail from), and nothing else will deter you from achieving your lifelong goal. Find a honking great sword on the beach? Trash. A pirate's cutlass? Get in the sea, literally. If it's not a pair of boots, you're not interested - and it all makes for a brisk, anti-RPG adventure that's incredibly refreshing.

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2023/02/24/nintendo-confirms-that-its-skipping-e3-this-year"/>
        <updated>2023-02-24T18:11:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo has confirmed that it will not participate in E3 this year. This comes in the wake of a recent report stating the three console makers plan to skip the annual event entirely this year. Sony and Microsoft have yet to confirm any formal attendance. 
In a statement to IGN, Nintendo say E3 didn’t fit into its plans but will continue to support the event alongside its organizer, the ESA. 
"We approach our involvement in any event on a case-by-case basis and are always considering various ways to engage with our fans. Since this year’s E3 show didn’t fit into our plans, we have made the decision to not participate. However, we have been and continue to be a strong supporter of the ESA and E3."
Although Nintendo was the first of the three console makers to stop holding live E3 press conferences in favor of pre-recorded Direct videos, it was also the last one to have a booth on the show floor. Up until the last traditional show in 2019, Nintendo still had a large, often elaborate area filled with demos and a stage where it broadcasted its Treehouse Live stream. Xbox moved its booth out of the convention center to the Microsoft Theater next door in 2018 (though it was still part of E3); PlayStation pulled out of the event entirely in 2019 and hasn't returned. 
E3 2023 is being organized by ReedPop, the company responsible for overseeing PAX and Star Wars Celebration. It will be the first in-person show since the 2019 edition and only the second to take place since the COVID-19 pandemic started (the 2020 and 2022 shows were completely canceled, while 2021 was a virtual event). E3 runs from June 13-16 at the Los Angeles Convention Center and will have dedicated attendance days for industry and fans. The show has no exhibitor list yet, but Ubisoft recently confirmed it will attend E3 if it happens. Xbox head Phil Spencer has expressed support for E3's success but also alluded to Microsoft holding a separate event around the same time in Los Angeles.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jank. I am saying "jank" several times upfront, not because Spacebourne 2 is particularly janky, but because it is a bit, and I want to temper your expectations so you're not unfair on its flaws if you try it after I bang on for the rest of this article about how impressive it is.
There's a dream space game we all imagined, where you pilot a ship freely around the galaxy, landing on planets and space stations and running around them doing stuff, finding things, maybe having a fight, then get back into your ship to launch into space, where you can stop at any time and do a little space walk. Maybe walk around on an asteroid, just because.
Spacebourne 2 isn't the dream. But for a game made, as far as I can tell, by one person, it is an astonishing effort to capture that spirit.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[“At some point," says Joel Jordan, "Animal Crossing poses the question to you with alarming force: how do you want to spend your time?”


Allow me to open with the scoundrel’s refuge that is a seemingly weighty dichotomy: I reckon there’s two really special types of indie games. Those that work wonderfully despite their smaller scope, and those that work wonderfully because of it. It’s that second kind - the particular and peculiar voyages into the miniature and mundane - that really spin wonders. Games like Unpacking, PowerWash Simulator, and Dinkum. Games humble enough in scope, and curious enough in outlook, to be uniquely capable of framing everyday experiences so that their inner oddness and strange magic - unfairly dulled by familiarity - shines. 


So, when Jordon - solo dev on the upcoming Time Bandit - brings up the question: how do you want to spend your time? I’m left pondering it for far longer than I think I otherwise would, thinking about it in context. The obvious answer here is: playing an videogame, please. But Time Bandit’s free demo doesn’t take long to make me almost uncomfortably aware that there’s more than one way to play something. I don’t even need to be anywhere near the PC. I might actually be playing it more when I’m not [X-Files music, but also I’m going somewhere with this].

In a clip pulled from Warner Bros. Discovery's fourth quarter 2022 earnings call yesterday, Warner Bros. president and CEO David Zaslav states that “...there’s lots more to come, including the highly anticipated Mortal Kombat 12 and Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League, games also set for release this year with ambitious launch projections.” You can watch the clip in the embedded tweet below.

Developer Netherrealm Studios has yet to announce anything on its end. Yesterday, studio head and Mortal Kombat co-creator Ed Boon cheekily tweeted, “so who has heard the news about Injustice 3?”  referencing the fact that for years, Netherrealm has released an Injustice game between Mortal Kombat entries, so technically, that would be next if it maintained that pattern. 
So who has heard the news about INJUSTICE 3 ?
February 23, 2023
Fans will have to wait for a flashier reveal, but a Mortal Kombat 12 launch would be huge for a year that already has Street Fighter 6 and potentially Tekken 8 on the schedule. Last October, Neththerrealm revealed Mortal Kombat: Onslaught, a role-playing mobile game also slated to release this year. 
Mortal Kombat 11 launched in 2019 to positive reviews (here’s ours). A story expansion called Aftermath arrived in 2020.]]></summary>

Publishers face significant challenges but with the entertainment industries and government now on board, Japan's systematic fight against piracy applies to all content, everywhere.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The difference between game and film reveals has always been funny to me. Game announcements are accompanied by million-dollar trailers, teased with reveals of reveals, and some fans tiptoe online to avoid the spoilers of a debut trailer. Meanwhile, films are often first revealed haphazardly through an excel sheet five years before they hit, or mentioned casually in an earnings call - which is exactly how Warner Bros. Discovery announced the existence of Mortal Kombat 12.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was excited to play The Settlers: New Allies. Not so much because it's the first Settlers game in thirteen years, but because the last game by developer Ubisoft Blue Byte was Anno 1800, the best city-builder this side of Cities: Skylines. With an evocative depiction of its simulated industrial revolution, including some delightfully chewy production-line wrangling, Anno 1800 was a treat, and I was keen to see what the Dusseldorf-based studio would cook up next.
The answer, unfortunately, is a big bowl of strategy gruel. I'm not sure what has gone wrong in the last five years, but Blue Byte clearly left whatever magic Anno 1800 had in the nineteenth century. The Settlers: New Allies is a dismal strategy affair, confused, anaemic, and achingly dull.

Set five years after Batman: Arkham Knight, the adventure centers on the villains turned government-mandated saviors trying to stop a global invasion by Brainiac, who has hijacked the minds of Earth’s greatest heroes.
Metropolis serves as the game’s open-world sandbox, and the adventure can be enjoyed alone or with up to three other friends in co-op (requiring an internet connection for both and supports cross-play). The video presentation highlights each Squad member’s traits. Harley Quinn is the most acrobatic, sporting a grappling hook to swing across buildings. Deadshot uses a jetpack to fly or hover while using various assault weapons to riddle foes with bul…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This year our project was accepted to the Google Summer of Code program for the eighth year in a row (and 16th time in total).
The intention of the program is to bring new contributors to open source projects, and the eligibility rules for participants are the same as last year, with both students and non-students welcome to participate. Check the  Google Summer of Code website for details of eligibility.
Participants can apply for either short tasks (about 175 hours) or long tasks (about 350 hours). The coding period typically runs from the start of June to the end of August, but there is some flexibility and the participants can opt to use a longer coding period if they are not available to work full time on the project during the summer.
ScummVM is looking for applicants! A list of suggested projects can be found on this page, but we’re open to your own ideas too. Please make sure you provide the required information in your application before submitting. We also strongly encourage you to join our Discord server and follow the #scummvm-gsoc channel where you can engage with our mentors and the rest of the team, and get advice and help on getting started with the project and writing your application.
We have gathered some information to guide you, based on our previous 15 years of experience in the program. You may start your exploration from our Google Summer of Code miniportal.
We are looking forward to your application and participation!
