        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Promise you won't tell the other children, but the RPS staff are actually complex magical spells cast by the Sugar Plum Fairy, as part of an age old pact with the ents of the forest where the RPS treehouse was built hundreds of years ago. Each year the Sugar Plum Fairy has to collect more wishes to power the spells every year (you can help to make the spells more powerful by joining the RPS supporter program). While she's out wish-hunting, here are some Christmas Crackers to distract you.
Time to enjoy your lovely joke!

Over the holiday season, we're republishing select articles from Nintendo Life writers and contributors as part of our Best of 2023 series. Enjoy!

Some people can't help but translate things. We see languages, and we want to decipher them, like the people who climb Mount Everest just because it's there. The languages in games like FEZ, Titan Souls, Heaven's Vault, 7 Days To End With You, and Noita, invite the player to try to crack them to reveal more of the game's lore, and players are often rewarded for doing so, even if it's usually just extra story.

I apparently have a type. I’m sorry.
Still, while the man’s rules prevent me from recommending Deep Rock Galactic or Darktide, I do have a few picks that fell short of full Advent Calendar glory. And they’re all... colourful, quite short indie platformers? Hmm, maybe I have two types.

According to TrueAchievements, after calculating the cost of each new game on Xbox Game Pass, the total amounted to nearly $9000.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Make a little life in your spare time.
Video games are usually based on a power fantasy. We wish we could slay the dragon, overthrow the evil king, or run faster than any hedgehog ever should. Possibly the biggest power fantasy of all, though, is offered by Terra Nil, which allows you to tackle the overwhelming existential dread of climate change.
In Terra Nil, you are given a simple task – repair a ruined, barren planet, coaxing plants and animals back to the surface until the world is teeming with life once more. It is a beautifully simple concept that is almost perfectly executed by developer Free Lives. It takes a fine touch to turn one of the most stressful topics in our world into a genuinely relaxing interactive experience, but this is a wonderfully balanced game that accomplishes exactly what it sets out to do and never feels repetitive.

However, in retrospect, this is partially due to me getting it confused with Don Doko Don, a 1989 arcade game in Taito’s single-screen format. If I knew what I was thinking about, I’d be even more excited.


Hammerin’ Harry is a port of Irem’s 1990 arcade game, which was called Daiku no Gen-san: Beranme-chō Sōdōki in Japan. While Irem is perhaps best remembered for their R-Type series, their back catalog is built from an extremely colorful mix of titles on both arcade and consoles. There are a lot of underappreciated greats like Undercover Cops and Gekisha Boy which, to be fair, are largely unknown in the West because they were never localized.

Back in the day when consoles had fewer bits than humans have fingers, games could mostly get away with providing solid gameplay above all else.
Gameplay is still king, of course, but games these days often need to demonstrate other qualities, such as striking visuals, an engaging story, and strong characters. After all, what would The Legend of Zelda be without the likes of Ganondorf, Tingle, or Beedle? What would Super Mario be without Bowser, Toad, or Peach? Good characters are ultimately what elevates a great game into a lasting, beloved franchise.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[And thus, we arrive at the end of another year. A year filled with some very excellent games, and some very not excellent games. And through it all, the RPS guides team has been quietly toiling away, appeasing The Beast That Is Google with medium-rare slabs of SEO meat, and providing the answers to oft-asked gaming questions.
It's important to me to have a moment in the year where we can step into the light for a little bit and celebrate everything the guides team has accomplished this year. Usually we stay well out of the spotlight, because people only like seeing guides if they're actively searching for it. But today, we're staging a coup. We're taking centre stage, and threatening the lighting technician with all manner of disagreeable bodily experiences unless they keep the spotlight fixed firmly on us for the duration of this post.
2023 has been an amazing standout year for guides. Let's take a look at the games that have defined the year for us, and celebrate some of the fantastic work our team has published.

Really, 2024 is already shaping up to another big year for games. Right off the bat in the first quarter, we'll see RPG fans eating well with the likes of Infinite Wealth, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, Dragon's Dogma 2, and Persona 3 Reload.




Princess Peach gets to take the stage, and Ubisoft might deliver a bit of a surprise with Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown. Also, we'll (probably) see the launch of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League and Skull and Bones. That's just in the span of January to March!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At the end of every year, gamers are faced with an undeniable fact: far too many video games are released in a 12-month span for anyone to reasonably play them all. It's literally my job to play video games and I bet someone could fill a reasonable top ten this year of titles I didn't even get time to touch. But even as it's a universal, undeniable truth, the revelation that you missed out on something popular is always met with the same incredulous statement.
“You've never played this?”
I understand the impulse. For instance, Baldur's Gate 3 took up so many hours of my 2023 that it's hard to fathom what the year would be like without it. This sentiment extends well beyond GOTY talks, though – some games are so fundamental to our taste or upbringing that it can be hard to process that peop…]]></summary>

It was a fantastic year for gamers at home with great tentpole releases from PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo, and some excellent indies, too. For years to come, we will all likely argue that 2023 was one of the best – if not the best – year for games. But it was also a terrible year for the people who make games, with more than 10,000 developers laid off, studios closed, and more. 
Between big video game releases, a heartbreaking amount of layoffs, record-breaking acquisitions and box office reports, and more, 2023 contained plenty of news stories that had us talking for weeks, speculating on the future of the industry, and reshaping how we view game development.

After a short delay this week, the latest UK boxed charts are in, and it's a resounding success for EA Sports FC 24 over the Christmas week as it lands in the number one spot once again. Hot on its heels, however, is Super Mario Bros. Wonder, a game that has maintained strong sales since its launch back in October.
Elsewhere, it's a pretty familiar picture this week; particularly in the top ten with several games retaining the same position as last week. Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora has managed to sneak back in at number eight, while - oh for goodness sake - Grand Theft Auto V also performs reasonably well to snag the number ten spot.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a nutshell.
Though retro-styled games are all the rage among indies these days, it's rarer to come across something that could have been released on the hardware it references. Chico and the Magic Orchards DX expertly blends old-school design philosophies and aesthetics with some slight modern touches to make for a compelling and enjoyable little experience that feels like a genuine Game Boy title.
Developer Daikon Games places you in the role of the titular chipmunk and tasks you with retrieving walnuts from various themed levels by rolling them each to the end goal. Gameplay mixes platforming and puzzle solving in a fashion that feels vaguely reminiscent of the GB(C) Zelda games, and we particularly appreciated how every stage introduces some new gimmicks or obstacles to overcome.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The increasing use of AI in gaming draws ambivalent responses. While some appreciate it when used in the right context, others complain that it lacks the artistic flair that only humans can bring. Date Ariane’s creator, Ariane Barnes, has been warning of the possible harms of AI in gaming all year, and it hasn’t stopped in December.


For the uninitiated, Date Ariane is a classic game that launched in 2004 and has gone on to be highly influential in the realm of adult visual novels. It has a simple premise - go on a date with Ariane and ensure it ends on a sexual note. It’s still available, has received remasters, and the creator has released other visual novels in the same vein.


In a blog released this month, she describes 2023 as the year of the rise and fall of AI, claiming that “in l…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've mentioned elsewhere that I played a lot of huge games this year, both literally referring to their size, and metaphorically referring to their brand name awareness (I had great intentions of doing a long-running Starfield diary, where I visited every planet I could until I got demoralised by the project, but unfortunately that turned out to be the length of one entry). I didn't play quite as many small, odd things as I would have liked in 2023. I am very pleased with the shape of our Advent Calendar this year, though, especially the mid-table, which has some good weirdo entries and some surprises there.
So I thought I'd struggle to come up with three reminders for you for the Selection Box. And yet I didn't! They're also very on brand. Words and murder you say? Maybe in 2024 I should make a resolution to switch things up a bit. Gotta keep you guessing, dear readers...

As 2023 comes to a close, many major publishers and developers in the industry are looking back on what has undoubtedly been one of the most, shall we say, interesting periods in gaming history.
One such publisher is PlatinumGames, which has posted a '2023 recap' video on X (formerly Twitter) to commemorate major releases such as Bayonetta Origins and The Wonderful 101: After School Hero, key anniversaries from its history, and other noteworthy events.

It's only four episodes long, but it offers a unique slice-of-life perspective of the franchise which may be enough to rekindle the flame of passion for the franchise in even the most disillusioned fans. 


The episodes are about fifteen minutes each, so you'll be done with all of them in about an hour. They're best binged sequentially, and though each episode is mostly self-contained, they all have the same relaxed vibe that makes watching the series an incredibly calming experience. 


The first episode introduces you to the protagonist, Haru, who's not having the best time in her personal life, so she heads over to the Pokemon Resort to reinvent herself as a concierge. She's expecting…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This year's Game Awards ceremony garnered a lot of justified criticism for the way it rushed winning developers off stage in favour of adverts, rambling conversations with Hideo Kojima, and celebrity cameos from the likes of Timothée Chalamet. 

Obsidian's Josh Sawyer was right when he called it an "embarrassing indictment of a segment of the industry desperate for validation via star power". Yet I still can't help but also see the Game Awards as something else: a sign of progress. That's because I remember the Spike Video Game Awards from 2007, which remains the nadir of both the games industry specifically and popular culture in general.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cor, there's been a lot of games this year, haven't there? While I've only slapped one Bestest Best badge down in 2023 (woe is me), our lovely freelancers, current RPSers, and former RPSers have done a whole lot more badge-slapping. A grand total of 26 Bestest Bests have graced our monitors this year, which makes it three more than last year's Bestest Best round-up. And I'd say it's a nice mixture of big budget open worlders, puzzle gems, and indie delights that make up our roster for 2023, too.
So yeah, I'd encourage you to have a flick through the list below and see if there's anything you can add to the wishlist. Even as the person with "Reviews" in their job title, I can confirm I literally have loads of these Bestest Bests in my backlog. I will endeavour to play a handful over this Christmas break on my Steam Deck, maybe combining the experience with a nibble on a mince pie. Anyway, enjoy! And Merry Reviewsmas!

I thought I was at 68, so I was trying to figure out how to fit one more in. But it turns out that OpenCritic is missing one, and poorer for it.


What are we here for? Right. My favorite games this year, in no particular order.


It is always hard for me to put year-end lists together because I can barely remember what I played last month. That’s it. There’s no “but” to that statement. Okay, roll the, uh… article.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The quality of video game releases in 2023 has been discussed in detail by many, and it will absolutely go down as one of the best years the medium has experienced, strictly in terms of the excellent games that were released. The larger industry and its members will always look back on 2023 with justified frustration.
Patterns in any year are always a given. Trends inspire entire genres to be prevalent, and we also have events like 2009, where there were two high-profile open-world games about super-powered humans: Infamous and Prototype. This year will certainly be remembered for games like The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and Baldur’s Gate 3, among others, but I can’t help but notice that RPGs citing a specific era of the genre were also, inexplicably, hugely popular.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[2024 is right around the corner, and what better way to kick it off than to get some complimentary games from your PlayStation Plus subscription? As announced in the PS Blog, this month's selection of games is headlined by A Plague Tale: Requiem, Asobo Studio's 2022 tale of sickness and siblings. While he thought it dragged on a bit in the second half, our reviewer said, "Calling Requiem a standard sequel is a disservice; Asobo has created a Plague Tale epic." You can read that full review here and take a look at the other two offerings below.
The other two games are Evil West and Nobody Saves the World, each also released in 2022. Evil West is a third-person shooter set in a world that's a fusion between a classic Wild West and gothic horror and one that reminded one of our editors of his time as a kid playing Darkwatch. Meanwhile, Nobody Saves the World is about a shapeshifting Nobody (yeah, that's his name) on a quest to find the wizard who can stop a fungal infection from overtaking the world. Written by John Carson, the Game Informer review reads, "Despite its minor shortcomings, Nobody Saves the World kept me enthralled from start to finish."D All three games will be available to download on January 2.
And as always, as the new comes in, the old must go; subscribers will have until January 1 to download the current crop of PS Plus games, which includes Lego 2K Drive, Powerwash Simulator, and Sable.
Are you excited to check out any of January's PS Plus Games? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The annual CES conference showcases what new tech and ideas companies have been working on. Next year's event will be held on January 8, 2024, in Las Vegas. Sony has confirmed it'll be there, and you'll be able to watch its presentation streamed on its official YouTube channel at 05:00 PM PST. 


Described as one of the world's largest technology events, you'll want to keep an eye on CES to see what game-changing tech is coming our way. This could range from televisions to cameras and other electronics produced by the tech world. 


This year, Sony aims to focus on the company's purpose which is to "fill the world with emotion, through the power of creativity and technology." The company has yet to reveal what's in store, though it has revealed that it will be joined by Sony Honda Mobility. 


In its announcement of its attendance, the company looks back at its past attendance at the event. It appeared at CES for the first time in June 1977, and since then it has showcased plenty of new technology during its presentations, including the "world's first CD player." Since then, the company gradually shifted its approach to the event, and it is now concerned with "introducing its latest technologies and initiatives that support creators."


You should be warned that this event is not centered on PlayStation, and it is only one of Sony's several ventures. Nevertheless, past CES events have brought us some interesting gaming news. In 2023, we got a look at Sony's accessibility controller which launched on December 6, while in 2022 we got a glimpse of the PS VR2 which hit shelves in February this year.  


CES 2024 is set to be another packed event filled with exhibitors hoping to show off their latest advancements. According to the event organizer, there will be over 150 companies represented. Companies that have confirmed their attendance include Samsung, Lenovo, and Intel to name a few.

Prior to joining the RPS Treehouse in late October, I spent much of the year organising a massive international move with my family from the US to the UK, which meant that many of 2023's fresh releases - aside from the few that I've highlighted in this year's advent calendar - remained in the unplayed depths of my Steam list. Now that it's December and life has settled somewhat, I had to wrack my brain to come up with three entries for this Selection Box. After much deliberation, I realised that there were a few indie gems that I managed to crack open amidst all the chaos of arranging 60+ boxes for shipment across the Atlantic.

The hybrid console received critically acclaimed exclusives like Pikmin 4, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, and Super Mario RPG. Recently, Nintendo revealed the top 30 most downloaded games on Japan's eShop in 2023. 


The list doesn't come with too many surprises, although if you haven't been paying attention, it may be unexpected to see Pikmin 4 clinching third place. It didn't cause too much of a splash in the West, but Famitsu lists reveal that it has been selling well in Japan. It may also be a shock to see that Tears of the Kingdom isn't in the number one spot and sits in second place instead. 


That's because Suika Game takes first place, a game that has accumulated over 5 million downloads worldwide. The whole top 30 list …]]></summary>

Each year the Sugar Plum Fairy has to collect more wishes to power the spells every year (you can help to make the spells more powerful by joining the RPS supporter program). While she's out wish-hunting, here are some Christmas Crackers to distract you.
Time to enjoy your lovely joke!

By the end of his journey through Silent Hill, everything will be chaos – his mind and even the world around him, a violent cacophony of anguish.
But in the beginning, it’s silent. The kind of quiet that’s deafening, where you hear your pulse in your ears, and every tiny sound becomes the worst thing you can imagine.
Includes spoilers for Silent Hill 2
The opening hour of Silent Hill 2 is – without question – the scariest thing I have ever played. Which, taken at face value, might seem a bit ridiculous. Your goal is simply to navigate James through a dilapidated apartment building. At most, you’ll face 10 enemies throughout the building’s three floors, but they hardly pose a threat; they’re easily avoided or killed. Gameplay primarily consists…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Valve has released its annual "Best Of" list highlighting the top-performing games on Steam measured by gross revenue and player engagement.
The categories are top sellers, best-selling new releases, most-played games on PC, most-played games on Steam Deck, highest-grossing early access games, most-played using a controller, and best-selling VR titles. The top 12 games in each category earn Platinum status, while everything below them is grouped into a descending ranking of Gold, Silver, and Bronze. It's a fun snapshot of the games Steam users dug into most this year and a reminder that games seemingly on the downtrend or long in the tooth (like, say, Destiny 2) clearly have a lot of players still logging in to play.

Back in 1997, Final Fantasy VII established Sephiroth as one of the most iconic antagonists in gaming history. In 2020, Final Fantasy VII Remake greatly expanded his role in the first act of the beloved RPG, and in 2024, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth hopes to give us even more context for the One-Winged Angel. We played a portion of Final Fantasy VII Rebirth and spoke with several members of the development team to learn how Sephiroth is depicted in the upcoming second act of the Remake trilogy.

You could finally learn piano, you could re-commit yourself to bouldering, you could finally scratch out that novel. Or maybe you could just play a lot of video games. That's no less noble a pursuit. So what is your video game resolution for 2024?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It has once again fallen to me to pick out my favourite features, this time from 2023. This is a terrible task, because there are always a lot I like. I've tried to cut it down a bit from last year, for both our sakes, dear reader, and decided that previews don't count (because as a format previews do a lot of the work for you, to be honest). Even reducing my task this way made it tough to whittle things down, and I'm sure I've missed some excellent articles and writers - and that I will be corrected in the comments!
Still, read on for a place to start if you want to look back at the year that was on RPS. We've got interviews, community nonsense, and even more interviews for you to enjoy here. I think in 2024 I'm going to advocate for more horseposting.

For collectors and players, there were a few changes to get used to this year. Some were aesthetic; for example, the cards from the Crown Zenith set, which was released in January, are the last to feature yellow borders. Additionally, the name of each Energy card is now printed on the top of the card alongside a new subtype tag.


Of course, there are also price changes to get used to. The MSRP for booster packs went up from $3.99 to $4.49. To make up for this, each booster pack now has three guaranteed holofoil cards and an extra boos…]]></summary>

When you think of pirates, history mainstays like Blackbeard might come to mind alongside the fictional Jack Sparrow. An important but often forgotten name, however, is Cheng Shih. Not only is Cheng Shih one of history's most successful pirates, but she's also the woman who took over her late husband Zheng Yi Sao's pirate armada after his death, putting her in indirect control of 40,000-plus pirates for a nearly decade-long stint in Chinese waters in the early 19th Century. While Shih's story can be found on pages of books and elsewhere, Singer Studios aims to bring her story to life in VR.

Sporting a sweet headband and rugged gi, Kuma looks to be an unbearably challenging opponent. His furious paw swipes show he has no problem bearing arms, even against his perennial crush, Panda. In fact, she could bearly stand up to him! But don’t take my word for it. Bear witness to Kuma’s grizzly carnage by watching the trailer below.

Indeed, as per Battlestate Games' forum announcement, the studio is preparing to release the big Escape From Tarkov patch 0.14, which comes with a slew of new weapons, bosses, movement abilities, and the long-awaited Ground Zero starter map. On top of all of that, the game's meta is being rebalanced by a meaningful margin, with barrel attachments getting reworked from the ground up.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been a long time coming, but the ambitious Fallout London mod is on the horizon. The bad news is that the team has been unable to meet its intended 2023 deadline. The good news, however, is that the fan-made Fallout 4 project is just a few months away from release.


In the latest dev video diary, narrator and voice actor Drew Faithwaite has given the skinny on where things are at with Fallout London. As of now, the project is pretty much complete, save for some testing. After all the hard work and dedication, Faithwaite is proud to announce that the mod is finally coming out on April 23, 2024.




Our British readers should be familiar with that date, as it's when St. George's Day takes place. Talk about patriotic! There's not long to wait now, and this extra time gives the volunteers one last push to get London ready.


One of the most ambitious mods out there


If you're a fan of Fallout but aren't sure what this project is, boy are you in for a treat! It's essentially a community-made DLC-sized modification for Fallout 4 that – as the name heavily implies – sets things in England's capital city, complete with its own story and factions.


It boasts 90,000 lines of dialogue (more than New Vegas, apparently), new animations, plenty of quests, as well as 15 districts to explore, including Croydon, Hackney, Camden, Westminster, and of course, the City of London itself.


The team sadly had to push the initial release window back due to global issues involving some of the developers. However, things appear to be on-track again and the delay doesn't seem to have hampered the mod too much.


Check out the official Fallout London website for more details about the project. I, for one, am very excited about it. Is that because I'm British myself? That could be part of it, I admit.

No director or writers are attached at the moment, nor is there any mention of a release date or window. However, series creator theMeatly confirmed his involvement via Twitter. In another tweet, the creator mentioned that the project has been in the works for quite some time. With the official announcement out of the way, it seems like things might kick up speed in terms of production.

Alan Wake 2's story is split between Alan Wake the writer, and Saga Anderson the FBI agent who has been dragged into a twisted tale. In Spider-Man 2, Peter Parker's back but he shares the spotlight with Miles Morales.

The tuned-to-perfection turn-based combat, the beautiful soundtrack, the heartfelt story, and the eye-popping-for-the-time visuals created one of the most important entries of one of the most important franchises in video game history. However, one element was absent from Final Fantasy X that several of the key developers involved with the project lamented: an explorable world map.
For Yoshinori Kitase, a producer on Final Fantasy VII Rebirth who also served as a director on Final Fantasy VI, VII, VIII, and X, the world map's disappearance was a sore spot as someone who has been involved with the series since 1990. "We started off expressi…]]></summary>

Everyone knows that the days between your winter holiday and New Year's Eve are for gaming, right? At least, we hope you're doing some gaming today, tomorrow, and the day after! Or maybe you're kicking back with a good book, or watching a new movie?


We don't know what it is you're doing but we want to! In fact, we want to know what video game presents you found under the tree or in a beautifully wrapped gift box this year, too.
Did you get a new console? Did you get some games to add to your never-ending backlog – we're all still catching up on 2023's frankly absurd gauntlet of releases, right? Did you get some cool shirts, some Fortnite V-bucks, or a new coffee cup with Clive from Final Fantasy XVI on it?
Whatever it is you got, we want to know so drop a line in the comments below! And if this year's gifts weren't video game-themed, tell us what your favorite gift was anyway! 
On behalf of everyone here at Game Informer, we hope the holidays are treating you well (and we hope you're getting through that backlog for the sake of 2024's release schedule).]]></summary>

Within a single character, there's a huge amount of work done behind-the-scenes. It's not just design, or writing, or even direction. The actors themselves put themselves into it, and in a time where stabs at so-called AI are propagating at an uncomfortable rate, celebrating all the minds that make these characters shine is crucial, too.




At their best, a character gives the player a tangible, connective experience with a game. Something they want to share with friends, write about, create art for, and remember well. Whether it's a newfound main in a fighting game, a favorite co…]]></summary>

This is on top of the toolset allowing anyone to make and publish their own games within Fortnite.
The whole thing was kind of weird.
Not that any of the experiences are bad – the Lego thing is super not for me, but I really like the racing game (made by Psyonix, developer of Rocket League), and I think the music element has the potential to become something interesting down the road. 
I'm just not so sure Epic's utopian vision of Fortnite as this everything app makes sense. I agree with the idea that Fortnite is a great social tool – but only in the way most online video games can…]]></summary>

However, the year's game release calendar was so much more than just those 10 games. Below, you'll see our winners for various categories, allowing us to celebrate a wide range of games, moments, characters, and elements from the extremely strong year for game releases.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bendy and the Ink Machine released as a set of chapters back in 2017 before a full complete release hit PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC the following year. Since then, it's become a fan-favorite horror game, thanks to its unique classic cartoon art style and fun puzzles. Now, players will officially get to see the haunts of Bendy and the Ink Machine on the big screen one day. 
The official Bendy Twitter account posted an image on December 25 that features Bendy's hand pointing at a projector, and on the projector, you can read, "Bendy is coming to the big screen." Check it out for yourself below:

The Artemis program faces many challenges but allowing people to learn about the program should not be one of them. Targeting the word 'Artemis' no matter what the context, a reckless anti-piracy sweep has demanded Google deindexing against dozens of innocent platforms for simply trying to report on mankind's quest for knowledge.

It's also perhaps no surprise that in the big spreadsheet of games I've played this year, I've set yet another new record for things I've played to completion. At time of writing, my list stands at 58 games for 2023, and by the time you're reading this in your post-Christmas lunch coma, I wouldn't be surprised if it had risen further. 58! That's more than one a week! Honestly, what was past Katharine thinking? No wonder I'm so chuffing tired right now.
In any case, my list of honourable mentions is so long this year I've taken the cheeky liberty of cramming some extra entries into my 2023 Selection Box, bringing you five more personal picks that I think are just smashing and that you should absolutely play when you get a spare moment or three.

On the game release side, there were some pretty incredible ones launched this year. And on the games industry side, it was historically fraught, as thousands have lost their jobs. Even the media side felt rough this year, as we saw outlets cut staff and close doors.




For me personally, I managed to do some writing I'm proud of, but it's still been tough. My hope is that 2024 doesn't have this stark contrast at the end, but only time will tell. I certainly feel games like Metaphor, Rebirth, and Dragon's Dogma 2 are already set up to make a big splash.


On the games front though, it was absolutely stellar. 2023's games got me through a lot. I'm certain we'll be talking about them for years to come, ranging from the …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rockstar is no stranger to leaks, and it seems the company can't even catch a break during the holiday season. 


It has been reported that GTA 5's source code has been leaked. According to @GTAFocal, an account that follows all Grand Theft Auto-related news, the contents of the leak aren't new and originated from the massive 2022 GTA 6 leaks. However, until this point, the data had been shared among private groups alone. 




Though some have been brazen enough to post the content on Twitter, Take-Two Interactive is taking down links leading to the leaks. This isn't the first time Rockstar has suffered a leak this year, and just a few weeks ago, we had the GTA 6 trailer showing up before Rockstar intended to debut it. 


While it might be tempting to have a peek behind the curtains to see what's going on with the GTA developers, it isn't the wisest idea to provoke a company that has shown itself to be willing to use the full might of the law to protect its IPs. The teen behind the infamous GTA 6 leak in 2022 was deemed unfit to stand trial and has since been given an indefinite hospital order. 


With a confirmed 2025 release date, it won't be long before we get more information on GTA 6 from official sources. As the reveal trailer has shown us, the upcoming crime game will be taking us to the state of Leonida which is "home to the neon-soaked streets of Vice City and beyond."

        <updated>2023-12-23T15:10:39.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Everybody calm down! It's happening! Everyone's favorite sword-wielding android, 2B, is coming to Granblue Fantasy Versus: Rising. I didn't know that I was missing her but it's abundantly clear that I was.


In a move that is both simultaneously surprising and not, Square Enix is licensing out one of its most popular characters. It appears that the puppet character, Nier, will have some competition in several ways.


When is 2B coming to GBVSR?


During Granblue Fes 2023, Cygames and Arc System Works announced the Nier: Automata star would be joining the fantasy fighter's roster in February 2024 as part of the Deluxe Edition Character Pass 1 or for $7.99 individually. In addition to 2B as a playable character, she'll also be usable as a Premium Avatar as part of the DLC.


For those who don't speak Japanese or want to sift through 6+ hours of footage, a post was made on Twitter (now X), including a 65-second video of the blindfolded battler. 




2B makes a rather stylish entrance with Pod following some conversation between the baffled Gran and Djeeta. She then gets to work with both the Virtuous Contract and Virtuous Treaty swords before unleashing a Skybound Art with several Pod units.


She looks formidable with large sweeping attacks, quick-fire attacks from Pod, and teleporting dodges aplenty. I'm certainly excited to try her out as, despite not really enjoying Nier: Automata's story, 2B's design and gameplay completely won me over.




This isn't 2B's first foray into fighting game territory, as she previously traveled back in time to fight against the likes of Nightmare and Voldo in Soulcalibur VI. She was a ton of fun to play then and her appearance in GBVSR looks to be a repeat performance. Whether you intend on playing her or not, it'll be wise to practice against her in the training mode as she's likely to be a popular pick following the release.

The Finals offers rare novelty in the competitive multiplayer genre, encouraging creative strategies impossible in other titles because of its immense environmental destruction, physics-based hazards, and armory of whimsical gadgets. This first-person shooter occurs amid a digital game show where varying counts of three-person teams fight over money caches in an objective-focused format. The Finals is unpredictable in the best way: gameshow events like meteor showers or orbital lasers remap previously memorized paths, map variants like m…]]></summary>

I bought them some time ago. I haven’t played them. They intimidate me.


Classic CRPGs are terrifying. I often say that game design doesn’t expire; it merely changes, but one common feature of ‘80s and ‘90s CRPGs is a wall of overcomplicated UI. The game itself might be relatively simple, but the sheer number of buttons, menus, and functions is staggering. I’ve been stopped while trying to create a character.


So, for the purposes of this article, I decided to finally step into SSI’s D&D world. Not in an RPG, goodness, no. I’m still terrified. Let’s, uh… Let’s start with 1990’s DragonStrike, th…]]></summary>

To paraphrase, I was told to trust it would be worth my time to see it through to its conclusion. Now, three weeks and change later, I have finished Astlibra Revision. And while I don’t think that advice was totally necessary, I still don’t know how to begin describing the experience.


For lack of a better option, the best way to understand this game is to understand its creator. Astlibra was developed predominately by one Japanese developer who goes by the name “KEIZO”. From what I’ve gathered, KEIZO is not a professional game designer. So in addition to his full-time job, Astlibra was the passion project he worked on in his free time. In that sense, Astlibra isn’t unlike that one RPG Make…]]></summary>

Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is one of four Nintendo-published GOTY winners



In the history of Destructoid's Game of the Year awards (dating back to 2007), four Nintendo-published games have won: Super Mario Galaxy 2, Bayonetta 2, Breath of the Wild, and now, Tears of the Kingdom.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Unfortunately, the rough year of 2023 for the games industry continues. Indie Publisher Versus Evil announced on Twitter today that parent company TinyBuild has shut down the company and laid off all the staff. Head of Production Lance James confirmed the closure on Twitter as well. 





"Welp. That was a fun 10 year ride. The entire Versus Evil team has just been laid off. Let me be clear - this wasn't a Versus Evil decision or choice."
- Lance James, Versus Evil Head of Production



Legal issues between the two companies recently ended


According to GamesIndustry.biz, earlier this month TinyBuild announced that it had settled a legal dispute with Versus Evil's former owner Stall Proof LLC. General Manager Steve Escalante and Head of Production Lance James were also involved in the legal dispute. In the end, TinyBuild paid $3.5 million and legal costs to settle the dispute, and Escalante left the company shortly after.


Over a decade of publishing


Versus Evil was founded in 2013 by Steve Escalante, who served as Marketing Director at ZeniMax Online Studios prior to doing so. In 2021 TinyBuild acquired the company as well as its QA Studio Red Cerberus. Over the last decade, Versus Evil has published very popular titles including The Banner Saga from developer Stoic and Obsidian Entertainment's Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire.


It's been as rough a year as I can remember for the games industry. This one feels extra cruel as we're just a couple of days away from Christmas and a little over a week from the new year.


We reached out to TinyBuild for comment but have not yet received a response.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In Japan, Hoshi wo Miru Hito for Famicom is considered a kusoge no densetsu or “legendary crappy game.” One of the worst games of all time. It never made it to North America, but now we can share the pain, as a complete fan translation for the game has been released.


There had been a previous attempt at a translation made by modder KingMike, but it was never fully complete, leaving much of the battle text in Japanese. Last month, user Brandnewscooby released a patch for that patch, which picks up where KingMike left off and finishes the translation of the battle text.

Sometimes called Stargazer by Anglophones, Hoshi wo Miru Hito is an RPG that Hardcore Gaming 101 calls “hilariously embarrassing on just about every level.” The RPG genre exploded in popularity in Japan following 1986’s Dragon Quest, and Hoshi wo Miru Hito seems like a pretty blatant attempt at trying to get in on that boom. It does bring some interesting things to the table, including a futuristic setting, and managed to just barely precede Fantasy Star.


However, every idea the team had seems to have been executed rather poorly. While considered to be somewhat charmingly inept, there are severe balancing issues and incredibly obtuse mechanics. The fact that English monoglots may now be able to understand the text doesn’t mean that they’ll be able to actually complete the game.


It was reported back in 2020 that City Connection was going to release the game worldwide, suggesting an official translation, but it only saw release in Japan.


Until we eventually get an official translation for Hoshi wo Miru Hito, you can find the initial fan translation patch here and the patch for the patch over here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Via Twitter, Insomniac has responded to the massive hack against the company and the subsequent leaking of their documents.


If you’re not familiar, Insomniac was targeted by a ransomware attack that resulted in a group of hackers gaining access to a great deal of footage from upcoming games, as well as a myriad of documents ranging from future plans to internal HR documents. The hackers then released some of this information, with threats of publishing more if their ransom demands weren't met.


“We’re both saddened and angered about the recent criminal cyberattack on our studio and the emotional toll it has taken on our dev team. We have focused inwardly for the last several days to support each other,” Insomniac's release says.




The statement acknowledges data involving “personal information belonging to our employees, former employees, and independent contractors.”


Hacks and leaks have been happening in the video game industry for decades. There have even been recent attacks against Sony and Rockstar, with the latter resulting in leaked development footage of Grand Theft Auto 6. Activision was hacked late last year, and it has been reported that employee information was compromised as a result of that, though the company claimed that it wasn’t.


But regardless of the company involved, I feel bad for the employees involved. I’m sure having development footage of a game that isn’t ready to be shown off yet is vexing and disappointing, but having HR documents stolen can be traumatic. Having them leaked on the internet can lead to horrible problems for the people affected.


As for Wolverine, Insomniac says that development is continuing as planned, and the team will share "official information" when it's ready.

I trust you will pace yourself and enjoy these traditions responsibily, like a Cadbury selection box. Or slam right through them, that's fine too. After playing Skeal got your toe tapping to the beat and your heart pounding with power and pleasure, you're ready to trash Christmas with a catchy tune in Dracula Cha Cha. And after Skeal also prepped you for pain, oh, here we go: it's Christmas Pain In Christmas Town.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Metal Gear Solid’s Master Collection was a fairly underwhelming package of some of the greatest video games ever made when it released back in October. While official updates since then have done little to address some of its most egregious problems - leaving modders to step in, as usual - the game’s latest patch has finally offered up a decent serving of improvements direct from the source.

Its world is largely a mystery, because all that matters is the situation its protagonist Boulder is stuck way, way too deep in. Everything feels like it's about to come to a head somehow, even though you have very little idea what's going on.
Its world could almost be a post-apocalypse one, a feeling that persists even though it's unclear how true it is, how much is ambient cult brainwashing, and how much just the result of Boulder starting to lose himself after being undercover for far too long.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hear ye! This month marked the 25th birthday of Thief: The Dark Project. While not as infinitely mutable as other 90’s icons like Doom (which just turned 30, and can be played on a pregnancy test), stealth gaming’s grandpappy has maintained an enduring appeal and influence, especially for those more inclined to sneaking than slaughter. Buckets of digital ink have already been spilt examining this legacy, so I won’t dive into the weeds of a hagiography. What I want to highlight is a major event that marked the 25th anniversary – one that makes today as great a time as any to explore Thief’s still-thriving mod scene.


Notable: After a quarter-century, stealth fans were gifted a new, 10-mission Thief campaign called The Black Parade. Pitched as a prequel to the first game, it features a new protagonist, new story, and new heists, built by some of the most lauded modders on the scene. More notable still: The team lead is Romain Barrilliot, a fan-turned-pro designer at Arkane, where he, alongside other former Thief acolytes, iterates the immersive sim tenets in their patented im-sim laboratory. Mostest notablest? One of Thief’s original designers, Daniel Thron, joined The Black Parade’s team – and simultaneously released a new Thief short film, featuring the original game’s voice actors.

The hacked data comprised of more than 1.3 million files, for a total of 1.67 terabytes of data, including information about Marvel's Wolverine, future Insomniac Games titles, release schedules, private employee information like tax and employment forms, internal studio messages, and more.
Insomniac has now publicly addressed the hack in a new statement, stating that development on Marvel's Wolverine will continue as planned.

December 22, 2023
Here's what the studio said, in full: 
Last week, Rhysida revealed it had hacked Insomniac Games, posting images to prove the validity of its claim and demanding 50 bitcoin – roughly $2 million – from Somy within seven days or it would release what it had discovered. Sony did not comply with the demand and the ransomware group released 1.67 terabytes of hacked data pertaining to Insomniac. 
Insomniac just released Marvel's Spider-Man 2, which we loved – you can read about why in Game Informer's review here. The studio revealed Marvel's Wolverine back in 2021, revealing this year that the game takes place in the same universe as Marvel's Spider-Man.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[South Park: Snow Day, the upcoming four-player cooperative adventure first announced in August, is coming on March 26. A new trailer shows off more of the game’s frosty action and, of course, the series’ signature foul-mouth humor.
As the New Kid, players join Cartman, Stan, Kyle, and Kenny on an epic quest after a blizzard blankets the Colorado town, and school is canceled. Like the most recent South Park titles, The Stick of Truth and The Fractured But Whole, the adventure is told through the lens of a make-believe high-fantasy adventure, but Snow Day ditches turn-based combat in favor of a more action-oriented experience. 


Players can use different melee and ranged weapons, wield magic and other abilities, and customize their character with various clothing. Snow Day can be played with up to four friends, alongside strangers in online matchmaking, or as a solo experience with A.I. allies. 
South Park: Snow Day is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[First Contact Entertainment is a studio specializing in VR games, and it is behind titles like Firewall: Zero Hour and Firewall Ultra. It has announced that it will be shutting down by the end of the year. 


According to the announcement from the studio, a "lack of support for VR within the industry has eventually taken its toll." Though the company wishes it could continue with its AAA VR projects, it has become impossible to justify the expenses. 


This is notable news for the VR community, as Firewall: Zero Hour was a popular PS VR title that had earned itself good reviews. Firewall Ultra was released for the PS VR2, though it failed to impress players as much as its predecessor. 


Employees have commented on the imminent closure on social media, celebrating their time with the studio while announcing their availability for new opportunities. They join the ranks of thousands of other gaming industry employees who have found themselves in a similar position this year. It has been estimated that in 2023 alone, around 9,000 video game jobs were lost. 


First Contact Entertainment isn't the only company struggling to master the VR space, with Sony also calling it a "challenging category." PS VR2 players looking for first-person shooters aren't out of luck, however. The PlayStation VR2 has a few FPS titles available, with Pavlov being an unmissable standout.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fntastic announced earlier this month that it would be closing down, just days after launching its controversial game, The Day Before. It said at the time that servers for The Day Before would remain in operation but that the game's future was unknown. Now, the studio has announced that it has officially ceased operations and The Day Before's servers will be turned off next month. 
More specifically, the servers will be turned off on January 22, 2024. While the game has an emphasis on online play, it could still be played offline. However, on December 12, five days after the game launched on Steam, it was pulled from the storefront and The Day Before hasn't been available for purchase since. Plus, Fntastic says the game will be "retired." 
pic.twitter.com/GIX4ZAztny
December 22, 2023
Here's Fntastic's full statement on the server closure: 
The Day Before launched into Early Access on December 7. The game peaked at 38,104 concurrent users at launch on Steam but today, that number is down to 55 players, according to SteamDB. In those four days, The Day Before also received enough negative reviews from players to place it into the 10 worst-reviewed games on Steam. 
Over the years, The Day Before has been the subject of controversy, ranging from requests for volunteer work, various delays, broken promises, and more. Fntastic has scrubbed its entire YouTube channel, leaving the following note as its channel's description: "We're grateful to everyone who supported us during these difficult years. It's been a fantastic journey over the past eight years." 
[Editor's Note: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that Fntastic's statement said, "Steam will not proactively refund all remaining players." The statement says, "Steam will now proactively refund all remaining players" and the story has been updated to reflect that. Game Informer regrets this mistake.]

After almost eight years as a studio, it will shut down at the end of the year. It cites a lack of VR support within the industry. 


"After almost eight years of working with the most amazing team I've ever had the pleasure of being part of, I'm sad to announce that we will be closing our company First Contact Entertainment by the end of the year," a Facebook post from the company reads. "The lack of support for VR within the industry has eventually taken its toll. As a AAA VR game developer, we are just not able to justify the expenses needed going forward. 
"We are a team of fearless innovators willing to push new technologies to its limits. I am extremely proud of the team and grateful to our investors, our partners and of course, our community of dedicated and passionate players. It's been a wild ride. Thank you."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The existence of the Upper Lunch Hut implies the existence of a Lower Lunch Hut, but as far as I can tell, no such building exists. It's one of many mysteries that surround the edifice, which I discovered during a holiday in the Cairngorms this August, while everybody else at RPS was writing about some tyrannous entity called Gamescom.
First, the approach: having exited a vast pine forest of primeval aspect and supernatural disposition, with distant, daylit clearings leading the eye deeper and deeper into the undergrowth, till it feels at last as though your gaze has become tangibly enmeshed with clutching root and lowering branch - having finally escaped from that terrible, terrible forest, with its single, mournful stream crossed by a bridge of predatory bareness that is surely a haven for trolls, you set out across a grey and purple oblivion of reed and heather, a moorland rising to the border between glens, broken only by the stark red stain of a door. Nearing this otherworldly aberration, this scarlet phantasm, you realise that there is a house constructed around it, a sloping excrescence of withered planks and flaking plaster. What fell secrets could it harbour? Let us go and make our visit.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony has been testing the waters with different hardware this year, including the PlayStation Portal and the PS VR2. In an interview with the Financial Times, Eric Lempel, the head of global business at Sony Interactive Entertainment, reveals how some of these projects have been faring. 


Though Lempel states that the VR headset sales are "going well," the VR category is still challenging. He argues that "there was a higher expectation generally for what VR would do to gaming." Other hardware benefitted from the Black Friday sales period, including the PS Portal. According to Lempel, PlayStation enjoyed its most successful November ever in both sales and revenue.

Sony is having no problems selling PS5s 


As Sony announced this week, over 50 million PS5s have been sold. This, according to Financial Times, means the console outsold "Microsoft's Xbox by almost three to one in 2023." Lempel comments on the sales milestone, claiming that with prior supply problems solved, the console is "now on track to outsell PlayStation 4" which has sold over 117 million units. 


Referencing data from Ampere Analysis, FT claims PS5 sales grew 65% while the Switch fell 18% and the Xbox fell 15%. Carolina Milanesi, an analyst from Creative Strategies, states that the divergences reflect differing strategies from the hardware manufacturers: "Sony really cares about selling hardware but from a Microsoft perspective, it’s more about their subscription service."


Sony recently released a slimmer version of the console, and with the right line-up of titles, 2024 could be another successful year for the company. Fortunately, we have titles like Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth and Rise of the Ronin to look forward to.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Like a circus strongman's barbells, 2023's year in VR has been heavily weighted toward either end. The last twelve months were bookended with the launch of two excellent VR headsets (although only one is truly relevant to us PC gamers) and a whole bunch of great VR titles. The summer, however, was the quietest I've known for a long time, to the point where I ended up playing two VR minigolf games in the absence of anything better to do. Fortunately, the last few months have made up for it, providing enough fantastic VR games to feed us well into next year. So it's an unevenly weighted set of barbells, the kind that would give our moustachioed muscleman a slipped disk.

The latter is the most fascinating, in my opinion, as it's seriously faster than its rivals in many games and comes with a better upscaler than AMD's FSR in XeSS. 
Today you can pick up this GPU for just £266 thanks to an Amazon UK Lightning Deal on a graphics card that comes from Amazon US - with no extra import or shipping fees. That compares favourably to the £320 that the next-cheapest A770 GPU costs, especially when you consider this is the better 16GB variant with a factory overclock!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Assassin’s Creed series debuted in 2007, and since then, the series has become a fixture in the gaming landscape. It received reliable annual installments (or more!) for several years; that cadence has relented a bit now, but the franchise's long history has certainly left us with no shortage of Assassin’s Creed games to enjoy. But how do they stack up against each other?
 We originally published a version of this list back in 2015, but more Assassin's Creed games have released now, and some of our perspectives have shifted. So we are taking another look at the titles in the whole main series (no spin-offs or side-stories) and ranking them, highlighting the best moments and acknowledging the weaknesses in each.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's just a couple of winners left to announce as Destructoid's GOTY awards wrap up for the year, and that includes our staff pick for the Best PC Game of 2023.


This year offered a healthy spread of genres, and studios big and small wound up making our cut. Some of our favorite indies that didn't wind up competing for that genre's award wound up here, as Slay the Princess, Cocoon, and BattleBit Remastered compete for a spot among PC greats.


Starfield is competing here too  — there's no reality in which I'm playing that on consoles without mods, and it seems a lot of us are in the same boat. There's also Baldur's Gate 3, Dave the Diver, and Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty on our nominees list, but Larian's brain tadpoles ultimately win here. 





That is to say, Baldur's Gate 3 is Destructoid's Best PC Game of 2023. It's one of the games that, even in a year of heavy hitters, stands out as a must-play. 


Our review, handled by senior editor Eric Van Allen, echoes many of my own sentiments about the RPG as he praises its storytelling, visual scale, and strategic combat. I've spent more than my fair share of time troubleshooting it, especially into Act 3. But that I can still enjoy it this much this speaks to the quality of both what's already there and the continued update support from Larian. Even at its ugliest, Baldur's Gate 3 is a gem. 


I'm stuck in a constant loop replaying BG3, so it'll probably wind up my pick for 2024, 2025, and so on. The romances are just too good, and when I'm not poking around in Faerun, I'm busy modding it. Either way, thanks to the folks at Larian for pulling this together. It's a special game with a development tale I'm endlessly curious about, and I'm not sure if I'll ever play another like it.



Destructoid’s Best PC Games of 2023, nominees:



Baldur’s Gate 3


Starfield


Cocoon


Slay the Princess


Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty


BattleBit Remastered


Dave the Diver

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Arion Kurtaj, an 18-year-old hacker behind the massive GTA 6 leak last year, has been given an indefinite hospital order.


Kurtaj is a member of the international gang Lapsus$, which was behind various high-profile cybersecurity attacks over the past year. It is estimated that attacks on Uber, Nvidia, and Rockstar have cost the companies up to $10 million. Per the BBC, Kurtaj expressed apparent unwillingness to stop conducting similar attacks. 


It turns out that by the time he committed the GTA 6 hack, Kurtaj was already on bail for hacking Nvidia and BT/EE. The BBC reports: "Despite having his laptop confiscated, Kurtaj managed to breach Rockstar, the company behind GTA, using an Amazon Firestick, his hotel TV and a mobile phone."


Kurtaj and another unnamed member of the Lapsus$ hacking group are the first to be convicted, while others are thought to remain at large, according to the BBC.


In July, Arion Kurtaj was deemed unfit to stand trial following a diagnosis of acute austism. The court then had the jury focusing not on whether Kurtaj had done it with criminal intent, but solely on whether or not he had perpetrated the alleged crimes at all.


Regarding the mediate fate of Kurtaj, BBC reports: "He will remain at a secure hospital for life unless doctors deem him no longer a danger."


The news arrives just a few days after news broke of a massive hack at Insomniac, leaking details about in-development games and information about the studio.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's the time of year, folks. The Steam Winter Sale for 2023 is now live, offering some hefty discounts on thousands of games on the Steam store. For me, it's usually when I pick up titles I didn't have a chance to play throughout the year but definitely wanted to at some point. After all, not often is there a better discount than what we see with the Steam Winter Sale, at least anytime soon.




Some great deals


With so many titles on sale at once, usually, you can find games of every genre heavily discounted. This includes new releases and even those that have been out for some time. Here's a handful of great deals I've found while briefly looking over the sale:



Civilization VI — $5.99 (90% off)


Stellaris — $11.99 (70% off)


Total War: Warhammer III— $29.99 (50% off)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've recently returned to Warhammer 40,000: Darktide, one year after the grimdark Left 4 Dead 'em up launched and eleven months after I stopped playing. It was always fun to tear through the grubby guts of a Gothic industrial megacity with your chainsword, but it became repetitive and its whole loot-o-crafting mess sucked. A year on, the loot and crafting still suck, but I've really enjoyed the variety added by new levels and weapons and the polish from a year of tweaks and quality-of-life changes. If you played Darktide on Game Pass (or bought it), consider another look.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dominions is a series where you can build the Ark Of The Covenant, which blinds everyone on any battlefield it appears on. Games where any soldier can receive a horror mark, which attracts unspeakable phantoms from beyond reality to randomly attack them, and if they survive, they'll probably receive more horror marks. Games where I once deployed my entire military against an evil raven so large and powerful that I lost, leaving behind corpses that it fed on to grow even stronger. Games where a frog could, mathematically, kill god with one blow.
Dominions 6 is due out in January, bringing with it changes so esoteric that I'd be better off talking about Dominions 3 to Dominions 5 instead. So let's do that.

It appears Nate is quite unfamiliar with time travel films. We also think up some some resolutions for next year, and you've also got our regular recommendations to look forwards to at the end of the show. Plus, Nate does a thrilling end of year quiz with a question for each month. It goes about as well as you'd expect.

Final Fantasy VII Remake set the tone for what players could expect from this three-part retelling of the beloved 1997 Square RPG. The excellent updates to the combat system, the fantastic expansions on character relationships, and the stellar production values told us Square Enix is not taking the responsibility of remaking one of its most iconic games lightly. However, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth looks to take several components of the experience to the next level, largely thanks to its emphasis on side content.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick has announced he’s stepping down from his position on December 29. The news comes two months after Microsoft officially completed its acquisition of the developer/publisher. 
While it was previously announced Kotick would remain as CEO throughout 2023 to help ease the Microsoft/Activision transition, it had been believed (though not confirmed) that he would step down on January 1, 2024. Although his actual departure date is only a few days earlier, it means Activision Blizzard will be kicking off 2024 without Kotick at the helm for the first time in over 30 years. 
Microsoft has not yet named Kotick’s replacement. According to The Verge, several other Activision executives will be departing the company through March, including vice chairman of Blizzard …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following its launch last year, Pokémon Scarlet and Violet has received two DLCs as part of its Hidden Treasure of Area Zero storyline. The first, The Teal Mask, hit Switch in September; the second, The Indigo Disk, arrived last week, bringing with it plenty of returning legendaries and favorite starter Pokémon, too. Now, Nintendo and The Pokémon Company have revealed The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero will be getting an epilogue that hits the game in January. 
The companies announced this today with a brief trailer that teases a new adventure in the "Land of Kitakami" that awaits trainers. The epilogue goes live on Thursday, January 11, at 6 a.m. PT/9 a.m. ET, and, outside of goodbyes to friends from the journey of Generation 9, today's trailer also teases what appears to be a new Pokémon. 
Check it out for yourself below: 


In order to play through the epilogue, you must complete "a certain postgame event in Pokémon Scarlet or Violet" and you must complete the main stories of The Teal Mask and The Indigo Disk. 
For more about the games, read Game Informer's Pokémon Scarlet and Violet review and then check out our Teal Mask impressions here. 
What do you hope to see from this epilogue? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

I'm definitely here for the crash fixes - I can't get The Finals to run for longer than five minutes, which is a shame, because as Graham tells it, this is the most exciting new multiplayer FPS in years. Specifically, it sounds like a blend of Battlefield and Rainbow Six: Siege with a smashable toytown aesthetic. But enough about me and my computer's refusal to let me have fun. What's going on with those Heavies, then?

        <updated>2023-12-20T16:14:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony has announced that the PlayStation 5 has hit a sales milestone of over 50 million units. It achieved this milestone just over three years into its life cycle.
Since the console’s launch in November 2020, over 50 million consoles have been purchased as of December 9, 2023, according to a press release. In July, Sony announced the PS5 had sold over 40 million units, meaning that roughly 10 million more consoles were sold in just the last 4 to 5 months.


The holiday season is likely a big contributor to this bump. Additionally, the October release of the much-anticipated PS5 exclusive Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 (now the fastest-selling PS Studios game ever) undoubtedly drove players to pick up the console. 
The milestone is a nice way to cap off a busy 2023 for Sony. It launched new hardware with PlayStation VR2, the PlayStation Portal, and a smaller redesigned PS5. It also boasted marquee third-party exclusives such as Final Fantasy XVI and, for a few months, was the sole console home of the critically acclaimed Baldur’s Gate 3. 
It’ll be interesting to see how the console’s momentum fares going into 2024. So far, Sony’s first-party output consists of The Last of Us Part II Remastered arriving in January. Announced third-party exclusives include Final Fantasy VII Rebirth in February (GI’s latest cover story) and Team Ninja’s Rise of the Rōnin in March. We're curious to see what else Sony has up its sleeve as the next year progresses.]]></summary>

If Epic Games and my Switch were involved, Fortnite and Persona 5 Royal would've absolutely been included in the lineup, too. Motivation has lain mostly in co-op capers with friends, hangs with virtual pals, or in the battle royale-verse. Otherwise, nothing has truly given me the itch.
But I think 2024 could be a big one for me. Not only are a number of upcoming RPGs right up my alley, they align with new and existing motivations: hangs with pals and Japanese language learning. For the first time, I'm excited to embrace the grind both in-game and outside of it.

It's not that I dislike Gunfire's sci-fantasy co-op shooter - the multiple-dimension premise is pleasantly loopy, and I like the variety of procgen landscapes. There just aren't enough hours in the day, not when I'm replaying Into The Breach for the 14th time. Still, perhaps the introduction of a new mode built for quickfix, story-free sessions could persuade me to give 2023's 24th best game another whirl?

The two genres aren't worlds apart - R-Type's bosses, for example, are very Gigery, but they're nothing like as icky as the creatures you face in Angel At Dusk, in which every projectile appears to be some species of maggot, and your ship is a sort of evolving flesh-moth faerie reminiscent of China Mieville's Perdido Street Station.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blizzard have revealed their approximate update plans for the next year of arthouse oddity World Of Warcraft, which if I remember correctly is a "massively multiple-player" experience of some antiquity that involves Orcs - a kind of always-online Baldur's Gate, if you will, or a strictly fantasy-themed Fortnite with dungeons instead of forts. Seems far-fetched, but let's roll with it. 


As a reminder, WOW now comes in two broad flavours: classic and modern. In modern World Of Warcraft, you can expect three more updates for the existing Dragonflight expansion before the release of World Of Warcraft: The War Within later in the year. This introduces a new subterranean playspace, the Ringing Deeps, and is the first in a trilogy of expansions called The Worldsoul Saga.

I love this mouse because it's extremely comfortable, with a smooth and streamlined symmetric shape that sits easily in the hand, with a lightweight 63g design. This makes it extremely agile for fast-paced games, and this is backed up by bulletproof Lightspeed wireless, a top optical sensor and excellent battery life too. That's why I ended up with two of them - one in black and one in pink - and I still use them on the regular for Counter-Strike 2, Valorant and Warzone.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At the start of the month we highlighted a US deal on the Neat Bumblebee 2, which saw the USB mic tumble from an MSRP of $100 to just $17 at Woot. Today we've found the UK equivalent, as you can now pick up this excellent mic for just £9.99 at Currys - with a further £2.99 for delivery or free collection if you prefer. That's a great deal for the mic that cost around £30 for all of Black Friday and comes with my personal recommendation.

Following the events of 2020's Final Fantasy VII Remake, Cloud, Tifa, Aerith, Barret, and Red XIII have escaped the confines of Midgar and gotten rid of the Whispers, meaning the possibilities as they step out into the vast world depicted in the middle portion of the original Final Fantasy VII are endless. In contrast to the corridor-heavy structure of Remake, the openness of Rebirth is immediately refreshing, but as I found out during both my hands-on and hands-off demos, the improvements don't even come close to stopping there.
The exclusive portion of my demo – the hands-off part – takes …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s been encouraging to see how post-Steam Deck handheld PCs aren’t merely copying Valve’s homework.  The Asus ROG Ally made a (mostly) successful attempt at slimming down while upping performance, and now we have the Lenovo Legion Go: an even higher-concept portable with Switch-style detachable controllers. One of which transforms into a mouse. It’s a bit mad but I’ve always loved the concept’s ambition, even as I rendered working protypes a little less... working.
I’m happy to report that this, the Legion Go’s retail version, is far more resistant to such improprieties. Moreover, it’s basically the best Windows handheld out there right now – though some occasional fiddliness, and the looming issue of the Steam Deck OLED, mean it isn’t necessarily the finest palmable PC outright.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[AMD's Ryzen 7 7800X3D is a phenomenal gaming CPU thanks to its Zen 4 architecture and added 3D V-Cache which boosts gaming performance far beyond standard Ryzen 7000 processors. That performance - and extremely modest power draw and a reasonable price - has caused the 7800X3D to become the best selling CPU by a huge margin according to a German PC part retailer. 
Anyway, the Ryzen 7 7800X3D continues to drop in price. Recently we reported on a reduction in the UK, and now it's time for the US to get a turn on the deals train with a new asking price of just $339.99 - a full 40% off its US MSRP. That's a great price for a CPU that even comes with the breathtaking Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Multiplayer shooters have become defined in recent years by the methods they use to withhold power from players, whether that’s a hero shooter's unlocks and battle pass or a survival shooter's vast map of scattered goodies. Even before these systems became du jour, however, shooters often required you to be good at them before you unlocked their real pleasures, whether by perfecting your rocket timing in Quake or memorising level layouts in Counter-Strike.

The Finals' real master stroke, I think, is that it has found a design that lets it be generous with power - even while containing an unlock system, a battle pass, and a not insignificant skill floor. Those things aren’t an obstacle between you and the childish joy of smashing the world to bits.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For many years, the GOG.com affiliate program has been a great way to support the project. By using our affiliate links to buy your favorite games, you granted us a small commission from GOG.com – without having to spend more than the original price.
Earlier this year, GOG.com announced the discontinuation of its old affiliate program. Instead of using a simple referral link, they are now using two external affiliation networks that contain cross-site tracking, as considered by many ad blockers. Since we have been affiliated with GOG.com since 2009, we were able to use the legacy referral links for a couple of months after they initially discontinued them.
Unfortunately, our affiliate links were put to rest effective November 22nd, 2023.
Since we don't feel comfortable that you would have to use external affiliation networks just to support the project, and because tracking users is against our project policies, we decided not to join the new program.
We still value GOG.com as an excellent source for legally purchasing games supported by ScummVM. Even though we are not affiliated with them anymore, we'll continue to support their releases, e.g. by adding and updating the game data files' signatures for the ScummVM supported games that are available for purchase from GOG.com in our detection database and providing links to their releases in our list of available games.
Thank you GOG.com and everybody who used our affiliate link for your support over the last 14 years!
