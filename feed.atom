Marvel Rivals Season 0 (the pre-season), Chronovium, will end on January 9, 2025, at 10 PM PST (1 AM EST). The time will vary depending on your location. This means you only have a week left to complete your Battle Pass and any other missions tied to it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Christmas Update in A Universal Time (AUT) has added plenty of new content, including the Santa Claus NPC, and he can be your key to getting the Candy Cutlass Blade.


Back as part of the Christmas celebration, you can obtain this item by completing a certain quest. To begin, you'll have to talk with Santa Claus NPC and follow the next set of instructions. Let's take a look at how to get the Candy Cutlass Blade and what's the easiest way to do so.


How to obtain the Candy Cutlass in A Universal Time (AUT)


The first step is to go to the center of the town, and you'll find Santa Claus behind a blue-colored wall. The next step is to defeat 20 Hooligans. Go to the eastern part of the map, and you'll find an empty Skate Park to find them (they will have 'Hooligan' mentioned in their title, along with their levels). You can defeat them quite easily, just make sure not to get stunned by their attacks.


The next step involves obtaining the Candy Cutlass Blade by defeating the Grumpus Boss.


How to Defeat Grumpus in A Universal Time (AUT)




You can meet the Grumpus Boss in the Ice Fortress, and he spawns once every 45 minutes. You'll have to talk with Bawxstar NPC at the Christmas Tree, and he will take you to the Ice Fortress. The Grumpus has two types of attacks.


His ground slam is pretty strong, but you can completely evade it with the correct timing. The other attack type is a set of punches with short range, and you can also dodge them quite easily.


To make matters easier, you can play as a group. In that case, make sure to do at least 10% damage to be eligible for the rewards. Defeating the Grumpus doesn't necessarily guarantee the blade, so be prepared to repeat the process.


Once you get back the blade, take it to the Santa Claus NPC, and he will change it to the Candy Cutlass with a fresh set of moves.

It's happening, true believers: the Fantastic Four are coming to Marvel Rivals right on the eve of the game's first official season's launch. In a post on the official Marvel Rivals X (formally known as Twitter) page, NetEase Games confirmed that all four founding members of Marvel's First Family will enter the cosmic fray soon. That's right; Mr. Incredible, Invisible Woman, The Thing, and the Human Torch are all coming to Marvel Rivals simultaneously or back-to-back. Someone pinch me.

Super Rare Games has announced that the foundations are set for a SteamWorld Build physical edition on Switch. What's more, this one will be springing up quickly, with pre-orders opening on 9th January and shipping expected in March 2025.
This is a Super Rare Games joint, so naturally, there are a handful of goodies thrown in with each purchase. The boxed copy will retail for £37.20 (or your regional equivalent), including interior art, a full-colour manual, an exclusive sticker, and three trading cards featuring some of the game's characters. And yes, the full game is included on the cartridge, so don't expect any of that 'code in a box' nonsense.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Thorgan Hazard Winter Wildcards SBC is now live in EA FC 25, and it's the last special challenge from the Winter Wildcards promo. 


This is the first time Thorgan Hazard has received a promo item in this year's Ultimate Team. To get the item, you must complete the SBC before it expires. Let's look at how you can complete this SBC, and if it's worth unlocking at all. 


EA FC 25 Thorgan Hazard Winter Wildcards SBC tasks


The Thorgan Hazard Winter Wildcards SBC has two tasks, and here are the requirements. 


Task 1 - On a Loan



Min. Team Rating: 81



Task 2 - 83-Rated Squad



Min. Team Rating: 83



EA FC 25 Thorgan Hazard Winter Wildcards SBC solutions


The required fodder for completing this SBC shouldn't be a problem at all. In fact, this is the easiest SBC that has been released during the Winter Wildcards promo. 


Task 1 - On a Loan



Any 11 81-rated items



Task 2 - 83-Rated Squad



Any 11 83-rated items



At first, the 86-rated item looks extremely weak, and its base Pace (83) and Shooting (84) stats are extremely low. However, it can be included in a variety of evolutions that are currently available in Ultimate Team. The card can be obtained practically for free and won't be that bad of a choice if you can put it through an evolution.


At worst, it can act as an 86/87-rated fodder and help you complete a future SBC. If you're desperately short of fodder, you can skip this one.

        <updated>2025-01-02T18:16:26.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a twist that would make the series' protagonist proud, Netflix has seemingly shot itself in one of its many tentacles by accidentally revealing the release date for Squid Game's third and final season.


Netflix has recently released a preview for the third season. It features the few remaining survivors and a new doll which will likely be even more of a pain in the ass than the one from the red-and-green-light game that we all hate to love. But, more importantly, it closes off with the promise that the show will return in 2025.




The teaser also did, however, reveal more than it likely intended to, as Netflix Korea's account seemingly leaked the news that Season 3 would launch on June 27, 2025. Though this might be Netflix messing around with fans, it's highly unlikely, as nobody really stands to gain anything from a false release date.


This is huge news for two very important reasons. Squid Game's second season immediately had the strongest opening week in the history of Netflix, which is naturally a tremendous deal. Secondly, the second season, though incredibly fun and intense, leaves viewers hanging. Season two feels like it was either created as the first half of the final season or as something Netflix released just to quench fans' thirst. Season two ends on a huge cliffhanger, so fans will likely be happy to know they seemingly won't have to wait two more years for the series to reach its conclusion.


You can now watch Netflix's highly successful second season of Squid Game on Netflix, which will hopefully conclude on June 27.

The titular Judas has managed to break free of the AI-groomed status quo, and is out to start a revolution. "Bioshock Infinite in space", we called it, back in 2022, but Levine says it's more open-ended than either of his Bioshock endeavours, with a greater emphasis on other characters remembering and responding to your actions over time.

As a mischievous omnipotent being once said, Star Trek isn't about mapping stars and studying nebulae, but charting the unknown possibilities of existence. The voyages of the starships Enterprise et al. are journeys of self-discovery. It's about the people we meet on those strange new worlds and what they teach us about ourselves. It's not about taking turns to phaser each other in the face. Despite issues elsewhere, that's where Star Trek: Legends really fails.
It's not all bad, though. Emerald City Games' turn-based trawl, published here by Qubic Games, debuted on Apple Arcade back in 2021 and though some may baulk at its mobile-first design, it translates fairly well to Switch. The UI is well-proportioned and the touchscreen integration functions as you'd hope.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[All punch'd out.
We don't know about you, but amongst all of Nintendo's game series, Punch-Out!! rarely sits at the top of our revival wishlist. Don't get us wrong, we'd absolutely bloomin' love a new entry, but we'd honestly rather see the likes of F-Zero and Chibi-Robo! make their grand return on the Switch or its upcoming successor.
Regardless of whether or not you agree with us on this, it sounds like the Punch-Out!! series may well be dead and buried for good; at least with regards to developer Next Level Games. The lastest mainline entry, simply called Punch-Out!!, launched for the Wii in May 2009 with a WiiWare game entitled Doc Louis's Punch-Out!! following just a handful of months later. Thanks to the criticism levelled toward the former's use of stereotypical characters, however, it sounds like Nintendo isn't prepared to commence work on a new title anytime soon.

If you have played The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask over the past 25 years (and, if you're reading this, we'd wager that you have), then you likely will have engaged in a spot of lighthearted gambling at Mamamu Yan's Doggy Racetrack. The rules of this cute minigame are simple: choose a dog, place a bet, and win big if your pick performs well. The unspoken rule is that you never pick the lone blue dog. Why? Because the blue dog never wins. At least, that's what we thought.
Blue dog's racing abilities are poor, to say the least. No matter how many times we've played the minigame ourselves or watched others take part in speedruns, the colourful canine never seems to bring back top dollar. We were content to live with this fact (not everyone is cut for racing royalty, after all), but a handful of Majora fans dared to think more positively. If you can teach an old dog new tricks, then surely blue dog can get a win.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I think the last time I read an actual, original Garfield comic was in 1998. Since then, my experience of the character has been one long litany of Gar-memes and in particular, Gorefield memes. For those blissfully unaware, Gorefield is a version of Jim Davis’s otiose, lasagna-loving housecat who has broken his comic strip shackles and become a cosmic abomination. Gorefield's manifestations are many: centipede Gorefields, arachnid Gorefields, Gorefields that extend serpentine necks of unfleshed bone towards a cowering Jon Arbuckle, demanding to be fed in a voice that sounds nothing like Bill Murray, a voice as deep and velvety as the eternal Monday before the Big Bang.
In Gar-Type, a free Gorefield fangame from Youtuber and pixel artist LumpyTouch, Garfield has become a planet. The good news is that, unlike many other Gore-variants, this Gorefield is vulnerable to bullets. It falls to ace pilot Jon Starbuckle and his prototype starfighter, Gar-Type D, to save the Earth from lasagnnihilation.

Since you can't trade gold stickers outside of this event, it's a rare opportunity to get specific cards during brief 24-hour periods before being restricted to card pack opening again. 


It's also rare for Golden Blitz events to repeat past cards, meaning you might miss out on one you need if you're not online during a specific time. Let's check out every past Golden Blitz sticker during the Monopoly Games season to determine whether you'll still get an opportunity to trade a particular card.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wuthering Waves' All Silent Souls Can Sing update, also known as Version 2.0, introduced the Rinascita region, new Resonators to unlock, and the ability to change Rover's appearance. You can now change Rover's gender, but there are some limitations with how often you can access this feature.


How to change Rover's gender in Wuthering Waves


As of Wuthering Waves 2.0, you can change Rover's appearance by heading into Settings, Other, and Player Settings. You'll spot a section titled "Switch Appearance," letting you swap between Rover's two models every 24 hours. 


Screenshot by Destructoid


After you confirm the selection, the game will initially send you back to the log-in screen before returning to your new character model.


Since there's a 24-hour grace period for changing Rover's appearance, you won't be able to freely swap between them to compare both forms or change them between cutscenes. Once you switch over, you're locked into your new form until 24 hours pass, letting you swap back if you're unhappy with your initial choice.


Screenshot by Destructoid


Aside from Rover's appearance changing, there's no significant difference between Rover's two character models. They use the same weapon and have the same stats, Resonance options, and Fortes, with the only difference being their looks. Which version you use is entirely up to you and won't impact gameplay whatsoever. 


What does change, though, is cutscenes, attack animations, and character interactions. You'll appear as your newly chosen form in various cutscenes throughout Wuthering Waves' story, and you'll find a few minor differences in how your character moves.

The new update includes plenty of fresh additions, including the region of Rinascita. The fresh Sonata effects differ from how Echoes work, but the two are interrelated. The new additions are additions to the already-existing ones, and there are 16 different options you can enjoy.


All Sonata effects, as usual, have different impacts based on whether you have equipped a 2-piece or 5-piece set.

Wuthering Waves 2.0 has added the following Sonata effects: Frosty Resolve, Eternal Radiance, Midnight Veil, Empyrean Anthem, and Tidebreaking Courage. Check out the complete list of effects below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not many hours are left for the NumeroFUT promo to go live in EA FC 25, and the first set of leaks has hinted at the special cards coming soon to Ultimate Team.


NumeroFUT will be a new addition to Ultimate Team as this campaign hasn't been seen in older Ultimate Teams. Naturally, there are plenty of reasons to be excited, but EA Sports has remained tight-lipped about the promo cards as of writing. Only the release date has been confirmed, and if you're looking to find out more about the cards, you'll need to rely on the social media leaks and rumors. 


Complete list of EA FC 25 NumeroFUT promo players


Unlike Winter Wildcards, NumeroFUT won't be having any special set of Heroes and Icons. It will only include promo cards for active footballers, and a few big names have already been leaked. 



Rafael Leao


Robert Lewandowski


James Maddison


Eduardo Camavinga


Jonathan Tah


James Rodriguez


Pedro Neto


Dusan Vlahovic


Leon Goretzka


Mapi Leon


Jill Roord


Millie Bright


Goncalo Ramos


Evan Ndicka


Luuk de Jong


Minge


Jess Fishlock


Lewis Dunk


Billy Gilmour


Dante


Bourdieu


David Lopez


Balerdi


Douglas Augusto


Beattie



More names are expected to be added as the release date gets closer. Once we have more leaks, the names will be added to this list. James Rodriguez could be an interesting addition since he's been reintroduced to Ultimate Team only recently. Just like Juan Mata and David De Gea, we could get this first special card during the upcoming campaign.


NumeroFUT will go live on Friday, January 3, at 6 p.m. UK time when the special cards will be added to the packs. A few items are also expected to be released via SBCs and objectives, so make sure to be on the lookout for those. Additionally, Season 4 rewards also feature a few NumeroFUT items with Marco Asensio available as early as level 11. That's a great way to stack your club with a few promo items for free.

Mike Shapiro, the voice actor best known for his tantalizing portrayal of the G-Man, one of the eeriest and most mysterious presences in gaming, just tweeted something, well, tantalizing and eerie.




Long tweet short, Shapiro is clearly not speaking as himself, but rather as the G-Man, and he mentions of "unexpected surprises".


"Half-Life 3 confirmed" is one of the most frustratingly timeless memes in the history of the Internet. By now, we’re all champions at straw-grasping when it comes to believing in Half-Life 3. Whenever someone sneakily snaps a picture of Gabe Newell's breakfast, we can instantly come up with measured explanations as to why…]]></summary>

The South Korean show became an instant favorite for many, so it should come as no surprise to anyone that the show’s second season is already breaking records for the platform.


Released worldwide on Boxing Day (December 26), 2024, Squid Games season two has become the platform’s most-watched show within the first week of release, has taken a spot in the top 10 most popular non-English shows on the platform, and is the most watched show in 92 separate countries.




With the success of both seasons proving the popularity of the now world-renowned franchise, it’s no surprise that Netflix has confirmed that season three of Squid Games will be coming in 2025. While this is excellent news for fans, many ha…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Brendan Greene, the modder-turned-millionaire who designed battle royale game PUBG: Battlegrounds, wants to make his studio's next game a "metaverse", although he says he's wary of using the term. The project is called "Artemis" (at least for now) and you won't be seeing it any time soon. That's because the studio is still working on the tech behind it all, and plans to release two other games before it. Meaning it'll be 10-15 years before it actually comes out. 
Greene describes Artemis as an internet-like platform where users create and share things, but doesn't say specifically what those things might be. He doesn't know how his user-led "multiverse of worlds" will be moderated, or how it will prevent copyright infringement, or what makes this idea distinct from, say, Roblox. He is nonetheless "full of confidence".

There are several ways to improve your character, such as equipping yourself with good gear that you can obtain from your grind. Some of them are good, and others not so, and the Inverted Spear of Heaven definitely falls among the first.

The latest trailer is a series of sweeping yet intimate, colourful urban cross-sections, showing dozens of NPCs selling fish, shaking hands on balconies, shouldering barrels, dancing with fans, honing their feng shui, and various other pursuits that allegedly form part of full NPC life simulations. It's like scrutinising a Hitman level from above, except that all of these people have evolving relationships and sleeping patterns and they might hunt you down if you murder any of their relatives. Me, I just want to play Where's Wally.

Well folks, part of us had hoped that 2025 would mark the end of leaks and rumours regarding the upcoming 'Switch 2', but apparently not. Ahead of Nintendo's expected announcement before the end of March, new images have appeared online that seem to reveal the successor's motherboard.
Posted on Reddit by MHN1994 (who has since stated that they are not the original leaker and had actually found the images on Facebook), the post's legitimacy is certainly up for debate (though many have rightly pointed out the comparisons to a previous leak showcasing alleged prototype components of the Switch 2), but the internet has gone wild with speculation on what this means for the upcoming console regardless.

The newness of this news is in question, admittedly. Developer Lionel "Seith" Gallat and his team have been working on another helping of haunted mouseketeering since 2022. But this is the first time they've properly blogged about it, sharing details of a gruelling switchover to Unreal Engine 5 and a couple of new screens. They still haven't updated the title to make the obvious pun, but perhaps a title as pungent with whimsy as "Ghost Of A Tail" is beyond the trumpeted capabilities of Unreal Engine 5.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Starseed: Asnia Trigger is the latest addition to the world of gacha titles, and the opening week has seen the introduction of some really interesting characters.


As with any gacha, you'll want to focus on getting a strong start, and that means selecting units that are relatively overpowered in the early days. Doing so will help you clear out all the content quicker and earn more rewards in the process. During the opening week, I felt that the overall balance of the characters was decent, but some of them clearly stood out.


Starseed: Asnia Trigger tier list


To rank the characters, I have used four different tiers. While the SSR units are clearly better, you shouldn't sleep on some of the more commonly available girls as well.



S-tier: Absolutely broken units in the current meta.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Egg of the King is a vital resource to find, and doing so will allow you to upgrade Griffin in Anime Adventures.


This particular item is tied closely to the Eggs of Sacrifice that you can earn via different in-game activities. To evolve Griffin, you'll need Periapt of the King to access him first. Let's take a look at how to get this item in the first place.


How to get Egg of the King in Anime Adventures


So far, the only known way to find Egg of the King is by using a Summoning Circle. The odds will be low as it's a Mythic item. Odds-wise, you can obtain it from any available banners, but the Special one will have better chances with a 2x Mythic boost. Do note that it's a matter of luck, and you may require a lot of diamonds to make the rolls.


Unfortunately, there's no sure-shot way to obtain this item, which would certainly have been nice. Nevertheless, the item isn't tied to a time-limited event, so you can have your fair share of tries even if initially unsuccessful.




How to use the Periapt of the King in Anime Adventures


As I said earlier, the Periapt of the King is closely associated with the Eggs of Sacrifice that you can find in Anime Adventures. The Egg of the King will be available in your items stash, and you can also search for it using its name. Once you select the item and decide to use it, a red portal will open, leading you to the Griffin NPC location. From there, you can use the Eggs of Sacrifice to evolve him.


If you're unsure how to get Eggs of Sacrifice, check this guide out. As with Egg of the King, the Eggs of Sacrifice will also require concentrated efforts and a long time to find. You can also sacrifice Mythic items to quicken the process, but you'll lose those units permanently.

You walk into a poorly lit, seemingly empty hotel. In desperate need of someone to speak to, you hesitantly wander just a single room farther from the entrance, down a serene walkway. You are funnelled into a similarly poorly lit library. You’re second-guessing why you are in this hotel, and why it even has a library, yet your eye is strangely caught by a particular book among the busy shelves.

We have received previous Campaign Pick SBCs recently, but EA Sports has improved the rewards. All cards rated 84 and 85 have been removed from the rewards, and let's take a look at all the possible items that you can find after completing the challenge.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EA FC 25 has kicked off 2025 with a bang, as the New Year's Kick Off SBC is now live in Ultimate Team.


Typically, fodder challenges don't often offer amazing rewards, as they're easy to complete. The New Year's Kick Off SBC is an exception: while it still isn't challenging to get done, the reward is a Jumbo Rare Players Pack, which typically costs 100,000 coins from the in-game store. 


Let's take a look at how to complete the challenge and win the rewards. 


EA FC 25 New Year's Kick Off SBC tasks


The New Year's Kick Off SBC has a single task, and here are the conditions. 


Task 1 - New Year's Kick Off



Min. Leagues in Squad: 2


Min. Nationalities in Squad: 4


Min. 3 Players: Rare


Min. Team Rating: 78


Min. Squad Total Chemistry Points: 26



EA FC 25 New Year's Kick Off SBC solutions


The idea with this SBC is to use cards that are already available in your Ultimate Team collection. If you get stuck, feel free to use this solution to unlock your rewards. 


Task 1 - New Year's Kick Off



Fuhrich LW 79


Wright ST 72


Chaloupek 70


Demirbay CM 78


Jordi Alba 80


Tagliaferri CM 70


Rothe 72


Barnes 81


Chabot 77


Burns 70


Berger 84



There's not much to write about the Jumbo Rare Players Pack. It's easily one of the best packs to open in Ultimate Team and includes 24 Rare Gold Player items. The chances of obtaining a Walkout/promo card are high, so be sure to complete the latest fodder challenge as early as possible.

Throughout 2025, many of gaming's most treasured gems will be celebrating a significant birthday and to remind you of some of the biggest (and of just how old you are!), we've compiled this list of nearly 60 gaming dates for your calendars.
What do we mean by 'significant' birthdays? Anything that ends in a five or a zero - fairly standard stuff. 10 years is the minimum for the list below (and believe us, compiling this list had us gawping in disbelief multiple times at five-year-old games which feel like they launched six months ago - Hades cannot be five this year!) and you'll see a few games that will be heading into their fifth decade sometime in 2025.

Looking for the best new Nintendo Switch games releasing soon? Even in its twilight years, Nintendo's hybrid console is delivering, but next year could well be ushering in the successor. That doesn't mean the Switch is being left behind in 2025, though.
2024 was a quieter year for Nintendo, but it was still a busy one for the Switch. 2025 is already looking extremely healthy — we'll be kicking the year off with Donkey Kong Country Returns HD, with a Wii U favourite in Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition filling out the first quarter nicely. 2025 should also give us a brand new Pokémon game in Pokémon Legends: Z-A. But, most importantly, the long-awaited Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is due to land in 2025.

All my major choices are in there, plus a few more that I haven't played but I'd watched other people play, and had a swell time doing so.

A new piracy scare story published on Sunday takes a different approach. The extraordinary claim is that fake IPTV portals run by law enforcement are entrapping "ordinary users" to obtain evidence of their crimes. Supported by exactly zero evidence, the report claims that hundreds of internet users have already been identified.

One of the disadvantages of being news editor, you see, is that I have  developed a goldfish-grade attention span. In my hectic pursuit of the next scoop, or the next Elden Ring update changelog, I snatch and cast aside game demos like a pickpocket speedrunning the checkout line at Harvey Nichols. I'm dimly aware that some of these cast-aside games are Very Good. A few might even deserve to be played for longer than 30 minutes. I feel immensely guilty about that. Perhaps a little... existential, too. I have measured out my life in tutorial levels. 


So! Rather than digging out three of the games I've actually completed this year, such as The Crush House, Death Of A Wish and Mask Quest, I'm going to gamble on recommending a few I've barely scratched, but which sure feel excellent and have attracted a positive critical consensus. If I am false in this assessment, may Horace the Endless Bear bite my head off for my impudence. Let's begin.

The court found that Cloudflare's services are instrumental in facilitating access to live pirate streams, undermining Italy's 'Piracy Shield' legislation. The order, which applies in Italy, affects Cloudflare's CDN, DNS resolver, WARP and proxy services. It also includes a broad data disclosure section.

Here’s a shiny new package for you to unwrap, containing the first beta version of the upcoming OpenTTD 15 release. It comes faster, with road waypoints, fewer passwords, better scenario editor, and hopefully with a lot less bugs. To be a bit less vague, here are some of the highlights: Improved picker windows for stations/waypoints/objects/and more. Oh, and that does include road waypoints. Better perfomance in various places, including faster path signals that are now green by default. Password-less network authentication using keys. Several improvements for NewGRFs regarding cargo support. Better scenario editor with a town data importer and manual house placement. A large tree fully hung with ornamental bugfixes. Sadly though, not everbody was good this year. The old NPF pathfinder was finally retired, after YAPF being the superior default for many, many years now. There’s a lot of bugs left for you to find, though, guaranteed. Enjoy the beta, test all the things and report anything you find amiss, to make OpenTTD 15 the best OpenTTD 15 ever.

"Detective," she said, glaring at me with eyes like gorgeous tennis balls, "I want to open today's advent calendar door." I was confused. "Whaddya wanna do that for, missy?" She sat back, relaxed, and pulled a gun from her purse. "I need to stuff a body into it."

Historically, domain name registries have been hesitant to take action but with the right approach, progress can be made. This week, anti-piracy group BREIN reported that following their complaints, the .nl and .eu registries took action against several 'pirate' domains. On closer inspection, it appears that copyright has little to do with it.

The only thing missing from his account of the game was the bread needed to make that rich, meaty concoction a tasty, nourishing sandwich.
And by bread, I of course mean the strategic layer - the parts between the turn-based battles where you pick your next mission, improve your squads, deal with pop-up story events, appraise your standing with each NPC faction, and equip your strike cruiser with auxiliary systems. Developers Overhype have now shared a few details of how it all works. Mmmmm, such malty, yeasty strategicalness.

Is usually intended to test out the new and the strange of gaming hardware. Instead, I want to talk about mini PCs – not just small-form-factor desktops, but properly tiny, box o’ chocolates-sized computers – which have, of course, been around for decades.
Recently, however, I’ve been wondering if mini PCs are finally on the cusp of having their moment as serious games machines. Between rising desktop component prices and ever-ballooning electricity bills, it would make sense that a smaller, cheaper system would take on a new appeal, and the success of handhelds like the Steam Deck and Asus ROG Ally show that convenience still trumps out-and-out performance for a lot of PC players. There have even been hints that Valve are resurrecting their Steam Machine mini PC concept, years after a flopping first attempt. Should you be interested?

Its structure most resembles Songs of Conquest or Heroes of Might and/or Magic, but with little RPG emphasis or base building, and minimal tactical fighting.
Taxonomy is arbitrary and often unimportant at the end of the day, but I am very glad to firmly rule it out of one category: It's not a bloody card game. It looks like one, sure. You do most things with cards, and characters acquire more cards over time. But even if you absolutely, utterly, and correctly loathe card-based systems, this game has none.

It surges across the landscape until the entire population and geography of the Disc is exactly duplicated and enclosed by a shimmering shadow-self of "shining threads that followed every movement."

That's an extraordinary number and shows why countries like Italy have adopted mass site blocking measures. Logic suggests that the removal of such a huge player from the market might reduce the need for blocking measures, if only temporarily. The data shows that in the wake of the action, blocking demands significantly increased.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At any given moment I am in the center of a wonderful vortex of skeletons. Bones splash and rattle and burst out of the ground in sharp, horrible spurs. My weakest skeletons, sensing their death coming, explode into fire and shards. My strongest skeletons fight so hard and with such alacrity that upon dying, they drag their spirits together and keep fighting as ghosts for a while. Foul little bone scorpions skitter around on fans of legs made from human hands. Somewhere in the middle, almost invisible among the noise, is the character I am actually playing: Path of Exile 2’s mean-spirited, callous, and gleefully enjoyable Witch.
This is a review in progress. It has to be. Even in its incomplete early access period, Path of Exile 2 is a great sprawling mass of a game. Three meaty acts of a planned six act campaign are followed by a trickier return tour through them, before the absurd endgame kicks into gear and the real work begins. If I came to you having played everything on offer I would be wild-haired, bloodshot-eyed and possessing perfect, incomprehensible knowledge. Let’s compromise: I have toured the dark caverns and the antediluvian crypts. I have been killed by various accumulated nasties. I’ve had a great time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The announcement of The Witcher 4 with The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt's Ciri as protagonist has attracted a bit of discussion. Some of the reaction is online toddlers waxing wroth about a video game having a (somewhat older!!!) woman as lead character, and especially, shock, a video game in a series that has hitherto starred a man. And some of it is people commenting more thoughtfully on whether Ciri genuinely makes for a suitable Witcher protagonist, given that she isn't the product of the typical Witcher genetic modification regime (which is heavily tailored towards men), and given that, without spoiling too much, she has gifts that make crumbly old Geralt's sword-and-sorcery skillset look rather paltry. 


Speaking to Eurogamer this week, game director Sebastian Kalemba and narrative director Philipp Weber responded to a few of these comments, and also shared a little about Ciri's situation at the start of the game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["We are a people who honour democracy," said the dog, scratching himself. "Per our custom, you may drink of our fresh water." The dog was called Senator Umeshefaat, and he was very civil, even if he was shedding his black and white fur everywhere. We spoke in his home village at dawn. Later, I examined the senator's personal history more thoroughly and discovered he was "hated by bears for cooking them a rancid meal." I suppose every politician has their enemies. 
That Caves Of Qud creates fun anecdotes out of simple encounters shouldn't be a surprise. It has had 15 years of early access to establish itself as a small-but-mighty story generating roguelike of repute (there's a reason it sits deservedly side-by-side with Dwarf Fortress in the same publishing house). After creating many characters, and dying and dying and dying again, I understand why it grips the brain with such fierce glee. It is a machine of grand imagination and adventuresome comedy. A deceptively powerful RPG that isn't half as obtuse to newcomers as the screenshots make it out to be. Qud's low-res bark is just a complement to its bite.

Sony and Kadokawa were reported to be in talks last month, fomenting all sorts of speculation about, say, the PC version of Bloodborne being ritually sacrificed to consecrate the PS6-exclusivity of Dark Souls 4. Now, the pair have emerged from the Cave of Haggling and announced... "a strategic capital and business alliance agreement". What does this mean? Is it safe to scream yet?

Previously, on my mission to survive S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl with only wild mutants as my weapons, I’d discovered clues that someone else was attempting to tame the Zone’s beastly inhabitants. With one of their electronic tracking collars in hand and absolutely no preexisting knowledge of their location, I set out to find this kindred spirit, only for the Zone to once again slam a door in my face.
A cold, steel, very literal door to boot. It turns out that the scientist’s laboratory is locked up tight, and will remain so until I delve about twenty hours deeper into the faction war that’s bubbled up while I’ve been running around throwing irradiated rats at people in tracksuits. Fine. Fine! But I’m keeping the collar.

Since then the modding team has grown to 40 people and the scope of the mod's features has ballooned. It's now going to include new moves, stages, costumes, and a chaotic-looking 2v2 multiplayer tag team mode. All good news for biff 'em up sickos, as the mod is due to release on Friday.

In yet another hollow display of solidarity and "Liber-tea", they've teamed up with the loathsome fascists of Killzone, the elderly shooter series from Sony and Guerrilla Games.
From today, you'll be able to buy weapons, armour and cosmetics belonging to Killzone's despicable stormtroopers from the Helldivers Superstore, and there's the suggestion of an additional Killzone-themed reward depending on the fortunes of the so-called Galactic War, a xenocidal bloodbath couched as an exercise in bringing "freedom" to the upstanding socialist Automatons, the blameless wildlife of the Tyranids, and the Wellsian cosplayers of the recently added Illuminate faction.
We here at Rock Paper Shotgun stand against Super Earth and Arrowhead's wanton aggression, which absolutely isn't a big satirical joke based on some Verhoeven film or other. Anyway, those capes. Find an image and further details below.

The terror of screwing it up - together with other, more trivial distractions, like international games industry conferences - has stopped me from writing about Times Of Progress for months. Today I bite the bullet, and emerge from my lodgings to issue a hesitant speech to the masses, hoping like hell that Caesar is too preoccupied with the latest Gaul uprising to notice my errors.

And now I know: changing gears is a fucking chore. This year, in my mid-thirties, I finally learned to drive. And weirdly, a racing game about destroying clapped-out old bangers helped me along.

If you don't have stockings, a fireplace, or a pen, rest easy. I've had a word with Santa's elves, and they say it's permissible to hang a trash bag by your George Foreman grill or local equivalent, and leave a comment on an RPS article instead. Wot you want for Wintermas, then? Extra trash bags? New George Foreman grill? Whatever it is, Santa will provide. If he doesn't, I'll feed him to the Maw.

Until now, when it's seemingly returning as a foreboding, anime-infused racer about defying death, once again called simply Screamer. Huh! Huh. You'll find a trailer below.

It's like a martial art, but all you get to kick is some... ball.
I'm not sure I'll ever entirely swallow my disappointment, but credit where it's due, Rematch does look like both an enjoyable game and a quietly disruptive one. It's also struck a chord with me inasmuch as it's a new way into the culture of a sport which I have pretty mixed feelings about.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A master thief creeps over cobbles in an early modern metropolis that splits the difference between Edinburgh, Glasgow and Liverpool. Lit by gaslamps that can’t quite dispel the industrial haze, they pass for a civilian - a rough one, admittedly, but not shady enough to cause an itch in the swordarm of any passing guard.
Until, that is, they take to the thieves’ highway - following the trajectory of their grappling hook upward to the rooftops, from which they can see the shape of the city, and the moon beyond. Up here, it’s a parallel world - the trees on street level answered by chimney stacks, and the distant hills echoed by the rise and fall of steep gables. “We’re super proud of these rooftops,” says Greg LoPiccolo. “It’s an amazing landscape that we put a lot of thought and effort into, and it’s a lot of fun to traverse.”
Back in 1998, LoPiccolo was the game director who saw Thief: The Dark Project to completion. Today - after an 18 year detour to Harmonix to lead projects like Guitar Hero and Rock Band, among other adventures - he’s the game director of Thick as Thieves. “It really is an opportunity to do something unique and cool and new, on the shoulders of this stuff that is now well-respected,” he says. “Thief has some legs, right? People still talk about it to some degree.”

Who will need to please wrap it up this time? Which games will be revealed? Will there be a musical number to top last year’s Herald of Darkness performance? (That was fun, actually, fair play on that one.) You can find out right along with us, as we once again fire up the RPS liveblog-o-tron to report all the developments as they happen.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At first I thought Marvel Rivals was basically rebranded Overwatch, in the way it's a free-to-play PVP hero shooter. And in some ways, it is. Fights are like if you took a MOBA and forced both teams to bash heads constantly. Success lies in picking off Spider-Man or Squirrel Girl or Marcus Fenix so as they wait to respawn, you hop on the big area that needs capturing. Or you push the cart while tanky Hulk absorbs bullets with his biceps and John Marvel snipes from afar.
The more I played Rivals, though, the more it hit me that it's specifically a messier, more complex Overwatch. A hero shooter with a surprising amount of polish and charm, sure, but also one that slides off my brain like water off Birdman's back. I understand why it's supremely popular at the moment and yet, I really don't.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After a failure-riddled start, my attempt to turn S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2’s mutants into beasts of war is finally bearing fruit. I’ve engineered a Bloodsucker attack that wiped out the worst of villains – someone who was mean to me – and I’ve progressed far enough to really open up the map, and with it, access to more of the Zone’s fiercest fleshwarps.
Also, rats. Buoyed by the successful Bloodsucker siccing, I’m back on the trail of some mysterious anomaly scanners, and word is I might find a lead inside a local maze of wrecked cars. It’s heavily guarded by some gangster types, but for once, I won’t have to dash off in search of some far-off muties and coax them back here using my neck as bait. Mercifully, a gaggle of overgrown rodents are already hopping around right outside the labyrinth’s entrance. I beckon them in like a bouncer on his last day, then sprint past the stunned gunmen, who can barely shoulder their rifles before being set upon by a pack of giant carnivorous hamsters.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In more ways than one, today’s Total War: Warhammer 3 expansion marks a milestone for game director Rich Aldridge and his team at Creative Assembly. Omens Of Destruction’s three headline legendary lords each bring new campaigns and units for their respective factions, but it’s the fourth lord - a Khorne champion free to all players - that I imagine Aldridge will end up remembering the most fondly.
When Total War: Warhammer released back in 2016, it shipped with eight legendary lords - famous characters from Games Workshop’s fantasy setting that here act as faction leaders. The number grew steadily and, in terms of announcement order at least, today’s addition of Arbaal The Undefeated marks the series’ 100th. That's a hundred campaigns, a hundred joint efforts of game design, animation, art, writing and voice work.
Aldridge has never been shy about the team’s ambition for the series to eventually offer up each unit from every Fantasy Battle 6th edition army book ("The goal is to do everything, right?"). But ambition is one thing, and considering the fraught conditions at Creative Assembly and parent company Sega over the past few years, it’s not just the addition of the 100th lord that feels like something to celebrate. It’s taken time, effort, and a siesmic shift in update frequency, but Total War: Warhammer III is in the best place it's ever been.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If Space Marine 2's wanton devil-mulching left you hungry for more fantastical depictions of medieval zealotry, maybe take a look at Band Of Crusaders, an open-world party-based RPG in which you are the Grandmaster of a knightly order, trying to keep a bunch of wily Archdemons out of Europe. It seems to play a bit like XCOM, with an oppressive world map that is slowly encroached upon as you travel around recruiting soldiers, interacting with settlements, and picking real-time fights with hellfiends "inspired by biblical descriptions and European folklore". Naturally, parallels with real-life xenophobia and sectarian hatred abound. Here's the trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Za pár dní má v našich kinech (a po celém světě) premiéru "remasterovaná verze" kultovní animované podívané Interstella 5555. A je důležité říct si něco o tom, o jakou podívanou vlastně jde a v čem přesně spočívá ten "remaster".
U zrodu tohoto počinu stálo elektronické hudební duo Daft Punk, které v roce 2001 vydalo své album "Discovery". K písničkám z alba vyšly animované videoklipy, které produkoval Leidži Macumoto, což byl kultovní japonský výtvarník (zemřel loni), který měl na svém kontě mnoho animovaných seriálů, především ze 70. - 80. let (nejslavnější z nich byl asi "Space Battleship Yamato"). Daft Punk ho oslovili proto, že na jeho seriálech vyrůstali, takže výsledné dílo, včetně "jednodušší" retro animace a naivní zápletky zcela záměrně připomíná staré japonské televizní počiny (n…]]></summary>
