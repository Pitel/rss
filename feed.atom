        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The beauty of cards is that they can be anything. You can slap together a working game with them in a couple of minutes. Take 12 blanks, doodle some faces and landscapes, and lo, you have a procedural narrative generator. Make some duplicates, invent a few rules and lo, you have systems. 


Conversely, the great drawback of cards - especially in those roguelite deckbuilders people have been churning out since Slay The Spire - is that everything can be reduced to them. For example: last night, I played a round of Fungi with my partner, Fungi being a charming tabletop foraging sim in which you gather scrumptious chantarelles and boletus from the forest floor. This morning I resumed playing Breachway, out now in early access, in which you guide a starship through a series of wartorn solar systems, with battles unfolding as a turn-based exchange of cards corresponding to ship components.

The Razer Wolverine V3 Pro (and its wired cousin, the Wolverine V3 Tournament Edition) has looked to desktop peripherals in search of superior button-bashing, cannibalising the rather good Razer Viper gaming mouse series for its switches. The result is a high-performing, satisfyingly clicky pad that, yes, works wonderfully on PC – albeit one that rinses you for four times(!) as much as a standard Xbox controller.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Final Fantasy Pixel Remasters have finally arrived on Xbox Series X and S systems, alongside a few titles from the Mana series. On Thursday, Xbox and Square Enix announced the news during the Tokyo Game Show.


Final Fantasy Pixel Remasters' Xbox surprise launch


Players on Xbox Series X|S can now play the entire Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster series, Legend of Mana, and Trials of Mana for the first time. They launched on Thursday for the platform. While the Pixel Remaster games aren't available on Xbox Game Pass, the Mana games are.

On the bright side, you can get each classic Final Fantasy game for a discounted price for a limited time. If you don't know what the Pixel Remasters are, they are revitalized versions of Final Fantasy all the way up to Final Fantasy VI. They have new 2D pixel graphics, the option for a rearranged soundtrack, a more modern user interface, and auto-battle options. You can even turn off random encounters if you'd like and change the font.


Trials of Mana joins Xbox Game Pass


Trials of Mana is a decent entry in the long-running RPG series, and it's a remake of the third entry in the series we never got on the SNES. It's an RPG that lets you upgrade your characters' classes and learn over 300 different abilities.

Josh Talentino gave the game a 7.5/10 review for Destructoid. "In a sense, it’s an ideal remake, holding tight to the core of what made the original game (and the Mana series as a whole) so compelling to so many people at the time, while bringing a novelty and freshness to attract neophytes like yours truly," Talentino wrote. Despite Trials of Mana initially skipping the Xbox, the game shipped over one million copies worldwide when it launched on PS4, Switch, and PC.

Those who were particularly intrigued by Witchfire have probably already been playing it over on the Epic Games Store, where it made its exclusive debut. The game's production pipeline has recently expanded to include Steam, too, and the full release is now finally on the horizon.

The Survey Scope, when equipped, increases the drop rate of Smoothie ingredients and Monster Stones. The Survey Binoculars do the same, except at a higher rate.

A new Californian law will come into effect in 2025 that will effectively force digital storefronts to disclose that buyers don't actually own their digital puchases, but rather simply licensing the content.
Naturally, we suspect that most of our audience will already be aware of this, but it's entirely possible that more casual gamers will not be privy to the way that digital storefronts function. Effectively, then, as reported by The Verge (thanks, Time Extension) digital storefronts will be restricted from using the words "buy, purchase, or any other term which a reasonable person would understand to confer an unrestricted ownership interest in the digital good or alongside an option for a time-limited rental."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As befits the “very normal gardening game” that puzzly mystery box Grunn winkingly bills itself as, the first tool I obtained was a pair of shears. The second tool I obtained was a trumpet. It doesn’t really work like a trumpet, and it does things no regular trumpet could or should do. I got a trowel next. Here’s the thing about the trowel: it’s a pretty good trowel. Nothing fancy. But recently, I keep digging up… objects. Objects most peculiar. I’ve got the weekend to sort this garden, and a cosy little shed to sleep in, so I really should just get on with it. Again, though, I must reiterate: I keep digging up… objects.
I go to clean some rubbish from the bathroom. I interact with the mirror and the game says: “You do not see anything in the mirror”. I take a note that says: I do not see anything in the mirror. I check the game again and no, I still do not see anything in the mirror. Sure it’s fine. Just a shit mirror, probably. They should get it replaced. What good is a mirror you can’t see anything in?

You can hold four utility items at a time, meaning you've got to choose which ones you'll be taking into a round.


Strong utility usage separates the good from the great Counter-Strike 2 players. Knowing the right way to use these items can be the difference between winning and losing a match, so it's crucial to know what each piece of utility does.

This is just your typical grenade, useful for chipping away at your opponent's HP throughout a round. While most useful against unarmored opponents, you can still expect to deal almost 60 damage with a direct hit against full armor.

There's plenty of depth to be found here, and the 1.0 build of the game features body-dragging, some new suspect interactions, and a bunch of other goodies.

I’m only realizing now that we skipped a year in this often-annual series. Unless you count the mobile-focused, free-to-play Atelier Resleriana: Forgotten Alchemy and the Polar Night Liberator. I don’t, because I prefer to push knowledge of that sector of video games out of my brain, but I suppose Koei Tecmo and Gust do since The Red Alchemist & The White Guardian is set in the same world.




We don’t know much about it at this point beyond the short teaser trailer. It’s also going to be a paid, single-player, console-focused, offline game. Beyond that, the press release says, “this …]]></summary>

But Echoes aren’t the only power Zelda has, even if they are the most impressive. Zelda receives another special ability, Bind, and with it, she can move objects anywhere she wants. Here’s how you unlock the Bind ability, and how to use it.


How to get the Bind ability in Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom


The Bind ability can be unlocked inside the first dungeon you’ll enter in the game, the Suthorn Ruins, inside of the first Rift. The game will naturally direct you to where you need to go, so you don’t need to worry about missing it.

Bungie revealed a slew of Super and ability changes, most of which are flat-out buffs.


While Titans are getting some extra love in the form of a Class identity rework, Hunters and Warlocks won't be completely left out of the fun. Bungie typically does a mid-expansion weapon and ability balance update, and it appears Episode: Revenant will kick off the process.

Hyrule Ranch location in Zelda Echoes of Wisdom

To reach Hyrule Ranch, head north from Lueberry's house. When you run into the two guards discussing Zelda's whereabouts, go west. Follow the path as it starts going south and it will lead you to the ranch.


How to find the missing horse in Zelda Echoes of Wisdom


Screenshot by Destructoid


At the ranch speak with the old man near the house to initiate the Runaway Horse side quest. After that, go straight West from the man, using echoes to hop over the ranch's fence. You'll find a path leading straight to the horse after hopping the second fence. 


The horse will be stuck on a piece of land surrounded by water. To help the horse escape, place an old bed echo over the water to create a bridge. Ride the horse back over to the ranch and talk to the old man to complete the side quest. 


Your reward for returning the horse is that the ranch will now loan out horses to you for free. Go up to the horse you want and hop on to loan them. Horses are faster than Zelda, can hop over obstacles, and can defeat enemies by dashing into them. The only horse you can't take is the white one with the yellow mane.

If you're here, you've likely met the Gerudo woman who longs for a tumbleweed. To assist her, here's a guide on how to complete the Elusive Tumbleweeds quest in The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom. 


The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom Elusive Tumbleweeds quest guide


Any time you try to approach a tumbleweed in the Gerudo Desert, you'll likely destroy it with a single touch. Fortunately, there is a way to keep it intact, satisfying the Elusive Tumbleweed quest. To do this, use Bind on the tumbleweed by pressing the 'X' button, similar to Tears of the Kingdom's Ultrahand. Select the target with the 'ZR' trigger to make the process more accessible.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Legendary Brawler, Kenji, has sliced his way over to Brawl Stars, expanding the dynamic Assassin class. While he's already a formidable fighter, the potential of a well-crafted build can elevate his performance to new heights. Here's how to create the best Kenji build in Brawl Stars.


What is the best build for Kenji in Brawl Stars?


The premium store lets you unlock Kenji early, ahead of his free-to-play launch around Oct. 3. Equip the following items to get the best Kenji build in Brawl Stars:



Gadget: Hosomaki Healing


Star Power: Nigiri Nemesis


Gear: Damage


Gear 2: Gadget Charge 



When comparing Kenji's two Gadgets, the Hosomaki Healing is the clear choice. It'll provide you with 75 percent healing for over three seconds, giving you a second chance even if your health is low. You'll improve his survivability further using the Nigiri Nemesis. The Star Power offers a 90 percent damage reduction with the next enemy attack. But, you must avoid damage for five seconds in exchange for the ability.


The Gadget and Star Power almost make Kenji feel like an unstoppable force. And it'll get even better once you place some Gear on him. Since we've mainly tackled Kenji's defensive capacity, it's time to enhance his attacks.

Use the Damage Gear to gain 15 percent extra damage any time his health is 50 percent. Last but not least is the Gadget Charge, increasing the usage of the Hosomaki Healing during a match. You could also go for Speed instead to make him run faster. Of course, the choice is entirely up to you, so utilize the Gear items that better suit your playstyle.


Before you step onto the battlefield, test out this Brawl Stars Kenji build in the Practice Match or Training Grounds. Then, you can start dominating the leaderboards with his trusty sword. If you want to try out more characters, be sure to check out our builds for Moe and Frank.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a recent talk with director Alex Garland for Famitsu that got caught by Automaton Media, Hideo Kojima spilled a few interesting details about the upcoming Death Stranding movie adaptation.


“Many of the offers I received [for Death Stranding’s movie adaptation] from other film companies proposed big-budget adaptations with extravagant explosions, but I didn’t want that. Together with A24, I want to make a slightly different film,” Kojima stated.


Death Stranding is being co-produced by A24, an entertainment company with a varied filmography under its belt. So far, it has been behind titles including Ex Machina, The VVitch, Pearl, Hereditary, and Best Picture Oscar winner Everything Everywhere All At Once. 


On top of the studio's eclecticism that Kojima will surely use to let his imagination go wild, A24 is also a company known for doing a lot with little.




Still, Kojima had some apprehensions. “With Civil War becoming a huge hit, I have a feeling that A24 is raising the budget and scale [of Death Stranding], so I’m thinking about how to suppress that.”


Either way, Kojima stated that A24 has a unique presence in the industry, one that aligns with the vision of Kojima Productions, saying, “it will take time, but it will turn out well.” He also joked that A24 is probably the right choice, as his birthday is on August 24.


Kojima wanted to make it in movies before pivoting to the video game industry, and while he could have used this opportunity to finally jump in the director's seat, he decided to stick to a producer role. We still don't know who'll direct Death Stranding or when it'll come out, but, funnily enough, it'll likely see the light of day before the Metal Gear Solid movie adaptation. 


As for the game sequel, Death Stranding 2: On The Beach, is set to release sometime in 2025.

At first glance, Bloomtown: A Different Story looks like a charming addition to the world of slice-of-life RPGs, with its cosy pixel art style and comforting soundtrack.
It kicks off with two siblings, Emily and Chester, being sent to their grandad’s house for summer break in the 1960s. They’re frustrated about going, complaining that there’ll be nothing to do in sleepy Bloomtown and that they’d rather stay in Chicago. As soon as they start settling in, though, it becomes apparent that Bloomtown has a lot more to it than initially meets the eye.

The Class is getting a substantial overhaul as part of an effort to add more identity and playstyle options. The best part is that it'll go live alongside Episode: Revenant on October 8.


Over time, Destiny 2 Titans have found themselves in a bit of a pickle. While the Class can do things that none other can, like a Ward of Dawn dome barrier Super or consume a grenade to create a mobile shield, the game doesn't actively reward defensive play. For Warlocks and Hunters, the Classes have evolved to allow players to eliminate enemies nearly as soon as they appear.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you've been on the Internet at all, you've seen the "This is Fine" dog, also known as Question Hound. KC Green (Gunshow, HE IS A GOOD BOY) is the artist behind it, and he just launched a crowdfunding campaign for Question Hound's very own platformer.


The Kickstarter for the appropriately titled This is Fine: Maximum Cope went live earlier today with a goal of US$50,000. The campaign video includes some footage of the platformer in action, but Green is quick to remind everyone that the assets and video are in the early prototype stage. Still, it already has some cute animations and you can kind of see what they're going for in the video below. 




This is Fine: Maximum Cope has players traversing worlds based on very real anxieties, including Humiliation, Fear, Failure, Loss, and Regret. In addition to taking on enemies that embody everyday worries, you'll have to face off against larger Anxiety Bosses. Defeating them and capturing their essence in a Worry-Box will net you new abilities that help Question Hound head into new areas.


Speaking of the dog at the center of it all, most of his abilities so far have to do with his trusty hat. He can toss it, shrink it small enough to fit inside it, and even use it as a boat. He can also use his tail as a helicopter and fire off a bark blast. 


No really, this is fine! 


Screenshot via Kickstarter Campaign


KC Green is working with Numskull Games on this one. Reward tiers include a digital copy of the game, the physical release, a collector's edition, t-shirt bundle, and so on. The "Big One" is a $1,500 tier that includes everything else plus an in-game cameo featuring Green's illustration of you. 


This will probably be fully funded in the coming hours. When This is Fine: Maximum Cope eventually launches — it's currently eyeing a March 2026 delivery — it should be available on PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, and Steam.

By putting the company's history on display, Miyamoto hopes visitors will see just how much Nintendo marches to the beat of its own drum — and how that can be a really great thing to do.

It has been a while since we’ve seen Professor Layton and his protege Luke. For a while, the mind-bending puzzle series seemed like a Nintendo mainstay - at least on the DS and 3DS. The last game starred Katrielle Layton, the daughter of the titular Professor, and received rather mixed reviews when it came out for 3DS in 2017 and on Switch a couple of years later in Deluxe form.
This makes Professor Layton and the New World of Steam, releasing sometime in 2025, not only the first series entry for a while but also a return-to-the-roots adventure with the Professor himself back in the leading role, meaning we were especially looking forward to trying it out on the show floor at this year’s Tokyo Game Show.

Speaking as both a news editor and a former paperboy, who broke his mind and body hauling obese Sunday editions to the millionaire houses at the top of the valley, Paperboy is my role model. Or he would be if my role model weren't actually Steven Spielberg's Freakazoid. Paperboy's heyday has long since passed into history, however, and the business of journalism has changed beyond recognition. People don't read newspapers anymore, they just eat pizza.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wartorn sci-fi extraction shooter The Forever Winter has had a messy launch into early access. For those who don't know the game, this third-person helljaunt sees its players wandering through the battlefields of an endless conflict between three major world powers. Mechs stomp past you, ignoring you in favour of decimating enemy soldiers. Bug-like drones hover overhead, scanning for prey. And horrifying mommy harvesters scavenge bodies from the debris. As a collection of imagery, it's powerful stuff. As a game that you can play (with up to three pals) it is very rough, and not just around the edges.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is war.
Despite the sheer wealth of Worms titles over the years (most of which are, at the very least, decent), most fans would argue that the series reached its peak fairly early with the immaculate Worms Armageddon in 1999. Indeed, it’s quite telling that, of all the possible games to revisit, this is the one that Team17 and Digital Eclipse have decided to spruce up for the Nintendo Switch.
We’re almost certain that those who played the original, extensively or otherwise, will already have an inkling of how this Anniversary Edition turned out. In short, it’s flippin’ great. This is the Worms Armageddon you know and love, with every mode included from the original release alongside a generous selection of documentary features detailing the creation and development of the franchise. If that’s not enough, you also get immediate access to the emulated Game Boy Color release, rounding out a clean, extensive presentation of a turn-based strategy classic.

I'm glad, so here's another. Cold And Afraid is a murder mystery that aims to channel the 1990s with chunky characters and lots of lovely dithering. You play a detective out to stop a serial killer with a grisly pattern who's preying on the young women of an unnamed US city. On top of the obligatory tank controls, it aims to have "consequential dialogue choices" and a "Time Event system where you must meet certain people at specific times to forward different story threads". Ah, forgive me, you're here to see the chunky limbs. Here's a recent trailer that shows 'em.

Treyarch, Raven Software and Activision have popped up a note-to-players covering a range of improvements they're making to Call Of Duty: Black Ops 6 in the aftermath of August's beta.

But if there's a type of game they're known for, it's engineering puzzles and factory games.

It looks very picturesque and, like its predecessor, inspired by the Kurosawa showdowns of old. You can see for yourself in the trailer that acted as the finale of Sony's marketing show.

One of the leading examples of that is around the NVIDIA Mellanox networking driver support. With Linux 6.12 they've landed a new feature that has been described as "a sign of things to come, I think we will see more of this in the next 10 years."..]]></summary>

This is the same Behaviour Interactive who recently laid off a bunch of people, cancelled a game and closed a studio, Midwinter Entertainment, after bagging themselves a bunch of developers (the others are SockMonkey, Codeglue and Fly Studio) over the past two years. Darkest Dungeon is a horror game like DBD, so I guess the acquisition chimes from that perspective. All the same, my snap judgement is "yikes".

This is just the beginning of a lot of Granite Rapids benchmarks to come on Phoronix. Compared to the existing AMD EPYC competition and prior generation Intel Xeon processors, the Xeon 6900P series performance surpassed my expectations and has debuted as an incredibly strong performer. In some areas of HPC and other workloads, Intel is able to regain leadership performance with Granite Rapids paired with MRDIMMs. In AI workloads where the software is optimized for AMX, the new Xeon 6900P CPUs can showcase staggering leads.]]></summary>

Said remaster project was rumoured earlier this year, when Sarafan scouts caught sight of a telltale plaque at San Diego Comic-Con. Consider that rumour strongly trending towards the status of a Real Thing, because Sony are in the habit of publishing Real Things, and they've just (accidentally, I guess) popped a bunch of screens and a trailer with a release date - 10th December 2024 - on the PlayStation website.

It's fun to write about Spiders, because you get to frighten people for a moment, before they realise you're talking about the game development studio, Spiders. They have just released GreedFall 2: The Dying Land into early access. For those who don't remember the first GreedFall, it was a colonial-styled RPG about landing on the magical shores of another continent and getting into scrapes with monsters and frontiersfolk. This time the story is furthering the fantasy Columbian exchange by putting you in the role of a native who's been uprooted against their will and taken to the "old world". The game's release comes against a backdrop of dissatisfaction in the studio. But workers have gained some concessions in talks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For years, a dangerous and charismatic game has evaded the grasp of many designers. Some say it doesn't exist, that no publisher would ever back it. I'm talking about the one city block RPG that Warren Spector has often mentioned. Sure, we've seen a few usual suspects already - Deus Ex Mankind Divided, Disco Elysium, even Else: Heart.Break - they all grimace in the line-up but nothing ever sticks. Now, out of the gloom of indie development, comes another perp ready to have his mugshot taken. Shadows Of Doubt is an open world detective sim that comes perilously close to being our guy. Its clothes, stature, gait, and fingerprints match the description of what Spector often describes. And yet, if you tilt your head, something is just a little off. The game isn't confined to one block. It's not an RPG precisely. And its simulation has plenty of bugs, jank, and unintentional comedy. But after all this time, in the absence of a smoking gun, shouldn't we just put this guy in the slammer and call the case closed? I say yes, let's. Officers! Arrest this game, it's brilliant.

If you really want to showcase your knowledge, though, you may want to mention that dinosaurs may have actually fought with large swords lodged between their teeth. Dinoblade demonstrates this! And no, they haven't discovered swords alongside dinosaur fossils yet because palaeontologists have been unlucky thus far. "Soon", you tell them.

Nomada Studios have, incredibly, thrust their hands into my chest cavity and given me a blood-pumping mechanism. Having spent some time with upcoming action-platformer Neva (the game) and Neva (the dog from the game), I have to admit: I did enjoy petting Neva (the dog).

It’s hard not to be moved by the exaggerated kineticism of it all – the magic-enhanced swordfights, the jumping off cliffs and turning into a flying shadow monster, the ability to drift horses. Yes. Yes!
I’m therefore somewhat unnerved to report that my enthusiasm has been tempered significantly by actually playing it. I’ve since used all the straws I’ve clutched at to spell out "It’s just a demo" on my floor, but the fear remains that Crimson Desert’s fantastical open-world exploration is going to be interrupted by regular bouts of twangy, unwieldy, unsatisfying combat.

I’ve done this many, many times, but on this occasion there was a surprising twist, one which would have notorious pearl-clutching racist HP Lovecraft spinning in his grave. Enotria: The Last Song’s arcane Soulslike language is actually just Italian.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed is a remaster of Disney Epic Mickey, a cult classic 3D platformer first released a decade ago on the Wii. In the original you controlled the titular Mickey Mouse who, armed with a magical paintbrush (wieldable by waving the Wiimote about), could paint or rub out surfaces to solve puzzles. It was the work of Junction Studios led by Warren Spector, best known for being The Deus Ex Guy. No, sadly Mickey could not nano-augment his brush for better target acquisition, nor project laser-guided anti-tank rockets from his podgy white mitts.
And no, Rebrushed doesn't let him do anything of these either. Clearly a missed opportunity. But is it better nonetheless? With an updated look, some added secrets, more moves for Mickey, and controller/M&K support, I'd say longtime Mickey heads will adore this nostalgia trip. For total newcomers like me, I'd say it's a platformer that's certainly charming and clever and wonderfully experimental, but a bit flat in places too.

Writing of the frigid framing of Clockwork Orange’s atrocities, the film critic Pauline Kael asked: “is there anything sadder - and ultimately more repellent - than a clean-minded pornographer?” The lavishly directed and animated universe of God Of War Ragnarok is far from repellent, but it also feels spiritually squeegeed; a world of pulpy violence so chirpy and chaste as to strain belief that the scars that haunt its reformed anti-hero could have ever been inflicted there.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier in the month, we learned that Stray and Neon White publisher Annapurna Interactive’s entire staff resigned after a dispute with boss Megan Ellison. Reported by Bloomberg as a disagreement over attempts to "spin off the video-game division as an independent entity," the details were nonetheless somewhat scant. A  new report from Rebekah Valentine at IGN has since shed some more light on the walkout, which reportedly involved “disagreements over the direction of the Interactive division, chaotic departures, communication breakdowns, and a perceived lack of leadership transparency.” It’s a thorough account of some messy events I recommend reading in full, but here’s a brief rundown.

You couldn’t injure yourself on those scythes if you tried. It’s polearm-ical correctness gone mad! Well, good news if you’re nostalgic for a simpler time, where tiny scythes could maim you for life, and binary digits came in lots of eight and not a binary digit more. RPG Beyond Shadowgate is a vastly-expanded, modernised sequel to the classic NES adventure, created by the original’s designers, and it just released last week.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's a pirate's life for me, and it's a pirate's life for Goro Majima, recurring eyepatched anti-hero of the used-to-be-called-Yakuza series. He's the star of the just-announced Like A Dragon: Pirate Yakuza In Hawaii, a game I can only applaud for the brazen straightforwardness of its title. Whatever Sega were drinking when they signed off on Metaphor: ReFantazio, they were not drinking when they signed off on this. They were definitely drinking something, though. Here's the reveal trailer.

Yet like a flask of mead laced with Odin’s raven piss, the seemingly crisp treat of Ragnarök’s handheld performance masks a nasty blend of technical troubles and what is, essentially, an always-online requirement by stealth.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[“We have been sold this myth for a very long time that unions have to be for blue collar workers in an industrial setting in the early 1900s,” Autumn Mitchell tells me. “The very simple definition of a union is just you and your co-workers coming together and forming a collective body. You can do that anywhere.”
A QA tester with Zenimax currently on union leave, Mitchell joined the Communications Workers Of America (CWA) as a full-time organiser after she and her colleagues formed what was, at the time, the biggest union in videogames - ZeniMax Workers United. Now she helps the CWA do what they did for her and her colleagues at Zenimax: provide support, training, resources and guidance for workers in the videogame industry who have decided, for whatever reason, that they want to unionise.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm reasonably sure Final Fantasy 16 isn't the longest Final Fantasy I've ever played, but it feels that way, for a multitude of reasons. The major one is that a lot of its quests exist to create distance between places and plot beats. They are overwritten errands such as bringing people lunch or fetching herbs or carrying letters - dessicated, MMO-ish fare, thrust into a moderately enjoyable action-RPG for the sake of incremental worldbuilding and scale.

It's a landscape of wonder and pain, and it's about to get a little more wonderful and painful. The upcoming Watcher expansion, which adds new places to visit and a new type of slugcat to play as, will be coming out early next year, say the developers. There's a trailer to say so. Look at this slippery gastropodal feline, standing calmly in the rain, as if the torrential and lethal weight of the water will not crush that little fuzzy head. The gall!

But hey, at least the next management game in the growing 2.universe now has a release date: March 4th, 2025.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fifteen months on from its PS5 release, Final Fantasy XVI – that actiony RPG of emo-fringed hack ‘n’ slashing and disquietingly sexy Ralph Ineson characters – is now on PC. Enough time, you’d think, to do a proper job of rejigging it with Windows spanners, especially after Final Fantasy XV’s port got so much stick for its lack of features and performance issues.
FFVXI does make some improvements, adopting a full set of DLSS and FSR upscalers and frame generators, and its mouse and keyboard integration feels generally slicker than XV. Sadly, it’s still no first-rate adaptation, neglecting numerous PC features and giving low-end systems an even deeper kick in the plums. Cutting the quality settings can help, as per the guide down below, but overall performance is so up-and-down than you’ll likely never achieve a perfectly smooth ride.

It’s a turn-based battler with an empire-building component in which you play as several emperors in succession, passing on abilities and knowledge to your heir. In what I consider to be a poetic complementary flourish, you can also pass on save data from the demo to the full game. Look, this is what counts as “poetic” just before lunch on a Thursday.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[How many bones have you broken? It sucks, the snapping sound they make is impolite. I prefer to break virtual, non-corporeal bones. Slackers: Carts Of Glory looks like a co-conspirator in this endeavour. It's basically that one bit in Jackass where the gang blast downhill in shopping trollies at great risk to their bodily and mental health, as is their wont. The arcade racing game came out yesterday and features online multiplayer, so you can break someone else's bones too. Let's see it in action.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lethal Company was one of last year's surprise horror hits. It was a brilliant dystopian scavenging sim in which you searched cellars for bolts while avoiding the attentions of creatures that hate being looked at, or which only move when they're not being looked at, or which look like your friends, from a distance. The developer's next game, Welcome To The Dark Place, is more about hearing. It's an "open-world, auditory text-based adventure" which mostly takes place in pitch blackness.

While it has fewer years under its belt, pirate IPTV service Magis TV is under attack from all sides. The latest broadside in Argentina will see the country's ISPs block around 70 domains, but that's just the tip of the iceberg. The Alliance for Creativity and Entertainment has seized a similar number yet Magis TV has somehow managed to stay afloat.

The sidescrolling metroidvania is a rich, expansive, and surprisingly challenging take on a genre typically dominated by indies, and it's precisely the kind of game I wish mega-publishers produced more.

It's also now got a story expansion, Mask Of Darkness, which came out yesterday.

I then combed through several thousand comments below said video, many of which expressed similar longing for the hypothetical Good Old Days, before those wily feminists invaded the medium, transformed every game into a LGBT+ weeping simulator, and threw all the Real Men into a big hole. I did this because I was searching for one particular comment written by somebody claiming to be Matthew Karch, CEO of Space Marine 2 developers Saber Interactive.

This is probably a disservice to the hero of colourful metroidvania Marko: Beyond Brave, who a quick goog tells me may be based on Krali Marko - a popular character in the folklore of Studio Mechka’s native Bulgaria. Folk hero or not, Marko certainly has some heroic facial hair: his moustache floweth so bountifully that it can’t be contained in his character portrait. Extremely powerful of him.

According to EA, it’ll be the “final chapter" in the now-trilogy, following 2019’s Jedi Fallen Order and 2023’s Jedi Survivor.
The existence of the game was first confirmed by Cal Kestis actor Cameron Monaghan, during an Ocala Comic Con panel. “We’re working on a third and we’re in the process of doing that right now,” said Monaghan, which is about as straightforward an affirmative as one could want. It was also double-confirmed this February, following news of layoffs at EA, via Eurogamer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Frostpunk 2 was an ambitious gambit. With survival achieved, and the introduction's excellently sinister advisor whispering evil Tory ideas, the whole city you built in Frostpunk is now just the headquarters for a sprawling expansion effort, and your rule is no longer absolute. Rather than retread the same "prepare for ultra-Winter" ground, your biggest obstacle will likely be your own people, now formed into shifting political parties, and looking outward with colonial eyes. The result is a complicated, laborious survival citybuilder that's two parts compelling, and one part frustrating for the wrong reasons.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I really wanted to like action adventure The Plucky Squire more than I do now, having given its charming 2D to 3D platforming a proper whirl. Yes, it's lovely to look at. Yes, hopping out of a storybook and making friends with an illustration on a coffee mug is cool. And yes, everyone can have a mildly fun time with its puzzles and fights. But that's the problem: who is everyone? At first I thought, "This game is for young kids and that's fine!", given its relative simplicity. Then I hit some puzzles and thought, "Ain't no kid figuring this out".
Then it hit me. It struggles to balance the fine line between being approachable for tiny tots and layered enough for people who've graduated from "goo goo ga ga" to "oo oo aa aa my back hurts". And that's down to how plucky you're allowed to squire at any given time, because it can be surprisingly limited and, sadly, a bit underwhelming.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You can't travel back to the 1980s. But what if I told you it was possible to gently warp your memories of that time? UFO 50 is a kart of 50 games that once existed for an old computer system, all lovingly restored by a gang of coders. The old console, of course, is a fiction. The LX-I never existed. But it's a fun pseudo-history against which to create a grab bag of small games (some throwaway, others mighty) all designed with a distinct 80s look. It's an exercise in adhering to an aesthetic. Like an oil painter working with a limited range of colours, the developers of this bundle have stuck to a 32-colour equivalent of the Zorn palette. Yet play a little of each game, and you start to sense the smirk of chronos. These games aren't stuck in the past, but they are enjoying a holiday there.

Namely, that the majority of its pre-release buzz has centred around its proximity to Persona, and not its far more entertaining quality of having the most gleefully bizarre RPG enemy design this side of Elden Ring’s horn-tooting orbpeople.

        <updated>2024-09-17T14:37:14.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Why is every blockbuster video game now some kind of live service game? Speaking as a clueless idiot, the explanation I find most convincing is that it's an attempt to bridge the gap between the returns publishers want from video games, versus how much we're able or willing to pay upfront. "Triple-A" projects now cost exorbitant sums to develop, partly thanks to wider economic inflation, but also because publishers have spent decades teaching players that every sequel has to be More and Shinier. Premium game prices have not risen in proportion, and investors want growth, as they do.
Live service games sneak around this difficulty by dragging out the time we spend playing them. Whether premium or free-to-play, they seek to install themselves as habits by means of regular, planned updates and additions. This is time that can be monetised by way of a subscription model, time in which other products may be sold to you, like skins and paintjobs, and time that becomes a commodity in itself, "engagement", which can be transmuted and exploited to various end. I'm not sure it's ever been expressed this way in any press release boast about longevity, but the unspoken principle/logical extrapolation seems to be that ideally, a live service game should keep us plugged in and plugging away till we die.

        <updated>2024-09-17T14:08:37.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Strange Scaffold’s newly released FPS I Am Your Beast is very fun for quite a few reasons, but chief among them is a deep appreciation for the poetry of good videogame violence. I’m not using the big P word just to throw out an overly worthy comparison to something we might associate with craft or beauty, but as a nod toward the game’s playful application of what I previously called ‘a euphoric splurge of murderous game verbiage’ one morning where I had clearly eaten my wordy Weetabix. The way its hurled knives and curb stomps and inexplicable decapitations flow together have an assonant, almost Suessian quality to them.
But it’s also, well, just a bit like Mad Libs. You play as Harding, a man who’s mythical lethality is established very early on. The showing is there in the moment to moment, but the telling is conveyed through cute tricks like how everyone you meet is so deeply afraid of Harding that they loudly keep track of exactly what weapon he’s holding at all times. The Mad Libs comes in through the fact that you can draw Harding a route between A and B, and it’s a given that multiple heads are going to come unstuck from necks along the way. You’re sort of just casually filling in the verbs that seem the most fun to you in the moment. One of the verbs is ‘hornet’. Hornet is a verb now.

Developers Proletariat, Inc announced plans to yank the servers back in August 2022 in the course of being acquired by Activision Blizzard, bringing an end to many happy hours spent skating on conjured ice ramps and hurling boulders around like bunny rabbits. Yes, I am the kind of wizard who hurls a bunny rabbit, if there are no boulders to spare.
Happily, it transpires that Proletariat have resurrected their creation and handed it over to posterity in the shape of a free standalone Community Version, available on Itch.io. You’ll need to host your own server or join another group if you want to play multiplayer, but all the same, this is a lovely gift and one I’m delighted to transmit unto you, the active and efficient Magenauts of Rockus Paperus Shottegonne.

Despite this, actual vampire-themed immersive sims are rare. My list starts with Vampire: the Masquerade: Bloodlines... and sort of ends there. In a devastating betrayal, Arkane Austin's Redfall wasn't an immersive sim but an open world co-op shooter (a not very good one). The much-delayed Bloodlines 2 was recently downgraded from immersive sim to RPG by new developers The Chinese Room. Arkane Lyon's Blade adaptation seems promising, but it's a ways off. 


Here to paper over the immersive vamping gap in the market is Byte Barrel's Trust, "a new first-person shooter with immersive sim elements". It takes place in a world where the vampires are hunted for their blood, which has become an everyday human energy source, used for everything from car batteries to streetlights. The irony!

Anyway, here's the trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[British musician Eddy Grant has prevailed in his copyright infringement lawsuit against Donald Trump and his 2020 campaign team over their infringing use of the iconic track 'Electric Avenue'. After consuming four years of Grant's life, the case turned on a fair use defense; under scrutiny of the court, it effortlessly failed to convince on any of the four factors that combine to indicate a permitted, non-infringing use of a copyright work.
