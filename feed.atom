        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Massively multiplayer games rapidly calcified around a specific set of design ideas (eg. World Of Warcraft) and so many other attempts to jam a load of players onto a single server quickly disappeared (eg. most games by Improbable or Amazon). 

Foxhole is one of the few to do it successfully: a single, massive World War 2 battlefield in which players don't just fight at the frontlines, but form supply routes, build defenses, and otherwise take the reigns of the logistics of war. After five years in early access, Foxhole released version 1.0 today.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A local village for local people
Anybody fancying a little bit of a slow burn scare this weekend would do to take a look at Cloak & Dagger Games' latest release, The Excavation of Hob's Barrow, now available on PC via Steam and GOG.com.
Seeped in folk horror vibes and sporting an aesthetic reminiscent of the golden age of the Commodore Amiga, The Excavation of Hob's Barrow is the tale of author and antiquarian Thomasina Bateman, who is traveling the length and breadth of the countryside to explore the many barrows of Victorian England.
https://youtu.be/x-1C_9RQJb8
While her travels so far have brought about many interesting sights and characters, Bateman's arrival in the little-known village of Bewlay sees her research expedition take a particularly dark turn — with our intrepid hero becoming mired in a world of unanswered questions, ancient cultures, and living nightmares, as she delves deeper into the village and its highly unnerving community.
Choosing atmosphere, mood, and impending dread over the genre's well-worn trope of tired jump scares, The Excavation of Hob's Barrow blends mystery, exploration, and a sense of ancient malevolence to weave its tale, beckoning the player in with its intriguing locale, creepy cast of characters, and plucky, daring protagonist. It looks to be a real sleeper hit of the year, and well worth checking out for those who like their ghostly goings-on a little on the psychological side.
The Excavation of Hob's Barrow is available now on PC via Steam and GOG.com.

Headed to Nintendo Switch on November 15, Smurfs Kart will see the garden-dwelling dopes take to the racetrack in a variety of ramshackle vehicles, all seemingly made from the shit they just had lying around, (although Smurfette seems to have built herself a pretty snazzy roadster, at least when compared to most of the abominations on display).

You might've already dipped in, but if not — or if you're fine doubling up — then it's good to know that a physical edition of Cuphead is on the way from iam8bit and Studio MDHR.
As shared on Twitter, the Cuphead physical edition is "coming soon" to Nintendo Switch, PS4, and Xbox One. The DLC, The Delicious Last Course, will be included on the disc, which isn't always the case but would've been egregious in this situation — it's so crucial.
As for regional releases, "Cuphead will come to retail with ESRB, PEGI, USK, and ACB versions," according to iam8bit.
https://twitter.com/iam8bit/status/1575470762235875329
The distributor is taking "keep me in the loop" email sign-ups today — but no word on release timing yet. With how widespread the Cuphead brand has become, I'm sure there will be plenty of opportunities to snag a physical copy at a reasonable price.
An eventual spiffy collector's edition would be great to see as well — there's so much art to consider — but an all-inclusive standard physical release is a good step.
It's truly one of my favorite games of the last decade, and for many of us, even folks who have moved mostly to digital, it's worth adding to the physical collection.

The second I began Shovel Knight Dig, it felt like returning home. As someone who hadn’t played most of Shovel Knight’s post-launch DLC, the last time I touched this series was nearly a decade ago. Gaining control of the titular character immediately felt familiar, and my old Shovel Knight habits returned to greet this new take on the series, led by developer Nitrome this time. The moment-to-moment experience plays excellently, in part because it’s more Shovel Knight with some well-designed gameplay twists. However, the game’s venture into roguelite territory feels i…]]></summary>

The two Bayonetta Switch games just got a version 1.1.0 patch (1, 2), mostly to shore things up language-wise (Korean, and traditional/simplified Chinese) ahead of the release of Bayonetta 3 in October — as well as the debut of the first Bayonetta on Switch in physical form.
Due out on September 30 (mine already shipped!), a $30 physical edition of the original game will be released, said to be "limited in number" by Nintendo directly. Interestingly enough, the Masquerade Edition of Bayonetta 3 will have three sleeves, which will allow you to store the first entry in it.
It's a flood of Bayonetta-related news! It's weird to think that this series debuted in 2009 (!), and it's still alive and kicking today. It just speaks to the overall quality of it, as some of Platinum's best work to date: and two of the best technical action games of all time. Hopefully Bayonetta 3 will complete the trifecta.
Bayonetta Switch Version 1.1.0 ［September 29, 2022］
General
Added support for Korean, Chinese (simplified), and Chinese (traditional) as in-game display and subtitle languages.
*Voice support languages ​​are Japanese and English only.
Bayonetta 2 Switch Version 1.1.0 ［September 29, 2022］
General
Added support for Korean, Chinese (simplified), and Chinese (traditional) as in-game display and subtitle languages.
*Voice support languages ​​are Japanese and English only.
*The latest update data is required to play online elements.
*Local communication is not compatible with Ver. 1.0.0. Please match the version of the update data with the person you play with.

We’ve all walked around a zoo and wondered just how hard it could be to run one. After all, you just need to get the animals in one place and keep them from escaping, right? However, if the plethora of zoo management sims on the market is anything to go by, there is a lot more to it. While many of the games in this ever-growing niche offer players the chance to dive into the finer details of zoo ownership, Let’s Build a Zoo keeps things on the more cartoonish, lighthearted side while also providing a decent challenge.
After being released on Steam in 2021, Let’s Build a Zoo has finally gotten a Switch port, giving fans the chance to take their budding attraction on the go. The game is largely the same as the PC version, with the same pixel graphics and increasingly difficult balancing act that all management simulator games always inevitably become. Players start the game with an investor who expects to earn their money back eventually but also gives them plenty of freedom to decide how to do that.

The three big Nintendo Switch eShop releases this week offer something for everyone — but at least two of them will be met with some form of consternation.
Overwatch 2 is technically launching on Switch in the coming week (Thursday-to-Thursday), as it drops on October 4 on all platforms (with cross-progression). Then there's EA Sports FIFA 23 Nintendo Switch Legacy Edition, which doesn't cater to a whole lot of people; given that it's a Switch version of a yearly sports entry.
But then there's Railgrade, a $20 sci-fi train management sim, which is definitely going to cater to a lot of folks. The rest of the week is pretty packed, so enjoy navigating the 100s of digital games that launch every month on Switch.

As for your games and hardware, Google is offering refunds "for all Stadia hardware purchases (Stadia controllers, Founders Edition, Premiere Edition, and Play and Watch with Google TV packages) through the Stadia store," according to an FAQ posted by Google today. It seems like the only aspect of Stadia that won't be refunded are Stadia Pro subscriptions. However, you "will be able to continue playing your games in Pro without further charges until the final wind down date." 
If you are hoping to get a refund for your hardware, Google says "most hardware purchases...made directly from Google" will not require you to return your hardware. The company intends to have the majority of refunds processed by Stadia's January 18 shutdown date. 
The Stadia Store and all its functions have been turned off so you will not be able to make any more Stadia-related purchases or in-game transactions. 
Stadia shutting down isn't the most surprising news. Despite cloud gaming's continuing rise in popularity as of late thanks to the likes of Microsoft's Xbox Cloud Gaming initiative and others, Stadia never seemed to really take off. The first big sign that Stadia might not be long for this world came back in February of last year, when Google revealed it was ending its first-party game development and closing two studios. Then, this February, word got out that Google Stadia had reportedly been deprioritized by the company. Now, Stadia has just a few months left in it before it becomes a part of history. So long, Stadia.

Google is shutting down its cloud-based game streaming service Stadia. After a few years of operation, the service is shutting down and refunds are rolling out.
In a new blog post, Google VP and Stadia general manager Phil Harrison says the technology "hasn't gained the traction with users" it expected. So the company has decided to wind down its Stadia services.
Google will be refunding all Stadia hardware purchases made through the Google Store. All game and add-on content purchases made through the Stadia store will also be refunded.
Those who want to can keep playing their Stadia games through January 18, 2023. So if you've got a save file you want to clear, you'd better get on that. Google expects to have the "majority" of refunds completed…]]></summary>

Ubisoft's Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope is out very, very soon — it's nearly October, after all! And in preparation, we've got a brand new trailer that shows off some of the game's gorgeous visuals, but in cutscenes and in gameplay.
Who are "the galaxy's greatest heroes" though? Well, it's Mario, Luigi, Peach, and their Rabbid counterparts, of course! There are a few new Rabbid allies coming along for the ride too, of course, alongside Bowser and — in some DLC — Rayman! It's a big ol' rave amidst the stars.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good Fortune
Fun news for retro block-busting fans this week, as publisher Forever Entertainment has announced a return for the classic puzzle series, Magical Drop. Magical Drop VI, developed by studios Highball Games and Storm Trident, is scheduled to launch later this winter on Nintendo Switch.
Magical Drop, for those less inclined, is a cute 'n' colorful arcade puzzler that first launch in 1995, at the height of the "tile-puzzler" craze. Playing from one of a number of cute avatars, all based upon the Tarot, players must cherry-pick colored orbs from a rapidly descending playfield before firing them back in an effort to match the rainbow-infused patterns together. The goal of Magical Drop is to cause a chain reaction, and thus the player is encouraged to set up several moves ahead of time, that can all be triggered with one final, scalpel-precise move, (hence the series' Japanese title "Chain Reaction").

Developed by Data East and published by SNK, several Magical Drop games were released to arcade and home platform markets throughout the mid-'90s. The series' most recent release, Magical Drop V, launched on Steam in 2012 and was an enormous disappointment, riddled with bugs and issues that often rendered it incompletable. The game was eventually pulled from sale. This new release will no doubt be looking to capture the charm and character of classic entries while delivering engaging gameplay within a variety of single and multiplayer modes.
The visual style depicted here looks a bit "Flash game," but I remain hopeful, as Magical Drop happens to be my personal favorite of all the tile-puzzle franchises. My character of choice? Empress... But then... you knew that already, right? Shock-freakin'-horror.
Magical Drop VI is currently in development for Nintendo Switch.

Update : Pretty much a week to the hour later, Ed Sheeran has dropped the music video for his Pokémon collaboration song 'Celestial'.
What's more interesting, however, is that The Pokémon Company states that the song "will be featured in Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet!" We're thinking it's either an opening theme or the end credits song, but hey, maybe Ed Sheeran is a resident of Paldea? Who knows. We're worried about Eevee in the video though — its face looks a little different.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new thread to pull
Another PlayStation exclusive is making its way to the PC soon. Sackboy: A Big Adventure is getting a PC port on October 27.
Sumo Digital's thread-bound platformer released for PlayStation 4 and PS5 in 2020, as part of the PS5 launch lineup. Now, it's getting the PC treatment, with some new features in tow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAaEqyE_Hfg
The new port of Sackboy will allow for 4K resolution with a target of 120 FPS, if you've got the hardware for it. The platformer will also support a range of display ratios, including wider options like ultrawide, or 21:9.
Sackboy: A Big Adventure will also have NVIDIA DLSS2, or Deep Learning Super Sampling, for those with compatible graphics cards. Variable refresh rate support will also help with all that platforming.
While that's all for higher-end hardware, the PlayStation Blog also highlights lower-end options. It seems like owners with relatively older hardware might still be able to make this game run, albeit at lower settings.
The next big adventure
Sackboy is getting some customization options too. A Big Adventure will fully support the DualSense controller, so you can get those haptics and dynamic trigger effects, same as PlayStation 5.
Mouse and keyboard will also be supported, in both gameplay and the user interface. Achievements are included too, as are cloud saves on both Steam and Epic Games Store.
This seems like a good grab for folks who dig co-op in particular, but maybe don't have the newest hardware. As per our review, Sackboy: A Big Adventure seems like a pretty enjoyable co-op platformer to blast through with a friend or family member.
Sackboy also marks another PlayStation-exclusive game headed to PC. And considering how well these have been going, like with Marvel's Spider-Man and God of War, I'd hope to see more continue making their way over.

Although Nintendo seems to have largely forgotten about it, Super Mario Maker 2 still has its fans. Indeed, so it should; it's a remarkably accessible creative tool for users to turn the Mario levels of their dreams into a reality with an incredibly intuitive UI and toolkit that built on the foundation of the remarkable Wii U original.
As we reported recently, one creator by the name of Metroid Mike 64 has taken the core concept of Super Mario Maker 2 and gone to the very extreme, crafting what is effectively a full Mario campaign complete with 40 courses spread across eight worlds.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you somehow haven't played Skyrim yet, it's out...again
The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Anniversary Edition is out now on Switch, thanks to a sudden eShop drop from Bethesda. Wait, the Switch already had Skyrim?! About that!
As a reminder, nearly five years ago, Skyrim came out on Switch (and subsequently, every device ever). "I knew it!" you're all saying right now. The one that's coming out today on the platform is actually the "Skyrim Anniversary Edition," which has the following features:
"The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim celebrates 10 years of adventuring in stunning detail. The Anniversary Edition includes a decade worth of content: the critically acclaimed core game and add-ons of Skyrim Special Edition, plus pre-existing and new content from Creation Club including quests, dungeons, bosses, weapons, spells, and more."

What does Skyrim Anniversary Edition on Switch actually have?
Those features, to be exact, include:
"The core game, pre-existing and new Creation Club content, plus all three official add-ons: Dawnguard, Hearthfire, and Dragonborn."

Nintendo of Europe points out that in addition to buying this new "complete bundle" for $69.99, you can also upgrade your existing version for $19.99. Of course, it's almost parody at this point: putting some convoluted version of Skyrim out on some other platform randomly without warning.
(Cue the old man voice) Back in my day, we played Skyrim with no mods or DLC! And it was...sort of OK! But eventually small-to-large DLC packs came out for it, some mods rose in popularity (and were integrated into the game by proxy), and then a GOTY edition came, and the rest is history. We're stuck in an endless time loop of Skyrim, with Skyrim Anniversary Edition being the latest version.

Crikey, there's just no stopping Splatoon 3, is there? For a game that caused many to question the validity of its own existence, its success in Japan (and worldwide, mind you!) has proven that the franchise is undoubtedly as popular as ever. Selling 301,845 copies last week, the sequel is swifly closing in on 3 million total sales in Japan, which is frankly just mad considering it's only been out for a few weeks.
Elsewhere, Taiko no Tatsujin: Rhythm Festival makes its debut at number two with 31,085 copies sold. It's certainly a modest number compared to Splatoon 3, but still an impressive start for the new entry, regardless (be sure to check out our review while you're at it!). The Diofield Chronicle also enters the top ten at number eight, having sold a total of 6,415 copies.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[History repeats itself
For the longest time, Sega's Shenmue series was renowned for being an incomplete saga — an epic tale that had no ending. It seems, ironically, that history is set to repeat itself, as it has been suggested that anime adaptation Shenmue: The Animation has been canceled, and will not receive a second season.
The first inkling that the show would not be returning came from the Cartoon Network Schedules Twitter, which noted that the anime had been removed from the Adult Swim VOD archive. This would then be followed by a mournful message from Cartoon Network Senior VP of Animation, Jason DeMarco, who confirmed on the social media site that Ryo Hazuki would not be returning for further adventures.
"Sorry guys. This happened," wrote DeMarco. "And yes, it’s looking like no [season 2] of Shenmue, even though sadly — it did well enough that we were gearing up for [season 2]. Maybe one day…"
https://twitter.com/Clarknova1/status/1574971363453857792?s=20&t=KiMywArbYuExEOnWij9fTQ
It's disappointing to hear that the show was canned despite being, apparently, something of a success. Unfortunately, as TV/movie fans are fast becoming aware, streaming media has become a Wild West Show, with shows, characters, films, and IPs being shot down, binned, or canceled within the blink of an eye, or, more accurately, the swipe of some suit's pen. We see you, Batgirl.
If you want to watch Shenmue: The Animation, then the entire first season is available on anime network Crunchyroll. It's a strange irony to see the Shenmue anime adaptation canceled and rendered incomplete in the same way the video game series was once rendered incomplete. Still, an ending — in a fashion — did eventually rear its head, (even if it took several decades). So keep the engine turning on that forklift truck. Stranger things have happened.
Shenmue: The Animation is available to stream on Crunchyroll.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Motive Studios have detailed some of the ways that their upcoming remake of classic sci-fi survival horror Dead Space will differ, just as new screenshots of the game have cropped up on an early Xbox Store listing. A blog post from the developers shares how they’re reworking the game’s setting of the USG Ishimura, along with bringing protagonist Isaac Clarke into line with Dead Spaces 2 and 3. They’re also finding time to flesh out the story with extra side quests.

After filing a complaint against Nintendo of America and recruitment firm Aston Carter earlier this year which alleged "concerted activities" and "coercive actions", the former contractor who filed that complaint with the NLRB has come forward, revealing their identity and offering further details and an account of their dismissal.
As reported by Axios in an exclusive interview, former playtester Mackenzie Clifton was fired from their contract role at the company in February this year. Nintendo said that they were "terminated for the disclosure of confidential information", according to a statement given to Axios' Stephen Totilo.

I'd literally just woken up and rubbed the sleep out of my eyes, only to emotionally destabilise my morning with an eight-minute-long video in which one of, if not the greatest tennis player of all time poured out his heart. Even his great rival Rafael Nadal couldn't hold back his tears, which said it all, really.
As one's mind does in momentous occasions, it turned to Nintendo Switch Sports football and how its small roster of players may be one of the best representations of talent in a sports game that I've come across. Come on, humour me here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Also, more Destiny 2 stuff
The Amazon Prime Gaming October slate is actually pretty nice, with three big games on the docket: Fallout 76, Shadow of War, and Total War: Warhammer II.
As a reminder, Prime Gaming gave away Shadow of Mordor last month, so you can play the two games back to back. Since it's really easy to mix things up, Shadow of War is the sequel to the original 2014 Shadow of Mordor. Just remember it like...the second conflict escalated into a war. Either way, playing both of these games years later, sans Warner Bros. nonsense, with quality of life patches, is ideal.
Fallout 76 is another perfect "free Prime game," as tons of folks out there are still on the fence about it given the negative reception at launch. At this point though it's clawed its way out of the depths of 1.0, and has a ton of free bug fixes and content patches. It's also really easy to play via multiplayer if you know multiple people with Prime!
And finally, strategy games have a limited appeal to some, and a free hit of Total War: Warhammer II isn't a bad deal at all. With just these three offerings alone, October is one of the better months of the year.
Free Games with Prime (October 2022):
Fallout 76
Middle-earth: Shadow of War
Total War: Warhammer II
Glass Masquerade: Origins
LOOM
Hero’s Hour
Horace
New In-Game Content for Prime Gaming (October 2022):
Destiny 2
Fall Guys
FIFA 22
Grand Theft Auto Online
Madden NFL 23
PUBG: Battlegrounds
Roblox

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This link takes a long time to get started.
Anime fans around the world will be familiar with Sword Art Online. The light novels and the sprawling media empire that they spawned follow the exploits of Kirito as he stumbles from being trapped in one online video game to another. Sword Art Online: Alicization Lycoris is the latest game to follow Kirito’s misadventures and the first to attempt to directly adapt the events of the light novels. The results, unfortunately, are mixed at best.
The story of Sword Art Online has always lent itself toward video game adaptation, allowing characters to reference things like hit points, experience, and levels without breaking the fourth wall. In this iteration, Kirito finds himself in a strange virtual place called Underworld with no memory of how he got there. His quest to contact the outside world is hampered by the fact that none of the other people he meets seem to know they’re in a video game. Most of the inhabitants that Kirito encounters are flat and lifeless, adding to the shallow feeling that we got from the rest of the game.

Cast your minds back to April of this year. Yes, to some it might just seem like yesterday, but we promise, it's been pretty much half a year at this point. Team 17 had announced a pretty sweet looking metroidvania and bullet hell mashup called The Knight Witch, but unfortunately gave no indication as to when we'd be seeing it on the Switch.
Well, thankfully we now have an answer. Team 17 has now confirmed that The Knight Witch - developed by the aptly named 'Super Awesome Hyper Dimensional Mega Team' - will be launching on November 29th. The game is a fast-paced shoot-em-up experience with metroidvania-like exploration and deck building mechanics. You take on the role of Knight Witch Rayne as she faces off against hordes of enemies in a bid to rescue her loved ones.

You see, there's this thing called "convergent evolution", in which two entirely separate species end up evolving into very, very similar-looking (but unrelated!) forms. The most famous and eminently meme-able example of this phenomenon is carcinisation — multiple crustacean species evolving into crab, or crab-adjacent, forms. It is the evolutionary singularity.

The trailer for Sackboy: A Big Adventure has since been taken down, but by then the boy was out of the sack and its existence was noted on Twitter.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The new rewards roll out in October in North America
Sony's new loyalty program is going live next month in North America. PlayStation Stars is rolling out for PlayStation users, starting today and spreading to more regions over the coming weeks.
The Stars launch kicks off in Asia first, where regions there will see the program go live on September 29. North and South America will get PlayStation Stars on October 5, while the program heads to Europe and Australia on October 13.
If you missed the initial announcement, PlayStation Stars is a loyalty program for owners of Sony's console. While it's free and doesn't require PlayStation Plus to enroll, Plus users will get some extra bonuses to their Stars.
By completing campaigns and activities, Stars users can earn rewards. Some might ask you to get a specific trophy, while another might be becoming the first player to platinum a game in their region. One of the first campaigns, dubbed "Hit Play/1994," has members who correctly guess launch games based on song-based clues get a special collectible.

Rewards for Stars
What can you use these rewards for? Well, one type of reward is loyalty points. These can be redeemed in a catalog that may include PSN wallet funds, digital collectibles, or certain PlayStation Store products. Plus members automatically accrue points for purchases on the Store, too.
Those digital collectibles are the other reward, and don't worry. Sony VP Grace Chen told the Washington Post that these are not NFTs. As today's blog post reiterates, these cannot be sold or traded. They might be rare, but they aren't one-of-a-kind and they don't use any blockchain technology. These little collectibles will be visible on a display case within the PlayStation app, which can be viewed by other users.
You can get more info and make sure you're signed up when it goes live over at the PlayStation Stars page.

Getting to play a game's beta before its release is definitely exciting, but it's not without its downsides — because said game isn't out yet, it can come with a whole slew of bugs that still need working out, which can range from minor inconveniences to game-breaking issues. While the Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II beta was a blast to play, of course, a few problems have stood out to players more than others. Specifically, players complained about imbalanced footsteps audio, as well as issues with enemy visibility.
No need to fret, though, because Infinity Ward has announced that they're already on the case to fix these bugs, and more, before Modern Warfare II's full launch. "While sentiment around footstep audio was more positive i…]]></summary>

Horror is a fun little genre. It’s like drama, but it tries to open up your bowels. And we, as humans, are afraid of so many things. Some things we’ve come up with on our own terrify us. Sometimes we’ve decided that things intended to cause joy instead cause fear. It’s great! You don’t even need something tangible, life itself is one long horrifying experience!
The Fridge is Red is a bit of a departure from the usual grotesque slasher horror I’ve been indulging in lately. It’s psychological beyond just, “look out, that cat has got a knife!” It’s downright surreal, nailing what dreams would probably be like if I could dream about something aside from noodles.

Bandai Namco is the latest developer/publisher to announce the formation of its own in-house music label. Emanating out of its European offices, the amusingly titled "Bandai Namco Game Music Label" will publish soundtracks of the studio's games in a physical and digital capacity.
"Since the first video games and all throughout the history of the industry, music has always been a core component of the gaming experience," said the studio in a press statement. "Music made the games’ memories last longer and followed the players into their daily lives with amazing soundtracks to go back to and relive the stories they played."
"We strive to delight our fans with more than just games, so we decided to bring video game music to as many listeners as possible, with the release of two digital albums of game background music."
The first two releases from the label are the soundtrack to the smash-selling RPG Elden Ring, which launched digitally earlier this month, and Motoi Sakuraba's soundtrack to anime adventure title Tales of Arise, which launches today. Both records can be purchased via several music streaming platforms, including Spotify, Apple Music, Amazon Music, Deezer, and the iTunes Store, among others. The Bandai Namco Game Music Label intends to build upon this catalog of memorable and evocative scores.
Most recently, French publisher Microids also announced the formation of its own record label. You can read all about it in our previous article right here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Voodoo you think you are?
You may have heard of a little game releasing on Switch this month – a point-and-click graphic adventure featuring Voodoo mysticism, set in the Caribbean and with music by Peter McConnell, composer on Monkey Island 2? That’s right! It’s Voodoo Detective, the magical, mystical debut from Short Sleeve Studio, hot on the heels of fan-craze juggernaut Return to Monkey Island. Timing-wise, this Switch release is like arriving at a fancy dress party with a rubber glove on your head and yoghurt pot on your nose, only to meet Mel Gibson wearing the rooster suit from Chicken Run.
However, having taken advantage of that particular monkey in the room for an intro paragraph, we can confess that Voodoo Detective is very much its own thing – not simply the comedy Caribbean voodoo graphic adventure a grandparent bought you by mistake. The setting is Zo Wanga Isle, an island increasingly overrun by tourists thanks to the growing commercial operations of a corrupt corporation, Island Ventures. Native Zowangians like Voodoo Detective (that’s his name – competing for silliness with his brother Donut Hole Billy) are squeezed by real estate development and profit-digging commerce, cashing in on the local climate and culture.

Gameloft has given Disney Dreamlight Valley players a heads-up as to what updates to expect in the game over the coming weeks — yes, it really is October very soon (less than a week, even!). And perhaps the biggest thing to note is that the iconic villain from The Lion King, Scar, is coming to the game "in around 3 weeks".
Previously announced for Fall 2022, it looks like Scar will be hitting that window comfortably. Though the developer can't promise the exact date of Scar's arrival in the game, he will be coming alongside a slew of bug fixes for the game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Skull and Bones has been delayed again, this time to March of next year. 
It was originally due out in 2018 but then delayed to 2019. It was delayed to at least March 2020 after that, but things went quiet and the game missed that window. Then, in May of last year, Ubisoft announced that Skull and Bones would release sometime between April 1, 2022, and March 31, 2023. And now, it's slipping out of its November 8 release date, which was only just announced back in July, into a new March 9, 2023 date. As for why, the team cites a need for more polish and balancing.
Kotaku's Ethan Gach says sources say the teams working on Skull and Bones are burnt out. According to Gach in his Kotaku story, the latest technical test for the game ended on September 19. One source involved with the test told Kotaku that gameplay was more refined than in previous tests but that progression needed work as it still felt too shallow. Gach writes that this is a concern shared by multiple sources close to the game's development. 
Here's what Ubisoft has to say about the delay: 
The last the public saw of Skull and Bones in a big way was during a July showcase, which is where we saw extensive gameplay and received the now-delayed November 8 release date. I learned a lot more about the game around the same time when Skull and Bones was Game Informer's cover story. At the time, the team seemed confident in its November release date but given the history of this title, I'm not surprised it's been delayed again.

Endless nightmares, hand-drawn weirdness, and twin-stick shmup action sound like a pretty bizarre list of ingredients for a video game concept, but that hasn't stopped Japanese indie studio Neotro from mixing 'em up and creating the fascinating new release, NeverAwake, which launches today on PC.
NeverAwake is a twin-stick shmup set within a terrifying, never-ending sleep. A young girl, Rem, is plagued by a litany of daily troubles, all of which have suddenly chosen to manifest themselves into her dreams as unholy nightmares. Now trapped within a dungeon of her own plights and worries, Rem is forced to face each and every one of her fears, conjuring up an array of firepower and other abilities to take down the nasties.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-HMu7sdhas
Be it violent neighborhood dogs, the mean girls from high school, trips to the surgeon, or even those horrid vegetables she has to eat at mealtimes, Rem must steel herself against her own brain spiders, conquering these demons once and for all if she is ever to escape this literal nightmare and return to the waking world. NeverAwake boasts around 80 looped levels of action, complete with an array of grotesque bosses, hand-drawn visuals, an arsenal of dynamic weaponry, and even multiple endings, all painted against relentless, blood-pumping shmup action.
NeverAwake is available now on PC via Steam. You can also purchase the new title bundled with a digital artbook and the game's soundtrack. For console fans, PlayStation and Nintendo Switch ports of NeverAwake will launch in January 2023, with physical editions to follow on both platforms.

Ubisoft's multiplayer piracy game Skull and Bones is getting another delay. Today, the publisher confirms that it's charting a course for Skull and Bones to launch on March 9, 2023.
The team attributes work being done polishing and balancing the experience ahead of its release. "To give you the best possible experience we've decided to take a little more time to make sure we can deliver exactly that," the statement reads.
Kotaku, which broke the news just ahead of its official confirmation, reports that a recent Skull and Bones technical test ended on September 19. A source who was involved in the test told Kotaku that while the gameplay was "more refined" than previous ones, overall player progression still seemed "shallow."
Ubisoft confirms it plans to host an open beta of Skull and Bones in the near future. No date's been set for that yet.

A pirate's life for me
Skull and Bones had finally locked in a firm date for this year, set for November 8. The piracy sim has spent years in development, experiencing several delays and pushbacks along the way. Its studio, Ubisoft Singapore, was also the subject of reports about its internal culture, alongside broader issues reported at Ubisoft.
While it's been floating around in the water for a while, the November release seemed optimistic. Skull and Bones was one of the games featured at the recent Ubisoft Forward. With a good chunk of gameplay and showcase spotlight, Skull and Bones seemed set to sail.
Ubisoft also rolled out a bunch of its plans for Assassin's Creed and more at that showcase. As for this year though, there is still Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope. And yes, the Rabbids talk in this new one.
Skull and Bones is still planned as a current-gen console game, arriving on PC, Stadia, Luna, Xbox Series X|S, and PS5 on March 9, 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wiglett wobbles but it won't fall down
A new Pokemon has been revealed for upcoming Switch entries Pokemon Scarlet and Violet, and it's a tall, wiggly one. Wiglett is a new Pokemon for the Paldea region.
Teased today in a new video on the World Pokemon Ecological Society site, Wiglett joins the Paldean lineup. You can sit through the lecture online, which also shows some other regional Pokemon like Paldean Wooper, or just check out the video below via Serebii.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQoVAMGli0E
Now, astute viewers may note that Wiglett shares some similarities with longtime Generation 1 mainstay Diglett. The burrowing Pokemon has a recognizable look, and Wiglett does indeed look a lot like Diglett. The video calls attention to this fact, too.
As it goes on to stress though, this Pokemon is clearly different. It's longer, for one. And it lives near water, in the sand.
"The form and movements indeed look like Diglett, but they are probably different Pokemon," the video states. So there you go.
A new region to explore
We've seen a bunch of the new monsters in store for this new mainline Pokemon entry. There's the neon monkey Grafaiai, the absolute perfection of Lechonk, and the two new box art Legendary Pokemon. Those two even act as your rideable mounts for the new game, helping you travel across the land of Paldea.
The extra travel will help, as there's a lot to do in Scarlet and Violet. There are essentially three main storylines, with one following the usual Gym battles and others dealing with different situations in the region.
As for Wiglett, it's an interesting design, if a little unsettling. It looks like Diglett was rolled out like dough. Still, the little mole Pokemon was a fun one to have around in the original generation, and these goofy monsters seem fun too.
Pokemon Scarlet and Violet launches for Nintendo Switch on November 18, 2022.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Turns out early access isn’t just for games. The Amazon Prime Early Access Sale is taking place this October 11th-12th, a full six weeks before Black Friday 2022, and from a PC gaming standpoint will offer the same kinds of component and peripheral deals as that annual pre-Christmas shoppingfest. Just earlier.
That said, the Prime Early Access Sale isn’t purely a prelude to the anything-goes chaos of Black Friday. It’s more like a Prime Day 2, in that it’s an Amazon-only event, with all the best deals set to be require Amazon Prime membership to access. That’s right, it’s one of those.

Another Splatoon 3 patch is scheduled to be released on September 30, thanks to heads-up on Nintendo of Japan's support site.
The core focus of this patch is to address communication errors (disconnects), which reared up quite a bit after launch, into the most recent Splatfest. Three fixes address specific weapon/button combination bugs, amid other issues (like game crashes when using the locker system in a specific manner). Thankfully, this patch will retroactively fix several problems, including a catalog (a seasonal reward track) bug.
As a reminder, Nintendo plans on updating Splatfest matches more in the future. Keep in mind that the below patch notes are roughly translated, but they get the point across. Once the patch is actually out, typically in the early m…]]></summary>

Two titles from Supermassive Games' The Dark Pictures anthology have received current-gen upgrades on PlayStation and Xbox — As noted by VGC, the upgrades appear to be free to all players who currently own the requisite PS4/Xbox One editions of 2019's Man of Medan and/or its 2020 follow-up, Little Hope.
The new PS5 and Xbox Series X editions of the creepy horror releases will feature improved visuals and reduced load times. In addition, a new update released for all versions of the games includes a litany of tweaks and features. These include an improved U.I.; new difficulty and QTE settings; improved walking speeds for certain sequences and characters; updated event triggers; and some new accessibility options, which include more sizing choices for the games' subtitles.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SD60VTe7VC8
Man of Medan also receives a revised chapter, "Flooded", which introduces new gameplay elements and a selection of possible new deaths for the seafaring adventure's climax. The third title in the horror anthology, House of Ashes, is already available on PS5 and Xbox Series X, and is thus unlikely to receive a similar tech upgrade. As for the future of the franchise, several titles were trademarked by Supermassive earlier in the year, including O Death, The Craven Man, Directive 8020, Intercession, and finally Winterfold.
I really want to play them all, truly. But I am, unfortunately, a massive scaredy cat.
The Dark Pictures Anthology is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

More specifically, this EA Originals title will be released on February 17, 2023. This news comes by way of the game's reveal trailer released today. In it, we see a lot of monster hunting action. The game seems to take place in a mythological land filled with large and dangerous beasts. You'll need to craft better gear to take on tougher monsters, eventually taming the otherwise wild area. 
Check out the reveal trailer below: 


As you can see, Wild Hearts looks great, especially if you're someone who's a fan of Capcom's long-running Monster Hunter series.

Twitter user Laisul shared a recording of what they claimed are lines from an unreleased Joker pack, and they do sound like Hamill’s classic rendition of the Batman villain. Why so serious? Well, announcer packs replace the default MultiVersus announcer with the voice of one of the game’s fighters, so Joker’s addition to the roster seems legit.

Described as "the land of the beast," the game's world (Azuma) seems to be fairly varied, with several different biomes.

We've included the original 2011 release of one of these games in this month's Time Capsule, but there's another notable exception we've decided to save for further down the line.

I'm genuinely not thinking of any specific game, but many 'retro' inspired games fall into this way of thinking, and many more fans cut a good one down because of it.
Itorah, however, feels pure in the sense of capturing the essence, the heart of a good retro platformer, not just going through the motions to technically qualify for an arbitrary category. Aeons ago, it would have ported comfortably to your GameBoys and gramophones, and probably look just as pretty and feel just as good in motion, judging by the talented art direction on show here.

SNK has announced the release date for the next team of DLC fighters headed toward its fab scrapper The King of Fighters XV — Team Samurai, consisting of Samurai Shodown stars Haohmaru, Nakoruru, and Darli Dagger, will be available to download on PC and console platforms from October 4.
The new faction is, obviously, something of a crossover affair, and will see the SamSho posse step up to the plate against KoF's finest. I'm not 100% sure how Queensbury Rules Darli's enormous saw-sword is in a fistfight, but given that the KoF krew have literal superpowers, we can probably let it slide. While Haohmaru and Nakoruru are series veterans, this is only Darli's second gaming appearance, having made her debut in the ace 2019 Samurai Shodown release.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxTHBgpCMfo
Team Samurai will represent the fourth batch of DLC characters to join KoF XV's enormous roster since the title's initial launch earlier this year. The next season, which will kick off in 2023, has already promised to bring about the return of some KoF veterans. These include Kyo Kusanagi's well-meaning protege Shingo Yabuki, and the honorable taekwondo expert and criminal reformer Kim Kaphwan. Given Street Fighter 6's imminent launch and its wickedly redesigned Juri, it looks like it is going to be a fine year for windy, billowing taekwondo pants.
The King of Fighters XV is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox Series X platforms — Additionally, Samurai Shodown 2019 will receive a rollback netcode update next spring, which will hopefully bring about a resurgence of interest in the solid, if misunderstood, fighting title.

The new FTUE addresses that feedback directly. In phase one, players will need to unlock the game's modes and chat functions – this happens "rapidly," Blizzard writes in the blog post.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s usually nice to see older games get updates, particularly when we’re not expecting it. Think of it as a good jump scare. Supermassive Games have given their first two The Dark Pictures Anthology some extra care and attention today, dropping in new difficulty settings and accessibility options, tweaked UI, and even faster walking for characters. There’s also an extended chapter for Man Of Medan. I didn’t think update trailers were a thing but there’s one for this, which you can watch below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are Pokémon designs like Charizard that make me go, "ooo yes, very nice" and there are others like Voltorb that make me go, "oh, why do you exist?" There's also a rare third class of Pokémon I call "weird lil things" when I see them and Wiglett, a new Pokémon joining the Pokédex in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, is that class' newest member. 
Today, Nintendo and The Pokémon Company released a 3 and a half minute video highlighting Wiglett, its similarities to Diglett, and how it's just different enough that it is an entirely new species, rather than a regional variant. As such, this new Diglett-like Pokémon is called Wiglett. It looks like a worm, lives in the sea and on the beach, and seems to stick together with other Wigletts. Check it out in Serebii's video below: 


I'm most excited to see Wiglett's evolution, if it evolves at all. But hopefully, I'll see that in another trainer's party because I'm not sure Wiglett is a sure bet for mine. 
For more about Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, watch the latest trailer that shows off new school rivalries, gym leaders, and more, and then watch this trailer all about competitive play in the 9th generation of Pokémon. After that, read our preview of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet to find out everything you need to know about the Paldea region. 
Is Wiglett going to be in your party? Let us know what you think of it in the comments below!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Seems it’s that time of year again: the annual Intel CPU refresh is upon us, with CEO Pat Gelsinger announcing the 13th Gen "Raptor Lake" processor family onstage at Intel Innovation 2022 last night. These chips will stick to the hybrid Performance core/Efficiency core design introduced by the 12th Gen Alder Lake range – probably wisely, given that includes some of the best gaming CPUs ever – but ups the E-core counts, L2 cache capacities and clock speeds. Raptor Lake will go on sale on October 20th, a few weeks after the just-launched AMD Ryzen 7000 series.
The showcase also included a few key details on the Intel Arc A770 Limited Edition, the top-ranking graphics card in the long-delayed Arc Alchemist lineup of gaming GPUs. This will also launch next month, on October 12th, and cost $329. Honestly, part of me was wondering if we’ll ever see the day, but yes: there really will be an Intel graphics card on the market. Even if it is more of an RTX 3060 rival than a cheap RTX 4080 alternative.

        <updated>2022-09-28T10:00:22.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Smile.
Yesterday saw Player First Games' brawler MultiVersus receive a brand new update, bringing with it bug fixes, balance changes, the arrival of new fighter Rick Sanchez and, of course, a fresh new batch of character rumors, brought about by those crafty, crafty PC dataminers.
Much like with the previous update, tinkerers have been playing around with the source code of Version 1.03 of MultiVersus and have found secrets buried within. These secrets come in the form of a new "Announcers Pack," that contains narration recorded by DC Comics' Clown Prince of Crime himself, Joker. This would, obviously, suggest that Gotham City's deadliest is getting set to join the MV roster somewhere down the line — This is an inevitability that will surely come as no surprise to anybody.
You can check out the unearthed dialogue in the tweet below, posted online by @LaisulMV.
https://twitter.com/LaisulMV/status/1574811514489405440?s=20&t=ZGFG1IqOumrxd_N_YojfQA
While this is unconfirmed at this time, the dialogue appears to have been recorded by Mark Hamill, who famously played Joker in the award-winning Batman: The Animated Series, and is considered one of the very best portrayals of the psychopathic criminal in the canon. Splashing out on authentic voices and top-tier characters is partly responsible for MultiVersus success, giving the platform fighter a distinction above some of the other Smash Bros. clones on the market.
Previously, dataminers had uncovered voice lines for two more unannounced stars, The Wizard of OZ's Wicked Witch of the West, and The Ghost with The Most: Beetlejuice. To date, neither of these roster additions have been referenced in any official capacity, so these characters may be waiting in the wings for further seasons. At least sweetie-pie Harley will finally be getting a measure of revenge on ol' Mr. J.
MultiVersus is currently in free-to-play open beta on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's tough making a story where you establish early on that your main character will still be alive at the end. In The Excavation Of Hob's Barrow, a point and click, small town, folk horror adventure game, the events are narrated by the main character Thomasina, writing in the future, and the game walks a slightly different line. Rather than successfully making you believe a character you know survives is in peril, all the way through The Excavation Of Hob's Barrow you are aware that Thomasina in the future is alive but, somehow, definitely not okay. And you believe you can save her anyway.
This looming dread, growing increasingly loom as the game goes on, is one of the most effective weapons in Hob's Barrows' arsenal of horror. Thomasina, a barrow-digger and proto-feminist trouser-wearer in a time when trousers were worn by men, is a practical and mostly cheerful woman. She approaches all the puzzles she has to solve in the robust, roll-your-sleeves up manner of an old-timey governess who doesn't care if you hate learning French verbs. The Thomasina of the future voiceover, however, sounds blank, drained and sad. It's a contrast that weighs more and more heavy as you slice into the horrible heart of Hob's Barrow, and it underscores how great it is to play the game in its fully voiced form.
As well as the voice acting, Hob's Barrow has an appropriately creepsome soundtrack, making fabulous use of the juddering bass tones that put all humans and related monkeys automatically on edge, and isn't a stranger to unsettling lighting. Evil in this game is a sick purple. Most of all, some praise should be especially given to the several horrible close-ups that pop up: Thomasina's eyes, wide in shock, a malevolent cat as he crawls onto your bed; round eyes over a slack, downturned mouth with little peg teeth in it. Devs Cloak And Dagger Games can coax extraordinary depth and motion from their pixel-art and then use that to repulse you.

Welcome back! It is a new Tuesday, which means tonight there will be a new episode of Spot Dodge: A Live Nintendo Podcast exclusively on Destructoid. Topics: Today on Spot Dodge the crew discusses Nintendo’s downright unmatched game release cadence as a publisher.
Nintendo is one of the very few publishers that seem to work way ahead of schedule — the company has been known to “sit on” fully completed games until it can find an open slot to put them in its release schedule. Not only is that almost unheard of in today’s gaming economy, but most publishers are quick to release games before they’re done cooking. We’ve seen it time and time again — Battlefield 2042, Halo Infinite, No Man’s Sky, Cyberp…]]></summary>

        <updated>2022-09-27T22:00:50.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It was only a matter of time
In my opinion, Trombone Champ is one of the best things to happen to gaming all year. It's easy for anyone to pick up, it's well-designed, and it's laugh-out-loud goofy. I was skeptical when I heard someone say it's a Game of the Year contender, but it only took a few minutes into playing it to make me a believer. Now that the game's popularity has launched into the stratosphere, thanks to word of mouth on social media, we're starting to see the mods slowly roll in, which is exciting for someone who is very much a fan of mods.
Mods don't just include putting Trombone Champ in VR or adding custom song maps, however — it also means that players who modify their game to take custom controller inputs are back on the scene. In this case, it's my man Rudeism, a streamer known for his modified controller setups. At this point, I'm basically his full-fledged fan. This time, he hooked up a real trombone to play its virtual counterpart in the game.
https://twitter.com/rudeism/status/1574760613683023879?s=20&t=rEXbyltnL1uM9nxDgm62pA
According to his Twitter post, an "ultrasonic sensor controls the slide, and a microphone controls the dooting." I have no idea what any of that means, but he clearly got it working in Trombone Champ, so good on him. Rudeism also states in his post that he wishes he could play the trombone IRL, which has me wondering: did he full-on buy a trombone for this bit? Those things aren't exactly cheap, so that level of commitment is admirable, to say the least. Who knows, maybe this will be the beginning of an illustrious career for him as a concert trombonist.
Either way, this real trombone Trombone Champ setup did exactly what it was supposed to — make me happy — and isn't that all we can ask for from our internet content these days? Now if anyone needs me, I'll be trying to top my high scores until someone mods K-pop songs into the game.

But alas, both time and its ferociously difficult combat have got the better of me, so you'll have to settle for some impressions instead. This isn’t simply a case of drinking the 'git gud' kool-aid either. While I'll hold my hands up now and say that Soulslikes have always been a bit of a challenge for me, I feel like I've been making some pretty good in-roads into the genre lately, and after falling in love with Moonscars' reveal trailer earlier in the year during the Humble Games Showcase, I really, really, really wanted to like this one. Sadly, it's become increasingly clear that Moonscars does not like me very much, and maybe even hates my guts a bit - which is ironic, considering how many organs I've chucked at its feet over the last week and a bit to appease its hungry dread moon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There’s nothing inherently wrong with the AMD Radeon RX 6650 XT's concept – faster clock speeds than the RX 6600 XT, to better compete with Nvidia’s RTX cards? Yeah why not – but surely its timing is questionable. Any GPU launching several months into 2022 would only ever do so under the looming shadows of Nvidia’s GeForce RTX 40 series and the AMD Radeon RX 7000 series, the latter being officially revealed in just a few days’ time. Not to mention Intel Arc Alchemist, delayed as it has been.


Still. AMD’s next-gen, RDNA 3-based GPUs are an unknown quantity, and the RTX 40 series will at first focus on high-end models like the RTX 4090. Even if its RDNA 2 architecture is on the way out, could the RX 6650 XT not find room in the pack as one of the best graphics cards for 1080p and 1440p?

Now imagine that surface is constantly under threat from waves of alien attacks and that's pretty much Dome Keeper in a nutshell, a moreish, meditative mining game that sees you balance digging for resources and hunting for all-important relics while defending your eponymous dome from being smashed to smithereens.

Alongside those, the RPS gang were exploring the show floor and here you’ll find highlights of what we saw, who we chatted to, what we played, and just general show shenanigans. Enjoy!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A while back, I was wondering where all the Steam Deck accessories were. Valve themselves have the case covered, including a decent hard case with even the cheapest 64GB models, and it’s not difficult to pick up one of the best microSD cards for the Steam Deck. Otherwise, and especially with delays to Valve’s official dock, there’s not much out there from the usual PC hardware suppliers.
I therefore turned to the makers and sellers of Etsy, where a kind of indie Steam Deck accessory market has emerged. Soon, I’d bought (with my own money, you’re welcome ReedPop) a selection of unique, handcrafted, sometimes questionable gadgets and appendages, and promptly packed them onto a train for independent appraisal by a newly minted Steam Deck owner. Specifically, RPS vid bud Liam.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At long last, HBO has released the first trailer for The Last of Us. Though officially classified as a “teaser,” it offers nearly two minutes of clips that provide pretty good looks at the upcoming adaptation. 
The teaser doesn’t reveal a premiere date, but we get to see how Joel (Pedro Pascal) and Ellie (Bella Ramsey) survive the post-apocalyptic world, scenes of humanity's collapse a la the game's prologue, and a quick glimpse of a Clicker. 


The Last of Us is led by Craig Mazin of Chernobyl fame and Naughty Dog co-president Neil Druckmann. We learned during Summer Game Fest that Troy Baker and Ashley Johnson, who portray Joel and Ellie in the games, will have unspecified roles in the series. The Last of Us will be available to stream exclusively on HBO Max in 2023.
To help prepare fans for what's to come, Naughty Dog recently released a remake of the first game dubbed The Last of Us Part 1. You can read editor Blake Hester's impressions of that title here.]]></summary>

Various mods let V dress up as characters from Edgerunners and wield their weapons, as well as adding music, adverts, and more to the game world. Players old and new have flocked to the dystopian RPG since Edgerunners debuted on Netflix earlier this month, and I imagine more than a few might want to cosplay as their Best Girl (a controversial topic which I dare not broach).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In March, the Entertainment Software Association (ESA) announced that E3 would return next year as an in-person show following the cancellation of the 2022 edition. We now know the dates of the event as well as how it will be structured.
E3 2023 takes place at the Los Angeles Convention Center from Tuesday, June 13 through Friday, June 16. Digital presentations, such as the annual press conferences held by first and third-party publishers, take place a couple of days before, beginning June 11. 
The ESA also states that the show will feature separate admission days for industry professionals and the general public. E3 Business Days, designated for developers, publishers, and press/media, take place on June 13-15. Media registration opens in December. 
June 15-16 will host E3 Gamer Days, where fans will be admitted to the show floor. There is no date for public registration at this time. Since E3 first opened its doors to fans in 2017, professionals and the public have largely intermingled for the entirety of the show, which has caused issues in terms of crowd traffic. E3 adopting the same dividing format as events such as Tokyo Game Show should alleviate that problem.   
As previously announced, PAX/New York Comic-Con organizer ReedPop will helm E3 2023. The company has promised to make E3 into a "world class event to serve the global gaming industry." The last E3 to take place in-person at the LA Convention Center was in 2019. The 2020 show was canceled due to the pandemic, and the 2021 version was a digital-only show.]]></summary>

New organisers ReedPop are the people behind PAX, EGX, New York Comic-Con, and Star Wars Celebration, to name a few. I should mention too, of course, that they're this site’s parent organisation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Silent Hill: The Short Message has been rated by South Korea's Game Rating committee, and it's possible this is a new unannounced Silent Hill game. 
This news comes by way of Video Games Chronicle, which reported that the rating committee rated Silent Hill: The Short Message today. However, the rating did not include any platforms, so it's unclear where this game might land if it actually ends up being a real title. In fact, the rating features little else other than listing Uniana as its publisher. As VGC notes, this company regularly publishes Konami games in South Korea. 
The publication also notes that Silent Hill: The Short Message might be related to one of various Silent Hill projects reportedly in the works at multiple different studios. VGC reported in February that Konami is planning a revival of the Silent Hill series amidst other reports stating that a Silent Hill 2 remake is in development. 
While waiting to hopefully learn more about Silent Hill: The Short Message, read about Silent Hill creator Keiichiro Toyama's new game, Slitterhead.

In 2022, there's a special focus on the impact of online piracy on US workers. This will likely lead to detailed reports on hundreds of thousands of estimated job losses.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Everyone's talking about Trombone Champ. Not since Untitled Goose Game have I heard this much excited chat about a game from pals who don't usually talk about games. This is because: 1) it's a fun silly idea; 2) it's very funny to miss a trombone note and squeal out a farty toot in the middle of Also Sprach Zarathustra. As I play Trombone Champ myself, I come to really appreciate that. It's a rare rhythm game where playing badly doesn't frustrate or berate me, because the worst-case scenario is making fart noises, and fart noises are funny.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Standing here, I realize that this Super Replay will be a cut above the rest because we’ll be slicing and dicing in Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance! Join us today on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central to enjoy two hours of what will be a full playthrough of the cult favorite action game streaming weekly each Friday. 
Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance serves as a sequel/spin-off to Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots that puts cyborg ninja Raiden at the helm. Instead of sneaking around in boxes, players eviscerate foes in fast-paced, stylish action courtesy of developer Platinum Games. Since its launch in 2013, Revengence’s action and absurdity have garnered it a passionate internet fandom, but I have a little secret: I didn’t think the game was all that special when I played it at launch. However, years of being inundated with internet memes and being told my opinion is incorrect has inspired me to give Revengece another look. Will I acquire a new appreciation for the game nine years later? How many watermelons will I slice? You’ll have to tune in to find out. 
Watch on Twitch!
Join me, Marcus Stewart, along with Blake Hester as we revisit Raiden’s beloved solo adventure. If you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes. You’ll also be granted entry to the official Game Informer Discord channel, where our welcoming community members, moderators, and staff gather to talk games, entertainment, food, and organize hangouts!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Illumination’s Super Mario Bros. film will get its first teaser trailer next month. It also has a new premiere date for the movie following its delay in April. 
The animated film, starring Chris Pratt as the titular plumber, will hit theaters on April 7, 2023. The biggest question regarding the film has been what Pratt’s Mario performance will sound like, and we may finally get to hear it in just a few weeks. The movie’s first teaser trailer premieres on October 6 at 4 p.m. ET during the New York Comic Con.

The Super Mario Bros. cast includes Charlie Day as Luigi, Anya Taylor-Joy as Peach, Jack Black as Bowser, Keegan-Michael Key as Toad, and Seth Rogan as Donkey Kong. The film was delayed to ensure quality, though Nintendo was reportedly pleased last year with how the film was shaping up at that point. Pratt recently described his performance as “unlike anything you’ve heard in the Mario world,” and it apparently won't have an Italian accent.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The RPS-beloved turn-based strategy game Solium Infernum is back from the dead. Announced earlier today on stage at EGX London 2022, Armello creators League Of Geeks will be resurrecting and reimagining the game in 2023. Originally released in 2009 by solo dev Vic Davis and his studio Cryptic Comet, Solium Infernum cast you as an Archfiend hoping to stake a claim for Satan's empty throne. With a strong emphasis on political intrigue and Machiavellian backstabbing over taking things by force, this strategy game from hell was a firm RPS favourite back in the day, spawning an eight-part diary series of the team's play-by-email multiplayer adventures. Alas, it never quite found the audience it deserved back in the early 2010s, eventually causing Davis to shut up shop completely in 2015 and pursue a career in tabletop.
League Of Geeks are here to change that, though, and after speaking with studio director and co-founder Trent Kusters (both at EGX earlier today and during a hands-off presentation of their pre-alpha demo late last week), it's clear the team have taken great care in bringing Solium Infernum up to date for modern audiences. It leans into all the same kinds of mind games as Cryptic Comet's original, and its simultaneous turn structure is still very much intact – just with lusher 3D visuals, and all-new, revamped menu screens. And it looks devilishly good.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Playing Wayward Strand feels like navigating a detailed clockwork mechanism. It reminds me of those cuckoo clocks where on the hour every hour a tiny door opens revealing two mechanical dolls that come together and have a 'lil smooch. That’s essentially how Wayward Strand works but on a bigger scale. Characters are set on strict routines, following predetermined paths and schedules that are often invisible to you. They welcome an interruption - a friendly natter or helpful hand - but whether you’re there or not, they’ll go about their business regardless. The world keeps on spinning and all that.
It’s an interesting way of capturing the passage of time, and in Wayward Strand how you choose to spend that time is pretty important in a game that makes a point of not waiting for you.

All three are coming soon with varying degrees of price bumps over the RTX 3090 and RTX 3080, though Nvidia reckon the performance and feature improvements of the 40 series’ Ada Lovelace architecture will make them worthy investments. Especially with the aid of DLSS 3, a new and significantly upgraded version of Nvidia’s DLSS upscaler that will only work with RTX 40 series GPUs at launch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Have you ever played a game and thought, "Are we actually the bad guys here?" Usually, the whole "we're fighting on the wrong side of history" line is a deliberate plot device in RPGs, offering moments of clarity to not only peel back the curtain and provide fresh impetus for the events yet to come, but also to cleverly reframe everything you've achieved so far. I don't say this to spoil the events of The DioField Chronicle, the new real-time strategy game from Lancarse and Square Enix, but it is a question I found myself asking a lot during its middle act - and it never quite delivers the punchline you're looking for. 
Around 8-10 hours into the game, there's an extended portion of the campaign that sees your band of Blue Fox mercenaries bringing an entire region of DioField Island to heel because they're, err, pro democracy. Of the cast's central quartet, only one stands up as a voice of reason when motions are made to quell these despicable riots, but he's repeatedly shot down every time he tries to offer an alternate view. Eventually, one character says to him, and I quote, "Isca, what has got into you? You ought to know the danger posed by the ideology of democracy." It's an odd stance for someone clearly not a villain to take in 2022, although really, I should have probably seen it coming. Our mercs work for a duke after all, and most are aristocratic nobles who are handy with a sword. Oh no. I think this might actually be played: Tories - The Game. Yuck.

        <updated>2022-09-21T17:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Apple TV show Ted Lasso has proven to be one of the most popular and well-liked series of the last few years, introducing viewers to a lovable cast of characters whose lives and storylines largely revolve around the fictional English Premier League football club, AFC Richmond. Through its first two seasons, the series has taken home numerous awards, including the Primetime Emmy for Outstanding Comedy Series in 2021 and 2022, with several of its actors – including Jason Sudeikis, Brett Goldstein, and Hannah Waddingham – taking home awards for original performances. Now, Ted Lasso reaches into a new realm: video games. 
EA Sports today announced that Ted Lasso and AFC Richmond are joining the FIFA 23 roster of teams. Lasso is joined on the sidelines by Coach Beard, with the pitch being populated by some of the team's biggest stars like Jamie Tartt, Roy Kent, Dani Rojas, Sam Obisanya, and Isaac McAdoo. While the actors' likenesses are included in the product, EA Sports hasn't indicated if we'll be hearing Jamie Tartt and Roy Kent's signature crowd chants (though it seems doubtful, seeing as how Roy Kent's chant would probably bump the ESRB rating up to M for Mature).
Regardless of that fact, you can play matches at AFC Richmond's home ground, Nelson Road, and even take control of Coach Lasso or AFC Richmond through Career Mode. AFC Richmond is also playable in Kick-Off, Online Friendlies, and Online Seasons. FIFA 23 Ultimate Team is also adding several AFC Richmond customization items, including kits, TIFOs, and the option to select Ted Lasso or Coach Beard as your FUT club's manager. All the AFC Richmond content in FUT will be obtainable through objectives and challenges.
You can see Ted Lasso and the AFC Richmond squad in action through the trailer below.


FIFA 23 arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4. Xbox One, PC, and Stadia on September 30.]]></summary>

As someone definitely not attempting to rig the vote, I respect people on both sides yet am pleased by this outcome. This week, ah sure, why not have another crack at pitting two similar-ish things against each other. It feels against the spirit of the competition but I'm curious. Let's try two sounds. What's better: ding! or the Howie scream?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a sucker for invention when it comes to story in video games, and Beacon Pines drew me in with what looked like a choice-driven adventure. As you explore the down-on-its-luck farming town of the title, you discover 'charms'. Each charm is a word which can be deployed at set points to branch the story in new, severe ways. More importantly, you can flip back and forth between these pivotal moments at any time, allowing you to deploy new words in earlier chapters to see what happens.

Except, Beacon Pines is far less choice-driven than I expected. Instead, it's something far rarer and more ambitious in video games: it is a good story, well written, with strong characters you grow to care for.

When Gun Interactive revealed The Texas Chain Saw Massacre last year, I was underwhelmed by its short teaser but excited about its potential. It’s one of my favorite horror movie franchises, partly because of how much it still scares me – every good haunted house has a Leatherface at the end that chases you out to the exit, right? – but also because of its backdrop: Texas. Horror, be it movies or games, typically draws attention to dreary atmospheres, spooky ambiance, perhaps some bad weather, and nighttime. The Texas Chain Saw Massacre bucked that trend in the 1970s.

Don’t expect any more additions to single-player though, as the focus there is bug fixes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The best way I can explain the difference between Devil Daggers and its surprise sequel is comparison to another pair of goth-o-ramas: Devil Daggers is Dark Souls to Hyper Demon's Bloodborne. Both first-person score attack shooters are dressed in similar beautiful cloaks of skulls and gurgling industrial soundscapes, but while Devil Daggers nudges you into cautious survival, Hyper Demon shoves you into aggression. In Hyper Demon, a long and cautious run will likely score lower than a short burst of ultraviolence. What glorious ultraviolence it is!
When I first saw Hyper Demon's trailer, I felt excitement, wonder, and fear. Here's the important thing to realise: the unearthly and incomprehensible violence you see in that trailer is genuinely what the game looks like to play. That's how it feels to play, too.

Nope - the game wasn't what I expected at all. At least, not the 45-minute portion I got to play. Rather, my demo was more of a hardcore puzzler with some exploration elements and the teeniest smattering of action. Don't get me wrong, it was still unsettling and grotesque! Just in more of a brain-training way, if the brain-training was for MIT graduates, or like, the human calculators on University Challenge.

What’s more, according an interview with Gamers Nexus, their reasoning is a lack of “respect” shown to them by Nvidia themselves. Suffice to say, there won’t be an EVGA version of the RTX 4090 or any RTX 40 series GPU that might be announced during Nvidia’s GeForce Beyond event later today.

After several adventures with other devs, sometime-mighty pirate Guybrush Threepwood (a name that invites as many tedious jokes as Benedict Cumberbatch, which is a trap I won't be falling into) is back with his some of his original progenitors Ron Gilbert and Dave Grossman - Gilbert being the director for the first two Islands Monkey.
I was expecting Return To Monkey Island to be a delightful croquembouche of point and click puzzles artfully piled up with puns and meta jokes, all slathered in the sticky, sugary caramel of nostalgia. And it is that. But I wasn't expecting it to contain a gentle rumination on getting old and figuring out what things are really worth caring about.

Many of these fighters made their first appearances in Street Fighter (Ken and Ryu) or Street Fighter II (Blanka, Cammy, Chun-Li, Dee Jay, Dhalsim, E. Honda, Guile, Zangief). However, some fresher faces include Juri (debuted in Street Fighter IV) and Luke (debuted in Street Fighter V), and six all-new characters: Jamie, JP, Kimberly, Lily, Manon, and Marisa.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tokyo Game Show provided an opportunity to try out the latest build of Street Fighter 6. Although Capcom just pulled the curtain back on the next batch of fighters to join the roster, my demo included the first playable sessions for the last trio of reveals: Guile, Juri, and newcomer Kimberly. Since Kimberly was the wildcard of that bunch, I opted to spend most of my hands-on time discovering what she brings to the table. After only a few rounds, I had a tough time wanting to switch to anyone else.
If you haven’t been keeping up, Kimberly is a ninja pupil of Guy who adores the ‘80s and graffiti. She incorporates the latter interest into her acrobatic offense, such as throwing exploding spray cans like they’re shurikens. That’s silly and fantastic. She’s also set to play a pivotal role in t…]]></summary>

The Pokémon franchise has been more prolific than usual as of late, with multiple releases over the past year and another big entry coming soon. However, those without a Switch or looking for a suitable monster-battling alternative should focus on Temtem, which has emerged from years of early-access development. While borrowing heavily from the formula of Nintendo’s massive franchise, its world is fun to explore, and collecting and learning all about the titular Temtems is satisfying.

Given the latter game’s events and the tantalizing trailer for its second part, Rebirth, it had me thinking that it may be a good time to dust off my copy of 2008’s Crisis Core. Square Enix read my mind by announcing a remaster of Zack Fair’s PSP adventure, christening it with the subtitle “Reunion,” giving newcomers the answer to the question of “who the heck was that black-haired fella in Remake?” As for me, I thought I had a good reason to return to the game. After playing a decent chunk of Reunion at Tokyo Game Show, I’m all good. 
My expectations were always reasonable. Reunion is a remaster, not a remake the scale of, well, Remake. That means that feature-wise, the best way to sum it up is “That PSP game? You can pl…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let me fill you in on a little secret most people won't tell you: the real way to enjoy a video game show is at home, comfortably on your couch, watching the event on YouTube. 
Over the years, the game press has done a remarkable job tricking you into thinking otherwise. The shows look extravagant, energetic, and almost like we're getting glimpses into the future, which we then curate into bite-sized news stories and on-demand trailers for our faithful readers back home. 
The reality is much more depressing.
Whether it's E3, PAX, Gamescom, or in this case, Tokyo Game Show, going to a video game trade event means dealing with the near-lethal combination of jetlag and overwork. The brutal FOMO of being in some of the coolest cities in the world but spending all your time in convention halls. The unbelievable cacophony of thousands of people talking at once. The unbelievable smells of thousands of people all standing too close to each other. The never-ending lines of thousands of people all needing to use the toilet at the same time. This doesn't even touch on the unavoidable safety concerns of having a video game conference in the midst of an ongoing pandemic. But I digress.
All that said, there's some fun stuff to look at, like big, gaudy statues and giant booths that likely cost tens of thousands of dollars for games you've never heard of and likely will never play. Stuff that really makes it all worth it. 
While we'd love to fly each and every one of you out to Tokyo, sadly, we only had the budget to fly out two of our full-time employees. So in lieu of attending yourself, please enjoy my curated batch of pictures of what I saw on the show floor. 
Well, there you have it, folks. All the fun of TGS without actually being there. See you next year!]]></summary>

More specifically, these two remasters will be packaged into the same collection and this remastered duo is due out on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC (via Steam) in 2023. The first Suikoden was released in 1995, and its sequel, Suikoden II, was released in 1998. Check out what the remastered versions of these classic games look like in the announcement trailer below: 


As you can see, these remasters are looking excellent, especially in the way that the original look and feel of the sprite imagery remains intact. Here's hoping they feel as great to play as they did back in the day. 
Here are some highlights of this remastered collection from the game's Steam page:

        <updated>2022-09-15T13:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Saturnalia is an upcoming survival horror game with an extremely unique art style announced last month. Now, we know when we can play it because Saturnalia has captured an October 27 release date. 
That's when it will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC (via the Epic Games Store). Developed by Italy-based studio Santa Ragione, the team behind games like Fotonica, MirrorMoon EP, and Wheels of Aurelia, Saturnalia is shaping up to be a great time. You can find out why in the New Gameplay Today segment we recorded that's all about Saturnalia, featuring more than 15 minutes of gameplay, below: 


"[Saturnalia] is a kaleidoscopic adventure inspired in equal parts by authentic Sardinian folklore and classic Italian Giallo horror films," a press release reads. "The story involves a mysterious, centuries-old ritual that occurs every year on the night of the winter solstice in the Italian village of Gravoi. Each of the game's four playable characters must utilize their unique abilities and confront their own personal revelations in order to expose the secrets haunting the town and ultimately escape their doom."
Here are some additional Saturnalia highlights from Santa Ragione: 
Seek clues in a maze-like village with no markers or compass to guide your steps.
Explore the ever-changing town of Gravoi using matches to keep the dark at bay.
Flight and stealth are your only options, as you cannot fight the creature that hunts you.
Immerse yourself in the stop-motion animation and vibrant expressionist art style of Saturnalia for an eerily beautiful atmosphere that is as enthralling as it is chilling.
Control your fate through non-linear progression and a dynamic, adaptive narrative, with unique endgames dependent on player choices.


Saturnalia hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC via the Epic Games Store on October 27.

Of course, you will instantly unlock the character alongside newcomers Sojourn and Junker Queen by purchasing the premium battle pass.

Set within the once-bustling city of Los Angeles, the game pulls inspiration from 80s action movies like Die Hard and George A. Romero's Dawn Of The Dead and features iconic locations overrun with hordes of zombies you can eviscerate piece by piece.

It feature more Sonic Frontiers gameplay, which consists of the blue blur climbing colossal machines as if they're mountains, but when he reaches the top of one, he stumbles upon something very special: a Chaos Emerald. As any Sonic fan likely knows, collecting all of these will help the hedgehog transform into Super Sonic, a Saiyan-like version of the character that's faster and stronger. And sure enough, that's exactly what happens in this new TGS Sonic Frontiers trailer. 
Check it out for yourself below: 


As you can see, this is the first appearance of Super Sonic in Sonic Frontiers' marketing thus far. It's also the first confirmation that Super Sonic is in the game. This trailer is another exciting Sonic Frontiers trailer showcasing more of what we can expect when the game hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on November 8.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio has announced that its Yakuza-adjacent Judgment series will make its way to Steam for the first time. The best news: they're out on Steam today.
Judgment and Lost Judgment come to Steam on September 14. This marks the first appearance of each game on PC (though Judgment has been available to stream on PC via Stadia). 
This news is especially significant given that RGG Studio originally planned to release Lost Judgment on PC when it launched last year. However, that version was nixed when the talent agency representing actor Takuya Kimura, who portrays protagonist Takayuki Yagami, enforced strict policies about allowing Kimura’s likeness on PC. Both parties' inability to agree threatened Judgment’s future as a franchise since RGG Studio has pushed for more of its titles to come to Steam; every mainline Yakuza game is available on the storefront, for example. It would appear those issues have been ironed out, which bodes well for the potential of a third game. 
The Judgment games are noir action thrillers that adhere to the same open-world design template as the Yakuza series. Though the plots largely unfold in Kamurocho, the series stars a new cast of characters and emphasizes investigative gameplay. Players control Yagami, a disgraced lawyer and private detective who works to unravel a pair of conspiracy plots. In Yakuza fashion, he also has his hands full helping his colorful clients and random citizens solve more light-hearted – or comically absurd – problems.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio, the team behind the popular and long-running Yakuza franchise, revealed yesterday that it's remaking Like A Dragon: Ishin and releasing it for the first time in the West next year. That reveal trailer looked great, but it was short and sweet. 
Now, RGG has released a new "Ambush" trailer that showcases more than five minutes of Like A Dragon: Ishin, giving us a better look at this upcoming Yakuza spinoff. Like A Dragon: Ishin was first released on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 3 in 2014, but it never came out in the West. This new release rebuilds Like A Dragon: Ishin from the ground up, and you can check out how great it's looking in the trailer below: 


Like A Dragon: Ishin takes place in the Late Edo Period of Japan, in the 1860s. After completing his special sword training, Sakamoto Ryoma returns to his home in Tosa, only to find conflict against a prestigious samurai. You can read more about it in our story here.
Like A Dragon: Ishin hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on February 21.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio announced that Yakuza 8 is called Like A Dragon 8 today, and that game's announcement trailer revealed that former series protagonist Kazuma Kiryu is back alongside Yakuza: Like A Dragon protagonist Ichiban Kasuga. Now, RGG has announced Like A Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name, a new Yakuza game that will follow Kiryu's life following the events of Yakuza 6: The Song of Life leading up to Like A Dragon 8. 
In the reveal trailer, which aired today during the RGG Summit 2022 showcase, we see Kiryu at a monastery. Having left behind his former Yakuza life, as well as his name, Kiryu, who now goes by Joryu, is trying to live the life of a monk. However, he's seemingly pulled into one more job – an escort mission – and if today's Like A Dragon 8 trailer is any indication, it seems this final job pulls him back into the life he had put behind him. 
Check it out for yourself in the reveal trailer below:


As you can see, The Man Who Erased His Name is shaping up to be a treat for longtime Yakuza fans and it seems like necessary playing in the leadup to 2024's Like A Dragon 8. Like A Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC in 2023.
