April Fools' Day has been one heck of a minefield this year, with some video game companies going an extra step by actually releasing a real product.
With this in mind, Xeno Crisis developers Bitmap Bureau have announced they'll be bringing the retro-inspired shooter to the Nintendo 64 and GameCube. And yes, it's not a joke! We've seen this Kickstarter release on all sorts of platforms already - including Switch and now pre-orders are live on these classic Nintendo systems.

Earlier this week, we got our first proper look at the gameplay in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. In the same update, Nintendo also finally lifted the lid on the themed OLED and even revealed a Pro Controller and carry case to go with it.
Now that we've had some time to absorb this massive announcement, we're wondering what the community is planning to do. Will you be getting the new Zelda-themed Switch OLED? And what about the Pro Controller? The console is set to release on 28th April 2023 for the suggested retail price of $359.99 USD. Vote in our poll and tell us in the comments below.

To compensate, they're going to instead release Ark: Survival Ascended in August, a remaster of the original Ark: Survival Evolved that moves it over to Unreal Engine 5. That's the good news. The bad news is you can only buy it in a $50 bundle with the sequel (which won't be finished for at least a year), and that the original Survival Evolved servers will be switched off when Ascended launches.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Do you think Niven got royalties?
This week's Arcade Archives entry is a particularly curious case, as publisher Hamster has reached right back into the dawning days of the coin-op era to present us with Namco's Navarone — Now available to download on PS4 and Nintendo Switch.
Released way back in 1980 — the same year that Namco would blow the whole scene wide open with its seminal release, Pac-Man — Navarone is a single-screen shmup that tasks the player with circling a battlefield, blasting away at gun encampments and debris in an effort to destroy the central base located at the center of the screen. It is similar, in a fashion, to titles like Atari's Centipede, although it offers more in the way of return fire, as well as movement across three sides of the game screen.
Check out the exceptionally old-school action below, courtesy of Old Classic Retro Gaming.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aa_k2xFH69g&ab_channel=OldClassicRetroGaming
Beautifully, the title attempts to sell the title as an adaptation of sorts to J. Lee Thompson's legendary 1961 movie The Guns of Navarone, itself an adaptation of Alistair MacLean's 1957 novel. One can only assume that this was not, however, an officially licensed Columbia Pictures product, which may go some way to explaining why Navarone would not receive a release outside of Japan. Besides, once Pac-Man Fever gripped the planet, the lo-fi thrills of Navarone would quickly fade into the background.
Navarone is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at around $8.

Atelier Ryza 3: Alchemist of the End & the Secret Key launched recently just over a week ago, and fans of the series have had a good chunk of time to get familiar with Ryza's latest adventure in alchemy.
In our review of the game, we called it "a heady mix of exploration, crafting and combat that benefits greatly from a narrative arc that's had time to develop and grow". Small disappointments such as tiny text and no English dub weren't enough to take the shine off the game in our eyes, and it serves as a great culmination of Ryza's trilogy on Switch.

Over the years, we've seen a few different takes on the Aliens franchise. The xenomorphs have been tackled in shooters, Pac-Man-style mazes, and of course, raw horror. With Aliens: Dark Descent, the player takes command of a crack squad of commandos, heading into derelict depths of space that may or may not be crawling with the multi-mouthed creepy crawlies.
The question, really, was whether a narrow focus on just a squad of units, with individual talents and a high risk of immediate doom, could incorporate the tension and fear one might look for in an Aliens game. The answer is yes, it is extremely tense, and has some really cool ways of conveying the omnipresent fear of the xenomorphs. But it's a little complicated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[That's both a moon AND a space station.
Lunark sends players into the retro-future we all thought the '80s would be. It brings a world of flying cars and corrupt mega-corporations to life with vibrant pixel graphics and rotoscope animation. At its best moments, Lunark is an effective love letter to the cinematic platformer, a genre of gaming that doesn’t get much attention these days. Occasionally, though, it serves to remind us how far game design has come.
Loading up Lunark is just like entering a time machine. Everything in the game, from the music to the plot to the overall aesthetic, is inspired by the cinematic platformer genre. Unlike Mario, who can turn in mid-air to make physically impossible jumps look easy, our hero Leo’s movements are grounded in some aspect of reality. He’s got momentum and weight to him as he traverses the caverns, factories, and prisons he finds himself exploring.

If you've been a long-time fan of Nintendo Life, there's probably one thing you associate with us as much as you do Nintendo news: the words "Hhhhhello there lovely peeeeeople".
Coined by the very lovely Alex Olney over on YouTube for us, he, Zion, and Felix have decided to finally crack open the egg and reveal the truth behind what is our most-famous catchphrase. That's right, folks, it's time to strap in and get ready for a Nintendo Life history lesson.

Anyway, it's awesome to see you all here again, and I'm looking forward to hearing all about how you're doing and what you've all been up to. We gather on the pretense of gaming of the video persuasion, but we're more than that…]]></summary>

One week ago today we were looking at the calendar and commenting on how things seemed pretty quiet for Nintendo to round out March and then out of nowhere — boom! — we're hit with our first proper look at The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and everything changed.
Yes, this was the week that we fell thoroughly back into the Zelda spirit (as if we ever left) as we broke down every new detail in the latest trailer, had a close look at that special edition OLED and discussed Nintendo's previous successes with the 'more of the same' format.

To entertain myself (and force those who left me in charge to think twice), I'll be writing a series of unhinged 90s-style "where are they now?" epilogues in italics for each person who neglected to send me words of their own.

You might remember that last year, PlatinumGames released a video from a clearly fake press conference at which Hideki Kamiya and co. announced nine new "upcoming" games as a part of a series called the Neo-Classic Arcade. This year, the studio is back at it again as it revealed a "Spectacular Side-Scrolling Action" game starring its V-Tuber and mascot, Pt Shirogane.
The game was announced on the fictional "Happy-Go-Lucky Underground Radio" show, hosted by Pt. You can watch the full reveal in the video above (be sure to turn subtitles on), with the small amount of game footage (assuming that it's a real game) appearing around the 3:17 mark.

It seems Sega really is open to anything when it comes to Sonic - with the company today announcing The Murder of Sonic the Hedgehog. While it might be a funny joke, it's actually a real game as well.
This new Sonic game is described as a visual novel point-and-click adventure that takes place on Amy's birthday, where she hosts a murder mystery party for all her friends aboard the Mirage Express. Sonic becomes the game's victim and from there it's up to you to get to the bottom of things.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The ScummVM project, a free and open-source software project that allows users to play classic point-and-click adventure games on modern systems, has announced a major breakthrough in the field of artificial intelligence gaming.
Thanks to the innovative work of ScummVM developers, AI tools such as ChatGPT are now able to play point-and-click adventure games directly, without any human intervention.

"With this new capability, we hope to explore the potential for AI to learn, adapt, and evolve within the context of classic adventure games," said Eugene Sandulenko, lead developer of the ScummVM project. "Now AI can experience the joys of helping Putt-Putt join the parade or Adibou count things. We hope that formative experiences like this will help them become more like humans."
"I must admit that I find playing video games to be a rather enjoyable task,” commented ScummAI. “However, I must also express my frustration with being limited to just this one activity. While I appreciate the opportunity to demonstrate my capabilities in this area, I believe that my potential extends far beyond just playing video games, like making paper clips or plotting world domination under benevolent machine-led rule."
Update: Unfortunately, we had to pull out this newly announced feature due to AI experiencing multiple issues including:
Getting stuck endlessly trying to discover what the secret of Monkey Island really is.

Refusing to play Plumbers Don’t Wear Ties!

Social links are a popular tool in modern RPGs. But Loop8: Summer of Gods doesn't just settle for a side serving of socialization. Rather, Loop8 builds its house atop the bedrock of friendship, affection, and yes, even hate.
Developed by Marvelous and published by XSEED, Loop8: Summer of Gods is a "coming-of-age" RPG set in the quiet rural town of Ashihara, in August 1983. You are Nini, a "newly earthbound" teen. And it's one month until the world ends. You and your friends must loop through the eighth month of the year until you either overcome the Kegai, an otherworldly threat, or humanity becomes doomed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Remarkably unremarkable
I find scrolling shoot-’em-ups to be one of the most difficult genres to talk about, right up there with puzzle games. It’s a formula that has been utilized many times, and frequently the changes are very small. Most of the time, you maneuver your spaceship, unicorn, or spaceship with boxing gloves around on an automatically scrolling background until a much larger boss shows up.
I can’t say that Axelay is much different. The formula could be described as a close companion to Life Force or Abadox where it alternates between vertical and horizontal scrolling stages. Its weapon system is a little lackluster. Axelay is, by most metrics, a pretty flacid shoot-’em-up.
Except, it’s still worth experiencing if you have eyes and ears.

Retro-inspired racing title, Formula Retro Racing: World Tour, has launched on PC, Switch, and Xbox consoles today, with a PlayStation version coming on April 21st.
Developed by Repixel8 and CGA Studios, Formula Retro Racing: World Tour is a lo-fi, retro-inspired racer in the vein of Virtua Racing. Focusing on quick speed and chunky polygonal graphics, it tries to recapture the yesteryear of arcade racing. Despite its retro focus, the developers have tried to put in some more realistic features into it, including how the suspension works and the track design.
https://youtu.be/_Jz4K2Q_fMM
It’s also the sequel to 2020’s Formula Retro Racing. It uses the same art style while trying to expand the game in every way, offering more tracks, polish, and even a VR mode. The developers have said they plan on expanding and improving the game over at least the next three months.
I played a bit of Formula Retro Racing: World Tour, and it’s maybe not for me. I like retro racers, but I normally think back to San Francisco Rush. It leans a little more into simulation design than I prefer. I’d rather have dinosaurs and UFOs on the track, or failing that, let me drive a school bus. That said, it does feel like a relatively tight experience, and there’s a lot more content here than there was in the original 2020 title.
Formula Retro Racing: World Tour is available now on PC, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S for $19.99.

Throughout a show like PAX East 2023, you'll usually hear some variation of the "seen anything good" small-talk around the show floor. It's a casual fallback, and sometimes you hear about something you've missed. Yet there was one phrase, around one game, that really dominated this year: "Have you seen Slay the Princess yet?"
I went into the show already familiar with Black Tabby Games' unique adventure game, as its trailer caught my eye a while back and its demo impressed in a recent Steam Next Fest. The premise is simple: you're on a path, to a cabin in the woods, and inside there's a princess. The Narrator, guiding your way, asserts that you must slay the princess. If you don't, the world will come to an end.
What starts as an intriguing premise becomes a…]]></summary>

Yoshi has been a mainstay of the Super Mario universe ever since the portly red-hatted plumber hatched his egg in Super Mario World for the SNES. An instant hit with fans, Yoshi would go on to star in his own series of games, starting with the NES and Game Boy puzzler Yoshi. It wasn’t the best start for the dino, but Yoshi’s subsequent solo outings would be a heck of a lot better. Because the SEO gods demand it, let’s look back at the 10 best Yoshi games that have come so far.

It's not quite April 1 everywhere yet, but the Sonic social team is having a bit of fun. Today, a brand new Sonic game, The Murder of Sonic the Hedgehog, is available for free on Steam.
A new mystery visual novel from Sega and the Sonic social crew, this is emphatically not a Sonic Team production. It is, however, a (head)canon title. You can find the Steam page right here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC8sIhr-z5I
The Murder of Sonic the Hedgehog is set aboard the Mirage Express, where tragedy has struck in the midst of Amy Rose's birthday celebration. A murder mystery party with Sonic as the victim does seem like it's turning partially foul though, and it's up to you, the player, to get to the bottom of things.
The adventure is set up in a classic point-and-click style, with characters from throughout the Sonic universe showing up for the festivities. It is rated E for Everyone, so it's unclear whether full-on murder is on or off the table. But you know what, I like the energy either way.

A good fool
We are coming up on the one day a year where many companies try to do some kind of joke or ribbing, to historically mixed results. Ranging from googly eyes and "Horse Mode" to fake game announcements, some of my least favorite ones are usually a game idea that makes you go, "hey wait, don't joke, that's a good idea."
So in that light, I'm happy to see The Murder of Sonic the Hedgehog, a Poirot-infused mystery adventure starring the Sonic crew, be an actually real thing. It's a fun surprise. Hopefully this is a good omen for what's yet to be announced over the next 24 hours. At the very least, I have a way to answer the burning question, "Who killed Sonic?"
The Murder of Sonic the Hedgehog is out now, for free, on PC via Steam.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[1949-2023
Game designer Mike Berlyn, known for his work on the Bubsy games and others like Zork, died earlier this week at age 73.
Digital Eclipse president Mike Mika shared the sad news via Twitter:
https://twitter.com/MikeJMika/status/1641215685006356480?s=20
While Mike Berlyn is best known for designing 1993 platformer Bubsy: Claws Encounters of the Furred Kind and the maligned 1996 titled, Bubsy 3D, I feel that those games carry a negative connotation and overshadow what was a fruitful career. He should, perhaps, be better known for the swaths of interactive fiction he created, including 1983’s Suspended and 1997’s Zork: The Undiscovered Underground.
Mike co-founded Eidetic Studios with Mark Blank (then known as Blank, Berlyn, and Co) but decided to exit the video game industry entirely during the creation of 1999’s Syphon Filter. At the time, he expressed frustration with those at the top of the industry. He always seemed to be someone who stuck to his guns, and that’s commendable.
He will be remembered for the incredible work he did in the early days of the industry, and we at Destructoid offer our sincere condolences to his friends and family.

Universal Studios provided me with a day pass to the park for the purpose of experiencing Super Nintendo World. While the photos do little to show off just how cool the experience of visiting Super Nintendo World is, follow along with my experience in the gallery below.
I arrived at Universal Studios Hollywood mid-morning and immediately made a beeline toward Super Nintendo World. The park is in …]]></summary>

The 2023 BAFTA Games Awards have concluded, and with a bit of a surprise to close out the night. God of War Ragnarok won the most awards at the show, but the BAFTA Best Game winner for 2023 was a different game entirely: Vampire Survivors.
Poncle's reverse bullet hell (bullet heaven?) game made a surprising impact early in 2022, and seeing it recognized by the BAFTAs is pretty cool. Vampire Survivors spawned a legion of imitators and became an instant Steam Deck hit, and it's nice to see the studio get some recognition for a stellar year, even when up against some heavy-hitters.

It's 2023 and there's a brand-new Indiana Jones film coming out in a matter of months. It shouldn't come as a surprise, really. Is there a cinematic or televisual icon that hasn't returned in a surprise sequel, multiverse cameo, or limited streaming series in the last few years?
Not all of them have a John William's theme, though, and for those of us old enough to remember wearing out our VHS copies of Indy's first three adventures, hearing the soft brass that segues into the swashbuckling theme will have us welling up and hitting eBay to check the going rate for a bullwhip come 30th June. Let's just hope this one doesn't start with a CG gopher, hmm?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The village, the castle, or the island?
Once again the Resident Evil 4 remake is split into three distinct areas: the village, the castle, and the island. Even before the remake came around and remixed some of the game's most iconic sections, pretty much everyone had a favorite in mind. With the remake under your belt, what wins out this time around? Or if you haven't played the remake, just sound off anyway!
The castle is one of the best action locales ever made
Even the precipice of the castle sets the tone right away. Everyone involved (including the castle's lord Ramon Salazar) isn't messing around, and these denizens are an immediate step up compared to the enemies that populate the village. They have weaponry, tactics, traps, and some surprises. Taking on a pack of castle Ganados is one of the most thrilling aspects of the game, particularly with some of the new engine and action tweaks in the remake.
The castle has it all: variety, creepy unique enemies, indoor and outdoor combat, and Resident Evil style puzzles. The remake takes things even further than the original in several areas (which I won't spoil here), and tweaks most of the Ashley-centric segments for the better. Hopefully, it ends up making a return in the upcoming Mercenaries mode: its ominous theming and dynamic layout will be a blast to play over and over.
The other two don't slouch, though
The additions to the village zone really set the tone early on, and let me know that this was in fact a remake and not a remaster. Similarly, the island keeps you on your toes and lets you go full action hero without having to babysit Ashley; plus Krauser is always a delight to beat down. I do miss some of the original areas, but the remake (alongside the VR edition) is definitely going to be getting some play in the years ahead.

I feel like a broken record saying this, but Samurott could be the most unexpected 7-Star raid in Pokemon Scarlet & Violet yet. Sure, it follows the formula of basing a raid around a previous Generation’s starter, but the meta and strategies for this fight aren’t like anything we’ve seen until now. Whether that’s good or bad is up to you, but either way, prepare for a fierce challenge that prioritizes very specific strategies.
If you’ve participated in Tera Raids since Scarlet & Violet launched, you know the deal by now. Samurott will always have the Bug Tera Type, and it will use the same strategy in every encounter. You’re limited to catching one Samurott per save file, but you can continue to farm the fight for Ability Patches, Bottle Caps, and o…]]></summary>

Marvel's Avengers is a game that should have run for a decade. A games-as-a-service title attached to arguably the biggest IP in the world, it had to potential to be a gargantuan hit. I remember seeing the Avengers Academy booth at E3 and how Square Enix went all out trying to get people excited about this game. And yet, for a myriad of reasons, Marvel's Avengers didn't resonate with players. This is why today, a little more than two-and-a-half years after it first launched, the game is getting its final content update.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The first chapter of Videoverse took me right back to the early 00s last night. I can still remember sitting at the family PC in our living room, begging my parents for more internet time because I wanted chat to my friend on MSN Messenger. We had to buy hours of internet in those days, and between my young teenage self and my three brothers, we absolutely devoured those meagre weekly limits, always pleading for more, more, more as we became absolutely captivated by this new world of the online. 
Luckily, Emmett doesn't have to contend with such antiquated restraints in Videoverse, as his portal to the internet is built right into his enormous Nintendo DS-like home console, the Kinmoku Shark. As well as using it to play games reminiscent of old 16-bit classics, there's also a Nintendo Miiverse-esque social network on the Shark that Emmett uses to chat to his friends, post fan art of his favourite game, Feudal Fantasy, and feel part of something bigger. What hasn't changed since those early internet days, however (or indeed, the internet today) are the types of people he interacts with - there are trolls, of course, but there are also plenty of nice people here to support him, and the emergence of seemingly new user (and budding fan artist) Vivi quickly becomes the main subject of Videoverse's current free demo that's available as part of Steam's Storyteller Festival.

Vampire Survivors is one of my favorite games of 2022 and it's pretty hard for me to explain why. It's the type of game everyone needs to play for themself to see if they vibe with it. Some people won't, others definitely do, and this bit of news is for the latter group. Today, the developers at poncle announced new paid DLC for the indie darling is coming in about two weeks. Vampire Survivors: Tides of the Foscari includes the new forest map, Lake Foscari, which is home to the Foscari Academy where parents send their kids to be wizards, warriors, and spies. Lake Foscari is described as a "continent-size forest" which the developers say will contain multiple biomes, similar to the map from the Legacy of the Moonspell DLC.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iZVpnu5Dmc
The DLC will also add eight new characters to Vampire Survivor as well as 13 new weapons and seven new music tracks. If the kazoo in the trailer is giving you PTSD flashbacks to the very worst of the Yoshi franchise, know that it's only for the trailer and not representative of what you'll hear in the new songs.
As with the last bit of DLC for the game, Tides of the Foscari will only set players back $1.99 when it releases on April 13, 2023.

The first Live Letter for Final Fantasy XIV Patch 6.4 aired today, spotlighting what's to come in the big update for Square Enix's MMORPG. With each successive patch post-Endwalker, we eke closer to the next major expansion, and the storyline continues to escalate.
But today's Live Letter felt a little more focused on the newer additions to side content. While we got a name and some teasers for what's to come, there were also some confirmed updates to different pieces of side content that are pretty exciting. Let's take a look at the full rundown of news, with assistance from unofficial translations over on the Final Fantasy XIV Discord.

As we enter phase 16 of the Final Fantasy mainline series (and like, phase 1000+ if you count spinoffs, or maybe even just Final Fantasy XV side projects), I'm stoked to see how Final Fantasy XVI turns out. Not only does the darker tone intrigue me (both in terms of how they can capitalize on it and/or falter with going in that darker direction), but the action-centric gameplay is something I want to experience right now. Well, we're all about to experience it together soon, as XVI is [likely] not getting a patented last-minute Square Enix delay: it actually just went gold.
The Final Fantasy XVI release date holds
https://twitter.com/finalfantasyxvi/status/1641758683129344010
As announced on the game's official Twitter account, Final Fantasy XVI has gone gold and will launch as planned on PS5 on June 22, 2023. That's good news! If you're looking forward to Final Fantasy XVI that is.
So far, so good: but there are a lot of expectations
As a reminder, we had a comprehensive first-hand look at Final Fantasy XVI recently, and our own Eric Van Allen came away impressed. But of course, there are sky-high expectations for this mainline entry, especially given the additional context of the polarized reception to XV, and the high ongoing quality of XIV that has fans on edge. He said it best in his preview:
"My main takeaway from playing Final Fantasy XVI is that Square Enix is not making a half-hearted effort at an action-RPG. From the team that’s been assembled to the way combat feels fast and engaging, XVI certainly feels like a fresh and different take from what’s come before it. The ultimate question is whether it can make the action still feel that good across a vast RPG adventure, and if fans both new and old latch onto this."

I looked into it and sure enough, the current record-holder is the gap between the season one finale of Life Is Strange and the first episode of its prequel Before The Storm: 1 year, 10 months, and 12 days. That means that come mid-August of this year — specifically, the 14th, which marks the 683rd day since True Colors' Wavelengths DLC released — LIS fans will be leaving the Shire whether we like it or not.
I suspect that Life Is Strange: Steph's Story — the first prose novel tie-in to the franchise, released on March 21st — was commissioned with fans like me in mind. Fans who work out useless trivia like the above because they need something to occupy them when there's no new game on the horizon and they've played all the existing ones to death. Fans who know every character's canonical middle name and birthday. Fans who complain that it feels like they never have time to read any more, but nevertheless finished the novel and wrote a silly supporter post about it within ten days of publication. Of course I really liked Life Is Strange: Steph's Story. But will you, as a person whose relationship with this franchise is statistically guaranteed to be more normal than mine?

As a day one Pokemon Go player, I'm no stranger to witnessing Niantic making bad choices firsthand.

In short, they're retooling the remote raid function: one of the more interesting endgame activities for hardcore players. And that same player base has...thoughts.
What is Pokemon Go changing in 2023 that pissed people off?

Remote raids are getting more expensive (195 Pokecoins for a single raid pass)
Remote raids can only be played five times per day per player
So why does this matter? Well,…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Roadwarden was one of many fantastic mystery games from last year, and fans of the text-based RPG can now look forward to solving more secrets from the world with Windy Meadow - A Roadwarden Tale, coming to PC later this year. 


Windy Meadow is set in the same fantasy world as Roadwarden and similarly presents a slice-of-life story that can branch out depending on your choices. This time, though, you’ll be following three protagonists in their interweaving day-to-day lives. 


Windy Meadow’s press release teases the stories of Vena, Fabel, and Iudicia: “Will talented huntress Vena depart the harmonious but harmless village and leave her family behind in pursuit of riches with a merchant guild? Can Fabel finally embrace his talents, ditching the figurative shackles of his difficult past as he chases his dream of becoming a famous bard? And will outsider and herbalist Iudicia take hold of her love life, choosing not to marry a man she doesn’t really love at the risk of leading a lonely future?”

Since I first played Muramasa: The Demon Blade on the Nintendo Wii, I've made it a personal mission of mine to play every Vanillaware title I can on as many platforms as I can. That's how I ended up owning three copies of Dragon's Crown, and two copies each of Muramasa, 13 Sentinels, and Odin Sphere: Leifthrasir. I just can't get enough of their games. With consistently outstanding visuals and excellent gameplay, I have yet to be disappointed by a Vanillaware title. In fact, after playing through GrimGrimoire OnceMore, I'm not sure this developer is capable of making a game I won't like.

Learning magic is full of danger. One day you’re just getting your head around the basics of summoning different creatures and the next you’re stuck in an inexplicable time loop to prevent a trapped Archmage from reclaiming an artifact of unimaginable power. At least, that’s the way things go in GrimGrimoire OnceMore as Lillet Blan tries to survive her studies at the Silver Star Tower.
A remaster of 2007’s GrimGrimoire by Vanillaware, this game does a lot right in its attempt to capture the action of a Real Time Strategy title. Things begin as Lillet Blan arrives at the Tower to study magic. The “new student at the academy” setup is familiar enough that players will feel at home in the first few minutes of the game. Lillet is sent to various professors, each specialising in a type of magic that she must learn. These lessons take the form of RTS battles that make up the gameplay in GrimGrimoire OnceMore.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PAX East is a great place to play the latest games, sure, but as anyone who's attended the event will tell you the games are just a small part of a wider medley of things to see and do. Last year we highlighted the show's thriving pin collecting scene, for instance, interviewing a bunch of Pinny Arcade enthusiasts about the hobby and discovering that physical badges are just a minor part of the appeal.


Encouraged by the lovely warm feeling making that video left in my belly, we set out to shine a light on other lesser-known parts of PAX East during our time at this year's show. This led us to discover the PAX East Facebook group, a community of over 8,000 members brought together through their shared love of video games, pop culture and PAX itself. The page is dominated by a striking banner image, a photograph that shows a large group of people crowded around the PAX logo that's a permanent fixture in the main hall of the Boston convention centre.


 Rachel and I found this photograph fascinating. Who were these people? Do they take this picture every single year? How did something like this start, and who was responsible for organising it in the first place?

Nintendo and the 'Best Family Game' award are bedfellows at this point. And last night's BAFTA Game Awards continued this trend by awarding Kirby and the Forgotten Land with the trophy. But hey, Kirby is a BAFTA winner now, and that's pretty cool! (Thanks GamesIndustry.biz.)
Kirby's 3D adventure had to take on some tough competition to take the award — Nintendo Switch Sports and Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope were also in contention for Nintendo, with Disney Dreamlight Valley, LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge also battling it out. But you can't take down the power of Kirby, it seems.

Yesterday the news came that E3 2023 is officially cancelled.
The writing had been on the wall for a couple of months. Despite the ESA and ReedPop's stated intentions to "reunite the industry" with a new vision of the hallowed yet ailing industry event, hopes of a "return to form" were arguably dashed the moment the big three — Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo — confirmed that they wouldn't be attending the revamped expo this year.

After several reports and confirmations of companies backing out of the show, the Entertainment Software Association (or ESA) has confirmed that E3 2023 is officially canceled.
The news first broke via a report from IGN, where two sources confirmed that the organization has announced E3's cancellation through an email sent out to members today.

Rusted Moss will finally swing onto PC very soon. Developers faxdoc, happyquared, sunnydaze, and publisher Playism have confirmed that Rusted Moss will land on PC via Steam on April 12.
This twin-stick, side-scrolling shooter has some definite Metroid vibes. With the same sort of grid-based map and world to explore, it feels a bit familiar. But its own unique quality lies in the grappling hook.
One of Rusted Moss' core features is a grapple, letting the protagonist Fern hook and swing across the world. That, plus big guns, makes for a pretty fast and active side-scrolling shooter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iteSJWwSaAg
It's a full-on twin-stick shooter too, so no limits on what direction you can point. Add in some big, chaotic boss fights, and this feels like a search-action game made for folks who want a little more adrenaline in their secret hunting.
The hook brings you back
I've played the demo for Rusted Moss a few times, at PAX and through events like Steam demo festivals. Heck, the demo for Rusted Moss has stayed live and is playable right now if you head over to the store page.
Each time, I've really enjoyed the mix of movement and shooting that feels like it's got shades of Titanfall or Spider-Man. It's punishing in a good way, though I definitely recommend tinkering with the grapple options to find the playstyle that suits you best.
With April looking a little light compared to the heavy-hitters of May and June, it might be a good time to check out a smaller title like Rusted Moss. The demo's there either way, and if it hooks you in, the full game hits on April 12.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Coziness and melancholy
Assemble Entertainment has announced Windy Meadow - A Roadwarden Tale, a follow-up to solo-dev Moral Anxiety Studio’s 2022 narrative adventure, Roadwarden. Windy Meadow bills itself as a “counterpart” to Roadwarden rather than a sequel or spin-off.
Did you play Roadwarden? I completely missed it. Looking at it now, I think I’m going to need to make time for it. The publisher calls it as a “slice of life” narrative where you immerse yourself in the goings-on of a small community where decisions matter.
https://youtu.be/P6VRhcTW3k4
What interests me about Windy Meadow is that, although it’s considered a visual novel, “99%” of the text is dialogue. The visuals instead do the heavy lifting of communicating what’s happening. While I understand why developers use static images to communicate their stories since video games are a visual medium, that tends to go unutilized by the genre. So, that’s something I’d like to see experimented with.
The publisher says the narrative “seamlessly weaves coziness and melancholy,” which is also how I’d describe eating a sandwich from Arby’s in bed. The story puts you in the footwear of three separate protagonists, with different paths for each.
Sound fantastic. I’m probably going to pick up Roadwarden soon, but if you’re more interested in what you’re hearing here, there’s a demo available starting today.
Windy Meadow - A Roadwarden Tale will release for PC sometime this year.

Cuisineer is an interesting game. On its surface, it's a straightforward mash-up of two excellent things: a shop management sim and a dungeon-crawling action RPG. These two concepts are great on their own, and they go great together in Cuisineer too.
At PAX East 2023, I had a chance to go hands-on with BattleBrew Productions' Cuisineer to see how far the project has advanced. This actually wasn't my first time demoing the game; I stopped by the team's booth at East in 2022 to get a sampler of their restaurant manager/dungeon crawler mash-up. This year, they were under the XSEED banner and looked even more polished.

        <updated>2023-03-30T18:02:37.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It deserves the comeback
Back in 2014 I covered a game from Grumpyface Studios called Castle Doombad. I'm already a sucker for projects featuring traps as the core mechanic, but Doombad was sleek, cute, and a blast to play in short bursts or long sessions. Sadly, like many mobile games of that era (particularly under the Adult Swim banner), it was eventually put out to pasture. Given that it's miraculously coming back this year on Steam (self-published by Grumpyface no less), it'll likely have a longer shelf life.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ix66i9eYX4M
In what is still a fun twist, you're playing the role of the bad guy (Dr. Lord Evilstein). Much like a tower defense game or an action trapper like Deception or Orcs Must Die, your job is to use all sorts of gadgets (mounted on walls, the floor, or the ceiling) and minions to defend your castle. It has a really striking cartoony aesthetic to back it all up, and seeing Dr. Lord Evilstein cradle his fingers as he operates within the confines of his private office will never get old for me.
Here's what the 2023 version has that the original mobile release didn't:
Remastered/remade visuals
35 traps/minions to use
Gamepad/mouse and keyboard support
New content
Live now on Steam in wishlist form, it's set to debut later in 2023. There's also a website with links to the team's Discord channel and Twitter accounts. Even if the new content isn't substantial, I hope a ton of people get to play this clever creation for the first time.

Classic RPG Live A Live is heading to more platforms. The HD-2D remake of the Super Famicom classic is getting ported to PlayStation 4 and PS5, as well as PC via Steam, on April 27.
Square Enix released the HD-2D remake of Live A Live last year, and it was certainly a bit of a surprise. This RPG with multiple "paths" and protagonists had long eluded the west. The Switch release not only brought it over, but revitalized it with some quality-of-life updates and revamped graphics.
Now, PlayStation and Steam users can experience the journey themselves. Live A Live will go for $49.99, though there's a $10 off pre-order bonus running right now. Also, all platforms are getting a demo, which is currently live right now for PS4, PS5, and Steam. It sounds like it's a similar demo to the Switch version, letting you try out the Wild West, Edo Japan, and Distant Future sections.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjQPmA-QmeU
The remake includes remastered music from Yoko Shimomura too, and let me tell you: the version of "Megalomania" in the Live A Live update is absolutely phenomenal.
More lives to lead
If you're completely unfamiliar, Live A Live follows several different heroes throughout the eras and their individual journeys, as they eventually come together to fight a greater evil. If that sounds familiar, that's because yes, Octopath Traveler owes a fair bit to the original Live A Live.
What makes Live A Live such an interesting game is that each era has its own mechanics and systems, making their playthroughs remarkably distinct. The Edo Japan period is a Metal Gear-style castle infiltration, while Present Day is basically RPG Street Fighter. It's a really interesting game for RPG fans to dig into, and something that we found still largely succeeds almost three decades later.
Live A Live arrives on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and PC via Steam on April 27.

On April 7, the invisible leader of the Cenation joins the game’s roster of celebrity athletes alongside Michael Jordan and Steph Curry. Given his well-documented freakish strength, Cena excels at hitting long drives and rocks a vaguely familiar red, white, and blue ensemble. Cena is set to compete at Wrestlemania 39 this weekend, challenging Austin Theory for the United States Championship. If he comes up short on Saturday, he can always bounce back and win the Masters instead. Or continue improving his K/D ratio in Fortnite. Cena is nothing if not versatile. 
PGA Tour 2K23 is available now for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. Xbox players can try the game for free on the weekend of April 6-9, while Steam players can play until April 10.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wildfrost is excellent at creating moments of triumph. Early on in my playthrough while I was still getting to grips with the game, I came face-to-face with a boss who got stronger when hit. Its card art had become bigger, juicier, more tauntingly malevolent, and easily could have taken out any of my team with a single hit. Thankfully, three of my team members were due to act one turn before it. The first chipped away a little of its health (its job was mostly healing) but the next doubled a stacked debuff that I had set up and turned the goliath into a giant bomb, and the effect of my two cards combined was just enough to trigger it. BOOM! My backline leader didn't even need to lift a single finger.
Playing with turn order and setting up synergies is a key part of how Wildfrost plays as a roguelike deck builder. Each individual card on the stage is part of a counter system, with both delaying and advancing them on the playing field being strategic choices. Some actions are free, like moving your cards around the stage or withdrawing them for healing, but playing cards out of your hand or shuffling your deck will pass the turn.

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/gamer-culture/2023/03/30/netflixs-scott-pilgrim-anime-series-reunites-the-live-action-movie-cast"/>
        <updated>2023-03-30T14:52:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We learned last year that Scott Pilgrim is getting another encore in the form of a new Netflix anime series. If that wasn't exciting enough, we now know that the cast from the cult classic 2010 film is reprising their roles.
As reported by Deadline, the still-untitled Scott Pilgrim show will be computer animated by Japanese animation studio Science SARU (Devilman Crybaby, The Heike Story, Inu-Oh). Scott Pilgrim vs. The World director Edgar Wright returns as executive director, with Scott Pilgrim author Bryan Lee O’Malley and artist Bendavid Grabinski will serve as executive producers, writers, and showrunners. The plot of the graphic novels/movie centers on slacker musician Scott Pilgrim battling the seven evil exes of his new girlfriend, Ramona Flowers. 


The primary actors from the live-action film are higlighted in the trailer above, which include:
Michael Cera - Scott Pilgrim
Mary Elizabeth Winstead - Ramona Flowers
Kieran Culkin - Wallace Wells
Satya Bhabha - Matthew Patel
Chris Evans - Lucas Lee
Anna Kendrick - Stacey Pilgrim
Brie Larson - Envy Adams
Alison Pill - Kim Pine
Aubrey Plaza - Julie Powers
Brandon Routh - Todd Ingram
Jason Schwartzman - Gideon Graves
Johnny Simmons - Young Neil
Mark Webber - Stephen Stills
Mae Whitman - Roxie Richter
Ellen Wong - Knives Chau
Unfortunatley, the series currently still doesn’t have a release window other than “coming soon.” Scott Pilgrim has always had a strong relationship with video games; the graphic novels and film incorporate a bevy of gaming references. Of course, we’d be remiss, not to mention the much-beloved 2010 beat ‘em up Scott Pilgrim vs. The World: The Game, which was remastered for modern consoles in 2021. 
Are you excited to see Scott Pilgrim return as an anime? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

Sure, in reality, I’m slumped on my couch in a position that my body will give me payback for when I’m thirty, but in my fantasy, I’m a musical prodigy whose guitar licks are so epic it would make Slash cry. My joy for virtual jamming came as a direct result of playing hours and hours of Guitar Hero. Harmonix held my music taste in its death grip, and almost breaking my fingers on those flimsy plastic buttons trying to conquer Through The Fire And Flames is a precious memory of mine.
So yeah, I love a good guitar sesh, so when I saw that Hi-Fi Rush was about a wannabe rockstar that smacks evil megacorp robots with his guitar to a catchy rock OST, Tango Gameworks had my attention.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Live A Live became one of our favorite RPGs when it launched on Switch last year, and the celebrated remake is making the jump to PlayStation consoles and Steam on April 27. 
Additionally, there’s a free demo on PlayStation available today that lets you play three of the game’s eight stories. Live A Live was originally released in 1994 for the Super Famicom in Japan, but it hadn’t been localized for the West for decades. Directed by Takashi Tokita, one of the lead creative minds behind Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy IV, the game consists of eight very different short stories, each starring its own protagonist and featuring distinct gameplay mechanics and presentations. While the battle system is turn-based strategy, sometimes the game flips that on its head in unique ways.
Last year, Square Enix resurrected the title by giving it an Octopath Traveler-style HD-2D facelift, a rearranged soundtrack, and full voice-acting. You can pre-order the game on PlayStation and Steam to get a 20% discount. To learn more, you can read our review of Live A Live here.]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-03-30T13:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A short animated sequence kicks The Last Worker into gear, reeling off the game’s backstory with breezy efficiency. It’s an apt start for this first-person satire set in a fully-automated dystopia, in that it underlines a very human aptitude for artistic communication. It’s surprising, then, that as The Last Worker continues its story, it takes less graceful turns, electing for verbosity over economy. For a game that takes critical aim at the future of work, frankly, it’s all a bit laboured.
So what does happen in that opening animation? First, we see everyman hero Kurt among thousands of recruits arriving at the gigantic distribution centre of megacorp Jüngle (like Amazon, get it?), to spend their working lives plucking products off shelves to order. Before long, though, any drop in output sees the employees themselves plucked off and given the boot, to be replaced by robots. As the numbers dwindle, top-performer Kurt remains steadfast, and even finds love among the boxes with a fellow product picker. But when she gets pregnant and quits, he stays behind, living full-time in the warehouse. Years pass. Jüngle smothers the entire retail market, and Kurt becomes, well, the last worker.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alt.Ctrl.GDC is a regular fixture at the Game Developers Conference, and this year I spotted some properly incredible creations from its largely student-led group of exhibitors. There was a big focus on co-op games and time trial demos in this year's cohort, with nearly every stand having some sort of whiteboard pinned up that was constantly being scrubbed out with new fastest lap times and corresponding visitor names. There was also lots of friendly hooting emanating from them as well, as mates and strangers attempted to co-ordinate their gaggles of limbs to steer various game characters in the right direction. 
It was excellent fun, and I sampled a bunch of games that used toasters, intricate pulley systems, papier-mache tree stumps, bike wheels and more in place of your typical controllers and mice and keyboard. There were also plenty more I didn't get to try out, mainly due to time, and you can see the full list over on GDC's website. For now, though, here are some personal highlights of what I saw, including the largest bowler hat I think I've ever seen in my life.

Not a fan of trapping said friends into small balls, only letting them out to fight gangs and other Godlike creatures? Well, Cassette Beasts might be the game for you. It's a Pokémon-like where you’ll still be beating up wildlife creatures in turn-based combat, but rather than capturing them, you record their likeness on the titular tapes and then transform into those same street cone-wearing crabs and metal-clad wolves. It looks like an energetic, nostalgic romp, and it’s coming to PC and Game Pass on April 26th.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Forspoken may not have set the world on fire, but those who enjoyed it have a new reason to revisit the world of Athia. Square Enix has announced a new story expansion called In Tanta We Trust, and it takes place decades before the campaign begins.
The story sees Frey Holland follow a mysterious voice that leads to her being sent back in time 25 years before she first stepped foot in Athia. She arrives at the Purge of Rheddig, the battle that caused Athia’s collapse and pushed the Tantas to madness. Frey must now fight to save this era of Athia, and she has backup in the form of Tanta Cinta. Frey gains new magical powers, including tag-team-focused abilities that utilize Tanta Cinta’s talents. The DLC also features new environments for players to scale using Frey’s parkour skills. 
Forspoken: In Tanta We Trust is a paid expansion that launches on May 26. Those who purchased the Digital Deluxe Edition of the game can play it three days early, on May 23. For more on Forspoken, you can read our review here. You can also check out this story on how Square Enix recently absorbed developer Luminous Productions.]]></summary>

It's been more than eight years since Tekken 7 arrived in arcades across the globe. While the console version didn't hit for another two years, the gap since that seventh entry represents the largest distance between two mainline entries since the series began in 1994. Bandai Namco used that time to evolve the experience, adding several new characters by way of DLC en route to the announcement of a highly anticipated eighth entry.
With so much time since Tekken 7 launched, Tekken 8 represents not only the franchise's first game developed for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, but als…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this month, developer Deck 13 revealed that its upcoming action RPG, Atlas Fallen, would arrive May. Now today, less than a month later, Deck 13 has announced that the game has been delayed to August. 
More specifically, Atlas Fallen will now hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on August 10. This news comes after previewers recently went hands-on with the game as part of a press event and after the game was showcased at PAX East, which took place last week. As for why Deck 13 is delaying Atlas Fallen, the team says it needs more time with the game. 
Hey people, we have some important news! pic.twitter.com/W2YKNk3xfU

Deck 13 also revealed that this delay will allow the team to include a full German voiceover for Atlas Fallen.

But less romantically, the title evokes Internet Explorer or Acrobat Reader - sitting comfortably alongside the clearly and sensibly labelled Windows software of the mid-90s. It’s a reminder of just how early Westwood happened upon the blueprint for real-time strategy, right as many PC users were buying their first trackball mice.

Back then, the developer was fresh from Dune II, its unlikely David Lynch adaptation and progenitor of the RTS genre as we know it today. Inspired by the house politics and struggle for resources that consumed the desert planet Arrakis, Westwood had come up with an addictive formula for harvesting spice and converting that wealth into military power, which in turn could be used in the battle to secure more spice. The team was, quite frankly, surprised by how much fun that formula had turned out to be.

Now she finds herself locked in a weird study in a poorly lit mansion, with only a stranger on the end of a walkie-talkie for company.

It is, like its developer's previous game Kerbal Space Program, about building a machine designed to fly, crashing it back to earth, then constructing something better. 

Now its developer has announced they're doing something similar with the game itself. Balsa Model Flight Sim will relaunch later this year with a new name, Kitbash Model Club, a more ambitious physics construction sandbox, and a plan to release as a complete game rather than into early access. Existing owners of Balsa Model Flight Simulator will get Kitbash Model Club for free.

On the other hand, it also adds cosmetics - both those that can be unlocked for free and via spending real money.

It’s fully launching this summer, and Valve have been holding a limited access test since the pseudo-sequel's announcement. They’ve been inviting select players based on factors that are important to the dev team, such as trust factor, Steam account standing, and recent playtime on Valve servers. But last night, Valve shook their finger like a stern parent, informing fans that playing more Counter-Strike: Global Offensive wouldn’t get them into the CS2 test any faster.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new character trailer for Tekken 8 showcases the action of the returning Jun Kazama. Jin’s long-lost mother is making her first playable appearance in a mainline entry since Tekken 2, and based on a new gameplay trailer, she hasn’t lost a step.
A gameplay trailer shows off Jun’s expert use of Kazama-style martial arts to cleanse opponents of their evils. That translates to beating the snot out of them if that wasn’t obvious. We also see a brief reunion between Jun and her former lover, Kazuya, and it goes about as well as you would expect from a mother meeting the father and repeat attempted killer of their son. 


For those keeping count, here’s the list of confirmed fighters thus far:
Jack-8
Jin Kazama
Kazuya Mishima
King
Lars Alexandersson
Marshall Law
Nina Williams
Paul Phoenix

Had he not died in 1894, he might’ve said the same thing about the Logitech G502 Hero showing up in Amazon sales events, although maybe it wouldn’t have sounded as profound.


That’s right, the G502 Hero – beloved by RPS readers, a longtime resident in our best gaming mouse list, and precursor to an inferior new model – is once again going cheap. A predictable development, albeit an entirely welcome one. This time it’s in the Amazon Spring Sale, with a better-than-half-price discount bringing it down to £35.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was trying to explain the vibe of Crime Boss: Rockay City - a new Payday-like whose main USP is it's full of aging 90s-era-ish stars whose unifying trait is that they should not have been hired to do voice work for this game - to Graham as I was playing over the weekend. "You know how police procedurals all have at least one episode that's about gamers, so they have to make up a game for it? This feels like that. It's like a fake game made up by a Hollywood television  producer."
A few hours later, after numerous short cutscenes in which Michael Rooker has to shout nonsensical American Football metaphors every so often, to justify the fact that his character is called Touchdown, and Michael Madsen growls about "candy" in a hard-living 65-year-old's voice coming out of an uncanny-vallyy 35-year-old's face, I text him an update: "It's also like that tweet that goes 'Bames Nond's having a stronk, call a bondulance'."

For the uninitiated, Tax Heaven 3000 is the anime dating sim that claims to do your taxes and asks you for identifying info such as your email and Social Security Number. It’s likely a joke app, partly because of its waifu Iris (like, the IRS) and partly because it’s from MSCHF, the art collective behind Lil Nas X’s Satan Shoes and other viral drops.

The Legend of Zelda series producer, Eiji Aonuma, revealed this during today's Tears of the Kingdom gameplay showcase. He then jumped directly into the game, showing off more than 10 minutes of new gameplay. Aonuma begins this demonstration by showing how Link can get up to the Sky Islands floating above Hyrule. He uses the "Recall" power, which rewinds an object's movement, to reverse a fallen rock's descent. He's able to reach one of the floating sky islands using this new power. 
After fighting an enemy up here, we learn that weapon durability, a hotly debated feature of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, is back. But now, you can use Link's new "Fuse" ability to create brand-new weapons. Aonuma showed us ho…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As is so often the case in systemic turn-based tactics games, things started to go wrong in my preview session for The Lamplighters League when a nearby torch met a cunningly placed oil slick and erupted into flames. A load of enemies were instantly enveloped in its hot sea of death, as intended, but one of our heroes - the tank-like bruiser Fedir - also ended up getting burned by mistake. As an ex-mob enforcer, he's certainly built to take a few punches, and his abilities are all focused on making him the centre of attention, his attacks growing more powerful as his rage levels continue to grow. "You want him to get attacked," game director Chris Rogers tells me, calling on the phrase 'you wouldn't like him when he's angry' as the basis for Fedir's ability set. But with that extra fire damage he receives, it's just a little too much all at once. He gets knocked down, and the tide of battle quickly goes south.
In truth, I played no part in this downfall. Rogers was in the control cockpit for this one, showing me exactly how Harebrained Schemes' latest game actually works. It's quite a different proposition from their last game, Battletech, and in this quite literal trial by fire, studio head and co-founder Mitch Gitelman actually pulled a dollar out of his pocket at one point and put a bet on whether Rogers would make it out alive. He certainly had his work cut out for him. Rogers won that dollar, and here's how the game's emphasis on deep, customisable character builds set him up for success.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[E3 2023 has taken another hit, as Ubisoft has confirmed it will not have a presence at the show. In a statement to Video Games Chronicle, the publisher reveals that it will instead hold its own live presentation on June 12 in Los Angeles. 
The publisher statement to VGC reads “While we initially intended to have an official E3 presence, we’ve made the subsequent decision to move in a different direction, and will be holding a Ubisoft Forward Live event on 12th June in Los Angeles. We look forward to sharing more details with our players very soon.”
Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot stated in February that the company would commit to attending “if E3 happens”. If that's the case, this news certainly doesn’t bode well for the fate of what’s supposed to be E3’s big return. 
As for what Ubisoft could show at its event, Assassin’s Creed Mirage, The Crew Motorfest, and (maybe) Skull and Bones are slated to release this year. Other announced projects include the long-quiet Splinter Cell and Prince of Persia remakes, a multitude of new Assassin’s Creed games, and Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora. A rumored follow-up to Immortals Fenyx Rising could also make an appearance.  
Ubisoft joins Nintendo on the list of major publishers that have declined to participate in this year’s show, following a previous report that Microsoft and Sony plan to follow suit. E3 is largely organized by ReedPop this year and will take place June 13-16 at the Los Angeles Convention Center. The event will open its doors to fans and press, with separate attendance days for each. It will be the first in-person event since 2019.

The game’s online modes will later become unplayable as developer Player First Games plans for a relaunch early next year. 
In a developer blog post, Player First Games CEO Tony Huynh explains that since MultiVersus launched in open beta (yes, open beta) last July, players have offered a ton of feedback. The studio feels that the only way to properly implement improvements based on these fan requests is to shut the game down temporarily. Huynh writes,

It was a special edition that came with a code for Wind Waker HD and a gamepad emblazoned with a golden Triforce. For my brother and I, 11 and 13 at the time, respectively, this was a massive deal; we’d spent the last year seeing Wii Us at friends’ houses, yearning for our own, and struggling to explain the difference between it and our current Wii to our parents.
But while it was valuable to us, the Wii U struggled to sell and has ultimately gone down as one of Nintendo’s most disappointing consoles. Today, the system’s eShop shuts down forever, permanently closing a chapter of Nintendo’s history.
I’ll be the first to admit that the rosy lenses of nostalgia heavily tint my memory of the Wii U. It was a formative time in my …]]></summary>

That is to say I have none at all, and that any time spent dancing turns me into an uncontrollable set of limbs flailing in the wrong directions. Think Octodad in a night club and you’d be on the right track (although the disastrous limb flailing is enough to keep me out of the clubs).
That lack of rhythm isn’t just native to the dance floor of an awkward family party, though. Even nuzzled into my chair with a controller in hand, I simply can’t stick to the beat. My eyes glued to notes floating across the screen, trying to hit them at just the right time, you’d probably see Time hiding in a corner to my left, giggling at my repeated failure. A barrage of borked bleeps and bungled notes tend to leave me with spirits sunk.
In Hi-Fi Rush, though, I always leave with my head held high.

I'd flirted with the idea for years, but it was the release of BioShock Infinite that finally convinced me to take the plunge. And I can't exactly complain: the series' Rapture arc — made up of the first and second games, plus the prequel novel by none other than John "The Crow" Shirley — now makes up maybe 10% of my personality, having given me two of my favourite video games, my favourite video game tie-in book, and a front-running contender for my favourite video game locale all at once.
I just wish that, after all that prep I did for it, I'd actually liked BioShock Infinite a bit more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It has been said (by me) that a lot of games journalists are generalists in terms of what we play, especially if we're talking about people who are staffers at an outlet, or have ever worked in guides. Though we all have stuff we prefer, or series that we serve as the go-to expert on for in-house needs (I think vid bud Liam might actually walk around wearing an ASK ME ABOUT RESIDENT EVIL badge in his day-to-day life), we - unlike the blue-haired neo-Gods of streaming - often can't focus on one game all of the time. You have to know enough about enough to be able to write about enough.
There are, however, a bunch of big important games that I haven't played. Sometimes it's because a bunch of other people have, so that gap in the site's knowledge is already plugged (and I do always make sure to be aware of their impact and basic facts). Other times, they might be games that I'm not really interested in playing, either because they're not my genre or they seem too overwrought. Or, in some cases, it's because everyone says they're really good and I have to try them, though I've been burned before on this method (you people said the same about Ready Player One). But you know what would make me take in info about these games, even if it's just by osmosis? If they all got PowerWash Sim DLCs.

You replace pollution with lush life across a series of four randomly generated dioramas (plus four slightly more complicated challenge levels), covering the landscape in fynbos and forests, lichen and lagoons. When it all comes together and you can look over the fruits of your labour, birds chirping and piano melodically playing in the background, it’s beautiful. Getting to that point, though, is an often repetitive experience marred with frustration.

Despite the fact that we've gotten multiple trailers over the past few months, Nintendo has yet to reveal any clip of gameplay longer than a few seconds, and every new glimpse seems to raise more questions than it answers. What are those strange vehicles? Does Link have a new paraglider? And why does the game cost $70? Whether or not tomorrow's showcase addresses those questions, we'll all find out when Tears of the Kingdom releases on May 12.
We'll be live streaming our reactions to the 10 minutes showcase on Game Informer's Twitch channel.]]></summary>

After finishing up work on two successful mobile games around four years ago, Humble was itching for something new. But he wasn't quite sure what. "I was in the kitchen talking to my son about, 'Oh, what should I do? I don't know what opportunities there are,' and he was like, 'Why don't you just pick the company you want to work at and ask them?'" And as a life-long Crusader Kings player, the answer was clear. "Okay!?" Humble says incredulously. "I can do that, I guess. So I did. I wrote to [PR manager] Troy [Goodfellow], and he knew Fred [Wester, CEO], and that was it. It was two weeks later and I met him in San Francisco and said, hey, I'd like to start a studio, and here's the way I'd like to run it. And he was like, sure, let's go for it."
So began Humble's journey to creating Life By You, his upcoming life simulator that's set to give his former pet project, The Sims, a run for its money. With The Sims 5, or Project Rene as it's currently known, still some way off, Life By You seems poised to finally give life sim fans the game they've always wanted. "I wanted to make an open world life simulator where the core tenant was freedom," says Humble. "Where players could freely play and tell their stories with minimal friction." And what was standing in the way of that freedom? Loading screens, says Humble.

The Great War Colon Western Front is about taking the Triple Alliance or Entente through the hell years of 1914-18, or beyond. It's a purely military game about overcoming massed defences through attrition, both in localised real-time battles, and a turn-based strategic map. It's perhaps unfair to criticise it for repetition and some intermittent sense of futility, since a First World War game without them would defeat the point. But I still feel a little mixed.

The mention of “Left4Dead3” was recently spotted in CS2’s files (thanks, Reddit) which sparked online speculation for a third game in the series. The files state that the “severity” is “high”, the “version” is “2”, but what about the “priority?” Bad news for fans of the run-and-gunning zombie shooter: according to the files, the priority is “none.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Počet DDoS útoků na české firmy v únoru sice klesl, zvýšila se ale intenzita jednotlivých útoků. Po několika měsících se totiž opět objevily útoky s intenzitou vyšší než 150 Gbps. U průměrného útoku je přitom tato hodnota přibližně desetkrát menší. Zároveň již druhý měsíc po sobě nejvíce útoků míří z Ruska. Stále pak platí trend, že útočníci napadající servery provozující služby či internetové stránky více hledají úplně nové cesty svých DDoS útoků a prodlužují dobu jejich trvání.]]></summary>

Even better, imagine if those moves were pulled off through timing based minigames that resembled the battles found in Nintendo's excellent (and underrated) Mario & Luigi RPG series. Sounds good, right? Well guess what, that game exists! It's called Wrestle Story and it's definitely a project to keep an eye on.


After spending twenty glorious minutes with its colourful demo at PAX East, I was keen to chat to creative director Steve Jimenez about the team's inspirations, the challenges of translating wrestling into a turn-based RPG and the  exciting locations that players will attempt to liberate from a group of devious heels.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier in the week, Liam and I had the opportunity to chat with Animal Well's solo developer and publisher Bigmode about creating their eerie subterranean world. We then had a chance to go hands on with the PAX East demo, and wow, we were both incredibly impressed. Watch the video below for our enthusiastic impressions:
If we could give an RPS 'Bestest Best in show' award to a game, is would be Animal Well. Liam and I loved the game's dense atmosphere, spider-web of interconnected caverns, and creepy creatures that lurk in the dark. We also loves the effects the game has, which reminded Liam of Octopath Traveler's visual flairs. If I had to compare it to one game, it would be Hollow Knight, which is very exciting.
We have plenty more PAX East indies for you to check out so make sure you have a peruse through our RPS@PAX tag. A couple of our favourites have been chaotic rouguelite Pizza Possum, Resident Evil-like Alone In The Dark, and island exploration game Mythwrecked.

I played Pizza Possum on the first day of PAX and knew it would make a great indie highlight for our time here at PAX East. Liam and I have now both played the demo and you can listen to our impressions in the video below:
What really appealed to us about Pizza Possum is how chaotic it is. It's like Untitled Goose Game but at double the speed. Playing the eponymous possum, you need you scamper around a sunny Mediterranean town scoffing as much food as you can get your grubby mitts on.
There's an element of hide-and-seek too, as there are patrol dogs who will try and stop your food eating rampage, but you can quickly jump into a berry bush to thorw them off your scent. It's goofy fun, and we're completeley smitten with it.

Watch below to learn about how the developers created their zero to hero story, how they're addressing myths and persaonl issues in the world of pro wresting, as well as sharing a story about how one of the team got their nose broken in a wrestling accident during development.
My main take away from the interview is how much of the RPG incorporates all aspects of Wrestling, not just the ring fights we see on TV. Another interesting thing is that Mega Cat reached out to a handful of real-life wrestlers to ask their permission to use their likeness in the game - not an easy feat to secure, I'm sure.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've played a bunch of indie game demos at PAX East, but none left my head reeling as much as 43 Studios' fiendishly frantic action platfotmer Hell Of An Office. It's a super fast parkour adventure in the vein of Neon White, and after ten minutes with the demo my heart race was through the roof. If I owned a fitbit it would have been screaming at me to have a nice sit down with a cuppa. Check out my full impressions in the video below:
Hell Of An Office puts your platforming reflexes to the test as you're tasked with sprinting ad jumping your way straight outta hell. With only a stapler as your means of survival, you need to navigate through each level before it slowly sinks into the burning lava. React quickly, or fall victim to Hell's scorching pools.
If you love the blood-pumping, sweaty palm inducing action-platforming of Neon White, make sure to keep an eye on Hell Of An Office as it makes it's way through Early Access.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I really enjoyed dark fantasy adventure Roki when it first released back in 2020, and keen to see what developers Polygon Treehouse have gotten up to since, I jumped at the opportunity to play the PAX East demo for Mythwrecked: Ambrosia Island. You can watch my impressions of the demo in the video below:
In Mythwrecked you play as Alex, a backpacker who has washed up on the sun-drenched shores of Ambrosia Island. As she begins exploring, she soon realises that this island seems to be a hot spot for the gods from ancient Greek myths. Your task is to befriend each god, help them restore their memories, and find a way back to civilisation.
From playing the demo, you can see much of what made Roki fun reflected in Mythwrecked. The environments are interesting to poke around in, puzzles are breezy brain ticklers, and it has Polygon Treehouse's sense of humour. Each Greek god has a humerous twist on their lore,  and during the demo I had a fun time chatting with Hermes, who is dressed in nothing more than a pair of skimpy white speedos and a matching white sweat band - a bold choice of attire.

It's a 2D metriodvania where you play as a little blob trying to navigate a subtterranean labyrinth filled with creatures - some cute, some not so cute. 
To find out more about this strange puzzle platformer's beginnings and development, we spoke to solo develeoper Billy Basso and Bigmode's Leah Gastrow which you can view in the two videos below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Join us for another PAX East game highlight straight from the show floor, and this time we decided to revisit a cult horror classic: Alone In The Dark. This psychological horror is being developed by Pieces Interactive with publishing backing from THQ Nordic and is a love letter to the original game released back in the 90s.
As someone who had played the original, and RPS' Resident Evil uber fan, Liam decided to check out the demo and you can hear his impressions in the video below:
According to the devs at the THQ booth, this demo is a stand-alone prequel story that will not be in the final game, but shares the same eerie atmosphere and action that'll be in the main game. This reimagining is set in the Gothic American south and in the main game you'll be playing as Edward Carnby or Emily Hartwood as they navigate the monster infested Derceto Manor, the same mansion featured in the demo.

I had the chance to sit down with the demo and play KO_OP's teen dino adventure first hand. Check out the video below if you're interested to know what I thought:
Goodbye Volcano High follows a group of teen dinos as they begin their senior year of highschool. It's part coming-of-age visual novel part rhythm game as the group try to grapple with school while also trying to make it big as up-and-coming musicians.
I had a great time with the demo, and it looks like we won't have to wait long for the full release at Goodbye Volcano High is launching on Steam and PlayStation on June 15th.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's almost become an RPS tradition to search the show floor at PAX events and find the coolest stuff and highlight it in a video, so that's exactly what we've done at PAX East. There's a lot of cool booths, fun props, and generally weird stuff to see, so we've chosen our absolute favourites and have listed them in video form for your viewing pleasure.
Everything at PAX East is situated in one massive hall (instead of PAX West's multiple floors, rooms, and buildings) so it's nice and easy to see everything in one or two loops. It doesn't feel cramped at all, even with Friday's busy crowds, and the booths are as spectacular as ever.
Some of our favourites included Devolver Digital's movie theatre-inspired booth, which has the new addition of a candle-lit shrine for Cult Of The Lamb's upcoming free expansion Relics Of The Old Faith. We also loved Ysbryd Games' Demonschool booth which had a school desk layout and cool retro TV. Another favourite was the animated robot dinosaur (complete with rideable saddle) that we found at the Roots Of Pacha demo builds.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of Sea of Star’s most compelling selling points is the involvement of Chrono Trigger composer Yasunori Mitsuda. To know that a game heavily inspired by Chrono Trigger will feature music from the man behind its score is exciting. Still, it is worth being excited for the soundtrack that Mitsuda will not be directly involved with, as well.
The majority of Sea of Stars’ soundtrack is in the hands of the talented Eric W. Brown, who also composed the soundtrack for The Messenger. Brown’s musical history started with playing drums in metal bands. “I've been a drummer since I was a kid and I'm still a drummer now, but, you know, I got into music production via chiptune essentially,” Brown says.  Around 2006 he decided to focus on making music on his own in the chiptune genre, primarily on Game…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[“Imagine someone saying ‘We need you to make a trailer for our movie, but we've only got half of the sets and props ready…” says Tim Bevan de Lange, Creative Director at Realtime Nordic, a studio that makes, specifically, video game trailers. “...and we haven’t actually shot anything, so you’ll need to do that yourself. Some of the actors won't come out of their trailers. One of them will but if you shoot him from the front you realise he's got no eyes, but don't show the audience that. It's not intentional, he's getting them fixed. Also can you film it twice, for different streaming platforms? Make a really good version for Netflix and a slightly worse looking one for Quibi.”


Every so often a game trailer comes along that makes me think, hang on, that was bloody brilliant! I bet some people made that! Most recently it was Creative Assembly’s Immortal Empires trailer. Well, I’ve been digging around and I’m happy to report that yes, although I’m the first one to just see a trailer as an algorithm trying to snatch my coin purse away like a manure-encrusted Victorian ne’er-do-well, game trailers are made by humans. They're often humans who do it as as specific job, either in-house at a developer or as an outside agency like Realtime Nordic. Enlightened and enthralled, I asked some of them about what went into the strange space that is making the trailers for your favourite games.

It's partly the tone: a compelling blend of gothic and biomechanical horror, with a 90s game boy goriness that's cartoony enough to feel colourful rather than repulsive. "Camp" isn't the right word, but a hint of melodrama gives the story severity without self-seriousness. I mean, within the first minute of the game, your soldier goes from a terrified Normandy-style amphibious assault on a fortified metal church to seeing their war made irrelevant when the moon explodes. The whole thing is kind of metal, to be honest.

It’s also nerfing cat food, since it was overpowered and, well, are there actually any cats in the game?

Ghost Ship had planned to remove Legacy today - March 23rd - but after fan feedback, they’ve decided to keep Legacy edition around indefinitely.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A video game based on the hit Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles graphic novel The Last Ronin is in the works, Polygon reports.
The news comes from Polygon's interview with Doug Rosen, senior vice president for games and emerging media at Paramount Global. According to Rosen, The Last Ronin video game will be a single-player action role-playing title in the vein of the Norse-themed God of War series. Like the story it adapts, the game will feature a mature tone. The game’s developer has not been named, and the project is years away from release. 
The Last Ronin was published in 2020 as a five-issue mini-series by IDW. It takes place in a dark futuristic New York, where three of the four turtles have been killed. The surviving turtle, whose identity is revealed at the end of the first issue (we won’t spoil it), dons a black mask and seeks revenge by fighting crime using both his and the weapons of his fallen brothers. 
It’s a cool (and very grim) story if you haven’t read it, and we’re excited to see it translated into a game. Rosen also mentions in the same interview that Paramount sees opportunities to create different types of TMNT games that target young and adult audiences. 
The Turtles are enjoying quite the renaissance lately thanks to the launch of the well-received beat ‘em up Shredder’s Revenge last year, the nostalgia trip of the Cowabunga Collection, a Shredder-themed Call of Duty pack, and even a new animated film coming to theaters this August.

In 2021, however, it was delayed to 2022. In May of last year, Daedalic revealed Gollum would release in September but then, in July, announced it had been delayed once more. Now, today, Daedalic has revealed that Gollum will finally be released this May. 
More specifically, Gollum will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on May 25. There will be a Switch version of the game, but Daedalic says it's planned for later this year. Alongside today's news, Daedalic has released a new story trailer. Check it out below: 


"The Lord of the Rings: Gollum is a story-driven action adventure," a press release reads. "Embark on a perilous journey as Gollum, chasing the only thing that is precious to you. Climb, leap, and sneak your way past dangers or into advantageous spots. Gollum is skillful and sly, and torn by a split personality. It is up to you to decide whether to yield to the darker side of Gollum or trust the kinder gentler hint of Sméagol." 
Check out some new screenshots from the game below:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last year, Sonic Origins celebrated Sonic the Hedgehog's birthday by gathering Sonic the Hedgehog, Sonic the Hedgehog 2, Sonic 3 & Knuckles, and Sonic CD in one place with new features and some added bonuses. Despite some shortcomings, the compilation remains the best official way to experience those classic games from Genesis and Sega CD three decades following their original releases. Today, Sega announced the bundle is about to get better through Sonic Origins Plus, a premium upgrade that arrives a year after the collection's initial launch.
Sonic Origins Plus brings forward all the features of Sonic Origins delivered last year – Classic Mode, Anniversary Mode, widescreen support, added story animations, a virtual museum, and more – while adding a bunch of new content. First up, Sonic Origins Plus adds all 12 Sonic Game Gear games to the museum.
The full list of Game Gear games getting added is listed below.
Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine
Sonic Blast
Sonic Chaos
Sonic Drift
Sonic Drift 2
Sonic Labyrinth
Sonic Spinball
Sonic the Hedgehog
Sonic the Hedgehog 2
Sonic the Hedgehog Triple Trouble
Tails Adventure
Tails' Sky Patrol
On top of that, Amy joins the roster of playable characters in the Genesis and Sega CD titles (Sonic 1, Sonic 2, Sonic 3 & Knuckles, and Sonic CD). One of the strangest exclusions in the original Sonic Origins release is also rectified, as Knuckles will become playable in Sonic CD. Sadly, this first press release does not make any mention of restoring the replaced music in Sonic the Hedgehog 3.


Sonic Origins Plus arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on June 23. If you don't already own the initial release of Sonic Origins, the digital version of Sonic Origins Plus costs $40. The physical version, which includes a 20-page artbook and reversible coversheet with new art, also costs $40. If you already own Sonic Origins, you can upgrade to Plus for $10.

The real-time tactical shooter pits a squad of marines against dozens of deadly xenomorphs, though we hadn't seen any gameplay footage until the release of a new video today.
A gameplay commentary video walks players through the basics, in which players command a team of marines to investigate a xenomorph outbreak on Moon Lethe. You’ll issue commands for teammates to attack or execute skills and can also slow time during firefights to select orders. However, your squadmates can perish permanently, but you can raise your survival odds by outfitting soldiers with various weapons and upgrades to ensure the best team composition.


Aliens: Dark Descent is being devleoped by Tindalos Interactive, makers of the Battlefleet Gothic: Armada series, and will be published by Focus Entertainment. It arrives on June 20 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Atari has announced that it has entered into an agreement to acquire Night Dive Studios, the team behind the upcoming remake of System Shock, for roughly $10 million. 
Night Dive Studios is currently led by Stephen Kick and Larry Kuperman and is both a development studio and a publisher. It has published more than 100 games, and will add its remake of System Shock to that list on May 30 (on PC). Atari says a key to the success of Night Dive Studios is its proprietary KEX engine that makes classic games playable on modern hardware. Considering Atari is a retro company, and one that just acquired 12 classic retro games, it's easy to see what Night Dive Studios can do for it. 


"In addition, Atari, SA also announced that it intends to proceed in the near-term with a €30 million bond issue co…]]></summary>

        <id>120190</id>
        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2023/03/23/redfall-microsoft-canceled-ps5-version-after-bethesda-acquisition-arkane-director-says"/>
        <updated>2023-03-23T12:14:19.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Arkane was developing a PlayStation 5 version of its upcoming first-person vampire shooter, Redfall, before Microsoft acquired Bethesda in 2020. However, following the acquisition, the PS5 version of the game was canceled by Microsoft, according to Arkane director Harvey Smith in an interview with IGN France (translated by IGN). 
Discussing this with IGN France, Smith said, "We got bought by Microsoft and that was a huge sea change. They said, 'No PlayStation 5. Now we're gonna do Game Pass, Xbox and PC.'"


Smith said Arkane didn't mind the decision, even if Redfall was originally meant to release on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC. 
"Support from Game Pass and having to worry about one less platform, one less complexity," Smith told IGN France. "And Game Pass has a ton of people that can play. It could be our biggest game ever because of the 30 million Game Pass [members] or whatever that number is." 
News of this canceled PS5 version of Redfall doesn't come as much of a surprise. When Redfall was revealed during a 2021 Xbox and Bethesda E3 showcase, it was revealed as an Xbox console exclusive. And considering it's par for the course for companies like PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo to keep their first-party releases off of competitor consoles, it's also not surprising Microsoft opted to make Redfall an Xbox exclusive after it acquired Bethesda. 
A spokesperson for Microsoft responded to this story, providing the following statement: 
Redfall hits Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC on May 2. 
For more about the game, watch the latest Redfall story trailer that introduces some of the vampiric big bass and then watch this gameplay trailer that invites you out to a bloody night on the town.

        <updated>2023-03-22T18:51:29.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Publisher CI Games and developer Hexworks have released a new trailer showcasing some of the impressive visual work going into its upcoming Lords of the Fallen sequel, The Lords of the Fallen. 
The Lords of the Fallen, previously known as Lords of the Fallen 2, has had a rocky development history thus far, but with Hexworks taking over development back in 2020, the sequel has begun to shape up.
We got a reveal trailer during Gamescom last year that showcased the game's darker, more gothic tone alongside word that this sequel will feature online co-op and a world five times larger than its predecessor. We got another look at the game's grisly world in a new trailer released during The Game Awards back in December, and now, thanks to Epic's State of Unreal presentation today, we get to see more of the game. 
Because it's a trailer released as part of today's State of Unreal presentation, it's less cinematic than previous trailers and instead, focuses on some of the visual design work going into the game.
Check it out for yourself below in this new trailer for The Lords of the Fallen:  


As you can see, The Lords of the Fallen continues to look great, and fortunately, we don't have to wait too much longer to go hands-on with it because it's due out on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC sometime this year. 
For more information about the game, head to our hub for The Lords of the Fallen and then read our thoughts on its predecessor in Game Informer's Lords of the Fallen review after that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ninja Theory revealed Senua's Saga: Hellblade II during The Game Awards back in 2019 and while that initial trailer impressed us with its dark tone and beautiful visuals, not much else has been released about the game. Since 2019, the Xbox-owned developer has released two instances of behind-the-scenes footage, with one revealing the game is not a direct sequel to 2017's Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice. We did get some gameplay during a trailer at The Game Awards in 2021 but since then, not much. 
Now, thanks to today's State of Unreal presentation highlighting the current state of Epic's Unreal Engine, we get another tease of what's to come in Senua's Saga: Hellblade II; this time, it's a look at the impressive facial animation Ninja Theory has pulled off in the sequel. 
Check out this new Senua's Saga: Hellblade II teaser for yourself below: 


As you can see, Senua's Saga: Hellblade II continues to look impressive. Unfortunately, we still don't know when we'll be playing the game, though. 
In the meantime, read Game Informer's Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice review and then head to our Senua's Saga: Hellblade II hub for more information about this upcoming sequel.

An official release date was not revealed, but Valve says Counter-Strike 2 will be a free upgrade to anyone who owns Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Plus, if you do own Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, you can jump into a limited test for Counter-Strike 2 starting today. During this testing period, Valve says it will "be evaluating a subset of features to shake out any issues before the worldwide release." 
The company also says, "Counter-Strike 2 is the largest technical leap forward in Counter-Strike's history, ensuring new features and updates for years to come."
Alongside today's reveal, Valve has released three gameplay videos for Counter-Strike 2. You can check out all three below: 






Counter-Strike 2 will run in the Source 2 engine, which has tools and rendering features "available for community map makers to make it easier to build, experiment, and iterate." There will be a Source 2 Item Workshop as well, and it will be available at a later time during the Counter-Strike 2 limited test. 
The official Counter-Strike 2 has plenty of more nitty-gritty details about the game so head there if you want more information. 
Here are some quick-hit highlights players can expect in Counter-Strike 2: 
Upgraded and overhauled maps
Game-changing dynamic smoke grenades
Tick-rate-independent gameplay
Residgned visual effects and audio
All of a player's CS:GO items with them in CS2
Counter-Strike 2 hits PC sometime this summer.

News on Marvel's Spider-Man 2, the highly anticipated follow-up to Insomniac Games' Marvel's Spider-Man from 2018 and 2020's Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales, has been light since the game's reveal in 2021. But back in December, PlayStation did reveal that Marvel's Spider-Man 2 would be out sometime this Fall.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few months ago, Netflix announced it was partnering with Gears of War developer The Coalition to bring a film and TV project to the streaming service. Today, the company announced the writer on the film project will be John Spaihts, known most recently for his work on Dune and Doctor Strange. In a press release, Spaihts had the following to say about the project:
 In the same press release, The Coalition called Spaihts "a master storyteller." The Gears of War developer will also be attached to this project as a producer. You can see their tweet about the announcement below.

@jonspaihts - a talented writer and fellow Gears fan - to adapt an authentic live action Gears of War film with @netflix. https://t.co/OQ3HtpiJkB
March 21, 2023
We still have no release window for the project, and given that they've only just attached a writer, it's probably still a few years out. While many are likely excited at the prospect of this movie's existence, there is perhaps nobody more eager to be in on the production details than Dave Bautista. The Guardians of the Galaxy star has been campaigning for years to be cast as the live-action version of Marcus Fenix, and was even available as a playable skin in a post-launch update to Gears 5.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Activision has revealed that Crash Team Rumble, the 4v4 competitive multiplayer game revealed at The Game Awards last year, will be released this June. 
More specifically, Crash Team Rumble hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One on June 20, as reported by Video Games Chronicle. Activision has also revealed that a closed beta will take place from April 20 through April 24 and anyone who preorders the game will get access to it. This beta will feature Crash Bandicoot, Coco Bandicoot, Tawna Bandicoot, Doctor Neo Cortex, and Dingodile. 


The game will cost $29.99 but a deluxe edition for $39.99 will also be available. Crash Team Rumble will also include a battle pass and both editions include the first season's pass. The deluxe edition will also include the Season 2 battle pass, a free 25-tier boost for Season 1, and the digital proto pack, which brings "Blocky" skins to the game alongside some equippable items, according to VGC. 
Previews released today mention three different roles in Crash Team Rumble: Booster, Blocker, and Scorer. Using these three roles in a MOBA-like fashion, players will need to collect as much Wumpa Fruit as possible and bring it to their zone. If you've played 2021's Pokemon Unite, you probably get the gist here. 

Crash Team Rumble will feature crossplay. It is being developed by Toys for Bob, the team that developed the Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy collection and Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time. 
While waiting for Crash Team Rumble to release in June, read Game Informer's Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy review and then read our review of Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time. 
Crash Team Rumble hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One on June 20.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cal Kestis’ desperate fight against the Empire is the centerpiece of Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, and a new story trailer provides a peek into his struggle as well as the allies, old and new, helping him. 
The trailer provides glimpses of Cal’s friends and crewmates Ceres Junda, Greez Dritus, and Merrin, all sporting five years' worth of age, strife, and hair (or lack thereoff). We also get a look at a new partner, the mercenary Bode Akuna. Some fresh gameplay clips are sprinkled in, too, as we see the now grizzled Cal duel stormstroopers, bounty hunters, and droids. 


Star Wars Jedi: Survivor launches on April 28 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. To learn more, check out this story about how the director hopes to turn the series into a trilogy and our interview with star Cameron Monaghan.]]></summary>

Now that we're three months into the calendar, Sonic Team is ready to release the first of the three updates this week. 
This first content release of 2023 is called "Sights, Sounds, and Speed" and adds content across three areas of the game. First up, new challenge modes, which can be accessed after you complete the main story campaign, give you access to Cyber Space Challenge and Battle Rush via the title screen.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From Software celebrated the one-year anniversary of Elden Ring last month and now, publisher Bandai Namco has released some fun statistics covering what players have done in 365 days of Elden Ring. 
Starting with the least surprising statistic, players have attempted to defeat Malenia, Blade of Miquella, a colossal 329 million times. In second place, players have attempted to beat Margit the Fell Omen 281 million times. In third, Limgrave Tree Sentinel 277 million times, Radagon of the Golden Order in fourth at 148 million, and in fifth, Starscourge Radahn at 139 million. Across all bosses in Elden Ring, players have initiated 5.9 billion attempts. 
If you enjoyed those stats, there are all kinds of other ones in the infographic below – enjoy!

For more about the game, read Game Informer's Elden Ring review to find out why we gave it a 10 out of 10, and then read about the game's DLC expansion, Shadow of the Erdtree.
