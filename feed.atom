        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[RedDeer.Games has announced they’re handling the console publishing of MGP Studios and Solid9 Studios’ Project Downfall, a neon-drenched first-person shooter with shades of Hotline Miami. It’s coming to Switch in November, followed by Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S sometime later. Sorry, PlayStation fans.


Project Downfall is a psychedelic shooter that leans heavily on Hotline Miami while transplanting its gameplay to a first-person perspective. It’s heavily about slow-motion takedowns of groups of enemies, swapping weapons frequently, and throwing the ones you’re finished using to buy yourself some time. Your character is a wealthy businessman with a chip on their shoulder and a thirst for blood. There’s actually a plot buried beneath all the action involving global politics, but I’m fairly certain the protagonist cares little about that and just wants to perforate thugs.




I played Project Downfall this past January but only got through about an hour-and-a-half with it. I remember parting with it on bad terms, but for the life of me, I can’t remember why. I recall being a bit perturbed by how similar the narrative was to Hotline Miami, but I think I had an issue with the gameplay, as well. I just don’t remember what specifically.


If you do manage to make it through, there are 12 different endings for you to get depending on the choices you make throughout the game. Weirdly, the one new feature they tout for the console version is “a completely redesigned lighting system for Nintendo Switch.” Woo!


Project Downfall is currently available for PC. The Switch version will be released in November followed by Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S sometime after that.

And after just six weeks on the market, Starfield is already the seventh best-selling game of the year. February's Hogwarts Legacy remains in the top spot. 
Starfield hit Xbox and PC on September 6 and while its Xbox Game Pass release surely helped it become the biggest launch ever for a Bethesda game with more than 6 million players, Circana's data tracks dollar sales. This means Starfield was the best-selling game of September despite Xbox Game Pass. Circana executive director Mat Piscatella says on Twitter that, "Starfield ranked as the best-s…]]></summary>

The two parties have worked together for an upcoming music video for the K-Pop group as well as in-game Overwatch 2 content. 
Le Sserafim is comprised of five performers: Kim Chaewon, Sakura, Huh Yunjin, Kazuha, and Hong Eunchae. The group and Blizzard are working together for a video for Le Sserafim's next single, "Perfect Night," and it will debut on October 26 at 9 p.m. PT. The collaboration also includes a Le Sserafim-inspired custom game mode for Overwatch 2 and exclusive in-game items like hero skins. More details about the in-game events will arrive on October 30, according to Blizzard, but the content goes live for players on November 1. 
"We're extremely excited to be working with Le Sserafim for our game's first musical artist collaboration," Overwatch general manager Walter Kong writes in a press release. "Like the heroes of Overwatch, the Le Sserafim members are amazing as individuals, but unstoppable when they come together." 
Blizzard says Le Sserafim will also make an appearance at this year's BlizzCon on November 4 to perform "Perfect Night" at the conclusion of the show.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It could well be argued that without the original Doom, there wouldn't be much of an FPS golden age, and that includes games like Half-Life. So, imagine my surprise when it turns out that someone has managed to take the aforementioned titles and package them under one roof. Kind of.


If you've always wanted to know what Doom 2 would be like with Half-Life's sound effects, then ModDB user DASniperIC (thanks, PCGamesN) has just the thing for you.




If you want an idea of what it sounds like when the enemies of one game cry out like injured scientists in the other, the footage gives you a taste. Not only does the mod replace the enemy howls and roars with things like Black Mesa scientists, but all the weapons now sound like they come from Valve's IP, too.


Imps as headcrab zombies...what a world!


As DASniperIC says, it's entirely possible someone else has tackled the concept already. However, this version is simply their take on a Doom/Half-Life crossover.


It's one of a gazillion ways that these legendary shooters continue to get the modding treatment and thus remain in the gaming limelight. Classic Doom is certainly no stranger to mods, having spent the better part of three decades receiving tweaks and custom options from its community. 


As for Half-Life, well, that's still getting a lot of love these days, even more so the sequel. In any case, modding legendary FPS games shows no signs of slowing down. Maybe someone will combine Doom with another game from a bygone era, like Blood. Oh, wait. That's totally a thing.

I’m just speculating, but it’s probably because it would be confused with Euro Truck Simulator 2.


According to the developer, Road Studio, they started as a small team but knew they needed more people to reach their vision. So they hired some veteran developers and quickly realized that they’d need to completely rebuild their code from the ground up.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the run-up to the scariest time of the year (no, not Black Friday...although...), many horror games are preparing to bring more spooks. No more is this true than with Outlast Trials, the newest installment in Red Barrels' twisted series.


In a recent post on Twitter/X, the developer has teased a new "objective enemy" that's being added to the game, specifically the Trial Map: Courthouse. This is all in conjunction with an upcoming update for the Outlast title. While there isn't a release date for the update yet, the tweet says it'll be coming by the end of October, and we all know what that means.




As for the new enemy themselves, the disturbing image depicts a man in pain, stripped of all but his underwear and wearing a makeshift helmet. Wires crisscross their exposed body, inserted into numerous parts, and the words "SHE'S GUILTY" can be seen scratched onto their leg.


Well you weren't expecting a unicorn, were you?


Alongside this, Red Barrels has restated some details about the upcoming console ports. Yes, Outlast Trials is coming to Xbox Series X|S and PS5. However, it's also getting Xbox One and PS4 versions, and will also have crossplay with PC.


Sadly, there's no definitive date for when these ports will be happening. All we know is the studio plans to unleash them sometime in "early 2024." Hopefully we'll have more information soon.


As we inch closer to Halloween, you can look forward to the new Outlast game rolling out new maps and cosmetics, a new mini-game for the lobby, and that happy chap above.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's rare that a developer explicitly introduces their game to you as "boring", and Indika seems anything but. Created by Odd Meter, the studio behind the well-received fantasy VR bow simulator Sacralith: The Archer's Tale, and published by Frostpunk developer 11 bit Studios, it's a "very serious adventure game" set in 19th century Russia, which casts you as a troubled young Orthodox Christian nun. Awash with doubts about her faith, and persecuted by a mysterious creature, the woman flees her nunnery and falls in with an escaped convict, who tells her of a mysterious "holy elder" who might ease her troubles, drawing on the power of a sacred artefact.
The game's setting is naturalistic, with motion-captured facial animations and photorealistic buildings and interiors, wrought using Unreal Engine. But it is also a "fairy tale" landscape, in the words of studio co-founder Dmitry Setlov, shot through with phantasmagorical flourishes - monochrome or blood-red filters and apparent hallucinations, to say nothing of the aforesaid creature, a skulking mass of tendrils that puts me in mind of the Shadow from Ursula K Le Guin's novel A Wizard Of Earthsea.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Being as much of an insufferable, online-but-ultimately-in-quite-a-basic-way person as I am, I'm a Junji Ito girlie. The horror manga artist has an immediately recognisable style that intersects detailed, line heavy art with strange and upsetting concepts, and some of his short stories have acquired a sort of semi-memetic status ("This is my hole! It was made for me!"). If you're at all familiar with Junji Ito's work you will look at unforgiving almost-text-adventure World Of Horror and go "Huh, that's inspired by Junji Ito."
This isn't just because it looks like his work but rendered in MSPaint, or because it contains, just, direct references to it, but because of the whole vibe. You encounter face-sloughing-off kinds of monsters and vengeful spirits inspired by Japanese folkloric yokai, but also weirdo janitors doing stuff like turning the swim team into mermaids in a kind of pervier version of Tusk. At the same time, there's a streak of the Lovecraftian in play to keep it nice and legally distinct, as each self-contained run at the titular world is an attempt to save your town from destruction at the hands of an Old God (they earn the leaden thud of the capital letters). You will fail a lot. But isn't failure part of the fun!? Imagine that enthusiastic question as a big spoonful of marmite popped into your mouth.

He often tells stories that start with grounded simplicity before quickly dropping them into a vat of inexplicable and undefined horror. He does a great job of starting off with a world that is uncomfortably off before pushing it to incomprehensible extremes. It’s not an uncommon approach to horror, but it’s one that his personal flourish aids so well.


I explain this because World of Horror is impossible to untangle from its inspiration. It feels very much like if Junji Ito had designed a monochromatic NEC PC-88 adventure title. The art style and st…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After a long hiatus, we're about to experience an explosion of Silent Hill releases. From the official remake of the second game to brand-new entries, Konami's iconic horror series is finally making a comeback. Along with these is Silent Hill: Ascension, which has just released its premiere trailer.


Billed as an interactive experience that viewers can influence the outcome of, Ascension's recent teaser gives a little taste of things to come. It also confirms – though we already knew at this point – that the "live series" will begin on October 31, starting at 9pm ET / 6pm PT. You can pre-install it by going to the official website.




It's being developed by J.J. Abram's Bad Robots Productions company in conjunction with Behaviour Interactive (yes, the people behind Dead by Daylight), Genvid Entertainment, and DJ2 Entertainment.


Make your choices


Each day, viewers will get to decide what happens to the characters in the Silent Hill experience. You'll get to watch (play?) it while also making decisions in real time. The story will play out depending on audience choices.


The story is described thus:



The Hernandez family plummets into chaos as another death shakes their decimated rust-belt town in Pennsylvania. In a dying fishing village in Norway, the uneasy peace of the Johansen family is upended when their matriarch, Ingrid, dies under suspicious circumstances. Survival depends on them overcoming their darkest impulses and the machinations of a cult, as they discover the horror that connects them.




While it's almost certainly going to be likened to such things as Bandersnatch, Ascension is at least a unique way of reigniting the Silent Hill flame. While many of you are eagerly awaiting Bloober Team's remake of SH2, Bad Robots' interactive offering is something a lot of horror fans will also be looking forward to.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wonder boy.
When Super Mario World first released back in 1990 (or '91 or '92 depending on your region), it felt like a huge moment for Nintendo's iconic platforming franchise. Here was Mario as we already knew him, bounding energetically through 2D environments on the way to his usual goal but, at the same time, everything felt as though it had changed.
Super Mario World was a thorough modernisation of all of the important pieces that made the series tick. The world and its characters were brought to life like never before with a broader range of animations and abilities, and mechanically things had taken a huge step up in terms of responsiveness and polish. This was the best a Mario game had ever looked or felt, it was full of fun and magic, it brought the somewhat ageing formula up to speed and remains one of the very best adventures the Italian plumber has ever taken.

In the early days of the plumber’s signature franchise, each game was branded with a sequential number. Most of us are familiar with the original NES trilogy (squabbles about the “real” Super Mario Bros. 2 notwithstanding), but slightly less known is that Super Mario World was actually labeled as “Super Mario Bros. 4” in Japan. However, after this fourth mainline entry, the series took a sharp turn away from that classic side-scrolling style. Super Mario World 2: Yoshi’s Island is a stellar game, but it's not one that I nor Nintendo consider a mainline Mario game. And with Super Mario 64, it appeared that the moustached hero’s future was now firmly in the third dimension.

Wonder over the last couple of weeks (in addition to the hands-on I had as a part of our current cover story), and the review embargo has officially lifted.

With that said, I did want to share some brief thoughts within the confines of the embargo.
I've loved my time with Super Mario Bros. Wonder. The game is aptly named for a title that instills a strong sense of wonder around every corner.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[More than two years after its initial reveal trailer, Marvel's Spider-Man 2 is almost here. Due out October 20 exclusively on PlayStation 5, developer Insomniac Games' sequel to 2018's Marvel's Spider-Man and 2020's Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales is a game we thoroughly enjoyed – read Game Informer's Marvel's Spider-Man 2 review here – and we're excited for others to play it. Insomniac is too, but in a new statement, it tells players that while the game will be playable on physical discs in full, it recommends downloading the day one patch. 
More specifically, the download update is Version 1.001.002 and it will be available at launch this Friday. Digital owners don't need to worry about this as the patch will be installed as part of the pre-loaded version of Marvel's Spider-Man 2.

October 17, 2023
"The disc contains the entire game and is playable from start to finish with no patch or online requirement," Insomniac's statement reads. "But for the best experience, we highly encourage physical/disc-based players to download update Version 1.001.002 on launch day – prior to experiencing the opening mission of the game for the first time. Digital players – don't worry, if you pre-load the digital version of the game, you'll get 1.001.002 as your pre-loaded version." 
As for why, Insomniac says this update features polish to the gold master of Marvel's Spider-Man 2 available on disc. It improves the opening sections of the game and includes other general refinements to the Spidey experience. It also includes some additional accessibility options. 
Marvel's Spider-Man 2 hits PlayStation 5 on October 20.

On 19th August 1839, a young man opens his eyes to find himself in a vast, silent castle in the forests of Prussia. He discovers a letter from his "past self", Daniel, who urges him to murder the castle's secluded owner, a baron named Alexander, and warns that he is being hunted by a monstrous Shadow. 60 years later on New Year's Eve, the celebrated meat factory owner Oswald Mandus starts awake in the opulent stillness of his manor house in London. Hearing the distant voices of his children, he goes to look for them in the "splendid architectures" below.
On 21st July 1916, at the height of World War I, the soldier Henri Clément stumbles from his sickbed in a colossal bunker beneath the Western Front. With nobody about, and no memory of events during his convalescence, he follows a trail of blood through the collapsing tunnels towards the pantry. And on an unknown day in March 1939, the engineering drafter Tasi Trianon wakes in the wreckage of a plane, deep in the Algerian desert, and enters the nearby caves in search of her husband Salim. Four games, four forgotten pasts, four new beginnings, one descent.
Beware: major spoilers for the entire Amnesia series below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let's ride.
After being revealed back in the hazy days of this summer, Atari has today announced that the deluxe edition of the rollercoaster park management sim, RollerCoaster Tycoon Adventures Deluxe, will be speeding its way onto Switch digitally on 1st November and physically just two days later on 3rd November.
There's a brand-new trailer for the upcoming deluxe package that you can check out above which showcases some of the 80 new rides and attractions that developers Graphite Lab and Nvizzio Creations have added to this one. Alongside these newbies, the game also sees a fresh interface and performance optimisations so that park building should run smoother than ever before (we hope).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If XCOM and Invisible, Inc. had a secret one-night stand in the back of a Cyberpunk 2077 taxi, the resulting lovechild would probably look a lot like Cyber Knights: Flashpoint. It's the next game from the Trese Brothers, the makers of Star Traders: Frontiers, and I've been playing its opening missions over the last couple of days. It's good, folks, and there's a lot to dig into with its release into early access this week. 
There's a sizable story campaign and a bunch of side missions already playable here, and its emphasis on stealth and escalating security levels whisked me right back to the good old days of 2015 when I first sat down to play Klei's stealthy masterpiece. There are still a couple of rough edges here and there, but if you've been looking for a strategy RPG with a harder-edge than, say, Mimimi's recently released Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew, or just something a bit sneakier than your run of XCOM-likes, Cyber Knights: Flashpoint is definitely worth keeping an augmented eye on.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cream of the crop.
We had a great time with Fae Farm when it laid down roots on Switch last month, though there was a handful of pesky bugs that slightly marred our experience. Fortunately, publisher and developer Phoenix Labs has been quick on the case and the game's latest update (ver. 1.4.0) seems to have even more bugs in its sight.
There are a good number of fixes this time around ranging from gameplay to more specific features. Some of the stand-out changes are the in-game clock pausing when you use the storage shed or mailbox in single-player (shout out to the time management fans out there!), tweaks to the relationship mechanics and a fix that keeps your animals producing materials for you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in the glorious Xbox One years, when every Microsoft executive was engaged in the act of putting one foot in their mouth while shooting it simultaneously, there was a giddy period of marketing conducted by means of Phil Spencer's T-shirts. He'd rock up on E3 stages like a cabaret dancer, touting tees with various new or elderly videogame licenses on them, and whipping older fans into a frenzy of speculation as to possible remakes or sequels. I myself had to go lie down after seeing Phil in a Phantom Dust shirt. Teaser-shirts, we should have called them. Look at him in the picture up there, showing off a chestful of Hexen. Shameless!


Sadly/happily, those halcyon days are behind us, but Phil still loves to dangle the carrot of an ancient IP now and then. Speaking on the Xbox podcast last night (while sporting a boring Halo championship jacket), he suggested that Microsoft could do more to revive their older franchises. Or at least "revisit" them in some fashion.

We're just a couple of short days away from the launch of Nintendo's latest 2D Mario adventure, Super Mario Bros. Wonder, and the hype train is well and truly chugging away at full speed. We've gone hands-on with the game recently and came away feeling incredibly optimistic, but of course, we're all waiting on tenderhooks to see what the review scores will be like, right?
Well, thanks to Ryokutya2089 (via Gematsu), we now have our first review courtesy of Japanese gaming publication Famitsu, and it's looking mighty promising indeed.

Paradox will keep ownership of The Lamplighters League and other games developed by Harebrained, though the Crusader Kings publisher have no plans for a project or sequel in the same genre.

Following a round of previews for WarioWare: Move It!, Nintendo has now released a new overview trailer for the game.
Although it's only in Japanese at the moment, if it's like other overview trailers, Nintendo will probably localise it. In it, you can see three whole minutes of micro-game action from Nintendo-themed games to some completely random ones.

Sonic Superstars marks a step back to the Genesis-era 2D platforming that put the series on the map and a leap forward by letting three more friends join the adventure. While the former largely succeeds in providing an enjoyable nostalgic experience, the latter fails to allow partners to have the same amount of fun.

        <updated>2023-10-17T20:18:57.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Igor Aleksandrowicz has fully released their retro-inspired FPS, Calcium Contract, on Steam. It will run you $15.99.


I first tried out Calcium Contract back in July and came away impressed by its unique and unusual take on the subgenre. Back then, I said, “It feels like if Duke Nukem 3D was designed by a studio localized within McDonaldsland." I kind of stand by that. It’s a bizarre and colorful experience about a Grim Reaper who has to bring down a chicken serpent that simply refuses to die.




Unlike most other games in the genre, Calcium Contract isn’t about big guns and bigger explosions. Its arsenal consists of a number of strange contraptions that shoot things like musical golden bones. Likewise, the enemies are a vast mixture of chickens, cats, and lizards. Aleksandrowicz says their focus was on “game feel” and that really shows. There are lots of small touches that are used to heighten your connection with the world, and cleverly removing wall-humping secrets means that the pacing is never bogged down.


If anything, Calcium Contract’s biggest issue is that it doesn’t have a lot of the biggest selling points that people look for with these sorts of games (i.e. big guns and bigger explosions). That’s too bad since it’s every bit as intense as one with more conventional munitions. My hope is that it will still develop a large following in spite of this.


Unfortunately, I don’t think I’ll have time to do a formal review of this one. However, my preview earlier in the year covered a pretty sizeable chunk of the game (more than what was included in the demo), so the preview I did will still hold true today.


Calcium Contract is available right now for PC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With the release of Intel's somewhat underwhelming 14th-gen processors today, I feel a lot of people are going to be looking once more at AMD Ryzen 7000 systems. These CPUs offer the same access to DDR5 RAM and PCIe 5.0 components as Intel's latest offerings, yet typically consume less power while delivering better gaming performance at the high end. That makes it easier to build a balanced system, especially with deals on Ryzen 7000 CPUs and motherboards starting to become more commonplace. 
Case in point is this AWD-IT bundle deal on a Ryzen 5 7600X and an MSI MAG B650 Tomahawk WiFi motherboard for £400, versus £445 for the two items separately. That's a pretty fair deal!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last time I was face to face with an aerial Moby Dick, it was in Death Stranding. Well, it's back to the skyward trenches, apparently, because massive mammals are on the menu in Project: Mist. Developer Chicken Launcher and publisher Awaken Realms revealed the title as an open-world survival horror game that gives off serious The Forest vibes. 


Thanks to Gematsu, we know a little more about the colossal terrors of Project Mist. While there's no release date, Project: Mist is in the works for PC and, as promised, features flying whales front and center. If that's not too harrowing for you this Halloween season, you can see them along with other sizable threats in the announcement trailer.




Project: Mist promises "full freedom" with "no forced quest[s], no hand holding, no telling you what to do." You're basically plopped smack dab in the middle of a harsh world with survival as the main goal. As you no doubt noticed in the trailer, flying whales aren't the only thing you'll have to worry about. There are big ugly heads, nasty mouth things, and even bigger and slimier dudes? Those aren't the canonical Project: Mist names, but they'll do for now. 


Thankfully, it sounds like you'll have plenty of countermeasures at your disposal. In addition to building a base and defending it from threats, you can create traps, weapons, and other essential items. There are axes, crossbows, guns, and apparently a "game-changing" Gravity Gun. It's not clear exactly how that one works yet, but maybe we'll learn more soon.


Chicken Launcher not included


The developer behind Project: Mist previously worked on games like 2022's No Place Like Home. The cute, relaxing sim garnered some positive reviews, and seems as thematically distant from Chicken Launcher's latest as possible. A Steam page is live now, so we'll just have to wait to learn the secrets of the giant wall.

Well, I didn't have this one on my Season of Blood bingo card. Season 2 of Diablo 4 was supposed to launch, well, 10 minutes or so ago. Instead, Blizzard released a post on their forums announcing that some technical issues have popped up with the current build. According to the post, they anticipate the delay of Season 2 to be "by a few hours" while they remedy the issues.




Blizzard's definition of a few hours have varied between like one hour and several days in the past. Hopefully, it's on the shorter side today.


Wait, who do I blame now? Microsoft? Bobby Kotick still? Just kidding. Mostly.


Diablo 4 Season 2, Season of Blood, launches soon™ on all platforms.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The WarioWare series is still going strong, with a new title on the horizon for early next month. The shoes are not yet empty, but Onion Soup Interactive is looking to fill them anyway with Super 56. That’s bold, but while they’re doing some heavy lifting to the formula, they’re bringing along their own drinks to the party. To be fair, it isn’t even WarioWare’s party. Puzzle & Action: Tant-R has been dancing since ‘93, but even I’m not certain they were the first to arrive.


Super 56 is a microgame rush. To draw further comparison to WarioWare it leans heavily into nostalgia for older games. It also digs into absurd humor until it hits paydirt. So, I guess what I’m saying is it’s not the absolute most original game, but it still has a lot to offer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Spotted by Twitter user Timur222 and reported by Game World Observer it appears that the latest to be affected by layoffs within Embracer Group and the video game industry in general are Cryptic Studios and Zen Studios.


The news has come as a result of multiple employees within the studios updating their Linkedin profiles to seek new employment opportunities. Because of this, it’s unknown just how many are affected by these layoffs, which appear to have happened last week, and Embracer has not released a statement to clarify.




Cryptic Studios rose to prominence with the development of City of Heroes (my favorite MMO) and continues to maintain Champions Online, Star Trek Online, and Neverwinter. Meanwhile, Zen Studios is the developer behind the Zen Pinball and Pinball FX series.


The layoffs are part of a continued cost-cutting campaign by Embracer Group. The company had previously launched an aggressive acquisition campaign and bought out a number of developers, large and small. This seems to be related to a $2 Billion dollar investment that reportedly fell through earlier in the year.


Embracer isn’t the only one conducting layoffs. This year has been horrible when it comes to people losing their jobs, not just in the video game industry but the tech industry in general. The list is a bit long, and it’s really depressing, so I’m just going to copy what Destructoid’s own Eric “Boulder Puncher” Van Allen wrote previously:


"A brief list includes Epic Games, Striking Distance Studios, CD Projekt Red, multiple studios owned by Embracer Group including Beamdog and Crystal Dynamics, Ubisoft, BioWare, Relic, Riot, Firaxis, and Microsoft. Plus reports of more at Twitch, Naughty Dog, and Team17. On top of all that, there was also the shutdown of Dang!, PixelOpus, Vanpool, and Volition Games."

If you have ever thought even remotely deeply about the reality of the Super Mario universe (which we wouldn't recommend doing, seriously), then you might have bumped up against the most simple of questions: why does Mario get hurt when a Goomba hits him? As it turns out, this is something that Miyamoto was asked back in the days of the NES, and only with Super Mario Bros. Wonder, has Nintendo managed to visualise the reason.
According to a new 'Ask the Developer' interview that Nintendo has published today, Miyamoto's answer back then was because the Goombas bite Mario on impact (at least, that's the way that Wonder's art director, Masanobu Sato remembers it), and so the Wonder developers decided to add an animation into the upcoming platformer to make this statement a reality.

This is all kind of shocking to me, simply because it doesn’t seem like that long ago that Harebrained Schemes was acquired. However, following the launch of The Lamplighters League, Paradox said that they’d be taking a write-down on the production, as they don’t expect to recoup the development costs. Destructoid’s own Steven “Big Lifter” Mills has a pretty great write-up of that here.

It takes a lot to make a game about giant robot battles feel dull, but somehow Front Mission 2: Remake manages it. While it improves on some of the shortcomings of Front Mission 1st: Remake, the combat system isn’t fun enough to fully salvage this tactical RPG. While it might be worthwhile for strategy fans eager to test out G-Craft's 1997 PlayStation game that never got released outside of Japan, we can’t see Front Mission 2: Remake offering much to anyone else.
It’s a shame that the actual combat in Front Mission 2: Remake is so frustrating because the story is much improved over the previous entry. You control a group of soldiers who find themselves on the losing side of a coup and are trying to flee the nation of Alordesh. Warfare in this setting takes place almost exclusively in Wanzers, which are highly customisable mechs of varying levels of effectiveness depending on how you outfit them.

        <updated>2023-10-17T16:28:58.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mark “Markiplier” Fischbach has posted a short teaser for his upcoming film adaptation of Iron Lung, a 2022 horror game from David Szymanski. According to Fischbach, who is directing, writing, and starring in the adaptation, it's  “coming soon to theaters”. A nice surprise for fans used to his work launching as YouTube exclusives. 


In the teaser, which features music by Andrew Hulshult and narration by JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure voice actor Mick Lauer, we see what is presumably the main character emerging from a sea of blood and ominous lightning. 




Fans of Fischbach (and, by extension, listeners of his podcast Distractible) will note that he recently went to the hospital on his birthday because he went “too deep in the blood.” The stunt resulted in his eyes turning a worrying shade of red. It was clear at the time that it was related to the production of Iron Lung, but now the teaser makes it clear it's most likely the cause of that incident.


Iron Lung is “a short horror game where you pilot a tiny submarine through an ocean of blood on an alien moon,” according to developer and publisher David Szymanski, known for works like DUSK, Chop Goblins, and Squirrel Stapler. Fischbach announced a film adaptation in April, and fans have received periodic behind-the-scenes updates both via YouTube and Distractible.


Destructoid’s Zoey Handley had this to say about Iron Lung: “It’s a brilliant approach to the horror genre. It keeps you feeling perpetually vulnerable. There is nothing to help you and absolutely no escape. Your only option is to keep pressing ahead, as there’s no rescue until the job is done. Don’t get distracted, ignore the sounds. Hurry, but be careful not to bash into a wall. I don’t think it’s possible to represent that idea better in an interactive medium. Iron Lung really is the perfect short-form horror experience.”

We are just days away from the release of Super Mario Bros. Wonder on Switch and, as has become something of a tradition, Nintendo has today released the first two parts of an all-new 'Ask the Developer' interview series about the upcoming game.
The conversation covers a range of topics including how the team settled on the theme of 'wonder' and the changes that have been made to the game's visuals and sound design, but one section that immediately stood out to us was all about the influence that Illumination's The Super Mario Bros. Movie had on the game. You might assume that the film's forecasted success (remember, both were in development around the same time) would have weighed heavily on the developer's minds, potentially even influencing the bros. new game designs; but, as it turns out, this was not the case.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Systemic Reaction has announced that they have canceled further development on their multiplayer dinosaur FPS, Second Extinction, and has removed it from sale on marketplaces. Servers are set to close down for it in 2024.


Second Extinction entered Early Access in October 2020, and never really left. The initial goal was to fully launch late last year, but that got delayed due to “critical issues.” After assessing things, the team has decided just to drop it and move on.


“Unfortunately, it became clear that our small team lacked the resources necessary to hit our quality targets and exit Early Access and Game Preview, and the investment needed to do so was too large for us to bear. After evaluating our options and working during this year to find other potential solutions, this became the reality our team had to face.”


Interestingly, Systemic Reaction is part of Avalanche Studios Group, which, in turn, is a subsidiary of Nordisk Film. If we take them by their word, then that must be one hell of a corner they painted themselves into.


Every cloud, I guess


While the cancellation of a game that people have already paid for is pretty crappy, there is one silver lining here:


“Although this isn’t the outcome any of us hoped for, we want to assure you that there are no layoffs associated with this decision.”


Ideally, studios should be able to make mistakes and be able to turn around from it. It’s just not a great look when the expense is all on their supporters. The developer doesn’t really have the best track record to begin with, having made Generation Zero and Ravenbound, neither of which got the best reception. Perhaps that’s part of the decision to can Second Extinction.


Nonetheless, there’s always a chance for a developer to turn things around, and here’s hoping that Systemic Reaction can do just that and gain back the trust of the supporters who might feel burned by this cancellation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Having dipped into some deathmatches in Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 3's beta over the weekend, I have come to the conclusion that - surprise! - it's more Call Of Duty! But the biggest surprise? How familiar it felt. So, it might be a bit odd that MW3 is wholly unsurprising for being more COD and simultaneously, a surprise for being more COD. Really, I think it comes down to developer Sledgehammer's decision to mash some of COD's previous triumphs with some of its finest maps.
Despite COD extending its hand with a warm welcome back, I can't help but feel it's one trembled with nerves. MW3's beta suckered me in with its nostalgia hits but there's definitely an air of it being a stopgap as devs figure out where it should turn next.

It will inevitably result in a subpar experience.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's not been a great launch for Payday 3. As well as experiencing issues with matchmaking, the new entry in the bank-robbing FPS has also had its first major patch delayed. Now, the developer has issued yet another apology, saying that the anticipated update needs "additional time."


Over on Twitter, the official Payday 3 account apologized to fans for the "lack of communication regarding the first patch.". Starbreeze Studios says it's found more issues to rectify before the patch launches. 




An additional post underneath notes due to the additional time needed to tend to the game, the studio can't provide an ETA on when fixes will launch just yet. A third tweet adds a suffix to this apology, saying that both the patch and some more news are inbound. We just don't know when.


Maybe it'll be worth it in the end


While the studio did do some maintenance to make Payday 3's matchmaking better, one of the major criticisms with the game is the always-online feature. This means that even if you want to play a solo campaign, you're still required to connect to the server.


However, there is a possibility that an offline mode could come to the game. In a previous post on Twitter/X, the team said that, because of server issues at launch, "we are discussing every option available to us, including offline mode."


Hopefully, Payday 3 will eventually become the game fans want it to be. At the moment, it has a "Mixed" review score on Steam, with more than a few unhappy customers. Starbreeze has a chance to turn things around, though.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sometimes, it's hard to know what to make of Twitch. On the one hand, the streaming platform is experiencing peak viewership, but on the other, the company is reportedly laying staff off. Still, it's business as usual, and it looks as though the Amazon-owned company now wants a slice of that social media pie.


In a recent blog post, Twitch announced the introduction of stories to its app. Those who regularly use Facebook or Instagram will already be familiar with this feature. Essentially, Twitch has "made it easier for you to reach your community directly on Twitch, through short posts that expire in 48 hours."




This appears to be a work-in-progress and will have "more features in the coming months". And given Twitch's reputation for being a hotbed of hatred and general toxic behavior, safety measures are factored into stories "in a way that fosters a safe space for you and your community."


Not available for everyone yet, though


However, the post does make it clear that this feature is not rolling out to all users just yet. For now, they're "currently limited to Partners & Affiliates who have had at least one stream in the last 30 days."


There are plans to make it available to eligible users by the end of the week. However, streamers will need to "meet the minimum eligibility requirements." There's always a catch with these things.


Whatever you think about the new feature, it seems Twitch is looking to keep its head above water by rolling out additional bells and whistles. It could be a neat way for content creators to stay in touch when not live. Equally, it could be another headache in an era already swamped by social media.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just in time for the holidays, Whitethorn Games and Gameous have announced that Lake: Season's Greetings will launch on November 15, 2023.


Season’s Greetings is a prequel chapter of the small-town slice-of-life game Lake. Set before the events of the base game, you’re dropped in Providence Oaks as protagonist Meredith’s father, Thomas Weiss. He was previously an offscreen character in Lake, but now will get to color in the backstory with his own point of view. It’s 1985 in a small town, and that’s sort of relaxing. Let’s rent some horror and shove it into the VHS player.




Not only that, but, as the title implies, the town is completely cloaked in snow. Thomas is delivering packages during the height of the holidays, which probably means Christmas music. I can’t say I’m down for that because I have a lot of trauma from working in retail for a couple of holidays. It might be even worse than that pop country in the base Lake.


I felt pretty lukewarm about Lake back when I reviewed it. This was mostly because I felt that the narrative really thought you should love small towns and look down on the busy lives of urban dwellers. I grew up in a rural area, and while it has its comforts, it’s not all fresh apple pie and how-do-you-dos.


On the other hand, I love a good holiday game and am often interested to see if a developer takes feedback into account when revisiting a concept. November might be a busy month, but maybe I’ll be able to fit in another visit to Providence Oaks.


Lake: Season's Greetings launches on November 15, 2023 on PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S.

One of the great things about PC gaming (typically) is the ability to tinker with vanilla releases. In this case, one person has taken Bethesda's sci-fi RPG and injected a dose of Doctor Who.


Over on Nexus Mods, user xShadowBlitzz has brought the iconic Daleks to Starfield, replacing the sanitation mini bots that scuttle about the place.


Image via xShadowBlitzz/Nexus Mods.


From the description, this mod is currently a work-in-progress, featuring three textured Daleks so far. It also looks as though they don't have their sound effects yet, but they could be coming in a future update.


Are we bored with Starfield yet?


There's no denying that there's a lot to see in the game, but the newest IP from the Skyrim studio already feels like it's dropped off the radar a tad. Its hype was all too real, with the game becoming one of the most successful launches of this console generation.


It's too early to say at this stage, but some may be wondering whether it will outlast the likes of TES5. The 2011 fantasy RPG has somehow kept itself in the limelight (probably helped by all those re-releases). Some of this longevity can be attested to the modding community.


Whether Starfield will be able to boast such a legacy more than ten years from now cannot be said. However, if Bethesda keeps on top of things with new content and bug fixes (look it up, Todd), it could stand the test of time. Also, mods. More mods will probably help.

Nintendo UK has launched a new competition to mark the release of Super Mario Bros. Wonder, and this one is all about spotting some special Mario-themed buses around London.
Revealed in a tweet yesterday, NUK announced that there is a Mario Wonder prize pack (consisting of a t-shirt, pin pack diorama, Talking Flower figure and more) available for the winner and all that you need to do is take a picture of one of the special Mario buses that are currently touring around London and post it to Twitter with the relevant hashtag. There is a bus for Mario, Luigi, Peach, Toad and Yoshi, so you would use #MarioBus, #LuigiBus, #PeachBus etc. depending on which one you are lucky enough to see.

If you cast your mind back to the summer, you might remember the leak and later reveal of Skull Island: Rise of Kong, a third-person "action-adventure game" from publishers GameMill Entertainment set to release in the busiest week of the Switch's 2023 calendar (which is today, 17th October, if you're wondering). Well, with the title now available to pick up, it appears that the packed release date should have been the least of our worries.
We weren't expecting a lot from Kong's latest foray into the gaming world (2005's catchily-titled Peter Jackson's King Kong: The Official Game of the Movie on the GameCube is quite enough for us, thank you very much), but what we have seen today is unexpectedly hilarious. Several players who were unfortunate enough to pick up Skull Island have taken to Twitter to share some gameplay footage and the results are... something else.

Line Rider, Happy Wheels, and Bloons all started their careers via Flash, and while some of these games do make a return every so often, as the upcoming Alien Hominid remaster, they've certainly fallen out of favour with the younger crowd.


Now, even though Newgrounds continues to exist, the legendary Adobe Flash content repository is not nearly as culturally relevant today as it once used to be. That is not to say, however, that Flash games have been totally taken out of the equation. Notably, Flash developer Mateusz Skutnik - whose name may ring a bell for the older folks - has just released an all-new entry in his Submachine puzzle series. This is, of cou…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The fleetingly Epic Games-owned online audio distribution company Bandcamp have shed "at least" half their staff in the course of being sold off to Songtradr as part of mass layoffs at Epic this summer. That's according to the union Bandcamp United, who are even now restarting discussions with Epic in the hope of obtaining a better outcome.
It's terrible news for those affected, of course, but it also doesn't bode well for the future of independent music. Bandcamp, which has now traded hands twice in two years, is one of the few places where indie musicians can make a living. There are plenty of angry reactions from musicians and bands on social media, as you'd expect, but game developers are also rallying in support of Bandcamp United, with criticism aimed at Epic and Songtradr in equal measure.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Speed up, superstar.
If you’d have told us that two of gaming’s most iconic rivals, Mario and Sonic, would be going head-to-head with two brand-new platformers in the space of a week, we’d have said you were probably off your rocker. What’s more, if you’d have said that Sega’s latest entry, Sonic Superstars, would turn out to provide one of the strongest Sonic campaigns ever created, well quite frankly, we’d be pinching ourselves to double-check that we weren’t dreaming.
Yet here we are, folks. Sonic Superstars is here and it’s an absolute belter. It successfully blends the classic 2D gameplay formula from Sonic’s retro outings (with a big help from Sonic Mania’s physics system) with a modernised visual aesthetic, all the while introducing a handful of brand-new elements that, while not groundbreaking in their execution, are fun little extras that feel destined to evolve in future entries. For a while, it felt like Sonic Team was treading water with its side-on Sonic entries, but developer Arzest has delivered a game that gives Sega’s mascot a kick in the right 2D direction.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["I am most moved and always have been by stupid courage — the kind when, against all odds, the hero just keeps going," William Goldman once said. This is a thing Goldman I have in common. To help you tell us apart, a point of difference between Goldman and I is that he expressed his love of stupid courage by writing Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid, whereas I express mine by really liking Cyberpunk 2077.

Stupid courage is a trait that CD Projekt Red's first-person RPG seems to admire, but that's never more clear than in a new ending to the base game added by the Phantom Liberty expansion. It shows what happens when the heroes reject stupid courage and choose self-centred pragmatism instead. Spoilers for Cyberpunk 2077 and Phantom Liberty throughout.

Naturally, Epic will be continuing with their free games program through "2023 and beyond", and they've also put together a couple of special publishing offers for developers, Epic First Run and Now on Epic, which are designed to lure more studios from the amoeba-like embrace of Valve's gaming empire.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developed by Neowiz Games and Round8 Studio, and released on September 18, Lies of a P is a soulslike that has managed to stand out in its oversaturated genre by offering a unique take on Carlo Collodi's The Adventures of Pinocchio. Developers have revealed that the game has already sold a million copies globally. 




This achievement comes with relatively good critical acclaim, and it currently has "Very Positive" user reviews on Steam. Commenting on the milestone in a press release, Neowiz CEO Seungchul Kim stated that "this incredible milestone for Lies of P proves the potential of Korean console games on the global stage."


Both South Korean studios should be very proud of their success, though it did not come easily, and Kim reveals that "the Lies of P project was a challenging endeavor for Neowiz and Round8 Studio." There were also a few minor controversies along the way, including the removal of an anti-cop sign in the game. 


Developers are just beginning to enjoy the fruits of their labor, as the game has also received some notable award show nominations. This includes a "Best Visual Design" nomination at this year's Golden Joystick Awards ceremony.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s almost time for Alan Wake 2, but if you haven’t played the original (or if you’d like to replay it before you jump into the sequel) you can get Alan Wake, as well as seven other spooky games, for $13. 


This deal is part of Humble Bundle’s “Fright of Your Life” bundle. The proceeds of this month's bundle go to support International Medical Corps and Direct Relief. If you pay at least $13, you can add STASIS: Bone Totem, Bendy and the Ink Machine, Bendy and the Dark Revival, Alan Wake Collector’s Edition, Hidden Deep, Tormented Souls, Pathologic 2, and Moons of Madness to your library on Steam.


Plus, it's the Alan Wake Collector’s Edition. This version includes not only the base game but also a pair of special episodes called “The Signal” and “The Writer." There's also developer commentary, an illustrated PDF book, and a soundtrack with nearly an hour of fully mastered audio tracks composed by Petri Alanko, Old Gods of Asgard, and Poets of the Fall. 


It’s just in time for the sequel, Alan Wake 2, on October 27 for the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series, and PC via the Epic Games Store. The game's director, Sam Lake, also recently confirmed his plans for free DLC at this year's EGX. That is to say, catch up now before your Alan Wake to-do list grows too long. 


In addition to experiencing (for the first time, no less) the Pacific Northwest adventures of Alan Wake, being able to add both games in the Bendy and the Ink Machine duology to my library makes this bundle one I don’t want to pass up. I still haven’t been able to play Bendy and the Dark Revival, so this might be my best opportunity.

There was, of course, the Future Of Play booth that our Graham organised for the show (the contents of which you can see right here), but every year the Leftfield Collection houses a couple more custom controller games that are just as illustrative of all the amazing things going on in the world of interactive entertainment these days. 
Case in point, there were two games from this year's cohort that impressed me in equal measure over the weekend - and it was perhaps fitting that they were located directly opposite one another in the Leftfield Collection's long, white corridor. One was a mind-bogglingly complex, almost military-grade-looking briefcase stuffed full of switches, nozzles and buttons, and the other was an impossibly cute cardboard flip book and projector combo that let its cartoon hero Bib bound across the 3D paper environments to find a way home. Here's a little look at both of them in action.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With the launch of Season 2, Season of Blood, Diablo 4 will be running another Twitch Drop campaign. This specific campaign takes place over four weeks and will reward viewers with various Oricalchum cosmetics. Each week a separate cosmetic is obtainable, with viewers having to watch four hours total of anyone in the Diablo 4 category on Twitch in order to obtain the drop.

Diablo 4 Season 2 Twitch Drop Schedule


Here is the complete schedule for the Diablo 4 Season 2 Twitch Drop campaign over the next four weeks:


Week 1: Twitch Drops for Necromancer, Rogue, and Sorcerer



Start Time: October 17, 10 a.m. PDT


End Time: October 24, 11:59 a.m. PDT


Cosmetic: Oricalchum Blade Item Cosmetic



Week 2: Twitch Drops for Barbarian and Druid



Start Time: October 24, 12 p.m. PDT


End Time: October 31, 11:59 a.m. PDT


Reward: Oricalchum Mallet Item Cosmetic



Week 3: Twitch Drops for Barbarian and Necromancer



Start Time: October 31, 12 p.m. PDT


End Time: November 6, 11:59 a.m. PDT


Reward: Oricalchum Greatsword Item Cosmetic



Week 4: Twitch Drops for Druid



Start Time: November 6, 12 p.m. PST


End Time: November 13, 12 p.m. PST


Reward: Oricalchum Quarterstaff Item Cosmetic



Overall the Orichalcum cosmetics look pretty clean. They aren't flashy or anything, but I kind of prefer that way. Instead, they looked sturdy and intricately laden with Orichalcum, I guess to help slay vampires, which is the theme of the season.


Diablo 4 Season 2, Season of Blood, begins on October 17 on all platforms.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I love it when game names do what they say on the tin, but I love it even more when they contain hidden depths behind that initial simplicity. Hermit And Pig is indeed a game about a reclusive old hermit and his truffle-hunting pig, but this charming adventure RPG also has one of the most involving turn-based battle systems I've come across in a while. 
Taking place in first person a la Dragon Quest, Hermit must deal with all sorts of mad and angry wildlife as he hunts for his favourite forest mushrooms, and their scowling (and endearingly daft) expressions are just the tip of this excellent iceberg. For you're not just choosing from a list of moves and watching them play out onscreen. Oh no. Each attack also comes with its own three-button fighting combo, and you'll need to input the right one (often at the right time) to deal the most damage. It's a brilliant system, making Hermit And Pig easily one of this year's highlights from EGX's Leftfield Collection.

Wonder declared the series’ return to the 2D side-scrolling genre with a colorful bang. The game signals the return to Mario’s roots from a core gameplay perspective, but it’s more connected to Mario’s past than most people initially realized. While many remember the creative level design, expressive art style, and discovery of the game-changing Wonder Flowers, the most memorable moment came at the end of the announcement trailer, as everyone’s favorite plumber grabbed a never-before-seen item and transformed into an elephant. That moment told everyone that Super Mario Bros. Wonder, despite taking the series back to its 2D origins, is trying bold, new things unlike anything the franchise has seen before.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pete Hines, head of publishing at Elder Scrolls, Fallout and Starfield studio Bethesda, is retiring. One of the most public faces at the developer behind perhaps only Toddy H himself, Hines has played a prominent role in the release of their biggest games for close to the last quarter-of-a-century - but says that the “time is right” to move on to “an exciting new chapter of my life”.

As a speed-focused arcade racer, Hot Wheels Unleashed 2: Turbocharged is a joy thanks to the emphasis on going fast, collecting Hot Wheels cars spanning decades, and crafting your own tracks. However, it doesn’t quite have the variety of tracks to keep it fresh throughout, and the story mode is an innocuous affair, leading to middle-of-the-pack results instead of the checkered flag it was chasing.
While it may not be as technical as most racing sims or as silly as the Mario Kart serie…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you played a videogame at all in 2022, I hope it was Roadwarden. A blend of RPG and visual novel from Polish developer Moral Anxiety, it cast you as lonesome wayfarer maintaining the paths and investigating the mysteries or grievances of a thinly populated wilderness setting. It's a game of immense feeling, craft and cleverness, inspired by table-top games, which puts hoarier ideas about videogame role-playing through the wringer. In the world of Roadwarden, there's no grinding for XP or mindless loot-crafting treadmill. Knowledge, empathy and insight are worth far more than material wealth or wielding the shiniest axe. Quests can hinge on something as minute as your ear for dialects or knowing the correct form of address. And each village along the trail is a world in itself.


Moral Anxiety's Windy Meadow - which actually dates back to before development of Roadwarden, but has been substantially remastered since the latter's release - essentially narrows the focus to one of those villages. Out today, it's a quietly gorgeous visual novel in which you follow several characters in different timeframes, building up a layered understanding of one and the same setting, with scene transitions plotted on a beautiful pixelart map screen.

The memos and emails in question are from now-defunct US gun company Remington Arms, which was once part of the conglomerate Freedom Group. They've been disclosed by a lawyer as part of legal proceedings launched by the parents of children killed in the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre, in which 20-year-old Adam Lanza shot and killed 26 people using a Remington-made AR15 rifle.

Made by the same team behind 2018's Project Hospital, Silence Of The Siren is an homage to Heroes Of Might And Magic where several different alien races are fighting to control a distant alien planet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Analogue Pocket is a retro handheld marvel, capable of playing your favorite Game Boy and Game Boy Advance games on its beautiful screen with modern sensibilities and technology – simply put, it's the best way to play a Game Boy game, assuming you can get your hands on the always-sold-out device. Now, Analogue is targeting the Nintendo 64 catalog with its next device, the Analogue 3D. 
Analogue has shared an image of what appears to be the device, although the full look at it is obscured. You can view it at the top of the article, but it's below as well:
An image released alongside today's news teases what appears to be a sleek, black, and faithful recreation of the Nintendo 64 controller. You can check it out below: 
Analogue says the 3D device will feature 4K HDMI output, its proprietary Analogue OS, wireless Bluetooth, and 2.4G Wi-Fi. It will also have "4 original-style controller ports," presumably so that players can use their original Nintendo 64 controllers with the 3D. The company says the 3D's 4K output allowed "us to created incomprehensibly profound Original Display Modes," and that in collaboration with 8BitDo, it will release a wireless controller for the device. 
Analogue didn't share more, but the 3D is set to release some time in 2024. Preorders are not yet open, but if it's like the Pocket release, preorders will happen well before the actual release (and if you want one, plan on preordering because the Pockets sold out immediately). 

While waiting to learn more, read Game Informer's Analogue Pocket review.

There are vacuum tubes mounted on one wall, doors to either side, and a ladder leading further down into darkness.
You click one of the doors and the perspective switches over slide-projector style to a second room with identical proportions. There are pipes emerging from the floor, here, and some kind of antique radio on a pedastel in the centre. Hang on, I know this place. I know this formless sense of dread. I know these machinations. The last time I set foot here, it was 2009 and I was running a Flash game blog, writing up choice submissions to sites like Kongregate. This is Submachine, a 14-part escape puzzle series from Mateusz Skutnik, which Skutnik has now compiled, polished-up and re-released as Submachine: Legacy.

From the Minecraft Live footage this weekend, Trial Chambers look like an evolution of the game's old buried fortresses, with some nifty new flourishes in the shape of copper bulb blocks that slowly give off less and less light, and new Trial Spawners, which generate a certain number of hostile mobs based on things like the number of players in your party.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The EGX demo for magic school adventure Leximan was perhaps only ten minutes long, but that's all it really needed to confirm that this wordy spell-caster is a riotous delight of a thing that should absolutely be on your radar. Built out of a game jam prototype from 2020, Leximan casts you (sorry) as a would-be wizard who's struggling to make an impact compared to his more verbally proficient schoolmates. In this particular demo, he's woken by a friend to go and assist the school cook with preparing breakfast, but things go horribly awry when a pesky fire elemental turns up to spoil it all.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'll admit I've been a bit sceptical of Loco Motive since it was first announced a little while ago. Any point and click adventure game that makes a bid trying to be funny like the good old days has a very real chance of being painfully unfunny in my experience (looking at you, Deponia), and I was worried that Loco Motive would fall into the same try-hard pile as other so-called comedy adventures that have come out recently (see also Turnip Boy - yeah, I went there, fight me). But having played a timed 20-minute demo of it at this year's EGX, I'll hold my hands up and say, yep, I'm the one who's been slapped in the face with a giant custard pie here, as Loco Motive is genuinely really quite good, folks, and I'm pleased to report the good old days are still very much alive and kicking. Well, except poor old Lady Unterwald, who carks it within seconds of the game starting, and whose murder you end up getting framed for.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I see dirt, I know what I must do: clean. Whether it's in my own, real-life home or in a game, I am compelled to scrub, wipe and tidy - and the oily, purple globs of gunk clogging up Loddlenaut's appropriately named region of Flotsam Flats are just begging to be zapped by my little diver's handy laser gun. With just a single squeeze of the trigger, he sets to work, moving his arm automatically to neatly attack each neighbouring blob without any further prompting or manual aiming. All I need to focus on is getting him close enough to the gunge and he'll take care of the rest. Sure, it's perhaps not quite as involved as your PowerWash Sims and other polish em ups, but the combination of Loddlenaut's lo-fi visuals, comforting score and surprisingly soothing controller rumble all work to give it its own kind of zen-like charm - and it was enough to make me forget the surrounding din of the EGX Rezzed Zone for a very enjoyable 20 minutes or so.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo revealed in August that longtime Mario voice actor Charles Martinet would no longer be voicing Mario. Amongst speculation of a different voice actor for Mario in Super Mario Bros. Wonder trailers, Nintendo also announced Martinet was not jumpman's voice in the game, leaving fans to wonder who the new voice is. After months of internet sleuthing, guesswork, and more, Nintendo has confirmed that Genshin Impact voice actor Kevin Afghani is the new voice of Mario. 
"The voice actor's name is Kevin Afghani," Nintendo tells Game Informer in a statement.
Afghani celebrated the news with a tweet today about how excited he is to voice both Mario and Luigi in Super Mario Bros. Wonder. 
Incredibly proud to have voiced Mario and Luigi in Super Mario Bros. Wonder. Thanks to Nintendo for inviting me into the Flower Kingdom!
October 13, 2023
Afghani's credits include Arnold in the aforementioned Genshin Impact, Raditz in Dragon Ball R&R, and Short Detective, General, and Grunt in the Secret History of Cuphead short.
Super Mario Bros. Wonder hits Switch exclusively on October 20. Ahead of its release, Mario graced the cover of the latest issue of Game Informer, and we've been diving deep into the making of the game and more in our exclusive Super Mario Bros. Wonder coverage hub. Here are some of the stories you can find in it:

Both offer co-op and competitive multiplayer options. Both deliver modernized visuals. And both give players new gameplay concepts and abilities that expand the original franchise vision in unprecedented ways. However, perhaps the most shocking thing these two games have in common is when they release.
In the 1990s, Sonic the Hedgehog was the sole series able to briefly challenge Mario's claim to the platforming throne, and next week may prove the series' fates are forever intertwined.

There are 1,320 reviews at the time of writing, and they are Mostly Negative, which is quite the showing for a game's first day on sale.

You drive a selection of vehicles across an increasingly ludicrous desert while everything in the universe tries to stop you. But you have guns. Or flamethrowers.

After 2006's Mortal Kombat: Armageddon seemingly concluded the franchise's main narrative, 2011's entry picked up the bloody pieces. It moved the saga forward by resetting the timeline, serving as a soft reboot that brought Mortal Kombat back to its 2D fighting roots and ushering in the return of the classic roster. MK 9's cinematic story mode served as an epiphany for the series and fighting games as a whole, establishing the blueprint for narrative fighting campaigns still utilized today. MK9's story also serves as the first chapter of the modern trilogy of games that Mortal Kombat 1 builds upon. For a whole lot more on MK9 and its development, you can read this feature on how the reboot saved the franchise.
Join editors Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard as they battle their way through MK 9 to see how its reimagined tournament holds up.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The next game in RGG Studio’s Yakuza/Like A Dragon series, Infinite Wealth, is a melting pot of old and new. As the bare buttocks of returning Yakuza: Like A Dragon hero Ichiban Kasuga indicated in the reveal trailer for Infinite Wealth, we’re not in Yokohama anymore, but Honolulu, Hawaii. He’s not alone on his journey either. As well as his mates from the first LAD, plus lots more newcomers, mainline Yakuza stablemate Kazuma Kiryu, now extra frosty with his silver hairdo, is also coming along for the ride as well. 
Alas, the circumstances in which the two join forces wasn’t covered in my 30-minute demo at this year’s EGX. Rather, we pick up Ichiban, Kiryu and fresh faces Chitose and Tomizawa as they land in Honolulu, in search of a dodgy cop named Roman who's managed to wrong almost everyone in the group at some point in the past. 30 minutes isn’t long in a game like Yakuza, but hey, I still got to screech at restaurant goers in one of its sidequest stories, as well as terrorise the general public on Ichiban’s always-deployable segway, which I’d still call a pretty strong introduction to this latest LAD.

One of Superstars’ biggest selling points is to take down Eggman with up to three other players. Unfortunately, co-op is restricted to local play. Living alone and working remotely makes couch co-op a tricky proposition, and the only way for me to test this is by using the PS5’s Share Play feature with another editor, but that feature won’t work until the game launches next Tuesday. Until I can get a sense of what it’s like to take down badniks with another person, my general thoughts on Sonic Superstars is that if you’re looking for a Genesis-era throwback, Sonic Team and Arzest have nailed it …]]></summary>

The CMA was the last hurdle for Microsoft's acquisition after it received approval in more than 40 countries and regions, including the U.S. earlier this summer. The deadline for Microsoft to close this deal was October 18, but reports indicated the company was planning to finalize it today, October 13. That has now happened, and Activision Blizzard is officially part of Xbox's first-party studio umbrella.

Time to get busy, then. The cows need to be milked, the eggs need to be gathered from the chicken coop, the seeds need to be sowed and watered. 


You might find an hour to do a bit of scavenging, here and there - gathering mussels from the rocks at low tide, or putting aside some wood for that pier your dad asked you to build. Just, don't forget the gods. The gods have needs too. Today it's crabs. Tomorrow? Who knows.

But it's not alone; the Legend of Zelda series, which started around that time, also remains a genre leader all these decades later. During our discussions with Nintendo during our Super Mario Bros. Wonder cover story (and other interviews earlier this year), we tried to drill into why these franchises – in particular, the Mario franchise – have maintained their popularity and level of quality while so many other series have struggled to hold onto it for even a fraction of the time.

It is not the ultimate Star Trek strategy game, but nor is it a bog standard 4X strategy in an unfortunate 80s leotard. "Lets you play your own Star Trek story" is a fair summary of what it's about, even if the bulk of that story in practical terms is building space stations to claim territory, and filling up planets with farms, cities, and empire-specific labour camps, forums, and whatever hippie garbage the feds have. Of course, it has the advantage of riding the coattails of already-established fiction and maybe that's cheating a little, but the result is a sort of grand 4X that in most regards I've enjoyed more the longer I played it.

The game's first story DLC expansion, Haus, amps up the weirdness of the environments by transporting you to a "surreal, psycho-horror dreamscape" in blissful Malibu.
There are flashes of Glass Onion and The Menu here, but I was reminded just as much of the eerier parts of Bioshock, that underwater monument to crackpot billionaires with far too much time on their hands. Here's a video of the opening.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lords Of The Fallen is a reboot of CI Games and Deck 13's 2014 action-RPG called… Lords Of The Fallen. We thought the original was average and largely forgettable, so how does the new LOTF stack up against it nine years later? Well, it's definitely going to appeal to more folks by being a fairly enjoyable soulslike that ticks most checkboxes, and that rises above most of the competition by popping a magic lantern in your hands.
Raise a light to the dark fantasy world and it'll reveal a more dribbly parallel universe you can warp between at almost any time. This spooky lantern might open up some cool realm-hopping twists on your grim adventure, and the game as a whole might instil a sense of exploration sure to please souls fans after a familiar hit of uncertain peril, but its finer details chip away at your patience. It's not long before your tentative pushes through horrible towns and creaky walkways soon give way to wild sprint finishes born from pure frustration.

Lords of the Fallen captured my interest in its early hours more than its 2014 predecessor of the same name ever did. But despite a solid gameplay foundation, stunning world, and unique two-realm mechanic, by the time I reached credits after 48 hours, I was overjoyed to be done. What begins as a remarkable soft reboot unravels by the halfway point due to pacing issues, abundant repetition, and lackluster level design, unfortunately leaving a disappointing back half to slog through. 
Lords of the Fallen begins like any other Soulslike. The world – …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Assassin's Creed Mirage hit PlayStation, Xbox, and PC last week and both critics and fans alike are quite happy with the series return to its roots. Unlike Assassin's Creed Origins, Odyssey, and Valhalla, in which Basim is featured, Mirage is a smaller, more condensed adventure, unlike the prior open-world RPGs. Now, roughly a week later, Ubisoft has revealed that Mirage's player count is in line with Origins and Odyssey. Plus, Mirage is Ubisoft's biggest new-gen launch in terms of sales. 
Thank you all for joining us on Basim's journey in 9th Century Baghdad!

October 11, 2023
Alongside the news, Ubisoft revealed some fun statistics about what Mirage players have accomplished in just six days: 
479 collective years spent parkouring the rooftops of Baghdad
60 million Leaps of Faith
1.2 million street cats pet
"With the number of players in line with past successful launches such as Assassin's Creed Origins and Assassin's Creed Odyssey, we are humbled by the positive reception," Ubisoft's statement reads. "We are proud to also share that Assassin's Creed Mirage is the biggest New Gen launch in terms of units sales to date at Ubisoft (PS5, Xbox Series X/S). A big congratulations to the Bordeaux Studio and all its partners in the project for this accomplishment." 


We had a great time with the game, and you can read about why in Game Informer's Assassin's Creed Mirage review. If you're still playing, or are planning to jump in soon, be sure to read Game Informer's Assassin's Creed Mirage tips and tricks. Read our interview with Basim voice actor Lee Majdoub after that.

Having founded it in 2006 in Osaka, Japan, later working on games like Bayonetta and The Wonderful 101, he left his reason for leaving up in the air. He simply said, "This came after a lot of consideration based on my own beliefs" and that he feels "this outcome is for the best." Now, just a few weeks later, Kamiya has started a YouTube channel – aptly called "Hideki Kamiya Channel" – and in his first video, he reveals he's not retiring, as first reported by VideoGamesChronicle.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Whereas most games begin by getting you into the action as quickly as possible, Saltsea Chronicles opens with a quick note about its save system. It's a small, but important detail in this story-driven adventure game, as throughout its nine-to-ten-hour run time, you'll be faced with various decisions about where your crew of post-apocalyptic drifters will explore next, as they set sail in search of their missing captain Maja. By choosing one island at the end of every chapter, you'll naturally miss out on visiting another - and with 14 locales to explore in total in the Saltsea archipelago (and only 12 chapters to do it in), each playthrough has the potential to end up being quite different from the last.
But up front it tells you "There are no wrong choices, only your choices" in Saltsea Chronicles, and that ultimately this is a tale about "tracing different pathways" using its clever branching save system. While you can, of course, play it through from start to finish in a single swoop, you also have the option to purloin its additional save slots to take those roads less travelled (presented here as delightful, wiggling seaweed tendrils), and all without overwriting your existing adventure. Immediately, that sense of FOMO is dispelled, and instead of worrying about 'seeing everything' or making sure you get a 'good' playthrough, you can simply enjoy its enthralling tale of high seas soap opera, curious exploration, and the knotty drama that comes with trying to forge connections in an increasingly fragmented world. It's a journey well worth taking, even if what lies at the end of it didn't quite come together in the way I'd hoped.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dead Island 2 is getting its first story expansion dubbed Haus. The adventure whisks players to new locations to take on a mysterious cult while surviving that pesky zombie apocalypse. 
This new storyline centers on techno-death cults hosted by its crazed leader, Konstantin, who believes such battles are the "paragon of the future." The adventure unfolds in a Malibu villa, described in a press release as a "deranged labyrinth of biomes where rational architecture is subverted by expanding narrative spaces."


Your guess is as good as ours as to what that means, but Haus features eight new cards and new weapons, such as the long-ranged K-Rossbow and the flame-spewing Hog Roaster. Developer Dambuster Studios has not posted a trailer but did release a few screenshots that you can view below.

Dead Island 2 Haus launches on November 2. You can read our review of the base game here, and be sure to check out our deep-dive feature on the development of Yager Interactive's scrapped version of Dead Island 2.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you’re a PlayStation Plus Premium subscriber, you’re getting a new perk in the ability to stream select native PS5 games starting this month. Cloud streaming will be available for supported titles within the PS Plus Game Catalog, game trials, and personal user libraries. 
The PlayStation Blog post details the select PS5 titles that support the feature include Ghost of Tsushima, Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales, Horizon: Forbidden West, Mortal Kombat 11, and Saints Row IV. Additionally, you can stream game trials for Hogwarts Legacy, The Calisto Protocol, and The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, to name some. DLC and add-ons will also be available to stream. 


Games streamed over the cloud will output up to 4K 60 fps (depending on your internet speed), and feature full DualSense and Tempest 3D audio support. Sony states that it plans to have "hundreds" of titles support this feature in the future. 
Sony is gradually rolling out cloud streaming across Japan, Europe, and North America on the following dates:
Japan – October 17
Europe – October 23
North America – October 30
As a reminder, Premium is the most expensive of the three PS Plus subscription tiers, even more so after Sony raised annual membership prices last month. While cloud streaming's mileage varies based on internet quality, it could be a nifty perk for members. If you're a Premium subscriber, will you be taking advantage of cloud streaming?

It also became the blueprint for nearly every 3D platformer for the next several years. Super Mario 64 looked amazing in motion, but more importantly, it played like a dream. To say it revolutionized gaming would be an understatement. 
In 2002, Nintendo released Super Mario Sunshine on GameCube to critical and fan acclaim.

Amazon's Prime Big Deal Days kicks that tendency into overdrive, with Keychron's V3 TKL keyboard dropping from $90 to $60. 
That's a fantastic price for a keyboard that sports features normally seen on custom keyboards: hot-swappable switches, QMK/VIA programmable firmware and gorgeous double-shot PBT keycaps.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Once you've finished screaming, let me re-emphasise that this story is one of those "according to report" stories. It comes from unnamed sources at Activision-Blizzard, describing a recent all-hands meeting during which CEO Bobby Kotick laid out his vision for the company and gaming at large following Activison's acquisition by Microsoft, which is tipped to finally conclude this week. Amongst other things, Kotick allegedly discussed machine learning, Guitar Hero and the apocalyptic power of Microsoft R&D. Activision hired James Corden to host the meeting, the sources claim. It sounds like a David Lynch fever dream.

Because, for lower-end and mid-range builds especially, do you truly need any other CPU cooler? The Hyper 212 Evo V2 near-perfectly  balances simplicity, effectiveness, and affordability; it’s like the PC component equivalent of Charles Eames’ museum-beloved leg splint, only less stackable. More to the point, it’s down to £33 in the Amazon Prime Big Deal Days sale, equalling its lowest price of 2023 thus far.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ara: History Untold's headline gimmick is actually a couple of centuries old. In this deceptively Civilization-esque 4X strategy game, all player turns unfold simultaneously, once you've decided what to build or research, where to move your units, and so on. As Oxide Games design director Michelle Menard tells me over Zoom, this approach takes inspiration from an ancient military simulator, Kriegsspiel, which was devised by the Prussian army officer George Leopold von Reisswitz, aka the "father of wargaming", in the mid-1800s. 


"It was to train their generals, it was a legit apparatus of war, it was not for funsies," says Menard. "And they basically created this massive table that had a modular terrain system. At first they used sand, but that was kind of messy, [and so] they developed a system where they had interchangeable tiles, like hills and valleys and plateaus. 


"They would build out this table, literally drop a sheet down the middle, and it'd be like, OK, you guys on each side, you can't see what the other person's doing. There was an actual game master, who was the referee who you would report your moves to. He would then re-set up the board and basically call people back into the room and be like, tada! It's the next turn - let's see what people did. Was it what you expected?"

With reports indicating that the deal is set to close tomorrow, on October 13, the saga is almost over. Ahead of that deal's finalization, we learned Activision Blizzard will not be putting the upcoming Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III or the recently released Diablo IV on Xbox Game Pass this year. Now, thanks to a new report from WindowsCentral, we've learned Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick held an all-hands employee meeting yesterday where former late-night show host James Corden interviewed him about future technology, the acquisition, and Guitar Hero.

They can also make already-affordable kit even more of a bargain, as is the case with the Logitech G413 SE mechanical keyboard: a snip at £60. 


This has been on our best gaming keyboards list for a while now, specifically for delivering all the satisfying finger-feel (and durability) of a true mechanical board with a pricing that puts it closer to high-end membrane and hybrid switch models. The G413 SE employs the bumpy 'tactile' style of mech switches, so it’s good for accurate typing, and it’s easily fast and agile enough for gaming duty as well. I actually ended up using this as my main keyboard for a while, despite having more expensive linear-switch boards piled up in a nearby cupboard, and I’d extra-extra-recommend it at this price.

The trigger is this year's Minecraft Mob Vote, a community ballot to decide which of three creatures will be added to the game. Many Minecrafters feel the Mob Vote (which has extended to potential new Minecraft biomes in the past) is needlessly parsimonious, and cynically divisive: given Mojang's current headcount and Microsoft's resources, why not add all three mobs to the game, rather than asking players to do battle over scraps? And now, those players are trying to shut the whole thing down.

The challenge ahead is to suppress pirate IPTV and streaming sites, the latter of which coincidentally hit the mainstream roughly 12 years ago.

        <id>121308</id>
        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2023/10/10/sony-announces-new-slim-playstation-5-models-with-removable-disc-drives"/>
        <updated>2023-10-10T16:27:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nearly three years after the initial launch of the PlayStation 5, Sony has revealed a slimmer redesign. Both the disc drive model and the digital model will be updated, but these two models aren't as different as they used to be: you will now be able to purchase a disc drive separately, allowing you to upgrade a digital model to a disc-compatible version. Both versions will be available this November, and will eventually replace the current model of PS5 altogether.
"The new PS5 has been reduced in volume by more than 30%, and weight by 18% and 24% compared to the previous models," the PlayStation blog post reads. It also mentions that the new covers have different textures, which isn't immediately clear from the pictures. "There are four separate cover panels," it says, "with the top portion in a glossy look, while the bottom remains in matte." This does raise questions about the compatibility of console shells Sony currently sells that allow you to change the look of your console, but this question is not addressed in the announcement.
The slim PS5 with a disc drive will still cost $499.99. The PS5 digital edition retails at $449.99, a $50 increase from the original digital edition. 
If you do buy a newer digital version and decide to upgrade it to a disc version, the drive will cost you $79.99 in the US, €119.99 in Europe, £99.99 in the UK, and ¥11,980 in Japan. The total cost of a digital console and a disc drive is a little more expensive than buying a disc drive version outright. The console will include a new horizontal stand to set the console on its side, and a vertical stand will be on sale for $29.99 USD | 29.99 EURO | 24.99 GBP | 3,980 JPY. You can watch the reveal trailer below:

        <updated>2023-10-10T14:23:32.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft revealed its "fast-paced firefights meets punk rock mosh pits" first-person shooter, Tom Clancy's XDefiant, in 2021. It's a free-to-play shooter that features factions from different Ubisoft properties, like Splinter Cell, Watch Dogs, The Division, and Far Cry. We went hands-on with XDefiant earlier this year and came away impressed with the shooter. Players enjoyed an open beta back in June, and the full game was set to launch in the summer, but now, developer Ubisoft San Francisco has delayed its preseason launch indefinitely. 
The team announced this on Twitter yesterday, revealing that the recent Public Test Session was a success but highlighted some inconsistencies in the game experience it wants to address before the preseason launch. As such, the preseason launch has been delayed to a later unspecified date. 
Here's Ubisoft's full statement on the XDefiant preseason launch delay: 
An update on XDefiant- pic.twitter.com/3orSnspmp6
October 9, 2023
As you can see, Ubisoft doesn't indicate when to expect the Preseason launch to happen, making this an indefinite delay. 
In the meantime, watch Game Informer's XDefiant New Gameplay Today and then read our XDefiant impressions after going hands-on with the game earlier this year.

        <updated>2023-10-10T14:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sometimes, when I’m winning a Total War battle handily, I like to pick an absolutely haggard group of low-tier hopelesses and spend the rest of the fight zoomed in on them, narrativising their high-stakes struggles in a rich and velvety internal monologue that monopolises my attention so fully that I more or less ignore the rest of the battle. That these are among my absolute favourite Total War moments may say something about the level of satisfaction to be found elsewhere in the series’ strategy sandboxes, at times as robust as ancient oaks, others as stale as ancient wotsits. It may be an admission on both our parts that, for all its simulated complexity, Total War is really for people who’d be just as happy playing with those little elasticated catapults and plastic castles, if we could still sit on the floor without our pelvises crumbling into soup mix.  


Total War: Pharaoh, which I will acknowledge once and once only as being officially stylised PHARAOH, is almost certainly the most systemically interesting and quality-of-life-full a Total War game has been at launch for a very long time. Three Kingdoms has better diplomacy, Warhammer has unequivocally better goblins, but none are as refreshingly cavalier and passionately thorough with the blueprint of what Total War has the potential to be. CA Sofia should be immensely proud of what they’ve done here, but the realities of Total War’s ridiculous release schedule now clearly mean that even a studio as willing and able to innovate so much in such a short time frame are effectively prevented from producing a genuinely exciting strategy game. I’d love to tell you these new plastic castles are more fun than your old ones, but there’s not even any catapults.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Almost two years ago, Microsoft announced it was acquiring Activision Blizzard for a colossal $69 billion. Reports say the acquisition deal is expected to close this week and Xbox players are anticipating the addition of Activision Blizzard games to the Game Pass lineup. However, a new tweet by Activision Blizzard makes it sound like the company's games won't hit the subscription service until next year. Plus, Activision Blizzard says it won't be adding the upcoming Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III or the recently released Diablo IV to Game Pass this year.
Here's what Activision Blizzard said in a tweet posted yesterday: 
It’s awesome to see anticipation building for Call of Duty®: Modern Warfare® III. As we continue to work toward regulatory approval of the Microsoft deal, we’ve been getting some questions whether our upcoming and recently launched games will be available via Game Pass.
October 9, 2023
Diablo IV launched back in June and we had a great time with it. You can read about why in Game Informer's Diablo IV review. For more about Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III, check out Game Informer's preview here and then read up on the biggest Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III news from last week's Call of Duty Next livestream.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Meta may have spent the last couple of years tumbling down a metaverse rabbit hole, but the company is still responsible for creating the best VR hardware around. The Meta Quest 2 was the ideal gaming VR package: powerful and accessible enough to provide easy, convincing immersion, while also staying highly affordable. Nonetheless, Meta’s sudden fixation on creating a legless version of Second Life did have me worried about the future trajectory of its VR hardware. What daft gimmickry would their next headset come festooned with, and what would it mean for the future of the Quest as a gaming device?


With the Meta Quest 3, we have the answer. And the truth is, Meta’s latest headset does have a whiff of Metaverse about it. Dubbed a "mixed reality" device, its raison d’être is to break down the barrier between reality and the virtual world. While mixed reality is an angle I’m not wholly sold on from a gaming perspective, crucially, the features that make it a mixed reality device are useful even if you don’t want to hold a meeting in your office with a bunch of bisected Sims. Moreover, they’re built into a headset that is more powerful, more comfortable, and generally better than the Meta Quest 2.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Much like a Call of Duty player inching up the stairs behind a wily sniper, Microsoft are closing in on final, final approval of their multi-billion purchase of Activision Blizzard, having more-or-less won over the UK's competition and markets authority. The company expect to bring it home by 13th October.
Aside from hastening the arrival of a grim future that consists of a giant, mechanised Phil Spencer engaged in a trans-Pacific staring contest with Nintendo, this also means we can expect new and recent behemoths like Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 and Diablo 4 on Microsoft's Game Pass subscription service.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Unity CEO John Riccitiello has announced that he’s retiring from the company effective immediately. The news comes almost a month after the company announced plans to introduce a controversial install fee for developers, which resulted in an industry-wide backlash.
Riccitiello is stepping down as CEO, president, and a member of the board of directors. In a press release, Unity states that James M. Whitehurst will take over as interim CEO while the board seeks a permanent replacement. Whitehurst is a tech veteran who served as president at IBM from 2008 to 2020 and as a senior advisor from 2021 to 2022.

Wonder was met with many excited reactions; the art direction, the music, and the new enemies all looked like fun evolutions of what fans had grown accustomed to in the New Super Mario Bros. series. However, it was the final shot of the trailer that garnered the biggest reaction, as Mario grabbed an odd-looking fruit and turned into a massive elephant version of himself. Elephant Mario, who appears larger than life on our current cover art, quickly became one of the most recognizable elements of Super Mario Bros. Wonder.
Players won't need to wait long to play as Elephant Mario, as it appears in the very first stage, Welcome to the Flower Kingdom. The Elephant Fruit emerges out of a block, and true to the trailer, Mario transforms into this new for…]]></summary>

The headsets have not been without their growing pains, but the path from Rift to Quest has been generally smooth, and the iterations have always added worthy improvements. Meta Quest 3 continues along that path to deliver what is, by a large margin, my favorite VR headset, but it doesn’t fix all the problems the medium continues to face.

Nearly six months later, that date has arrived: Performance Mode is now live in Redfall. 
Publisher Bethesda's patch notes about today's Redfall update don't specify how exactly this Performance Mode works, but presumably, it runs the game at 60 FPS. This update also brings some heavily requested features to Arkane as well, including stealth takedowns, more accessibility options, multiplayer communication improvements,…]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-10-06T16:31:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft's long journey to acquire gaming giant Activision Blizzard is finally nearing an end. According to The Verge, a source familiar with Microsoft's plans indicated that it was aiming for Friday, October 13, as a date to close the deal. Ignoring the infamy of the date (it seems Microsoft and Activision Blizzard executives aren't very superstitious), it's not a surprising day to choose. Back in July, the two parties in the deal jointly agreed to extend the deadline of their agreement to October 18 in order to sort out any further regulatory concerns. At the time of publishing, that date is only twelve days away, so the deal would have to be closed soon.
Still, the Microsoft legal department will have to deal with a few more legal challenges before they're completely out of the woods. After restructuring the terms of the merger to grant Ubisoft the rights to stream Activision Blizzard games in the UK, the Competition and Markets Authority granted the deal a preliminary approval, but the regulator still has to make a final assessment sometime before October 18. Still, Microsoft and Activision Blizzard each took this as a major win.
We are encouraged by this positive development in the CMA’s review process. We presented solutions that we believe fully address the CMA’s remaining concerns related to cloud game streaming, and we will continue to work toward earning approval to close prior to the October 18…
September 22, 2023
This news followed the companies' victory over the Federal Trade Commission back in July. At this point, it seems fairly likely that the deal will go through, ending a saga that began almost two years ago. After documents from the hearings leaked and revealed Microsoft's hybrid console, a new Xbox model, and plans to acquire other companies like Sega and Bungie, Microsoft is probably ready to leave the entire matter behind it.

In his tweet, he writes that "Telltale laid most of us off in early September," and that the layoffs occurred weeks after the company acquired U.K.-based studio, Flavourworks, which developed Erica. 
This is a sore subject, but I feel it necessary to add to the gaming layoff news: Telltale laid most of us off early September. Status of TWAU2, I can't say (NDA).

Telltale has now confirmed to Game Informer that layoffs at the studio did occur, although its official statement features no mention of just how many employees were let go. The statement doesn't mention severance for laid-off employees, but Huang notes on Twitter that he…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dredge was a delightful indie surprise when it launched earlier this year, but if it left you wanting more spooky ship survival, you're in luck. The Pale Reach is Dredge's first DLC, and it launches in just over a month. For more on The Pale Reach, check out the reveal trailer below.


Set in icy waters, the DLC will include "1-3 hours of content" and is accessible at any point during a playthrough of the game. In addition to a new side story, the expansion will add 11 more fish and crab species to the world of Dredge, allow you to craft a ship add-on to break through small icebergs in the water, and add ice blocks to extend the shelf-life of some of your catches. The trailer also features new monsters, like a massive icy crab and a four-legged narwhal-like creature. The Pale Reach will be available to purchase on November 16, and Dredge is available on all major platforms. 
For more Dredge, check out this episode of the GI show. Then, read about how the game's publisher, Team17, announced a wave of layoffs this week along with the departure of its CEO Michael Pattison.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Cyberpunk franchise has been on a winning streak lately. From the acclaimed anime Cyberpunk: Edgerunners to the 2.0 update of 2077 and the release of Phantom Liberty, public perception of the series has largely turned around. Today, CD Projekt Red announced that they're taking the next step with the franchise – creating a live-action production.
The game studio is partnering with Anonymous Content, a media company known for its work on shows like Mr. Robot and films like The Revenant. The project will be produced by Garrett Kemble, David Levine, Ryan Schwartz, Bard Dorros, and Charlie Scully, who will develop the project "in close collaboration with the Cyberpunk 2077 creative team." That said, this is still in the earliest stages; there's still no screenwriter attached to the project.
There are still many questions in the air about the project. They've yet to announce (and perhaps, decide) whether it will be a film or a series. And while the project is "set in the world" of Cyberpunk 2077, there are a lot of approaches they could take. No actors have been attached to the project either, so whether Keanu Reeves or Idris Elba will show up is still up in the air. You can read the full press release here.
For more Cyberpunk, here's what we thought of the latest expansion, Phantom Liberty, and here's a list of tips and tricks to help you get started. After that, check out this feature to learn about lessons CD Projekt Red learned from the launch of Cyberpunk 2077.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dark Side, the exciting sequel of the groundbreaking Driller, is ready for public testing!
Dark Side, like its predecessor, was released by Incentive Software Limited in 1988, shortly after Driller. The updated gameplay features a jetpack that allows you to leave the ground, providing a new and fresh perspective that emphasizes the excitement and challenges of exploring Tricuspid, the second alien moon of planet Evath.
This time, the vicious Ketars have scattered and hidden Energy Collection Devices (ECD) around their base to destroy your home planet. It’s up to you to destroy them first! The tricky part is many ECDs are connected to each other and can regenerate instantly, so you must figure out the right order to successfully complete your mission. 
Our reimplementation of the Freescape engine features graphics using software (TinyGL) or hardware mode (OpenGL) at arbitrary resolution. The initial Dark Side support includes DOS (EGA/CGA modes), ZX Spectrum and Amstrad CPC. Additionally, there are two playable demos if you want to test the game. Support for Amiga and AtariST will be available later! Please contact us if you have some other release.
To play any of these supported releases, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker.
