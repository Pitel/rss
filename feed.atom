A special Nintendo Direct Mini: Partner Showcase is airing later today in the UK, and of course, the rumours have already started.

It's been long enough since I finished Elden Ring that I no longer remember many of the controls, which is a good place for me to be — it means I'll be able to revisit the game with relatively fresh eyes sooner than later. After marathoning it, I'm excited to play again at a slower pace, and a recent discovery shared on Reddit has hyped me up even more.
For those of you who aren't done with Elden Ring yet, let's just say that a certain important late-game area can be spotted right from the beginning. It's one of those things that's easily overlooked even if you know what you're looking for and have the full context.

Now there's a soiree full of suspects and locations to investigate to find out who did the dirty deed in Murder at Castle Nathria.


Murder at Castle Nathria has three key aspects to the set, including a couple of new mechanics to the digital card game. First are ten Legendary Suspects, new legendary minions with one representing each Hearthstone class. These legends include fishy detective Murloc Holmes which allows you to copy cards from your opponent's deck by guessing three questions about cards in their hand or deck correctly and Decim…]]></summary>

Multiplayer platformer royale Fall Guys went free-to-play last week, with its first free season and a new model launching across new and old platforms. A lot of players have been dipping back in, or jumping on for the first time. But some Fall Guys fans, especially long-time players, seem frustrated with the changes made to its monetization model.
Prior to the free-to-play launch, Mediatonic's competitive game-show-style platformer Fall Guys was a one-time buy game. With the move to free-to-play, the model has shifted from using Crowns (wins) and Kudos (general currency) to purchase shop items. Now, Crowns go towards a separate, smaller cosmetic track.

Every so often, I jump into a could-go-either-way indie game knowing just a basic bullet point or two. In the case of Fobia - St. Dinfna Hotel, a survival horror game from Brazilian studio Pulsatrix, that lack of exposure ended up leading to an overall pleasant surprise.
To quickly catch you up to speed: this game has undeniable shades of Resident Evil 7's first-person horror and inventory management, with a huge emphasis on solving puzzles, and there's a surprisingly deep story to unfurl as you slink around an infested hotel.
I may have gotten extremely lost — twice! — but it all worked out in the end.

One of Steam's popular new releases this week is a parody of The Witness, and whether you liked that game or ended up bouncing off it, there's fun to be had. The Looker goes to surprisingly great lengths to capture that island-exploring puzzle-solving experience, except it's much more concise — above all, it just wants to make you laugh. Also, it's free!
I think it's something anyone could enjoy, but you'll likely appreciate it more if you've cracked far enough into The Witness to know that it's not just a typical "puzzle game."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During its annual Spark 2022 conference, Tencent Games unveiled Code: To Jin Yong, a new open-world action title steeped in wuxia literature and created in Unreal Engine 5.
The upcoming game comes from LightSpeed Studio, a Chinese team most notable for developing Apex Legends Mobile and PUBG Mobile. Code: To Jin Yong is an adaptation of a series of wuxia (a genre of fantasy martial arts) novels by acclaimed author Jin Yong, whose works have been extremely popular in China since the 1950s. The game features heroes from Yong’s novels and leverages Unreal 5’s power, such as photogrammetry technology, to create dazzling martial arts combat and physics that fans of wuxia films should appreciate. Check out the gameplay demo below to see it in action. 


Code: To Jin Yong has no release date or confirmed platforms, but Tencent’s press release states it will be available globally “in the near future.” What do you think of this first look at the title? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

Online games can be a ton of fun, especially when you're getting along with your team and playing well together. What makes multiplayer experiences unbearable, though, are the players who are hellbent on making everyone else's lives miserable. The studios behind multiplayer games, like Riot, have been doing everything they can to make sure a few toxic players don't ruin it for everyone else, and now they're taking even further steps to make sure everyone can play in peace.
Riot published a blog post on Valorant's website back in February addressing players' concerns about toxic players, and that post referenced greater monitoring on voice chat, which is much more difficult to oversee than text. They're finally moving forward with th…]]></summary>

Bernie Stolar, former president of Sony Computer Entertainment America and Sega of America, has passed away. The sad news was first announced by Stolar's friends before being verified by news outlet Gamesbeat. He was 75.
Stolar, who first entered the video game industry in 1980, had a stellar career that saw him work alongside multiple gaming giants, often being a key figure in the conception, licensing, and release of some landmark hardware. Getting his break with Atari, Stolar would play a key role in the company's coin-op division, before eventually transitioning to lead developer on the company's handheld console, Atari Lynx.
Later in the 1990s, Stolar would be a founding member of Sony Computer Entertainment America, operating as vice presi…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jane Foster takes to the fray tomorrow
The Mighty Thor, the latest hero to join the battle in Marvel's Avengers, arrives tomorrow. Before her launch, Crystal Dynamics has published a gameplay deep dive exploring just how this Mighty Thor is familiar and not-so-familiar for Marvel's Avengers players.
The War Table deep dive posted this morning showcases Jane Foster's specific set of moves. In the Marvel's Avengers continuum, Foster is brought over from another timeline, one where Thor Odinson gave up the hammer.
With Foster as the new wielder of Mjolnir, her moves may look a little familiar. But there are some differences that make the Mighty Thor a bit different.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxjz6fFQSJc
The video highlights Jane's combo abilities, which can create shockwaves as she hits or adds a catch-and-release mechanic to Mjolnir. Her big move looses Mjolnir on enemies, letting it fly around and pummel foes as she summons another weapon, Undrjarn. Twice the bludgeoning seems like bad news for the bad guys.
Mightiest heroes
While the side-by-side comparisons early on don't help Jane feel all too different from Thor, the later abilities do seem to offer a different and distinct playstyle. The visual design of the Mighty Thor is fantastic too; Foster will get her own cosmetics, and they really lean into some fantastic armor and garb.
In today's accompanying blog, Crystal Dynamics also confirms it's working on more content for Marvel's Avengers. Two new challenges will continue to push the narrative efforts forward, with the first being a villain-focused Warzone.
It's a good reaffirmation of what's in store for Marvel's Avengers for anyone wondering what would happen to the project since Square Enix struck the deal with Embracer. Seems like support is still ongoing, at least for the near future. And in the even-nearer future, the Mighty Thor hits Marvel's Avengers tomorrow, June 28.

It's one of those rumours that feels like it's been around for years because, well, it has, but Jeff Grubb of the Giant Bomb parish has once again gone on record with updated information regarding a Metroid Prime remaster — and this time there's even a release window attached.
As discussed by Grubb on his Game Mess Mornings show broadcast earlier today (thanks, Nintendo Everything), his sources tell him that the long-rumoured remaster is being lined up for the GameCube game's 20th anniversary. Yes, Metroid Prime will be two decades old on 18th November and Nintendo is supposedly looking to launch the game around that time. If you're wondering, 18th November 2022 is a Friday.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bean there, done that
It seems as though slapstick battle royale title Fall Guys, (previously Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout), is pulling in the punters once again — developer Mediatonic has announced that the past weekend saw the madcap multiplayer game hit a dizzying high of 20 million players, following the release of the long-time-coming Nintendo Switch and Xbox ports as well as the unlocking of Fall Guys as a free-to-play title.
"MASSIVE THANK YOU TO ALL WHO HAVE STUMBLED!" reads an enthusiastic tweet. "We reached an incredible 20 million players in the first 48 hours of Free For All ...see you this weekend my beans!"
https://twitter.com/FallGuysGame/status/1540711411629707265?s=20&t=19cTPmw-jg6FjZkakna5Jg
Originally released on PC and PlayStation back in 2020, Fall Guys quickly won over the hearts of players worldwide with its very silly but immensely compelling action. For the uninitiated, players take control of one of 60 individually controlled "beans" before competing against 59 other players in a series of fun games and challenges to be crowned the Last Bean Standing.
With simplistic controls and gameplay, a welcoming "game show" aesthetic, and an ever-growing wardrobe of silly costumes and accessories, Fall Guys enjoyed a staggeringly healthy launch period, before tapering off somewhat in 2021, though it is still very easy to find a full lobby of players ready to rumble. By adding further console ports, and unlocking the paid entry to the title, Mediatonic has clearly given its smash-hit title a fresh shot of adrenaline, ready to delight and frustrate players all over again.
Fall Guys is available now, free-to-play, on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms.

Nintendo's influence on the world of gaming surely needs little explanation; while the Japanese company didn't 'invent' video games, it has done more than most to establish many of the ground rules for the medium. It's little wonder, then, that so many companies look to Nintendo when it comes to creating their own gaming endeavours, and nowhere is that more true than in the realm of Chinese-made emulation devices.
We've already seen the likes of 8BitDo 'adapt' the iconic NES and SNES controllers for their range of Bluetooth controllers, and the PocketGo S30 (which was co-designed by a member of 8BitDo) is essentially a SNES pad with a screen and emulation powers. Now, Anbernic – arguably one of the leading forces in this field – is back with another retro-focused portable, and it basically looks like a beef-up version of the PocketGo S30. Say hello to the RG353P.

See you at @gamescom!

Ubisoft’s attendance is noteworthy because other heavy-hitters such as Nintendo, Sony, Take-Two, and Activision are skipping the show this year. Although there’s no confirmed list of attendees, THQ Nordic will also attend and plans to reveal four unannounced games. 
As for what Ubisoft has in store, we know that it plans to discuss the future of Assassin’s Creed during its own special event in September, so we probably won’t learn anything substantial about the next mainline entry at Gamescom. Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake recently shifted development teams, so it also seems unlikely to reappear. Do we see Skull & Bones, the development of which Ubisoft described as proceeding “well” earlier this year? Splinter Cell Remake? Beyond Good & Evil 2? We’ll have to tune in to find out. 
Gamescom takes place from August 24 to 28 in Cologne, Germany, at the Koelnmesse Convention Centre. The event kicks off on August 23 with Opening Night Live, the big showcase of game trailers, reveals, and announcements hosted by Geoff Keighley.]]></summary>

The devices will also be manufactured at an increased pace, so those who thought they might have to wait a while longer to pick one up may be in luck.
Valve tweeted today from its Steam Deck account that those who preordered the Steam Deck and have an expected Q3 2022 fulfillment date should check their email inboxes starting on June 30. The announcement of the latest group of preorder shipments comes paired with the reveal that Valve is increasing production of the handheld, essentially doubling the previous quarter’s output. 
“Hello! Some great news on the production front. We just sent the last batch of Q2 emails, and we’ll start sending Q3 reservation emails on the 30th,” says the @OnDeck tweet. “Production has picked up, and after today we’ll be shipping more than double the number of Steam Decks every week!”

This is excellent news for folks waiting to get their hands on a Steam Deck and might be a positive sign to those who have yet to pull the trigger on a reservation. I just got the go-ahead to purchase my Deck last week and can’t wait to get my hands on it to play all the hottest JRPGs from the ’90s and early 2000s instead of new releases like Elden Ring or DNF Duel. Who am I kidding? I’ll be playing those as well. 
If you’re curious about what the Steam Deck is all about, check out our official review of the device here and this test of 23 games on the device to see what it’s capable of playing. If you’re interested in preordering one for yourself, you can do that by slapping $5 down through the Steam client or website.]]></summary>

The Steam Deck continues to roll out to new users who can finally tinker with the handheld PC. But Valve is warning against one Steam Deck mod that recently made the rounds, due to its potential problems.
The mod in particular saw user Belly Jelly putting a 2242 M.2 NVMe solid state drive into the Steam Deck, rather than the 2230. The key difference is form factor. The 2242 is differently sized than the 2230, and as the modder noted, it did make the "heat spreader bow a tiny bit."
The mod made the rounds online, but Valve developer Lawrence Yang responded to it, asking users to please not do it.
"The charger IC gets very hot and nearby thermal pads should not be moved," Yang writes in a tweet response. "In addition, most 2242 m.2 drives draw more power and get hotter than what Deck is designed for. This mod may appear to work but will significantly shorten the life of your Deck."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dxnr2FAADAs
Not Deck Verified
Valve has warned before about the dangers of modding the Steam Deck without care, like in the video above. So yes, putting a differently sized drive than intended into the Deck seems like a bad idea.
Considering that Steam Deck orders are still gradually getting out there, it's good to have this heads up. You don't want to be the person that gets their Deck pre-order and turns it into scrap with a mod the next day.
The official dock for the Steam Deck was recently delayed, but Valve assured that has not affected the rollout of its handheld. The Verified program has also been greenlighting a bunch of games, too. Just not this particular mod.

It's fair to say that The Lord of the Rings (and by extension, The Legendarium, a catch-all term that covers J. R. R. Tolkien's Middle-earth works) is a huge part of my life. I'm writing this now listening to the soundtrack of the Peter Jackson trilogy, after having come back from a four-player session of The Lord of the Rings LCG co-op card game. Oh, and I went to a Tolkien-related academic conference this past weekend: Mythmoot 2022.
It was there that I caught up with Dr. Corey Olsen, The Tolkien Professor (more on that peculiar emphasis in a moment) to talk about his involvement with the Return to Moria game, as well as some thoughts on the upcoming Gollum project.
For hardcore Tolkien fans, Dr. Olsen needs no introduction. Bu…]]></summary>

Fans have been crying for the palatinate mischievous Mario character Waluigi to get his own game, or even just a shred more attention. The lanky rival to Luigi has only really appeared in side games to play sports or party with the rest of the Mario cast. So, for now, it's in the hands of fans to come up with something special for dear ol' Waluigi.
Japanese artist @Gaku_Kumatori has done just that, creating a fantastic new game in the process that we're sure many people would get a thrill out of. Combining Luigi's rival with the green-hatted moustachioed brother's own game — Luigi's Mansion — Gaku Kumatori has come up with the aptly-titled Waluigi's Mansion. And oh we desperately want this.

My Nintendo power users are pretty aware of the various Nintendo giveaway opps that pop up roughly each month, but it's plain to see that not everyone is going to bother to check out that site. I mean, it's My Nintendo. The program has seen a huge decline in general buzz since the company eliminated Club Nintendo (RIP), but it's still alive and kicking, and you can use platinum points to enter contests. Like this one!
It's called the "My Nintendo Summer Fun Sports Sweepstakes," and all you need to do is head here and click an "entry" button. You can enter up to three times, and each entry into the Nintendo giveaway costs 10 platinum (to a maximum of 30). It's that simple! You click the link, flick a button and drop funny money you may have not used anyway, and potentially win something on August 9, once the contest ends.
The summer My Nintendo giveaway rewards include:
An old school Mario t-shirt
A Mario Strikers soccer ball
A Mario Strikers duffle bag
A Switch Sports duffle bag
Two water bottles (Mario Strikers and Switch Sports)
As a reminder, if you want physical rewards, you can find our full Platinum Point guide here, which has been updated with details on weekly missions: bookmark it for when you need quick points for a reward. A handful of points is incredibly easy to get, as that’s basically just 15 minutes with Super Mario Run, or a quick sign-on to the 3DS or Wii U 3Shop. Also remember that any shipments are bundled together, so you can pay a flat rate for multiple items instead of paying it each time. Just know that items go out of stock on My Nintendo frequently, and some are never restocked.

The developer did not reveal the identities of the new fighters, but confirmed that the first two will arrive as paid DLC on all platforms this summer, with a further two characters dropping in winter. New stages are also incoming. In addition, Project Lumina has multiple updates set to drop throughout the year, bringing various balance tweaks, bug fixes, and other elements to further fine-tune gameplay. Examples given include improved matchmaking, training mode save states, additional custom color slots, and improved lobby options. The first of these updates will launch on June 29.

Finally, an official United States tournament was also revealed. Hosted by Eliphant, the online throwdown will be held in an online capacity and will run from July 23, with several heats throughout the year leading toward a grand finals to be held in December.

Like DLSS, DLAA uses a dash of AI brainpower to stitch together frames with more detail than conventional anti-aliasing techniques like TAA and MSAA – only with DLAA, there’s no upscaling involved. That means no performance gains, but for those with sufficiently powerful Nvidia RTX GPUs, potentially superior image quality at all resolutions. Even better than DLSS, mayhaps.

I wouldn't have gone out of my way to make a John Cena Metroid connection, but it's there! You might recall this pre-launch event to promote the Switch five years ago, that involved at least one celebrity: John Cena included. Well it turns out that other than being a general Nintendo fan, he was also a Metroid fanatic. According to games writer and former WWE producer Dan Ryckert, Cena was all about the series.
During the event in 2017, it's reported that Cena "repeatedly" told Nintendo reps that he wished the company would make another 2D Metroid. Ryckert, who had access to WWE talent during his tenure with them, notes that once Metroid Dread actually came out years later, Nintendo sent it to him. Apparently Cena's camp told Nintendo "John loves it." Former Nintendo host and Nintendo PR manager Krysta Yang corroborated the John Cena Metroid story on Twitter, noting that Cena talked about the series at the event.
As this John Cena Metroid tale points out, it's hard to believe it's been five years since the Switch came out, given that it's still going strong. But after all this time it's still around, and we got multiple 2D Metroid games in that timespan (don't forget that the 3DS hosted Samus Returns later in 2017!). I assume given the good sales figures for Metroid Dread (comparatively, stacked up against the rest of the series), we'll see another 2D Metroid eventually.
And there's Metroid Prime 4, which totally still exists right?!

On paper, Wreckfest is one of those games that should never really be possible on the Switch, at least not in a sufficiently playable state. When it came to PS4 and Xbox One in 2019, even though it was widely praised, many noted that it suffered from some technical issues and extremely long loading times. Surely if you’re bringing a game to the Switch when it was already pushing more powerful hardware to its limits, you’re setting yourself up for a broken disaster?
Not this time. Somehow, the wizards at developer Bugbear have not only managed to get Wreckfest running on the Switch, but it’s easily one of the better-looking racing games on the system and an absolute treat to play.

Below is an obituary written by Steven L. Kent, author and gaming journalist, sent to Game Informer for use, in full: 
Bernard “Bernie” Stolar, a former top executive at Atari, Sony Computer Entertainment America, and Sega of America, passed away at the age of 75.
“Bernie was a low-key guy. He kept his ego in check,” remembers Vince Desi, founder of Running with Scissors. “I’ve known Bernie for a long time, and I’ve never heard him raise his voice. He was a gentleman in an industry where there really aren’t many.” 
Stolar’s introduction to the video game business came with the 1981 release of an arcade game called Shark Attack. Created by Pacific Novelty and manufactured by Game P…]]></summary>

In the latest Metroid Prime interview from KIWI TALKZ, ex-Retro Studios developer Paul Tozour talks about his experience working with Nintendo and specifically Metroid Prime's producer, Kensuke Tanabe. When the subject about how the Metroid Prime games blend western and eastern design philosophies together, Tozour shares a rather amusing anecdote regarding the influence of Xbox's Halo series on Metroid Prime 3: Corruption.

"There are influences of Halo in Metroid Prime 3: Corruption because a couple of designers on the team were big Halo fans and that, as I understand it, caused some problems with Tanabe-san, because of course he did not care about Halo. But the first Dark Samus battle was our attempt to create a boss encounter that felt more like a typical western shooter game, that felt more like a Call of Duty or something like that and give more of that feeling."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The 2022 Nintendo Direct Mini is at 9AM ET on June 28
Well, it's happening! Sorta! It's not the full Nintendo Direct that was predicted by some on June 29 — rather, it's a Nintendo Direct Mini on June 28. That's at 9AM ET, actually, and the publisher says it'll be happening here when the time comes.
Again, it's important to note that this isn't a first-party Direct, and to set your expectations accordingly. Here is the full descriptive rundown of the Nintendo Direct Mini that we got directly from Nintendo:
"Watch on-demand via our YouTube channel starting at 6 a.m. PT / 9 a.m. ET on June 28 for roughly 25 minutes of info on upcoming third-party Nintendo Switch games."

So on paper, we're not getting updates on Zelda: Breath of the Wild 2 or Metroid Prime 4...yet. Or an update on when Advance Wars might come out on Switch for that matter.
25 minutes is a fairly meaty timeframe, in any case, so we should see at least one big third-party announcement. I assume a lot of you will be doing avid amounts of research as to what a Nintendo Direct Mini actually entails, and we did a lot of the legwork already! You can check this out to get an idea of what a Direct Mini could look like.
The company was smart to move this away from the Summer of Gaming/to-E3-or-not-to-E3 week and have it be its own thing. Even if it doesn't include first-party updates, all it takes is one megaton announcement (something exclusive akin to Shin Megami Tensei V) to make waves.

As many have predicted and expected, Nintendo is hosting a Direct tomorrow, but it's not the typical Direct many were hoping to see happen sometime this month to coincide with the rest of the big June gaming showcases. That's because it's a Direct Mini that's also a partner showcase. This means it will be a smaller-scale Direct (see: mini) focused on third-party titles. However, this doesn't necessarily mean we won't see anything from Nintendo's first-party studios because surprises can happen – just don't go in expecting it. 
A new #NintendoDirectMini: Partner Showcase is on the way! Watch on-demand via our YouTube channel beginning Tuesday, June 28 at 6am PT for roughly 25 minutes of info on upcoming third-party #NintendoSwitch games.

June 27, 2022
Not much else is known about the direct, and there aren't too many rumors swirling around this partner showcase in regards to specific titles or announcements. Fortunately, we don't have to wait long because we're less than 24 hours away from this Direct Mini. 
While waiting for tomorrow, read about how Shigeru Miyamoto initially cringed when he saw the art style of The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker is a beloved game in the long-running Zelda series, but when it was first revealed, the reception was mixed. Some were completely on board, ready for this new take on the franchise, while others weren’t too happy about the visual style of the game. The latter party apparently included Legend of Zelda creator Shigeru Miyamoto. 
According to a translation of an old issue of Nintendo Dream Magazine by DidYouKnowGaming, Wind Waker director Eiji Aonuma said Miyamoto “literally cringed” when he first saw the game’s visual style, as reported by Video Games Chronicle. 


“If I had gone and talked to him from the very beginning, I think he would’ve said ‘How is that Zelda?'." Aonuma said in the magazine. “Miyamoto had trouble letting go of the realistic Link art style until the very end.
“At some point, he had to give a presentation against his will. That’s when he said something to me like, ‘You know, it’s not too late to change course and make a realistic Zelda.'” 
Miyamoto is a legend, obviously, but it might’ve been a good thing that Aonuma trusted he and his team’s instinct and continued forward with Wind Waker’s art style – the game’s all the more memorable for it. 
For more about Miyamoto, read how he wants to make the world a better place and then check out this story about how the latest Zelda, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild 2 (or whatever its sequel ends up being titled) has been delayed out of 2022 and into spring of 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's good through today
There's another Pokemon Sword and Shield gift afoot, and this one is celebrating the North American International Championships and participant Eric Rios.
Specifically, it gifts players a level 50 "sassy" Gastrodon, with the ability storm drain, the leftovers held item, and earth power, ice beam, yawn, and protect moves. You'll be able to pick it up via the mystery gift menu with the code "ER1CSGASTR0D0N" throughout today, and note that as of this morning, it was still live. The code aired during the championship stream itself, as is customary with these types of championship-based codes.

As a reminder, here's how to redeem Pokemon Sword and Shield mystery gifts:
Boot up the game and head to the main menu
Select mystery gift (the purple present icon)
Select "get a mystery gift"
Go to "get with code/password"
Enter the code above
For now, the momentum of Sword and Shield gift bonuses continues, though that will slow down later this year once Scarlet and Violet hit, and eventually, end altogether. Such is the flow of time when it comes to new generations: not to mention the off-kilter distribution schedule of spinoffs and re-releases. There's generally a more interesting way that distributions could be done in Pokemon, and hopefully future generations will take advantage of things like more exciting unique distro opportunities.

If you're familiar with The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker (and if not, then you should be), then you'll know that Link is able to control the direction of the wind, among other things, with the game's magical baton known as the 'Wind Waker'.
Originally, however, the Wind Waker was intended to be much more complex in design. Indeed, it was initially based on the theremin, an electronic musical instrument that can be played without any physical contact. As explained by Did You Know Gaming, the team behind the game became familiar with the theremin after a documentary examining the life of inventor Leon Theremin premiered in Japan around the time of development.

In a new series of tweets first spotted by Video Games Chronicle, Kojima has revealed that at one point in the past (likely 2019, which is when the first season of The Boys aired), he was making something similar in concept to The Boys.

Although Tozour understandably doesn't divulge which Nintendo IP the game was tied to (though there has been ongoing speculation that the studio worked on a game starring The Legend of Zelda's Sheik), he did share his thoughts on why the project proved particularly frustrating for him and and the circumstances surrounding this.

John Cena is one of the most recognisable faces in the pro wrestling world. He's widely regarded as one of the best wrestlers of all time and has been the world champion for a record 16-times (joint with Ric Flair), but the star is also known as an actor and a rapper. And as the face of the Nintendo Switch in America prior to the console's release.
Back in 2017, the professional wrestler filmed a number of promotional ads for the Switch which included him playing the console in 'unexpected places' while also being present at events where fans could play 1-2-Switch at pop-up locations.

Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes has just launched and is, by all accounts, a strong entry to the Warriors series for Nintendo Switch. We gave it a 9/10 in our recent review, calling it a "thoroughly entertaining mash-up of Musou mayhem, strategy and relationship-building aspects".
The game has resonated with fans well over the course of just a few days, bagging the top spot in this week's UK top ten charts. As pointed out by Christopher Doing from GameIndustry.biz, sales for Three Hopes are above its predecessor Fire Emblem Warriors and roughly level with Hyrule Warriors.

And, as sure as day follows night, as sure as palpitations follow caffeine, as sure as negativity follows a live stream, it's the weekend — Welcome to Whatcha Been Playing? I hope that the week has treated you kindly and, more importantly, I hope that you have treated yourself kindly. We want you happy and healthy, and while we don't have direct control over either, never forget that we gotcha back. You are among friends here, as true as it ever was. Hope that you have a ton o' fun this weekend, whatever you're choosing to do with your spare time. Make it a good one, 'kay? Don't watch IT: Chapter Two. Terrible.
Round and Round
It's just been fight, fight, fight, fight, fightin' for me all week. I'm currently bouncing around between the golden oldies of the Capcom Fighting Collection, (I'd forgotten quite how much I love Darkstalkers 3), while also digging into the long-time-coming, plucky underdog that is Nexon's anime fighter DNF Duel. You'll be hearing about my opinions on both real soon. But hoo boy, DNF Duel, Capcom Fighting Collection, an incoming new season for Guilty Gear Strive, and, of course, Street Fighter 6 looking better by the week. We eating good, FGC, here's hoping the banquet continues.
Creatures of the Night
So, before we all get back to our own individual fights, be sure to gather in the comments and tell the good people whatcha been playing. It's currently looking like the first half of 2022 might prove to be the heavier six months in regards to exciting, top-tier releases, and as such, there are probably a lot of rad titles you have queued up. And that's before you even factor in the bottomless pit that is The Backlog. But why am I still yammering on, you know how this works — I wanna know what's keeping you entertained, as do your fellow community pals, so put us outta our misery.
Have a wonderful weekend, from all of us at Destructoid.

If you weren't immediately sold on the art style in The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, don't feel too bad. A new 'DidYouKnowGaming' translation (thanks, VGC) of a Nintendo Dream magazine from the mid-2000s reveals how Mario's creator Shigeru Miyamoto initially wasn't a fan of Toon Link or the rest of Wind Waker's cel-shaded and anime-like aesthetics.
According to Zelda series producer Eiji Aonuma - who was at the time the director of Wind Waker, Miyamoto struggled to move away from the idea of a realistic art style, right up until the end of the game's development cycle. And when he first saw Link in Wind Waker, he apparently "cringed", claiming it wouldn't sell.

It is certainly not seen as a form of theft by these legal experts. Based on these findings, the researchers call for a paradigm shift where entertainment providers focus more on convenience, accessibility and affordability.

A new generation of Pokémon is on the horizon and with it comes speculation and anticipation that runs as rampant as a horde of Tauros. During this time, a new generation’s Starter Pokémon take the centre stage, particularly their final forms. With Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, releasing on 18th November, fans are already anticipating what the three starters — Sprigatito, Fuecoco, and Quaxly — will look like once they reach the end of their evolutionary lines.
For Pokémon Sword and Shield, Game Freak tried to keep the evolutions of Grookey, Scorbunny, and Sobble a secret up until release, but they were leaked about two weeks before the game launched. While we wait for the inevitable leak to happen – of which questionable rumours are already swirling around the internet – we decided to take a stab at what Generation IX’s Starters will look like with the help of a professional artist.

It's time once again to watch some sick speedrunning exhibitions. Summer Games Done Quick 2022 gets underway today, as speedrunners gather in Minnesota to go fast for a good cause.
For anyone unfamiliar, Games Done Quick is a twice-a-year event where speedrunners—players who compete to clear objectives in games as fast as possible—put on exhibitions for charity. SGDQ supports Doctors Without Borders, while Awesome Games Done Quick raises funds for the Prevent Cancer Foundation.
This year's SGDQ is a notable one because it's the first time, since AGDQ 2020, that a Games Done Quick event has been held in-person. The event has outlined its COVID policies online, but this will be the first time we've had some genuine crowds since pre-pand…]]></summary>

The ‘90s and 2000s were a totally different era. I can’t tell you how many times I sat down playing the same demo discs over and over or replaying the same handful of games as a kid. Bandai Namco’s old mascot Klonoa — soon to return in the upcoming Klonoa Phantasy Reverie Series — is the first-ever video game character I ever did this with.
I had a mild obsession with one particular demo disc that contained the first level of Klonoa: Door to Phantomile – the chirpy, woodwind music, the adorable floppy-eared character, and the lovely visuals just captured my enthusiasm like nothing else. And eventually, I got my hands on Door to Phantomile and the PS2 sequel – Lunatea’s Veil – and played both of them to death. For many people, these two games (and the Wii remake of the first) are where the series ends, and these are the two titles that are included in the upcoming Switch game.

Perhaps renaming the game Final Fantasy III in the US and giving it a drastically different box art design was not the most wise decision...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not THAT Amaterasu
Something long forgotten has been pulled from Hamster Corp's big bag 'o' retro games this week, as the Arcade Archives range has been bolstered with the addition of Nichibutsu's classic shmup Soldier Girl Amazon, now available to download on Nintendo Switch.
Released to arcades in 1986, Soldier Girl Amazon, (also known as Holy Warrior Amaterasu and, simply, Amazon), is a top-down shooter that is incredibly reminiscent of titles such as SNK's Ikari Warriors and Capcom's Commando and Gun.Smoke. Albeit with an odd fantasy/sci-fi/real-world angle. In fact, it makes for a pretty strange pairing as our hero, the beautiful sun goddess Amaterasu, wields her magic sword and shield against an army of monsters, aliens, and... erm... army dudes?
Check out her holiness in action below, courtesy of this trailer from Hamster Corporation itself.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgmZLLG8vcs
Our hero battles her way through eight vertically scrolling stages, taking down a vast array of colorful enemies as well as some surprisingly creepy boss guardians. Amaterasu can gather multiple power-ups to increase her weapon's effectiveness, and can even mount a Space Motorcycle, which hilarious goes at almost the exact same speed as when she is merely walking. Worth checking out for fans of the top-shooter genre. It should also be noted that Soldier Girl Amazon has already been released on PS4 previously.
Soldier Girl Amazon is available now on Nintendo Switch, priced at around $8.

If there is one surefire way to get my attention during a video game reveal stream, it’s to show me something that looks far different from the norm. Gimmie something unusual, something that every other developer isn’t out there trying to make. I love the big franchises and AAA games as much as the next person. But, when I see something like Lake or Season: A letter to the future or that dinosaur high school game that’ll probably never release, I really start to focus and obsess about what that game might turn out to be. And I have been obsessing about As Dusk Falls for quite some time.

A fascinating video has appeared online that appears to show alpha footage of a sequel to the 2006 action-adventure adaptation Scarface: The World is Yours. The sequel, Scarface: Empire, was in development at studio Radical Entertainment but was canceled once the Canadian outfit was merged with Activision in 2008.
The new footage, acquired by YouTube channel Mafia Game Videos and spotted by the eagle eyes of VGC, shows the apparently unkillable Tony Montana running amok in the streets of Las Vegas, taking on an army of hoodlums while accompanied by a gang of masked associates. The carnage is scored by two licensed music tracks: Elvis Presley's "Viva Las Vegas" and Motley Crue's "Dr. Feelgood," suggesting that Scarface: Empire would have had a licensed soundtrack befitting i…]]></summary>

As some of the regular Destructoid clan may know, Final Fight is my favorite game of all time. I'm not gonna roll out why all over again, who cares, yo? Just know that I've plunged hours upon hours (upon hours) into Capcom's legendary brawler, and across myriad platforms — thus, I was left reeling by some recently rediscovered tech, which is hidden away deep inside the grindhouse gutter fighter.

Welcome back! Tonight we’ll continue through the absolute fever dream that Fran Bow is turning out to be. It started off as a severely creepy point-and-click adventure puzzler, and slowly turned into a bizarre Alice in Wonderland-flavored experience.

I wonder if they'll pivot back to unsettling or if we’re headed down this rabbit hole for good? I found the creepier section more coherent than the one we left off in, so hopefully I can follow along a bit better now.
We got about halfway last time, so pop by tonight to chill with us and see where the story ends!

While Resident Evil and Street Fighter are firmly in the spotlight right now, I've also been curious about Exoprimal, Capcom's five-on-five team action game in which players go to town on hordes of no-good dinosaurs. The idea is to be better (read: faster) at completing objectives than the opposing squad, in order to appease a conniving AI named Leviathan.
It's not going to be to everyone's tastes — and I sympathize with any ride-or-die fan who is exclusively holding out for a Dino Crisis revival (maybe one day...) — but as someone who got into Lost Planet back in the day, I'm intrigued. Exoprimal seems like the kind of project we haven't really gotten out of Capcom in recent years, for better or worse.

Though AI: The Somnium Files - nirvanA Initiative is a mouthful of a name, visual novel fans are likely familiar with the writer behind it. Kotaro Uchikoshi is back for this follow-up to 2019's AI: The Somnium Files with a new case, new investigators, and a story so good that it, at times, eclipses its predecessor.
Getting a mystery story right is tough. A good detective thriller has to carefully thread a needle, leading the player along without tugging too hard or leaving too much slack. Nirvana Initiative does so quite well, composing the kind of bending, twisting story you'd expect from the writer behind Ever17 and the Zero Escape series.
The story gets both comedy and drama just right, while also presenting some very well-crafted puzzles and pseudo-escape rooms. A…]]></summary>

Even with Haunted Chocolatier on the horizon, the creator of Stardew Valley can't seem to step away from the farm-sim life for good, and we love him for it. Update 1.5 was a banger. With a whole new island to explore and expand, plus plenty of small but impactful quality-of-life enhancements, it could've gone down as the game's "final update" — it felt like it. But what are the odds of Stardew Valley 1.6? ConcernedApe says it's coming.
Responding to a fan on Twitter, the developer said that Stardew Valley will get a 1.6 update — though we should keep our expectations in check. It'll be focused on making modders' lives "easier," and while there will be "some new content," it won't be "huge."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Chris Pratt as Mario is still leaving me skeptical
When we all saw that Chris Pratt had been cast as the plumber in red in the upcoming animated Mario movie, a few eyebrows were raised, to say the least. He's a fine actor, but I don't know that I trust him to do one of the most iconic video game characters justice, especially after the legacy that Charles Martinet has created.
One of the most glaring questions to come up surrounding Pratt's involvement in the movie over the past few weeks is whether or not he'll have an Italian accent, which is arguably one of Mario's most recognizable features.
In an exclusive interview with Variety, Pratt gave a little bit of insight into what fans can expect from his work on the movie.

"I worked really closely with the directors and trying out a few things and landed on something that I’m really proud of and can’t wait for people to see and hear," Pratt said. "I’m providing a voice for an animated character, and it is updated and unlike anything you’ve heard in the Mario world before."
This could mean a lot of things, but I hope it means that they at least did something. The thought of Chris Pratt's unaltered voice coming out of Mario sends chills down my spine.
When Variety brought up fans' apprehension in a separate interview about Pratt's casting as a character of Italian heritage, Illumination Entertainment's founder and CEO Chris Meledandri said that because he is Italian American himself, he feels that he can "make that decision without worrying about offending Italians or Italian Americans. … I think we’re gonna be just fine. Especially because (Pratt has) given such a strong performance."
Meledandri also said that "when people hear Chris Pratt’s performance, the criticism will evaporate." I guess we'll have to wait and see about that one.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With its approachable gameplay and chess-like complexity, Into the Breach has been an incredible strategy option for PC and Switch owners. With its upcoming Advanced Edition expansion, new content is getting pumped into the mech tactics games where it can already be played. Even better still, mobile versions are landing the same day with the new DLC bolted right in from the start.


Subset Games, which also developed the space-faring rogue-lite FTL, is releasing the Advanced edition on July 19. It comes new units, weapons, pilots, abilities, and more. For expert players, there will be a more challenging difficulty mode to contend with, along with new bosses and enemies to learn to defeat efficiently and effectively. Here are some bullet points of what to expect in Into the Breach's Advanced Edition Update:
Five new mech squads
Nearly 40 new weapons
Four new pilots and new pilot abilities
New enemies, bosses, and missions
More challenging difficulty mode
Seven new languages
New music from Ben Prunty
Into the Breach will be making its mobile device debut on July 19 as well, but these editions are only available for Netflix subscribers. Subset Games promises there are no ads or in-app purchases involved with the mobile app. All you need to access it is to be a Netflix subscriber, and the game is free to access on your iOS and Android device. These versions include a revised touch interface designed to function better on a smaller screen like a cell phone.
For those who like to collect, Into the Breach is going to have a physical edition on Switch courtesy of Fangamer. Preorders are live now, and the boxed copy will be released later this year. This tactile copy of Into the Breach will include the Advanced Edition content listed above but will also come with other physical goodies like a poster, inside cover box art, an instruction manual, and sticker sheets.]]></summary>

I fell hopelessly in love with Metal Max Xeno Reborn. It was my first time with the series, which has been running in Japan since 1991. It was quite the roller coaster for me.

Then I found love again in Metal Max for the Famicom. Then I reminded myself that Metal Max: Wild West was canceled, and now I’m sad again.
Metal Max has largely stayed in Japan, outside of Xeno and its Reborn cousin. We got Metal Saga on PS2, but that went by without much notice. Maybe we’ll get a re-release on PS5 now that Sony is doing that again. There were many titles that flitted by without our anglophone notice, and I plan on delvi…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A popular browser-based Game Boy Advance emulator with nearly 100 working games was removed from GitHub this week. The takedown request was sent by the ESA, which acts on behalf of Nintendo and other game companies. The problem hasn't been sorted out completely, however, as nostalgic games can easily find alternatives, even on GitHub.

In Jurassic World Evolution 2's new expansion, Dominion Biosyn, you play through this corporation's first days and learn how its hunger to bring back never-before-seen dinosaurs takes a turn for the worse.
My time in Biosyn's sprawling dinosaur sanctuary was short yet rewarding. The new campaign flows harmlessly from mission to mission, allowing for success with little pushback. Some dinosaurs get sick or may misbehave, but this is essentially a stress-free playthrough that lets you interact with a handful of fantastic new dinosaurs within just an hour or two.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jupiter looms large, serving as an imposing backdrop as cargo ship pilot Jacob Lee crashes on the Gas Giant’s second-biggest moon. Our solar system’s largest planet may play host to a seemingly eternal storm, but something far fiercer is brewing on Callisto. It’s here that the creator of the Dead Space series, Glen Schofield, stages perhaps his most horrifying project yet.
Set 300 years in the future, The Callisto Protocol unmistakably carries Schofield’s creative DNA, but through innovative technology, an uncompromised vision, and lessons learned from decades of development experience, Striking Distance Studios feels it has something more than a spiritual successor on its hands. The Callisto Protocol challenges players to face their fears as they descend into the depths of a lunar prison overrun by monstrous, infected humans and uncover what happened to one of our great hopes for life beyond Earth. We witnessed never-before-seen gameplay and spent hours picking the brains of Striking Distance Studios’ veteran developers to learn how this team is creating one of the scariest, most intense games of 2022.
In 2019, Schofield took a trip out to the desert to get away from the hustle and bustle of the game industry. Just months prior, he had left Activision, a publisher with whom he had worked for nearly a decade. While there, he helped lead a studio he cofounded, Sledgehammer Games, as it worked on three mainline Call of Duty titles: Modern Warfare 3, Advanced Warfare, and WWII. Schofield eventually transitioned to an executive role within Activision before leaving the company less than a year later. He decided to take some time off and plot his next move.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[coverage here.

In a recent Reddit AMA, the Overwatch 2 team from Blizzard Entertainment took questions from the community regarding the state of the franchise and the upcoming pseudo-sequel to its popular hero shooter. In one answer, the folks from Blizz confirm an interesting detail about OW2 when it hits Early Access in the first week of October: it’ll replace the original Overwatch entirely.
When OW2 launches on Oct 4th it will be a replacement for the current Live Service.

Rather than being a separate app on your console of choice or the Blizzard launcher, Overwatch 2 won’t be built up bit by bit on its own but will take the place of the original game and build off of that instead.
While Overwatch 1 and 2 have always been planned to be tied together into a single client and overall roadmap, this is the first time Blizzard has announced publically that Overwatch 1 will cease to exist entirely when the sequel launches. Get your 6v6 games in now because they won’t be playable as of the OW2 Early Access launch.
Also of note from this quote is the timeframe of PvE content coming to OW2. Its initial Early Access content this year will provide a revamp to the PvP experience with new heroes, maps, modes, etc., but the long-touted narrative content for the sequel will be coming sometime in 2023 instead of with the rest of the package.
Overwatch 2 will be free-to-play starting on October 4 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.]]></summary>

Most of the things that get recreated aren't the things I miss about 90s games, and if they were... Doom still exists, you know? So does Blood, and Strife, and Quake was never that good anyway.


Extraneum is good, though. I think it's precisely because it's not doing a big song and dance about its influences, although those are very clear. It's not big or brash, nor overly stripped down or obnoxious about difficulty. Clean blasty strafey fun, with a tiniest hint of horror. In an odd way, it's all the more faithful for that.

Those who venture into the Molten Mirrors DLC will face off against the Fyodor, the Soul Warden who digs holes and hordes souls, probably. In the trailer, there's plenty of footage of the bullet-hell elements added to Molten Mirrors that will surely put players' abilities at dipping and dodging to the test. 
However, taking on the challenges of the Soul Worden and the Molten Mirrors content isn't free. You can join in on the fresh mayhem if you own the Wonderlands with the $29.99 Season Pass or purchase the DLC on its own for $9.99.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the giant jumbled word cloud of all my qualities and traits, I'm willing to bet that "pluviophile" would be one of the biggest words. I adore rain. Whenever it starts, I tend to drop whatever I'm doing - work, dishes, significant other - and I'll be out frolicking in the downpour before they've hit the floor.
Because I love rain so much, I hold games to an almost unfair standard when it comes to the simulation of precipitation. How in the world can a videogame come close to emulating that wonderful, transcendental feeling of being outside in the middle of a thunderstorm? The answer is, it can't. Games have to rely on other things, like textures, sounds, and clever little animations to really sell the idea of being out amongst the H₂s and the Os.
The time has come, fellow pluviophiles. It's time to grade the very best rain that PC gaming has to offer. Below you'll find our eight worthy contenders. Each has been chosen for their spectacular rendition of one of nature's greatest phenomena. Each one shall be marked according to my patented and cutting-edge WIPERS grading system for digital rain. So drop what you're doing. It's time to frolick. No umbrella required.

Translations of the interview are courtesy of Google translate, so please forgive if they are a little rough.
Regarding the next From Software project, 4Gamer inquired about three games that were in the pipeline when Sekiro was in development. At the time, two of the titles were unknown to the public, with one ending up being this year's smash hit Elden Ring. As for the other, we seemingly don't have to wait too long to see what it is.

What I wasn't expecting was to feel a bit emotional about the game's reveal, though. I mean, I felt this weird swell in my chest of excitement or something. Maybe it was the crushing jet lag, or maybe it was a heady mixture of nostalgia. Let's investigate.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Illumination’s upcoming animated Mario movie was recently delayed to next spring. Perhaps the biggest downside to that news is the fact that we have to go even longer before hearing what Chris Pratt’s Mario voice sounds like. Today, Variety caught up with Pratt to ask about the film, with the actor describing his take on Mario as “unlike anything you’ve heard in the Mario world before.”
For those unaware, Pratt portrays Mario in the film and much the biggest buzz around the film has centered on his voice. Some have expressed concern about a non-Italian playing an Italian character and the voice potentially being offensive while the film’s co-producer described Pratt’s performance as “phenomenal.” 
Speaking to Variety, Pratt discusses how he experimented with the voice and worked closely with directors to find a unique take on Mario that he felt proud of, saying in part “It’s an animated voiceover narrative. It’s not a live-action movie. I’m not gonna be wearing a plumber suit running all over. I’m providing a voice for an animated character, and it is updated and unlike anything you’ve heard in the Mario world before.”
Regardless of what Pratt sounds like, Nintendo is reportedly happy with the film, which was said to be mostly finished last November, so Illumination must be doing something right. The Mario movie is slated to premiere in U.S. theaters on April 7. In addition to Chris Pratt’s Mario, the cast includes Charlie Day (Luigi), Anya Taylor-Joy (Peach), Jack Black (Bowser), Keegan-Michael Key (Toad), and Seth Rogen (Donkey Kong).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Despite being heavily criticized for his role in Activision Blizzard’s ongoing employee sexual abuse scandal, CEO Bobby Kotick will remain on the company’s board of directors for another year.
The publisher held its annual meeting of stockholders, who voted on five proposals, such as its list of ten directors, including Kotick, to serve one-year terms. The document detailing the results shows that an overwhelming 533,703,580 investors voted in Kotick’s favor against 62,597,199 who voted against him. 2,162,178 shareholders abstained from voting.
The result means that Kotick retains his spot until Activision’s 2023 stockholder meeting next June. The development comes after Kotick spent the last year under fire for reportedly hiding details of the company’s abuse problems from shareholders, which caused some employees and investors to call for his resignation. Kotick has responded by reducing his salary until “transformational gender goals” were met. Activision has since hired new chief diversity, equity, and inclusion officer. 
Although Kotick remains on Activision’s board, his future as CEO once Microsoft’s acquisition of the company is complete remains unknown. The deal isn’t expected to go through until sometime next summer, possibly around the time of the next stockholder meeting.]]></summary>

The second is 'What would it be like if you had the power of rats?'. The third is, 'What if rats had any power to have?'. As a new extended trailer shows, the answer is: you can sense blood, and use that power to avoid the guards who want to do a big murder on you and your sister.

The trailer is worth watching for its own sake, but also comes with news: Requiem will launch on October 18th, forwarding another fantasy called 'What if a game actually came out in 2022 and wasn't delayed until next year?'.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Crystal Dynamics announced in April that Marvel's Avengers' next hero would be Jane Foster as the Mighty Thor. A new War Table blog post names the date fans will see the Goddess of Thunder in action.
Mark Monday, June 27 on your calendar as the date to watch a War Table Deep Dive detailing Jane's powers and abilities. Jane will become available as part of the 2.5 update, which arrives just a day later on June 28. That should whet fans' appetite for the character's Norse-powered return in the upcoming Thor: Love & Thunder, which hits theaters on July 8. 
It'll be interesting to see how Crystal Dynamics differentiates Jane's moveset from Thor's. In the comics, Jane possessed all of the abilities of Thor during her time as the Goddess of Thunder. The only notable difference was her ability to manipulate Mjolnir with greater control and creativity (especially when throwing it) than her predecessors, so that's something the studio can certainly hone in and expand upon.

The release confirmation comes alongside an extended gameplay showing that follows Amicia and Hugo as they attempt to escape an enemy-laden quarry.
You can watch the new demo below to get an in-game look at a slice of the game’s story, as the siblings are pursued by soldiers. This leads to a good showing of the game's stealth as the pair sneak around the quarry. Amicia also gets her hands dirty taking out enemies in a showcase of the game's action. 


Additionally, a video showcasing the game’s previously announced $189.99 Collector’s Editon provides up-close looks at the Amicia and Hugo resin statue. 


A Plague Tale: Requiem will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. It will also be playable on Switch via cloud streaming.]]></summary>

Beyond that, Nightdive's remastering has made Westwood's 1997 adventure game look notably uglier and you'd be better off with GOG's ScummVM version. The Enhanced Edition is out today and I've been flicking back and forth between the two versions, tutting. The Enhanced Edition still looks like a 25-year-old game, only now it looks 25 years old, blurry, and unlike itself.

To understand the design process behind the Biophage and the game’s copious amounts of gore, we spoke with Striking Distance’s Character Director Glauco Longhi to learn how the studio created nightmares it hopes will terrify players. 
Longhi tells us the Biophage was born out of the studio’s philosophical desire to create enemies grounded in reality while also applying their own creativity. He even cites realism as one of his personal pillars of what makes the most effective horror monster.
“It has to feel grounded, it has to feel real,” Longhi explains.  “It doesn't have to be real, but it has to feel real, right? That can mean many different things. But in my opinion, it has to be interesti…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I still don't know whether to describe The Heroic Legend Of Eagarlnia as "complicated" or "simple". Before starting a game, it gives an impression of being a complex grand strategy that's something like a fantasy Total War with a D&D alignment system and a distinctly East Asian focus on characters and dialogue.
It's far simpler than that. There was a period of disappointment, even, when it seemed like there wasn't much to it at all. That's partly because it's easy to play it too passively, or get stuck in attritional stand offs, and partly because of the need for a bit too much repetition. But over time its subtler details become more apparent, and your choices start to feel more multifaceted.
And yet, it remains at heart the same throughout. On your first ten turns you're doing the same actions as in your 200th, and its battles in particular are largely hands off. So maybe it's complicated, but simple to actually play? Hmm.

We know what you're thinking, and yes, we are aware that Nintendo just put on a Xenoblade 3 digital showcase, but that won't stop us from hoping for more. Just like with Sony and Microsoft, we're brushing off our crystal balls and predicting what Nintendo will have at its big summer Direct...whenever that may be.
Will The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild's sequel make an appearance with a more concrete gameplay section and a name reveal? Will Nintendo continue to roll out its iconic characters on Switch with a new Donkey Kong game? Can we expect to see Samus in the form of the rumored Metroid Prime Trilogy port or the much-anticipated Metroid Prime 4? Only time will tell, but we hope today's podcast will be a fun distraction while we wait for the next big Nintendo Direct!

Wccftech spotted that some erstwhile miners across China and South Asia, previously encouraged by low energy costs, are even hosting livestreamed auctions to get rid of their GPU ‘stock’ en masse. 


First off: ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. Second, while it’s entertaining to imagine desperate crypto barons hosting a kind of QVC channel for dusty PC components, I wouldn’t necessarily take this as a long-overdue opportunity to upgrade your graphics card on the cheap.

Who'd have thought? Not me. And in fact there is weather in all sorts of places you wouldn't expect to look.
Don't worry, though, because we find time to talk about how our weeks have been, as well as a bit where I tell Nate there's going to be a survival crafting game set in Moria and he gets excited.

We knew from a Nintendo Direct that aired earlier this year the game was coming to the portable console before today's announcement. However, the last mention of the project came with a summer release window, which has now been pushed back. But vague time frames are a thing of the past, No Man's Sky is officially coming to the Switch October 7. 
Fans all over the world can pick up either a physical or digital copy of the game come October. In addition to the Nintendo console launch, PlayStation 5 owners will be able to buy a physical remastered edition on the same date. The remaster will come with all the previously released content included, which when tallied up means new-gen PlayStation owners will have access to 20 different updates in total.


Looking over the titles's long history and its new leap onto the Switch, Hello Games founder Sean Murray observed the following.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was in LA for Summer Geoff Fest and I played a whole bunch of games. No, not lots of blockbusters – mainly because there weren't too many of those about - but lots of indies, instead. In fact, out of all the games I saw or played or glanced at while I dashed between appointments, it was the indies that really stood out.

This time, Randall made several of the RPS team spit out their tea when he revealed that the game’s horse model is really a stretched out human skeleton.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Atari is among the oldest and most well-known names in the gaming industry, and it’s celebrating its 50th year on June 27. It first established its headquarters in Sunnyvale, California, neighbor to a host of now-famous tech startups. The new logo, a callback to the retro design of the old location, features the company’s classic branding alongside a semi-transparent “50.” Atari is calling the limited-time celebration logo “Borregas” after the street where you could find the headquarters. According to the company, this design will join with the previously revealed “Sunnyvale” anniversary logo in gracing the many upcoming corporate announcements, game reveals, partnerships, and merchandising collaborations.
 “Design innovation was a fundamental driver and differentiator for Atari during the golden age of video games,” said Wade Rosen, CEO of Atari. “Every artist, designer, and engineer challenged themselves to reach creative excellence; it is a hallmark of Atari that persists to this day.”
In the midst of the logo’s reveal, it also looks like an Atari classic is getting a revival. According to Gamerbraves, a follow-up to Yar’s Revenge is in the works. The information comes straight from Howard Scott Warshaw, who worked at Atari in the ‘80s and created the title for the Atari 2600. The interview contained few concrete details on the project, just that it seems the sequel has been greenlit. Hopefully, we will hear more about the game as development continues.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sega's Creative Assembly is working on a brand-new game revealed today: Hyenas. The title is described as a multiplayer, multi-team heist experience set in space with a punky comic book aesthetic. What this means practically is players can jump into five teams of three to battle each other over a prize and "engage, evade, exploit, and steal their way to victory." The game's debut trailer shows off some fast-pasted action, but to see everything for yourself, you can check out the trailer below.


The story envisions a world in which the billionaires have finally made it to mars, destroying Earth in the process. However, the rich get nostalgic for their former planet's culture. So, they send out ships to collect plunder from the remnants of Earth's poor survivors. Not content to take this sitting down, the Hyenas are fighting back.
The game is still in early development, so the creators have not revealed the release date, but we do know the game is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. Though it's still a ways off, you can sign up for Hyenas' alpha today, and you can learn much more about the title in IGN's Summer of Gaming interview-filled stream.]]></summary>

Heading up Striking Distance Studios, the industry icon sits down with us today to go over 83 Rapid-Fire questions focusing on The Callisto Protocol, the horror genre, and so much more!


It's Alex Stadnik's turn to host, and he has plenty of questions. One of the main focuses is getting to know The Callisto Protocol and what players can expect. We find out basic information such as what kind of weapons we'll be using, why the game takes place on the dead moon of Jupiter, and the new gruesome Biophage enemies. We also dive into inspirations, definitively answer a circulating fan theory, and much more.
But this isn't Rapid-Fire without some fun, right? We also tell Glen our best Candyman joke, see if things like The Strangers or your mom using your full name are scarier than his upcoming game, and whether or not he can think of five words that rhyme with gore. But what other secrets does Glen have up his sleeve? You'll have to watch the video to find out! 
The Callisto Protocol is releasing on December 2, 2022, for PlayStation and Xbox consoles and PC. Head to our exclusive cover hub below, where you'll find our preview impressions, the GI cover reveal, and more looks at the game in the upcoming days. For more Rapid-Fire fun, check out our curated playlist on YouTube, featuring industry legends such as Tim Schafer, Joseph Staten, and Jake Solomon. Thanks, as always, for watching.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Believe it or not, The Callisto Protocol is a scary game. But it’s not enough to simply have horrifying monsters and an oppressive atmosphere; developer Striking Distance believes it’s how you arrange these elements. And it does so through a process the team dubs "horror engineering." 
Horror engineering defines the meticulous manner in which the team constructs its scares so they have the maximum effect on players. That ranges from designing a room with strategically placed entry points for the biophage, The Callisto Protocol’s monsters, to pop out, to obsessing over details as small as whether a light bulb should flicker two times or three. Imagine Disney’s Imagineering process applied to something much more gruesome. 
Horror engineering stems from the team’s desire to make The Callisto …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I got a hands off look at Oxenfree II: Lost Signals, my analysis was that it looked a lot like Oxenfree and therefore if you liked Oxenfree you would like this. I have now played through a small bit of the game, a slightly extended version of the area I saw in the hands off preview, and my analysis is... largely the same.
I know that's very boring, but it's also positive, isn't it? Oxenfree was good, and Oxenfree II looks to be doing those same things that made Oxenfree good. A 2D, side-on supernatural thriller with radios. Good thing remains good! In a world where sequels to beloved media seem to only get progressively worse, I'll happily take it (especially since this one is a Netflix-published project now). And although it's directly related to the first game, the characters and happenings in Oxenfree II are distinct enough that it's going to be accessible if you're new to the series. And even if you did play the first game, it's possible that Oxenfree II will be more thrilling and unsettling to you now, five years later.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Now that all the unusually stressful benchmarking is out the way, let’s talk how mineral-grubbing “quest shooter” The Cycle: Frontier performs on PC. Short version: pretty well! It can make do with older and lower-end hardware at 1080p, and scales nicely all the way up to 4K and ultrawide resolutions, taking full advantage of the best graphics cards or the best gaming monitors with high refresh rates. If your rig is only just scraping past the system requirements, there are also some chunky performance improvements available via the right graphics settings tweaks.

These range from teleporting back to your spawn point by changing loadout or class while touching the other team’s No Entry gate, to Spies disguising themselves and creating an invisible shield at their feet to block incoming fire.

The Basilisk Ultimate normally oscillates between $140 and a sale price of $90, but today it's gone lower - it's $80 at Amazon. That's a pretty solid price for what you're getting!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Callisto Protocol comes from the minds that spawned the Dead Space franchise, and it has more than a little in common with Isaac Clarke’s horrifying adventures. That isn’t to say it doesn’t have plenty of original ideas, but there are several mechanical, narrative, and visual nods that fans of EA’s premier horror franchise will recognize. Here are the biggest overlaps between the two. 
It Stars An Everyman
Jacob Lee, like Isaac Clarke, isn’t a soldier or trained fighter. He’s a cargo ship pilot who crash-lands on Callisto, which leads to his arrest and imprisonment. We don’t know why his arrival put him on the wrong side of the law, only that he “didn’t get a warm reception on Callisto,” according to Striking Distance. Although he can use a gun well enough, don’t expect Jacob to mow th…]]></summary>

It's not thrilling stuff - but it is further confirmation that Valve continue to work on designs for VR hardware.

        <updated>2022-06-21T18:47:03.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tiny Tina's Wonderlands, the Borderlands-meets-DND spin-off from earlier this year, is finally coming to Steam, publisher 2K Games and developer Gearbox Software announced today. You'll be able to play it on June 23.
Two different editions will be available – the Standard and, as Gearbox calls it, "Chaotic Great Edition." The latter includes the game's season pass and the Dragon Lord Pack Bonus Content, which, among other things, adds cosmetic content. The fancy edition also comes with (sigh) the Butt Stallion cosmetic pack and the four Mirrors of Mystery DLCs. The editions are available for $59.99 and $79.99 USD, respectively. 
Across all platforms, the Molten Mirrors (the third of the Mirrors of Mystery DLC) is also being released on June 23. As detailed by Gearbox: 
The last Mirrors of Mystery DLC is expected to be released later this year for owners of the Season Pass or Chaotic Great Edition. It will add a new playable class. "This shamanic elementalist channels spirits and summons storms to wear down foes with poison and elemental damage," Gearbox said in a press release.
According to our reviewer, Tiny Tina's Wonderland is really good. As we said, it's "upbeat and fun from start to finish, offering a rewarding adventure filled with goofy characters, imaginative bosses, and a great sense of ownership over your character through it all."]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The new and improved PlayStation Plus is live and surprisingly great. 
Of course, it has all the titles you might expect: God of War, Horizon Zero Dawn, and a bunch of other triple-A games. Whatever. But there's more to it than PlayStation's ever-growing list of really expensive games.
I had little-to-no interest in the new PlayStation Plus when it was announced. But when Sony gave me three free months – the perks of being in the press, I guess, but also something I should disclose given the glowing nature of this piece – I took the time to scroll through the games list. 
To my delight, it's full of weirdo games you probably haven't heard of and definitely have not played. Immediately, I downloaded nearly a dozen games based solely on the criteria of "Does this look weird and/or interesting?" It's been a blast. 
I finally played through the Gravity Rush series, and while I think Gravity Rush 2 is disappointing, the original is fantastic. I highly recommend checking it out. It takes about seven hours to mainline and consistently keeps mission design interesting. It's also a ton of fun throwing yourself around its dizzying open world. 
I also played Mitsurugi Kamui hikae. It's an objectively bad game but I can't help but love it. You play as a girl with a big sword, going after your friend who is also a girl with a big sword – but she's evil. You load into bland combat arenas that look ripped straight out of a PlayStation 2 game and fight enemies that all look the same. Again, it's bad. But charmingly, in a way I appreciate. I played for an hour and loved every second.
Next up are Disaster Report 4, Tokyo Jungle, and the Siren series. I can't wait. But I want to know, what hidden gems have you found on PlayStation Plus? Keep it weird, unique, and interesting. If you're finally checking out Red Dead Redemption II, keep it to yourself. We all know that's a great game. Drop down to the comments and let me know what weirdo games I should play next!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Callisto Protocol captured the attention of horror fans worldwide with its terrifying world and oppressive sense of horror, but how does it feel to play it? In this exclusive Game Informer interview, Ben Walker, design director at Striking Distance Studios, breaks down how combat, dodging, and the bounty of gameplay systems work.


Join Alex Stadnik and Marcus Stewart as they grill Ben on all things Callisto gameplay. The trio kicks off the conversation by dissecting the basics of combat. In Callisto, players balance melee and ranged encounters to keep protagonist Jacob alive as he fights through Saturn's dead moon. At your side is your trusty shiv, a shock baton, and a wide swath of weapons to fend off the Biophage and figure out what's happening on the moon.
While that may seem like a pretty standard setup, the key is how players balance their approach to enemy encounters. Callisto is not a game that will overpower players. Jacob has limited ammo and health and can't go in guns blazing if he hopes to survive. Those who delve into the fray will also have to utilize the new dodging system Striking Distance emphasizes as a massive part of combat. Instead of a simple button press, you'll have to use the left stick to dodge either left or right at the precise moment. Blocking works too, but it will always cost you a bit of health. Callisto has a lot going on moment to moment, but Striking Distance hopes this dance leads to a thrilling moment-to-moment experience.
If that's not enough, we also discuss how the team utilizes the PlayStation 5 controller to up the immersion, upgrade trees, and much more.

It conjures a mental image of a kid’s TV show where some, possibly sentai-style, superheroes learn about the importance of spelling and grammar. Maybe a little punctuation, as a treat. SpellForce the video game series isn’t that; it’s a trio of RPG-RTS hybrids which, by the time you read this, will have had a new entry announced in the form of SpellForce: Conquest Of Eo. It’s a fresh, turn-based take on the series which casts the player as a wizard attempting to further their mastery of magic.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since The Cycle: Frontier is having its second (???) launch tomorrow, June 22nd, I thought I’d knock together a performance and settings guide to mark the occasion. This would involve, as they always do, a bunch of benchmark tests: repeatable runs through a specific area or sequence that would give an accurate indication of how different settings and hardware affect performance. In most games these are either quick and easy or time-consuming and easy, but not The Cycle: Frontier. Oh no.


See, without a dedicated benchmarking tool, running these kinds of tests requires a certain controllable environment, where variables are known and parameters can be reset in a click. This is not the case for The Cycle: Frontier, whose environment is usually trying to fucking kill you, particularly though the unavoidable presence of other players. I’ve never sat down to record some average FPS values only to spend half my time cowering behind a tree, fearful of being shot, robbed and – worst of all – forced to start work over again.

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/06/21/tony-hawk-says-activision-killed-plans-for-more-thps-games"/>
        <updated>2022-06-21T15:42:41.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Remakes of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 and 4 were planned at some point until publisher Activision pulled the plug. This news comes from Tony Hawk himself, who discussed the series with streamer andyTHPS. 
According to Hawk, the "plan" was to develop remakes for THPS 3 and 4 following the release of the Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 and 2 remake. That plan, however, got complicated after Activision merged THPS1 and 2 developer Vicarious Visions into Blizzard. 
"The truth of it is that they were trying to find someone to do [Tony Hawk's Pro Skater] 3 and 4, but they just didn't really trust anyone the way they did Vicarious, so they took other pitches from other studios," Hawk says in the clip. "Like, 'What would you do with a THPS title?' And they didn't like anything they heard, and then that was it."
You can watch the full clip below: 
Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 remasters were in the works but they were scrapped after Vicarious Visions was merged into Blizzard. 😔
https://t.co/84rlYDgvUQ pic.twitter.com/oWR70xTOYv
June 20, 2022
At the very least, it doesn't sound like THPS3 and 4 was actively in development. As Hawk says in the clip, it was planned, but he never indicates it was in production. More curious is Activision's interest in taking the series in new directions. Historically, that's been a bad idea.  
The news is particularly painful because, after a drought of skateboarding games, the excellent Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 and 2 seemed to indicate the king of action sports was back. As we said in our review,  "the Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater franchise may once again have a bright future thanks to this terrific blast from the past." Alas, history proves otherwise. 
But actually, skateboarding games have had a renaissance in recent years. Of course, there's Vicarious Visions' Tony Hawk's Pro Skater reboot. There's also OlliOlli World, Skate City, Session, and Skater XL.]]></summary>

As if that wasn’t bad enough, it turns out that Heaven is a corrupt bureaucracy that’s absolutely stuffed with shadowy demons and talking cats. Those demons become your problem when god decides to give you a chance to earn your place in Heaven by committing murder - stylish, speedrunning, parkouring demon murder. It’s perdition with extra steps, then, but is it any fun? Dear reader, Neon White kicks ass.
The game opens with an extremely anime narrative sequence and we’re introduced to the lovable (and less so) doofuses we’ll be shooting up paradise with. This is where most folks will stop and squee at the fact that player character Neon White is voiced by the incomparable Steve Blum, perhaps known best for his role as sonorous space cowboy Spike Spiegel in Cowboy Bebop. White is joined by his fellow demon-slaying Neons including Yellow (best boy), Violet (sucks), Red (mysterious), and Green (bad guy).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Darth Vader was apparently sick and tired of being trapped in Fortnite's Battle Pass and is now waging war against all players. In a new update to the battle royale game, the Sith Lord is unleashed and he won't hesitate to take you down, but if you can take him out first, you'll get his lightsaber as a reward.
Vader appears in random places each match but is easy to locate since he arrives at the island at the same time as the players. When you are in the Battle Bus, look for an Imperial Shuttle. It'll enter the airspace just above the clouds and will quickly descend to a spot on the map. The Shuttle is highlighted with a blue glow for a few seconds after settling down on the surface.
Vader is one of the toughest bosses in the game and will take some serious firepower to take out. He's also flanked by two stormtroopers. He uses the Force in a variety of ways to mess with you and can block your shots. Your best bet is to attack him from afar with a sniper rifle or approach in a group. 
His lightsaber is a game-changer. You too can block shots with it, and it can also be thrown a decent distance to inflict big damage. Of course, you can swing it widely for melee strikes. We don't know how long Vader will be around or how he is influencing the story, but it's awesome to see him on the island dishing out punishment. Here's hoping more Star Wars integration is on the way soon!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[RiotPWR has revealed a new controller specifically designed for Xbox cloud gaming on mobile devices, and it looks great. 
RiotPWR is no stranger to creating controllers with mobile gaming in mind, but today’s reveal is the result of a collaboration and partnership with Xbox. The team set out to “develop and manufacture a full form-factor mobile gaming controller to enhance Xbox Cloud Gaming with high-quality, dedicated equipment,” and who better to work with on this than the people at Xbox. Dubbed the RiotPWR Mobile Controller for iOS (Xbox Edition), this controller is available to preorder starting today. RiotPWR will release it on Aug. 1 but if you preorder today, you’ll get 10% off the price. 


“The RiotPWR Mobile Controller for iOS (Xbox Edition) is Lightning-connected, therefore requires zero batteries or Bluetooth to use, and has a removable, adjustable phone mount display,” a press release from RiotPWR reads. “It also includes RiotPWR’s unique pass-through charging feature that allows users to charge their mobile device while using the controller without worrying about a low battery interrupting their game. Users can even record their gameplay with the push of a button and plug in headphones to fully immerse themselves in their games.” 
This controller is available to preorder today and will be released online and at various retailers on Aug. 1.

In Game Informer's review of Shadowrun Returns, Matt Miller says the "isometric view, turn-based combat, point-and-click controls, and text-driven dialogue deliver a jolt of nostalgia for longtime PC gamers.

While fans often debate the merits of modern Sonic the Hedgehog video games, the consensus is that the ‘90s were the franchise’s most consistently great years. Sonic Origins gathers the four games most attributed to that notion, delivering a stellar group of classic titles at its core. But through several modernizations and updates, Sonic Origins makes a strong case for being the best official way to experience Sonic’s heyday in 2022.

The decision to delay came a few days after Chinese microblogging site Sina Weibo banned the Diablo Immortal account due to unspecified "violation of related laws and regulations".

Don’t worry if you already own the game on Steam though, because you’ll still have access through Valve’s launcher. Here’s some bouncy Free For All update gameplay in the trailer below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last week Intel published a “quick start guide” for their upcoming Arc A-series graphics cards, including a “Supported Hardware Configurations” section that only specifically namechecked their own 10th, 11th and 12th Gen Core CPUs. Cue a heady mix of confusion and perturbation – surely Intel weren’t suggesting that Arc GPUs would only function when paired with an Intel CPU, and a relatively new one at that?


No, they weren’t, though the guide’s vague wording isn’t doing it – and worse, potential Arc users – any favours. Parts of the guide appear to conflate support for Resizable BAR with support for the Arc A-series in general, which further muddies things as Resizable BAR works on AMD Ryzen chips as well as those three Core CPU generations. I asked Intel directly for clarification and essentially, Arc GPUs won’t have such super specific CPU requirements just to run - though they’ll apparently perform better in systems that do support Resizable BAR.

As a bottom line, I’m not opposed to any remake. If a studio wants to take a new crack at an old game, especially if it’s the studio behind the original release, why not? It’s not like I have to buy the game, and who knows, it could be a new favorite for me. That’s what happened with FF7R. I love Final Fantasy 7, and I was worried the remake would not do it justice. Well, it turns out FF7R is one of my favorite games ever. Plus, at the end of the day, in many cases, the original game is still there for me to play should I wish to do that.

So today I carved out a small portion of the day to download and play the demo for Dome Keeper, a wave-based survival game about protecting your glass dome home from alien invaders using a gigantic laser.
Unfortunately, I ended up playing it a little too long, and now I've left myself no time at all to write about why it was so great. Argh. Let me try anyway.

The scepticism is understandable. But having gone hands-on with it at Summer Geoff Fest, I'd like to pose a counter argument: the game needs to be played. Just seeing it with your eyeballs doesn't do it justice. Yes, it's a weird departure for Sonic, but I am here for it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I didn't get to play as much at Steam Next Fest this weekend as I usually do, partly because I just ran out of time, and partly because the time I did have I spent playing Necrosmith. There were some demos I was meant to play for, like, actual work, and then I ran into a puzzle wall or a bug or something so I just fired up Necrosmith again.
Necrosmith is a 2D necromance 'em up that is also sort of a tower defence game. In the middle of the map is your evil lair, the Hall Of Bones, a sort of legally distinct Sauron's tower that gets more flying buttresses the more you upgrade it. If enemies (which can be packs of wolves or flying bugs or all manner of things) do enough damage to destroy it, you lose - so that's your defense bit. For the towers bit, you have to imagine that the towers can move on their own, and also that they're shambling undead monsters made from a jigsaw of different limbs you find, like an army of very unhygenic Mr Potato Heads.

The demo has cropped up among the top 50 on the most-played games on Steam over the weekend, and is currently nestled between Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord and Vampire Survivors. Not bad for a chill game about rewilding a barren planet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s been a wild month of video game announcements, updates, trailers, and more courtesy of June’s gaming showcase schedule. Between the 2022 Xbox & Bethesda showcase, Geoff Keighley’s Summer Game Fest, and the third-party PlayStation State of Play, people have been expecting Nintendo to announce its own June gaming direct. 
And it finally has, but it might not be the more general one you were expecting. That’s because Nintendo has revealed that a Xenoblade Chronicles 3 direct is happening this week. 
Tune in on 6/22 at 7am PT for a livestreamed #XenobladeChronicles3 Direct presentation featuring roughly 20 minutes of information about the upcoming RPG adventure for #NintendoSwitch. pic.twitter.com/x3pRs0EYRA
June 20, 2022
As you can see, this direct is not going to be the one many people were expecting; you know, the one where Nintendo discusses its plans for the rest of 2022 regarding the Switch. Instead, we’re getting 20 minutes of Nintendo’s next big release, Xenoblade Chronicles 3. If you’re excited about Monolith Soft’s upcoming RPG, then Wednesday is going to be your favorite day this week. 
While waiting for the direct, check out the reveal trailer of Xenoblade Chronicles 3 and then read about how its release date moved from September to July.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Evil West is the upcoming Wild West action game from developer Flying Wild Hog, the studio behind the fast-paced Shadow Warrior series, and it’s due out this September. It got an excellent trailer during both The Game Awards 2020 and The Game Awards 2021, as well as a new look during the past few weeks of video game showcases. 
Now, it’s back with a new trailer that highlights more than 10 minutes of rootin’ tootin’ western action, with plenty of vampires, of course, and it looks like a great time. If you’ve kept up with Evil West, then you likely already know its combat resembles that of 2018’s God of War, with the added bonus of guns. It’s just as brutal, with even more exploding gore. This trailer showcases a lot more of that and the wide variation of biomes we’ll be visiting, too, from western frontiers to strange caverns to foggy forests and more. 
Check it out for yourself below: 

As you can see, Evil West is looking like a fun time, and I can’t wait to check it out. If you’re unfamiliar with its premise, Flying Wild Hog describes it as “a third-person action game that puts you in the boots of a vampire hunter rescuing a Wild West devoured by darkness.” Flying Wild Hog will release Evil West on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on Sept. 20. 
For more, watch its debut trailer and then check out this gameplay showing from last December. After that, check out this vampire-infested release date trailer for Evil West.

That’s because apparently, the lyrics in most Elden Ring songs are completely gibberish and void of meaning. This news comes from Eurogamer, which discovered Reddit user Magister Organi, a student studying Latin, and their diligent attempted translation of the songs of Elden Ring. Organi confirmed that most of the lyrics are gibberish, and they even apparently reached out to an Elden Ring music producer to verify their findings.

Epic would like their Epic Games Store to also be wormy, and an early step is, hey, still about Steam. The Epic Online Services SDK 1.15, released this week, includes tools that let developers enable crossplay between players on Epic Games Store and players of the same game on Steam.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[First-person tactical shooter Ready Or Not disappeared from Steam on June 16th, prompting a flurry of rumours as to why. Now it's back and the developers say that the removal was because a "takedown request was issued via Steam concerning a suggested trademark infringement in our recent Night Club map."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Throwback first-person shooters are penny a bushel at the moment, but while most aim to replicate the boomsticks of Quake, Agent 64: Spies Never Die mimics the PPKs and hacking gadgetry of another 90's classic. Maybe the name gives it away: it's Rare's GoldenEye for the Nintendo 64, and there's currently a demo available to play as part of the Steam Next Fest.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let’s rock, baby! Season 6 of Video Gameography gets stylish as we examine the Devil May Cry series! Over the next few weeks, we’ll be covering the history and lore of Capcom’s premiere action franchise. This week we go all the way to hell with Dante as we unpack the mysterious low-point in the series, Devil May Cry 2.
Releasing a short 15 months after the release of Devil May Cry, Dante returns with a 2-disc adventure that’s more often than not seen as the worst game in the series, and there are very good reasons as to why it turned out that way. In this episode of Video Gameography, we talk about the tumultuous development cycle that didn’t include the team behind DMC, Team Little Devils. From an unknown first director to arcade-focused developers making their first console game and a late transition of direction, Devil May Cry 2 has all of the trappings of a project that would have been canceled. That is, if not for the man who would shepherd the series for years to come. 
Join hosts Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), John Carson (@John_Carson), along with Game Informer Editor-In-Chief Andrew Reiner (@Andrew_Reiner)

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/gamer-culture/2022/06/17/nerf-introduces-its-first-mascot-murph"/>
        <updated>2022-06-17T20:40:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nerf, the leading foam dart and water weapon manufacturer, has unveiled its first-ever mascot, which fittingly goes by the name Murph. Murph Nerfington (I gave them the last name) will represent the company as part of a multi-year marketing push in social media, public events, and more.
Murph looks like a Koosh mascot more than a Nerf representative, although that would still be under the Hasbro umbrella. However, if you look closely, you can see Murph is made entirely out of foam Nerf darts. The new character was created in association with a new summer initiative for the company to invite families to get out and play. Also, given the language of they/them pronouns in the mascot's announcement, Murph doesn’t have a set gender. So happy Pride month, Murph! The company even has a new mnemonic that Murph embodies, “Unleash the play in you.” I’m not sure what hard-to-remember topic this mnemonic is supposed to remind us of, but it’s a cute enough slogan nonetheless.
Below are a handful of promotional images of Murph handing some new Nerf weapons and looking like a late 2000s physics tech demo. 

In a press release shared with Game Informer, here’s what Adam Kleinman, senior vice president and general manager of Nerf, has to say to welcome Murph into existence: 
“The launch of Murph is a testament to the success of Hasbro’s Brand Blueprint strategy and turning Nerf into the social, active play brand it is seen as today. We are thrilled to introduce Murph to fans, a mascot that represents the playful spirit that lives inside us all and is unleashed through Nerf.”
If you see Murph around this summer, make sure to give them a nice cold spray from your Nerf Super Soaker. You'd be doing them a favor; it has to be hotter than hell in that suit.
Where on the mascot family tree do you think Murph belongs? Is it on the branch with Gritty, or maybe with AM/PM's Toomgis? How about with the McDonald's Fry Kids? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

I mean there's a Nacon showcase in July but, I mean come on now, we can't start classing events that occur outside of June as being part of the event formerly known as E3 can we? That would be preposterous. Before long it would spool out across the entire year, absorbing every month until E3 is a constant series of video events that could happen at any point.

You just never know what you might find, with some becoming the best thing since cubed diamonds and others getting left in a state of endless early-access jank. Partly to help you all avoid the duds and partly to satisfy my own morbid curiosity, I trawled through this Summer's Steam Next Fest demo list to test out a bunch. As you might expect, I got subjected to some chugging framerates and a bit of body horror, but also found some great multiplayer shooting in Dysterra and terrific tile-placement in Above Snakes, which might just become a new personal favourite.

As luck would have it, I managed to get hands-on with the game to confirm whether its substance does, in fact, match its style. Here are my findings.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in November, the Wall Street Journal reported that Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick was aware of some allegations of sexual misconduct among the company’s staff but did not inform the board of directors. Well, Activision Blizzard’s board issued a statement yesterday saying that "an objective review" from external advisors "determined the Board never intentionally ignored or attempted to downplay the instances of gender harassment that occurred and were reported”, and that there is no evidence "suggesting any attempt by any senior executive or employee to conceal information from the Board."
In fact, another, separate review of data concludes that "there was no widespread harassment, pattern or practice of harassment, or systemic harassment at Activision Blizzard or at any of its business units" in the United States between September 1st, 2016 and December 31st, 2021. Indeed, "based on the volume of reports, the amount of misconduct reflected is comparatively low for a company the size of Activision Blizzard."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Square Enix’s 25th anniversary livestream for Final Fantasy VII played out in almost textbook fashion for the JRPG giants, starting and ending with the two most important pieces of news for PC players. First up, Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade leaves Epic exclusivity to steer its motorbike onto Steam today. Steam Deck compatibility was touted too, you lucky beggars.


Then, after much faffing with mobile games and memorabilia, producer Yoshinori Kitase revealed footage from the second part of Remake, now known as Final Fantasy VII Rebirth. Kitase also confirmed that the Final Fantasy VII Remake saga might actually be completed in our lifetimes, thanks to Square Enix deciding to draw it to a close with a third, as yet untitled part. Gawp at Sephiroth’s broad shoulders from behind by watching the trailer below.

First, Capcom released a free update for Resident Evils 2, 3 and 7 Biohazard which introduced ray tracing and higher framerates. Unfortunately, the update also broke every existing mod for those games, with no quick fix available.

All's well that ends well, though. In response to "overwhelming community response", Capcom have made the previous versions of the games available again, so that those wishing to use mods can roll back if they wish.

Admittedly, "world record" is less impressive when only developers and media have played, and I expect to be toppled soon after it launches today. Point is: while writing this post about how much I adore the speedrunning FPS, several times I've had ideas about how I might make that record time even faster, so I've stopped writing, dropped into Neon White for a few minutes, and come back out with a new record. I adore this game, and I might never finish this post.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My biggest question about Starship Troopers Colon Terran Command was what tone it would strike. The RTS potential for an interplanetary ground war against overwhelming swarms of giant not-insects is obvious enough. But the dual spirit of most Paul Verhoeven films is a major reason that The Extraordinary Lust Of Dizzy (working title: Starship Troopers) still holds up 25 years on.


Terran Command understands that. Certainly it nods to the satire here and there, but mostly it focuses on the shooting and desperate defences and evacuations instead. This was the right decision. Though it's a little short on narrative flavour, unless you're really into exploring the setting, it's got enough tactical heft to make up for it.

At this year's Summer Geoff Fest, I caught up with Flynn for another quick chat. This time, we dug into the game's recently revealed card crafting and realm-hopping features, as well as the choices you might make along the way.

A story trailer for Farthest Frontier was shown at last weekend’s PC Gaming Show, which you can watch below.

        <id>https://www.scummvm.org/news/archive/#2022-06-05</id>
        <link href="https://www.scummvm.org/news/20220605/"/>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few months have passed since we released ScummVM 2.5.1.
No matter if you expect the scorching heat of the upcoming summer or freezing blizzards in winter (depending on your favorite hemisphere): it’s release time again!
Our lovely developers added support, yet again, for a bunch of new ancient games that require testing:
Sanitarium
Hades Challenge
Marvel Comics Spider-Man: The Sinister Six
The 11th Hour
Clandestiny
Tender Loving Care (CD-ROM Editions)
Uncle Henry's Playhouse
Wetlands
Chewy: Esc from F5
Besides these games, we’d appreciate it if you could check our release testing list - maybe you’ll even find your favorite game on there that has been sitting on that shelf for way too long.
And since ScummVM is about playing games in general, we’ve seen quite a bunch of changes across many, many engines - so this is the perfect time for giving your favorites another go.
The AGOS, SCI and SCUMM engine received some really extensive modifications which make all games using those engines very good testing targets as well.
All testing must be done with stable builds, not development ones. Please report any bugs or oddities on our issue tracker.
A detailed list of all exciting new features and fixes is available in our NEWS file.
Thank you very much for your support!
