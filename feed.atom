It appears The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom finally has some serious competition that could potentially take the 'Game of the Year' crown. As highlighted on social media, Larian Studios' latest PC release Baldur's Gate 3 has already skyrocketed to the top of Metacritic as the highest-rated game of 2023.
Yes, it's actually surpassed Tears of the Kingdom's critic score of '96' - receiving a score of '97', which sees it also enter the "top 25 highest-rated games ever" on the same website. Admittedly, it's still early days - with the score for Baldur's Gate 3 based on just 18 critic reviews right now, compared to Zelda which has been reviewed by 145 outlets.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Baldur's Gate 3 is a massive role-playing game, rife with decisions and choices that can come to a die roll. Consequences of a failed roll in Baldur's Gate 3 can ripple out across the game, ranging from small changes to big shifts in the story. And even though you've got modifiers and tools, you're still always beholden to the die.
To that end, I get why we are now rehashing the age-old save-scum debate. In some ways, it's a little silly; it's your game, so you should play it how you want.
What I would like to do, though, is encourage a few of you file perfectionists out there to embrace the failed roll. I come to you as a documented save-scummer myself—my XCOM Enemy Unknown and Fire Emblem files more than verify as much—saying that failure isn't just entertaining in Baldur's Gate 3.

Try out the Knuckledust weapon
Even though you start with the Dunecleaver and Sandwhip unlocked, you will obtain the Knuckldust very early. The Knuckldust is a fist weapon that can ramp up to deal massive damage.
I actually played through a fair portion of Atlas Fallen before trying out the Knuckledust. After giving it a try I never swapped it out, as it synergizes well with the Sandwhip. It may end up being your favorite weapon too.
When fighting multiple enemies at once, a good offense is a good defense

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this year, Destiny 2 and Horizon Zero Dawn (among many other roles) actor Lance Reddick passed away unexpectedly. In Destiny 2, Reddick played Commander Zavala – an important recurring character in Destiny lore. Reddick was also an outspoken fan of the game that engaged with the community often, so recasting his role was always going to be a difficult task.
Today, Bungie announced that legendary actor Keith David would be taking over the role. David is an accomplished film and television actor appearing in movies like The Thing and TV shows like Community (pictured below).
He has also voiced a number of characters in animated films and video games. He played Dr. Facilier in The Princess and the Frog and he played Keith David in Saint's Row IV. Perhaps his most famous video game role, however, is that of The Arbiter in Halo games. David is no stranger to working with Bungie.
In the post on Bungie's site announcing the casting, David said, "I am honored to continue the great work of Lance Reddick as Zavala. Lance captured the character's sense of integrity so wonderfully. It is my intention to continue that work."]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To say that Overwatch 2 has had a rough start to its lifecycle would be an understatement. After an absolute dearth of new content on the tail end of the original game's lifecycle, Overwatch 2 did little to regain favor with its community, thanks to polarizing changes to the game's structure and the cancellation of the highly anticipated Hero Missions. However, with Season 6, titled Invasion, the Overwatch 2 development team is making huge strides to release a content drop absolutely jam-packed with new modes, new maps, and even a new support hero. Following my exclusive look at Overwatch 2's Toronto Story Mission back in June, I was once again invited to go hands-on with Overwatch 2: Invasion – this time, with the entire Invasion update.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Taito and Inin have announced that a port of 2005 arcade title, Spica Adventure, is coming to Switch, PS4, PS5, and Xbox One sometime in Spring 2024.
Never heard of Spica Adventure? That’s not surprising, considering it was only released in Japanese arcades in 2005. It’s a twee sidescroller that is sometimes considered a spiritual successor to Parasol Stars: The Story of Bubble Bobble III (also with an upcoming port). You play as Nico, who beats the crap out of robots with a magical umbrella. It’s an interesting platformer in the classic arcade style that came out when that particular niche had gone all but extinct.
https://youtu.be/HP7rF_d8j64
This is really good news for another reason. It might mean Taito is eyeing some other Taito X board games that were never released outside of the arcade. Chase H.Q. 2, maybe? Or, heck, we could use a Chase H.Q. collection. It’s exciting to have Taito mining through its back catalog of arcade games with things like the Taito Milestones collections.
The arcade platform benefits heavily from preservation efforts. Even if there were home ports of a given game, they were often inaccurate. Because the hardware was often extremely different from game to game, emulation can be difficult, so some companies just don’t even bother. It’s nice when someone makes the effort.
Spica Adventure will be coming to Switch, PS4, PS5, and Xbox in Spring 2024. Physical editions for Switch, PS4, and PS5 will also be up for pre-order on November 14, 2023.

David is known for a variety of acclaimed performances, having appeared in Cloud Atlas, Pitch Black, and the Halo franchise. He will now continue Zavala's journey following the tragic news that the character's former actor, Lance Reddick, had passed away earlier this year.
The Destiny 2 community was hit with the news about Reddick last March, bringing his long tenure as the talent behind Destiny's Commander Zavala to an untimely end. Reddick was responsible for a substantial number of iconic video game, film, and TV show roles. The issue with Destiny, specifically, was that Bungie would need to recast Zavala moving forward or scrap the character entirely.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We're about two weeks away from the release of Armored Core 6: Fires of Rubicon. Those playing on Xbox who have preordered the game can preload Armored Core 6, letting you can play as soon as it releases. Unfortunately, PlayStation and PC gamers will have to wait a bit longer.
[caption id="attachment_395926" align="alignnone" width="640"] Image via Bandai Namco[/caption]
Armored Core 6 preload size
The download size when you preload Armored Core 6 on Xbox is about 53GB. This is a bit on the smaller side in comparison to games like the recently released Baldur's Gate 3, which ended up being about 122GB. However, FromSoftware has always managed to keep the file sizes of its titles in check.
For comparison, the massive open-world Elden Ring was under 50GB on consoles and only 60GB on PC. Dark Souls 3 was only 25GB on all platforms.
When we look at the file sizes of Elden Ring, Xbox as a platform was right in the middle. Therefore, it's possible the size of Armored Core 6 will be smaller on PlayStation and bigger on PC.
[caption id="attachment_395925" align="alignnone" width="640"] Image via Bandai Namco[/caption]
What about Armored Core 6 preload on PlayStation and PC?
Unfortunately, there's been no word on a pre-load date for Steam users on PC. Even though we don't have a date, typically Steam grants a couple of days of pre-load before a AAA release.
PlayStation players on the other hand will be able to pre-load Armored Core 6 starting on August 23, which is two days before it releases.
Armored Core 6: Fires of Rubicon releases on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S on August 25.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What are you reading this for? Nightdive’s rumored remaster of Quake II has been released, and you might already own it if you already had a version of Quake II on Steam or something. If the PC version is too good for you, then it’s also available on Xbox, Switch, and PlayStation platforms. What am I even writing this for?
Okay, because I’m expected to meet a certain word threshold to please the internet robots, I’ll tell you more. Bethesda and Nightdive dropped a remaster for the original 1996 Quake back in 2021, and it was an excellent source port of the classic game. It kind of felt like a similar Quake 2 remaster in the KEX Engine was an inevitability, but we only heard murmurings about it until today.
Quake 2 was initially released at the tail end of 1997, and featured a new, jazzed-up engine to take advantage of hardware acceleration. It wasn’t initially planned as a sequel to Quake, but gradually began shifting in that direction. Most notably, it has no narrative connection to the first game’s very loose story. Instead, it introduces a space war against the cyborg-like Strogg.
Quake is often considered to be the last game by id Software’s classic line-up. After some creative differences, a bunch of staff departed id, including John Romero. You can absolutely feel it in Quake 2, as it’s unusually cohesive for the studio. There was sort of a wild experimentation in early id games that kind of lags behind the technical wizardry in Quake II.
Okay, good enough? The Quake II remaster is now available on PC, Xbox, PlayStation, and Switch. It includes all its expansions, as well as a port of the N64 version’s campaign. Cool, bye!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Spread open your wallets, the Pokémon Center Store has unveiled a new 10 ¼ inch plush. This one depicts everyone’s favorite protrusion, Wiglett.
Numbered 960 on the National Pokédex, Wiglett was introduced in Pokemon Scarlet and Violet. While they resembled the shorter and more girthy Diglett, Wiglett is considered a different species rather than a regional variant. You can tell Wiglett apart by its much longer, slender length capped off by a red, nose-like tip.
The plush stands firmly at 10 ¼ inch length and 4 ¾ inches wide, which is quite a bit below average for your standard Wiglett. It’s held up by a large, sack-like base. Its long, pale shaft will no doubt delight company when you display it for all to see. The store page notes that its body is bendable, so it should stay rigid and erect as you pose it into different configurations. Meanwhile, its soft body invites you to take it into bed with you so you can spend all night together.
All in all, Wiglett is a perfect addition to anyone’s collection of Pocket Monsters. Judging by social media’s response, it is already being embraced by fans everywhere. It’s the perfect way to add some excitement to your evening.
The plush Wiglett is available now at the Pokémon Center shop for $24.99. Not for internal use.

Through happenstance and literal brainworms, you and the band of strange adventurers you meet in the first act are the only ones who can save the day. Don't worry, you don't need to remember or have played Baldur's Gate 1 or 2. So. Off you go, then.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Surprising few but delighting many, id Software and Bethesda have released a Quake 2 remaster to inaugurate this year's Quakecon. An enhanced edition of the 1997 game, it includes the mission packs The Reckoning and Ground Zero alongside a PC version of Quake 2 on N64. All that for £8 or $10, plus a brand new expansion titled Call of the Machine, developed by Wolfenstein: The New Order studio MachineGames.
While not as beloved or enduring as its predecessor or successor, Quake 2 is one of the Grand Old Shooters. I recall being introduced to it at a covert LAN party in a school IT room, plonking myself down at a monitor and instantly being reduced to a fine red mist (and in the game, etc). The singleplayer campaign had you scrapping across a muddy alien world with shotgun and hyperblaster, with larger levels than in the original Quake, and missions where you'd use heads as keys.

One of the ads featured musician Ozzy Osbourne, who also promoted the VR2 headset on Twitter. One of his tweets, posted on February 20, stated: “Did this spot with @Playstation team. We had a lot of fun. Their new VR2 is really amazing.” The tweet also included a PS VR2 video ad featuring Osbourne.
The seemingly innocuous message caught the attention of the UK's Advertising Standards Authority. The main complaint is that the tweet did not adequately identify itself as marketing material. On August 9, The ASA concluded that the “ad must not appear again in the form complained about.” Furthermore, Sony and Osbourne were also warned to “ensure that in future their ads were obviously identifiab…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Had you asked me yesterday about the best Baldur's Gate 3 class, I might have picked Bard - versatile, swish, a solid support both in and out of combat - but that was before I discovered the ancient and honourable Larian discipline of barrelmancy. As the name suggests, it's all about doing mildly game-breaking things with barrels, crates and other heavy containers, by taking advantage of high strength, the Throw command, and the fact that Larian RPG characters can somehow fit items as big as they are into their inventories, without bursting apart like rotten haggis.
A straightforward tactic: consider lugging a few oil barrels into a throne room, and dropping them all around the resident big cheese before you confront him. Given reasonably careful distribution, it's possible to finish a whole battle this way in a single turn. Fortunately, while Baldur's Gate NPCs can be eagle-eyed when it comes to sneaking rogues, they're perfectly indifferent to people surrounding them with heavy explosives.

Enchanted Portals, a 2D platformer heavily inspired by Cuphead, finally has a release date, four years after first being announced. Publisher Perp Games revealed that the game will be heading to Switch (including PC and other consoles) on 6th September 2023.
Initially gaining a bit of a reputation for looking a fair bit like its inspiration, Enchanted Portals has recently brought in a variety of art styles and level designs which hope to move away from the comparisons a little bit more. But in today's release date trailer, you can certainly see the throughline, with similar jumping and shooting animations along with that handdrawn-esque art style.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ravenage Games has announced that Königsborgs’ card-based restaurant-slash-mafia sim Don Duality will be released on August 25th.
Don Duality has you in the shoes of a newly empowered mob boss.  You have to juggle both the demands of organized crime and your money-laundering restaurant front. It uses a card-driven system that takes you through the difficult crime-slash-dining events as you build up both empires. You’re tasked with equipping your crew and keeping your customers happy while restoring your family to their rightful place in the criminal underground.
I’ve said this before, but Don Duality reminds me of the Pizza Connection games. They both connect organized crime with restaurant management, which is a pretty tantalizing mix. In Pizza Connection, you would send goons to sabotage and steal from your other competitors, which I don’t think is what this game is going for. We can hope, though.
Or you could just check out the prologue demo, Don Duality: Initiation. I meant to do that, but I only really play demos for work, and I never got around to it. I’ve enjoyed a good few deckbuilding games recently, love management games, and also do a lot of crime, so this looks up my alley. Maybe it’s up your alley too. You can talk to me. I won’t tell the cops.
Don Duality releases on PC on August 25, 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let's face it: If it weren't for the modding community, games like Fallout 4 probably wouldn't still be a major part of the AAA gaming world. Despite the Bethesda RPG coming out in 2015, it's still getting plenty of love, as evidenced by this one modification that fixes load times.
Thanks to Nexus Mods user Antonix35, you can now enjoy speedier loading times with their Fallout 4 plugin. As well as making the game load faster in general, the mod also fixes "in-game vertical sync for high frame rate monitors," adds in the ability to "select loading screens," and more.
https://youtu.be/bfEcyRJ4Bo0
The modder says the whole thing works by "speeding up slow locations in game code that are slowing down other loading threads." Now, I don't know much about the inner workings of modding so that means nothing to me. However, some of you out there will have a better understanding of what Antonix35's Long Loading Times Fix does. I mean, it works!
The proof of the pudding is in the loading
Just to make sure that we get an idea of just how fast Fallout 4's load times are now, a video has been provided that shows the mod in action.
A timer in the corner displays how much quicker it is now to fast travel between locations and other loading zones. Some of the times are now just a couple of seconds. The quickest one seen in the clip is when the player enters an internal location at Diamon City, which clocks in at 0.64 seconds.
In fact, the longest time we get to see is when the game itself is loaded up at the start. It takes just over eight seconds to boot up the save file, which is still pretty impressive.

This week's Japanese charts are in from Famitsu (via Gematsu) and we are once again seeing Nintendo's latest big release top the competition, as Pikmin 4 lands in first place for the third week in a row.
The plant-plucking RTS game sold another 78,838 copies this time around, comfortably beating Tears of the Kingdom in second place on 14,673. There are no new releases this time around, though last week's silver medalist, Natsu-Mon! 20th Century Summer Vacation, has fallen ever so slightly down to fourth as the unstoppable force that is Mario Kart 8 Deluxe speeds into the top three.

In this full release, there are now three episodes in total, all with new guns, enemies and the like. There's also a multiplayer mode and mod support to round things off. All of this begs the question: does its 1.0 release cling onto its Bestest Best badge?

I mean, I guess it does have the Undead Nightmare DLC and the Game of the Year bonus content, but you can get all of that and more for much cheaper on other platforms. The Switch version (alongside the upcoming PS4 edition) also does not include multiplayer capabilities. In any case, the choice is yours.
Moving Out 2 is the other major release, and that's out on August 15. This is a day-and-date release with other platforms, which is always nice to see. Oh, and there are tons of other things out if you want to comb through the below list!

        <link href="https://www.destructoid.com/tekken-8-wont-have-denuvo-according-to-katsuhiro-harada/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=tekken-8-wont-have-denuvo-according-to-katsuhiro-harada"/>
        <updated>2023-08-10T13:30:30.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The highly anticipated Tekken 8 recently caused a stir among fans when they noticed that the End User License Agreement on Steam made mention of the controversial anti-tamper software Denuvo. Fortunately, game director Katsuhiro Harada took to Twitter to announce he has “no plans to introduce Denuvo or anything else.”
https://twitter.com/Harada_TEKKEN/status/1688677772116504576
According to Harada, the mention of Denuvo is likely because the EULA is a copy of Tekken 7’s. Although Harada’s Tweet isn’t a definitive confirmation that Tekken 8 won't use the anti-tamper software, it is a good sign.
[caption id="attachment_394394" align="alignnone" width="640"] Screenshot by Destructoid[/caption]
Tekken 8 could avoid some of Tekken 7’s problems
Developers use Denuvo to prevent (or at least stall) games from being cracked and pirated. Ideally, it shouldn't affect gameplay. Nevertheless, both players and developers have previously complained about the anti-tamper software, with some developers eventually removing it from their games. Denuvo has acknowledged the negative press, though the issues surrounding it continue.
Tekken 7 was well recieved when it released in 2015. However, it did suffer from frame rate drops and other performance issues on PC. Harada attributed this to the game’s anti-tamper software, which happened to be Denuvo. This naturally explains why fans felt upset about the mention of Denuvo in Tekken 8's EULA, and why Harada is so adamant on avoiding it.
https://twitter.com/Harada_TEKKEN/status/984835707209375744
Though Harada has suggested players “sit quietly”, impatient fans have been exploiting the Closed Network Test to play beyond the test period. Tekken 8 will release on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S, though it has yet to receive a release date.

The nearest I've come to doing so is that one episode of the Simpsons. The major things I am given to understand about it are that it is very confusing, sexy in a ghoulish way, and 100% comprised of memes in the same way that Hamlet has retrospectively become a book's worth of quotations.
I have, however, played a surprising number of very decent games that are influenced by Twin Peaks - Zelda: Link's Awakening, Silent Hill and the amazing Lone Survivor, to pick a few that I know about for sure. So who knows, perhaps I won't be utterly bamfoodled and confluzzled by Twin Peaks: Into The Night, an unofficial PS1-style adaptation of the game that has just surfaced on Itch.

Marble It Up! spun onto our Switch screens back in 2018, and the updated Ultra version expands on the kaleidoscopic first release while remaining a joy to play through if you love well-rounded arcade games. It's part sequel, part update — owners of the original Marble It Up! will be happy to know that they can download Ultra for free, and Ultra fans who want to investigate the original will be able to download that for free as well.
Right off the bat, this game is bright, colorful, and packed full of synth-heavy music. Despite the myriad of neon tones immediately thrown at you, the interface here is clean and simple to navigate, presenting a wide variety of ways to play and a marble-rolling game (a "roll-playing game" according to the PR — c'mon, that's not bad!) that's easy to get into.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lords Of The Fallen is a curious sequel/reboot of the 2014 Lords Of The Fallen. It takes the Soulslike credentials of the original, gives them a grittier makeover, a much bigger world, and a magical lantern that reveals a gnarlier version of the universe you can actually step into.
Having spent roughly 90-minutes with the game, I'd say it has strong Dark Souls 2 energy mixed with a realm-hopping gimmick that's surprisingly impressive. While it's definitely too early to make big claims, I could see LOTF as a genuine competitor in the saturated Soulslike arena.

The first Lords of the Fallen released in 2014, a time when From Software’s Dark Souls series consisted of two games. Bloodborne wasn’t out, and Elden Ring hadn’t yet redefined what the action-RPG genre can be. Lords of the Fallen was among the first Soulslikes to appear on my radar. It didn’t hit for me and I put it down after a few hours. It was slow, clunky, and allowed for little wiggle room in gameplay style. I yearned for the flexibility of Dark Souls’ various classes and the speed some of them allowed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been bolting together some ideas for a longer Starfield feature and while plying the sliplanes of Reddit, stumbled on this conversation about the game's handling of time. As many of you will know/be very weary of hearing, Starfield features hundreds of planets, together with moons and space stations, scattered around the galaxy in different solar systems. Real-life planets, of course, aren't fixed points: they rotate and orbit their stars at different speeds, depending on their mass and distance, which means that days, nights and seasons have different durations. 


Starfield appears to model this to some degree. Bethesda's Starfield Direct from June makes a fleeting distinction (thanks, JuiceHead33) between "local time", corresponding to where you land on a planet's surface, and "UT", which sounds like an abbreviation of "universal time", and presumably describes the passage of time throughout the wider galaxy. Both are displayed in 24 hour format. You can explore planet locations at different local times, as indicated by your fancy neo-Casio watch, with shifting lighting conditions that seem to correspond to the spinning of the planet around its sun. There's footage showing one particular area, The Hitching Post in Akila City, by day and night. The game also seems to model planetary alignments - there's the beginnings of a solar eclipse visible during one segment of the video.

We'll add a micro NSFW warning at the top here, although please bear in mind that The Pokémon Company itself has these images on its Pokémon Center site — they're not graphic or anything like that! Just incredibly, surprisingly suggestive. Passers-by catching a glimpse of your screen may well get the impression you're browsing for a different sort of product than a Pokémon plush, so take that as your warning.

We remember our elation when Pokémon Scarlet and Violet's weird little worm guy, Wiglett, was first revealed in a trailer all of his own. This water type was cute and harmless and you would be forgiven for thinking that he might one day make for an adorable plush. But thinking about this prospect for more than 30 seconds, you'd surely see how that could be a bad idea, right? Apparently not.

Pokémon Scarlet & Violet's Paradox Pokémon are an undoubted highlight of Gen 9. Depending on what version of the game you're playing, you'll be able to encounter Ancient or Future Pokémon — Pokémon that look like ones you've encountered in previous games, but are either distant past or future versions of that Pokémon.
There are some pretty amazing Paradox Pokémon in the base game — Slither Wing is a ground slug take on Volcarona, and Iron Valiant blends Gardevoir and Gallade together in sleek, terrifying metallic form. But yesterday, during the Pokémon Presents August 2023 showcase, we got a look at two brand new Paradox 'mons coming in The Indigo Disk (part two of The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero).

Previously, 8BitDo released wireless adapters for SNES, NES, and Genesis consoles. These allow you to connect any 8BitDo controller, as well as many different modern ones, to a classic console. I personally have ones for my SNES and Genesis, which I use for my SF30 Pro and M30 controllers. My dog hates cords, for some reason, and won’t cross the living room if one is on the floor, so this sort of thing is just convenient for him.
8BitDo doesn’t currently have a controller that strictly emulates the look and feel of an original DualShock, but the Pro 2 controller comes pretty close. If that’s still too far off, you can connect a DualShock 4 or Dualsense. DualShock 4 sounds like the obvious choice for me, but they also list the Wii U Pro controller as compatible, which I’m a fan of. However, this also means I can use my arcade stick for some Bloody Roar.
Some people are wondering about how it will work with games that use the PS2’s pressure-sensitive buttons, but the press information I’ve read doesn’t really address this. My guess is that it won’t. This might cause some issues for some games like 2000’s The Bouncer. However, I usually forget this feature even exists until I run up against it.
Hopefully, now that the PS1 is out of the way, 8BitDo will be quick to bring about adapters for the N64, Sega Saturn, and Turbografx-16.
It appears that the 8BitDo retro receiver for PS1 and PS2 is available right now from their website for $24.99 USD.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hooded Horse has announced that they’ll be handling publishing duties for Feryaz Beer’s roguelite city-builder, Super Fantasy Kingdom. It’s currently set to arrive in 2024.
Super Fantasy Kingdom has you rebuilding your destroyed settlement in a rush to defend it from approaching hordes. You build your town, recruit your defenders, and make sure they’re fed. You shore up your defenses as best you can, and then between “runs” you unlock upgrades and progress in other ways that allow you to put up a better fight the next time around. There’s also an exploration element to it that is also accomplished under the cloud of impending doom.
https://youtu.be/1c9zpE38pXc
I was somewhat skeptical about the concept of Super Fantasy Kingdom at first, but the more I look into it, the more I think I’d really like it. The hordes of enemies remind me a lot of Vampire Survivors, and city building is one of my favorite digital past times. It’s looking like a lightweight and compelling approach to all its established genres. It also says it’s “chill” but it looks to me like you’re constantly juggling tasks to try and keep up.
I guess I could always check out the demo that is available to find out more. And so could you!
Super Fantasy Kingdom is currently slated to arrive on PC sometime in 2024. The current plan is to drop in Early Access initially and grow from there.

Rune Factory fans will be celebrating in just under a month's time, as Rune Factory 3 Special will be launching on Switch on 5th September in the West. This remaster of the popular DS title from 2009 brings back many fan's favourite entry in the "Fantasy Harvest Moon" series, gives the game a fresh lick of paint, and adds a few more features.
Ahead of the game's release next month, we've been able to spend time with a preview build of the game.

While overall it shares some similarities to their previous title, including Lords of the Fallen and The Surge 2, it's also their first step away from the Soulslike genre. At its core Atlas Fallen is a third-person action RPG that focuses on speed and fast-paced encounters. While you sometimes encounter groups of smaller enemies, the bulk of your enemies is giant hulking beasts, which quickly becomes a staple of the gameplay.

Ultimate Team might have just been one of the most popular modes in the FIFA series, and it looks like EA is keen to carry that on in EA Sports FC 24 as it has today revealed some of the new features that we can expect from the upcoming title's team-builder mode.
There are a couple of big changes that we will see this time around to switch up the FIFA formula. Perhaps the most notable of these is that women's football is being added to the game mode, allowing you to combine players from both leagues on the same pitch. This is something that we have known about since the original reveal trailer, but today's deep dive explained that the chemistry bonus will still work exactly the same regardless of whether that player is from men's or women's leagues and that a fresh batch of icons is coming our way too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A Koality sequel.
Back in 2020, Chibig released Summer in Mara, a slice-of-life farm sim game set in a tropical world and… well, for our money, it really wasn’t very good. It evidently sold well enough for Chibig to justify continuing the IP, but rather than make a sequel that built on the strengths and fixed the flaws of the original, the studio decided to make the successor a 3D platformer in the vein of Super Mario 3D Land or Sackboy: A Big Adventure. Bizarre as the choice may seem, it was clearly the right one, as Koa and the Five Pirates of Mara is a substantially better game than its predecessor and holds its own as a solid 3D platformer.
The story begins sometime after the events of Summer in Mara and centers around a competition staged by a local band of pirates wherein competitors must overcome a series of trials to become an official pirate. Koa naturally enters the competition, starting off another seafaring adventure as she island-hops and collects maps on her climb to be the very best. The narrative isn’t much to write home about, and it can get awfully text heavy in some places as you’re nagged by side characters grabbing Koa’s attention, but it mostly stays out of the way.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Japanese pre-order bonuses detailed.
Detective Pikachu Returns was one of the highlights of the Pokémon Presents August 2023 showcase, and with more information about the long-awaited sequel to the 3DS cult favourite, pre-order bonuses in Japan have also been revealed, and we're mighty jealous.
Brewing over on the official Japanese Pokémon website (via Nintendo Wire), early purchases of Detective Pikachu Returns will include an exclusive Pokémon Trading Card, which features the coffee-loving hard-boiled detective riding the back of his partner Growlithe. The art is adorable, and we really hope this card makes its way over to the West in some capacity.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's a lot of contention at the moment regarding the re-release of Red Dead Redemption. Some fans are not pleased about Rockstar charging $50 for a PS4 port of a 13-year-old game, but Take-Two's CEO doesn't appear to agree with them.
Speaking to IGN, Strauss Zelnick has justified the need to charge almost full price for RDR1 on the previous-gen system. In a statement, he said it's "what we believe is the commercially accurate price for it."
https://twitter.com/RockstarGames/status/1688552977508806656
He was asked whether the inclusion of the Undead Nightmare DLC was the reason for the $50 price tag. Zelnick responded by saying it was a "great standalone game in its own right when it was originally released, so we feel like it's a great bundle for the first time, and certainly a great va…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot, which arrived at the very start of 2020, is still getting DLC. You know how DBZ games go!
This one is called "Ground Battle," and it's billed as the fifth major DLC for the game. As the name might suggest, you're literally fighting on the ground here, which is a Godsend given how flight-heavy the game is in general. It's silly that this is the focus of a DLC three and a half years after the game's release (and not as part of the base package), but it's here all the same. Sometimes Dragon Ball Z games (or Bandai Namco anime brawlers in general) can give EA Sports titles a run for their money!
Here's a full description of the DLC from Bandai Namco:
"Unleash your power in a new stage, 'Ground Battle' of Dragon Ball Z Kakarot's DLC 5! Experience intense fights with unique rules in the World Tournament. Master epic moves, defeat your foes, and rise to victory! Get ready for non-stop action!'

While Ground Battle was announced several weeks ago, it just got an official date thanks to Bandai Namco's German Twitter account: August 17.
A short history of Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot DLC
Note that this is all part of the "second battle pass" for the game. The first concluded in June of 2021 with a Trunks-focused DLC, with the second season pass arriving in early 2023. Ground Battle is the second add-on for the second pass (what is this, the 2010s?), and the third and final DLC will presumably come out sometime later in 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dystopian border control simulator Papers, Please turns 10 years old this week, and developer Lucas Pope has marked the occasion by demaking it. Created in collaboration with Keiko Pope, the resulting browser-based LCD, Please "runs" on a mocked-up LCD console, akin to Nintendo's Game & Watch. Pope is also celebrating the anniversary by donating $100,000 to the International Rescue Committee.
The demake gives you the simplified strokes of the celebrated 2013 game: you're a border control officer, approving or denying entry to the fictional country of Arstotzka, which boils down to checking mugshots and bios against faces that, in this rendition, call to mind Rorschach blots. The representation of an LCD screen with "baked-in" graphics is impressive - I had to fight the urge to tilt my computer to catch the sunlight while playing.

Overall, Take-Two is in a strong position, kicking off its financial year with a net booking of $1.2 billion, as chairman and chief officer Strauss Zelnick stated in a conference call. The Red Dead franchise is highlighted, with Zelnick revealing that Red Dead Redemption 2 has sold over 55 million copies. Grand Theft Auto 5 and NBA 2K23 also receive a spotlight here. According to Zelnick, they exceeded the company’s expectations, proving the “long-lasting benefits of producing the highest-quality offerings.”

Older fans know him as Vladimir Makarov, the side antagonist in 2009's Modern Warfare 2 and the primary threat in 2011’s MW3. He’s set to take that head villain mantle once again in the third entry of the rebooted trilogy, and a trailer appropriately paints him as the boogeyman set to make Captain Price and Co.’s lives a living hell. The trailer also teases a full reveal of the game on August 17.

Videoverse, the excellent homage to early 00s internet forums and Nintendo's Miiverse that came out earlier this week, doesn't have spine-filled book shelves, per se, but throughout the game you will see a collection of game magazines piling up on Emmett's desk, and readers, let me tell you, they are a delight.

As a huge musical theatre fan, the idea of a musical game in Stray Gods is an exciting idea.
Add on the fact that David Gaider, one of the lead writers for two of my favorite games in Star Wars: Knights of the Republic and Dragon Age: Origins, is working on the project as part of his co-founded rookie indie studio Summerfall Studios, and it's promising.
Stray Gods' cinematic indie visual novel-style is unique, complementing gorgeous 2D character designs with solid voice acting, and a sometimes skippable but still noteworthy soundtrack. The result is an incredibly unique adventure …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Scan the cast list for Stray Gods and you may notice a fair bit of overlap with that of The Last Of Us. Both Troy Baker (Joel) and Ashley Johnson (Ellie) appear in key supporting roles here, while star billing goes to Laura Bailey, aka Abby from Naughty Dog’s sequel. Obviously, this means Stray Gods has some top-notch voice talent on board, but these casting choices also make another kind of sense. The premise of this 'roleplaying musical' is inspired by the Buffy the Vampire episode 'Once More With Feeling', you see, and as in that piece of classic TV, part of the appeal is seeing (or hearing) performers who famously earn a crust in more action-oriented roles forced to prove their singing chops instead.
Thankfully, The Last Of Us crew all have a finely tuned set of pipes on them, not least Bailey, and the notes they belt out absolutely do this game’s charming and entertaining concept justice. Even better, they’re ably backed by the admirable composing skills of Austin Wintory, a fizzy script and pitch-perfect character design.

I'm a fan of musicals of all kinds. From Hamilton to La La Land to Bob's Burgers, if the characters in your story burst into song, I'm more than likely on board. For this exact reason, Stray Gods: The Role-Playing Musical caught my eye, exciting both my inner fan of musicals and my inner fan of games.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Xbox Game Pass is no doubt worth the monthly cost, especially since you can get a trial version of it for $1. However, said trial has now had its length slashed, and some may think it a strange coincidence this has happened just before Starfield gets released.
Turns out, instead of a cheap introductory offer that provides access to the Xbox gaming service for one month, you now only get half the time. First spotted by Kotaku reporter Ethan Gach over on Twitter, the Game Pass trial now only lasts two weeks.
https://twitter.com/ethangach/status/1688888019141500929
Indeed, if you head over to the Xbox Game Pass page, you can see that 14 days is all you'll get now for that first dollar. After that, you'll be paying the full rate.
Is Starfield the reason?
We can't say for certain why the trial period has been halved, but with Starfield just around the corner, this could be one of the reasons.
Seeing as Bethesda's much-anticipated sci-fi RPG will be on Game Pass from day one, it's possible Microsoft doesn't want people playing it for just $1. The game launches on September 6, so the new trial of the Xbox service would end long before it launches.
This is just speculation, of course, but you'd be hard-pressed to find anyone who didn't think Starfield had something to do with the reduced trial period. The fact that it's not been mentioned on the official Game Pass Twitter page makes it seem like this change was done on the quiet.
In any case, now you'll only get the first 14 days for the introductory $1 price tag. That includes the Ultimate and PC packages as well, according to the website.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While the recent August 2023 Pokemon Presents stream was a disappointment for some, Scarlet & Violet fans at least had a little bit to chew on. Amid the announcement that this generation's first expansion was just around the corner, we also got word that Mewtwo would be coming to the game in September via a Tera Raid event. That's neat at least!
Before that actually happens, you can do some extra prep work if you're not ready to go. The good news is that The Pokemon Company is making that easy with an event that's live right now through the next week or so: so even lapsed players can dive in without having to make up for weeks (or months) of lost time.
All the info on the August 9 through August 17 Pokemon Scarlet and Violet Tera Raid event
From now through August 17, you'll be able to catch three Pokemon designed to counter Mewtwo. You can find all of the event info here on the official Japanese Pokemon site.
Here are the three Pokemon you can catch:
Blissey
Scizor
Hydreigon
As you may have noticed from all the fanfare, all three of these will help you take out Mewtwo in some form as part of a larger party. You'll also get stat-raising items, as well as TMs that will help you conquer the psychic-wielding creature.
If you're on vacation or missed out, there's another event on the way
If you missed the first round of the event through August 17, you can still catch the second-chance one that runs from September 1 through September 17. Conveniently, that's when the Mewtwo event is running as well!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm still stupidly early on in my Baldur's Gate 3 journey - I did, after all, spend several hours replaying the start to see how different origin characters worked - but last night I had my first real run-in up at the chapel near where you crash land in the big nautiloid. I'd played this bit before in early access, so I knew to fireball the tiny bit of rope to drop the big stone down into the floor and take out the rest of the bandits hanging about up there pretty sharpish. But before I went down beneath the chapel (there were a lot of other nasty bandits down there last time I checked), I had a little extra nose around the outside, eventually discovering a locked hatch down a nearby cliff path that took me to the brilliantly named Dank Crypt.
Sensing not all was well down here, I went into hiding mode and gingerly crept around the place, looting the handful of corpses lying about of their gold and spell scrolls, but leaving their weapons. You see, I have a terrible habit in RPGs of stuffing my pockets with absolutely everything I can find. In Bioshock, I will scavenge everything out of every bin like some feral raccoon; in Skyrim, I had to enable a cheat code for infinite storage one time because I was so overencumbered (and couldn't bear to part with everything I'd picked up over the course of the quest) that I actually couldn't move. And in my early hours of Baldur's Gate 3, I started doing exactly the same thing, looting everyone's swords, daggers and crossbows up on the Nautiloid. Not to much effect, mind. Nothing was really that much better than what I already had. So I resolved to do better and resist temptation. And what a dumb idea that turned out to be...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you haven't bought a Steam Deck because of the price, you're in some semblance of luck. It turns out that Valve is now selling refurbished models of its handheld gaming PC at discounted prices.
The information was confirmed on the official Steam Deck Twitter page recently. Indeed, if you head over to the store page itself, you can now get repaired versions of any of the three variations of the device.
https://twitter.com/OnDeck/status/1688972619880804352
According to the tweet, supplies are limited, but they have been "fully tested" and still come with a one-year warranty. At the time of writing, the store page is currently out of the 64GB model, so they do seem to be going fast.
Currently, they are priced at $319 (£279) for the 64GB version, $419 (£369) for 256GB, and $519 (£459) for 5…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The latest Baldur's Gate 3 patch is out, and all anybody will talk about are the buggy invisible gnome underpants and the penises clipping through clothing. Larian themselves highlighted it in their patch notes, and the socials have predictably gone wild with talk of girthy githyankis. Well, some of us like to think of ourselves as serious journalists, thank you very much, so I'd like to call your attention to the, dare I say, more grown-up elements of the patch, which range from fine-tuning the tooltips to making dragons appear in the right place.


Tear your eyes from those lurid details of absentee knickers and glitchy sausages, and you'll see that Larian has fixed no less than 13 crash bugs and progress blockers, though sadly not the crash bug I always seem to get when I run the game in DirectX 11. They've also sorted out an issue with enemies entering combat when they're on a different floor, together with the occasional odd prolonged silence in over 200 dialogues, and a smattering of minor issues with cameras and clipping. See, this is the stuff video game news is rightly made of. None of your adolescent leering, thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You might already know that first-person fantasy RPG Avowed began life as Obsidian's take on Skyrim, but did you know that it was originally pushed as a multiplayer game, prior to being acquired by Microsoft? That's according to studio head and founder Feargus Urquhart, speaking in the latest and final episode of the Obsidian 20th Anniversary documentary, which is chock-a-block with intriguing factoids from throughout the studio's history.


"One of the things I really pushed was that Avowed was going to be multiplayer," Urquhart said. "And I kept on that for a long time. And I think in the end - not 'I think', I know, in the end, it was the wrong decision to keep on pushing on it. Now [the reason I did it] was when we still independent and we were selling it, it was a more interesting game to publishers. And when you're asking for $50, $60, $70, $80 million, you have to have something interesting to talk about. And multiplayer made it interesting. It was this idea of sort of the peanut butter and chocolate, putting it together - it must be something that's good."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rockstar's original Red Dead Redemption can seem rather humble next to the rootin' tootin' excellence of Red Dead Redemption 2, but it looms larger in my memory, albeit not for the best reasons. The original Xbox 360/PS3 game launched with a tidal wave of bugs, some of them game-ending. One particular collection of technical gremlins trapped me on a farm during the prologue. Having sat through some cutscenes, I found myself at the centre of a strange spacetime distortion redolent of the other world in Neil Gaiman's Coraline. If I tried to leave the farm the simulation slowly broke down, with movement consisting of weird fragmentary teleports. 
I saw a distant rider stop-starting through a canyon with his own hat darting through the air behind him. I followed the man for as long as I could, before tumbling through the terrain into uncreated space. Proper Lynchian stuff. Red Dead Redemption 2 had its share of bugs and glitches, but none of them quite as captivating as this. Still, it would have been nice to see the world beyond the farm, and that was my first thought when Take-Two Interactive and Rockstar announced a new Red Dead Redemption port, for release on 17th August. Sadly, however, the port appears to be PS4 and Switch-only for the moment, though a PC release might happen if the stars align.

Developers with the studio come from some big franchises including Far Cry, Borderlands, and Call of Duty. Even though the shooter doesn't release until 2024, the team plans to host frequent open-access weekends until launch. While most shooters put the story on the backburner, Cathedral Studios wants to make it a big part of The Bornless.
"We aspire to lead in technology, but for us, the story holds paramount importance," stated Toby Saunders, CEO at Cathedral Studios. "We've strived to weave an immersive, captivating narrative while ensuring an enjoyable gaming experience."
We also got an Early Access Launch trailer highlighting the creepy goodness that The Bornless has to offer:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In case you haven’t heard, Baldur’s Gate 3 is pretty hot right now. Our own Eric “Blast Man” Van Allen is loving what he’s played of it so far, noting that it showcases “a clear love for the role-playing craft at its heart.” Now, that’s all well and good for those who live and breathe D&D. But what about those of us who know basically nothing about Dungeons & Dragons outside of the existence of dungeons and–I’m going out on a limb for this one– possibly some dragons? Well, we've got a Baldur's Gate 3 guide for you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5Wx7eFMGkY
Our video team is here to help. In “Ultimate Beginner's Guide for Baldur's Gate III,” even total newbies will learn how to navigate the game’s early hours. This includes tips like how to build your character, and how to warm up shopkeepers with your spare garbage. As a total D&D newbie, even I felt like I could succeed in Baldur’s Gate 3 after watching this. Whether you’re here for the information or some silly jokes, you should find something to like here.
Of course, this comes hot on the heels of our ongoing Baldur’s Gate 3 coverage. Eric “Sticky Hands” Van Allen shared his own 10 tips for Baldur’s Gate 3, which contains unique tidbits you’ll want to read. He also shared some thoughts about how much Act 1 has changed since the game’s early access build (spoilers: it’s a fair amount). Expect to hear more from us about Baldur’s Gate 3, especially as we make our way through this massive title.

What are the settings that most of us immediately change to fit our needs and taste as soon as we try out a new game? We've gathered a few of our go-to's here.

Mindful that his injunction is being ignored, a U.S. judge has just held the persistent pirate in contempt of court and declared MG Premium the new owner of his pirate domains.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This Patch Tuesday brings a new and potentially painful processor speculative execution vulnerability... Downfall, or as Intel prefers to call it is GDS: Gather Data Sampling. GDS/Downfall affects the gather instruction with AVX2 and AVX-512 enabled processors. At least the latest-generation Intel CPUs are not affected but Tigerlake / Ice Lake back to Skylake is confirmed to be impacted. There is microcode mitigation available but it will be costly for AVX2/AVX-512 workloads with GATHER instructions in hot code-paths and thus widespread software exposure particularly for HPC and other compute-intensive workloads that have relied on AVX2/AVX-512 for better performance.]]></summary>

I've never played Dead By Daylight - going by my Among Us stats, I make a pretty shambolic assassin and besides, the whole impale-people-on-hooks sacrifice mechanic is just so urrrgh - but I will always play an Alien game, and Behaviour's take on the xenomorph is intriguing.

Five years ago, when he was invited to a pre-GDC meeting to pitch game ideas to an unnamed friend, Wintory had one that really excited him. It was a musical game – not just a game with musical numbers distributed throughout, but where the player has control over the music itself. Wintory's friend was less than enthusiastic.
"He said very graciously, but in no uncertain terms, 'I hate that idea, and I want nothing to do with that,'" Wintory recalls. He smiles as he tells the story, finding humor in the irony that this rejected pitch eventually became the game I'm currently interviewing him about.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sega have formally unveiled the next steaming helping of Total Warhammer 3 DLC, Shadows of Change, which adds three Legendary Lords to this already-jam-packed strategy game: the Changeling for the demonic Tzeentch faction, Yuan Bo for Grand Cathay, and Mother Ostankya for Kislev, plus a brace of new campaign mechanics, units and battlefield abilities. 
I've been going off Total War lately - I fired up a new Lizardman game last month, having developed a hankering for dinos after reviewing Exoprimal, and found myself lingering in disappointment on each faction's reliance on rock-paper-scissors unit relationships. There's only so many times you can do that dance of shieldwalls before it loses its charm. Still, it sounds like the new Tzeentch Lord might wash away my Total Warennui, in being one of those playstyles that is more about tricking and invading rivals than taking territory.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today's Pokémon Presents gave us lots of updates on upcoming Pokémon titles, like Detective Pikachu Returns, the classic games coming to Switch Online, and even new raids for Mewtwo in Scarlet and Violet. However, none of those updates were as substantial as the one we got on the upcoming Scarlet and Violet DLC, with the showcase spending ten minutes of its 35-minute runtime to reveal new Pokémon, new areas, and even a release date. Here's everything you need to know about Pokémon Scarlet and Vilet: The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero.


We knew that one of the expansions, The Teal Mask, would be coming in the fall – but now we know the exact date. On September 13, you'll be able to leave the Paldea region and explore the area around Kitakami Village, which is where the DLC takes place. Accor…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you were looking forward to playing the pro-wrestling-themed RPG WrestleQuest today for its launch, it looks like that card was subject to change. The game has suffered a last-minute delay and will now arrive on August 22.
Developer Mega Cat Studios and publisher Skybound Games announced the delay yesterday evening, explaining the cause was due to the discovery of a save glitch. The statement reads,
“When performing final checks on one of our launch platforms, we discovered it was possible for players to lose their save game progress when playing WrestleQuest on multiple different devices. Because this is a game filled with hours of content and player progress is so important, we could never bodyslam our fans like that.”
While it’s a bummer to see the game get pushed back mere hours before launch, it’s a good thing the team caught this issue before it could affect players. Curious wrestling and RPG fans will have to wait another couple of weeks, but at least they'll presumably be able to play with some peace of mind. 
WrestleQuest unfolds in a world molded after action figure wrestling leagues with protagonist Randy “Muchacho Man” Santos on a quest to become the ultimate superstar. Inspired by classics like Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy VI, you’ll partner with a large cast of fellow grapplers to unleash special attacks and tag team moves on your opponents. In addition to fictional personalities, several real-life stars appear in the game, including Jeff Jarrett, Jake “The Snake” Roberts, Sgt. Slaughter, among others.
WresleQuest will be available on PlayStation and Xbox consoles, Switch, PC, and on mobile via Netflix.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Two of the most popular Pokémon arrive in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet's Paldea region through limited-time events. Best of all, you can add one of the most coveted Pokémon from Gen I, Mew, to your party for free right now. Then, you can gear up to challenge the powerful Mewtwo during the aptly named Get Mew And Mewtwo event.
Beginning now, you can receive Mew as a Mystery Gift in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. To do this, simply go to the Mystery Gift in-game menu while connected to the internet and enter the password "GETYOURMEW" before September 18. Each Mew's Tera Type, nature, and moves will be different to reflect the Mythical Pokémon's flexible capabilities. You'll be able to add Mew to your party and continue your adventures around the Paldea region, but you can also participate in the second portion of this event.
The second phase of this event kicks off September 1, with Mewtwo appearing in special Tera Raid battles. If you're able to defeat Mewtwo in these Tera Raid battles, you'll be rewarded with the opportunity to catch a Mewtwo with the Mightiest Mark, meaning these will be seven-star Tera Raid battles. The Pokémon Company also teases that if you challenge Mewtwo with Mew, you can expect "something special."
Pokémon Scarlet and Violet will also play host to several other Tera Raid battle events during this time. Wave 1 runs from today until August 17, Wave 2 runs from August 18 until August 31, and then Mewtwo finally arrives from September 1 to September 17.


During the same Pokémon Presents livestream, we also learned a lot about the upcoming Pokémon Scarlet and Violet expansions. For more on Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, be sure to check out our review. If you're more about the nostalgic side of the Pokémon franchise, this Pokémon Presents had you covered there as well, as Nintendo Switch Online also added two '90s Pokémon spin-offs to its classic game catalog.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am but a stripling level 4 sorcerer in Baldur's Gate 3, still learning to distinguish my Magic Missiles from my Chromatic Orbs, my Cantrips from my Colour Sprays (or at least, restore my memories of these concepts from my long-ago Baldur's Gate 2 playthrough). I've just discovered the finer applications of Mage Hands, which are a great antidote to goblin archers - simply spawn one behind the offender, use it to hurl them from the cliff they're standing on, and chuck a nearby crate after them for good measure. Magical indeed! Or so I thought, before I read about the real spells that lurk at the top of the level-up ladder in the D&D player handbook. 
These feats of wizardry make Mage Handing seem about as otherworldly as setting an alarm clock. Take Wish, a ninth level conjuration that allows you to "alter the very foundations of reality in accord with your desires", up to and including generating pricey equipment from nothing and rewinding time. Or how about Prismatic Wall, which spawns an ephemeral barrier 90-feet long, made up of seven layers that inflict a different effect on any creature passing through, from poison to petrification? Spicy enough for you, goblin archers? Sadly, it doesn't sound like either of these spells is hidden away anywhere in Baldur's Gate 3, which caps progression at level 12. And it's far from certain that they'll be added in the shape of an expansion pack. There's a good reason for this: higher level D&D spells and abilities are so potent it's hard to include them without turning Baldur's Gate 3 characters into gods.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Baldur's Gate 3, out of early access last week, is an officially licensed D&D RPG of many hours of turn-based combat, as you bring together a rag-tag group of misfit heroes to save the world from a mysterious cult. And also every single one of those misfit heroes wants to get at you. In many cases with zero prompting from you whatsoever. It doesn't end with your team companions either; by my loose estimations, any character who is in upwards of three cutscenes comes with a 70% chance of propositioning you. There's one romance option that I experienced effectively as a jump scare, entering a cutscene to see a character suddenly and casually-not-casually shirtless. It never ends. In hindsight, picking from a selection of genitals in character creation was probably a clue.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The curious journey of Ironmace's medieval extraction sim Dark And Darker continues with the launch of an early access build. You won't find it in one of the usual places, however. As Kaan reported in April, Dark And Darker was pulled from Steam following accusations of copyright theft from publisher Nexon (Ironmace's founder Terence Park and a developer Ju-Hyun Choi are Nexon alumni who worked on a similar fantasy game, codenamed P3, in 2020-2021). With legal proceedings on-going, Ironmace have released this tense first-person dungeon crawler via their own Blacksmith launcher and third-party store Chaf Games. It's a bit more ceremonial than letting people torrent the test builds, at least.

There are mysterious husky whisperings - "he's not new", "never bury your enemies alive" - and you fly through a giant stone wolf's head. What does all this bode? I'm going to say "shooting".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Call of Duty Modern Warfare III will be released on November 10, and we got the briefest of teases in a new trailer today. Activision confirmed today’s reveal last week after the game leaked online.
The teaser doesn’t provide much to go on except the release date; platforms are unannounced, but we imagine it'll be on the usual suspects. Sledgehammer Games is taking the reins, making it the first Modern Warfare title not made by Infinity Ward (but it's still assisting, as all Call of Duty studios tend to). Sledgehammer's last entry was 2021’s Call of Duty: Vanguard, and it also developed WWII and Advanced Warfare. 


In the meantime, be sure to check out our Modern Warfare II review and read how that game and Warzone will continue to get content updates in the form of new celebrity operators such as Snoop Dogg and Nicki Minaj. You can also read about how Sony signed a deal with Microsoft to keep the franchise on PlayStation for the next decade as part of the ongoing Microsoft/Activision acquisition.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Almost exactly one year ago, SNK announced a new Fatal Fury game, the first in over 20 years, was in the works. During EVO this weekend, the company revealed the game’s title is Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves, alongside a new teaser trailer.
The video shows off some brief in-game footage of staples Terry Bogard and Rock Howard in action. Unfortunately, we don’t see much more than that, and SNK has only promised to share more information at a later date. 


The last Fatal Fury game was 1999’s Garou: Mark of the Wolves, so a new entry has been a long time coming for fans. Hopefully, it arrives sooner than later and is another big fighting game to anticipate during a relative boom period for the genre thanks to Street Fighter 6 and the upcoming Mortal Kombat 1 and Tekken 8.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Indie publisher Devolver Digital has announced a slew of delays for some of its more anticipated titles on the horizon. Framed through a humorous parody of a Nintendo Direct, Devolver released a "Devolver Delayed Showcase" to tell players all about the games they won't be playing in 2023. The showcase highlights five games in particular: The Plucky Squire, Skate Story, Anger Foot, Stick it to the Stickman, and Pepper Grinder.
"We have some exciting news about next year," one host says. "This year's delays," the other host follows up. "Some of our brightest upcoming titles are finding their way to 2024!"
The Plucky Squire, a game that bounces between 2D and 3D gameplay, is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC. Pixel-art platformer Pepper Grinder is currently slated to arrive on Switch and PC. Meanwhile, roguelite brawler Stick it to the Stickman, kickflipping sports-action game Skate Story, and foot-based first-person shooter Anger Foot are currently only listed for PC. 
You can see the full Devolver Delayed Showcase below.


Devolver Digital has had a solid 2023, with titles like Terra Nil receiving positive reviews, fan-favorite Bleak Sword DX making its way to Switch and PC, and new content for Cult of the Lamb, but today's delays are sure to disappoint some. However, by this point in time, many players recognize that it's better to delay a game than to launch it before it's ready, and with Gunbrella and The Talos Principle 2 still slated for 2023, the indie publisher still has seemingly a lot in store for fans before the calendar changes over to 2024.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[New graphics card generations are a typical driving force behind gaming laptop refreshes, but CPUs can floor that pedal with just as heavy a boot. The result is often something like this latest Asus ROG Strix Scar 17, which wields not just a top-spec Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 but also one of AMD’s newest and most number-crunchy processors, the Ryzen 9 7945HX. 
That’s a lot of newness, and even more of a specs list: 32 threads from the Ryzen, 16GB of VRAM, DLSS 3 support and so on. And yet, what’s most impressive about the Strix Scar 17 is not simply its immense power, but how balanced – sensible, even – the whole laptop feels like in use. A quality that seems almost impossible at first, given its clear status as a brashly high-end gaming notebook with all the RGB bells and aggressive styling whistles.

Given how well this controller is supported for PC gaming, thanks to the efforts of Valve and modders behind projects like DualSenseX, this makes it an awesome pickup - whether you're looking to play Baldur's Gate 3 in couch co-op or F1 23 with full adaptive trigger support.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlatinumGames co-founder, Bayonetta director and celebrated Twitter shoutyman Hideki Kamiya would like the "retro" game label to go out of fashion. His argument is that calling something "retro" is inherently condescending - each game has its own particular achievements and qualities that deserve to be understood in terms of more than just nostalgia cultivated by a novelty-driven industry. After all, Johnny 90s Developer didn't spend months knocking together a bespoke cover system or fancy artstyle so that you could badge it "quaint", "old school" and so on, 30 years later. Assuming you can still access the game at all.
"I don't like the word 'retro game'," Kamiya told VGC in a wide-ranging interview also notable for some chunky insights on onomatopoeia in Japanese manga and its US adaptations. "I'm obviously not a native English speaker so it might be something I'm interpreting from a Japanese perspective, but hearing the word 'retro' from a Japanese viewpoint, suggests more of a 'fad' brought back from a past era and reskinned for the current era."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Red Dead Redemption is one of the best games of the PlayStation 3/Xbox 360 era, and it hasn’t migrated from those platforms since it arrived in 2010. After 13 years, that finally changes with a surprise jump to PlayStation 4 and Switch.
Rockstar announced today that Double Eleven Studios is creating these ports, which include the zombie-themed Undead Nightmare expansion in one package. This also means that PlayStation 5 players can experience the game due to PS4 backwards compatibility. While it's unclear if these versions feature any kind of performance or graphical improvements, they do have additional language support for simplified and traditional Chinese, Korean, Polish, Brazilian Portuguese, Russian, and Latin American Spanish. 


Red Dead Redemption follows former outlaw John Marston on a quest to track down the remaining members of his old crew, the Van der Linde Gang, in order to save his family. Its prequel, Red Dead Redemption II, arrived in 2018. If you missed out on the original the first time around, you can pick up Red Dead Redemption digitally on PS4 and Switch on August 17 for $49.99.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following her announcement as the first all-new character to join the Street Fighter 6 roster by way of DLC, A.K.I. gave fans a taste of what to expect when she is added to the game this fall. During this weekend's Evo 2023 fighting game tournament, we received a host of new announcements, including new characters added to the roster of the upcoming Mortal Kombat 1 and even a surprise TMNT collaboration with Street Fighter 6. However, Capcom didn't stop there, as it gave us the first teaser trailer for its 20th playable character, A.K.I.
Described as "a manaical poison aficionado," A.K.I. certainly seems to fit right in with the long lineage of over-the-top and deranged characters within the Street Fighter universe. You can check out the surprisingly dark teaser trailer for A.K.I. below.


While we already knew A.K.I. was planned, the teaser comes hot on the heels of the release of Rashid, the first DLC character for Street Fighter 6. Rashid debuted in Street Fighter V, but joined the roster of Street Fighter 6 less than two weeks prior to this teaser. A.K.I. arrives in Street Fighter 6 this fall. Both characters – as well as the two remaining members of Year 1, Ed and Akuma – are included in the Deluxe Edition, Ultimate Edition, or Year 1 Character Pass. Rashid is also currently available for individual purchase for 350 Fighter Coins (approximately $7). Regardless of how you obtain Rashid, you also get his secondary outfit and two additional color options. It stands to reason that A.K.I. will follow a similar release method.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Street Fighter 6 is popular right now. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is also pretty hot at the moment, especially with a new animated film out in theaters. That’s probably why Capcom is bringing the latter into the former in a fun-looking collaboration.
Beginning tomorrow, August 8, TMNT-themed costumes, cosmetic items, and emotes will let players transform their Street Fighter 6 avatars into Leonardo, Donatello, Raphael, and Michelangelo. The event also includes TMNT stamps and titles, plus wallpapers for camera mode. Even the Battle Hub is getting in on the spirit by decking it out with Turtles banners, signs, and trailers. In the trailer below, it looks as silly as you would expect. 


Street FFighter6 had a big showing at EVO this past weekend, as a new fighter A.K.I. was also announced. For more on Street Fighter 6, check out our review.]]></summary>

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2023/08/07/reptile-ashrah-and-havik-confirmed-for-mortal-kombat-1"/>
        <updated>2023-08-07T14:12:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mortal Kombat 1’s roster continues to expand, and the latest trailer reveals a returning staple and two long-lost fighters from the series’ 2000s era: Reptile, Ashrah, and Havik.
The lengthy trailer provides a great look at the new looks and abilities of each character as well as their respective roles in the story. Reptile is back in his more human form but can still shapeshift into his natural, intimidating lizard body to devour opponents.  
Fans of 2004’s Mortal Kombat: Deception should be happy to see the returns of Ashrah and Havik. Each made their debut in that game, and neither has appeared in the series since Deception’s follow-up, Mortal Kombat: Armageddon in 2006. Ashrah sports a much different look and moveset but remains a demoness mostly cleansed of her inherent evil. Havik appears to retain his chaotic brand of body-contorting, limb-tearing offense. Sareena has also been confirmed as a new Kameo fighter to fan the flame of 2000s nostalgia. Check out the new trailer and a fresh batch of screenshots below. 


       

Mortal Kombat 1 launches on September 19 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC. Be sure to check out the previous roster reveal trailers for Geras, Smoke, and Rain.]]></summary>

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2023/08/07/deathbound-is-a-new-soulslike-with-a-unique-class-based-twist"/>
        <updated>2023-08-07T14:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Publisher Tate Multimedia and developer Trialforge Studio have released the debut trailer for Deathbound, its new Soulslike action RPG with a unique class-based twist coming to Steam next year. 
Set in a crumbling civilization where unnatural science clashes with fanatical faith, players take on the role of a warrior set on confronting the Church of Death. In this world – Ziêminal – there's no good and no evil; just monsters and enemies in your way. And if today's Deathbound trailer is anything to go on, they won't go down without a fight. 
Check out the Deathbound reveal trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see in the trailer above, players can freely switch between various heroes of different classes in a party at any time, and they'll need to do so to survive in specific situations. Trialforge Studio calls this a "Binding System, allowing players to absorb the essence of the fallen warriors found throughout the world." Using the collected essence, players can obtain new skills and abilities to transform their playstyle, or they can use it to form a party of heroes they can then switch between. 
Binding also unlocks Morphstrikes, which combines all of a party's power into a devastating blow. 

"The memories and identities of the fallen will be uncovered through Binding as well," a press release reads. "In addition to environment and items, essence will reveal the narrative behind the world of Ziêminal and its inhabitants. Though players must tread carefully when Binding, as not all heroes converge harmoniously. The conflicts caused by divergent essences absorbed will greatly impact the gameplay and narrative alike." 
Deathbound is due out sometime in 2024 on Steam.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Baldur's Gate 3 is the CRPG with a billion and one features, but there will always be players who want a billion and two and yes, I am among these insatiable souls. I cracked a fresh save over the weekend, having bid a sad goodbye to my early access Tiefling rogue, and I already know what I’d like from the game’s modding scene, or preferably, a forthcoming official update. No, it isn’t new races, or increased party sizes, or the removal of the weight limit (which you can get around by offloading spare loot to your Tardis-esque interdimensional campsite). What I’d like most is the ability to switch between characters during dialogue. You’ll trigger many of these conversations without warning as you explore the world, and I routinely bumble into chitchats the character I’m controlling isn’t quite prepped for.

The orders are yet to appear in public, but we're informed that the Premier League will be able to block pirate IPTV services during the 2023/2024 and 2024/2025 seasons. Interestingly, the Sky order seems to cover a much shorter period but does identify six pirate IPTV services by name.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As people of a certain age will know, the current, slow-moving death of Twitter is nothing we haven't seen before. Most of us who were knocking around the internet in the early 00s will have at least one online gravestone in the closet somewhere, whether it's a long abandoned LiveJournal or MySpace page, or an old internet forum that sadly doesn't exist anymore (RPS in peace). But for the citizens of Videoverse, an online community that's part and parcel of the soon to be defunct 1-bit video games console the Kinmoku Shark, this sense of an ending is something that many of them aren't equipped to deal with, least of all teenager Emmett, who's just discovered the fan page for his favourite video game, Feudal Fantasy. 
As he deals with the prospect of having to bid farewell to friends old and new, including the mysterious but talented fan artist Vivi, Videoverse taps into a potent and nostalgic melancholy. It's a love letter to the early internet at its rose-tinted best, and to the lost, formative spaces that brought so many like-minded individuals together and gave them a sense of purpose. Yes, there are trolls spoiling everyone's fun, and yes, there's a hint of something more nefarious going on underneath Videoverse's source code. But another Hypnospace Outlaw this is not. Rather, this is a proto-internet tale that's all about the friendships we form online, and the bonds that carry us forward when real-life relationships just don't cut it anymore.

Join us today on Twitch at 2:30 p.m. Central as we kick of the adventure, which will continue each week until we roll credits. We'll also have every episode available the next day on our Game Informer Shows YouTube Channel (or you can watch the videos in the above playlist or by clicking the links below). 
Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts was released for the Xbox 360 on November 11, 2008. The third (and, so far, final) entry in Rare's beloved platforming series centers on vehicle creation, where players collect and slap together hundreds of parts to assemble their own wacky contraptions to explore. The bevy of possible combinations and emphasis on player choice and creativity was largely unprecedented at the time, paving the way for future games such as the upcoming The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. However, this direction would divide fans due to how much it strays from the traditional Banjo formula. So where will I land on it? Let's find out.
Join me, Marcus Stewart, alongside Kyle Hilliard as we explore one of the Xbox 360's biggest hidden gems to see whether it holds up or falls apart like a poorly constructed doohickey.

While handheld titles, the poorly received Sonic the Hedgehog 4, and other games like Sonic Generations and Sonic Colors contained 2D gameplay, Sonic Mania felt like the true successor to the beloved titles that appeared on Genesis and Sega CD throughout the 1990s. A sequel felt all but inevitable, but when Sega and Sonic Mania mastermind Christian Whitehead decided to amicably go in creatively different directions (read the full story here), Sonic Team creative officer Takashi Iizuka still wanted to build on the success experienced with Sonic Mania.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Look, I could justify this month's Reality Bytes in any number of ways. I could say the VR launch cupboard is a little bare at the moment, with Steam's New Releases list offering up a lot of dour military shooters, dubious Early Access projects, and fantasy dismemberment porn. I could say that The Room VR: A Dark Matter has just received a PSVR2 release, so now seems an opportune moment to revisit this acclaimed spin-off puzzler. I could say that The Room VR is the only entry in the series RPS hasn't covered yet. But to be perfectly honest, I just fancied playing The Room VR. So there.


Oh all right, there was a slightly more specific reason why I wanted to revisit a game that came out just three days after Half-Life: Alyx. Upon its launch, there wasn't much else like The Room on VR devices, a dedicated puzzler with high production values that didn't feel the need to throw in a gun to shoot or a melon to chop. Now, there are bunch of fantastic VR brain-ticklers swimming in the pond, such as the time-travelling epic Wanderer, the perspective-bending A Fisherman's Tale series, and the ingenious automation extravaganza The Last Clockwinder.

It's partly the style. Some gorgeous rotoscoping gives its few characters a sense of constant motion that's unreal and very lifelike at once, and it's sometimes pushed further by having them decelerate to a blurred freeze frame when you stop walking. The backgrounds are static but interactable things shimmer a bit, like in old cartoons where you could always tell what was background and what was going to do something. More than that, though, it had me intrigued.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm not afraid to admit this, but it's become increasingly obvious over the last few days of playing Baldur's Gate 3 that my ability to create interesting custom characters is severely lacking compared to other members of the RPS Treehouse. Case in point, our Ed breezily announced yesterday in our team Slack that he was playing as a Dark Urge bard called, wait for it, Edders Sheeran like it was no big deal whatsoever. I'm not gonna lie, a tiny part of me died inside upon hearing this, simply because of its sheer (not a pun), unadultered brilliance. I mean, come on, it's so good it should actually be illegal. 
But it also confirmed to me a deep dark truth about myself that I think I knew deep down, but had kinda been pushing under my equally drab mental carpet for years and years. I'm quite boring at the end of the day, and am the type of person who, no matter the game, always creates basically the same identical person every single time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Somerville is bringing its mysterious alien invasion to PlayStation consoles on August 31. The game comes from Jumpship, a studio formed by former Playdead (Limbo, Inside) CEO Dino Patti.
It centers on a small family rocked by a sudden alien invasion of Earth, who must now survive by running and hiding. The game’s eerie atmosphere and lack of dialogue lend to the game’s enigmatic nature, and multiple endings offer various truths about the threat you face.


Somerville launched for Xbox and PC last November to generally warm reviews, though was noted for its rough technical performance, which has since been improved in post-launch updates. In a press release, Jumpship promises the PlayStation port will be the “best version of Somerville yet” and will feature DualSense haptic feedback.

I don't like squinting at brow density or sliding the juiciness of my lips down a scale, twisting and turning my character as if it really and truly matters when I drown them in chainmail anyway. But getting my fella right for Baldur's Gate 3 was of utmost importance, as they'd be my 100+ hour vessel for awful, awful decisions. And I've started off strong, having created an awful little guy.
Let me introduce you to Edders Sheeran, the bard. On the surface he seems like a cheerful sprite, ready to pat his little drum and have everyone do a nice little dance. Truthfully, he is a psychopath who suppresses the urge to kill, thanks to a malevolent background choice that most would leave for a second playthrough, so as he plays Shape Of You, he also imagines the Shape Of You Dead.

This is not something the game discourages. In fact, I would say that Larian's Dungeons-&-Dragons-but-digital game actively encourages it. Both Edders and Graham found out that you can die almost immediately upon finishing the tutorial and encountering a dying bit of ocotopus sashimi in a crashed ship; fail a roll involved in talking to this unfortunate mind flayer and that's it. Kaput, in about an hour. As Graham observed, the lesson that this teaches you is not "mind flayers are dangerous", because you have already learned this lesson on account of the opening cutscene being all about that. The lesson is "the DM is a prick, so savescum often".

Having been burned out of Destiny 2 and most live service games, we discovered Remnant 2 delivers all the benefits of blasting gangly creatures for skill points without all the live service baggage. What a refreshing thing.
Thing is, if two out of the three major bosses we've faced so far took us to court for cheesing them, we'd lose. And it brings us no greater pleasure, knowing we've carved powerful new weapons out of their remains. God, it feels good to be totally undeserving of any credit whatsoever.

But the update’s called Smokin’ Hot because it makes all the guys in the game, well, smokin’ hot - if you're into men with a Gears Of War workout routine, that is. Following the revamped female character models last year, developer Gamepires continue their early access tour with a refresh for every male character in the game which may or may not include a touch up for the Danny Trejo DLC skin. Take a look at the new beefcakes and beefy mutants below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It is once more that time of year when the searing heat drives us underground, to subsist on raw snacks, re-read The Book Of Phoenix, and play this year's Low-Intensity Strategy Game For When It's Actually Refreshingly Temperate And Rainy Out But We're Committed To The Bit Now.
Myriads Colon Renaissance is not quite the break from the 4X that I'd tried to get us, but it is a hybrid. You build up a city, explore and conquer new lands, unlock research and ultimately push everyone's faces in, but its other main pillar is tower defence, a genre I very rarely align with. Which is a good sign, right? Two good reasons not to choose it, but I am anyway.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[How does one make a sequel to a basically perfect game? 2007's physics-platformer-in-a-weird-science-facility Portal is a lodestar piece of game design from top to bottom. It's one of my favourite games, and I went into 2011's Portal 2 with many a reservation. But it's very good! And there are so many things I love about Portal 2 that it's quite hard to pick just one thing to write about.
I could do "the joy of Portal 2's retro science", where you fall through the floor into the old school Aperture Science labs and see the 60s-ish version of all the big buttons and testing chambers you were put through in the first Portal. I could do "the joy of the corrupted personality cores in Portal 2", a group of corrupted AI spheres including Rick The Adventure Sphere, which is largely just Nolan North making up his own action theme song. I could even do "the joy of potatoes in Portal 2". And then I realised that most of the things I like about Portal 2 also intersect with Stephen Merchant's character Wheatley, a weird little guy (in the most pejorative sense).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's always been quite a disconnect between Revenant's reputation and his abilities in Apex Legends. All the cinematics we get of this infamous, terrifying murder-bot show him single-mindedly pursuing his targets, scuttling along walls, and wiping out enemies at close range like a cybernetic John Wick. But once you get in-game, his toolkit has always been fairly underwhelming - with the exception of his Death Totem, which never seemed to sit well thematically with the character.
Season 18 of Apex looks to change all that. Revenant is finally getting the love he deserves with a new sinister-looking base skin and a full rework of all his abilities. And guys, I think they might have gone a bit too far making him scary again. I think he might be overpowered.

But I implore you to take a moment to remember the great Losiir, a Githyanki soldier who most of you will probably never meet. That's because he only shows up if you pick Lae'zel as your origin character, because who else would be there to do her fancy sword lunge from above if not a gender-swapped version of basically herself? But he's a good egg, Losiir, even if his run-time as an official Baldur's Gate companion is, err, somewhat short-lived.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Striking Distance Studios, the studio behind last year’s action horror title The Callisto Protocol, has suffered layoffs.
It’s been confirmed via IGN that 32 employees have been let go from the studio. These include production coordinator Sebastian Marlow, associate producer Nora Falcon, senior environment artist Matthew Smith, and VFX artist Matt Christopherson. 
A spokesperson for Krafton, Striking Distance’s parent company, gave the following statement to IGN: 
“Striking Distance Studios and Krafton have implemented strategic changes that realign the studio’s priorities to better position its current and future projects for success. Unfortunately, these changes have impacted 32 employees. Honoring the invaluable contributions of each departing team member with material support in the form of outplacement services and meaningful severance packages is our top priority during this difficult moment.”
Striking Distance was founded in 2019 by Dead Space co-creator Glen Schofield alongside industry veterans. The Callisto Protocol was its first title, released in December 2022. Set in a prison on Jupiter’s moon of Callisto in 2320, it follows an inmate’s escape following an alien outbreak. The game received a mixed reception from critics and players; we scored it a 6 out of 10 in our review. It was reported in January that The Callisto Protocol underperformed in sales compared to its reportedly massive budget. 
The Callisto Protocol’s story expansion, Final Transmission, was released on June 28.

No more collapsing back to the Steam library on startup, and no forcing the use of Proton Experimental – it should launch and work straight away. Valve have even upgraded Baldur’s Gate 3 from Playable to Verified for Steam Deck play, reflecting its newfound handheld-readiness.
This means you can safely ignore the first part of this article, where I whinge about software instability as if it’s the the most heinous atrocity humankind has ever inflicted on itself. All the stuff on general performance, settings, and battery life still applies.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the run-up to Baldur's Gate 3 leaving early access, developers Larian Studios have understandably put a lot of emphasis on the game's custom character creation, what with it being much more firmly ingrained in the world of Dungeons & Dragons and role-playing more generally than, say, their previous Divinity games. But before you jump into creating your favourite D&D build, do take a moment to watch the Introductions for each of its fixed origin characters, too. They're great fun, well-written and have some good jokes in them, but they also reveal some important details about your companions-to-be that you might not have gleaned otherwise. They're also very easy to miss if you're not careful.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The distance from the roof of the Counting House to the nearest building in Baldur’s Gate is vast, by design. The waterfront bank where the city’s great, good and gangster store their gold stands with its back to the sea, while a long and well-guarded bridge extends from its maw, like a money-hungry tongue. Legend says its top two floors are entirely without windows, the House an eyeless god to the citizens who reside on the hillside that slopes down toward the docks. So how was Gale, the wizard prodigy, able to bound from a faraway balcony to the brim of the bank, as if stepping lazily out onto his porch with a mug of coffee? Some say strange sorcery was afoot, but I’ve seen his character sheet, and so can be more specific.
Upon levelling up, Gale multiclassed as a sorcerer - an odd choice, but one that allowed him to unlock the ability to throw magic from a great range. Suddenly, while casting a teleport spell, this hybrid mage was able to reach across the wide moat of the Counting House and land safely on a high ledge. It’s one of many obscure class synergies via which, Larian imagines, you’ll be able to break their level design in unexpected and entertaining ways.

GLaDOS’ return, for instance, is a stretch of pure puzzling with just a dash of dread, while your first steps into the abandoned 1960s Aperture facility interrupt a fairly hopeless tone with an upbeat sense of discovery. For me, though, Portal 2 peaks late. So late that by the time it begins, your journey through the 'true' puzzle chambers are essentially over, leaving you as little more than a loose end in the big glowing eye of a former buddy. It’s Chapter 9: The Part Where He Kills You! Mmm, love that part.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Activision is teasing a Call of Duty: Modern Warfare-related reveal next week. 
This lighthearted tease, which you can see below, hints that the next Call of Duty is another Modern Warfare, even though 2022’s Call of Duty was Modern Warfare II. However, if you’ve been paying attention to the Call of Duty space, it’s no surprise that this year’s Call of Duty is Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III. It’s leaked in various ways already, including on special Monster energy drink packaging (thanks, CharlieIntel). 
Jokes on you, real key art here.

August 2, 2023
As you can see, the official Call of Duty Twitter account says, “We’ll share our artistic abilities and even more next week,” alongside fake key art poking fun at redacted Modern Warfare III information leaking ahead of its official reveal. This aligns with a recent Modern Warfare II Season 5 blog post, which announced that the next Call of Duty would be revealed in-game through a “special event.” 
It seems that reveal is happening next week, although when or how remains unclear. Interestingly, the reveal of a new Call of Duty releasing this year contrasts with reports from early last year stating Call of Duty would skip 2023. 
In the meantime, read how Lara Croft, Nicki Minaj, Snoop Dogg, and 21 Savage are coming to Modern Warfare II and Warzone, and then read Game Informer’s Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II review. Check out this story about how Sony signed a 10-year agreement with Microsoft to keep Call of Duty on PlayStation after that.

Blizzard had previously spoken about the upcoming 1.1.1 plaster update during a developer livestream, but the new patch notes detail everything we can expect, including crucial fixes, tweaks to mounts, and big buffs for the Sorcerer and Barbarian classes. The patch drops on August 8th.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve lost track of how many times I’ve recommended people play Return Of The Obra Dinn. It's the one game I'm confident recommending to anyone to folks who play games frequently, but also to those who don't. My biggest triumph was recommending it to my dad, a 62-year-old retired manufacturing manager from Wales, who loved it so much he not only recommended it to a friend (who also loved it) but also said my mum should try it too - and I agree! It’s all subjective of course, but for me, its banger of a story, accessible it is, and how you can practically run it on a potato make it a wonderful gateway into gaming in general.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo just had one of its best first quarters since the launch of the Switch in 2017, thanks in part to sales of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.
The company’s latest financial report reveals that Tears of the Kingdom sold 18.51 million units from its release to June 30. This led to Nintendo having the highest “global sell-through of first-party” for a first quarter since the launch of the Switch. It says sales of Tears of the Kingdom also drove hardware sales, as Nintendo sold 3.91 million units in this quarter, which ran from April 1 to June 30, 2023. 


Nintendo says those 3.91 million units sold translates to unit sales for the entire Switch family of systems rising by 13.9% year-on-year, led primarily by the Switch OLED Model, which contributed 2.83 million of those sales…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Return Of The Obra Dinn is, quite rightly, one of the greatest video games of all time. It's certainly one of my personal favourites, and as this year's RPS 100 has proven, it's also greatly beloved by the rest of the RPS Treehouse. A brilliantly conceived murder mystery puzzle box (boat?) that not only has you working out whodunnit, but howdunnit, Obra Dinn is one of those detective games that really thrusts you into the thick of its deduction process. As you set about working out the identities and causes of death for each of the 60 souls onboard, it places you firmly in front of the ship's wheel before giving you free rein to steer its hull of supernatural horrors into whatever port of judgment you deem fit. 
There are no truly wrong answers in Obra Dinn, but due to the nature of how you go about solving it, it's also one of those games I can't play too often without feeling like I know all the answers already. It's only now, five years later, that I feel like I could probably go back to Lucas Pope's nautical masterpiece and marvel at it afresh on a second playthrough, but there's one particular set of crew unmaskings that even its time-travelling stopwatch can't erase from my memory banks. Spoilers to follow obviously, but if you know, you know. I'm talking about the shoe and hammock revelation.

Life sims can be great stress relievers by letting you build a digital life from the ground up at a leisurely pace. However, many of those titles offer freeform experiences where more purpose-driven players may struggle with having to make their own fun. Palia aims to satisfy both crowds by tossing dozens of players into a fleshed-out fantasy world to build a life while also embarking on an epic quest. I made a new life for myself within developer Singularity 6’s upcoming free-to-play life sim MMO. While much of it feels familiar, the promise of building a home alongside friends while unraveling a central mystery is enticing for the genre.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["We don't go to Ravenholm…" Half-Life 2's sixth chapter heading warns, and when you arrive at the outskirts of this abandoned mining town, you immediately see why. This headcrab and zombie-infested cess pit is an absolute horror show right from the off. Moans and screeches assault your ears from every nook and cranny of this dark murder hole, and if the hoarse crow calls and suspiciously high number of propane barrels weren't enough to put you off, the bloodied torsos lodged against its log cabin walls by deep set saw blades certainly will. Every fibre of your being is telling you to get the hell out of this place, and that surely, the Combine forces chasing you down here can't be worse than what's in front of you. 
But I'd also add an addendum to that heading that goes something like this: "We don't go to Ravenholm, and definitely not with just a gravity gun." This is a place that demands you to have as much firepower as you can possibly muster, such are the monstrosities that lie in wait here. But what did baby Katharine decide to do when she was playing it alone on her terrible university laptop in the dead of night back in 2010? She decided to have a go at that old Zombie Chopper achievement for no good reason whatsoever. And what followed was even more horrifying than Ravenholm had any right to be.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Baldur’s Gate 3 is right around the corner - comes out tomorrow, August 3rd - and everything we’ve learned about the mammoth RPG makes it sounds like an awfully horny romp. Of course, there’s the recently revealed hot villainess that had an entire corner of the internet making the same joke: “I can fix her.” There’s the fact that you can seduce a druid who’s in bear form - as in an actual bear, not the gay slang version of the word. And now, the voice actor behind Baldur’s Gate 3’s narrator has posted several outtakes, giving us gems such as “I’m a bard, I can fuck my way through any problem.” Have a listen here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Lords of the Rings: Gollum launched in May with myriad issues, making it tough to play through at various points throughout the action-adventure game. Head here to read Game Informer's Gollum review. However, developer Daedalic Entertainment is targeting many of those problems in the game’s PC version with a new patch that’s now live. 
Daedalic published an extensive list of changes for the PC version on the Gollum Steam page. It’s unclear if any of these changes are coming to the game’s console versions, but Game Informer reached out to Daedalic to ask and will update this story if it hears back. As for the PC patch, it includes changes that fix issues with quest markers disappearing, interactable objects becoming non-interactable, checkpoint system bugs, and much more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I don't know about you, but I've been immensely enjoying the seeming renaissance of tower defence citybuilding games recently. The grimdark horrors of Age Of Darkness: Final Stand might be a bit too hard as nails for my personal liking, but there's something about the act of building up my little settlements and defending them against ever-larger nightly hordes that just unlocks something in my brain that says, 'Yes, more of this, please'. It's the same feeling I got from the blocky delights of Diplomacy Is Not An Option and the deckbuilding, comic-book stylings of ORX, too, but now there's a new kid that's ridden into town who I think might be the king of the lot. 
Thronefall is a more minimalist take on the citybuilder tower defender, but while its bright colours might look like the distant cousin of a Townscaper toybox (it is, after all, made by the same dev wot did the equally charming Islanders), this deadly little thing is absolutely genius. It's only just come out in early access today, but I've been having a great time with a pre-release build of it, and can feel it sinking its claws into me with every attempt at its final level.

Casting you as a refugee adventurer, you’ll be shooting and/or spell-flinging across the war-ravaged world of Jäan, and you can even bring a friend along for the ride in co-op. We already knew all that good stuff, but the developers have now released a new video that delves deeper into the game’s classes and specialisations. Take a look below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Civil Protection officers are shorter than I thought they’d be. Don’t get me wrong, I'm very much a Short King myself, but I assumed the gas mask-wearing enforcers of City 17 would be more vertically intimidating. As I defiantly refuse to pick up litter in Half-Life 2’s opening sequence, I find the approaching officer and his raised electric baton to be weirdly adorable. Until he hits me, of course. The resulting crack gives me such a fright that I fling my arms out and smack my hand against the corner of a bookcase.
This has been my experience of playing the first few hours of Half-Life 2’s excellent fan-made VR mod, a completely free add-on that transforms Valve’s 2004 masterpiece into a full virtual reality experience. Under my direct control, Gordon Freeman is less a time-displaced MIT graduate with a penchant for murder and instead a gawking tourist who’s more interested in staring at canal architecture than liberating humanity. I spend the majority of my time leaning in really close to walls and muttering, “That’s interesting,” before a leaping headcrab shocks me so severely that I damage some more furniture and scare the cat.

        <updated>2023-08-02T12:38:29.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Electronic Arts CEO Andrew Wilson has revealed that the publisher is working on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One ports of Star Wars Jedi: Survivor.
He did so during EA’s company Q1 earnings call yesterday, as reported by The Verge. Survivor launched on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC earlier this year, in April, and received critical acclaim – Game Informer gave it a 9.25, making it a must-play game. But it skipped the PS4 and Xbox One generation that its predecessor, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, launched on. 


“Thanks to the strength of this legendary franchise and community demand, our development team has committed to bringing this Jedi experience to PlayStation 4 and Xbox One,” Wilson said during the call, according to The Verge. 
Fallen Order launched on PS4 and Xbox One with some technical difficulties, and while Survivor wasn’t perfect on that front, it performed a lot better on the now current-gen hardware. It will be interesting to see how it performs on the previous-gen hardware that Fallen Order had difficulties with. As for when to expect this Survivor port, it sounds like it could be a while because IGN reports that Wilson said the port is “in the early stages of development.” 
While waiting for it to hit PS4 and Xbox One one day, read Game Informer’s Star Wars Jedi: Survivor review and then read about how the game’s director wants the series to be a trilogy. Watch our video interview with Cal Kestis actor Cameron Monaghan about the sequel after that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you own Half-Life 2 but never bothered with its freebie tech demo, Half-Life 2: Lost Coast, do give it a whirl. Its showcase of HDR lighting might have lost the "Huh, nice" factor it had in 2005, but it’s still a satisfying slice of punchy HL2 combat, with a nod to the original Half-Life that Valve regretted not making in the main game. I know this because Valve told me, via Lost Coast's other innovation: its developer commentary.
I love these things, these spinning speech bubbles inflated with knowledge straight from the FPS coalface. So do Valve, judging by how dev commentary has appeared (in identical, node-activatable form) in most of their games since. They’re interesting and illuminating, don’t interfere with the game unless the player wants them to, and help build design literacy. Why, then, don’t more games offer commentary as well?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I was a kid growing up in rural New Mexico, I dreaded the first day of school. I had to give up whole days of biking in the desert with my brother and playing video games, sure, but the real problem was school supplies. My poor mom had to track down a huge list of supplies the school said we needed, from pencils and paper to expensive binders and calculators. Sure, back to school sales took the sting out of these mandatory purchases, but it was often a real stretch to get everything I needed, and I'd need to make friends quickly to borrow anything I didn't manage to come to school with. 
That's why I was particularly amused, a decade and a bit later, to find out that Ebay is offering 20% off back to school purchases in the US, and that category of products includes a $999 LG OLED gaming monitor. Even for a university student, that's one heck of an upgrade for the new school year - but a darn good deal if you're considering this kind of ultra-premium gaming monitor.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ugreen is a Chinese brand that has made a name for itself by providing surprisingly good design and build quality with the same aggressive pricing as its domestic competitors. I've used one of their USB-C chargers before, but I wish I'd bought this 4-port Gallium Nitride (GaN) charger that offers three USB-C ports, one USB-A port and a maximum output of 100W - sufficient for many lighter laptops, but more importantly the Steam Deck, mobile phones, tablets, headphones and controllers. This normally costs £50, but today it's down to £42 to Scan in the UK.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have an affection for '90s first-person shooter Sin I suspect the game doesn't deserve, because it had a handful of good guns, ATMs you could press the buttons on, and a fight on the rooftop of a train. I am therefore always interested in each seemingly cursed attempt to revive the series.

The latest is Sin: Reloaded, from frequent remaster crew Night Dive Studios. Announced back in 2020 without an update since, Night Dive now say that the project "isn't dead" but will be tackled "at a later date."

The Steam blog says that early access saves and profiles "aren't compatible with the release version... and leaving them in your save folders may in some fringe cases cause issues."

Original Story: Baldur's Gate 3 is mere days away, and you may be wondering if you can prep in some way for the epic RPG's release. You can, it turns out: not by pre-loading its 122GB download size on Steam, no, but by deleting your Early Access saves and uninstalling the game entirely.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft has revealed Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope: Rayman in the Phantom Show, the final announced DLC coming to the Nintendo mashup strategy game that hit Switch last October. 
Shortly after the release of Sparks of Hope last year, Ubisoft announced it had three DLCs planned for the game. The first was The Tower of Doooom, which hit the game this March. Ubisoft released the second DLC, The Last Spark Hunter, last month and now, we know when DLC 3 completes the game’s post-launch roadmap because Rayman in the Phantom Show goes live on August 30. 
You can check out the Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope DLC 3: Rayman in the Phantom Show reveal trailer for yourself below: 


“Rayman is back,” the trailer’s description reads. “And he is the special guest in a new mysterious dimension: the Phantom Opera’s network studio. The Phantom, the charismatic ghostly boss of Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle, is also coming back and asking for help to improve his channel’s ratings.” 
When Ubisoft revealed its post-launch content roadmap for Sparks of Hope last year, it said Rayman would be featured in DLC 3 and now, almost a year later, he’s finally here. 
Sparks of Hope’s Rayman in the Phantom Show DLC hits the game on August 30. 
While waiting for this DLC to go live, read Game Informer’s Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope review. For more Mario, check out the reveal trailer for Super Mario Bros. Wonder and then watch the Super Mario RPG remake trailer afterward.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mountaintop Studios has released the first teaser for its in-development competitive shooter inspired by anime, manga, and comics. 
Mountaintop Studios is a relatively new studio formed in 2020 by Nate Mitchell, a co-founder of Oculus. Mitchell enlisted several others to the studio for its leadership with experience at Double Fine, Valve, Naughty Dog, Riot Games, and Blizzard Entertainment. Now, the studio has more than four dozen employees and is hard at work developing a shooter it hopes has 10,000 hours of depth and fosters incredible communities and lasting friendships. 
While its first game remains unannounced technically, Mountaintop tweeted a short teaser today with the caption, “Soon.” Hopefully, we will get more information about the game soon because this teaser looks interesting. Check it out for yourself below:

August 1, 2023
As you can see, the video teases some of the characters and locales of the game, all of which look pretty comic book-y, with a very stylized aesthetic. The symbols at the end might hint at different factions in the game, and the teaser seems to quickly highlight a few maps players will be shooting each other on. 
“For the last three years, we’ve been hard at work on our first project, a competitive shooter for those that love the genre,” a hiring post from last month reads on the studio’s website. “As we shift into production, we’re looking for more talented individuals to join our time of fully-remote veterans.
"The game is set in a brand new universe, inspired by our favorite comics, anime, and manga. It’s a world where players can build a legacy through teamwork and competition.” 

We’ll watch for more information on Mountaintop’s first game and update you on Game Informer.

The Xbox maker announced the controller in a blog post, revealing that the controller is available for preorder starting today.

The controller is onyx blue, with a smoky aesthetic that gives the controller a unique look in the lineup of Xbox Series X/S controllers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jujutsu Kaisen is the latest anime to crossover with Epic Games’ free-to-play battle royale, Fortnite. 
The official Fortnite Twitter account officially announced this crossover today with a quick teaser video showcasing some original characters making shadow puppets on a wall in the battle island’s Mega City locale. Shortly after, Jujutsu Kaisen’s Gojo, Megumi, Nobara, and Yuhi crash through that wall, revealing the first look at these skins in-game. 
You can check out the Jujutsu Kaisen Fortnite skins for yourself in the teaser below:


Fortnite’s anime crossovers began with Naruto in 2021, followed by Dragon Ball Z and My Hero Academia last year. While some players have criticized the visuals of some of the earlier anime characters added to Fortnite (looking at you, Goku and Vegeta), Epic Games’ creations have only become better over the years. It brought Attack On Titan characters to Fortnite this year, and those skins looked great, and these Jujutsu Kaisen skins also look good. 
As for when to expect Gojo, Megumi, Nobara, and Yuji, the Fortnite Twitter account says they hit the game alongside the release of Update 25.30, which goes live next week on August 8. 
Fortnite is no stranger to crossovers. The current season brought Transformers’ Optimus Prime to the game, and back in May, Miles Morales and Miguel O’Hara’s Spider-Men iterations hit the battle royale. That same month saw Star Wars' Anakin, Padme, Darth Maul, and more join Fortnite. And before that, Adonis Creed entered the ring shortly after Dragon Ball Super’s Piccolo and Gohan.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Citizen Sleeper is a game with lots of brilliant individual stories in it, even the ones that end so catastrophically badly that redemption seems nigh on impossible. But when I look back on this tabletop-infused RPG and think of my favourites, there is one that stands head and shoulders above the rest. It isn't one of Citizen Sleeper's more emotional story beats (I miss ya, Lem and Mina), nor is it its most thrilling (big love to my man Feng). Rather, it's one of the game's quietest and arguably least significant plot points, but the fact it's there at all is probably what cemented Citizen Sleeper as one of my favourite games of last year. It is, of course, befriending The Stray who takes up residence in your Lowend apartment.

        <id>120886</id>
        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2023/07/31/nintendos-next-console-will-reportedly-be-portable-like-switch-targeting-second"/>
        <updated>2023-07-31T14:17:03.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo’s next console will reportedly be portable like the Switch and is targeting a release in the second half of 2024, according to a new report today from VideoGamesChronicle. 
VGC cites “multiple people with knowledge of Nintendo’s next-gen console plans” that reveal Nintendo’s Switch successor is aiming for a release in the second half of next year, to ensure there’s plenty of stock at launch. Nintendo wants to avoid the stock shortages that plagued the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S release for months (and years for some). 


The publication reports that two of its sources suggest the next-generation console will use LCD screens, like those seen on the launch versions of the Switch, rather than the OLED screens used in the Switch OLED models. The use of LCD reduces costs, VGC writes, in light of the likely need for significantly more storage than what’s in the Switch, which will increase costs. 
VGC’s sources also suggest Nintendo’s next console will be playable on the go, similar to the Switch’s console-handheld hybrid nature. Its sources also say the console will continue using physical cartridges like the Switch, although it’s unclear if this console will be backwards compatible with the Switch.
In February of last year, Nintendo said the Switch was in the middle of its lifecycle, meaning that while a new Nintendo console might launch next year, the company might not necessarily abandon the Switch any time soon. However, if Nintendo continues support of the Switch alongside a next-gen console, it’s unclear how that will work as, presumably, this new console will be a good bit more powerful than the Switch. 
Regardless of how Nintendo approaches Switch support following the release of a new console and backwards compatibility, the Super Mario Bros. maker likely wants to convert the Switch’s massive install base into its following product.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[NetherRealm Studios has released a new Mortal Kombat 1 trailer focused on the Keepers of Time and Geras, a Mortal Kombat 11 debut character returning as a playable fighter. 
The Mortal Kombat studio has released a steady flow of trailers and gameplay since its MK1 reveal back in May, and that continued over the weekend with a new showcase on the Keepers of Time faction and sand-wielding warrior Geras. In it, we get new looks at Liu Kang, including a new fatality for him, and Geras. 
You can check out the MK1 Keepers of Time trailer for yourself below: 


Over the weekend, MK1 director Ed Boon tweeted an image with what many think might be a new character debuting in the game. Boon writes, “New phone. Who dis?” and circles the unknown character, leading many to believe it’s a tease of a new fighter.

Since the launch of the PS5, audiophiles have asked for Dolby Atmos audio support on the console. Without diving too deep into the nitty gritty, Dolby Atmos is one of the best audio formats when adequately supported. While the PS5’s 3D Tempest audio tech is impressive, players have also wished for Dolby Atmos support. And now, with the latest system software beta, it has arrived. 


“3D Audio powered by Tempest 3D AudioTech can now be enjoyed by those who own compatible Dolby Atmos-enabled HDMI devices such as soundbars, TVs, or home theater systems,” a PlayStation Blog pos…]]></summary>

As an omnipresent robotic voice condescendingly wishes my team luck, my eyes widen in disbelief as a massive portal materializes over a city block. It spews hundreds of raptors that rain from the sky, tumbling down buildings before they sprint in our direction. It’s a jaw-dropping sight, but that awe turns to intimidation at the staggering number of adversaries thirsty for our blood. Our tank units move forward and activate their shields to create a defensive wall. A healer fills health bars to the brim. A sniper tak…]]></summary>

Square Enix revealed this 7.0 expansion that acts as a new beginning for Final Fantasy XIV with a new cinematic trailer. After the trailer, director Naoki Yoshida took to the main stage to host a keynote presentation, and it was during this that we learned a lot about the Dawntrail expansion, which will hit the game sometime in summer 2024. Let's break it all down.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Final Fantasy XIV is finally coming to Xbox Series X/S next spring. 
Xbox head Phil Spencer joined Final Fantasy XIV director Naoki Yoshida on stage today, during Day 1 of Final Fantasy XIV Fan Festival 2023, to reveal the news.
Here's what Spencer had to say:
Spencer says this is a seminal moment "in our relationship with you and the Final Fantasy team as we look to partner more closely together in the future," perhaps teasing more Final Fantasy to come to Xbox down the line. 
While the game will be playable on both Xbox Series X and Series S, Yoshida says only the Series X version will support 4K resolution. The Xbox version of Final Fantasy XIV is expected sometime during the spring of 2024. Before the release of 7.0 and during Patch 6.5X, there will be an open beta scheduled for the Xbox version. 
This means the Dawntrail expansion will be playable on Xbox Series X/S at launch. Like with other platforms, Final Fantasy XIV will only be available as a digital release on Xbox. You can go straight from the Open Beta to the full version, too, as saved data and progress transfer over. 
For more about Final Fantasy XIV, watch the reveal trailer for Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail and then read Game Informer's Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker review.

Sonic Superstars aims to give players an experience loyal to those initial Classic Sonic entries on the Genesis. However, unlike past games like Sonic Generations and Sonic Mania, which relied heavily on fan-favorite zones from previous games, Sonic Superstars forges its own path within the Classic Sonic series, delivering all-new stages that still deliver that Classic Sonic feel.
"Well-known stages like Green Hill have made return appearances in many games, but that’s because it was necessary from a story point of view," Sonic Team creative officer Takashi Iizuka says. "This t…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Final Fantasy XIV publisher Square Enix and developer Creative Business Unit III have revealed Dawntrail, the MMO’s next expansion, and it hits the game next summer. 
Square Enix revealed Dawtrail today, the first day of Final Fantasy XIV Fan Festival 2023 in Las Vegas, with a new trailer showcasing the tropical New World known as Yok Tural and many beloved characters hanging out there. Shortly after the reveal, director Naoki Yoshida took the stage to discuss the expansion as part of the Fan Festival’s keynote presentation. 
Check out the Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail expansion trailer for yourself below: 


Yoshida says the logo art for Dawntrail was created by Yoshitaka Amano using the color gold, which is the theme color of this expansion. You can check out the Dawntrail logo below:
 














	


  
    

  
      
            


      
  










Speaking to the story, Yoshida says, “We want to bring the very best summer vacation a hero could possibly have” to the Warriors of Light (the players). Without spoiling the events of 2021’s Endwalker expansion, Yoshida says Dawntrail is a significant shift from the previous expansion. Where Endwalker was dark, with the end of the universe on the line, Dawntrail is brighter and seemingly lighter in tone. 
“It’s a new beginning of Final Fantasy XIV [and] the theme is a journey of discovery. As you know, the arc we’ve been on from 1.0 to Endwalker about Hydaelyn and Zodiark has concluded. So you can think of this as our first step into a new story for Final Fantasy XIV.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Adibou, the first game in the beloved children's series, is now ready for public testing!
Also known as Adi Jr.'s World of Discoveries, this 1991 Coktel Vision title began the educational Adibou collection aimed at children of age 4 to 7 years.
Many of the iconic activities and mechanisms of the series were already part of this first opus: planting flowers, playing the game Breakout, and being rewarded with sweets upon completing Read/Count exercises. And of course, this was Adibou's first appearance! Although the floppy release has him speak the same strange gibberish as heard in the Goblins series, he is still the patient and funny learning partner that he's remembered for being in later games.
ScummVM supports all of the game's releases, from the initial 16-color floppy ones to later 1994 CD versions with richer graphics and sound effects. So dig out your dusty Adibou disks, get a ScummVM daily development build, and start collecting sweets while completing math and reading exercises! Please also contact us if you own a version ScummVM is not yet aware of, and report to the issue tracker any problem you may encounter.
As much as ScummVM aims to replicate the original gaming experience, there is one feature we are unfortunately unable to support. When hardworking children complete their virtual sweets collection, a message invites them to mail a floppy disk with their savegame to Coktel Vision, who would send them a parcel containing Coktel goodies and actual sweets! So if you are introducing children to Adibou through ScummVM, be prepared to go to the nearest shop and buy some candy for when they finish the game!
