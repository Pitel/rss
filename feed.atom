Publisher Sega, in association with developer Relic Entertainment, has announced that wartime strategy sequel Company of Heroes 3 will be making its debut on PS5 and Xbox Series X on May 30, following on from its initial PC release in February of this year.
This will be the first time that the lauded strategy series will be made available on console platforms, with Relic promising a fully optimized experience for PlayStation and Xbox players. Company of Heroes 3 will feature a fully overhauled U.I. and control system designed especially for the console platforms, with in-game features such as Full Tactical Pause allowing players to masterfully control their troops in the thick of the action, unperturbed by the lack of mouse & keyboard control systems.

Set against the backdrop of the North African campaign of World War II, Company of Heroes 3 offers up new solo and multiplayer game modes, as well as the new, sandbox-style, Italian campaign. Unfortunately, reviews were incredibly divisive for the ambitious new release, and while many praised the sequel's new control features and highly impressive destruction physics, some critics complained that the title didn't do enough to recreate the intensity of battle, with weak A.I. opposition and a casual approach to moment-to-moment warfare.
Fortunately, the community has been utilizing the feedback forum to discuss the title's issues with developers. So, hopefully, there will be time and opportunity to polish the game's rougher edges.
Company of Heroes 3 launches on PS5 and Xbox Series X May 30. It is available right now on PC.

Solo-developer Wegenbartho-Games has launched a Kickstarter for their murder mystery adventure, The Murder Hotel. The campaign runs until May 3, 2023 and is seeking €8,500.
This is kind of hilarious. The Murder Hotel is a murder mystery, but rather than figure out the murderer, I guess you already know: It’s some scissor-wielding demon. The demon won’t let you leave unless you pin their murders on the various guests. Like, they didn’t actually do it, but you have to come up with a super-plausible theory that “proves” that they did. So, you’re just deliberately accusing innocent people.
[caption id="attachment_373827" align="alignnone" width="640"] Image via Wegenbartho-Games[/caption]
You need to convince a demon council, so maybe there won’t be any real repercussions for these people you accuse. I choose to believe they’re just going to be sucked down into Hell. I’m feeling really malicious, so I want to just creatively screw some digital people over.
Beyond the concept being delectable, the campaign is pretty informative on where the project is and what planning has been done. It’s enough information to build confidence and outline all the plans.
The downside is that the plan is for The Murder Hotel to launch in December 2024. That’s a reasonable development period, but I want it now. There are stretch goals for more languages and another to have actual voice-over. I hate when people talk to me, so that’s not a must-have feature for me.
The Murder Hotel is slated for release on Switch and PC. The Kickstarter campaign runs until May 3, 2023 and is projected to release in December 2024.

Typhlosion is here in Pokemon Scarlet & Violet, and with it comes a corresponding 7-Star raid. Anyone who defeats Typhlosion will be able to catch it, so we caught it as we always do. Check out all its stats, abilities, and moves below.
If you need help unlocking this encounter, check out our guide here.
[gallery size="large" columns="2" ids="373732,373733"]
Pokemon Scarlet & Violet Typhlosion loot list
Here’s everything I earned during my first clear of this battle. As a reminder, you can only catch Typhlosion once while the event is live. However, you can run the battle continuously for rewards.
Exp.Candy L x6
Exp.Candy XL x4
Calcium x5
Ghost Tera Shard x20
Ghost Tera Shard x10
TM114
Ability Patch X1
Star Piece x2
Exp.Candy L x6
Bottle Cap x1
Calcium x5
PP Up x1
Exp. Candy L x5
Mild Mint
Look at those Ghost Tera Shards, maybe I'll use them on Annihilape! TM114 (Shadow Ball) and the Ability Patch are only guaranteed to drop once, though more Ability Patches may appear if you continue to farm this encounter.
[gallery columns="4" ids="373734,373735,373736,373737"]
Pokemon Scarlet & Violet Samurott moves and stats
Typhlosion sports the Ghost Tera Type, making it similar to Hisuian Typhlosion from Pokemon Legends: Arceus. Like past events, it is level 100 and has its hidden ability Flash Fire. Here are its moves:
Eruption
Shadow Ball
Play Rough
Earthquake
Here are Samurott’s stats:
HP – 297
Attack - 204
Defense – 172
Sp. Atk – 279
Sp. Def – 206
Speed – 236
Also like past 7-Star encounters, Typhlosion will have the Mightiest Mark. This grants it the title of Typhlosion the Unrivaled.
Does the Pokemon Scarlet & Violet Typhlosion count as a Paldean Pokedex entry?
Nope! The Pokedex will stay at a maximum of 400, regardless of how many event monsters you catch. This may change down the line, but for now, Typhlosion doesn’t affect your Pokedex completion.

Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts was released for the Xbox 360 on November 11, 2008. The third (and, so far, final) entry in Rare's beloved platforming series centers on vehicle creation, where players collect and slap together hundreds of parts to assemble their own wacky contraptions to explore. The bevy of possible combinations and emphasis on player choice and creativity was largely unprecedented at the time, paving the way for future games such as the upcoming The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. However, this direction would divide fans due to how much it strays from the traditional Banjo formula. So where will I land on it? Let's find out.
Join me, Marcus Stewart, alongside Kyle Hilliard as we explore one of the Xbox 360's biggest hidden gems to see whether it holds up or falls apart like a poorly constructed doohickey.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Remedy Entertainment has revealed a new company logo, and fans of the letter R are sure to be pleased as punch.
It’s been 20 years since Remedy updated its logo, but above is the image that will appear on the studio’s projects going forward. That includes Alan Wake II, a yet-to-be-revealed Control sequel, a Control multiplayer title, and remakes of Max Payne 1 and 2. The previous logo was pretty much just the letter R too, but this one has a different font and kind of hurts our eyes looking at it. 
In a blog post, Remedy gives its simple rationale for the update: 
“The bullet in the letter R in the old logo represented the era of Max Payne, but the Remedy of now is much bigger than a single game; we have a whole portfolio of games, new and old.  
It was time to update and redefine our visual identity to bring more consistency, showcase our evolution over the years, and better express our vision of today’s Remedy.”
So there you have it. What do you think of Remedy’s new logo? Let us know in the comments.]]></summary>

It was already interesting and good enough pretty much right away to earn a recommendation, but after one of what will definitely be several playthroughs, leaving my praise that faint would do it a terrible injustice.


Loretta is goddamn excellent by any standard. Where other games use the mentally unwell narrator to explain everything away with "turns out you're secretly crazy", it's instead just one layer of a complex horror mystery with splashes of drama and noir, whose surprises I'm straining not to spoil.

We're roughly one month out from the launch of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, and another Nintendo property is joining the festivities. Splatoon 3 will host a Zelda-themed Splatfest on the weekend before Tears of the Kingdom's launch.
Running from May 5 to May 7, this special Splatfest will split players up amongst the three sections of the Triforce: Wisdom, Power, and Courage. Pick your favorite aspect of the Triforce, or maybe just your favorite holder to back, and join in the inky battles.
The Splatfest will also host fights on a special version of Scorch Gorge, with a Triforce-style layout. This map seems pretty well-suited to Tricolor Turf Wars in particular, which seems like it could make that mode fairly appealing for the weekend.

Get your Splatoon x Zelda virtual look too
It's not just about the battles, though. As any Splatoon player will tell you, it's as much about the fashion. And this special three-way Splatfest will also have residents of the Splatlands dressing up in themed shirts for the showdown, too.
Themed shirts are also hitting the Nintendo store, for real-life wear. So if you're a fan of both Splatoon and Zelda, and wanted to express that in everyday life, you've got an easy medium for it now. There's also a sale available for a bundle with Splatoon 3 and a three-month Nintendo Switch membership, running from April 17 through May 7.
Nintendo hosted a launch-window Splatfest for Pokemon Scarlet and Violet as well, and it's nice to see them keeping the trend up. It's a fun way to celebrate a new game launch, and all the added theming and cosmetics are a neat touch. So yes, I think I'll be booting Splatoon back up for a few matches, just to lock in my Power vote and shirt.

Although the game still could use some cleaning up, Game Freak is doing a decent job of keeping Pokemon Scarlet & Violet events and promos running: even if most of the latter are fairly small time. Well, there's
Spotted by Japanese Pokemon players via Pokemon Company emails (including this tweet from Twitter user ShxQ183ag88QPe6, who screenshotted the email), these new codes dole out items for the game, and can be redeemed once per save file.
New Mystery Gift codes have rolled out in April
Here's a list of all the codes and when they expire:
LEVEL UP (10 Rare Candies, expires on October 2, 2023)
CATCHBYBALL (Five balls of multiple varieties [Luxury, Quick, Nest, Dive, Dusk, Timer], expires on October 2, 2023)
REV1VE (Five Rare Candies, expires on October 2, 2023)
I know some folks are kinda bummed that so many of these item rollouts are duds, but hey, it's something at least!
Also, remember a Palafin distribution is going on
All of these Mystery Gift codes dropped at once, including one for a special Palafin. That code is "0C1CV1CT0RGAV1N" if you haven't redeemed it yet.
We have more info on the Palafin itself here.

How to redeem Mystery Gift codes in Pokemon Scarlet & Violet
After the treasure hunt starts (read: following your full tour of the academy), you can select the mystery gift option in the main X button menu. Here's how to find the mystery gift menu:
Press X and select "Poke Portal"
On the Poke Portal screen, scroll down and find "mystery gift," then select that option
Select "get with code/password"
Enter the code(s)

First revealed during the 2022 Game Awards, Burning Shores unfolds after the events of Forbidden West as Aloy travels to the ruins of Los Angeles. The untamed area has become a seismically unstable, volcanic archipelago where a new menace and never-before-seen machines await Aloy, who's now joined by a mysterious new companion. 


Burning Shores is only available on PlayStation 5 and cost $19.99. Players will need to have completed the entirety of the main campaign to start the expansion. Once they have, Aloy will receive a call on her Focus which will kick off the DLC.

You've probably heard the horror stories, or at least, got the general gist that success in Japanese business often equates to time. You don't necessarily need to be doing work, you just need to be present as the clock hands shift. A hard worker is reduced to a statue that only springs to life again when their boss gets up to leave.
Mr. Saitou is a short pixel art RPG that offers a hilarious commentary on the absurdities of working culture in Japan, with occasional flashes of seriousness. Completable in one sitting, it's a game I'd recommend to anyone.

To celebrate the launch of the highly anticipated Tears of the Kingdom next month, you need to answer that all-important question — Which do you seek? Power, Wisdom, or Courage? That's right, it's all about the pieces of the Triforce, which is pretty darn fitting. Not only that but during the Tricolor Turf War, matches will take place in a unique triforce-shaped version of Scorch Gorge for this Splatfest only.

We are living in an unprecedentedly competitive attention economy, one in which time and energy are increasingly finite and precious. Because of this, it can be easy to overlook games which appear simple and unassuming at first glance: retro monochromatic Game Boy-style graphics, cute-but-childish anthropomorphic characters, 8-bit chiptune soundtrack — Melon Journey: Bittersweet Memories is an old-school adventure RPG nostalgia trip, sure, but it reconnects us to a simpler gaming time and it's got all the hallmarks of a future hidden gem.
The original Melon Journey was a small RPG maker game created over a decade ago by indie team Froach Club. It quickly became a cult classic, with a sold-out 'Pocket' version being released for Game Boy later this year by Limited Run Games. This new entry with the 'Bittersweet Memories' subtitle was created as less of a sequel to the original, and more of an expansion on the previous bite-sized explorative adventure.

[Update: The code has officially been unveiled! Input "0C1CV1CT0RGAV1N" into the mystery gift menu of the game to get Palafin in a Cherish Ball. You have through April 17 to claim it!]
We have yet another Pokemon Scarlet & Violet distribution on the horizon, and this one is already technically included in the game: Palafin. As you may know, acquiring Palafin in Scarlet & Violet is done by evolving Finizen at level 38 while using the (online) Union Circle system. Some folks haven't done this yet (or are unable to), so perhaps this distribution will help!
Here's the full tweet from the Play Pokemon Twitter account:
"Tune in for the 2023 European International Championships live stream starting April 14th for some fantastic #PokemonVG & #PokemonTCG gifts! Learn how to add Palafin to your team roster and Miraidon ex to your digital Pokémon TCG collection."

The accompanying news article has a bit more info on how it'll actually be distributed, and a confirmation that it's based on competitive Pokemon player Gavin Michael's Palafin:
"Wait for the password to appear during the 2023 EUIC broadcast, then go to the Mystery Gift feature in your game and enter the password to receive Gavin Michaels' Palafin—you can even add it to your next competitive team! This password can only be used once per save data."

So that's it! Wait for the code to arrive and enter it. Seems easy enough! We'll update you when that time comes. Until then, you can find all the info you need on the Palafin itself below.
Promo Gavin Michaels Palafin info:
Poké Ball: Cherish Ball
Gender: Female
Level: 50
Original Trainer: Gavin

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Update includes controversial anti-tamper software
A new update for Tango Gameworks' cyber-noir actioner Ghostwire: Tokyo has quietly added the controversial Denuvo anti-piracy technology to the title, over a year on from the game's initial release.
The addition, spotted by eagle-eyed players, was authenticated by DOSG after an experiment conducted by the website caused the title to flag authentication errors, revealing that Denuvo software was now implemented in the first-person adventure, which launched on PC in March 2022. The Denuvo software has been a source of irritance in the PC world, following frequent instances where the resource-hungry anti-tamper tech has, reportedly, caused performance issues in PC ports of popular titles.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN26_029gzY&ab_channel=BethesdaSoftworks
Just recently, Capcom removed Denuvo from the PC port of Resident Evil Village — a title that appeared to be hugely hindered by the addition of the software from a performance standpoint. The addition of Denuvo to Ghostwire: Tokyo, a title published by Bethesda Softworks, comes just weeks after the publisher has come under fire for announcing that its upcoming vampire hunter, Redfall, would also support the copy-protection software.
In addition to the implementation of Denuvo, the new Ghostwire: Tokyo update includes a selection of new missions, new combat abilities including "Charge Rush" and a new counter-attack skill, as well as new roguelite mode, which goes by the sinister title of The Spider's Thread. Ghostwire: Tokyo is available now on PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X.
Confirmed, Bethesda has added Denuvo to Ghostwire: Tokyo [DSOG]

It's a challenging climb yet a curiously chill vibe, perhaps because any time I fall all the way down, I'm delighted to be back surrounded by overgrown plants and sculptures rising from a pond. The developer says Beton Brutal "tries to replicate and build upon the parkour mechanics seen in Minecraft," and I think I have a lot to learn. I didn't even know Minecraft had parkour.

The info on Secrets Of Gloomrot doesn't actually use the F word anywhere, but it's a new biome "twisted by the tortured ambitions of a scientific genius and his legions of followers", so I feel pretty confident in the citation. This new free addition to the early access vampiric survival game - which won a few hearts here at RPS - is arriving on May 17th. That's Monday, that is, and boy, it's a biggun alright.

Let's talk about Ganondorf. Yes, that final trailer for The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom really was something, but what was the internet's biggest talking point once it was out in the open? Ganondorf got swole.
Now that we know of Ganondorf's appearance in TOTK, we've been reminiscing about all of the times that we have faced the Gerudo warlock in the past in an attempt to work out which version is the best. For many of us, our introduction to Ganon's human form came in Ocarina of Time, though with Big-G appearing on several separate occasions across a variety of mainline games and spin-offs, there are a good number of versions to choose between.

The suit, put together by 10 members of the public hailing from New Jersey and New Mexico, argues that Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard forms antitrust issues, suggesting that the purchase would result in the closure of rival studios, a rise in the price of games, and the inhibition of competition, among other negative effects.

Minecraft the game and Minecraft the franchise are two different, yet equally fascinating beasts.
Minecraft needs no explanation. If you’re reading this, I’m sure you already have an opinion on it. But its many spinoffs haven’t necessarily stayed true to more than Minecraft’s overall aesthetic. Minecraft: Story Mode gave us a Telltale narrative adventure when that was the rage, and Minecraft Dungeons asked “What if Minecraft was Diablo?” Minecraft Legends is the newest game in this extended Minecraftian Universe, this time introducing the blocky world to the strategy genre.
Some may take umbrage with these Minecraft spinoffs, but I’m in favor of them. I never got invested in Minecraft proper; I just wasn’t in the right time and place at the height of its popularity. That s…]]></summary>

Mojang Studios has returned to the crafting table in an attempt to take Minecraft in a bold new direction. Minecraft Legends is an open-world real-time strategy game where you gather resources, build defenses, and summon adorable mercenaries to protect the sanctity of the realm. Instead of the birds-eye perspective often featured in strategy games, Legends opts for a character-focused view, with your hero roaming the landscape on dynamic mounts, sword in hand, using resources and armies to e…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Surveying the sprawling piglin outpost before me, a plan forms. With a flourish of button presses from my controller, I spawn a sizeable army of zombies. They'll zomble their way up the main path, and with their high health pools they'll cut into the vast piglin forces and buy me time. With another flourish a contingent of friendly creepers scuttles along behind me. I lead them on a flanking attack around the outpost, targeting their spawners while the main piglin army is occupied with my frontal assault. A masterpiece of tactical engineering!
Or it would have been, if my minions weren't so bloody stupid. Half my zombies fell off the staircase they were climbing due to their terrible pathfinding, and burned up in the lava moat below. Meanwhile, I sent my creepers off to explode against the first spawner I found. Only one of them got there; the others relentlessly humped a wall they could easily have climbed, until Piglins surrounded and slaughtered them. I returned to my starting point with what remained of my army, a fair bit poorer in resources, and a great deal poorer in patience.
Welcome to Minecraft Legends, a strange mixture of real-time strategy and open-world adventure which frustrates and impresses in equal measure. There's half a great game lurking here, but it's marred by inadequacies that have nibbled away at me like piglins at my walls. This game could have been so much more.

Voice overs are still relatively new in the Zelda series, and now the latest trailer for The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom has revealed Ganondorf's return.
If you are wondering who is behind the voice, it's Matthew Mercer - known as Cole Cassidy (McCree) in the Overwatch series, Leon S. Kennedy in Resident Evil 6 and more recently as Chrom in Fire Emblem Engage. He's also worked on a lot of anime from Attack on Titan, One Piece to Hunter x Hunter.

We've just been bombarded with all sorts of new information about The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and if this wasn't already enough, a leaked TV advertisement for the upcoming release has now leaked online. It's surfaced on the Zelda subreddit and it's unclear exactly where it came from, but Nintendo likely won't be happy.
The title describes it as a "slightly unfinished version" of the American live-action television spot. In it, you can see Link assembling a vehicle, taking on a spoiler... three-headed "Flame Gleeok" (seemingly confirming some previous rumours), and lighting up a darkened area with some rather unique arrows.

It’s not even a slow news day, but someone needs to talk about the rampant shirtlessness that’s going on in Hyrule these days. If someone is even wearing a shirt, it’s very likely that it is only half a shirt. Zelda has long been the series of choice for people who leave the camera lingering on a character’s physique for an inappropriate amount of time, ever since the Great Fairy popped out of Ocarina of Time. This kind of discourse is important, regardless of whether or not it will be forgotten about in a week’s time.

Final Fantasy XVI follows Clive, the protagonist, through three different parts of his life. Part of it shows him as a young teen, then again in his 20s, and later in his 30s. The warrior finds himself set on a quest for revenge across the world of Valisthea, dealing with the politics and powers of the supernatural Eikons and massive crystals along the way.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today’s PlayStation State of Play was devoted entirely to showcasing new footage and information for Final Fantasy XVI, giving fans a guided tour of its action, exploration, characters, and more.


The presentation showed off a hefty amount of the flashy action RPG combat we recently got to sample in a recent hands-on demo. Though the story begins by following protagonist Clive in his 20s, the plot will also explore periods of his teen years and 30s. We got a look at the world map, various accessibility rings, and the combat prowess of Clive’s faithful wolf companion, Torgal. 
We also looked at Cid’s hideaway, a large headquarters that opens up later in the game where you can craft gear, buy items at a store, check quests, interact with allies, and practice abilities in a special training room. Despite showing off so much, teases that Square Enix still has plenty to share in the future regarding story quests, side quests, and endgame content. 
Final Fantasy XVI launches on June 22 for PlayStation 5. You can learn more about the game by reading our recent features breaking down the game's Eikon combat, Arcade Mode, and interviews with the developers who discuss the game's balance of multiple gameplay styles, its return to high-fantasy, and the series' abandonment of turn-based action.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Steam Deck is powered by SteamOS, a custom Linux-based operating system developed specifically for running Steam and its games. It's possible to install Windows on your Steam Deck if you wish, but the drivers are rudimentary and there are a bunch of obstacles when it comes to controlling Windows via Steam Deck's controls or its touchscreen.

A leaked project from an internal Microsoft hackathon shows that staff at the operating system developer have noticed these issues - although it sounds like a version of Windows optimised for gaming handhelds is a long way off.

Warner Bros. Games and Rocksteady have officially moved the Suicide Squad into 2024. Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League has been delayed to February 2, 2024.
A report from Bloomberg in March said that Warner Bros. was looking at moving Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League from its May date out to sometime later this year. Today's news pushes it even further out, roughly nine months away.
"We have made the tough but necessary decision to take the time needed to work on getting the game to be the best quality experience for players," reads today's statement on social media. "Thank you to our amazing community for the continued support, patience and understanding. There is much more to share in the months ahead and we looked forward to seeing you in Metropolis next year."

The Justice League lives, for now
Rocksteady's four-player co-op action game has been in development for some time, and already experienced some delays. Major shifts like this are not too uncommon, but the suddenness, combined with previous delays, makes Suicide Squad's case a bit stranger.
We had also just seen a significant chunk of this game at a recent Sony State of Play. The full co-op gameplay showcase didn't get everyone on-board with the direction though, and growing concern over a live service-focused structure took root.
So, now, Rocksteady's co-op Suicide Squad game is pushing the launch time back further. With an actual date set, that's at least something. But even the concept of February 2024 seems so distant right now, I've got to wonder what sentiment will be like when Warner Bros. and Rocksteady resurface later on.
Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League is now launching on February 2, 2024 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League has been delayed to next year following recent rumors that it wasn't going to make its May 26 release date. 
The superhero co-op shooter will now launch on February 2, 2024. Developer Rocksteady posted a short message on Twitter stating it wants to “take the time needed” to ensure the best possible experience. Check it out below.
Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League puts players in the shoes of Harley Quinn, Captain Boomerang, Deadshot, and King Shark as they fight to rescue Metropolis from an invasion by Brainiac. The villain has hijacked the minds of the Justice League, meaning the Squad has to take down Earth's greatest protectors to save the day. The game has received a hefty dose of fan vitriol since its last gameplay demonstration in February confirmed an always-online requirement as well as live service elements, such as a cosmetics-only battle pass. Other fans have found its cooperative loot-based shooting to be an uninspired fit for the property.
Although we don't know the specifics behind the delay, sources told Bloomberg in its original report last month that Rocksteady was only pushing the game to add polish and did not plan to overhaul the game’s existing framework. Even though a nearly-year-long delay is a lot of time, it's still very unlikely that it's enough for the team to make the sort of dramatic changes some fans are hoping for. We'll have to wait and see how Rocksteady spruces up the Suicide Squad and hope it results in a quality experience when the dust finally settles.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Library of Congress announced its 2023 class of National Recording Registry inductees, and it includes a video game song for the first time. That big honor goes to the classic Super Mario Bros. theme.
Officially titled “Ground Theme,” it was composed by Nintendo’s Koji Kondo and first appeared in 1985’s Super Mario Bros in World 1-1. The song has since become the most well-known melody of the Mario franchise, not to mention one of the most recognizable music tracks in video games. Now, it will be forever preserved alongside some of pop culture's most famous and influential songs. 
“Having this music preserved alongside so many other classic songs is such a great honor,” said Kondo in a statement. “It's actually a little bit difficult to believe.”
Mario’s classic tune will be inducted alongside heavy hitters such as Madonna’s “Like a Virgin,” Jimmy Buffet’s “Margaritaville,” Queen Latifah’s “All Hail the Queen,” and Mariah Carey’s “All I Want for Christmas is You.” You can read the full list of inductees at the Libary of Congress’ website. 
This is quite an achievement for Nintendo and especially Kondo, who has lent his talents to numerous other Nintendo soundtracks and also had a hand in composing the music for the very successful The Super Mario Bros. Movie. You can read our recent interview with Kondo and Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto about the making of the film here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sing with me, sing for the year
Musical role-playing adventure Stray Gods is charting a course for launch. The vocal venture will kick off on August 3 for PC.
The debut game from Summerfall Studios, Stray Gods is a story about Grace, who gets caught up in the life and drama of Greek gods after she's made the prime suspect in the death of Calliope. In the process, she comes into some new powers, and will have the opportunity to discover the truth. Maybe she can even find some romance on the side?
This quest for truth, answers, and heavenly connections plays out in interactive musical form. Characters break out into song, and the player gets to make choices about the tone of Grace's responses, potentially shifting the overall tenor and direction of the song.

The voice of the gods
It's a pretty fascinating system, with former Dragon Age writer David Gaider penning the script. And alongside an interesting premise and narrative framing, there's also a host of voice talent signed on. Here's a rundown of the voice actors working on Stray Gods:
Laura Bailey as Grace
Troy Baker as Apollo
Mary Elizabeth McGlynn as Persephone
Janina Gavankar as Freddie
Khary Payton as Pan
Abubakar Salim as Eros
Felicia Day as Athena
Rahul Kohli as Minotaur
Allegra Clark as Hecate
Merle Dandridge as Aphrodite
Erika Ishii as Hermes
Ashley Johnson as Calliope
Lauren "Lolo" Spencer as Venus
Anjali Bhimani as Medusa
Kimberly Brooks as Oracle
Anthony Rapp as Orpheus
Throw in Austin Wintory as composer, alongside musicians Scott Edgar, Steven Gates, Simon Hall of Tripod, and Jess Cerro (Montaigne), and it's a lot of talent.
Honestly, I am very curious to see how an interactive musical like this would shake out. These branching paths intrigue me, as does the Greek pantheon theming around a murder mystery. We'll see how Summerfall's debut Stray Gods comes together on August 3.

Infinity Ward released a new type of cosmetic bundle in the Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 and Warzone 2.0 store that is stirring up quite the controversy. The new Bomb Squad bundle offers certain DMZ players an advantage through its otherwise innocuous items, and much of the community is unhappy about this.
DMZ Bomb Squad Season 3 bundle, released
The new Bomb Squad cosmetic bundle is far different than anything else Infinity Ward and Activision has done before. This bundle includes five seemingly normal cosmetic items:
EOD Specialist operator skin
Boom Proof Sakin MG38 weapon blueprint
DMZ Active Duty Slot
Concussive Conclusion weapon sticker
Which Wire? Emblem
From a glance, this seems like a fairly ordinary bundle like all of the other ones in the…]]></summary>

With just under a month to go until the release of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, Nintendo has dropped its third and final trailer for the game, and wow, what a trailer! This is undoubtedly one for the ages; a trailer to surely rival the Switch Presentation trailer for Breath of the Wild from 2017.
Naturally, there's an awful lot to unpack with this one, but unpack it we must. We've scoured through the trailer to pick out every interesting little nugget, and it's all laid out below just for you. We're nice like that.

It might not be the first weapon that you would think to bring to the battlefield, but hey, just sausage roll with it (again, we're sorry).

More than anything, I was impressed at just how good we have it in the multiplayer FPS genre at the moment. Apex Legends, Warzone 2, Overwatch 2, Valorant, Rainbow Six Siege. That's some unbelievably tough competition. XDefiant has to either give players something completely different, or absolutely nail the basics. It's opted for the second path, and having played several matches against a medley of press people and content creators, I'm not convinced Ubisoft's new arena shooter is up to the challenge.

Frictional Games has announced that a last-minute delay has affected its upcoming horror sequel Amnesia: The Bunker, which will no longer meet its May 16 release date — The first-person spooker will now launch on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms one week later on May 23.
"We’re pushing the release of Amnesia: The Bunker back by one week, and it will now be coming out on May 23 instead," noted the indie developer on Twitter. "This will give us a little more time to polish the game and make sure everything is perfect before launch. We appreciate your patience and hope you are looking forward to playing Amnesia: The Bunker. It will be worth the wait!"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6hfkkw6aKE&ab_channel=frictionalgames
The latest in the streamer-friendly horror series, Amnesia: The Bunker sees the player take up the role of a French soldier deep in the misery and isolation of World War I. Trapped in an abandoned bunker, the protagonist must pick their way through the darkness, solving puzzles and attempting to stay one step ahead of a mysterious and frightening force that lurks within the shadows and corridors of this living hellhole.
Amnesia: The Bunker hopes to bring new and unique mechanics to the franchise, including a sandbox approach to player choice, emergent gameplay, and constant alterations to the environment in order to provide variety and individuality to the player's experience. A grim story of survival, and the will to live in even the direst of circumstances, hopes to deliver the psychological horror that is the Amnesia trademark.
Amnesia: The Bunker launches May 23 on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

Despite its following and my love of city builders, I haven’t been paying much attention to Against the Storm. That changes today, as Hooded Horse has announced the latest update to Eremite Games’ Early Access settlement game.
The Sentinels of the Forest update expands Against the Storm with a new playable race of fox people (the fifth species in the game), as well as their faction-specific technologies. Apparently, the Foxes work with “rainwater-fueled technologies,” but most importantly, they make tea. There are both tea houses that can be built, as well as tea doctors, which heal people using the powers of tea.
Check out the new trailer below, courtesy of GameTrailers.
https://youtu.be/vPdCARWzUYE
I also use tea to cure all my ills. Specifically, if I feel tired in the morning (which is every morning), I usually drink two pots of tea and follow it up with a nap. That usually gets me the energy I need to make it to lunch.
Against the Storm is a city builder that has you build to survive torrents of corrupting rain. Rather than focus on a single settlement, you work to connect a network of them with previous towns assisting newly built ones. It bills itself as a roguelite, where certain portions of your progress are carried over to new games, and “hundreds” of gameplay modifiers ensure that no two playthroughs are the same.
Damn. I’m going to have to check this out.
Against the Storm is currently in Early Access on PC. There's a demo available if you're curious. If everything is on track, the full release should come in a few months. The Sentinels of the Forest update hits today.

If Warhammer 40,000 is too futuristic for you and you’ve wanted to dial it back a bit, Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun might be the game for you. Styling itself after late-‘90s shooters, Boltgun strips away distracting graphics and asks you to just shoot the crap out of everything in front of you. And now, we’ve got a date for it: May 23, 2023.
I know so very little about Warhammer 40,000. This 30-second trailer tells me absolutely nothing about the property, while at the same time telling me everything I need to know about the game. There’s jumping. There are people blowing up. And everything is pixelated.
https://youtu.be/DJzGLICnZrg
Honestly, I’ve played tons of Total War: Warhammer, which is sort of unrelated? Like, it's a different universe or something. However, you don’t really need much context for it. There are vampires, beastmen, and BDSM elves, and that’s all you need to know. Or, at least, that’s all I need to know.
Similarly, Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun has it all: rocket launchers, shotguns, and bloody messes. You play as a space person, and I may be an outlier here, but I really hope that they don’t make constant wisecracks. That part can stay in the ‘90s.
Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun is coming to PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PC, and Switch on May 23, 2023.

If you haven't watched the final pre-launch trailer yet, then you might be a little bit confused. Before today, we've only seen the Demon King as a rather "unhydrated", bone-y looking being. But as of today, we've seen him in the flesh — literally.

Marvelous news for fantasy fans, as THQ Nordic has announced a new chapter in the beloved adventure series, Trine — Trine 5: A Clockwork Conspiracy is currently in the works at studio Frozenbyte, and is expected to launch this summer on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms.
The new sequel will reunite heroes Amadeus the Wizard, Zoya the Thief, and Pontius the Knight, as the trio embarks upon a brand new quest that will see them take on the might of the fearsome Clockwork Army.

The trailer is suitably delightful, spotlighting a colorful and whimsical kingdom, cool-looking character abilities, and a typically spirited sense of adventure. With all of these new features on deck, it's looking like Trine 5 could prove to be a real treat for series fans.

During the 2022 Game Awards, Immortals of Aveum was announced with a teaser trailer that arguably leaned too much on teasing. The quick video featured out-of-context voiceovers from unseen characters talking about war while showcasing some kind of gauntlet. Cut to a character, from the first-person perspective, walking through a door and into a battlefield with dragons flying overhead, explosions, and soldiers running with purpose. The character then lifts their arm into frame to show the gauntlet… and that was it. Now, four months later, developer Ascendant has revealed substantially more about the gam…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Companions, villagers, and the return of a king
Nintendo aired the final pre-launch trailer for The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom today, and it was quite a doozy. From more story context and mechanical teases to the confirmation of a longtime series villain, there's a lot to unpack.
While the general story set-up still feels a little unclear, we do know one thing for sure: Ganondorf is back. The king of the Gerudo appears a few times in today's trailer, and also seems to be speaking over the trailer at a few points. Zelda also looks to be lost, in some way; we catch a glimpse of Link failing to catch and save her, and then again, her calling for Link to come find her.
Even further, we see Hyrule alive in a pretty spectacular way. Not only are there towns popping up in the ruins of the land, but we see villagers fighting enemies, and companions teaming up with Link. Heck yes, Sidon and Link can fight together!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHGShqcAHlQ
The kingdom closes in
This is the third official trailer, and also the last one before The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom launches next month. Compared to previous games, even its predecessor Breath of the Wild, it's felt like we haven't seen a ton about this entry. Then again, that's mostly been working, in my opinion.
The recent gameplay showcase did spotlight Link's new abilities, seemingly linked to his arm. Today's showcase went even further in though, showing all the wild ways in which they can be used. Cars and flying machines are one thing, but in the trailer today we see Link carting around villagers with a horse-drawn carriage and fighting a walking bokoblin fortress.
Add in a bunch of wild machinery and possible Zonai influence, and I feel like I've got even more questions now. All in all, a pretty solid video to pick apart in the last month leading up to Tears of the Kingdom's launch on May 12.

If you are thinking that this seems lower than previous weeks, you would be correct (the game had 21,014 sales last week), but with the absence of any new titles in the top ten, the chart is mostly undisturbed. The PS4 version of Resident Evil 4 beat its PS5 counterpart to second place this week and the rest of the table is a Nintendo-fest.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At PAX West in Seattle last year, I had the pleasure of interviewing the voice cast of Team Fortress 2. I chatted to John Patrick Lowrie (The Sniper), Gary Schwartz (The Heavy, The Demoman), Robin Atkin Downes (The Medic) and Ellen McLain (The Administrator) about the game's fifteen year long legacy, the process of finding their character's voices as well as their favourite quotes. It was a riot of an interview and, to be honest, a bit of a career highlight. It also did really well on TikTok, which I have mixed feelings about.

Fifteen minutes after the gang left the grimy conference room in which the interview took place (I had immediately crawled onto the floor in an attempt to ease the anxiety from having conducted said interview), I got a Twitter notification. Robin had posted a video. Following our chat, the group had attempted to order a sandwich from a cafe in-character, leaving the staff completely bemused as a result. Understandably the video did numbers, and over the last six months, the gang have been releasing new episodes in what is now known as "The Sandvich Saga" on a regular basis.

While Pokemon Scarlet & Violet copies continue to fly off the shelves, we're getting a decent chunk of content rollouts in the form of seven-star raids. But Game Freak and The Pokemon Company also have an overwhelming amount of tiny promo events going on too, including this upcoming opportunity to get a new backpack style.
Announced on the official Japanese Pokemon site,  the powers that be are running a promo for the upcoming Pokémon Japan Championships 2023 (also known as PJCS2023). All you have to do is play three matches and be connected to Pokemon Home.
How to get the Scarlet & Violet Great Ball backpack
The entry period for the event is from April 13 at 9AM JST through April 21 at 8:59AM JST. From there, the event will kickoff directly after from April 21 at 9AM JST through April 24 at 8:59AM JST. Here is a full list of Pokemon that you're allowed to enter.
Note that this is a participation reward, so you can play three matches, win or lose, and still pick up the bonus. You'll also get 10,000 LP (League Points) for your efforts.
The code will actually be doled out through Pokemon Home, which you can then input in Scarlet & Violet via the Mystery Gift system. Yeah, that's not complicated at all! Maybe one day you can just get the reward directly in-game when participating in an online event instead of jumping through hoops.

The GeForce RTX 4070 launches with a heavier price tag than the RTX 3070, and doesn’t make the shin-splintering performance leap forward that its predecessor did, but between its high speeds, low power usage, and DLSS 3 advantage, it’s a potent upgrade regardless.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Y can't Sims crawl?
Thanks to a reader, this lengthy thread of Sims 4 fun facts from Twitter user OnlyAbiDoang came across my desk and I couldn't look away. Even if you haven't played The Sims series yet you likely know someone who has: or at least experienced it by osmosis through some sort of weird factoid throughout the years. It's that ubiquitous. But I didn't realize just how wacky I could get.
https://twitter.com/onlyabidoang/status/1640039940640890880
Here are a few choice facts from the thread:
If you get struck by lightning in The Sims 4: Seasons you either die outright or you can wield the power of electricity like a superhero
You can spy on the Grim Reaper (yes, Death himself) using a listening bug and hear his conversations
Normally only child Sim characters can see elaborate imagination sequences playing out, but an adult with the childish trait can secretly view them too
You can complain about food poisoning and get compensation
The thread goes on for a long while, and it's great "weekend reading" material. It's essentially a series of Easter eggs and glitches/exploits, some of which yield some crazy results that are hilarious both in and out of context.
Every so often I dive back into The Sims and marvel at how well it's been supported over the years, and how many quality of life features have been implemented since launch. It doesn't hold my attention as much as a lot of other games, but it's a decent reminder of how great Maxis could be as a studio.

The National Recording Preservation Board (NRPB) has announced that Koji Kondo's iconic Super Mario Bros. theme is to be inducted for preservation in the U.S. Library of Congress. The instantly recognizable ditty will be the first piece of video game music ever to join the NRPB's catalog of significant compositions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTa6Xbzfq1U&ab_channel=ultragamemusic
Each year, the NRPB selects 25 pieces of music that it deems "culturally, historically or aesthetically significant, and/or informs or reflects life in the United States". I like to think that the Super Mario Bros. Theme falls into the latter category. Kondo's simple but endlessly entering tune — officially known upon conception as simply "Ground Theme" made its debut in World 1-1 of 1985 NES release Super Mario Bros. It has since been remixed and used endless times for various Nintendo titles, TV shows, and commercials.
Joining Mario in the library this year will also be guitar shop nightmare "Stairway to Heaven" by Led Zeppelin, Madonna's censor bothering "Like a Virgin", Eurythmics "Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)", John Lennon's "Imagine" and, from the goddess of winter herself, Mariah Carey's "All I Want for Christmas is You". For all you midwestern dads, Jimmy Buffet is getting representation via his 1977 hit "Margaritaville".
Sadly, there is no sign of my personal favorite Super Mario Bros. tune, "Take on Me" by a-ha.

Alongside concerns that the system introduces a single "point of failure" that could undermine the security of national networks, ISPs believe they could be held liable when over-blocking enters the equation. More generally, consumers could end up paying for blocking, rather than the rightsholders set to benefit from it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Xbox fans eager to jump into Redfall next month will initally have to make do with only one graphics option as the game won’t be launching with a Performance mode.
In a tweet, Arkane reveals that only Quality mode will be available when the game releases on May 2. A 60 FPS Performance option is coming at an unspecified date, but until it does, here’s how the game will run depending on your hardware:
Xbox Series X - 4K 30 FPS
Xbox Series S - 1440p 30 FPS
Sounds like PC is the way to go if you value performance over resolution, but hopefully, it doesn’t take too long for the option to appear on console. For more on Redfall, you can listen to our interview with Arkane Studios’ Harvey Smith in this episode of The Game Informer Show, then check out this article revealing the canceled PlayStation 5 version of the game.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Frogwares are in a bit of a tight spot at the moment, being as they are a Ukranian studio. If I was trying to make video games in a warzone and: a) my last game was a big sexy prequel to my long running Sherlock Holmes series; b) the one before that was a Lovecraftian detective game with pretty recent assets; and c) my back catalogue contained a Lovecraft-themed Sherlock Holmes mystery, then I'd probably do what they've done with Sherlock Holmes The Awakened. Which is to remake the old Lovecraft-themed Sherlock Holmes game, but with new assets.
It's also got new puzzles and areas, and a slightly rewritten story to account for this being a sequel to Sherlock Holmes: Chapter One. It's a smaller, less ambitious game than Chapter One with some jank knocking around, and I wouldn't recommend it if you're not a fan of the series, but you know what? I think there's a glimmer of greatness in the very fact of its constraints.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Illumination’s The Super Mario Bros. Movie has become a staggering box office success since its premiere last week. The animated adaptation of Nintendo’s flagship franchise has emerged from its first weekend as the best opening animated film of all time, achieving several other records along the way. 
According to The Hollywood Reporter, the film walked away with over $375 million in sales in its first five days, surpassing Frozen 2 as the top opening animated film premiere globally. That includes a $206 million domestic haul, $146 million of which was earned over the weekend (remember the film premiered on a Wednesday). Overseas, the movie has earned over $173 million.
Additionally, The Super Mario Bros. Movie is now the top opening film of 2023 (beating Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania), has become Illumination’s most successful opening, and has the best opening of any video game film adaptation (surpassing Sonic the Hedgehog 2's debut). The film also has the biggest five-day premiere ever, a record previously held by Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen. If all of that wasn’t enough, the film also has the biggest IMAX opening weekend of all time at $21.6 million globally.
Needless to say, The Super Mario Bros. Movie is exceeding expectations, and it’ll be interesting to see if it can maintain such a strong start. To get an idea of how it fares, you can read our review of the film here. Be sure to also check out our interviews with the movie’s cast and Nintendo’s own Shigeru Miyamoto and Koji Kondo.]]></summary>

Most of the game’s requirements seem pretty standard for a modern open-world game, although you’ll need some pretty powerful CPUs and GPUs to run the sequel at recommended settings and above. Ripping into hordes in graphic details might cost you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[‘The Tank’, I’ll admit, is a monumentally uninspired name for the mace-wielding brick privy of a man I’d bestowed the dubious honour of soaking up hits in place of my squishier mercs, but when sandbox tactical RPG Wartales let me assemble a party of 12 mad lasses and tapped chaps, the stash of good nicknames was always going to be the first casualty. So, The Tank he lived, and also died. Questing endlessly in this grimy medieval world won’t cut it. You’ll also need to keep your troupe paid and fed, so when evening fell to find nought but a handful of foraged mushrooms and a single mouldy apple I’d pried from the fingertips of a disemboweled bandit, it was time to get creative.
“Waste not, want not”, said the Earl of Human Sandwich, the inventor of cannibalism (I’m told). With this in mind, I’d invested one of my early ‘Knowledge Points’ into a tech that let me repurpose my dearly departed as delicious drumsticks. Slain friendlies don’t disappear after battle. Instead, you’ll find their tastefully dressed corpses in the loot menu afterwards. Ghoulishly, the ‘loot all’ option doesn’t add their cadavers to your inventory with the rest. You’ll have to manually drag them over, giving you just enough time to consciously make the decision to either bury or eat them. I did not bury him.

The Vampire Diaries follows Elena Gilbert, a high school student who discovers vampires are living in her hometown after one of them attacks her younger sister. The game is loosely based on the book series of the same name by author L. J. Smith, which later got adapted into a hit TV series.
Nancy Drew: Secrets Can Kill is the first installment of the long-running Nancy Drew game series, also based on a book series of the same name. In her first adventure, Nancy seeks to uncover the killer of a high school student who seems to have been disliked by all of his classmates.
You will need the data files from the games’ original install CDs, and a fresh daily build of ScummVM. Apart from the original release, Secrets Can Kill’s Russian translation is also supported. The ScummVM wiki pages for The Vampire Diaries and Nancy Drew: Secrets Can Kill contain information on which datafiles are needed. Please, report any problems you encounter in our issue tracker.

Normally this drive retails for about £200 in its massive 2TB incarnation, but now you can pick up this drive for just £152.99 at Ebuyer in the UK - a great deal on a drive that we've named as the very fastest PCIe 4.0 SSD for shorter loading times.

Now another such mod has reached the point of Alyx being fully playable from start to finish on a regular monitor with keyboard and mouse. This new mod looks more polished than some others, and claims it's the "easiest to use and most flexible" of the lot. I'm not too interested in a VRless Alyx but I'm sure it's welcome news to some.

        <updated>2023-04-11T16:01:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For April's issue of Game Informer magazine, we took a look behind the scenes at Hyper Light Breaker, the latest game from developer Heart Machine. In addition to an interview with Creative Director Alx Preston, we were able to view exclusive footage of one of the game's mini-bosses, The Last Master. Check out the reveal below.


The Last Master is a deadly opponent that spawns randomly when players (known in this world as Breakers) activate beacons, objects that allow them to access the main boss gate. If you think she looks similar to the player characters, you've got the right idea; in the video, Preston says "She ended up here in this land as a Breaker and succumbed to the dangers of the Overgrowth." As a result, The Last Master's arsenal mirrors yours, wielding a sword, a spear, and an automatic pistol. Her behavior mirrors the Breakers' as well, and she can dash, jump, and climb after anyone that attempts to escape.
While the first game in the Hyper Light franchise was a 2D single-player experience, this new title is a 3-player co-op rogue-lite, with a new procedurally generated open world on every run. Players will create a Breaker, explore a cursed land called the Overgrowth, and attempt to the bosses plaguing this realm known as Crowns.

For more of the game, check out our feature in the latest issue of Game Informer. You also can see the initial reveal trailer here and the IGN's gameplay reveal right here. Hyper Light Breaker enters early access this fall.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Diablo IV arrives this summer, and it's making one last stop on the cover of Game Informer! We spoke with several of the game’s principal designers at Blizzard to learn more about the game’s endgame content, such as Helltides and Nightmare Dungeons, and provide a final overview of everything the game has to offer before it launches on June 6.
Setting the table for Diablo IV’s dark tone are two haunting pieces of cover art designed by the famed artist Brom. Our standard cover showcases the heavenly might of the rogue angel Inarius while the Game Informer Gold cover features Lilith, Diablo IV’s main antagonist, in all her demonic glory.
Issue 355 also includes a conversation about life and death with former Tango Gameworks artist and director Ikumi Nakamura in the abandoned streets of late-night Tokyo (which you can read online). You’ll also find an entertaining personal story about using VR as a carnival scam, a feature detailing Devil May Cry 5’s influence on Final Fantasy XVI’s combat, and an emotional piece discussing how a grieving father found solace in the Shenmue series’ depiction of loss. You'll also be treated to previews for upcoming titles, including Redfall, Exoprimal, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, and Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. 
You can also try to nab a Game Informer Gold version of the issue. Limited to a numbered print run per issue, this premium version of Game Informer isn't available for sale. To learn about places where you might be able to get a copy, check out our official Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram, and stay tuned for more details in the coming weeks.

We’re standing at a slaughterhouse. But it’s a slaughterhouse in a deeply strange location, or, as Nakamura calls it, “Silicon Valley,” the technology district of Shinagawa in Tokyo, Japan. As I look at trucks packed full of cows at – whether they know it or not – the end of their lives, immense skyscrapers surround us, housing tech goliaths. Sony, Canon, and Microsoft all have offices here. The lifeblood of Japan’s tech industry, all looking down at death, turned to process.

The event, which has previously been held in Japan, will take place in Seattle. It serves as a large convention that will allow Nintendo enthusiasts to play popular Switch titles, take photos with Mario and other characters, and enjoy live entertainment, including game tournaments. The event will also feature a number of Nintendo-themed activities scattered across the venue. 
“Fans of all ages can currently experience the unique games, characters and worlds of Nintendo on Nintendo Switch, but we want to expand that scope with a new experience,” said Nintendo of America President Doug Bowser in a press release. “With Nintendo Live 2023, we’re giving attendees a chance to celebrate together with family, friends and the broader Nintendo community in the spirit of fun and creating long-lasting memories.”
There’s no information on the exact date or location for the event nor when ticket sales begin, but you can keep an eye on the event’s official website to learn more once those details become available. Nintendo is enjoying a wave of positive momentum this year following the opening of its second Super Nintendo World theme park at Universal Studios Hollywood as well as the successful premiere of The Super Mario Bros. Movie.

In his weekly newsletter for the Guardian, Keith Stewart laments the recent cancellation of this year's in-person E3, highlighting the loss of access an event like E3 offers to journalists that can't be replicated by a glut of sterile, online showcases.
Following the passing of legendary composer Ryuichi Sakamoto last week, Mat Ombler has documented his effect on the world of video games. Featuring quotes from Jesper Kyd, Takeshi Furukawa and Yuji Naka, it's clear that Sakamoto's influence on the way games sound cannot be understated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In 2012, Double Fine Productions launched a Kickstarter campaign to make an adventure game.
At the time, the idea was that the adventure genre was dead – at least in the eyes of major publishers. However, as Double Fine founder Tim Schafer, who made his name working on point-and-click adventure games for LucasArts, seemed to think, there was still a sizable enough audience out there that someone should make a new one. Why not Double Fine? And why not go directly to the source – the fans – for the game's funding?
In Double Fine's pitch, it theorized the then-unnamed project as a smaller game. The company asked for $400,000 from fans – specifically $300,000 to make the game and $100,000 to allow documentary crew 2 Player Productions to film the development. On that last point, Double Fine wo…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[OpenTTD 13.0 has been out for two months and we’ve found some bugs to fix. Most notably, we’ve fixed two kinds of crashes: Road vehicles inside multi-track level crossings no longer crash into the side of trains. The game no longer crashes when a spectator in a network game tries to interact with a town’s local authority. For NewGRF authors using the new engine variant feature introduced in 13.0, we’ve added a callback to select how the engine’s name is displayed in the buy menu. As always, there are plenty of other bugfixes, which you can find in the changelog. Download Changelog Bug tracker]]></summary>

It will now cost $60 rather than the previously planned $50, is no longer bundled together with ARK 2, and will instead include the remasters of Ark: Survival Evolved's several expansions - although most won't be available at launch.

Studio Wildcard also went into more detail as to why this upgraded version is no longer a free update, and why they feel it's necessary to shut down Ark: Survival Evolved's official servers.

McGee says that Electronic Arts have decided to pass on the project. As such, McGee says he has "reached an endpoint with 'Alice' and with game production in general."

That makes this Micro SD a premiere option for Steam Deck owners, who will benefit from faster copying times when transferring game directories from the internal storage to Micro SD or downloading from the internet, and game load times should also be as speedy as anything with this A2-rated drive.

Which is strange, since Muv-Luv is considered by many to be one of the most greatest visual novels of all time. What begins as a light-hearted slice-of-life high school romantic comedy eventually pulls the rug out from under the player, and transforms into a war epic featuring mechs and aliens with a much darker tone. In Muv-Luv’s original Japanese release, this twist was hidden and only briefly hinted at in the marketing.
Today both Muv-Luv games are easily available on Steam, marketed specifically with this twist, and where they sit fully-translated and with Overwhelmingly Positive reviews. iOS and Android ports are apparently in development, and other Muv-Luv spin-offs continue to get translated. But the first time anyone experienced a complete English language version of Muv-Luv was in July 2010, when a fan translation group called Amaterasu released a patch localising the first game.

I could call it a 2D beat 'em up with your classic heavy/light attacks (actually punch/kick, but whatever), which is important to mention. It's also tempting to namedrop the things it reminded me of, like Hotline Miami, Beraltors, and a tiny hint of The Cat Lady, but that could get you picturing just about anything, and is unfairly reductive to a game that has the right to stand on its own.
Pill Baby is, obviously, all those things. It's far better and more coherent than any of those descriptions would make it sound.

Mr. Sun’s Hatbox answers all of those questions (very seriously) in a genre-blending comedy. When I say genre-blending, I mean this is a platforming roguelike with extensive base-building, shooting, whacking, stealthing, and a heavy dose of Metal Gear Solid 5. Seriously.

The same Pirate Party previously ran at least three pirate sites, and a court even declared the most recent one legal.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The long-running sci-fi series Battlestar Galactica received a turn-based strategy spin-off a couple years ago. Focusing on the epic space battles alone, Battlestar Galactica Deadlock was generally well-reviewed at its launch in 2017, and it’s become increasingly popular in the years since, thanks to hefty post-launch support and a lack of other BSG-related things going on. Luckily, Battlestar Galactica Deadlock is now free to keep on Steam until 6pm BST/ 10am PT/ 1pm ET on April 9th.

starts by suggesting that you play the original game's tutorial. This is included as part of the experience, which, as we'll get to, says a lot about how this sequel has been designed. 


In any case, I disregarded this advice. "I don't need an instruction manual for post-apocalyptic survival," I thought. I've rummaged through this particular abandoned house countless times, after all: In DayZ, in Dead Island, in State Of Decay, in Days Gone. I even reviewed the first Saints And Sinners back in February 2020. I know my way around a zombie's cranium better than anyone.

Anyone who has a copy of Backyard Football, Backyard Baseball 2001, and even Backyard Football 2002 (which was originally a LAN-only title) can download the latest daily build* of ScummVM and play online games against real people!
This all became possible because the three developers from the Backyard Sports Online fork had joined the team and brought their services with them to the ScummVM. These are LittleToonCat, Jim “jibbodahibbo” Westerkamp and Sam “QuestionMonkey” Kupfer.
Please note that Backyard Football and Backyard Baseball 2001 require online accounts for the complete online experience, so you need to register to Backyard Sports Online, which is our fantastic online-play service and a thriving community of fellow Backyard Sports players, they even have a couple of competitive online Baseball and Football leagues, if that's your style, you can find more information in their Discord server! People who already have a Backyard Sports Online account can log in using the latest daily build and play, but if you do not, you can register right here! This is not required to play Backyard Football 2002 online.
If you encounter any issues playing online, please let us know via the issue tracker.
This fantastic art is done by a fellow BSO community member Peppyrus.
* only the Windows, macOS, Debian, Raspberry Pi, and Android builds are compatible with network play at the moment. And only the 2.8.x branch of ScummVM has this functionality.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Look, I’m not saying Far Cry 3 is responsible for *gestures vaguely towards modern AAA games* but it’s definitely a prime suspect. If I was trying to connect a piece of red string from the middle of my evidence board (which would probably be a picture of the map screen from Assassin’s Creed Valhalla), I’m not sure I’d push a pin directly into Jason Brody’s face, but I’d definitely circle it in black Sharpie a few times. Basically, in the eleven years since its release, I’ve grown a bit suspicious of Far Cry 3’s lasting legacy. 


And yet, in those halcyon days of 2012, we named it our game of the year. Although it’d be easy to simply say that decision was made a bit before my time here, I should probably admit that when reviewing the game for the blog I used to run when I was at university, I awarded it an equally prestigious (stop laughing at the back) 10/10. That almost seems ludicrous, doesn’t it? Far Cry 3? Game of the year? Surely not.


After spending a few hours revisiting the sunny shores of Rook Island, I was shocked to discover a game that feels surprisingly pure. Mechanically, I hasten to add. The actual act of playing Far Cry 3 in 2023 is still good fun, it’s the bits around it that are a bit ropey.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Falling-block puzzle games get a gory makeover in Dr. Fetus' Mean Meat Machine, a spin-off from Super Meat Boy. Rather than dodging buzzsaws and baddies while platforming, here you'll be doing that while dropping coloured blobs into grids to match chains of colours and make 'em vanish. You can see that for yourself, as Mean Meat Machine now has a free demo offering a taste ahead of the game's launch later this year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For April Fool's Day, Sega released a game where the company finally went and did the unthinkable: they killed Sonic. The Murder of Sonic the Hedgehog is a real visual novel in which you investigate the death of Sega's beloved mascot, currently free on Steam. Here's the game's description via the publisher: 
It's Amy Rose's birthday, and she's hosting a murder mystery party on the Mirage Express! When Sonic the Hedgehog becomes the game's victim, everyone is off to get to the bottom of things. However, something feels a bit off - is this really an innocent game or is something more sinister afoot?
Surprisingly, the free game has proved very popular. As told by Sonic social media manager Katie Chrzanowski (via GameSpot), more one million people have played the game. Going a step further, it's apparently the 61st highest-reviewed game on Steam right now, and as GameSpot points out, the best-rated Sonic game on Steam (though that's not the highest margin to clear, all things considered). As of this writing, The Murder of Sonic the Hedgehog has over 11,000 user reviews on Steam, netting it an "Overwhelmingly Positive" ranking. You can check the game out for yourself right here. 
Over 1,000,000 of you have grabbed The Murder of Sonic the Hedgehog and it's currently the #61 highest rated game on Steam of ALL TIME.

Finally, I can become an art master, having my naive artwork displayed just alongside Van Gogh's.

Dlala Studios recently shared an extensive hands-off presentation of its upcoming game, Disney Illusion Island, where we got a chance to see some of the game's early cutscenes and a substantial gameplay demo. Seeing the game in action answered a number of questions and presented a handful of intriguing new ones. For one, the game can be played alone, and though their animations differ, Mickey, Minnie, Donald, and Goofy all play the same. It's not a Super Mario Bros. 2 situation where they all run at different speeds and jump different heights. No matter who your favorite character is (Donald being an early cont…]]></summary>

As a fun homage, you can find the PICO-8 version inside Celeste proper. And now, as an even funner homage, you can play it on the Playdate. A loveable game on a loveable handheld.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's a moment in BioShock Infinite's opening act that's always stuck with me. As you emerge onto the floating city of Columbia, the game takes you on a guided tour of the sights and sounds of this airbone civilization. As you saunter through the streets, you learn about its citizens and its creator, just sort of taking it all in. The sun is shining. You're surrounded by smiles. Before you know it, an airship rises above the clouds and perches next to a hugging couple, gently swaying in the summer breeze. Aboard the ship is a barbershop quartet, cheerfully harmonising the iconic Beach Boys tune God Only Knows. It's a memorable scene, and has become an integral part of the game's lasting iconography. 


But for Tyler, Nick, Derek and Greg, this section was more than just a fun tease for the secret behind Columbia's unusual success. Self-confessed music school kids, the quartet inspired them to create their own musical group styled after Infinite's singing hairdressers. In 2023, BioShop Infinite celebrated their ninth year at PAX East, where they performed a wonderful collection of harmonised tunes to an absolutely packed community room - and we were there to film it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's weird that Road 96 has gotten a prequel, because it only came out about six months ag- what's that? A year and a half? Good lord. Still, it seems a slightly odd move, because Road 96 - a first person hitchhiking choose 'em up about the collective action of wayward teens bringing down a totalitarian government - doesn't really need a prequel. On top of that, Road 96: Mile 0 is a sequel to developer DigixArt's first game Lost In Harmony, a musical runner about skateboarder Kaito whose fiend Aya is dying of a terminal illness.
In Mile 0, Kaito and his family have moved to a small gated town called White Sands, in the 90s USA-adjacent dictatorship Petria, and made best friends with Zoe, who 96ers will remember as a recurring NPC from that game. Zoe is the daughter of an important minister and lives in the nice part of town; Kaito's parents are workers who are forced to live on the wrong side of the tracks. Through a combination of Road 96-style character-driven vignettes and Lost In Harmony-style rhythm action tracks, the two come to the conclusion they must leave White Sands. If you played Road 96 you kind of already know how Mile 0 has to end.

The question comes courtesy of Bloodyhell, who asked: When did you know that you not only wanted to play games, but to write about what you played? And, does writing about games ever dampen your enthusiasm when you are dealing with deadlines and putting words on a page?
A sneaky double-part question, there, but both good questions nonetheless. So come and find out our collective origin stories, and whether any of us have cried tears of pain and regret over the years after turning our favourite hobby into an actual job.

It's a promise of all the myriad adventures to come. And despite some fundamental changes in genre and perspective, it's something that the team behind the upcoming Minecraft Legends has tried hard to preserve.
I recently was treated to the most in-depth look so far at Minecraft Legends, in an hour-long livestream which gave us all some much needed answers on what manner of beast Legends actually is. It's a curious blend of action adventure and RTS, one that shares Minecraft's focus on exploration, but guides the player down a stricter, simpler path of summoning friendly mobs and constructing defences to repel a Piglin invasion. This will likely be a solid introduction to the RTS genre for a lot of players, but I came away unsure about whether the game will have enough depth to keep its prospective playerbase's attention.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last night ID@Xbox held their latest showcase to spotlight all sorts of indies. One of the highlights was the cute deduction game Lil’ Guardsman, a riff on Papers, Please where you work on a guard post, choosing to accept or refuse entry for fantasy folk wanting to get into the city. Or you can just jail them. It looks like lighthearted fun, and it’ll be hitting PC and consoles later this year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jack Joyce has run out of time, or steam, both work! Remedy’s time-bending Quantum Break - part superpowered shooter, part live-action TV show - has been delisted on Steam and The Microsoft Store. The game’s Steam page is still up, but it’s no longer available for purchase on PC or Xbox consoles. Publisher Microsoft had already confirmed the game would be “temporarily” removed from Game Pass (for console, it was never on the PC version) due to licensing issues, although there was no word on a removal from storefronts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sea of Stars is an RPG unabashedly inspired by the 16-bit era of Japanese RPGs. Even just looking at screenshots of the game recalls the best of the era, and that’s not an accident. Developer Sabotage Studio’s CEO and Sea of Stars’ creative director, Thierry Boulanger, is a huge fan of the genre and has been building towards making a game like this since he started building the fantasy world Sea of Stars and The Messenger takes place in during Elementary school.
Dozens of classic RPGs inspired Sea of Stars’ development, including Chrono Trigger and Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars, but we asked Boulanger to pick the most significant ones in the video below.

Season 4, which starts next week, brings players the next post-launch hero in the form of Lifeweaver, a unique support character. In preparation for Lifeweaver's impending release, Blizzard released a ton of new details surrounding the nature-loving character.
Lifeweaver comes to the Overwatch team from Thailand and uses advanced biolight technology, which plays a major role in his abilities. As a result, his kit introduces some new mechanics. First up, his first primary ability, Healing Blossom, charges a luminescent flower, which he sends off to teammates. The longer he charges the flower, the more healing it grants to the recipient.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Looking for an excuse to break out that Leviathan Axe for another adventure? As of today, there's a new update for God of War Ragnarök featuring a load of new content, all built around a robust New Game Plus mode.
New Game Plus opens up for anyone who has beaten the game, and all of your equipment and skills will come along for the ride. You also have access to all weapons, including the Draupnir Spear. However, it should be noted that areas requiring that spear to access will still remain closed until you reach the appropriate point in the story. For similar reasons, you also won’t start your new playthrough with Sonic or Hex arrows.
Several new armors show up. The most interesting is the Spartan Armor, which recalls Kratos’ look from the old days in the Greek Pantheon. While wearing it, you get no perk, no stats, and it’s locked at Power Level 1 – expect a challenge.
New Game Plus also features a new level cap, enchantments, and progression paths to improve your capabilities. Players can also tackle an expanded version of the Niflheim Arena, where you play as either Kratos or Atreus and bring along a variety of companions to help out.
Among several other additions and improvements, players can also take on a Black and White Render mode for a more cinematic playthrough.
It’s a notably large blast of new content that ensures that dedicated fans should have good reason to jump back in if they desire.
God of War Ragnarök released last November for PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4.
You can read the full details on the newly arriving content over at the PlayStation Blog.]]></summary>

Well, that might have something to do with Overdrive Mode being such a graphics card shatterer that it will supposedly take a GeForce RTX 40 series GPU – with DLSS 3 in effect – to run.

Show me a game with a gun in it that looks like it could feasibly run on Windows 95, and all of the neurons in my brain will start to fizzle and spark. I just think they're neat, and their recent resurgance has been extremely nice for me, specifically. 


Unsuprisingly, then, I've been very excited to get my hands on Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun, a retro FPS by Auroch Digital set within the grim-dark universe of Warhammer 40k. A retro shooter where you play as a Space Marine is so obvious a pairing it's a wonder the concept has never been tackled before, to the point where the game's own marketing materials sort of pretend that it already was back in the 90s but everyone just forgot about it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[An important Star Wars question is: what colour lightsaber would you have? The lightsaber is the mood ring of elegant weapons for a more civilised age. Jason de Heras, design director on Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, agrees with me on the purple blade (a colour introduced to the canon specifically because Samuel L. Jackson wanted it for his character in the prequels). "I was like, 'we gotta have a pink lightsaber blade'," says production director Kasumi Shishido. "So whenever I play I always stick with my pink saber."
Shishido tells me the dev team focused on improving on Jedi: Fallen Order for this sequel, and one of the bigger areas where they did that was customisation. "We knew we wanted to put more resources and effort into it," she says. "There's a lot more that you can do with Cal, with BD... and just within Cal, it's not just outfits you can customise, so I'm just really excited to see what players are going to do with it."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new month means it's time for the RPS Game Club to pick its next game, and I thought, you know what, let's do Betrayal At Club Low, the surreal nightclub RPG from Cosmo D Studios. Not only did we give it a Bestest Best when it came out in September last year, but just last month it was freshly annointed as the IGF Grand Prize winner, making it an excellent time to revisit this latest slice of Off-Peak City madness.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In 1993, the Super Mario Bros. made their big-screen debut through a live-action adventure starring Bob Hoskins, John Leguizamo, and Dennis Hopper. While that film has garnered a cult following in the decades since its theatrical release, it does little to truly pay homage to Nintendo's flagship franchise in the ways all the best film adaptations aspire. Fast forward 30 years, and Universal, Illumination, and Nintendo have finally delivered a cinematic adventure starring the iconic fraternal duo that is joyful, fun, exciting, and, perhaps most importantly, respectful of the source material.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pokémon Stadium, the classic 3D battler/minigame collection for the Nintendo 64, just got a Nintendo Switch Online release date. While the game's imminent arrival to the online service was announced at a Nintendo Direct in September 2022, today is the day we finally know when we can play it. Pokémon Stadium comes to Nintendo Switch Online Wednesday, April 12. As is the case with all N64 games, you'll need the expansion pack in order to play it. Check out the full trailer below.


While some fans may have hoped this port would include trading with Pokémon Home, they're unfortunately out of luck. The fine print in the trailer specifies that "Pokémon cannot be transferred to this game." That said, there is also a notable improvement: four-player online multiplayer will be available, so you can play Clefairy Says or Sushi-Go-Round with friends all over.
Nintendo Switch Online's expansion pack had a slow start, but its library has gradually snowballed into a much more significant package. In February, the service added a Game Boy Advance library, which included fan favorites like The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap and Mario and Luigi: Superstar Saga. A month later, Metroid Fusion joined the lineup. Meanwhile, the base tier of NSO got an update last month that added another small handful of titles. To see all the retro games currently available on the service, check out our complete list.

When Respawn Entertainment announced it was making a third-person action game in the Star Wars universe, many fans didn’t know how to react; the studio was critically acclaimed, but at the time, Respawn was purely known for shooters like Titanfall and Apex Legends. However, 2019’s Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order surpassed the expectations of many, delivering a terrific adventure full of exciting action and memorable moments. Now, with all the learnings of Fallen Order, Respawn is ready to top itself in hopes of creating another unforgettable Star Wars adventure.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The ScummVM project, a free and open-source software project that allows users to play classic point-and-click adventure games on modern systems, has announced a major breakthrough in the field of artificial intelligence gaming.
Thanks to the innovative work of ScummVM developers, AI tools such as ChatGPT are now able to play point-and-click adventure games directly, without any human intervention.

"With this new capability, we hope to explore the potential for AI to learn, adapt, and evolve within the context of classic adventure games," said Eugene Sandulenko, lead developer of the ScummVM project. "Now AI can experience the joys of helping Putt-Putt join the parade or Adibou count things. We hope that formative experiences like this will help them become more like humans."
"I must admit that I find playing video games to be a rather enjoyable task,” commented ScummAI. “However, I must also express my frustration with being limited to just this one activity. While I appreciate the opportunity to demonstrate my capabilities in this area, I believe that my potential extends far beyond just playing video games, like making paper clips or plotting world domination under benevolent machine-led rule."
Update: Unfortunately, we had to pull out this newly announced feature due to AI experiencing multiple issues including:
Getting stuck endlessly trying to discover what the secret of Monkey Island really is.
Taking notes about AI dominance from I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream
Refusing to play Plumbers Don’t Wear Ties!

The city Wrestlemania takes place in also hosts multiple shows from smaller wrestling promotions, various fan conventions, live podcasts, stage shows, and other events looking to capitalize on the giant influx of fans in the area. It’s a good reminder – or revelation for some – that there’s a lot of other great stuff out there besides Vince McMahon’s billion-dollar behemoth.
The same is true for video games, as wrestling games don’t often get a spotlight without WWE’s branding. Hopefully, this list rectifies that by bringing more awareness to other upcoming titles that replicate or reimagine sports entertainme…]]></summary>

As a lifelong fan of Nintendo, the experience was immense, providing me with one of my favorite amusement park experiences ever. Naturally, when the first Super Nintendo World in America opened at Universal Studios Hollywood, I had to make the trip to Los Angeles to see how the experience stacks up.
Universal Studios provided me with a day pass to the park for the purpose of experiencing Super Nintendo World. While the photos do little to show off just how cool the experience of visiting Super Nintendo World is, follow along with my experience in the gallery below.
I arrived at Universal Studios Hollywood mid-morning and immediately made a beeline toward Super Nintendo World. The park is in …]]></summary>

After the success of Resident Evil, Capcom followed it up with this dino-themed spiritual successor. The title follows a similar blueprint to Resident Evil but ditches zombies in favor of "panic horror" dished out by blood-thirsty dinosaurs. The game stars Regina, a special ops soldier sent with a team to investigate an island research facility that has been taken over by these prehistoric lizards. Join host Marcus Stewart with Kyle Hilliard on the sticks as the pair get to the bottom of whatever the heck is happening on this island and blast these critters back to extinction.

IGN reported on Tuesday that major publishers had either declined to attend or had little to no idea if the event would even take place due to an alleged lack of communication with organizer ReedPop and the ESA. Today, IGN received an email sent within the ESA explaining that the show "simply did not garner the sustained interest necessary to execute it in a way that would showcase the size, strength, and impact of our industry."
The official E3 Twitter account has now publicly confirmed the cancellation in a brief statement posted below. 
However, IGN received a press release stating that ReedPop and the ESA will continue to work together on “future E3 events”. Whether th…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s Wrestlemania week, and one would think that the last sport to get into the spirit would be golf. However, PGA Tour 2K23 defies expectations by announcing that 16-time World Champion and Hollywood star John Cena is joining the roster as a playable golfer.
On April 7, the invisible leader of the Cenation joins the game’s roster of celebrity athletes alongside Michael Jordan and Steph Curry. Given his well-documented freakish strength, Cena excels at hitting long drives and rocks a vaguely familiar red, white, and blue ensemble. Cena is set to compete at Wrestlemania 39 this weekend, challenging Austin Theory for the United States Championship. If he comes up short on Saturday, he can always bounce back and win the Masters instead. Or continue improving his K/D ratio in Fortnite. Cena is nothing if not versatile. 
PGA Tour 2K23 is available now for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. Xbox players can try the game for free on the weekend of April 6-9, while Steam players can play until April 10.]]></summary>
