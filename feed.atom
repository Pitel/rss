Super Smash Bros. Ultimate might have wrapped up its development cycle, but there are still a number of other brawlers on the Nintendo Switch receiving regular updates. One of them happens to be the Ubisoft title Brawlhalla.

Ubisoft Forward kicked off its 'Ubisoft Forward' event this year with a "first look" at a quest in its upcoming Switch exclusive Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope.
As exciting as all of this was, the highlight of this segment was arguably the reveal of Rayman at the very end. During the show, game director Davide Soliani announced Rayman would be joining the game in the third DLC as a new playable hero, describing it as a "dream come true".

The exception is the Uncharted: Legacy Of Thieves Collection, which was confirmed for PC back in September 2021 but which still hasn't arrived.

It seems like that will change soon. A recent, hastily-removed update to the collection's Epic Games Store page declared that it would release on October 19th.

The September 2022 Ubisoft Forward was surprisingly filled with news, especially for Assassin's Creed fans. But even those who don't like to time-travel had something to see in Rabbids, BMX bikes, and mobile games.
Ubisoft laid out its short-term plans for several major franchises, before taking the back slice of the showcase to spotlight the big picture for Assassin's Creed. It's a pretty packed show, but we're here to run down all the headlines for you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Assassin's Creed franchise is getting its hub
Today, Ubisoft laid out the road ahead for the Assassin's Creed franchise. While it looks to a trip way back to Basim in Mirage, several other adventures are on the horizon, including a long-awaited jaunt to Feudal Japan.
During the Assassin's Creed showcase portion of today's Ubisoft Forward, the publisher confirmed its plans for Assassin's Creed Infinity. This AC Infinity will act as a hub of sorts for Assassin's Creed moving into the future, tying together all the different experiences and locales of Assassin's Creed.
Several studios are working on projects for it right now. And as reported earlier this week, one of them is Ubisoft Quebec, which is working on something fans have likely been waiting some time for: an Assassin's Creed spotlighting shinobi. Codename Red will see Assassin's Creed head to Feudal Japan, playing a shinobi character.
Also in the works is Codename Hexe, a project from Ubisoft Montreal with Watch Dogs: Legion creative director Clint Hocking on board. No more info was given on the stream, but reports have indicated this will head to the witch trials of the Holy Roman Empire.

An Infinity ahead
All of this is part of Ubisoft's plans for the Assassin's Creed Infinity hub, which may have even more in store. Alongside the two codename projects, Ubisoft's Marc-Alexis Côté confirmed that the publisher is looking into ways to incorporate standalone multiplayer into Assassin's Creed again.
With a mobile project, Netflix partnership, and more in store, seems like a lot of Assassin's Creed is in store for the coming years.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's "the last chapter"
More Assassin's Creed Valhalla DLC is in the cards beyond what we've already gotten, and it's appropriately called "The Last Chapter;" a free questline that "ties up the game."
In the brief trailer (which is more of a teaser, starting around 16:45 in the below showcase), Eivor notes that she's "done all that she can for her people," and says that it's "time to say goodbye, and set sail for distant shores and new adventures." And apparently she'll do just that in the DLC! The good news is that this DLC is free, and is being treated as a customary questline add-on. Eivor will "reunite with some key characters, including some influential historical ones."
If you haven't been following along, Assassin's Creed Valhalla was released in late 2020, and it's still trucking through the end of 2022. It hosted expansions titled Wrath of the Druids and The Siege of Paris, on top of the aforementioned free updates and quality of life upgrades. Like most Assassin's Creed games once the DLC stops flowing, it'll make for a pretty packed "GOTY/Complete" experience once everything is factored in. Ideally this "Last Chapter" actually ties up some loose ends and adds to the connective tissue of the series.

Assassin's Creed Mirage
This game was officially revealed last week following extensive leaks, and as expected, Ubisoft had a lot more to share about it during today's Ubisoft Forward showcase. Basim Ibn Ishaq, the master assassin from Assassin's Creed Valhalla, is taking the lead role this time, but he'll be much younger. This game follows his journey from a thief on the luscious and diverse streets of Golden Age Baghdad in 861 to an apprentice of the Hidden Ones to a master assassin.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As was leaked, and then hurriedly confirmed by Ubisoft about a week ago, the next Assassin's Creed game to come out will be Mirage, in 2023. It's not going to be quite the massive open world adventure 'em up that the last few entries have been (don't worry; one of those is on the way as well), but a more classic AssCreed experience to mark the series' 15th anniversary. This milestone has made me realise that the Creedsperience has taken up almost half of my current lifespan. Or, to put it another way, I fear that playing Assassin's Creed Mirage may induce a pathetic but very real existential crisis in me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A not-insignificant part of the Ubisoft Forward livestream tonight was dedicated to Assassin's Creed. To celebrate the doughty action-adventure's 15th anniversary, senior community developer Alice Terrett was joined by a, to his credit, very excited Danny "it's the Daddy" Wallace, to lay out an almost MCU-like timeline of every Assassin's Creed thing happening for the next good while. It includes new DLC for Valhalla, and a mysterious horror-ish tease. But top of the list, after next year's more trad and compact Assassin's Creed Mirage, is Assassin's Creed: Codename Red, the next big flagship open-world RPG for the series. And it's set in feudal Japan.

The suggestion that Assassin's Creed might become a live service online game akin to Fortnite was quite upsetting to me. Thankfully, VP executive producer on Assassin's Creed Marc-Alexis Côté (aka MAC) appeared on tonight's Ubisoft Forward livestream to explain more about Infinity, and I am slightly less alarmed but no less confused. Rather than a game, MAC says that Infinity is "going to be the single entry point for our fans into the Assassin's Creed franchise in the future".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following numerous leaks over the previous few weeks, Ubisoft officially revealed that Assassin's Creed Mirage is real. As expected, Ubisoft revealed a lot more about Mirage during today's Ubisoft Forward showcase, including the game's protagonist, setting, and more. 
If you've been paying attention to leaks and rumors, you likely already had a good idea of what Mirage will be, doubly so after today's presentation. Basim Ibn Ishaq, the master assassin from Assassin's Creed Valhalla, is in the lead role this time around. However, he's not the polished warrior you might remember him as because Mirage takes place years before Valhalla. In this game, he's a young thief, and his playground is the luscious and diverse streets of Baghdad, Iraq. Set in 861, a period when Baghdad was the epicenter …]]></summary>

Assassin's Creed China is going to be entering the mobile mix "soon," thanks to a new reveal from the Ubisoft Forward stream today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SS_khJE0mbQ&list=PLBnrd5k2F2INdjLweJqlvK0OCRIJPg_O2&index=33&t=1048s
Expanding on the quick dip into China seven years ago, this one is a fully-fledged Assassin's Creed game for mobile platforms. According to Ubisoft, it'll sport "all the iconic Assassin's Creed gameplay, with mobile controls." The exact date given for the timeline is 215 BCE, and in the teaser we see an aerial view of the new open world playground: and a closeup of the upcoming protagonist. However, said protagonist is actually "fully customizable."
All we have to go on right now, beyond the short teaser, is that it's called "Codename Jade." This was one of three codenames given out for future entries, which will deal with feudal Japan and (based on leaks) the Holy Roman Empire, and the witch trials therein. So to sum everything up today, three new Assassins' Creed games were announced, with a look at the already-confirmed Mirage. So uh, this series isn't taking a break anytime soon.
If you want to skip to the Codename Jade footage, that starts at roughly 20:45 into the above video.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Head back to the ninth century with Basim
The next Assassin's Creed heads way, way back in time. Assassin's Creed Mirage will spotlight the assassin Basim, and arrive sometime in 2023.
Assassin's Creed Mirage is set 20 years before the events of Assassin's Creed Valhalla, where we first met Basim. It will explore ninth century CE Baghdad, as the young orphan dives into the world of the Hidden Ones. And yes, that includes cutting a finger off.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x55lAlFtXmw
The reveal comes after several reports and rumors about the game. Ubisoft confirmed its existence prior to today's showcase, teasing more to come in the reveal trailer.
Guiding Basim in his training is Roshan, voiced by Shohreh Aghdashloo. Here's the story rundown from the trailer:
In Assassin’s Creed Mirage, you are Basim, a cunning street thief with nightmarish visions, seeking answers and justice. After an act of deadly retribution, Basim flees Baghdad and joins an ancient organization – The Hidden Ones. As he learns their mysterious rituals and powerful tenets, he will hone his unique abilities, discover his true nature, and come to understand a new Creed – one that will change his fate in ways he never could have imagined.

No firm date has been set yet, outside of 2023. But with some excellent voice talent already on-hand and a focus on narrative adventure, this seems pretty interesting for longtime Assassin's Creed fans. Meanwhile, Ubisoft did reveal a collector's edition for Assassin's Creed Mirage.

If you want more to check out, Ubisoft also posted a developer breakdown of its reveal trailer on YouTube.

Today, we learned that Netflix subscribers will have exclusive access to three upcoming Ubisoft mobile games as a part of their existing memberships, with no ads or microtransactions. This announcement comes as Netflix prepares to enter the gaming space with its first releases later this year.
First up, is a sequel to Valiant Hearts, a World War I puzzle-adventure. This new title is in development by the team behind the first game and will bring a new story exclusively to Netflix members in January 2023. That same year, a sequel to Mighty Quest, the roguelite hack and slash, will arrive for subscribers. Finally, Ubisoft is currently working on a new, original Assassin's Creed mobile title, which, again, will be available exclusively to Netflix subscribers.
In addition to the Assassin's Creed live-action series, Ubisoft and Netflix are currently collaborating on three animated series: Captain Laserhawk: Blood Dragon Remix, Far Cry, and Splinter Cell. While Netflix is set to enter the games industry later this year, we'll have to wait until at least next year to experience these three new mobile titles for Netflix subscribers.]]></summary>

Ubisoft is teaming up with Netflix for several new collaborations. Three mobile Ubisoft games are coming to the streaming service's gaming section, as well as a live-action Assassin's Creed.
Announced during today's Ubisoft Forward, Ubisoft is bringing three games to Netflix. The first is a sequel to Valiant Hearts, its animated war story game from 2014, made by the original team.

A follow-up to The Mighty Quest for Epic Loot is also on the way. Both of these games are set to launch in 2023, with Valiant Hearts arriving in January and the Mighty Quest follow-up set for sometime in 2023.
The third project is an original mobile Assassin's Creed experience. All these games will be exclusive to Netflix users, who can access them via the Netflix app.
Alongside the mobile games, a live-action Assassin's Creed series is in the works at Netflix. We've known this has been in development, alongside several animated Ubisoft property adaptations. Even Sam Fisher is getting an animated series on Netflix.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Cloud, too
A Trackmania console release is slated for "early 2023," according to an announcement made in an Ubisoft Forward stream today.
The window given right now is "early 2023," and PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, Stadia, and Luna were specifically mentioned in the reveal (as were "cloud platforms"). Cross-play and cross-progression are confirmed ahead of time too, which is a nice surprise that doesn't require us to dig into a hidden FAQ to figure out if that's actually planned or not.
In case you forgot, Trackmania is the shortened title for the 2020 rendition of the series, which launched as a free-to-play game. As of today, a yearly "club level" subscription costs $29.99, which has still earned the ire of many prospective players. As Ubisoft puts it, you can: "Enhance your experience with Standard Access and unleash your creativity. Play solo or multiplayer on seasonal campaigns and keep track of your progression with medal collection, trophies, and regional and worldwide rankings."
The combination of only being available on PC and the subscription model has squarely put Trackmania 2020 in the "maybe" column since launch. At this point, quickly being able to boot it up on a console could sway me to give it another shot.

Yesterday we received our first looks at an unnamed Marvel game, a new Tron title, and Mickey Mouse and crew teaming up in a platformer. Today, Marvel and Lucasfilm unloaded a flurry of announcements and trailers for projects hitting in 2022 and beyond.
On the Marvel Cinematic Universe front, we learned Fantastic Four will be directed by Matt Shakman, who worked on Wandavision and It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia. Dominique Thorne's Ironheart will take on the villain The Hood (brought to life by Anthony Ramos) in the Ironheart Disney Plus series. Sam Wilson's first mission as Captain America in New World Order will be against The Leader, with Tim Blake reprising this role 14 years after 2008's The Incredible Hulk.
We also learned who the Thunderbolts are in the forthcoming film. The team consists of anti-heroes Yelena Belova (Florence Pugh), Taskmaster (Olga Kurylenko), Valentina (Julia Louis-Dreyfus), Red Guardian (David Harbour), U.S. Agent (Wyatt Russell), Ghost (Hannah John-Kamen, and Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan).
Marvel also treated us to our first looks at Secret Invasion, starring Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury and Emilia Clarke in an unknown role. And in just one month, we can watch the classicly designed horror film Werewolf by Night on Disney Plus. You can see both trailers below.
The Star Wars news is a bit lighter, consisting of our first look at The Mandalorian's third season, which looks absolutely bonkers in the best way. We also got a glimpse of the animated anthology Tales of the Jedi, hitting on October 26. The Bad Batch's second season hits on January 4, yet no new footage was shown. Andor also received a new trailer for the first season hitting in 11 days. The second season's filming is already underway! Again, you can see all of the Star Wars trailers below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We have some actual gameplay now
The Division Heartland was shown off today at the September 2022 Ubisoft Forward stream, which is still moving forward as a free-to-play Division game.
Described as focusing on "streamlined gameplay," you'll be defending "middle-America" with new characters and stories: "Tom Clancy’s The Division Heartland is a free-to-play survival-action multiplayer shooter set in a rural community in mid-crisis. Explore a hostile environment as you fight alongside and against other trained agents and uncover the mysteries of Silver Creek.". You can get a look at gameplay below. As a reminder, it's arriving on PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X in the future.

Oh, and in case you forgot, there's another Division game in the works: Tom Clancy's The Division Resurgence. Here's how it works: "Explore a highly contaminated area of New York City, fight NPCs to get high-rarity loot and get to the extraction point to save it to your inventory. But beware of other players. Agents can go Rogue at any moment and decide to stab you in the back to steal your stuff, even your own teammates." That's also free-to-play, and coming to mobile devices (iOS and Android) with a closed beta coming this fall.

Ubisoft also confirmed that work has begun on Year 5 of The Division 2 proper (beyond the upcoming seasonal shifts happening later this year), so that game is still alive for the time being.

Ubisoft decided to open up their September 2022 Ubisoft Forward stream with Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope gameplay: seven minutes of it, to be exact.
The demo starts off in an overworld, showing off NPC interaction, light puzzles, and exploration. The team has a clear objective: get to the Wiggler train: which then triggers a boss battle with an enraged Wiggler. Light footage of Sparks was shown: equipment that can grant elemental damage, battlefield control, and enable abilities. Here's the demo description from Ubisoft: "Here comes the Wiggler! Join us in guiding you through a quick look at some gameplay and a new planet in one of the many exciting quests and dynamic battles that await you in Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope. Optimise, strategise, and remember to get help from the Sparks!"
The Ubisoft stream presenter said that it's "too early to reveal all the post-launch plans," but there was some info provided today. There's going to be "free DLC drops," the third of which will feature a new character. It's none other than Rayman! There will be Rayman DLC, described as a "new DLC adventure with the Rabbids."
We also got a look at the pre-order bonus called the Megabug Collection.

Summer may be over, but that doesn't mean that the publishers of the planet aren't still eager to bombard us with video presentations packed full of updates on their incoming wares — This afternoon sees the turn of French studio Ubisoft, who takes to the stage for another Ubisoft Forward live stream.
Ubisoft Forward 2022 is expected to focus mostly on one of the studio's flagship franchises, Assassin's Creed, with reveals and trailers for the recently leaked Assassin's Creed Mirage and, if rumors are to be believed, further titles from the historical stealth series. In addition, Ubisoft has announced that it will be providing new updates on the super-silly adventure title Mario + Rabbids: Sparks of Hope and the seafaring, open-world pirate epic Skull and Bones.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvV4ZBx6_bo
These are only the tip of the iceberg, as Ubisoft is currently beavering away with many other projects. These include the delayed Prince of Persia remake, the M.I.A. Beyond Good and Evil sequel, a Splinter Cell remake, the cinematic epic Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora. and the as-yet-untitled Star Wars title, so it will be interesting to see what Ubisoft brings to the table over the course of the 60-minute stream.
Ubisoft Forward will kick off one hour from now, at 12:00 PT/ 15:00 ET/ 20:00 BST. A pre-show will begin in 30 minutes' time, for those of you who can't get enough Ubisoft on a Saturday afternoon. Of course, we will bring you all of the top headlines right here on Destructoid, but if you'd like to chat among your fellow community members in the comments, then you are, of course, most welcome.

Snap on the spandex and comb that mullet, as it's time to step back in the 1980s heyday of professional wrestling, as Hamster adds Taito's old-school ring-rocker Champion Wrestler to the Arcade Archives on Nintendo Switch and PS4.
Hitting the arcade scene in 1989 — at the height of both Hulkamania and pro wrasslin's first international boom — Champion Wrestler lacks any official licensing from any real-life promotions, but makes a strong effort to capture the excitement, color, and flamboyance of the pseudo-sport as depicted during this golden era. Players can choose from a selection of suspiciously familiar characters with rad names like Matterhorn Decker, The Samurai, Miracle Rastan, and Jimmy Carbon, before battling it out in one-on-one, tag team, and even cage match action.
Check out the action in the video below, courtesy of YouTuber Janet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JR1wU0SfGI
Champion Wrestler is certainly a weird one. The game boasts a selection of nice moves, some fun sprite art, and cool touches such as ring entrances and cheating managers. To play, however, it's a little odd, with the player required to walk around in order to build up power for some of their better throws and holds. Still, all of these flaws fall away at the end of each match, as bizarre wrestler portraits show the winner hanging in casinos, appearing on TV shows, and living in luxury, while the loser is carted off to hospital, quits the business to sell hot dogs, or even turns to a life of crime! A silly but fun touch.
Champion Wrestler would eventually be ported to PC Engine in Japan, and would also make an appearance as a Virtual Console title for Nintendo Wii. If you fancy stepping into the ring with this odd release, then it is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at around $8.

I have little qualm in admitting that my week was weighed down by a particularly powerful bout of depression, the worst in many, many years. And, (because when it rains, it pours), I also dealt with a hospital visit, some work strife, a couple of ugly encounters, and a bathroom flood, the latter of which actually led to me breaking my glasses.

Yesterday, during the Disney & Marvel Games Showcase, we learned this ensemble wasn't Fantastic Four, Avengers, or any known Marvel team whatsoever. Skydance is creating its own team of four heroes, set to the backdrop of World War II.

When discussing video gaming’s propensity towards violence, I often say, “ballistics are easy, discussion is difficult.” Simulating the path of a bullet has been part of the video game landscape for almost as long as it has existed. However, we still struggle with creating meaningful communication. We don’t often argue with the end boss, they’re usually not in a talking mood.
I’m always intrigued to see games make an attempt at simulating discussions. At the bottom rung, a game will have you pour stat points into charisma and maybe pair it with a dice roll. You only sometimes get games like Alpha Protocol, which has a smidge more nuance. You have to read the room to figure out how to shmooze your target (into bed, hopefully).

Splashteam, developer of the humourous 2D platformer Splasher, is back again but with a different cast of curious creatures in its newest project, Tinykin. It's an imaginative and very pleasant 3D platformer that challenges you to think outside the box and find a new purpose in everyday objects — especially since they'll be the only thing to help you escape the '90s house you've found yourself in. But it's okay, you're not alone; Tinykin is filled to the brim with intriguing NPCs to guide the way.
You take on the role of Milodane, an explorer and astronaut who finds himself in a cluttered house on planet Earth, but this house has an unusual atmosphere, and there are no humans. Instead, each room is infested with an array of talkative insects who quickly request Milo's help for the rewards of something we see as a mundane household object, but to Milo, they are the key to repairing his ship and finally heading home.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Summer is ebbing away, and I hate how it goes. I already miss long evenings, with sunset now before 8pm but sunrise still pointlessly at like 6:30? No thanks. I don't miss those 5am sunrises either. So we can surely all agree that the sensible course of action would be to lock sunrise to 7:30am and rotate the whole clock around that. Anyway! What are you playing this weekend? Here's what we're clicking on.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Date and systems not yet announced.
Perhaps one of the biggest surprises at the Disney and Marvel Games Showcase was the news of a Gargoyles remaster.
If you're not familiar with this game, it is a 2D platformer developed by Disney Software and released on the Sega Genesis in 1995. It's based on Disney's 90s animated series at the time, and players take control of Goliath, who sets out to put a stop to the Eye of Odin and the antagonist Demona.

Hello hello! Tonight we're taking the role of a defense lawyer who must investigate crimes and defend our clients in court. Self-described as "potentially the hottest bird lawyering game to come out of 1840s France," Aviary Attorney is clearly a very Ace Attorney-flavored game, which we all know as iconic and tons of fun. There are three possible endings, all "drastically different," casting a new light on the main characters as they discover what justice means. I'm really looking forward to the cool art style and witty dialogue.

Come check it out with me!
Drop by Destructoid’s Twitch channel at 9:00 p.m. Eastern to hang out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Warm up those winter fingers
NIS America has announced a release date for the western localization of flashy shmup revisit Raiden IV x MIKADO Remix — The highly adrenalized blaster will launch in North America on January 31, 2023, with Europe to follow a couple of days later on February 3.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaqpdPb7B3o
As previously reported, Raiden IV x MIKADO Remix is a remaster of the classic 2007 arcade blaster Raiden IV. The new edition has been bolstered with a huge variety of new features including two-player couch co-op, a selection of filters and orientation options, and a full suite of modes including Arcade, Practice, Boss Rush, and Overkill modes. The centerpiece of the remaster is a fully remixed and re-recorded score, composed and performed by artists from the Game Center Mikado collective.
Already available on Nintendo Switch, the new port will arrive on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms, and is the first in what is expected to be a full range of "x MIKADO" titles, that will revitalize arcade classics with opulent, beautifully composed scores from some of Japan's most talented gaming composers. Given the long-held love affair between shmups and frenetic, pulse-pounding beats, starting out with the legendary Raiden IV was certainly something of a no-brainer.
Raiden IV x MIKADO Remix launches in the west on PC and consoles January 31.

In line with prior distribution events to celebrate Ash's party in the Pokemon TV series, Ash's Sirfetch'd is now live.
The news was announced on Twitter, which once again broadcasted the code on TV Tokyo in Japan on September 9. Remember, Ash's Gengar is available until September 15, so you can get a few free Pokemon while you're at it. The entire team that this event is celebrating includes: Dracovish, Dragonite, Gengar, Sirfetch'd, and Lucario. All you need to do is load up the mystery gift screen and enter the code below (if you have your copy of the game but haven't started it yet, you'll need to spend a short while with the intro to unlock the mystery gift functionality).
All of these distribution events noted here apply solely to Pokemon Sword and Shield, as we start to enter the new generation of the series in just a few months. While there's been a handful of other games since then, it'll be easy enough to get all of these free creatures in a box somewhere and ship them off to Scarlet and Violet whenever the bank service is available.

Today, Disney and Marvel aired its first-ever games showcase. The duo spotlighted a bunch of games, both upcoming and out right now, coming to a bunch of systems. Even Avatar snuck in there.
The showcase covered a bunch of stuff, so we're here to help break it all down. Everything ranging from a teaser for Skydance New Media's still-untitled Marvel project, to some new Disney Dreamlight Valley residents.

Bithell Games opened the show with a short teaser for its Tron project, Tron Identity. A quick jaunt over to its Steam page shows it's a visual novel adventure set in the digitized world of Tron, which sounds pretty awesome, actually.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It fits
The Sonic Frontiers main theme is out, and like its title, it makes a statement: "I'm Here." Ahead of launch we've gotten a look at the ending song, and now it's the main theme's time to shine.
Tomoya Ohtani, composer for the series, stepped in on Twitter to intro the song and gave the following context for it: "Finally we have released the main theme for the game! How did it make you feel? The Arrangement manages to showcase the multiple emotions of Sonic Frontiers."
"Emotions" is definitely a vibe the team has been going for since Sonic Adventure, and this song hearkens back to the bygone era of the late '90s/early aughts. It's hard to believe this new era of 3D Sonic basically started in 1999, and it's still carrying on today.
As for the song, I think it fits. It's not my favorite (I'm way more into the Frontiers ending song, and more into ONE OK ROCK in general), but if the team was going for an old school vibe, I think they accomplished that goal. You can listen to it yourself below and make your own call.
In case you're curious, Sega has provided the full personnel list for the Sonic Frontiers main theme song:
Vocals & Lyrics by Merry Kirk-Holmes (To Octavia)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During today's Disney & Marvel Games Showcase at the D23 Expo, we got a look at the first game from Skydance New Media. While we didn't get a name or release date, we did get a cinematic trailer from which we can try to extract information. The biggest news right out of the gate is that this game stars Black Panther, Captain America, and two additional heroes.
This new triple-A game takes place during World War II. As the camera pans over a table covered with things like a brochure for Paris and a flyer for a jazz performance, the items quickly take a turn for the insidious with things like a dagger, a pistol, documents, a hat featuring the Hydra insignia, and, finally, Captain America's iconic shield scratched by what appears to be claws.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Do a wall-jump, Mickey
Mickey, Minnie, Donald, and Goofy are setting off on a new adventure for the Nintendo Switch. Disney Illusion Island is a new co-op platformer for Nintendo Switch, starring the Disney pals and arriving sometime in 2023.
Revealed during the Disney and Marvel Games Showcase as part of D23 Expo, Disney Illusion Island looks to be a 2D platformer where players can opt to play as Mickey, Minnie, Donald, or Goofy.
The art style is the same as the current run of Mickey's animated offerings. But the gameplay seems similar to something like New Super Mario Bros., in the way it has four players navigating the screen together.
Here's the trailer:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM_PCKwC484
The plot seems to follow the Disney pals helping out a group of adorable furballs who need some help. The team will need to unlock special abilities, solve puzzles, and take on bosses to save the island of Monoth. By retrieving all the books from all the biomes, they can save the day. And maybe run into some cartoon-y hijinks along the way.

Co-op platforming adventures
Disney Illusion Island is in development at Dlala Studios, whose previous work includes the 2020 Battletoads reboot. Although that got some mixed reception, I'm actually pretty interested in Disney Illusion Island.
The newer art style of Mickey, Minnie, and the gang has grown on me. Though that's probably due in part to some clips making the rounds on social media.
And a chill, family-friendly co-op platformer seems like a decent time too. I could see this being an obvious pick-up for Switch owners with one kids.
As it is now, we'll see more of what Disney and Dlala have in store sometime in the future. Disney Illusion Island is set for Nintendo Switch in 2023.

Unfortunately, the reveal didn’t come alongside a trailer, a list of platforms, or a release window. However, it sounds like we should expect a similar treatment that the Disney Classics Games Collection received. Those games were enhanced with high-res graphics, a rewind ability, a level skip, and art galleries showcasing concept sketches and other historical goodies.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Niantic is back with Marvel's World of Heroes
Who could forget Pokémon GO? It still continues to do well to this day, but nothing will compare to that first summer where it took the world by storm. The game's developer, Niantic, has had a few projects since, and now they've newly announced a collaboration with Marvel to create a game titled World of Heroes.
 
The project was revealed today during the Disney x Marvel Games Showcase stream, and all we know so far is that it's coming sometime in 2023. The trailer did include a website where players can go to pre-register, which will likely be up within the next day.

Like I said, the announcement (which I wouldn't even call a trailer because it was so short, to be honest) was pretty slim, but based on what we know of Niantic's games from the past, I think we can take a pretty educated guess as to what the gameplay will be like. I imagine you get to play as different heroes from the Marvel canon, as evidenced by the people in the trailer wielding the iconic weapons of characters like Thor and Doctor Strange.
From there, I could imagine there being bases you could visit in the real world, like the PokéStops in Pokémon GO, powerful items that you can find laying around the world, and I'm sure you'll be able to battle other players, of course. At this point it's pure speculation, so we'll have to see when the game finally drops... whenever that will be.

Today, we got a brief glimpse at what Skydance New Media is working on for Marvel. The project is still untitled, but looks to involve both Black Panther and Captain America in the studio's Marvel game.
The project doesn't have an official title right now, and was referred to as "Marvel | Skydance New Media Project" during the showcase.
While we didn't get a title, what we did see was confirmation of reports that this game would feature both Captain America and Black Panther. Here's the teaser:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2f5JMCX1-7I
We can catch some glimpses of Black Panther, as well as some claw marks on the shield. We see both Paris and Wakanda as well, and likely some more visual teasers surrounding HYDRA that fans will probably piece together.
With the tag "four heroes, two worlds, one war," it will be interesting to see what this team puts together.
We'll meet again, don't know where, don't know when
Skydance New Media is the studio led by Uncharted co-creator Amy Hennig and former Electronic Arts dev Julian Beak. The developer revealed it was working on a new Marvel game last year, describing it as a narrative-driven action-adventure game.
Hennig and co. are also working on a new Star Wars game, which will also be an action-adventure affair.
Both Captain America and Black Panther seem like excellent picks for an action-adventure title, and a crossover between the two could go some interesting places. We don't have much to pull out of today's announcement, but hopefully we'll get some more details soon on Skydance New Media and Marvel's project.

One upcoming release that Marvel fans have been looking forward to is Midnight Suns, an upcoming tactical RPG by Firaxis Games, a veteran studio best known for creating the Civilization series. A new trailer for the game during the Disney x Marvel Games Showcase today gave us a new glimpse of what we have to look forward to, as well as finally giving us a release date for later this year. You can play as classic characters like Doctor Strange and Spider-Man, while the game will also introduce a whole host of new or lesser known characters.
The game's intro was revealed in a video you can watch below: and the Doctor Strange Defenders skin was announced as a pre-order bonus for all platforms.

In addition to the new release date, it was also announced that the game's creators will be releasing a series of prequel animated shorts that give us a better look into who these characters are within the world of Midnight Suns. The shorts will premiere on October 31, making Halloween even more exciting this year. Here's the rundown on those:
"Marvel's Midnight Suns Prequel Shorts is a set of five short videos that provide backstory on how Lilith became the Mother of Demons, and how Super Heroes like Blade, Magik, Ghost Rider and Nico Minoru came together to form the young core of the Midnight Suns."

Marvel's Midnight Suns will officially be out on December 2, 2022 for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.

Nuverse and Second Dinner are bringing the heroes and villains of Marvel to the card arena next month. Digital card battler Marvel Snap hits PC and mobile on October 18.
Announced today during the Disney and Marvel Games Showcase at D23 Expo, the free-to-play card game will feature over 150 cards at launch and more than 80 different locales for digital dueling.
Marvel Snap is being developed by Second Dinner, a studio founded by several former Hearthstone developers. In its reveal back in May, the team assured that while Marvel Snap is free-to-play, every card will be available through gameplay.
Probably shouldn't let Thanos play Snap
One of the key mechanics in Marvel Snap is the titular "snap" move, allowing players to effectively double-down. It's a bluffing mechanic that reminds me a lot of Gwent, and could add an interesting dynamic to play.
Second Dinner is also advertising fast play sessions, at just three minutes a pop. Seems like the idea is to pick up and play quickly.
Considering the way Hearthstone dominated the digital card landscape so fast, I'm interested to see what this team puts together. With the whole Marvel universe behind it for fodder, the team certainly won't lack for interesting characters to toss in. Fingers crossed for some Squirrel Girl.
If you want to keep up with the game and be ready to grab when it's live, you can pre-register over on the Marvel Snap site here.
Marvel Snap debuts for mobile and PC on October 18.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From Mike Bithell
Tron Identity was confirmed during today's D23 Expo Disney and Marvel Games Showcase: and will be arriving in 2023 from Bithell Games.
Thankfully, the "wishlist on Steam" tease came through, and it's live there now! Here's the full description:
"In a new Grid, forgotten by its creator and left alone to evolve without User intervention, an unprecedented crime has been committed. The Repository stands at the center of this society. In the aftermath of a break-in, the future of this Grid hangs in the balance. TRON: Identity is a visual novel adventure following Query, a detective program tasked with uncovering the mystery of what was taken and by whom. Finding yourself in a world built on unstable foundations and filled with whispered knowledge, it’s up to you to question suspects and investigate your surroundings to piece together the truth.
The decisions you make will actively influence the story, with a multitude of possible outcomes, good and bad – all depending on your carefully chosen words. You’ll interact with a number of intriguing characters, and decide whether to ally with them, spurn them, or even derezz them. However you choose to deal with them, you’ll need to recover their lost memories in your search for answers, puzzling your way through defragging Identity Discs. The world of TRON is growing, and your adventure is the seed."

The game boasts an original story as a "new extension of the Tron franchise," which is great news as Disney really isn't doing anything with it at the moment. I'm cautiously optimistic, but it's become an increasingly safe bet to trust Mike Bithell.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Disney and DLaLa Studios have revealed Disney's Illusion Island, a 2D platformer starring Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Donald, and of course, Goofy. 
Revealed during today's Disney and Marvel Games Showcase, Illusion Island looks a lot like Disney's Mickey Mouse show that consists of various shorts starring original Disney characters like, well, Mickey and all of his friends. 


It seems that in Illusion Island, we'll be controlling Mickey, Minnie, Donald, and Goofy based on what obstacles might be in our way. Mickey, for example, seems to be able to bounce off of walls, whereas Minnie has a grapple hook-like rope useful for clearing large gaps. Donald can swim – duh – and Goofy uses condiments (it kind of looked like mustard, but it might also be paint) to float and bounce above the stage below. 

All of it looks like good fun, but it's not all smiles and happiness on Illusion Island. That's because our heroes must endure three trials to retrieve the coveted Book of Knowledge. We'll learn exactly what those trials are when Disney's Illusion Island hits Switch exclusively next year.]]></summary>

While Q-Games is best known for the PixelJunk series, the studio's otherworldly resource-gathering, town-rebuilding, kaiju-stopping game The Tomorrow Children left a mark. Assuming, of course, that you were around to catch lightning in a bottle back in 2016.
With an online shared-world foundation, this peculiar social action-adventure game let players roll into town to pitch in with exploration, hauling, building, and a lot of odd jobs — manual labor was kind of the whole point in this Soviet-themed "alternate future."
Every task felt slow, methodical, and deliberate. But all the tedium ultimately paid off when folks worked together long enough to accomplish bigger goals. The Tomorrow Children was an entirely communal game, leading to memorable player experiences (and …]]></summary>

In the shadow of a new trailer, it's time for a Pokemon Scarlet and Violet reveals update, with three more creatures on the docket.
Starting at the beginning, we had the announcement of Sprigatito, Fuecoco, and Quaxly, which have all been welcomed by the community; in addition to the ridable legendaries. All five of these characters are being immortalized on an OLED Switch, too. Early on Lechonk really took off, and most recently Armarouge and Ceruledge have been seeing a lot of praise, especially from Mega Man fans. A few readers even noted that they could make a great Smash Bros. dual character one day (great idea!).
In any case, it looks like a good spread so far, and you can see all the new Scarlet and Violet additions in one place below. I think I can vibe with pretty much everyone so far? Though I have to admit, my usual grass starter plan is a little mixed up with Fuecoco in the running.
Nintendo has a running list here on the official site, if you want to dig into info on any specific creature.

CD Projekt Red updated Cyberpunk 2077 with patch 1.6 this week, adding crossover content and a host of fixes. But a tool was also tucked into the patch: official mod tools for Cyberpunk 2077.
In patch 1.6 (via Eurogamer), REDmod is set of new modding tools for CD Projekt Red's open-world RPG. It's a free DLC that adds "integrated upport for installing and loading mods" into Cyberpunk 2077.
The REDmod also adds new modding tools which can be used specifically for Cyberpunk 2077. These tools can be used to create things within the world of Cyberpunk, ranging from custom sounds and animations to scripts. CD Projekt Red says it will keep REDmod continuously updated alongside game patches, to ensure compatibility.

Making a mod
If you've been following the PC scene for Cyberpunk 2077, you're probably already aware of some pretty good mods out there. I'm personally a big fan of the one that makes the metro a real, rideable metro. Future trains are cool!
So how does this work with CD Projekt's modding tools? Well, NexusMods has a helpful page dedicated to this exact situation.
New mods will require a specific format to be compatible with the REDmod application going forward. Cyberpunk 2077 will still support loading old mods from the archive folder, but they will not appear in the REDmod menu.
For users, NexusMods says the most crucial thing to know is that old mods still work. And for authors, there is documentation on the Cyberpunk website for the new tools.
I'm interested to see how modders receive this, and what they're able to do with the new tools. That said, more mod support is hopefully a good thing. As much as CD Projekt Red can do in supporting the game short-term, we've seen what mods can do for games like Skyrim.

Remember all the furore over Nier: Automata’s supposed secret church? Well, now you too can play the greatest trick the Internet ever pulled on people who enjoy Yoko Taro games a bit too much. SadFutago’s The Nier: Automata Church mod is finally ready to download from NexusMods.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Despite lamenting the other week that the rest of 2022's gaming calendar was looking a bit weak sauce after endless delay announcements, September is shaping up to be an absolutely monster month for indie releases right now. As Alice Bee noted earlier in the week, there are just too many cool, interesting games coming out for us to review effectively on the site at the moment (although rest assured, we will do our darnedest to cover as many of them as we can).
Part of the challenge is working out what's worth reviewing, and what we think is worth highlighting for you, our readers. The other part, though, is often entirely selfish on our part, just playing and writing about cool games we like. In fact, the decision to review many of the games we covered this week - Railbound, Jack Move and Roadwarden - were all down to having played and liked some form of demo, making events like the Steam Next Fest an increasingly invaluable tool in helping us cut through the noise when we inevitably enter mega months like September.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Insert obligatory Nietzshe quote here.
Made in Abyss feels like an anime/manga ripe for a game adaptation, especially given its almost Happy Tree Friends-esque combination of cute visuals with incredibly disturbing violence. We finally got that adaptation in the laboriously named Made in Abyss: Binary Star Falling into Darkness, which manages to be quite a mixed bag. There are very good reasons to pick this game up and there are equally good reasons to pass on it; whether or not it’s worth your time will likely depend on how much of a fan you are of the series.
The narrative in Made in Abyss closely adheres to the premise of the series, which is set in a society built around an enormous abyss in the middle of the ocean. Nobody knows exactly how deep the abyss goes or what awaits at the bottom, but all sorts of powerful artifacts and riches have been found within on expeditions, which makes ‘Cave Raider’ one of the most coveted and respected professions around.

Publisher Rogue Games, which has launched Switch games such as Fisti-Fluffs and Super Mega Zero, has announced that it will be moving to a four-day work week, with employees set to have every Friday off with no additional hours added to prior work days.
The news comes via Game Developer, who interviewed Rogue Games' CEO Matt Casamassina (previously co-founder of IGN) on the huge change which comes in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Casamassina states that in the years following his time at IGN, he has tried to work "smarter, not necessarily harder", and this mentality is part of what drove the decision to change the work week at Rogue Games.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[But for how long?
If there's one thing that's defined the most recent console generation, it's shortages. Shortages of semiconductors, parts, and other components, have led to a shortage in stock for both the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series consoles and have also affected Switch production. But we seem to have hit a turnaround if August's monthly charts from GfK are anything to go by. (Thanks, Gameindustry.biz.)
In the UK, console sales for all three major manufacturers rose in August, but Sony's big white tower has seen the biggest increase (a 56% stock increase), and as a result, it has now become the best-selling console in the UK in 2022. If you've been keeping an eye on the weekly game charts, then you'll know that Horizon Forbidden West has been doing particularly well, and that's because of a PS5 bundle — and it seems to have worked.

        <updated>2022-09-09T13:07:06.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following the rocky and bug-filled launch of Battlefield 2042 last year, EA announced that Respawn’s Vince Zampella was named as the head of the Battlefield franchise amidst wider franchise changes that include the creation of a Battlefield universe. Then, a few months later, EA announced that its next Battlefield game had entered pre-production using “valuable lessons” learned from Battlefield 2042. 
While exactly what the next Battlefield game is remains confirmed, a new Battlefield-centric blog post from chief experience officer of EA Byron Beede and the Battlefield team sheds new light on a possibility. The next game might be a narrative-focused one set in the Battlefield universe. 
“Many of you know that Marcus Lehto joined the team earlier this year,” the blog post reads. “Today, we announced the name of his new Seattle-based studio, Ridgeline Games. Marcus will bring his long legacy of creating fascinating worlds and gripping narratives to Battlefield. Backed by a world-class team, he’ll be leading the charge to develop a narrative campaign set in the Battlefield universe that will engage fans in new and exciting ways while remaining true to the classic elements of the series.” 
As you can see, the blog post doesn’t indicate that Lehto’s narrative game is the next Battlefield, but it’s a possibility, as is a new multiplayer-focused project like Battlefield 2042. Only time will tell. 
There’s a lot more in the blog post, including the announcement that creative director Lars Gustavsson, who has been with the franchise since its start more than two decades ago, is leaving EA, so be sure to head there to get the full rundown.

Ah, the venerable midnight launch. The once-expected tradition of camping out for midnight game launches — so timed as to technically adhere to official game street dates while still capitalising on gamer obsessions and enthusiasm — is, at least in New York City, on the verge of extinction thanks to numerous factors like public safety, liability concerns, pandemic precautions, and overall consumer welfare.
But on this date, September 9, 2022, the spirit at least lived on, thanks to Nintendo NY’s formidable RSVP system, which requires hopeful purchasers of — in this case — Splatoon 3, to log in on their My Nintendo account, and reserve a timeslot in a virtual queue to buy the game.

I do spend quite a lot of time explaining Blackbird to Nate, but after that we do talk about some cutscenes and cinematics in games (as well as litigating the difference between the two, and Nate tries to remember the first time he saw a cutscene in a game that was in-engine rather than being pre-rendered).

Above all, a deeper level of customization lets players fine-tune their own wintry apocalypse. PlayStation enthusiasts might recognize the phrase “Play has no limits” from a string of ads. Ragnarök’s lead UX designer, Mila Pavlin, echoed the same sentiments and voiced her dedication to centering players of all walks of life. “This is a fantasy epic,” Pavlin says. “This is about a father and son. This is about fate and the Nine Realms. And the ability to go into that, regardless of your background, and be able to experience all this rich detail and history and story?

Thriller writers deal in short, snappy chapters, and the fat chapter is the one that ends up getting a load of events or exposition shoved into it, somewhere in the second half, because they wouldn't fit anywhere else. Every year in games there's a fat month, where loads of games come out and loads of them look really good and there is never enough time godammit.
This year that month is September. There are so many games out this month that look so much my jam that I want to spread 'em on my morning toast, but September is also the month that a lot of RPS staff have holiday booked - including me, for two weeks, which means that if these games do get reviewed it probably won't be by me. But know that I have my beady little eyes on 'em.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[All of the new heroes coming to Overwatch 2 will not be immediately playable at launch, and that's because you'll need to unlock them on the free track of the game's battle pass. 
Overwatch commercial leader and vice president of Blizzard Jon Spector revealed this on Twitter last night following leaks and rumors that stated the new heroes would need to be unlocked in the battle pass, which is a paid premium pass that rewards players for leveling up through it akin to passes seen in Fortnite and other games. That's partly true in that yes, new heroes will need to be unlocked through the battle pass but Spector clarified on Twitter that those heroes will be on the free track of the battle pass. 
"Addressing some incomplete info posted early about our Overwatch 2 Battle Pass – we'll be sharing all details ahead of launch, but want to confirm that new Overwatch 2 heroes will be available on the free track of the Battle Pass." 
Addressing some incomplete info posted early about our Overwatch 2 Battle Pass – we'll be sharing all details ahead of launch, but want to confirm that new Overwatch 2 heroes will be available on the free track of the Battle Pass.
September 8, 2022
As you can see, you won't need to pay any money to unlock the new heroes in Overwatch 2. However, it could still take some time to unlock these heroes depending on where they are on the free track. Only time will tell but fortunately, we don't have to wait too much longer to find out because Overwatch 2 is out Oct. 4. 
In the meantime, read about how Xbox boss Phil Spencer says Overwatch will come to Xbox Game Pass and then check out why we think Overwatch 2 feels like a completely different game. Read about how cross-progression is coming to Overwatch 2 after that. 
How do you feel about this decision in regards to unlocking heroes in Overwatch 2? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It cannot be a coincidence that 1997 is a pivotal year in the world of Jack Move. In the game, it's the year everything went dark in this turn-based Japanese-style RPG, with a solar storm biffing the world's electronics. It threw the world into chaos, giving rise to the megacorps that now control the dystopian cyberpunk society where our heroine Noa is trying to make a living. In the real world, of course, 1997 was the year Final Fantasy VII came out, the seminal JRPG that Jack Move owes a great deal to (right down to its menu plink plink sound). Developers So Romantic have said outright that it's been one of the main inspirations for Jack Move, and its shady corporate powers and grungy urban landscape certainly feel of a piece with ShinRa's grip on the city of Midgar. 
But the bigwigs at MonoMind aren't out to poison the world and suck the life from it in Jack Move. Instead, they're more concerned with using their newfound technological powers to find eternal life – a classic 'upload your mind to the metaverse' kind of tale you'll probably recognise if you've read any of the cyberpunk 101 novels such as William Gibson's Neuromancer or Permutation City by Greg Egan. Jack Move's story doesn't tread any new ground in this respect, but Noa and her hacker pal Ryder are a fiery spirited pair that make this six-hour tale of espionage and rebellion against its cartoonish villain well worth dipping into. Yes, you read that correctly. A JRPG you can polish off in a single day of play. Bliss.

Amazon Games president Christoph Hartmann recently shed light on this series of events in a new interview with GameSpot, citing that things got "very complicated" following the acquisition.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I keep thinking about Roadwarden like a tourist city that I visited for not quite long enough. Sure, I saw the main sights and had a great time soaking in the ambiance, but I know that I missed so many hidden gems. I want to go back and explore, maybe this time with a local guide who knows its secrets.
At its most basic, Roadwarden is a text-based RPG. You play as the titular roadwarden, who sets out from the city to investigate an unmapped peninsula with little more than their horse for company. Your goal as set by the people who sent you is to investigate the region and report your findings in preparation for the expansion of trade guilds in the area. But you can also set your own goal, shaping your character’s approach from the start in a way that helps with roleplaying a particular kind of adventurer throughout. And once you get to that adventuring, dozens of sidequests open up covering everything from gathering fruit to curing the plague.

A new mod for Skyrim Special Edition answers this playfully by adding a load of hidden keys to unlock these chests. Some of the keys look quite well hidden in this object hunt, so you'll need to poke around, rummage, and turn things over.

They'd escaped the clutches of the French Inquisition and the hordes of plague rats following in their wake, and the pair were hopeful about finding a cure for the cursed macula flowing through Hugo's veins.
Alas, when I pick up their journey in chapter six of Asobo's upcoming sequel, A Plague Tale: Requiem, Amicia is having a particularly terrible time of it. Not only is she suffering from an open head wound, leaving her unsteady on her feet, but rumours are flying in the nearby pilgrim camp about something bad having gone down in the last city they passed through. Exactly what is hard to say with five chapters' worth of context missing from my preview build, but the pack of guards who are hot on the siblings' trail quickly make it plain: several men died back in that city, and they're pointing the finger squarely at Amicia's knife, slingshot and crossbow.

Now, of course, regulators like the U.K.’s Competition and Markets Authority and the U.S.’ FTC must approve of this, and those investigations are ongoing. But suppose all goes according to Microsoft’s plan. In that case, the company will own Activision Blizzard, the publisher and developer behind Call of Duty, Overwatch, World of Warcraft, and more, by the spring or summer of 2023. 
Shortly after the company announced its plans to acquire Activision Blizzard, Xbox head Phil Spencer confirmed his company’s intent “to keep Call of Duty on PlayStation” following the purchase. He reaffirmed this commitment earlie…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Before Vanillaware made its name with titles like 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim and Dragon’s Crown, it found early success with a little game called GrimGrimoire. The side-scrolling strategy title garnered a cult following when it hit the PlayStation 2 in 2007, but it got another shot in the spotlight this year with the Japanese launch of GrimGrimoire OnceMore in July. Now we know when players in the U.S. and Europe get to experience Lillet’s spellbinding adventure again or for the first time. 
GrimGrimoire OnceMore comes to the west in Spring 2023 for PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and Switch. The game stars Lillet Blan, a witch-in-training who attends the famed Tower of Silver Star magic school, where things have gone awry. It’s up to her to uncover its dark secrets in an adventure that unfolds over a repeating five-day cycle. Though a side-scroller, players battle enemies by summoning and commanding Familiars in real-time strategy battles that unfold in a 2D perspective. 
OnceMore features HD graphics, a new skill tree, an improved user interface, an art gallery, and other unspecified features. 


Fans may remember Odin Sphere making a similar comeback in 2016 with the Leifthrasir edition, and it’s cool to see GrimGrimoire get the same treatment. Are you excited to replay GrimGrimoire? Will this be your first time giving it a try? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Hitman games are often good and usually fun, it’s fair to say, particularly the recent World Of Assassination trilogy. Ian Hitman’s turn in the two films released about his adventures has been rougher to recommend, though. That’s why it’s simultaneously disappointing and awesome to learn that Guardians Of The Galaxy, The Suicide Squad and – shudder – Slither director James Gunn narrowly missed his target when he pitched a Hitman movie.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Third person skater shooter Rollerdrome has some really cool weapons, but what is it that makes them so special? I mean, there’s only four of them, and you’re forced to constantly perform tricks to regain ammo, which doesn't make them easy to use. I think it’s because of their more literal significance in the game. Rollerdrome threatens you with multiple enemy types called Houseplayers, all formidable, especially in the heat of battle when they combine their efforts. Luckily, the four distinct weapons you’re equipped with act as an equaliser; each weapon is a solution for a particular enemy. Developers Roll7 could have easily added a bunch of copied and pasted guns from every generic shooter, but instead they were more intentional about the weapons they included, with each weapon complimenting the gunplay and the game as a whole.

This makes Rockstar’s cowboy epic/improvised teleconferencing software the latest game to work with AMD’s upscaler without mods; an unofficial FSR patch for RDR2 has been out for a while, but this update should make it even easier to simply enable or disable FSR in the settings menu.

Since its debut in 2015, the Splatoon series has delivered unique, colorful gameplay cribbed by scarce launch content and disappointing time restrictions for specific modes. While post-launch content greatly bolstered both games to this point, I’ve always been disappointed by how little was initially on offer. Now on its third entry, the series may feel a bit less fresh, but Splatoon 3 remedies the series’ long-standing launch content woes while retaining all the fun that made the series such a success.

Montreal adapt and reimagine these characters to keep them true to their comic origins while still surprising players? A new video breaks down its storytelling process. 
The development team explains the narrative's themes of trauma, loss, chosen family, and how it uses the Knights' long, complicated relationships to make each hero feel fully realized as individuals and as a family. WB Montreal also discusses Alfred's pivotal role as a father figure to the team, the social moments that unfold in the Belfrey hideout, and its approach to cinematic design.

In it, we're whisked to an alternative history where King Louis XVI stopped the French Revolution before it properly got going by, err, killing everyone with steampunk robots. You're Aegis, a feminine robot created to entertain and protect Queen Marie Antoinette. Marie, safe outside Paris but somewhat peeved at her husband's new penchant for extreme mass murder, sends you on a Soulslike mission to sort it all out.
This takes some doing, but luckily Aegis is a very advanced robot, the bestest of all the robots. Slight but adaptive with it, and even having an advanced AI, Aegis can carve a swift path through the more than usually twisted metal in her way. It's a bit too easy, in fact.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlayStation told players in 2020 that it could add 1440p support for game resolution output to PlayStation 5 “if requested enough.” It seems that happened because it’s now available in a new update. 
With the launch of today’s new global PS5 system software update, not only is 1440p resolution available for applicable TVs and monitors, but Gamelists and other anticipated social features are too. There’s also a new audio comparison option to listen to the difference between stereo output and 3D audio in headsets and a new YouTube voice command preview. 
“The update includes several highly-requested features like 1440p HDMI video output and gamelists, as well as social features like the ability to request a Share Screen from a fellow party member, easily view new friends’ profiles, and receive a notification to help you join a friend’s game more quickly from a party chat,” platform experience senior vice president Hideaki Nishino writes in a new PlayStation blog post. “Additionally, you can now compare 3D audio and stereo audio on the same screen and more easily access in-progress Activities from game hubs.” 
For more information about these new features, head to this breakdown here. 
This system software update will allow players in the U.S. and U.K. to preview the ability to search YouTube through voice command. 
“Another feature we’re excited to bring to more PS5 players is the ability to search for content on YouTube through Voice Command (Preview),” the blog reads. “From anywhere on PS5, including during gameplay, you can say ‘Hey PlayStation, find [keyword] on YouTube.’ The YouTube app will open, and relevant search results will be shown.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The AMD Ryzen 5 5600 is a cheaper, better-value version of the Ryzen 5600X - the CPU took the world by storm when Ryzen 5000 launched back in 2020. With six cores and 12 threads to access, you get good performance in modern game engines, while the higher single-core speeds introduced with this generation of AMD processors allows for better performance in single-core-limited (often older) games. It's a potent combination that makes the 5600X - and the 5600 - the best value AMD CPUs for gaming out there. 
Normally the 5600 retails for £173, in comparison to £185 for the 5600X, but today it's down to £150 on Amazon, coming within £10 of the best price we've ever seen on this model.

It didn't look particularly special on the outside, but it consistently beat even more expensive models in terms of thermals and performance. I resolved to get one for myself, but things went mad and I only eventually managed to get one through my work. Now though, you can get the upgraded version of that high-performer at a more reasonable price: £650 for the Tuf Gaming OC V2, an overclocked model offering excellent performance for £400 below this model's UK RRP.

Not only does it add more to V's story, with them seemingly becoming a secret service-like agent for the New United States of America, but it also sees Keanu Reeves' Johnny Silverhand return to the fold.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you’ve been looking to give your PlayStation 5 a more rugged makeover (or want to hide it while playing outdoors, somehow), a new set of camouflage accessories is on the way.
This fall, you can outfit your PS5 with gray camouflage plates, a DualSense controller, or Pulse 3D headset. While it's as camo as camo can be, eagle-eyed fans can spot tiny PlayStation symbols embedded into the lightest shades of the pattern for a nice touch. 


Pre-orders begin on September 15. The cover plates and DualSense launch globally on October 14. The headset becomes available in December. Sony has not listed prices for these items. 
Maybe one day we'll get a camo version of the recently revealed DualSense Edge controller. In related news, Sony recently increased the price of the PlayStation 5 in multiple non-U.S. territories. It also acquired Savage Games Studios as part of its newly formed mobile division.]]></summary>

I say it's a trailer that's kind of new because if you've been keeping up with Cyberpunk: Edgerunners, there's a good chance you've already seen it. It's the NSFW one released last week, but it featured Japanese VO with subtitles. Today, CDPR has released the same trailer with the English dub now.

As you can see, the English dub sounds great. The studio also announced the series will feature 12 total dubs, including English, Japanese, German, Polish, French, and more. There will be subtitles for each of those languages and many more too.

Winding footpaths led to expansive hubs at a scale unlike previous games in the franchise. Ornate chests holding rare equipment and Jötnar Shrines with lore murals were just some of the items awaiting wide-eyed players across six realms. Golden path locales like Midgard and its massive Lake of the Nine, Alfheim, home to light and dark elves, Helheim, the underworld, and Jötunheim, the land of Giants, were sprawling zones in their own right, filled with enough content to keep players engaged. Yet, the optional but equally impressive Niflheim and Muspelheim realms pushed player skills to the limit with vigorous combat trials. Despite the size and myriad navigable backdrops, the Norse universe felt …]]></summary>

I don’t think I’ve ever built one on the back of a giant animal after the apocalypse, though. Indie sci-fi citybuilder The Wandering Village will let me do that when it enters early access on Steam on September 14th.

September 6, 2022
So as for what to expect, your guess is as good as anyone else's. I wager we'll be seeing some new Pokémon, perhaps some more information about the legendaries and how they play into the wider narrative of this gen, and maybe a new look at some gym leaders. Only time will tell, but fortunately, we don't have to wait long. 
In the meantime, watch the latest Pokémon Scarlet and Violet trailer for a quick look at this gen's competitive play, and then catch up on everything we learned from the recent Pokémon Presents livestream. 
What's the one thing you really hope to see during tomorrow's trailer? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

Modders have been running their own multiplayer servers based on leaked builds of skate. for months, so it’s not surprising to see further leaks spring up from the game’s playtests.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The sight of a two-carriage train is normally something that prompts a deep sigh of despair from me in real life. Nine times out of ten, it's a sign that something's gone wrong further up the line - that someone, somewhere, has sent out a train with half its usual number of carriages, and is therefore destined to ruin everyone's day in the process by cramming us all in like a pack of sardines. 
In Afterburn's adorable train puzzler Railbound, however, two carriages are a cause for celebration. In a game that's about guiding numbered compartments onto the back of an engine (using a limited number of track tiles to get them there in the right order), two-carriage puzzles offer the perfect amount of cerebral head-scratching. They've got a bit more bite than simply guiding a single carriage to its destination, but they're not so complicated that they'll repeatedly make you reach for the hint button to help you fill in the gaps. Railbound has a tendency to be a bit too abstract in its later stages, but more on that in a sec. All you need to know right now is that there are plenty of smart ideas to wrap your head around here, and that you'll be grinning from ear to ear by the time you reach the end of the line.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The New Delhi High Court has issued a site-blocking injunction in favor of Star India to protect the film "Brahmastra". Local ISPs have been ordered to block 18 pirate sites but the same order also applies to domain registrars, including US-based Namecheap and GoDaddy. These far-reaching measures apply to a movie that hasn't yet been released and hasn't been pirated either.

Developer Askiisoft released a near-ten minute slice of the DLC's first level over the weekend, showing off some of the ultraviolent delights we can expect to see when it eventually comes out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[BioShock Remastered, BioShock 2 Remastered and BioShock Infinite have all fallen afoul of some questionably titled “quality of life” updates that publishers 2K Games released last week. These updates added a new 2K Launcher to all three BioShocks that appears when booting them up from Steam, but as found by GamingOnLinux, something about this launcher doesn’t take kindly to Linux-based operating systems. Linux-based operating systems like the Steam Deck’s SteamOS.


As it happens, then, there's a chance – if you’re trying to play on Valve’s handheld PC – that all these updates will do is swing a bloodied 9-iron into the Deck’s ability to launch the affected games at all. Whoopsie doodle.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in the mists of time of 2014, the original Tales From The Borderlands followed the classic Telltale episodic template, with a new chapter dropping every three or four months. Gearbox Software's upcoming New Tales From The Borderlands, however, is going to be doing things a bit differently. As our PAX West team found out over the weekend, NuTales will still be split up into an episodic-style chapter structure, according to director of production James Lopez, but you won't have to wait several months before you can play them altogether.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A truly dynamic story is a goal game designers have strived toward for decades. Worldwalker Games' Wildermyth gets closer to that goal than most. In this spellbinding RPG, players guide bands of heroes through a lifetime of adventure, embarking on dozens of short, whimsical quests wherein they grow, age, and quite literally evolve, with the potential to transform into walking trees, celestial beings, and anthropomorphised crows.


Wildermyth is an inspired example of narrative design, with some nifty tactical combat to boot. But when Nate Austin, his wife Annie, and his brother Doug began developing the game around eight years ago, the weight of emphasis between storytelling and combat was very much the other way around.

The store page has since been taken down, but not before it was spotted by a few eagle-eyed Twitterers. Seeing as the next Ubisoft Forward showcase is scheduled for this coming Saturday, it’s entirely possible that we’ll be seeing some concrete deets about Heartland then.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's the dawn of day three here at  PAX West, and what better way to wake us up than play the incredibly chaotic demo build of
 Friends VS Friends. We loved the trailer from Gamescom and Liam even chose it for his bestest pick in our Gamescom round-up video, so our expectations were high, and after playing a quick match at the Raw Fury booth, Brainwash Gang's blood-pumping deck-building FPS shot straight to the top of our favourite things we've seen here at PAX so far.
If you've not heard of Friends VS Friends, check out the game's trailer first (its incredibly slick animation is super cool, highly reccomended for your peepers) then watch our interview with Brainwash Gang developer Edu Verz who talked all about the game's development. Watch it below:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today's PAX West interview is with the one and only Ron Gilbert, series creator of the iconic point-and-click adventure series, Monkey Island. We are big fans of Monkey Island here at RPS, so after watching him guest speak on the Adventure Games PAX panel today, we got a chance to chinwag with Gilbert and to chat about his upcoming comeback to the series with Return to Monkey Island.
Gilbert was lovely enough to tell us all about the next game in the Monkey Island saga -  what it was like to return to Monkey Island's world after so long, what we can expect from the puzzles, and snippets of the game's story. Watch below to see the interview in its entirety and make sure you watch to the end to see my impression of a pirate - you won't wanna miss that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's day two of PAX West and to kick off our second day of game events and demos we got hands-on with a build of Neowiz's Pinocchio RPG, Lies of P. The gameplay demo caused quite a stir when it was at Gamescom earlier this year, so we made it one of our priorities to check it out here in Seattle.
Neowiz are not actually at PAX so there wasn't anyone on the team to give us some behind-the-scenes info, but I got stuck into the demo for a solid 30 minutes, brawling with the game's angry robot lads that roamed the city's blood-washed cobbled streets.
Overall, I had a great time with the demo. Yes, it is incredibly similar to Bloodborne in both its combat and environments but there are plenty of other elements that steer it away from FromSoftware's horror-filled gothic RPG. If you want more details instead of that short summary then check out our video below where I talk about my time with the build, and about having my arse kicked by giant mechanical automatons. Enjoy!

Rather than the £200 or £300 prices we normally see attached to these enclosures, this one was available at just £93. Now that deal is back, once again via the Laptop Outlet store on Ebay. 
This time though, you'll  need to use code FANCY15 to knock 15% off the price of the BoostStation, bringing it down to that alluring £93 price point once again.

Then, during Gamescom’s Opening Night Live event, Gearbox officially revealed the sequel, which is less a direct continuation of Telltale’s story and more a spiritual successor to the series, which is evident in its official name: New Tales from the Borderlands. 
That new trailer gave us a look at the new protagonists – altruistic scientist Anu, her street-wise brother Octavio, and local business owner Fran – as well as a look at just how Tales from the Borderlands this new entry is this time around. Sure, it’s a new cast and an all-new story in the world of Borderlands, but it’s clear it will play and feel familiar…]]></summary>

        <updated>2022-09-02T22:16:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fans of Splitgate, the sci-fi multiplayer shooter with portals, received some bittersweet news today. Developer 1047 Games has announced it’s finally bringing the game out of its lengthy beta and launching it in 1.0 next month. It also revealed plans to create another title within the Splitgate universe. But to facilitate work on this next project, it will cease feature development of Splitgate.
1047 explains in a press release that it’s developing a new shooter in Unreal Engine 5 set in the world of Splitgate, which means it will also feature portals. There aren't any more details beyond this, but it will be the team’s full-time project going forward. 
As such, 1047 is launching Splitgate out of beta on September 15, but it will move away from creating substantial content after that. However, the team assures fans that Splitgate will remain online. The game’s launch will kick off a new season, which includes a new, free battle pass featuring an infinite number of levels along with new characters, skins, and other goodies. Splitgate’s weekly featured playlists, and item drops will continue, and the team will still work on smaller fixes and updates. 
You can read 1047's full statement below (click to enlarge):
Splitgate launched in PC beta in 2019, but the game really caught fire when its console beta began in 2021. The game became so popular on PlayStation and Xbox that servers regularly became congested, to the point that 1047 decided to postpone the full launch and keep the game in an indefinite beta to focus on further stabilizing the online infrastructure as the project continued to receive more funding. Season 0 began last August, adding a new map, game mode, and other features.]]></summary>

Since its launch in 2013, Revengence’s action and absurdity have garnered it a passionate internet fandom, but I have a little secret: I didn’t think the game was all that special when I played it at launch. However, years of being inundated with internet memes and being told my opinion is incorrect has inspired me to give Revengece another look. Will I acquire a new appreciation for the game nine years later? How many watermelons will I slice? You’ll have to tune in to find out. 
Watch on Twitch!
Join me, Marcus Stewart, along with Andrew Reiner and Blake Hester, as we revisit Raiden’s beloved solo adventure.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[DC Fandome, the virtual fan convention showcasing DC movies, TV shows, and, of course, video games, will not take place this year, Warner Bros. Discovery confirms. 
The first DC Fandome took place in 2020, serving as a livestream alternative to in-person conventions in the wake of the pandemic. It featured virtual panels with celebrities and filmmakers that provided new announcements, trailers, and early looks at all things DC media. In terms of video games, the 2020 and 2021 editions gave us substantial new looks at Gotham Knights and Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. 
In a statement to Popverse, Warner Bros. Discovery explains the decision by writing:
Fandome’s cancellation is an unfortunate blow in the ongoing transition resulting from April’s Warner Bros./Discovery merger. Although only two years old, Fandome has found great success, generating millions of views. Last year's show was highlighted by new trailers for The Batman, Black Adam, and The Flash. Unfortunately, the DC film slate has largely been flipped on its head since then as several projects have been delayed (Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom, Shazam! Fury of the Gods), in limbo (The Flash), or canceled (Batgirl). 
While we won't see them during DC's big event, Gotham Knights launches on October 21, and Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League arrives sometime in 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At Gamescom I sat down with a lovely ice cold beer and two lovely lads who ran me through military real-time tactics sequel Men Of War II in a 45-minute hands-off presentation. As a total freshman to the series, I was a little intimidated by the prospect of sinking my feet into the trenches of a dense strategy bonanza, especially as things kicked off with a literal history lesson.
But after watching and absorbing one of the game's early missions, I can genuinely say that I'd be confident enough to give it a go when it comes out. Even perhaps, confident enough to say that I'd genuinely enjoy it quite a bit as a total newbie.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Oh my goodness, what a creepy, funny, and odd game Northern Journey is. I almost don't want to say any more about it, not because it can be spoiled but because it seems appropriately respectful. Not in a reverent sense, you understand. It just feels like such a world should be preserved, even slightly feared, rather than trampled on by some idiot with a camera in her face.
To call Northern Journey "retro" would completely misrepresent it. It's beautiful in an ugly, desolate way reminiscent of Kenshi or Morrowind. It's translucent in its exposition but not obtuse, hostile, or obnoxiously hard. It's a bit clunky, without that ever undermining the experience. It's vaguely amateurish, yet almost consciously so, like a painter who knows their talent and intent is enough to overcome any technical flaws. This is a bloody treat and I'm so glad I got to play it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Another indie developer has come forward publicly with allegations that UK-based publishers PQube have withheld money from them. Thai dev team Corecell claim they’ve only seen some of the minimum guaranteed money agreed when they signed the European console publishing rights to their action-puzzle game AeternoBlade 2 over to PQube in 2019. 

Corecell say they attempted to resolve things with PQube but that didn’t work, and they had to terminate the publishing agreement in 2020. Since then, Corecell have tried to regain the rights to AeternoBlade 2 from PQube to no avail. Corecell allege that PQube did offer to return the rights to the game, but only if they would agree to keep the situation secret.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Statistically, there’s a good chance you clicked onto this page with a Logitech G502 mouse. Between its Proteus Spectrum and refreshed Hero models, the G502 has sold boatloads, and was voted as RPS readers’ favourite gaming mouse in both 2019 and 2021. Not undeservedly either, as it’s sat atop our best gaming mouse rankings for years. Making more drastic improvements to it wouldn’t therefore seem like a pressing priority, but Logitech have had a crack regardless with the new G502 X series.


There’s a trio of redesigned rodents in this family: the standard G502 X I’ve got on review here, the wireless G502 X Lightspeed, and the G502 X Plus, which is essentially the G502 X Lightspeed with added RGB lighting. Since prices max out at £150 / $160 for the G502 X Plus, the two Lightspeed-equipped mice could be less expensive alternatives to Razer’s new DeathAdder V3 Pro and Basilisk V3 Pro – but as the cheapest and most direct successor the G502 Hero, it’s the G502 X that’s likely to see the most desk action. Does it deserve to?

For the uninitiated, Night City Wire is basically like CDPR's version of a Nintendo Direct, except the showcases are specifically focused on Cyberpunk 2077. They were quite prevalent in the leadup to the release of Cyberpunk 2077, but now, with it nearing two years old, Night City Wire has grown to be rarer. The next one airs on Sept. 6 at 8 a.m. PT/11 a.m. ET, though, and will be "about our upcoming anime Cyberpunk: Edgerunners and what's next for Cyberpunk 2077."
Choooom! There's something new on the horizon – a special episode of Night City Wire!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[First impressions can be interesting. I didn’t know what to expect when I met David Ventura at the Backbeat booth, after a long opening day of the weekend-long Japanese indie gaming event BitSummit. I knew of his work - now the CEO of his self-founded studio Ichigoichie with developers based both in Japan and Sweden, Ventura has had his hands in a number of highly-influential rhythm games over the course of his career. This includes work on Gitaroo Man and Elite Beat Agents during his time in Japan at iNiS, having worked at the studio for a decade before moving to Sweden to work outside of games on educational music software. In 2018 he returned to games by founding Ichigoichie (stylised as 151A). Their first game, Hexagroove, blended strategy, rhythm and educational tools for a game that captured the building blocks of being a DJ.


Ventura was at BitSummit to showcase the successor to this game, Backbeat. It’s a bit of a departure from much of his past work, acting more like a puzzle game with a musical soul, albeit one where the act of creating and playing music together is imbued into every solution. As the crowd began to leave the bustling convention hall for the day, I went to the booth for one last demo, and the chance to speak to the person behind it all… who was sat at his demo kiosk playing the keytar.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Avalanche and Warner Bros. Interactive have released a new Hogwarts Legacy featurette that dives deep into the design of the titular school. It also features the first-ever look at the four house common rooms in Hogwarts Legacy, a sneak peek of some of the easter eggs in the game, and more. 
This new featurette runs more than four minutes long and gives players the most in-depth look at the actual school of Hogwarts in this game thus far. As noted in the video, the design of Hogwarts is based on the eight Harry Potter movies and the books written by controversial author J.K. Rowling, who will undoubtedly be making money from the sales of this game. 
Check out the featurette for yourself below: 


As you can see, Hogwarts is looking great, as are the four common rooms. What’s especially interesting is it gives viewers a look at the Hufflepuff common room, which has rarely been seen on screen in the wizarding world, as pointed out in the video. 
What’s more, the featurette also contains information about linking your WB Games account to your Harry Potter Fan Club account. Doing so will automatically bring your Fan Club wand into the game alongside your Hogwarts house, which can be determined on the Fan Club’s site through a special sorting quiz. You’ll also unlock some in-game rewards for doing so, too, including a special decorative house robe and a beaked skull mask. Check them out in the gallery below: 

For more, read about how Hogwarts Legacy has been delayed from 2022 to February 10, 2023, and then check out the unique PlayStation 5 DualSense features for Hogwarts Legacy. Watch this Hogwarts Legacy trailer from last week that showcases unforgivable curses and Sebastian Sallow’s Dark Legacy questline after that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After growing to become one of the most-leaked games in franchise history, Ubisoft has confirmed that Assassin's Creed Mirage is real and we'll be learning more about it next week.
That's because the publisher is hosting a Ubisoft Forward on Sept. 10 at Noon P.T./3 p.m. ET, which has been previously advertised as the event where we'll learn more about the future of Assassin's Creed and more. It seems Assassin's Creed Mirage will be the big highlight of the show, but it's possible we learn more about Assassin's Creed Infinity, which is Ubisoft's in-development Assassin's Creed live-service platform. We might even learn about non-Assassin's Creed games, too. 
Assassin's Creed Mirage is the next Assassin's Creed game.

September 1, 2022
If rumors and leaks about Assassin's Creed Mirage are correct, we're in for a game set in Baghdad with Basim, a major character from Assassin's Creed Valhalla (if you know, you know), as the protagonist. Leaks indicate that he's not yet an assassin at the start of Mirage and instead, a thief who comes to discover the Hidden Ones, which later become the Assassin's order in the series. Rumors also point to this game being a much more stripped back take on the franchise, feeling more like older games in the series rather than the massive and sprawling open-world RPGs of late.
The potential for this to feel like a bridge between classic Assassin's Creed and new Assassin's Creed has me incredibly excited. I love the new games, especially Origins and Odyssey, but they're downright exhausting. An Assassin's Creed game I can beat in less than 80 hours? Sign me up!
In the meantime, read Game Informer's ranking of every Assassin's Creed game and then catch up on everything announced during the Assassin's Creed 15th Anniversary Celebration stream that aired earlier this summer.

Online Campaign Co-Op
The biggest addition in the update finally goes live following a beta period in July. Campaign co-op, which supports up to four players, features cross-platform support, shared progression, mission replay, and a batch of new achievements. 
However, campaign co-op will be online only. 343 announced that it has chosen to cease development on local splitscreen co-op to reallocate those resources towards quickly implementing online updates and improvements based on player feedback.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a new blog post, Xbox head Phil Spencer discussed Microsoft’s intentions for Activision Blizzard’s IPs following its ongoing acquisition of the company. Among those plans, naturally, is to bolster the value of Xbox Game Pass by adding Activision Blizzard’s library of titles, including Call of Duty, Overwatch, and Diablo.
Spencer discusses expanding player choice through Game Pass by offering library titles for an affordable subscription fee, appealing to players of various budgets. Spencer hopes that including Activision Blizzard games will make the service more appealing to existing and potential subscribers. 
Spencer also reiterates Microsoft’s promise to keep popular Activision Blizzard franchises multiplatform, citing its handling of Minecraft as an example. Additionally, the company hopes to expand Activision’s portfolio to mobile platforms and make them available to play on other devices via cloud streaming. 
Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard is projected to be completed sometime during the summer of 2023. After that, it's anyone’s guess as to how long it will be before we see these franchises land on Game Pass. On the Blizzard side, Overwatch 2 launches in free-to-play early access on October 4, and Diablo IV is seemingly years away. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II releases in October, but the series will reportedly skip 2023, meaning the first entry under the Microsoft banner won't be until 2024 at the earliest.

The cheerful game blends monster collecting (the Ooblets), farming simulation, and light town management as you restore a wacky village to its former glory.

That’s where I come in. I’ve spent many hours playing the final version of the game, and I’d like to offer some helpful tips to make your early hours in Badgetown as enjoyable and efficient as possible.

Endnight Games' post on Twitter (seen above) says, in recent months, an exact drop date has been hard to pinpoint, but the newfound scope led to the team's hard decision:
Based on trailers, Sons of the Forest is the studio's most ambitious title yet, with a vast open world, a new AI companion, updated visuals, and multiple warring factions scattered throughout the landscape. It looks to be even more brutal and terrifying than the last game, and I can't wait to get my hands on it.

Unfortunately for Anita, it's not a great time to be in the town because of some strange ritualistic things happening.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Soldier Boyz is the newest supported game of the Hypno engine, and it’s ready for public testing!
Released in 1997 by Hypnotix and published by DreamCatcher Interactive and MCPA Interactive, this full-motion rail shooter is based on the 1995 film of the same name. The game starts when the daughter of an American billionaire is kidnapped by a group of Vietnamese terrorists. Then, it’s up to Major Howard Toliver, ex-Marine and highly decorated Vietnam veteran, to gather a deadly team for the dangerous mission of rescuing her. He recruits six prison inmates serving life sentences for a chance at a full presidential pardon.
Keep the body count rising to survive five territories by playing as each Soldier Boy (and Girl),
but beware and don’t waste a “friendly” since they provide vital survival information!
ScummVM currently supports the English release of the game (which is the only one we know about) and features more responsive controls than the original. We couldn't find a demo but there is a trailer. Please contact us if you have a demo or any other release.
To play the game with ScummVM, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker.
