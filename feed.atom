While the last couple of E3s haven't been quite what we're used to for obvious reasons, it's the memories of glorious summers past which keep our enthusiasm for the event alive. Earlier this year we took a look at a handful of Nintendo's most iconic E3 moments, but researching for that article and rewatching Nintendo's conferences was also a harsh reminder of the days of Standard Definition video — a far cry from the HD and UHD we're used to these days.
However, if you're looking to relive the exciting (for should that be Excite-ing) days of 2006, GoldMetalSonic on Twitter has taken it upon themselves to upscale Nintendo's conference footage and gift everyone the cleanest version yet of the last E3 before the Wii arrived and propelled the company to levels of success not seen since the 8-bit days.

Full UK physical chart data is now in for the week ending 25th December, giving the full picture on festive sales. All told it was a solid week for Switch titles, though the presence of its games was reduced slightly due to boosted sales of multiplatform releases.
Leading the way for Switch, somewhat predictably, was Mario Kart 8 Deluxe; the outstanding racer is no doubt a go-to purchase for anyone picking up a new Switch, and of course it features in some bundles. The ongoing success of the game is truly impressive, with the Switch iteration achieving numbers that were impossible for the Wii U original.

Last week, we heard from Intel's boss how global chip shortages were likely to continue all the way through to 2023, and now we've got another update, this time from Nintendo's president Shuntaro Furukawa.
According to Furukawa, year-end sales of the Switch have been quite strong (especially for the OLED model), and Nintendo is now concerned it won't be able to make as many units as it wants, which could see supply stagnate after the start of 2022.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Legendary commentator, broadcaster, and NFL Hall of Fame coach John Madden has passed away today at the age of 85.
Madden was best known for his role in the NFL as head coach for the Oakland Raiders from 1969–1978, where he led the team to a Super Bowl XI victory in the 1976 season. He later became an unforgettable, bombastic broadcaster for CBS, Fox, ABC, and NBC, covering and commentating on NFL games every week. Along with his memorable advertisements for companies like "Tough Actin'" Tinactin to his various cameos in film and television, he was a nearly inescapable part of American culture for well over 30 years following his successful coaching career.
Thanks, Coach pic.twitter.com/jGx8aVdRPj
December 29, 2021
We also know John Madden from his years of being involved in video games, having a franchise emblazoned with his name since John Madden Football in 1988. For 23 years, he had given his name, likeness, and often times his voice and infectious persona to the games developed by Electronic Arts now known as Madden NFL. He has an indelible legacy in the world of sports, video games, and culture at large. The least we can say is thank you, John, for the years of sharing your knowledge with your players and audience, being endlessly entertaining, and playing such a big part in making video games what they are today.
Our condolences go out to John's wife Virginia, their sons Michael and Joseph, and their families, friends, and loved ones who knew John.]]></summary>

NFL coach and broadcaster John Madden has passed away at the age of 85. He not only had a huge impact on American football but also the video game industry as the voice, name and face of Electronic Arts' Madden NFL series.
The sports series originally began life in 1988 as "John Madden Football" and over the years was released across a range of platforms including Nintendo ones. On behalf of the community here at Nintendo Life, our thoughts go out to John's friends and family during this difficult period.

Whether you're looking for a shooter or a way to get some cardio in, here are a few of the best VR games for you to play with your new Oculus Quest 2.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[LEGO and Sega are teaming up for a New Year's release of the LEGO Ideas Sonic the Hedgehog Green Hill Zone set. The build is a take on some iconic stage pieces from the speedster's first outing, complete with a Sonic minifig and a devious Dr. Eggman.
You'll be able to build this 2D-inspired set early next year that features modular elements, which looks to allow the level to be rearranged or connected to other LEGO sets for fun mashups. 
Here's the full rundown of features as told by LEGO:
5 minifigures, including a new version of Sonic and also Crab, Motobug, Dr. Eggman, and Phantom Ruby
10 ring boxes
Modular build, which can be linked to other architecture sets
Interactive elements and easter eggs, such as:
Those gem rewards are colorful Chaos Emeralds you can collect and store on a special pedestal as you find them.
LEGO fans design these LEGO Ideas sets and this Sonic-themed kit was submitted by Viv Granell, described as a LEGO superfan based out of the UK. After submission, Ideas are voted on by the public, and those who get a total of 10,000 votes are considered by LEGO to be released as a real set. Fortunately for Sonic fans and Granell, this one made the grade just in time for the blue blur's 30th anniversary. 
This LEGO Ideas Sonic the Hedgehog Green Hill Zone set will be available for purchase through LEGO's website on January 1, 2022, and will cost $69.99. 
What do you think of this Sonic LEGO set? Does it do justice to Green Hill Zone? What other levels would you like to see in brick form? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

2016 is a long, long, loooong time ago now, but I'll try to take you back to October 20th, 2016, the day the Nintendo Switch was announced. The US Presidential Election was looming, Brexit was still a massive question mark, and Disney's Moana, Disney's Rogue One, Disney's Captain America: Civil War, and Disney's Finding Dory were dominating movie news headlines.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Remedy's recent dealings with Epic Games haven't stopped the developer from making moves elsewhere in the industry. It's been revealed in a communication to investors that Remedy Games has developed a relationship with Tencent for a global license, development, and distribution deal for a new cooperative multiplayer game currently codenamed Vanguard.
Vanguard is said to be a free-to-play, co-op, PvE shooter that's an IP owned by Remedy and will combine "Remedy’s narrative expertise and action gameplay into an immersive multiplayer experience." The deal will apparently have Tencent localize and publish the game for "selected Asian markets," while Remedy will handle development and distribution globally in other territories. It also allows Tencent the license to create a mobile version that the two entities have "agreed on a separate revenue sharing scheme for.
Here's Remedy Entertainment CEO, Tero Virtala's statement on the partnership:
We don't know much else about Vanguard other than it's being developed for consoles and PC using the Unreal Engine. You can read the full announcement on Remedy's investor site here, and after that, read about its current deal with 505 Games, which includes another multiplayer game set in the Control universe. For even more Remedy check out the Alan Wake 2 trailer from The Game Awards earlier this month.]]></summary>

Standing at roughly seven feet in height and weighing nearly 1,000 pounds, he has the stature of a superhero. His exploits on the battlefield back up his size – a one-man army capable of turning the tide of war. We've seen how resourceful and powerful he can be in story sequences and advertisements, but many of those dynamic actions don't cross over to when the player controls him. He can swing big hammers, pilot any vehicle, and run and gun with swift grace, but so can most combatants in the game. Prior Halo gameplay hasn't made him look like the super soldier we envision. Enter the grapple shot, a new gadget in Halo Infinite that adds dynamic layers to this series' beloved combat and makes Master Chief look like a gun-toting superhero.…]]></summary>

Since the launch of the free-to-play multiplayer component, 343 Industries has done a nice job of offering up colorful items for players to purchase. The latest rotation brings back someone who we may all love more than Master Chief.
That someone is Mister Chief! The adorable and overly intense comic version of Master Chief is now in Halo Infinite through a 2,000 credit bundle. This collection gives you AI models, charms, a nameplate, weapon, armor, and vehicle emblems that are modeled after this character.
The shop doesn't offer any new Spartan armors today and instead focuses on vehicles. If you like your vehicles in shades of blue, you can purchase the A259 Collection, which gives you the blue Noble Principle vehicle coating, the Pilchuck Bumper for the warthog, and Blue Commando emblems.
You can also take to the skies in the all-white Snow Blind vehicle coating that is a part of the Snow Bird bundle. This pack comes with the Tundra Purist weapon coating and Sabre Response emblems.
The daily item listed today shows you what Master Chief's skateboard would probably look like. The Shred or Die bundle comes with a Shreddin' nameplate, UA/Type ST knee pads, a skull charm, and skateboard-themed emblems.]]></summary>

However, there’s one that might be a perfect fit for your comfy holiday play sessions. It’s a turn-based RPG that’s got some adventure and puzzle elements with a bit of humor and a cozy aesthetic. That’s right, we’re talking about Echo Generation, which is also available on Game Pass, so if you’re not sure you’re interested, that’s a great way to give it a shot and see.

Echo Generation, in a nutshell, is a burrito of homecooked 80s and 90s love.  So yeah, it’s basically Stranger Things meets Earthbound, with a fun turn-based combat system that’s more like Paper Mario or South Park: The Stick of Truth. In combat, you not only control the two main c…]]></summary>

Here at Nintendo Life we're huge fans of Ancient, the company set up by composer Yuzo Koshiro and his family which has worked on some absolute brilliant games over the last three decades — including Mega Drive classics Streets of Rage 2 and Beyond Oasis, and more recently the excellent Gotta Protectors on 3DS.
The company's latest release, Royal Anapoko Academy, recently launched on Switch eShop in Japan and after spending time with this Japan-only release, we have so far found it to be a thoroughly enjoyable and superior slice of silly strategy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As a series, Forza Horizon has been on a roll for some time. After visiting Australia in the third installment and touring Great Britain in the fourth, we’ve known for some time that the newest and fifth entry in the long-running racer would transport us to the idyllic environs of Mexico. But it wasn’t until we got the final game in our hands that it became clear; Playground Games has gone above and beyond, crafting one of the best looking new-gen games on the market, and filling it with some of the most entertaining racing experiences in memory.
A good opener can go a long way to setting a game’s tone, and Forza Horizon 5 nails the landing – both figuratively and literally. In a rollicking opening sequence, one vehicle after another goes parachuting out from a cargo plane, dropping into various locales across Mexico. In just a few short minutes, the game makes a case for its tremendous potential, showing off everything from muddy offroad races through rivers and jungles, to blazing street races in supercars most of us will never drive in real life.

More specifically, $80 million will go to members of the class-action suit, with the remaining $20 million covering legal fees for the plaintiffs. 
According to The Washington Post's Shannon Liao, "All current and former California employees and contractors who identify as women and worked at Riot Games between November 2014 and present day qualify for a payout." With the number of eligible participants counting upwards of 2,300 women, those who have a longer tenure with the company or were employed by Riot earlier are subject to receiving a larger claim of the payout.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Death Stranding and Metal Gear Solid director Hideo Kojima has a couple of new projects in the works, according to SiliconEra's report referencing a New Year's interview with Famitsu. 
Not a lot is said about the substance of Kojima's projects, but he mentions he is working on both a "big" title and a "new challenging" project. Differentiating that second title as "new" may imply a fresh IP for Kojima Productions, while the other could be something the studio is already familiar with. We'll have to wait a while longer to find out whether that's the case or not.
Kojima also stressed the want to create media outside of the confines of gaming, which falls in line with Kojima Productions' recent opening of a new business division focused on developing TV and film projects. 
Famitsu's column includes interviews with 127 game developers looking forward to 2022 and their aspirations for the upcoming year. Other industry luminaries you can find in there include Koei Tecmo Games' Fumihiko Yasuda, Capcom's Takayuki Nakayama, and Yoshinori Kitase of Square Enix.]]></summary>

When it comes to accessibility options in video games, some companies have been quicker than others to acknowledge the need and introduce basic features into their games. While progress has been made over the past few years, there's still much room for improvement and even the most elementary of accessibility options can improve immeasurably the gaming experience for many players. Bespoke hardware like the Hori Flex and the Xbox Adaptive Controller enable gamers to adapt controls to their specific requirements, but there's plenty that developers and platform holders like Nintendo could do at a software level to improve things.

Video games can't really be boiled down to a number. Many people may see a middling 5/10 review score — defined as 'Average' on the Nintendo Life scale — and decide to avoid the title at all costs. But what exactly does that 5 mean? We thankfully have a big ol' chunk of text to accompany that number, but the path to deciding on numerical value is complicated.
What we're trying to say is a game with a low score isn't necessarily a bad game. The package might be messy but sometimes there's a lot of good along the way. As with any review, it's all subjective and what some may deem 'Poor' may be viewed entirely differently by others.
For the next few days Alex, Zion and Jon are putting a spotlight on games they agree are troubled but have elements that shine through and give heart. Not everything below a 7 should be avoided and these are a few games we believe are still worth your time despite their problems. We begin today with Zion's pick.

Over the last three decades, many types of Sonic fan have emerged and evolved. The type of fan you are often depends on where you jumped aboard the platforming franchise. You've got your 2D purists, your handheld advocates, your 3D defenders, your Werehog worriers, your people who say the 8-bit games were better than the 16-bit ones... and that's just the tip of the Green Hill.

Terranigma is a SNES title that holds a special place in the heart of many an RPG fan, which is remarkable when you consider that it was only released in Japan and Europe, and bypassed North America entirely. Part of Quintet's loose RPG trilogy (which also includes Soul Blazer and Illusion of Gaia), Terranigma has become a cult classic in modern times – so much so that fans are currently petitioning Square Enix for some form of re-release on modern systems.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["Switch would, indeed, be a very good fit for them".
Charles Cecil needs no introduction to lovers of adventure games. The veteran designer co-founded Revolution Software in 1990 and produced a series of classic graphic adventure games including Lure of the Temptress and the Broken Sword series. His most recent project, Beyond a Steel Sky, released on Switch at the end of November and reunited Cecil with Watchmen co-creator Dave Gibbons on a long-awaited follow-up to Beneath a Steel Sky, the classic 2D adventure they released back in 1994 — the hey days of the classic point-and-click adventure game.
Recently we were fortunate enough to speak with Cecil via email to find out a little more about the project, what it was like returning to a world he created over a quarter of a century ago, and to see if he has plans for further adventures on Switch...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Diablo has, for good reasons, become a shorthand for describing the flavour of gothic, grimdark fantasy setting in games, where pus-filled demonic hordes and rotting, undead corpses scour a hellish cathedral looking for unwitting adventurers. For all its wretched decay, however, the series still feels like an indulgence to be savoured. Its clickiness and abhorrent sights make the games endlessly gratifying, and masterful butchery of fiends eases most players into a comfortable rhythm. And part of that appeal lies in the macabre yet captivating fantasy it so deftly peddles — all that blood, gore and guts really make for a grisly setting that’s nearly impossible to look away from.


Tainted Grail: Conquest conveys the same sense of blight and doom in its dark fantasy universe — one that’s a reimagining of Arthurian legends — but also ups the ante with a huge wallop of Slay The Spire’s roguelike, deck-building elements.

It's due to arrive at some point in the "holiday 2022", so when exactly can we expect the blue blur's next outing? According to the PlayStation database tracker 'PlayStation Game Size', Sonic's next adventure has been listed for 15th November.

As you might recall, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate was the "final mission" assigned to Masahiro Sakurai by the late Satoru Iwata.
The Switch entry went on to become a huge success and has now sold over 25 million copies worldwide. After the game shipped, Sakurai's "next mission" was to release all of the DLC, and he's now also done that.

We've known about the new massive paid expansion coming to Monster Hunter Rise for some time now, but so far, little has been revealed about it.
That's all set to change next year - with Capcom teasing on social media it would share much more around Spring 2022, in the lead up to Sunbreak's Summer 2022 release.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ever wanted to play a 4v1 asymmetrical horror game where four survivors face off against a killer? Wait, that’s called Dead by Daylight. Propnight essentially combines the asymmetrical antics of Dead by Daylight with PropHunt, which creates a different experience entirely, as survivors can turn into books, chairs, hot dogs, crates, giant pianos and stuffed bears, and basically anything else in the environment. While the game has a lot of various features and mechanics that players will recognize from Dead by Daylight such as the survivors working on various objectives to open the exit gates, the game has a decidedly different tone. While games can still get plenty sweaty, it’s hard to take things seriously when players are possessing giant pigs and jumping on the killer’s head, stunning them, and then hopping into a backpack and hiding on a bookshelf.

There are no perks to sift through on either side of the equation, so whether you’re the survivor or the killer, props are the key element for success or failure. Some props, like giant pigs or rolling wheels, are easy to spot and chase, but others like diminutive soda bottles or logs can blend in seamlessly with the environment. If you turn a corner as a survivor under a chase and spot something you can turn into, the killer could easily run by your location completely oblivious to you standing still right there. Props also let you get around the environment in far more dynamic ways than as a human, being able to execute flittering swoops, jumps, and other fare around the board with verticality. Of course, the killer isn’t defenseless here, as they have their own tools. In fact, one killer, The Imposter, can actually pretend to be a survivor and turn into props as well. Talk about deception!
If you’re looking for a bizarre take on existing mechanics, this is one you might want to check out.
Propnight is currently available on PC.]]></summary>

Tower defense games are all over the place, but the Bloons franchise has really taken off in the wake of an era of incredibly popular map mods that embraced the genre, many of which got started in Warcraft 3 or StarCraft. Dedicated tower defense games exist as well and are especially pervasive on mobile platforms, with titles from the Kingdom Rush franchise being notable. Anyway though, this time it’s all about the bloons!

While the feature set of the Xbox Series X is impressive (not to mention its stellar backward compatibility library), you probably want some games to play on that beast of a console.

The DC comics IP has a long history of films, and this particular one features the classic Catwoman alongside our caped crusader. Watch the trailer right here!

A bit of a lesser-utilized villain in comparison to notable giants like The Joker, The Riddler could make for an interesting antagonist in this film. I do hope that it doesn’t turn into the Batman version of Saw given how the Riddler is more of a hands-off style foe, and now we have a big two-minute trailer to check out. In it, we see plenty of staples - the dark, gritty Gotham, the Batmobile, an ostensible journey into the Wayne family’s checkered past, and more. All-in-all, this looks like a suitably dark take on Batman.
That said, a trailer doesn’t really ever capture the essence of a movie, so we’ll have to wait and see quite a bit more. The theatres only decision may turn out to be an interesting choice – while I’m sure many folks are eager to return to theaters to see high-profile films, especially after the resounding success of the latest Spider-Man, it’s unknown where society and the world will be in March regarding the ongoing pandemic situation. Let’s hope for the best and prepare for popcorn! What were your takeaways from the trailer? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

In other words, it takes a powerfully constructed piece of storytelling to crack through my emotional outer bark. Life is Strange: True Colors is that kind of storytelling. Deck Nine’s affective adventure game didn’t just punch through my hard outer shell. It sliced through me like a hot iron.
True Colors isn’t an action-packed thrill ride, but its narrative is incredibly engrossing and hard to put down nonetheless. From the jump, players meet Alex Chen, a young woman re-entering society after a stint in a foster care center. As the game opens, Alex arrives in the small mountain town of Haven Springs, Colorado, to live with her brother. However, after Alex and her friends get caught in a mining demolition explosion, Alex is thrust into a larger corporate coverup that tears apart the lives of nearly everyone in town.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Slitherfang stands among the most impressive new machines of Horizon Forbidden West. Fans got their first glimpse of this intimidating hybrid of a cobra and rattlesnake in a new trailer from The Game Awards. This towering serpent packs a wallop, and we got to watch Aloy go head-to-head with it.
A new hands-off look at a jaw-dropping boss fight against this mechanical serpent gave us a good idea of everything it can do. First and foremost, the Slitherfang can fire pressurized acid streams generated by a tank at the base of its throat. Given the extended range of this attack, firing arrows at the acid tank to disable this attack and other orange-colored components should be done as early as possible. 
Of course, acid isn’t the only weapon at the Slitherfang’s disposal. The rattle on its …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Final Fantasy XVI producer Naoki Yoshida took to Twitter for an announcement regarding the game’s development. Citing COVID-19 issues, including how remote work has had impacts on critical aspects of the game development pipeline, Yoshida explained that news about the title has been delayed out of this year and should be expected in spring 2022. 
Given that the year is almost over, the fact that this news drop fell out of 2021 shouldn’t be very surprising, and many, many games the world over have been delayed or impacted by COVID-19 in various capacities. You can check out the entirety of the messaging right here in the Tweet below!
A message from Final Fantasy XVI producer Naoki Yoshida. #FF16 #FFXVI pic.twitter.com/qtfJUUp6LA
December 27, 2021
Final Fantasy XVI has big expectations behind it, as does any numbered title in the mainline Final Fantasy series, and what we’ve seen so far has been brief. We do know it is supposed to feature an “expansive” skill tree. While there’s plenty to dig into if you want to hyper analyze small bits of trailer footage, a proper information drop has yet to occur. We’ll see what the new year brings for Final Fantasy XVI! Do you think that Final Fantasy XVI will launch in 2022? Or perhaps a more popular question, which game do you think will end up arriving first – Final Fantasy 7 Remake Part 2 or Final Fantasy XVI? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

First and least of these was Desert World, a blithe eternity of golden sand always viewed from kilometres up, where fizzing white rings rose toward me like expanding surf. I'd try to find my way down to the surface, but always at the risk of glitching straight through and ending up in Snake World, where monstrous serpents emerged from darkened kitchens.


Somewhere between these two poles lay the realm of the Animals, not that they were really animals, but clouds of eyelash-thin mandible, grot and sparkle, like rotten food on the point of becoming a school of tropical fish. I loved Animal World. I used to spend hours trying to mind-hack my way into it. I was pretty shocked to find its likeness in Sluggish Morss: Pattern Circus - an irresistibly strange, gristly, sorrowful, comical and inventive album of creatures, songs, places and phrases from Jack King-Spooner and composer Helena Celle.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After tackling Metroid in Season 1, the second season of Game Informer's Video Gameography podcast moves on to one of the biggest shooter franchises in existence: Halo. This week, we examine Bungie's blockbuster Halo 2.
Halo 2 was released on the original Xbox on November 9, 2004, and it was an even bigger success than the original. The lead-up to Halo 2 was full of anticipation, but its development was anything but easy. For the next hour as we talk about Halo's massive lore, the Arbiter's secret origins, Bungie's original grand plans for multiplayer, and how the studio was almost forced to release Halo 2 several years early.
Join hosts Ben Reeves (@BenjaminReeves), Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), and former Game Informer video editor Wade Wojcik (@WadeWojcik) as we unpack the history and impact of Master Chief's grand sequel.  And for more Halo, be sure to check out our definitive ranking of every Halo game.
Check out the rest of our podcast on the Video Gameography hub. If you'd like to get in touch with the Video Gameography podcast, you can email us at podcast@gameinformer.com. You can also join our official Game Informer Discord server by linking your Discord account to your Twitch account and subscribing to the Game Informer Twitch channel.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Book of Boba Fett arrives on Disney+ on December 29, but you don't have to wait that long to play as the feared bounty hunter in Fortnite. He was added to the store today, sporting his new look from the forthcoming streaming series.
If you purchase just the Boba skin, you'll also get his Z-6 jetpack, as well an emote where he using his targeting computer. You can also separately purchase his starship (formerly named Slave One) as a glider, and his gaffi stick as a harvesting tool. You can get everything together in a bundle should you want it all.
If you can survive a sarlacc pit, nothing’s impossible!

December 25, 2021
Boba isn't the only Star Wars character in Fortnite today. While it's a bummer he's the only new face from The Book of Boba Fett, Epic Games did bring back the previously released imperial storm trooper skin, along with a Y-Wing glider, and a dark side emote.
There's a chance more characters from this series will appear in Fortnite over time, but for now, we'll just have to use the new renter of Jabba's Palace. Unlike Fortnite's release of The Mandalorian content last year, Boba Fett's arrival doesn't add new missions or armor upgrades – it's just the skin and themed accessories.
Epic updates Fortnite's store every day with new content at 4 p.m. PT. We're still waiting for Matrix skins, which we believe will be coming after the recently added emotes and glider, but there's a chance that's all we'll get. Epic may be moving on to Star Wars and other properties in the days ahead. We'll have to wait to see what comes next.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Those who enjoy gaming have their reasons for loving the hobby. Still, one prevailing thing that keeps us coming back to keyboards and controllers is the ability of video games to take us to new worlds, introduce us to new characters, and ultimately tell us stories that stay with us long after the credits roll. Maybe someone’s looking to explore a fantasy realm to get away from what might be a more mundane setting here on Earth. Perhaps someone feels homesick and wants to visit a game world that happens to be their old stomping grounds.
Games can even take us to different time periods and seasons, too. Here are some of our favorite games that take place during the holidays.

But taking a a day or two off also means filling this website with the almighty drip of pre-written content. The wheels keep turning, no matter the day of the year, and as a lowly worker bee, I am happy to oblige the Game Informer CMS' never-ending need for listicles.

#1 Deku Tree – Why does the Deku tree outrank every other tree in gaming? Because it’s from The Legend of Zelda, and The Legend of Zelda is like the coolest thing ever. Haven’t you heard? Everything Zelda related should be ranked number one. That’s how journalism works. Also, the Deku Tree has a mustache. Double win.

#2 Teldrassil – The old world tree from World Of Warcraft is home to the Night Elves. Of course, the Night Elves suck because they are part of the Alliance, so we weren’t going to include Teldrassil. However, then we heard that sometimes stupid Night Elf noobs fall off the tree and die, so we moved this tree up to number two…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you like your RPG adventures to contain dungeons and dragons, and be as complex as Dungeons & Dragons, perhaps you might fancy the latest game being given away free in the Epic Games Store's festive sale. For 24 hours, Epic are handing out Pathfinder: Kingmaker free for keepsies. It's a vast fantasy RPG based on the Pathfinder pen 'n' paper system, played out in ye olde isometric perspective. The sort of RPG that's fascinating to some, offputting to others—so a great candidate for a freebie.

Jim Lowe's Green Door might not be a Christmas song, but it sure can feel like one—especially inside the festive action of Dracula Cha Cha. That's right, it's Christmas Eve, which means one more night without sleeping, and time to play Dracula Cha Cha.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In concept, the song “The Twelve Days of Christmas” is just a big list of amazing gifts to get your significant other for the holidays. But in practice, it’s useless! Seriously. Who has twenty different kinds of birds on their wish list, and where would you even put them all? But it’s undeniably catchy. So, we thought we’d spruce up this classic carol by replacing all those unwanted fowl with some great game-related gifts you could get your true love (or really anyone) this holiday season. Hopefully, this version will catch on soon.

They're named Takaya Kuroda & Goodfellas and they have a Christmas song out. Not only is this excellent news, I can't get over the fact it straight up sounds like Kiryu delivering some festive cheer. So get comfy, bang this on, and let Kiryu's warm tones wash over you like mulled wine.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Right now Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker is so popular you can’t buy it anymore. To prevent overcrowding and crashing servers, Square Enix have had to halt free trials and new sales to keep the game stable after an unprecedented surge in popularity this summer. Between that and the global shortage of materials to add more servers, it may be quite some time until new players are able to experience it. If you have an active subscription and manage to brave the long queues however, you’re one of the lucky few who get to experience something truly special. For everyone else: hang in there, it will be worth the wait.

If I have to. The indie games I've been playing recently all have a bit of an end-of-the-world flavour to 'em, whether literal or metaphorical or by your own hand, if you feel like it. I dunno, I actually found them strangely relaxing, as a sort of counterpoint to the chaos of my own life during the holiday season. See what you think.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The latest free game giveaway in GOG's winter sale is an unexpected one for the festive season, but perhaps a game which captures the feeling of being trapped at a seemingly endless Christmas lunch with awful relatives: I Have No Mouth And I Must Scream. Nothing says 'bad family Christmas' like being tortured for 109 years by a sentient supercomputer which nuked humanity and keeps only five people alive to torment. The 90s point 'n' click adventure game is a grim one (so grim!), but one which does have its fans.

No more NieR games for us... unless he receives a massive pile of money. Quickly, it becomes clear he's just joshing around. Another classic ruse from the man in the Emil mask, and a subtle hint that they may have something new in the works. Plus, it's just a really delightful video and you should all watch it.

Add in gameplay mechanics like puzzles, shooting, dancing, or the use of electric instruments that can be played with a group of friends, and you’ve got a genre that easily becomes a house favorite. While the music genre is not as clear-cut as it used to be – remember when it was basically “Do you want to play Guitar Hero or Rock Band?” – there are many more creative renditions of these experiences, so the scene has never been better than now. However, with the abundance of options now afforded to fans of music games, picking out the one to play can be tough. This list has you covered, though.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's always awesome when you can see your favorite pokémon tagging alongside you in the well-loved RPG. But now, some fans can recreate that feeling in real life with the new Pokémon Collection from Secretlab. The gaming chair company has given its Titan Evo 2022 Series the very best makeover, with the ergonomic seats sporting two of the franchise's most recognized mascots. One of the offerings features an adorable image of Pikachu, with yellow lettering and accents to match. The other orange-and-blue-laced option in this fresh collection is packing a Zard. Both chairs come with a pair of pokéballs stitched into the upper left corner, the creatures' pokédex number in the right, and a handful of themed, custom stitching throughout. 
But before you go off to try and snag one of these functional gaming collectibles, we have good and bad news. The bad? Secretlab's collection is only available in Japan right now while supplies last. So, it would seem like anyone outside that country is out of luck for now. However, there is a glimmer of hope as the manufacturer has provided a link on its website that will allow you to "register interest." We hope this means that – given enough people click the link and provide their email – Secretlab will consider selling these unique products around the globe. So if you'd like to get more news on the chairs and hopefully bring the Kanto-region pokémon to your region, check out the collection's official website.

        <updated>2021-12-23T19:43:46.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[New year, new Games with Gold lineup, and this upcoming month's titles all seem to have a theme. We are looking forward and backward with a slew of games that run the gamut from ultra-futuristic to retro-futuristic. Come January, Xbox owners with Xbox Live Gold membership or that subscribe to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate will be able to grab the titles listed below for free:
NeuroVoider: Available January 1 to 31
Aground: Available January 16 to February 15
Radiant Silvergun: Available January 1 to 15
Space Invaders Infinity Gene: Available January 16 to 31
As usual, the games are only available for a limited time, so make sure you catch anything you are interested in before it leaves the service. The first up on the list is NeuroVoider, a twin-shooter RPG that sets waves of robotic baddies after you. You'll have to take each of them down to end the neverending war that's been tearing up the cyber futuristic world. Coming in the same window as NeuroVoider during the first half of the month is Radiant Silvergun. The vertical scrolling shoot 'em up was first released in 1998 but has been shined up for modern players.
In the back half of the month, players will be able to pick up Aground and Space Invaders Infinity Gene. The second title, a fresh twist on the well-known Space Invaders franchise, is only available until the end of January, so pick it up as soon as you can. However, Aground, a game focused on building and crafting set amongst the stars, will be available until the middle of February. 
While the end of the year is fast approaching, we still have a little bit more time left in December. So, if you have not picked up last month's Games with Gold, you can pick those up now. This month's free titles included The Escapists 2, Tropico 5: Penultimate Edition, Orcs Must Die, and Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet. There are some good titles in there, so don't miss out if you have Xbox Live Gold or Xbox Game Pass Ultimate.
What do you think about 2022's opening Games with Gold? Let us know in the comments below.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Click here to watch embedded media
  
The new Uncharted film is only months away and we just got a brand new trailer to pick apart. Much of the footage isn't new, following the first trailer that was released back in October pretty closely. However, this new look at the upcoming adaptation does give us a few fresh tidbits, including a little more backstory on Moncada, the movie's antagonist played by Antonio Banderas. It seems, his family did more than search for the unbelievable fortune central to the story, they found it but were then betrayed. We'll have to see how this ties into Nathan Drake (played by Tom Holland) and Victor "Sully" Sullivan's (played by Mark Wahlberg) plans to recover the glittering treasure. 
One of the biggest reveals of the trailer came at the end when we get our first glimpse of Sully in the film with his characteristic mustache. In the games, Sully's facial hair is one of his defining features, and one that Uncharted fans immediately noticed was missing in early character reveals. While it felt strange to see the mentor without it, the change made some sense considering this movie takes place before the Naughty Dog series. However, it looks like Sully won't stay clean-shaven throughout the whole film, and you can check out the reveal, along with the rest of the new details in the trailer above. 
Sony Entertainment Picture's Uncharted will release in theatres on February 18. Recent posters found on Fandango showcase some pirate-worthy imagery, of which we see more in today's trailer. This led some to believe that the upcoming movie may have ties to Uncharted 4: A Theif's End, which features a graveyard of similar-looking vessels. However, it's hard to tell exactly what connections we will see between the games and the upcoming adaptation. There's only two more months until we find out.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Every long-running series has its turning points, times that demand reinvigoration and forward-thinking. Tales of Arise was Bandai Namco’s opportunity to enact meaningful change and enter a new console generation soaring. The developers didn’t let the opportunity pass by, rising to the challenge and breaking franchise sales records in the process. Tales of Arise took interesting risks and made smart improvements, resulting in a fantastic RPG full of endearing characters, intense battles, and rewarding exploration.
In its 26-year run, the Tales series has always had a passionate fanbase, but Tales of Arise helped expand the franchise’s reach and elevate its established formula to make it one of the best entries in years. While retaining the series’ essence, Bandai Namco brought in a new visual style, more strategic combat, and a mature story about warring nations. The latter especially made its mark for how it tackled socio-political issues, like racism, authoritarianism, and mental illness. Read more...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been just around two years since Telltale Games announced its return. Populated by some of the former studio's staff and led by a new team, the company announced a follow-up to The Wolf Among Us during The Game Awards 2019. Then things seemed to go quiet, leading many to speculate on how the newly reformed studio was doing. However, Telltale has recently been very vocal about the status of its projects and the studio itself. This most recent post from Telltale's official Twitter account runs down a list of the studio's recent milestones and what it hopes to achieve in the near future. It begins, "Telltale is back." Then the post moves on to assure readers that the company, while trying to stay true to the Telltale legacy, is changing things up and steering clear of the problems that plagued the original studio.
Perhaps the most eye-catching part of the message comes near the end, in the section detailing what comes next. It seems like we will be hearing more about The Wolf Among Us 2 soon. As you can read below, the post states the team will be ready to reveal more news "early next year when we can go deeper into things."
While we are excited to hear news about Telltale's upcoming sequel, the studio has more projects on the horizon. Announced just weeks ago at The Game Awards, The Expanse: A Telltale Series will be an adaptation of the popular Amazon TV show and is being co-developed with Life is Strange: True Colors studio Deck Nine. The two developers have a strong storytelling history, giving us a lot to look forward to in the title.]]></summary>

My days at work were mostly spent alone in a dark projection booth above a corporate auditorium. To spice up my evenings and force some human interaction on myself, I started playing Magic: The Gathering at a local game shop. I spent multiple days a week there, learning how to draft, build decks, and catch onto the lingo and language of the game. Slowly, I incorporated myself into the small group of regulars, and day by day, I felt less alone.
While shuffling decks and slinging spells against these new acquaintances, I noticed shared mannerisms and social archetypes people took on within my little corner of the Magic community. Let me tell you how pleasantly surprised …]]></summary>

It is a very big cave, and every night a huge colony of bats come screaming out of the entrance. They spend the day clinging to the ceiling of this big cave, and all their bat poo falls down and has become a towering heap carpeting the floor.
But then David said look, the carpet is moving. And it turns out that the whole bottom of the cave is covered in cockroaches and giant centipedes. And if ever a small baby bat or an old injured bat falls, it is eaten alive by this hoard of chittering insects. This nature documentary haunted me, for it was the worst thing I could imagine happening.
Anyway, Nate has been to that cave and he's going to tell us all about it for this episode of our supporters only podcast, The Nate Files. Thanks for being a supporter, pals!

Ever a broad church, 2021's seen enough releases to keep ten of me busy, from the easy-going Legion War to the month-consuming Shadow Empire. I don't know about you, but my personal "to play" list is out of control.
And yet, while we've had plenty to enjoy this year, it's felt like a period of build-up to something bigger. I'm not one for looking forward. If a game's not out yet it tends to disappear from my mind, making room for a hundred other recent releases in this age of plenty. That I've less interest in looking back over this year than I do pondering the next suggests that maybe we're in for something special in the coming twelve months. Or perhaps it's just been a rough one and I'm very sleep deprived and don't want to think about 2021. Either way, let's have a look at what's in store for strategy fans in 2022, yeah?

There are plenty of fantastic fighting games out there, both old and new. As Arc System Works continues to update its older Guilty Gear games with rollback netcode, those fighters are given new life. However, is there room for another fighter with recent entries in the genre, such as Guity Gear Strive, and others on the horizon like SNK's King of Fighters XV? After going hands-on with the DNF Duel beta over the past weekend, Game Informer editor John Carson thinks so. 
Game Informer editor and today's host, Wesley LeBlanc, is joined by John, AKA The King of Late Night, AKA possibly the greatest fighting game player in the world, to discuss the recent beta test. The two also talk about what makes DNF Duel different in a busy genre, where its inspirations lie, and most importantly, how it feels to play. 
In this New Gameplay Today, we also have 15 minutes of action-packed DNF Duel Beta gameplay on top of the discussion topics above. Thanks for watching, and be sure to let us know what you think of this upcoming fighting game from Eighting and Arc System Works.]]></summary>

This week's reveal focuses its sights on Electronic Arts' Star Wars Battlefront II video game from 2017. Hasbro is bringing four new action figures from the game to market. All four are Clone Troopers decked out in some of the game's unique armor coloring. Three of the figures fall into the 3 and 3/4-scale Vintage Collection, with the final one joining the Gaming Greats Black Series line.
The latter figure is the Umbra Operative Arc Trooper with a cool black and orange coloring. This clone stands at roughly six inches in height and comes with two pistols. It will be sold exclusively at GameStop with an expected ship date next April.

        <updated>2021-12-22T21:01:29.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Brandon Sanderson, the famed author behind fantasy series Mistborn and The Stormlight Archive series, has revealed he’s working on a video game. 
This news comes by way of a recent blog post he made titled “State of the Sanderson 2021,” which, like previous “State of” posts made by the author, details what he has going on in his career. He mentions feature films, TV series, and more, but he also quickly divulges that he’s been working on a game for a while and we might be seeing it soon. 
“I’ve been working on a video game for several years, and I suspect it will be announced this year,” Sanderson writes. “So commence speculation.” 
Sanderson’s post includes a note that says the game is not based on one of his properties and is instead something new he built with the team he’s working with on this project. He also said that people will recognize the company developing the game but playfully suggests it's “probably not the one you’re thinking of right now,” nor is it “that other one either.” 
And that’s all Sanderson had to say about this game. Sanderson entering the video game scene would be quite a treat for fans of the author, whose only other experience in games is minimal. He wrote a novella e-book in 2011 for Epic Games Infinity Blade series called “Infinity Blade: Awakening.” (Editor's note: he has also worked on some fiction for Magic: The Gathering. – JC) However, as the author notes that this game won’t be based on one of his own series, those holding out for a Mistborn RPG will have to continue their wait. 
Perhaps this development will go so well that Sanderson decides to greenlight a Mistborn game of some kind. While not a full game, you can technically get a taste of Mistborn in the form of a game by way of Fortnite, which recently sold a skin based on Kelsier. Be sure to check out Sanderson’s entire “State of” post for more information about what the author is up to.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In celebration of our Horizon Forbidden West cover story, which digital subscribers read now, we're letting you get a look at the new screens Guerrilla Games shared with us for the story. These shots were provided exclusively to Game Informer for our extensive 12-page feature to highlight certain aspects we discussed.
For some context for the images below, they mostly feature a new area called the Daunt, which is a canyon at the eastern edge of Sundom (Carja territory). This new settlement acts as an onboarding area to get players up to speed with the game’s new mechanics. It is Aloy's last stop before she heads to the Forbidden West. These screens also provide a view of a market and tavern to show off the more lively locales.
Lastly, there's a look at a new machine called the Burrower, which is a successor to Horizon Zero Dawn's Watcher. This common recon machine can tunnel underground and resurface in unexpected locations. When it senses danger, it emits a high-pitched sound to call allies and stun enemies.  According to game director Mathijs de Jonge: "We wanted to add even more character and locomotion to the machines in Horizon Forbidden West, so the Burrowers are very similar to otters or weasels: flexible, quick, and pretty ferocious!"

I now know the reason why and I hate to admit it. Infinite doesn’t have a battle royale mode, which I've come to realise is the perfect FPS template for gaming with my mates. Something about it just works, you know? Listen, let me explain.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know almost nothing about Alfred Hitchcock. He’s the kind of archetypal director whose work I’ve been exposed to in bits and pieces without ever actually sitting down to watch one of his films in full. All of that is to say that, upon starting Alfred Hitchcock - Vertigo the game, I was in no position to judge whether it was a faithful adaptation of the film or to recognize all but the most obvious illusions to Hitchcock’s body of work (look, birds!). That’s okay, though, because as it turns out, Vertigo is an original story based on a collage of Hitchcockian concepts, not a direct adaption of the 1958 film by the same name.
Vertigo the game follows author Ed Miller as he grapples with a debilitating case of vertigo–a condition that leaves him unable to stand as the world appears to spin around him–and paralyzing guilt over the death of his daughter and her mother, Faye, after their car falls off a bridge into a ravine below. With Ed bed ridden, it’s up to Dr. Julia Lomas, psychologist and psychiatrist, and Sheriff Nick Reyes to unravel the mystery of what really happened, and whether Faye and his daughter even exist. My thoughts on how Vertigo goes about telling this story are... complicated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello folks. It's been a funny old year, 2021. On the games side, it's often felt like a year of shifting goalposts. Games that were delayed by the pandemic last year finally got their due in 2021, but in turn many of the releases we were expecting this year have inevitably slipped into 2022. The pandemic has affected games of all sizes this year, and I don't think it will go down in the history books as one of our all-time greats. There were still plenty of fantastic games that came out this year, mind, and we're still counting down our absolute favourites over in our Advent Calendar. 
That said, I do think 2021 will prove to be a pivotal year for RPS - and not just because I stole Graham's key card and changed the locks on the front door of the Treehouse. It's been a year of immense change here at the site, so I wanted to take some time to reflect on everything that's happened this year, and look forward to what we've got in store for 2022.

Developers EggNut have announced that a new Backbone game is coming in 2022, dropping us back into the snowy, animal-filled city. We don't know much about it yet, but Backbone is an excellent detective puzzle game, and a gorgeous one at that, so I have high hopes for the next one.

Original Story: This year had us stuck in many video game time loops, but one of my absolute favourites was Loop Hero. I never thought an autobattler RPG would hook me the way it did, but I spent hours upon hours helping a little knight circle a seemingly endless void, and had a wonderful time doing it. If you didn't have a chance to play it earlier this year, it's now free on the Epic Game Store until tomorrow. I heartily encourage you to pick this one up, it's one of our favourite games of 2021.

I'd have given up on the game if it weren't so interesting. For one thing, none of those deaths were final. He died as a child and came back. He died as a teenager and came back. These were not saved games, but ordinary occurrences. It's an interesting world made infuriating by awkward design choices.

They didn't have much to say about it at the time, but last night they announced it properly. Named Nine Sols, it's an action platformer with combat inspired by Sekiro. Honestly, they still don't have much to say about it beyond that, but they have released a gorgeous poster featuring a cat-like character that you can see in full below.

Five Nights At Freddy's: Security Breach launched last night, inviting players to fend off a whole new crew of animatronics. This is the eighth mainline game in the long-running pizzeria-based horror series (I know, there are loads of spin-offs too), and for the first time it will let players properly roam free, rather than be tied to a desk monitoring cameras.

While they don't have much more than screenshots and a wee video to show right now (sorry, engine enthusiasts), they do hint that they'll release some sort of "playable demonstration of its features" at some point "soon".

Epic are also going wild with coupons again, giving a £10 (or $10) coupon on every game you buy which costs at least £13.99 (or $14.99). Given Epic's habit of paying for timed exclusives, they do have discounts on some games you'll not get elsewhere, or at least not with those vouchers.

Halo Infinite's best place is its open world, through which you can swing like a honking metal Tarzan and do sweet Warthog jumps from cliffs. But its best level, the most satisfying A-to-B gun boulevard, comes late in the campaign (spoilers ahead). The House Of Reckoning is a series of rooms where contrived artificial battlefields have been constructed inside an alien fortress. They are abstractly human structures surrounded by sand, as if your extraterrestrial enemies have been playing house but believe a homo sapiens' house looked exactly like a chunk of Normandy beach circa 1944. The narrative reasoning behind this level is absurd. But the fights that occur within are excellent.

The victor will claim the GOTY In The Bank briefcase and win the chance to compete next year as well.
Before we get to that, though, we must first discuss (at length) whether 200 t-shirts is a lot of t-shirts, what Nate is having for his Christmas dinner, what kind of cop duo would be named Halloumi & Date, and also what our favourite Christmas songs are. Nate also does a really good Mankind pun. Plus: which wrestler would be the best hugger?

The original's bombing mission sequence, which sees Cloud and co. blow up a planet-killing mako reactor in the industrialised hellhole of Midgar's city centre, was already one of the Final Fantasy series' best openers, but here we get to really luxuriate in every last detail of its twenty-four-year glow-up. Director Tetsuya Nomura may have a reputation for excess in JRPG circles (both in his tangled storylines and his passion for buckles and belts), but in FF7R that tendency toward indulgence has been applied with deadly, laser-like precision.

CDP say that the proposed settlement terms make clear that though they are paying out, this "does not imply admission of any responsibility".

More recently, Nvidia went a step further, quietly launching a brand new version of the RTX 2060 that doubles its VRAM to 12GB.


Emphasis on the “quietly”, mind – even if you’ve been regularly checking for available GPU stock or perusing our graphics cards deals guide, you probably won’t have even noticed there’s a 12GB RTX 2060 knocking around. So what’s the deal with this mysterious card, and should you even consider buying an RTX 20 series card in this day and age?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Gunk might not be the most sophisticated name in the universe for a gooey black jelly that pulses with an ominous red light, but goodness it sure is appropriate. As space haulers Rani and Becks touch down on a forgotten planet in search of a strange energy signal, the place is absolutely gummed up with the stuff. It oozes and throbs in the caves, plains and rivers of this once vibrant landscape, and the urge to suck it all up into Rani's chunky power glove (a literal hand vac in this case) is overwhelmingly strong. After all, when it turns the ground black and saps the world of all its colour, this is one case of Extremely Bad Vibes you'll want to remedy as soon as possible. 
Your reward for scooping up all the gunk in any given area is the kind of graphical wizardry video games do best. A burst of light, a shruum of sound, and the world is instantly transformed back to its former glory. Despite its gloopy namesake, The Gunk is frequently stunning, its soft pastels and coral-esque flora showing such an eye for jaw-dropping visuals that it's hard to believe this is SteamWorld developer Image & Form's first ever 3D video game. If this is what they've been holding back on all these years, then their upcoming action adventure SteamWorld Headhunter should be a real treat for the old eyeballs. That said, while Image & Form have clearly navigated their 2D to 3D transition from an art perspective, their typical flair for adding their own spin to different genres has been less successful. There's a lot to like about this 3D action platformer, but it's missing that spark to really make it sing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here I was thinking Tetris 99 was the strangest game to be turned into a battle royale, but now you can fight to the death in Scrabble too. Babble Royale is a new Scrabble-like battle royale where 16 players fight to be the last letters standing. You have to make words in such a way that you escape a zone that's closing in, and attack other players by building words off of theirs. I honestly didn't think it would work, but man, it absolutely does.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Final Fantasy XIV is suffering from success, thanks, in part, to its recently released Endwalker expansion. Despite updates to ease server errors and long queue times, players are still struggling to log into the game. So, Square Enix have only gone and done it. They've temporarily suspended sales of the game, as well as new registrations for the free trial version. Even adverts are being stopped for now.

In keeping with the series' stealth roots, the game was announced with little to no fanfare this evening via a blog post, with Ubisoft declaring its existence along with some developer chat before scampering back into the shadows. Typical.

Loco Motive is a train-based detective game published by Chucklefish (who also pubbed Stardew Valley and Starmancer), and is the debut game from developers Robust Games. There's been a murder! And it's your job to figure out who committed the crime. Classic whodunnit stuff that we'll get to play next summer.

You can grab the excellent HTC Vive Cosmos Elite VR headset kit for £649. That's £250 off the list price, as well as a return to the price that the full VR kit was going for on Black Friday.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nerves have been sufficiently jangled as of late, not least thanks to the slew of action packed games that have landed in recent months. I crave an altogether more sedate beginning to next year, and so my mind turns to games in which violence, reflex or any other kind of unblinking attentiveness takes a back seat. 
Looking for a broader mixture of games? Check out our regularly updated list of the best PC games you can play right now.
Primarily we're talking violence-free games here, but I wanted to drill a little deeper than that - so nothing that generally requires a competitive streak. I'm chasing a certain feel rather than a certain category. Flying, walking, puzzling, driving, building, dreaming, climbing, stretching, swinging (not like that), swimming, wondering: these are just a few of the ways in which flashing pixels can make you feel a very different sort of accomplishment.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I really don’t like gaming chairs. They’re expensive, often cumbersome, drastically over-designed things that lean way too heavily into the g4m3r aesthetic, and that’s coming from someone who’s built up something of a tolerance to it from years of unprotected RGB exposure. I’ve sat on them and have even shared homes with some of them, but have never, ever seen the appeal over a halfway decent office chair.


And then the Noblechairs Epic TX comes along, and it’s got me rethinking.

Sprouts will be consumed in their millions, the Great Escape snoozed through by bloated grandparents far and wide. Most importantly, gifts of roughly equivalent financial value will be exchanged to demonstrate affection and prolong the reign of capitalism.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been hands-on with Sifu, a beat ‘em up action-adventure game by Absolver developers Sloclap. My hands weren’t exactly “on”, but more “around”, actually. That’s one thing I learned from my time with this kung-fu caper. To keep my fists flowing, I needed to be patient, and not mash the buttons. Seriously, slap those buttons with zero thought and you’re dead.
Death in Sifu means you age, and if you die lots, you age faster. Hit 70 and you won’t be rising from the dirt again. Instead, you'll have to start your quest for vengeance over from the beginning. While it can be tempting to cling onto your youth for this reason alone, I actually liked growing old, with my beard and my harder-hitting attacks. Not only do you develop a relationship with your body in Sifu, but your trips to the afterlife also help you master its myriad of moves. Sifu really does get better with age.

Ubisoft are giving the 2D side-scroller away as part of their 35th anniversary celebrations, which is wonderful news.

It's creepy, surprising, and superbly fun, and now you can play the best part for as long as you please. Developer Daniel Mullins has released a "mini-expansion" in beta on Steam, which (minor spoilers ahead!) makes its animal-based card game a standalone roguelike experience. Named Kaycee's Mod, it's slightly tougher than what you might have played already, and adds new challenges too, so you can keep going back in for more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I finished watching The Game Awards reveal trailer for Rumbleverse, the new Epic-published battle royale game that looks a bit like Fortnite but with melee combat, I raised a practiced eyebrow of derision. "Well, that looks terrible," chortled I, knowing full well that I'd still give it a go at the earliest opportunity because I am an absolute sucker for battle royales.
Two things happened later that day that I did not expect. First: I got the opportunity to dive into Rumbleverse's action-packed 40-player matches far earlier than I'd anticipated, as part of a one day early look at the game. I downloaded and installed it in short order, and jumped right in. Two hours later, at 1am in the morning as the servers shut down, I happened across a second, far more unexpected thing. I found myself absolutely desperate to play more. I've sunk thousands of hours into Apex Legends, Fortnite, Plunkbat, Hunt: Showdown, Warzone, and various other behemoths of the genre. Yet those two hours I spent playing Rumbleverse might be the most fun I've ever had in a battle royale.
