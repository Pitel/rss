        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you’re a cool, cool person, you are probably already subscribed to the Destructoid Changelog Newsletter. After all, not only does it give you a weekly wrap-up of all the best features, news, and reviews from here on Destructoid, but it also comes with a near-lethal dose of yours truly. If that’s somehow not enough to convince you to sit at the popular kids’ lunch table, then maybe a chance to win a PlayStation 5 Slim will entice you.


That’s right! Sign up below to subscribe to the newsletter, and you’ll be eligible to enter the Giveaway with a chance to win a PS5 Slim. If you’re already subscribed, you still need to enter the contest below. Unless you’re under 18. Sorry, junior. You can even enter regardless of where you live in the world, except for a few spots where they don’t allow such things (“Void where prohibited by law,” in case a lawyer is listening.) The full terms and conditions can be found in the embed below.



  PS5 Slim Edition




That’s all there is to it. If you’re subscribed, you can enter to win a PlayStation 5 Slim. If you’re not subscribed, you should subscribe so you can enter.


I mean, as if you needed further incentive to sign up for an already awesome newsletter, right? Each Friday, you’ll get the quick deets on what went on over the week, focusing on the weird and the retro, as well as a blurb about what weird thing I was using to occupy my time (like Steel Battalion or Bio Warrior Dan). It’s your own extra dose of Destructoid. Plus, if you refer a friend using a special link given in each newsletter, you can get in on our monthly special edition, where I interview some rad developers. Folks like Ben Cocuzza from Puppet Combo, Jack King-Spooner of Judero fame, and TheCatamites, creator of Anthology of the Killer. There’s no reason not to sign up, and now you might even win a PlayStation 5 Slim.

The very secret goal of the column is for the guests to name every book ever written. It's a task every single one has failed miserably at with two notable exceptions. One was Dan Griliopoulos, who listed 400 books in a document before he got bored and gave up - a heroic, if ultimately futile effort. The other was Warren Spector back in November, who not only gave me the longest and most detailed reply I'd had before or since, but also followed up several times to add more books to the list.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Alexander Isak Premier League POTM SBC is now live in EA FC 25, and you can complete the challenge to unlock a special card in Ultimate Team.


Isak has been voted as the best player for the month of December in the Premier League, and EA Sports has released the special card to celebrate his achievements. The price of completing the SBC is pretty low, and so are the requirements.


But is the SBC worth completing right ahead of TOTY? Let's find out.


EA FC 25 Alexander Isak Premier League POTM SBC tasks


The Alexander Isak Premier League POTM SBC has three tasks, and here are the requirements. 


Task 1 - Premier League



Min. 1 Players from: Premier League


Min. Team Rating: 84



Task 2 - Top Form



Min. 1 Players: Team of the Week


Min. Team Rating: 84



Task 3 - 85-Rated Squad



Min. Team Rating: 85



EA FC 25 Alexander Isak Premier League POTM SBC solutions


Here's a set of solutions you can use to obtain the new Isak item.


Task 1 - Premier League



Any 10 84-rated items


Gakpo 83



Task 2 - Top Form



Any 10 84-rated items


Any 83-rated TOTW item



Task 3 - 85-Rated Squad



Vitinha 85


Alex Remiro 84


Carvajal 86


Ruben Dias 88


Gavi 83


Buchanan 84


Guirassy 84


Gakpo 83


Benzema 86


Grealish 84


Nkunku 84



The new Isak item has some strengths and some weaknesses. It's 87 Pace is slightly low, but the 88 Shooting combines well with the 5* Weak Foot. Trivela+ isn't one of my preferred playstyles, but he also offers Rapid, Finesse Shot, Power Shot, and Technical. The 75 Passing is a major let down, but 91 Dribbling is certainly a big advantage. 


If you have the surplus fodder, you can consider completing the challenge. Eventually, he can be improved in a future evolution as well. The SBC isn't a bad shout, especially for a combined price of around 90,000 coins, but it could have been so much better.

You'll need to link to a PlayStation Network account to play The Last Of Us Part II on PC, say Sony. The requirement was reported by Video Games Chronicle, and sure enough, the Steam page for the "Remastered" version of the third-person fungus fighter includes a footnote in the game description that confirms it in plain language - "Account for PlayStation Network required". For a lot of people this is a minor nuisance, for others it more likely means that the game won't be on sale in your country at all. Sony's reasons for enforcing the requirement remain obscure.

But where do they end up? And do you get a choice in the matter?


In the six years I’ve been playing FFXIV, I’ve amassed thousands of screenshots. I have more photos of my Miqote than I have of myself in real life, and I’ve even ended up with an external hard drive dedicated to storing online memories. Even the beginning of my relationship with my now-fiancé, who I met while playing, is chronicled through screenshots—a surprisingly common occurrence.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Overflowing Palettes are a brand new type of puzzle found throughout all of Wuthering Waves 2.0, and they can be quite tricky to solve. If you're having trouble with them, here are a few tips and tricks you can use to get yourself closer to the solution.


How to Complete Overflowing Palettes in Wuthering Waves


Overflowing Palette puzzles can be difficult to solve because the solution to them is not always obvious. More often than not, the color you need to switch all the blocks to is not the color you want to start using immediately. In most cases, the objective color is the last one you want to use after you've prepared all the other blocks to swap to that color.


The best way to approach these puzzles is with a focus on connectivity. Blocks are only recolored if they are, in some way, connected to each other. Since you only have two to three moves you can make, it is important to recognize how you can connect disconnected blocks in as few moves as possible.

You're aiming to connect everything together, in an Overflowing Palette puzzle, so that you can change all the disconnected blocks into one connected color. When everything is connected and colored, the puzzle becomes significantly easier to decipher because you know exactly which blocks will have their color altered when you aim to paint another color over them.


Another key aspect of this puzzle is reducing the number of colors in the puzzle itself. The more blocks of a different color present, the more difficult these puzzles are to finish. Ideally, this is your primary goal over everything else initially, and it ties in directly to what I mentioned earlier about coloring disconnected blocks. 


These tips will help you solve every single Overflowing Palette puzzle available in Wuthering Waves 2.0, as they all follow the same core aspect of color control and connectivity.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Robot Arm is a very specific item you can find in Anime Last Stand, but it's also important to obtain if you're looking to evolve the Ninja character inspired by Nagato.


This item is specifically required for this one purpose, but it can be hard to obtain. Let's take a look at the best way to farm a Robot Arm in Anime Last Stand, followed by how to use it properly and efficiently.


How to get Robot Arms in Anime Last Stand


As of writing, there's only one way to get this particular item, and it's not even easy. You'll have to complete Stage 6 of the Leaf Village raid in Anime Last Stand, which is easier said than done. If you thought that managing to complete this stage and the raid was difficult, there's more bad news.


Once you complete the raid, there is a 3% chance for you to get Robot Arm, which is really low. Thankfully, there's a pity system that ensures that the probability increases in your favor if you don't obtain it. Once you clear this raid for the 30th time, you'll be guaranteed a Robot Arm from the drop. Of course, repeating the same activity 30 times can be tiring, but you're at least assured of the resource you're looking for.




How to use Robot Arms in Anime Last Stand


The Robot Arm is required when you want to evolve the Almighty Ninja (Paths) character. Evolving him will transform him into his Resurrected form, which is far more powerful than his Paths form. Both forms might be of Ultimate rarity, but Almighty Ninja (Ressurected) is on a different level.


Hence, it's certainly worth putting in the effort to get a Robot Arm, even if the task might be quite hard to complete.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you're someone just getting started in Dig It, applying mutations on your valuables could help you to get extra cash.


The core objective of the game is to use your Shovel to find valuables buried in the ground. While you can become wealthy by targeting more precious resources, you can also improve how much you get from the more ordinary ones. This can be done with the help of mutations, which makes it easier for you to get in-game money.


All Mutations in Dig It


Put very simply, mutations increase the value of any item you can dig from the terrain with your Shovel. To use mutations, you'll have to appraise the object that you want to sell and improve its valuation. Here's the full set of all ten options available inside the game.


Mutations
Multiplier




Wooden
x1.1


Rusty
x1.15


Hot 
x1.25


Biodegradable 
x1.5


Festive
x1.5


Golden
x2


Neon
x2


Holy
x3


Magma
x3


Quantum
x5






How to appraise in Dig It


The main issue with mutations is their random nature, as you can't predetermine which one you want on an object. To apply mutations, you'll have to appraise an object at Nookville Island. Go to the Central Junkyard and select the object you want to appraise.


Pay the required money, and the object will be thrown in a pit and then returned with a mutation. Remember that there are chances for it to return without any mutation as well, so make sure that you have extra cash in your inventory. If you're trying for Quantum, Magma, or Holy mutations, make sure to pray for extra luck.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Halo events are always the most prestigious content in Royale High, and they offer the best rewards you can get.


To make matters even more interesting, these events run throughout the year. The latest one has begun as the Everfriend 2025 Halo, and we have already figured out the rewards for some of the story content. There's an expiry date to the event, however, and a new one will replace it in the future.


When does the next Royale High Halo event begin?


The exact date of the next Royale High Halo event remains unknown. If I had to guess, the start of April 2025 could be a contender. Typically, there is a pattern behind how the Halo events take place.



Summer Halos usually come out in June


Fall Halos usually come out in October


Winter Halos usually come out in November/December


Everfriend Halos usually comes out in February


Spring Halos usually come out in April



We got the Glitterfrost Halo event on November 2, 2024, which was the winter Halo. The Everfriend Halo should have appeared in February, but it went live on January 6. This makes it quite possible for the Spring Halo to be pushed out in March 2025. That said, I still believe the first week of April is a likelier release date.




The developers have made a few changes to the usual pattern when it comes to the usual release pattern. Here's a list of all the Royale High Halo events since the start of 2023.



Starlight Halo Flowering 2023 (January 30)


Solarix Halo Tidalglow 2023 (June 1)


Dark Fairy Halo Eveningfall 2023 (October 16)


Frosty Fortitude Halo Glitterfrost 2023 (December 2)


Divine Adoration Everfriend Halo 2024 (January 30)


Spring Halo 2024 (April 10)


Summer Halo 2024 (June 7)


Eveningfall Halo 2024 (September 1)


Glitterfrost Halo 2024 (November 2)


Everfriend Halo 2025 (January 6)



While you wait for the next one, make sure to complete all your wishes in the ongoing Harmonic Hearts stories to unlock all the available rewards.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are many sought-after glamour items in Final Fantasy XIV, and while most of them can be obtained by spending Gil on the Marketboard, some can only be gained by completing certain quests. One such set is the Yakaku set, including the lovely Yakaku Dogi. 


The Yakaku Dogi is a casual, loose-fitting, martial arts-style top that falls from one shoulder, revealing a default blossom tattoo on the bare arm. It’s a level one piece, meaning it can be worn by any race, class, or gender regardless of character level. For that reason, it’s one of the more popular items in FFXIV, but how to get it?

Originally scheduled for a November 2024 release date, the game was pushed to February 2025. Today, Ubisoft announced that Assassin's Creed Shadows will be ready (for real) on March 20, 2025.


Following the first delay, Ubisoft called the game "feature complete," citing issues with the launch of Star Wars Outlaws as the reason for continued development. The company seemed certain about the new date at the time. As reported by VGC, Ubisoft's chief corporate finance officer, Frédérick Duguet, said the game was "close to being launched" and will "come on time with great quality."

We still don't have a precise release date for this one just yet, though the above reveal trailer showcases some of the mucky locales that we'll be a-scrubbing when it does arrive.

Now, publisher Stonemaier Games is taking us from the skies above to the depths of the oceans in its latest board game, Finspan. Whereas Wingspan focused on birds, this sequel will instead introduce us to 135 species of fish, all of which have distinct abilities and features. Various aspects of Wingspan’s gameplay, such as laying eggs, tracking round-based achievements, and playing cards in one of three territories, will return in this underwater adventure. However, there are several interesting differences besides the theme that will make diving into Finspan a unique, original experience.

Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp Complete is a great, fully-featured game all on its own. All of the paid currencies have been removed, and now it's a flat price like a normal video game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a surprising twist, it now appears that there will be a NumeroFUT promo Team 2 coming soon to EA FC 25 Ultimate Team, and we will be getting a fresh set of campaign cards very soon.


If rumors are to be believed, a second team of special cards will be released on January 10. This team will directly add to the pool of Team 1 cards that have been in packs since January 3. EA Sports has obviously stayed tight-lipped about the cards coming to the second team.


Thankfully, we have already seen a few cards leaked on social media.


All NumeroFUT Team 2 players in EA FC 25 (Leaks)


If you believe the rumors, Team 2 will have cards from three positions: LB, RM, and GK. We have already received plenty of special cards from the NumeroFUT promo over the last week, and the following items are going to be added very soon to packs.



Eder Militao LB 91


Griezmann RM 92


Balde LB 90


Yan Couto


Gabriel Martinelli


Kyle Walker


Cuadrado RM 90


Trapp GK 90


Alisson GK 91


Alex Remiro GK 90


Pickford GK 90


Endler GK 90


Naz RM 89


Anton LB 89


Juanmi RM 87


Ikatura LB 87


Van Der Hoorn LB 86


Gabriel Strefezza RM 86



I am sure we will get more leaks as we get closer to the release on Friday, January 10. Team 2 is also reportedly going to have a mini-release, which will likely be added on January 11 or 12.NumeroFUT cards are in packs until Tuesday, January 14, when the TOTY warm-up begins. This is based on the official event calendar revealed by EA Sports at the start of the NumeroFUT promo.


If you want to maximize your chances of packing a promo item, you should wait until tomorrow when Team 2 of the NumeroFUT promo players are added to the packs. Some of the upcoming items are expected to be released as part of SBCs, so make sure to be on the lookout for them. The current promo has given us some bargain SBCs to complete, with Matteo Guendouzi being the latest.

How are we coping, nine days into the year of the Switch 2? It's been an utter onslaught of leaks and rumours and noise as everyone clamours to find out about Nintendo's to-be-officially-announced console. C'mon Nintendo, it's really time to say something.
Anyway, let's cut through the noise for a second. Here at Nintendo Life, some of us have been asking a big question — literally — about the Switch 2. We've been having a bit of a debate in the office: Is the Switch 2 going to be a bit too big for a portable?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[2024 is already looking to be an interesting year for gaming, with several remakes and remasters arriving in early January and brand-new releases making the waves later on. 2023 was an exciting time, gaming in 2024 was slightly underwhelming, and it's only a matter of time before we learn what 2025 entails.


It is very easy to forget the sheer volume of games that launch throughout an entire year. One month alone can have dozens of releases, let alone the rest as game development teams announce their plans. 


If you’re looking to plan ahead or tell others about an upcoming release, we have a complete list of games confirmed to launch in 2025. We’ll also continue updating this list as we learn about new releases and delays.

It turns out you can turn off a lot of the gore and nudity. You can also swaddle yourself in some nice, sturdy, PG-13 body armor. But you're seemingly stuck with a certain base percentage of bulging, softcore gratuitousness in both the character portrait on bottom left, and in the mildly boobulent background art of the world. I'm not sure I can put up with all that, which is a shame, because Beyond Citadel is otherwise a promising, eerie FPS that mixes ideas from 90s shooters in pretty appealing ways.

When Nintendo released the 3DS, it equipped all new game cartridges with a plastic nub, preventing them from being inserted into your classic clamshell. Why are we bringing this up as 'Switch 2' leaks reach fever pitch? Because accessory manufacturer Genki (the talk of the town this week) has claimed that a similar 'indentation' approach has been used to keep people from squeezing their new console into a 'Switch 1' dock (thanks, IGN).
In case you haven't graced the internet in the past 48 hours, Genki has taken this year's Consumer Electronics Show (CES) by storm, showcasing its upcoming accessories via a "Switch 2 replica". This model, which is allegedly based on the real thing and appears very much in line with what every other leak has suggested, has given us our best look yet at what 'Switch 2' might be (remember, Nintendo is still yet to officially reveal anything). What's more, the accessory manufacturer has been answering questions about it.

Now, though, I am going through a different phase. A less blessed phase. One where I watched the popular streamer and influencer Ludwig attempt to climb to Platinum rank in League Of Legends, all because he wanted to prove another popular streamer, who thought he couldn't do it, wrong. I know I've already put you off, so I don't blame you if you stop reading. Just know that I couldn't stop watching his streams, even as it conjured up terrible memories of a time spent doing the exact same thing at uni.

Accessory manufacturer Genki has well and truly stuck its middle finger up to Nintendo in recent days, opting to openly showcase its planned accessories for the as-yet unannounced 'Switch 2' during CES 2025.
Now, in a new interview with The Verge, Genki's co-founder and CEO Eddie Tsai divulged a few more details regarding the console itself, including the new magnetic Joy-Con controllers. According to Tsai, pressing the release buttons on the back of the Joy-Con causes a small pin to protrude from the side of the Joy-Con, thus pushing it away from the main body enough to break the magnetic connection.

This is a warning to all those who are yet to play Emio - The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club and want to work through the mystery unspoiled: do not watch Nintendo's latest trailer for the game.
Yesterday, Nintendo uploaded a new trailer for the 2024 mystery entitled 'What Lies in the Past' (we've linked it in that last sentence but won't be embedding it for obvious reasons). It's an innocent-looking title and, without any form of warning at the start, bar the age certification the Nintendo of America upload, you would be forgiven for thinking it's just another promo. Perhaps, at a stretch, the reveal of some upcoming DLC. But no, it's actually loaded with late-game content that you might want to avoid.

Yep, while our friends across the pond landed plastic figurines of Sonic and co. to mark the arrival of the third movie, UK Happy Meals instead get a range of fabric balls with the faces of Sonic, Tails, Knuckles or Shadow emblazoned on the front. There are also some, uhh, Super variants of select characters, but we won't get into that here.

If you've been browsing social media for the past few days (heck, let's not kid ourselves, past few years) you'll have seen plenty of prognosticating about the arrival of the Switch successor.
The latest whispers suggested that Wednesday 8th January was the first sensible day after the holidays for Nintendo to finally pull back the curtain on 'Switch 2'. With everyone across all territories back in the office, it made sense to put all the rumours to bed with an official reveal in early January.

Here's one for the alliteration fans out there: Super Rare Games has announced that it's bringing snekflat's weird and wonderful exploration game Tiny Terry's Turbo Trip to Switch on 13th February. Terrific!
This one launched on Steam last year and has since gone on to rack up hundreds of 'Overwhelmingly Positive' reviews. In it, you play as Terry, a wobbly little guy who dreams of nothing more than launching himself into space in a car of his own invention (we've all been there). To do so, Terry explores the town of Sprankelwater, chatting with locals, getting into scrapes, catching bugs and collecting 'TURBO JUNK' to make his dreams a reality.

G.rev, the Japanese developer behind various shoot 'em ups like Kokuga and Border Down, has announced that it is bringing yet another rare arcade shooter to the Switch as Strania -The Stella Machina- EX lands digitally on the Nintendo hybrid on 23rd January.
Originally released on Xbox 360 and in arcades by exA-Arcadia (on its ROM cart-based system, which allows owners to put up to four games on a single cabinet) Strania -The Stella Machina- is your standard shoot 'em up affair, where you'll take to a giant mech to fight in an intergalactic war. The catch is that you get to choose which side you fight on, so you can take up arms for the goodies or the baddies.

Currently on show at CES 2025, it’s a prototype desktop build that uses clever geometry and an unconventional motherboard I/O layout to hide practically every single wire in the joint, for a clean design that's housed for your viewing pleasure within a four-sided glass chamber. It’s the closest PCs have come to the simple Victorian pleasures of a nice terrarium, and honestly, good on it.
The problem is that if Project Zero X’s components ever actually go on sale, there becomes a non-zero percent chance that I will come into possession of that see-through case. And there is a one hundred percent chance I will ruin it.

It really is high time we gave the new game some attention, then. The very first alpha launches into Steam early access on January 27th. Here’s what’s in store.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Free from Vita jail.
Like Nintendo’s own Wii U, the PS Vita has seen a good chunk of its best games migrate to alternative platforms in the years since the system itself veered into the realm of ‘commercial failure’. One of those games is Freedom Wars, a third-person action title created by Dimps that, at the time, was one of the most successful first-party-published Vita games (in Japan, at least). Now, over 10 years later, publisher Bandai Namco has taken the reins to present a remaster for Switch, retaining much of the original’s essence while improving upon the core gameplay.
Freedom Wars Remastered is, at its core, a loose take on Monster Hunter’s gameplay. As a Sinner within an underground Panopticon city, you must complete combat ops. Y’see, in a world in which resources are exceptionally scarce, the very nature of existence is in itself a crime; hence, you begin the game with a rather harsh one million-year sentence. By completing operations and rescuing your fellow citizens from large creatures known as Abductors, you can reduce your sentence and gain entitlements along the way.

Fortunately, thanks to some steep Black Friday sales last year, the VR Headset is enjoying a small second wind of attention. If you’re among the new PlayStation VR2 owners, you might feel…

Santa ignored all my letters asking for 2025 to be a year when no new videogames came out so I could catch up on everything I missed from the past several years. In fact, it seems like maybe someone else might have sent him a letter asking for there to be more big games coming than ever.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last year’s annual CPU tug-of-war was cleanly won by AMD, its obscenely fast Ryzen 7 9800X3D almost singlehandedly leaving Intel and their Core Ultra chips in a heap of mud and P.E.-spec rope. Coming soon to press that advantage are the Ryzen 9 9950X3D and Ryzen 9 9900X3D, a pair of even higher-spec processors that headlined AMD’s plethora of CES 2025 hardware announcements.
No pricing (or exact release date) on these yet, but they both up the core and thread counts over the 9800X3D while peaking at higher boost clock speeds. And, of course, they share the same 3D V-Cache design that makes the 9800X3D such a superlative CPU in the first place. If you don’t know what this is and how it helps game performance, imagine how much faster you could eat Wotsits if you had a massive bucket of them on your desk at all times, instead of having to get up and walk to the kitchen to grab individual packs. In this case the Wotsits are data, the bucket is 3D V-Cache, and the hastened ruination of your digestive system is games running faster.

The list in question is part of a strategy of counteracting what the US sees as the close relationship between China's armed forces and various civilian technology suppliers and research projects.
At the time of publication yesterday, a Tencent spokesperson had commented that the listing was based on a "misunderstanding". In a statement sent to RPS overnight and also published online, Tencent's chairman Ma Huateng and executive board have now said that they're prepared to get legal if the misunderstanding isn't resolved.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last night, at CES 2025, Nvidia finally announced their RTX 50 series graphics cards, and can I just say that I am wise to the RTX 5090’s tricks. A GPU that eats up to 575W and costs £1939 / $1999? Yeah, nice try, Geoffrey N. Vidia, but such a mad card couldn’t possibly exist in reality. It’s clearly only here to make the other ones, the RTX 5080, RTX 5070 Ti, and RTX 5070, look like better deals.

The setup here is that you're stuck in a tabletop underworld with a bunch of elder gods, or Dread Deities. As Custodian of this dusty funereal expanse, you must place structures on tiles around your throne room, striving to fulfil the desires of whichever Dread Deity is in play, while fending off pernicious attackers from the realm of light. Here's a trailer.

The development of 2020 FPS Call Of Duty: Black Ops Cold War cost $700 million, making it the most expensive video game project yet reported. That’s according to a court filing reviewed by Stephen Totilo’s Game File (paywalled) in which Call Of Duty creative head Patrick Kelly divulged the budgets of three games in the series.

Yet that's the challenge taken up yesterday by speedrunners at Awesome Games Done Quick. The UFO 50 speedrun includes an impressive dart through the retro collection's most bewildering game, the ancient and mysterious Barbuta, in which your character is a frustratingly slow hero with a fearfully short attack range. They managed to complete it in less than five minutes. Not only does the run (and its helpful commentary) serve as a short and sweet explanation of why Barbuta is so glitchily fascinating, it also left plenty of time to marathon another three games from the collection.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gentle reader, I have previously written exactly two boob-related articles in my life. One was a cheesy round-up of the best manboobs in video games for Green Man Gaming's long-vanished blog. It was published sometime in 2010, and IIRC, pre-reboot Kratos came out on top. I think/hope it still exists somewhere in the apparatus of Green Man Gaming, hidden beneath the retailer's veneer of respectability like a barrel of radioactive waste. The other boob article was a piece for OXM about Ken Levine saying that he wished people would stop fixating on Elizabeth's cleavage in Bioshock Infinite - a complaint we might consider slightly hypocritical, given the character's visual design.
Now it's time for boob article number 3: some modder has given 122 of the 150 Jokers in cardgame Balatro big chests. This extends from visibly human Jokers to Joker concepts that shouldn't, strictly speaking, have the capacity for boobage. The banana card has boobs, for example. The credit card card has boobs. Behold.

Mass Effect 3 tried voice commands. Socom U.S Navy Seals shipped with a headset. "Dunno if I wanna be shouting out tacticool commands in my living room," wrote a Redditor on the subject four years ago, speaking to my very soul in the process. "Gimme the clunky buttons instead".
Thankfully, you can also use your keyboard to interrogate suspects in murder mystery Dead Meat. It’s a moody, slightly goofy noir puzzler that lets you ask anything you want. Whether this means you’ll always get a worthwhile response, I’m not sure. "Want to discuss their alibi? Probe them on the meaning of life? Confess your love? Or just troll them mercilessly? Your words hold power, and anything goes," reads the Steam page. Here’s a trailer.

Those eventually grew into their PCIe shoes, but only after months of dial-shifting driver updates – whereas the flagship B580 promises Nvidia-besting games performance from the off. Even at such a stage in the current graphics generation (the GeForce RTX 5090 and RTX 5080 could be revealed literally tonight, at CES 2025), there is something enticing about that proposition.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The last time I wrote about Sonic fangame, I innocently and absent-mindedly described it as "SNES-style". This led to a social media dog-pile of an intensity typically reserved for major international banks accidentally tweeting rule34, a howl of derision that washed over me again and again while I rolled around on the floor beneath my desk, caterwauling at Graham to please please delete the whole internet, I want to start all over again. 
Let's see if we fare better this time round: Sonic Galactic is an absurdly accomplished Sonic fangame from Starteam that, broadly, imagines how the Mega Drive and Genesis platformers might have looked and felt had they been made for the Sega Saturn. There's a new demo, if you fancy trying it for yourself. Please find it here on Itch.io. Perhaps if I'd put the download link higher up the page in the other article, people would have got distracted and refrained from dunking on me so awfully.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[An upcoming life sim which claims to be a competitor to Grand Theft Auto VI is continuing to amass followers and wishlists on Steam, despite the game being unmasked as a vehicle for a dodgy cryptocurrency. Paradise is marketed as a third-person game set in a sunny modern city, where you can speak to any NPC via microphone on the street and get stilted responses powered by artificial intelligence. You will supposedly drive sports cars, shoot guns at people, and accrue in-game cash. But its more outlandish claims attracted immediate scrutiny from video creators who found countless inconsistencies in the marketing material. The game has since been removed from the Epic Games Store, presumably for breaking many of the store's rules. But it's still on Steam, and somehow clambering steadily up the wishlist ladder in defiance of its many red flags.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Original Fallout designer Tim Cain, also known for co-directing The Outer Worlds at Obsidian, has published a video responding to a player's question about why violence is the "default" path in so many big budget RPGs. That's specifically RPGs with "AAA" budgets, whatever AAA means these days. Cain is, of course, well aware that there are many RPGs from smaller teams that "evolve past the paradigm of violence being the default way in which the player interacts with the world", and that there are plenty of puzzle games, adventure games and the like in which there is no violence at all.

It is, like Dark Souls, a game about equipment and stamina management, but it finds most success as a soulslike in the sensation that you are alone somewhere bad, not able to do very much except hit horrible things in the space between them trying to hit you. It also offers notable moments of lonely, loud footsteps rebounding off cold stone tiles in the seconds after felling some giant man-bastard - one of the subgenre’s greatest un-joys.

November was a little rosier for the abandoned multiplayer game, with a monthly peak of 1,028. Then, on New Year’s Day, that number jumped to 11,900 players on Steam - its second highest concurrent besides launch. Soon after, they vanished. Who were these mysterious shufflers, flocking to the deserted, echoing halls of Valve’s disastrous flop like your mate who uses the word ‘liminal’ too much to a dead shopping center? Forbes, who first reported on the phenomena, don’t know. No one knows. Somebody might actually know but writing ‘no one knows’ makes it more dramatic. Let’s dig in.

The peals of celebration travel outward through our atmosphere, exiting the realm of Earthly sound and resonating with interstellar plasma and detritus to form a delicate ripple of comet flakes and stray photons, expanding far beyond our solar system. Where the ripple encounters larger masses, such as planets, suns and... other things, it rebounds, riding the weft of stardust back down to Earth. As it returns home, the signal is modified. Tinkered with. It acquires unsettling harmonics and a guttural undertow. By the time it re-enters our atmosphere, it has condensed to three words, which descend and shrink and spiral into your ear like an octopus entering a crevice: FEED THE MAW.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello reader who is also a reader, and welcome back to Booked For The Week - our regular Sunday chat with a selection of cool industry folks about books! The longest novel ever written is generally agreed to be Proust’s Remembrance of Things Past - a coward’s pick, since it’s actually 13 different volumes. Don’t let Proust’s despicable lies sully the joy of literature for you, though. He did have a good quality moustache - a far more important literary trait than actually doing any writing, imo.
This week, it’s ITU Copenhagen Games Professor and Broken Rules co-founder, Martin Pichlmair! Cheers Martin! Mind if we have a nose at your bookshelf?

S úctou a upřímnou pokorou jsem přistoupil k aranžmá národní slovenské hymny "Nad Tatrou sa blýská" již v roce 2016. Hudebně vychází z původní lidové písně a již dávno zažité sestupné basové linky původně inspirované čardášem. V monumentální instrumentaci zaznívá důstojné a bohaté "hradní" Maestoso s výraznou smyčcovou figurací a dramatické Presto s vypjatým protihlasem tak kontrastně jako dunajské nížiny a Vysoké Tatry. Důvodem vzniku bylo hledání krásy a síly slovenské hudby s duchovním nadhledem mně tolik blízké mahlerovské angažovanosti. Velmi důležitá při tom pro mě byla noblesa a hudební kultivovanost při zachování původní písně. Nový rozměr je u mě h…]]></summary>

Developers NetEase had recently doled out bans of up to 100 years to players they suspected of cheating, but in their eagerness, failed to distinguish between legitimate compatibility layers – the software that non-Windows operating systems, like the Steam Deck’s SteamOS, use to run native Windows games – and actual hacks. Per IGN, NetEase have now apologised to the affected players, and lifted the bans.

As a concept, at least, SpaceCraft seems both flavourless and oddly inclined to overplay its own familiarity. I mean, look at that title. Consider its chilly blend of functionality and punmanship. Look at that capital "C", poking out of the middle like the bow on a present whose silhouette leaves nothing to the imagination. You already know broadly what this game involves, yes? Indeed, you do: it's a game about crafting spacecraft, so that you can travel to other planets and craft their resources into other, better spacecraft. This you may do eternally, for there are thousands of planets in store.

I’m busy replaying The Suffering 2 for the sixth time to see a new 15 second cutscene that recognises which combination of morally aligned beginnings and endings I’ve picked. It reads your save from the first game and everything!". Say ‘memory card’ to a youthful, broccoli-maned Fortnite enjoyer nowadays. Go on, I dare you. You’ll be in a home before you know it.
Still, having new toys at regular intervals is one real upshot of our new live-service barrage of ephemeral novelty, perpetually flung at my dizzy eyeballs like gleaming carnival daggers at exhausted spinning wheels. Especially if they’re for the exquisite strategy of Mechabellum. Season 2 released yesterday alongside patch 1.2, bringing with it a new unit and specialist, some reworks, and lots of cosmetic bits I pretend not to care about but then get excited when I unlock a new one.

The concept for Judas is that you're trapped in a computer-run society housed aboard a colony ship, the Mayflower. The titular Judas has managed to break free of the AI-groomed status quo, and is out to start a revolution. "Bioshock Infinite in space", we called it, back in 2022, but Levine says it's more open-ended than either of his Bioshock endeavours, with a greater emphasis on other characters remembering and responding to your actions over time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I think the last time I read an actual, original Garfield comic was in 1998. Since then, my experience of the character has been one long litany of Gar-memes and in particular, Gorefield memes. For those blissfully unaware, Gorefield is a version of Jim Davis’s otiose, lasagna-loving housecat who has broken his comic strip shackles and become a cosmic abomination. Gorefield's manifestations are many: centipede Gorefields, arachnid Gorefields, Gorefields that extend serpentine necks of unfleshed bone towards a cowering Jon Arbuckle, demanding to be fed in a voice that sounds nothing like Bill Murray, a voice as deep and velvety as the eternal Monday before the Big Bang.
In Gar-Type, a free Gorefield fangame from Youtuber and pixel artist LumpyTouch, Garfield has become a planet. The good news is that, unlike many other Gore-variants, this Gorefield is vulnerable to bullets. It falls to ace pilot Jon Starbuckle and his prototype starfighter, Gar-Type D, to save the Earth from lasagnnihilation.

They knew that the player could never truly be Indiana Jones, but they could be allowed to make a pretend man who sounded at least 83% like Indiana Jones do things with his hands that very much resemble the sort of things Indiana Jones might do.

The project is called "Artemis" (at least for now) and you won't be seeing it any time soon. That's because the studio is still working on the tech behind it all, and plans to release two other games before it. Meaning it'll be 10-15 years before it actually comes out. 
Greene describes Artemis as an internet-like platform where users create and share things, but doesn't say specifically what those things might be. He doesn't know how his user-led "multiverse of worlds" will be moderated, or how it will prevent copyright infringement, or what makes this idea distinct from, say, Roblox. He is nonetheless "full of confidence".

It's like scrutinising a Hitman level from above, except that all of these people have evolving relationships and sleeping patterns and they might hunt you down if you murder any of their relatives. Me, I just want to play Where's Wally.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What difficulty are you on, Doom CAPTCHA? I want to know because I need to know how bad to feel about myself. Six times I’ve tried to pass your FPS test by killing three monsters to prove I’m human. Six times I’ve failed. For thousands of years, people have asked what it means to be human. It turns out it was never a philosophical issue after all. It was, I’m gutted to report, a skill issue all along.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In 2022, a group of Israel-based TV companies obtained a court order in the U.S. It compelled every ISP in the country to block three resilient pirate sites that blocking in Israel had failed to stop. Intervention by Cloudflare ended that dream and 2.5 years later, despite other measures targeting the sites, it appears that at least one is still going strong. The TV companies are now taking legal action against UK ISPs; they're unlikely to put up a fight, they may not even turn up in court.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ekphrasis is a concept from ancient Greece (who bloody loved a good concept) describing the act of creative writing inspired by a work of art. Is a Ryanair Boeing 737 safety manual art? Well, Johnson A Plane Man has done some ekphrasis with it, so I say yes. It’s a short browser Itch game that chronicles the life and times of a man named Johnson, his love for yellow life vests, his existential feelings of confinement (despite the high number of easily locatable exits), and such emancipatory joys that can only be found in yellow slides.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Happy new year all! And what better way to kick off another undignified 12 month crawl toward the next Xmas holiday than with the news that one of my favourite dark fantasy storybook extravaganzas, Ghost Of A Tale, is getting a sequel.
The newness of this news is in question, admittedly. Developer Lionel "Seith" Gallat and his team have been working on another helping of haunted mouseketeering since 2022. But this is the first time they've properly blogged about it, sharing details of a gruelling switchover to Unreal Engine 5 and a couple of new screens. They still haven't updated the title to make the obvious pun, but perhaps a title as pungent with whimsy as "Ghost Of A Tail" is beyond the trumpeted capabilities of Unreal Engine 5.

Throughout the year, the system has primarily targeted the domains and IP addresses used by pirate IPTV providers to stream illegal content. Official data made available to the public is limited but with help from data provided by an anonymous source, we can identify key trends from a very controversial year.

Two of them didn't come out this year, which is an easy disqualification, but the reality is that I also don't think any of them truly deserve a place in one of those hallowed chambers.

Yet all three are games that in some way defined my year, and I feel affection for each of them. Let me explain why.

Or at least, it was middling for my own personal taste, which is quite unsavoury at the best of times. Most of my best picks made it into the calendar proper, but a couple didn't. One I hadn't even played properly until after the vote, and the other? The other is a flawed pick, but one that I couldn't stop thinking about.
Anyway, hope you all have a restful Xmas folks and a cracking new year. I hope Santa bought you some nice warm socks or a chocolate orange so dense, you could tee it off at your local golf club.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a sucker for a good first-person runabout. I don't need to shoot, but it's sometimes nice to get a sword, or a big whip. As long as I get to be immersed in an adventure. I think that's the big theme of my selection box: being grounded within my player character. I want to feel what it's like to hike through canyons with too much sellable loot in my backpack. I want to park my soul in the head of a scared Scotsman way out of his depth, hundreds of miles from shore. The closer I can comfortably fit in my character's shoes, the more I seem to buy into the world they inhabit. Even if that world is constantly glowing a magnificent crimson.

A new piracy scare story published on Sunday takes a different approach. The extraordinary claim is that fake IPTV portals run by law enforcement are entrapping "ordinary users" to obtain evidence of their crimes. Supported by exactly zero evidence, the report claims that hundreds of internet users have already been identified.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My selection box isn't really a selection box. It's a tray of barely-nibbled leftovers, hastily lifted from my Steam backlog. One of the disadvantages of being news editor, you see, is that I have  developed a goldfish-grade attention span. In my hectic pursuit of the next scoop, or the next Elden Ring update changelog, I snatch and cast aside game demos like a pickpocket speedrunning the checkout line at Harvey Nichols. I'm dimly aware that some of these cast-aside games are Very Good. A few might even deserve to be played for longer than 30 minutes. I feel immensely guilty about that. Perhaps a little... existential, too. I have measured out my life in tutorial levels. 


So! Rather than digging out three of the games I've actually completed this year, such as The Crush House, Death Of A Wish and Mask Quest, I'm going to gamble on recommending a few I've barely scratched, but which sure feel excellent and have attracted a positive critical consensus. If I am false in this assessment, may Horace the Endless Bear bite my head off for my impudence. Let's begin.

Here’s a shiny new package for you to unwrap, containing the first beta version of the upcoming OpenTTD 15 release. It comes faster, with road waypoints, fewer passwords, better scenario editor, and hopefully with a lot less bugs. To be a bit less vague, here are some of the highlights: Improved picker windows for stations/waypoints/objects/and more. Oh, and that does include road waypoints. Better perfomance in various places, including faster path signals that are now green by default. Password-less network authentication using keys. Several improvements for NewGRFs regarding cargo support. Better scenario editor with a town data importer and manual house placement. A large tree fully hung with ornamental bugfixes. Sadly though, not everbody was good this year. The old NPF pathfinder was finally retired, after YAPF being the superior default for many, many years now. There’s a lot of bugs left for you to find, though, guaranteed. Enjoy the beta, test all the things and report anything you find amiss, to make OpenTTD 15 the best OpenTTD 15 ever.

I lit my cyber-cigarette and put my feet on my desk, I don't know why, I thought it would make me look nonchalant to this strange woman. She wasn't impressed. "Detective," she said, glaring at me with eyes like gorgeous tennis balls, "I want to open today's advent calendar door." I was confused. "Whaddya wanna do that for, missy?" She sat back, relaxed, and pulled a gun from her purse. "I need to stuff a body into it."

Due to the intervention of Dark Powers and also, half the Treehouse already being on holiday, we neglected to do a round-up of staff Xmas plays before signing off for the year. Well, I’m pretty sure nobody did one. I can’t see anything scheduled in the RPS Post-A-Tron, but the RPS Post-A-Tron is an unreliable beast, full of malice and deceit. If I publish this and it turns out we have two, please divide into rival factions and have a comments war over which is the real one. Apologies! Normal service will resume next year.

The only thing missing from his account of the game was the bread needed to make that rich, meaty concoction a tasty, nourishing sandwich.
And by bread, I of course mean the strategic layer - the parts between the turn-based battles where you pick your next mission, improve your squads, deal with pop-up story events, appraise your standing with each NPC faction, and equip your strike cruiser with auxiliary systems. Developers Overhype have now shared a few details of how it all works. Mmmmm, such malty, yeasty strategicalness.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m hoping you’ll forgive a spot of mission-bending here, given Should You Bother With? Is usually intended to test out the new and the strange of gaming hardware. Instead, I want to talk about mini PCs – not just small-form-factor desktops, but properly tiny, box o’ chocolates-sized computers – which have, of course, been around for decades.
Recently, however, I’ve been wondering if mini PCs are finally on the cusp of having their moment as serious games machines. Between rising desktop component prices and ever-ballooning electricity bills, it would make sense that a smaller, cheaper system would take on a new appeal, and the success of handhelds like the Steam Deck and Asus ROG Ally show that convenience still trumps out-and-out performance for a lot of PC players. There have even been hints that Valve are resurrecting their Steam Machine mini PC concept, years after a flopping first attempt. Should you be interested?

Its structure most resembles Songs of Conquest or Heroes of Might and/or Magic, but with little RPG emphasis or base building, and minimal tactical fighting.
Taxonomy is arbitrary and often unimportant at the end of the day, but I am very glad to firmly rule it out of one category: It's not a bloody card game. It looks like one, sure. You do most things with cards, and characters acquire more cards over time. But even if you absolutely, utterly, and correctly loathe card-based systems, this game has none.

It begins as a "fireball of occult potentiality," dangling in the Great Hall of the Unseen University, which evolves into a ghostly "embryo universe." The embryo expands "lightly as a thought," with spectral continents "sleeting" through walls and people. It surges across the landscape until the entire population and geography of the Disc is exactly duplicated and enclosed by a shimmering shadow-self of "shining threads that followed every movement."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At any given moment I am in the center of a wonderful vortex of skeletons. Bones splash and rattle and burst out of the ground in sharp, horrible spurs. My weakest skeletons, sensing their death coming, explode into fire and shards. My strongest skeletons fight so hard and with such alacrity that upon dying, they drag their spirits together and keep fighting as ghosts for a while. Foul little bone scorpions skitter around on fans of legs made from human hands. Somewhere in the middle, almost invisible among the noise, is the character I am actually playing: Path of Exile 2’s mean-spirited, callous, and gleefully enjoyable Witch.
This is a review in progress. It has to be. Even in its incomplete early access period, Path of Exile 2 is a great sprawling mass of a game. Three meaty acts of a planned six act campaign are followed by a trickier return tour through them, before the absurd endgame kicks into gear and the real work begins. If I came to you having played everything on offer I would be wild-haired, bloodshot-eyed and possessing perfect, incomprehensible knowledge. Let’s compromise: I have toured the dark caverns and the antediluvian crypts. I have been killed by various accumulated nasties. I’ve had a great time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The announcement of The Witcher 4 with The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt's Ciri as protagonist has attracted a bit of discussion. Some of the reaction is online toddlers waxing wroth about a video game having a (somewhat older!!!) woman as lead character, and especially, shock, a video game in a series that has hitherto starred a man. And some of it is people commenting more thoughtfully on whether Ciri genuinely makes for a suitable Witcher protagonist, given that she isn't the product of the typical Witcher genetic modification regime (which is heavily tailored towards men), and given that, without spoiling too much, she has gifts that make crumbly old Geralt's sword-and-sorcery skillset look rather paltry. 


Speaking to Eurogamer this week, game director Sebastian Kalemba and narrative director Philipp Weber responded to a few of these comments, and also shared a little about Ciri's situation at the start of the game.

The dog was called Senator Umeshefaat, and he was very civil, even if he was shedding his black and white fur everywhere. We spoke in his home village at dawn. Later, I examined the senator's personal history more thoroughly and discovered he was "hated by bears for cooking them a rancid meal." I suppose every politician has their enemies. 
That Caves Of Qud creates fun anecdotes out of simple encounters shouldn't be a surprise. It has had 15 years of early access to establish itself as a small-but-mighty story generating roguelike of repute (there's a reason it sits deservedly side-by-side with Dwarf Fortress in the same publishing house). After creating many characters, and dying and dying and dying again, I understand why it grips the brain with such fierce glee. It is a machine of grand imagination and adventuresome comedy. A deceptively powerful RPG that isn't half as obtuse to newcomers as the screenshots make it out to be. Qud's low-res bark is just a complement to its bite.

Anyway, I have a job I need to get to and there's this guy who's going to mentor me on my first day. A guy called Mo, who seems nice but isn't particularly talkative. Prefers paper and pencil.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been rumoured for a while that Sony are about to buy Kadokawa Corporation, a monolithic Japanese media conglomerate that means nothing to the bulk of you unless I append the magic words "parent company of Dark Souls developers FromSoftware" and possibly also, "parent company of Spike Chunsoft". Sony and Kadokawa were reported to be in talks last month, fomenting all sorts of speculation about, say, the PC version of Bloodborne being ritually sacrificed to consecrate the PS6-exclusivity of Dark Souls 4. Now, the pair have emerged from the Cave of Haggling and announced... "a strategic capital and business alliance agreement". What does this mean? Is it safe to scream yet?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[They say hope is the first step on the road to disappointment, and reader, I’ve made a pretty damn big step. Previously, on my mission to survive S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl with only wild mutants as my weapons, I’d discovered clues that someone else was attempting to tame the Zone’s beastly inhabitants. With one of their electronic tracking collars in hand and absolutely no preexisting knowledge of their location, I set out to find this kindred spirit, only for the Zone to once again slam a door in my face.
A cold, steel, very literal door to boot. It turns out that the scientist’s laboratory is locked up tight, and will remain so until I delve about twenty hours deeper into the faction war that’s bubbled up while I’ve been running around throwing irradiated rats at people in tracksuits. Fine. Fine! But I’m keeping the collar.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fists up, a big fighting game mod is due out this weekend. Marvel vs Capcom Infinite came out in 2017 and got some flak for its plastic figurine art style. But this year a modder began work on an overhaul that would grant the game pretty cel-shaded visuals. Since then the modding team has grown to 40 people and the scope of the mod's features has ballooned. It's now going to include new moves, stages, costumes, and a chaotic-looking 2v2 multiplayer tag team mode. All good news for biff 'em up sickos, as the mod is due to release on Friday.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[First revealed all the way back in December 2023, Archetype Entertainment and Blur Studio's sci-fi action adventure Exodus hit us with a few things: Matthew McConaughey is involved, it looks a bit like Mass Effect, it's being developed by BioWare veterans, and it loves a bit of time dilation. In October of this year, we got a look at some icky celestial faction and zero in the way of actual gameplay. And now? Now we finally get a look at how you do things. Like sucker-punching armoured space bears in the face with electro-pistols.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After much teasing, the vicious tyrants of Arrowhead Games and their noxious puppets, the "democratic government" of Super Earth, have announced the very first Helldivers 2 licensed crossover. In yet another hollow display of solidarity and "Liber-tea", they've teamed up with the loathsome fascists of Killzone, the elderly shooter series from Sony and Guerrilla Games.
From today, you'll be able to buy weapons, armour and cosmetics belonging to Killzone's despicable stormtroopers from the Helldivers Superstore, and there's the suggestion of an additional Killzone-themed reward depending on the fortunes of the so-called Galactic War, a xenocidal bloodbath couched as an exercise in bringing "freedom" to the upstanding socialist Automatons, the blameless wildlife of the Tyranids, and the Wellsian cosplayers of the recently added Illuminate faction.
We here at Rock Paper Shotgun stand against Super Earth and Arrowhead's wanton aggression, which absolutely isn't a big satirical joke based on some Verhoeven film or other. Anyway, those capes. Find an image and further details below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Times Of Progress is a special game for me, because it's the first news tip I have ever received from Sin Vega, Prime Minister of Strategy Gaming. Sin once described writing news articles for our former news editor Alice0 (RPS in peace) as like practising backflips in front of the kung fu master. Writing about a new city builder at Sin's suggestion is like being invited to budget the development of Londinium by Julius Caesar.
The terror of screwing it up - together with other, more trivial distractions, like international games industry conferences - has stopped me from writing about Times Of Progress for months. Today I bite the bullet, and emerge from my lodgings to issue a hesitant speech to the masses, hoping like hell that Caesar is too preoccupied with the latest Gaul uprising to notice my errors.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Toy Box sounds like a very Xmassy game, but then you watch a trailer, and realise that it is not very Xmassy at all. It's a free visual novel with a macabre puzzling element. The setup is that you're a toy inspector working for a jovial Grand Toy Maker, his face hidden above the top of the screen. Your job is to disassemble toys - five in all - according to his eldritch written instructions, and either "salvage" them or "sentence" them to the incinerator.

If you missed the reveal, perhaps because you value sleep over the spectacle of Geoff Keighley's fashion friends, let me catch you up: in Nightreign, you pick one of eight preset characters and explore a parallel-universe version of Elden Ring's Limgrave map, fighting lesser foes and levelling up quickly so that you can battle a boss at the end of each 15-minute in-game day.
