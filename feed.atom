The Atelier series has grown in popularity here in the west in recent years, and now to top off the upcoming release of Atelier Ryza 3 later this month, Koei Tecmo will also be launching a remake of Atelier Marie on Switch this July.
If the return of the original 1997 game wasn't already exciting enough, it's now been revealed the bonus game Atelier Marie Plus (included with the Digital Deluxe Edition) will feature full English subtitles. This game was originally exclusive to Japan, so this translation will make it even more accessible.

Pokémon Trading Cards are as popular as ever - with original holographic Charizards often going for huge sums of money nowadays. It seems this isn't necessarily the case with every Pokémon card sale though.
A recent eBay auction featuring a holographic Illustrator Pikachu in "near-perfect condition" has apparently attracted "zero" interest. This special Japanese promotional card released in 1998 had a PSA 8 grading with the seller - "passionate Pokémon fan" Tomoya Ohno - asking for a starting bid of $480,000 USD. One of these same cards sold for $900,000 last year.

It's only week two of Destiny 2: Lightfall and already Bungie is adding more and more content with the expansion. As part of the Season of Defiance, players can now embark on a hidden Exotic mission to find the (very cool) Glaive, Vexcalibur. There's plenty of lore and some secrets hidden within this quest, but it's not the easiest or most obvious to find to begin with.
Head to the EDZ using the Gulch landing spot. You can do this solo or with friends, it doesn't make much difference. If nobody in the area has found all of them already, you will need to seek out six little glowing Vex nodes to jump through to obtain a keycode. This keycode will open up a cave.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It was... inevitable
The extremely compelling mobile card game Marvel Snap has had a stupendous launch, having raked in just over $50 million USD in revenue since its launch on iOS and Android platforms in October 2022.
The digital tabletop title — the first game from Californian studio Second Dinner — sees players build a deck of heroes and villains from the famous comic book brand, before going to battle in strategic, turn-based gameplay. Players can earn or purchase various new cards in order to build up their deck, and take part in limited-time events, seasons, and tournaments. Currently, the title is enjoying an Ant-Man-themed event, in collaboration with the recent Marvel Cinematic Universe release Ant-Man & The Wasp: Quantumania.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNuq6E3enZQ&ab_channel=MarvelEntertainment
Due to the exciting nature of the game's roster as well as a short playtime of only a few minutes — Marvel Snap won over a huge community of players at Quicksilver speed. Roughly 12 million players downloaded the title in its launch month with around $30 million in revenue pulled in by January of this year. Of course, many mobile titles enjoy this burst of incredible success in their opening six months, and time will tell whether Marvel Snap will continue to grow over the remainder of 2023. But given the popularity of the Marvel brand, and the overall quality of the game itself. I would expect those microtransaction bucks to keep rolling in for the foreseeable future.
Marvel Snap is available now on iOS and Android platforms. A console version is also in the works.

Arkane Austin has confirmed that its upcoming multiplayer shooter Redfall will support crossplay on all platforms and across all stores — This will allow monster hunters on Xbox Series X/S, PC, and Xbox Game Pass to rock out together, including PC players on both Steam and Epic Games Store.
The "all-in" crossplay support is a no-brainer for the multiplayer-driven title, and will allow for a larger shared player community which can only help to grow and prolong the life of Redfall and its nefarious nocturnal activities. Up to four players step into the uniquely talented roles of four uber-hip characters, before heading into the titular Massachusetts town in order to purge it of an army of unholy creatures.
https://twitter.com/playRedfall/status/1632773032744828928?s=20
Originally revealed back in the summer of 2021, Redfall would ultimately miss its intended 2022 release date, but is now pretty much cemented to arrive in just a couple of months' time. While a lack of an open beta or demo leaves us with nothing but the title's atmospheric trailers to go on, we can expect a Left 4 Dead/Back 4 Blood style team shooter, with parties of players harnessing wild weapons and bespoke otherworldly abilities to put the legions of the undead back in the cold, cold ground.
Redfall launches May 2 on Xbox Series X, PC, and the Xbox Game Pass service.

Anyone who makes or writes music knows that the path to a complete track isn’t a linear one. It’s a process where instruments weave in and out of the composition on the whim of the person making it. And even when the vision is clear, and you know exactly where you want to take the song, be it behind a drum set, a keyboard, a loop track, or even a computer, things can get in the way. Rytmos, developer Floppy Club’s first non-mobile game, nails that feeling. It uses puzzles to extract the joy, escalation, triumphs, and trials of making music, and it does so with g…]]></summary>

Forever Entertainment has dropped a new trailer for Storm Trident’s Front Mission 2: Remake, and along with it has included a release date of June 12, 2023. It’s currently slated as a Nintendo Switch exclusive.
Front Mission 2 was released on Sony’s original PlayStation way back in 1997. Notably, this entry in the series never left Japan. It takes place 12 years after Front Mission 1st, showing a future Bangladesh (renamed Alordesh) as they seek to sever ties from the OCU. The narrative baton is passed between three protagonists as they discover a conspiracy behind the anti-OCU coup d’etat.

The remake boasts new visuals, a free-zoom ability to get right in close to your Wanzers, and a “renewed” soundtrack. Underneath the modern gloss, Front Mission 2 Remake “preserves the mature story, strategic turn-based combat, and Wanzer customization options of the original.”
While the Front Mission 1st: Remake didn’t set my world on fire, it did leave me primed for the sequel. Beyond simply being fun strategy games, I love tinkering with the Wanzers to create the ultimate stompy force. My only previous experience with this series was looking over a roommate’s shoulder as they played through Front Mission 3, so having the ability to experience the series in order has been a welcome one.
Front Mission 2: Remake releases exclusively for Nintendo Switch on June 12, 2023.

What day is it this Friday? I'll tell you what it is, it's MAR10 Day, dagnabbit, and The LEGO Company is preparing to show off something new and special in order to celebrate Nintendo's most famous and perhaps most beloved character (after Luigi).
On Friday, the toymaker will be holding a special "Lego Super Mario YouTube Premiere" live stream, offering updates on its lovely LEGO Super Mario range and teasing "exclusive content and a big reveal". The action kicks off on the official LEGO YouTube channel at 00:80 PT / 11:00 ET / 17:00 GMT and will be hosted by Jack Gardner — who I am assuming is not the former 1950 British Empire boxing champion.
https://twitter.com/LEGO_Group/status/1632758034895077376?s=20
The LEGO Super Mario range, which launched in the summer of 2020, has consisted of multiple sets and showpieces featuring the characters and worlds of Nintendo's best-selling series. For younger players, there are sets that allow for the building of "courses" to be played by smart interactive Maxifigures of Mario, Luigi, and Princess Peach. For the more dedicated collector, LEGO has released prestige (and pricey) kits of the Super Mario 64 Question Block, Bowser's Airship, and The Mighty Bowser himself.
We'll be sure to pick you abreast, and abrick, of all the news from the LEGO stream once it is revealed.

These days, it feels like it takes a lot more for a Metroidvania to stand out from the pack, especially when there are so many excellent titles that have already shown impressively creative takes on the genre standards. Pronty from Taiwanese indie developer 18Light makes its bid for your attention by plopping players in a dark, deep-sea environment that can be freely explored in all directions. It has some issues here or there, but Pronty overall does a great job of presenting players with an occasionally challenging and always alluring adventure that feels like a welcome addition to a crowded genre.
Pronty places you in the role of the eponymous aquatic creature who wakes up on their birthday eager to finally become an official Protector for the undersea human city of Royla. However, while running through some training drills with their robotic swordfish companion, Bront, an evil giant fish named Raksha attacks and all Protectors are immediately called in to defend the city. Given that Pronty was stationed at an outpost that’s on the very edge of the frontier, they have a long journey ahead before they can join in the counteroffensive and there are various overt and subtle hints along the way that the damage to Royla is much worse than it first seemed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Riot Games announced last month that three League of Legends games would arrive this year, including The Mageseeker: A League of Legends story. Now, the company has announced that The Mageseeker will hit consoles and PC next month. 
More specifically, The Mageseeker will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on April 18. It will cost $29.99 on digital storefronts, and preorders include the Lost Silverwing in-game bonus. You can also purchase the Digital Deluxe Edition for $39.99, and it includes additional digital items like a Silverwing Supply Station Pack, Home Sweet Home cave decorations, exclusive spells, and Unchained skins. 
Check out the game in action in the new trailer below: 


"Developed by Digital Sun, creators of Moonlighter, the Mageseeker is a gritty 2D hi-bit pixel action RPG, set in Demacia, a mighty kingdom in the world of Runeterra that seeks to curtail what it deems as forbidden magic while wielding magic themselves to maintain order," a press release reads. "Play as Sylas, an escaped mage who joins a band of rebels in the deep forest. Their revolution will shatter Damcai's deceptive peace – a peace built with the blood and sweat of mages. The Mageseeker provides an action-packed fantasy gameplay experience for those looking to experience a story of power, identity, and justice." 
Riot Games also revealed today that it is selling a physical Collector's Edition of the game for $169.99. It includes a Sylas statue, an art book, a deluxe art print, the Lux Comic (special edition hardcover), Sylas & Lux enamel pins, and a vinyl soundtrack. All of this comes housed within an exclusive custom box. 

The Mageseeker follows the release of 2021's League of Legends Story game, Ruined King. Check out our thoughts on that in the Game Informer's Ruined King: A League of Legends Story review. The other two games Riot Games plans to release this year are Song of Nunu and Convergence.

When Tunic made its way over to the Switch back in September 2022, it quickly rocketed into our list of the very best games of the year. Now, we are raring to leap back into the little fox's mysterious world all over again as publisher Finji has today announced that the game will be getting a physical deluxe edition release!
Now, many of us have poured enough sweat and tears into getting through some of the game's tougher bosses over the last six months that the thought of heading in again might seem like a daunting one. However, apart from how much fun the game is (seriously, just play it again), the deluxe edition has just enough goodies to make us come back for more.

Ridiculous, maybe, but these paranoid questions run through my head as Yu climbs a mountain. No safety gear. No helmet. Just his own hands, sneakers, and determination. I have to follow soon after, and though I’m undoubtedly scared, in the moment, I’m much more afraid of killing the creator of Spelunky than my own mortality. Though you could argue, in this hyper-specific example, the game should’ve been a cautionary tale. In Spelunky, you do die a lot. Nevertheless, I don’t want to be responsible for the death of one of the game industry’s most beloved indie developers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hit the books ahead of launch
Would-be wizard generals will get a chance to test out GrimGrimoire for themselves today. Vanillaware and NIS America are releasing a demo for GrimGrimoire OnceMore, for PlayStation and Nintendo Switch.
Set in a magical school, GrimGrimoire OnceMore follows the very eventful early days of Lillet Blan. As things get bad, she'll eventually have to put her schooling to use in the form of side-scrolling strategy warfare using familiars and grimoires.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YO4B3IEaCJU
OnceMore is a remaster of Vanillaware's original GrimGrimoire, a 2007 PlayStation 2 strategy game. And it looks like the developer's putting together a pretty solid list of improvements to the original experience.
An altered screen ratio and updated resolution help on the graphics side. Grand Magic spells, an added Skill Tree, and the Tactical Notebook all serve to offer more to do on the gameplay side of things, too. And a new Gallery features illustrations from Vanillaware staff, with over 90 images created for GrimGrimoire and OnceMore.
Cast a spell on you
This isn't the first time Vanillaware's brought forward one of its earlier hits to modern systems. The absolutely superb Odin Sphere Leifthrasir put the action-RPG back in the conversation. (Side note: I do hope that eventually gets a Switch or Steam port.)
Meanwhile, 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim made a fairly big impact for Vanillaware. With that in mind, it's neat to see them going back to the vault and pulling out a piece of the studio's history that feels linked, if only by the strategy genre. Today's GrimGrimoire demo should give players an idea of just how it's evolved over the years, and a taste of what's to come from the remaster.
GrimGrimoire OnceMore hits PS4, PS5, and Nintendo Switch on April 4, 2023.

With the launch of Destiny 2: Lightfall came a new Darkness subclass, Strand. Whilst the initial fan reception to Strand was pretty underwhelming, as time has gone on the more dedicated players have had time to dig deep into the new subclass and come up with some powerful new builds. We've already covered Warlocks and Hunters, with armies of Threadlings and infinite enemy suspension all possible. This time we're going to take a look at the space shooter's brutes, the Titans.
We're looking to create a build that will give unlimited barricades to protect against incoming enemy fire as well as turn you into a suspending machine. We're obviously going to be using the Strand subclass, and some important aspects, fragments, and armor mods to help achieve that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Getting lost in Hyrule Field all over again
Modder RiazorMC is at it again, and their latest fan-created track happens to be the "Ocarina of Time Circuit" for Mario Kart 8. Note that yes, Mario Kart 8 has gotten official Zelda DLC in the past with Hyrule Circuit: but not necessarily in a purely retro format. This track aims to bring back the 1998 Nintendo 64 classic in full force, steering through a big chunk of the overworld. Like several other Mario Kart tracks that shift zones across multiple laps, this track zooms across multiple major areas of Ocarina of Time, and hits many of the bigger notes.
Here's how the track plays out:
Lap 1: Gerudo's Fortress (also the Kokiri Forest)
Lap 2: Lake Hylia
Lap 3: Death Mountain (across Hyrule Field)
The course takes you through pretty much all of Hyrule Field, and has a pretty intense/semi-confusing layout to boot. It would take multiple attempts to really figure out where to go since the signs aren't very pronounced, and several of the locations (including riding up the narrow ascent of Death Mountain, as well as navigating the depths of Lake Hylia) are tricky.
With some refinement, this could be a legit course I would definitely play. Hopefully Nintendo has more crossovers in the works for their Mario Kart 8 Deluxe DLC tracks (and beyond, on whatever inevitable next series entry is being worked on now). I've said this for years, but I can see Nintendo doing a Mario Kart All-Stars game at some point, especially once the franchise hits critical mass.

Without hyperbole, Romancelvania has been one of my most anticipated releases this year. I just didn’t expect it to be so soon this year, and honestly, it probably shouldn’t have been. As a fan of both Castlevania and dating sims, you couldn’t throw a bowling ball further up my alley. It’s like inviting me to an afternoon of tea and ToeJam & Earl. I am there. I am already there.
However, my impressions of Romancelvania’s early demo haven’t been forgotten. My worry was that meshing the two concepts was an ambition out of reach of a small team. Having played through the whole game and landed my big fish, I have to say that the chase was indeed a lot more exciting than actually getting it into bed.

The 1.2.0 update to Pokémon Scarlet & Violet brought a lot of nice little additions and improvements to Paldea. A handful of bug fixes — such as accurate reflection of damage done in Tera Raid battles and some quality of life updates for the in-game Pokémon PC boxes — certainly go a long way into taking the Poison Sting out of the continued issues surrounding the technically troubled adventure.
However, booting up Scarlet & Violet after installing this update reveals that, unfortunately, a ton of problems (including an apparent save data bug) still plague the game like a horde of ornery Rattata.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Light Brigade has no direct relation to the British light cavalry unit made famous in the poem by Alfred, Lord Tennyson (which, if you head over to the poem's Wikipedia page, you can hear Tennyson himself read out via a phonograph recording from 1890 – Cool Factz!) But there is one bit of connective tissue, namely that charging into the fray is generally a bad idea. In the case of the game, that's because The Light Brigade is VR roguelike, one that blends Souls-like dark fantasy with World War II-era weaponry, with you playing a spiritually immortal but physically fragile warrior responsible for saving the world.

We played the game's opening eight hours and spoke with the team's creative director, artists, and sound designer and composer (as well as Chrono Trigger composer, Yasunori Mitsuda who is contributing music to the game!) about bringing its fantasy world to life and living up to the quality of the games that inspired it.
We have two amazing covers for Sea of Stars from Sabotage Studio senior concept artist Bryce Kho. The standard cover (below) shows the Solstice Warriors, Valere and Zale, along with their friend Garl, moving through the Forbidden Cavern while carefully avoiding monsters. The artwork f…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A physical edition is coming this week, too.
Akka Arrh was, for a long time, one of Atari's long-lost treasures, an arcade shooter that was scrapped back in the '80s. After making its return in Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration, legendary game designer Jeff Minter and his studio Llamasoft brought an updated version to consoles in the form of a kaleidoscope of colours and sounds.
Atari sat down with Minter in a recent video to discuss how and why he decided to bring this once-lost classic back from the brink, with updated visuals, gameplay, and sounds. It's a brief video, but Minter's experience and interests shine through as he details the process from how the original ROM was saved to his decision to make the game a bit more "relaxed".

Valve’s handheld SteamOS games machine has successfully evaded hardware flop status, currently sitting fourth in Steam’s own top sellers list a full year after it began shipping. That’s well deserved, too: the Steam Deck was a fun little alternative way to play PC games when it released, and through a combination of added features, ongoing improvements to game compatibility, and simply a wider choice of great games, it’s a better device now than it’s ever been.


I was originally going to look back on the Steam Deck’s first 12 months with my eyes only, but what fun is a party of one? Thus I invited Valve designer Lawrence Yang and engineer Pierre-Loup Griffais for their takes on the Deck’s past, present, and future.

The Barcelona, Spain-based studio, which was founded in 2014, will end development on all of its projects as a result of closing its doors in April, as reported by Gematsu. The studio cites unfavorable "economic context" as the reason it's shutting down after nine years of development, primarily creating 2016's Aragami, its Nightfall DLC, and 2021's Aragami 2.

We're almost at Wave 3 of the season pass for Fire Emblem Engage, and wow, that time has just flown by.
As revealed in the February Nintendo Direct, Hector, Soren, Camilla, Chrom, Robin, and Veronica are all coming to the game in spirit form. Chrom and Robin happen to be the newest kids on the block, and they actually launch on March 8. Thanks to the official Japanese Fire Emblem Twitter account, we have some footage of what that meeting actually looks like, and how the pair operate in battle.
You really can't go wrong with releasing all-star former series cast members as DLC, I have to say. Although not every facet of the fandom is going to be thrilled with "X or Y" inclusion, you're going to hit some superfans, and dropping them in duos is a great way to split the difference. So far the character DLC has been a great appetizer for the main course. About that!

What's next for Fire Emblem Engage DLC?
As a reminder, Wave 4 is the big one. That includes the Fell Xenologue chapter, which is a new story sequence.
Most of the other DLC takes place in the Divine Paralogue islands, which is the core DLC destination.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Power to the Players
According to new data from industry analysts GfK, the UK saw a massive surge in the sale of PlayStation 5 (PS5) hardware and software in February 2023, with the numbers suggesting an increase of around 316% over the same period in 2022.
The data, (as reported by GamesIndustry.biz), recognizes that the massive increase in hardware sales is down to two defining factors: the PS5 become more readily available to purchase online and in the high street, and the launch of Warner Bros. title Hogwarts Legacy, which launched on February 10 and has already laid claim to being the sixth best-selling release in the past 12 months. In February, PS5 sales were up 27% on January 2023, and up 180% over January — February 2022.
Aside from the Sony sales surge, the Xbox platform has also seen a moderate increase in hardware sales, with Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S consoles enjoying increased sales of 21% over January 2023, and 15% over February 2022. When compared to January — February 2022, hardware sales are slightly down by around 5.3%.
It also appears that the hard-running generation veteran, Nintendo Switch, is finally starting to show its age — at least where street life is concerned. The hybrid console saw its sales slump by 15% when compared to January 2022, as well as being down by a huge 29% when compared to February 2022. While there are still exciting new titles on the horizon — such as the forthcoming The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom — a steady decline in sales is expected, given the format's six-year legacy.

A brand new rating for a Switch version Solar Ash, developer Heart Machine's second game following the gorgeous and brutal Hyper Light Drifter, has been spotted on the official PEGI database (via Nintendo Everything).
The rating lists the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 versions, plus a newly dated Switch version with a 7th March, 2023 date. The PS4 and 5 dates (2nd December, 2022) match up with the original game's launch on those consoles — Steam and Xbox followed suit in 2022 — so does that mean a surprise is imminent from Heart Machine or publisher Annapurna?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer The Outsiders has announced the first piece of premium DLC for its critically acclaimed rhythm-based shooter, Metal: Hellsinger. The game, which challenges you to blast the demons of Hell to the beat of an original soundtrack featuring some of the biggest names in metal, is adding two new original songs to the soundtrack through the first piece of downloadable content.
The DLC, Dream of the Beast, adds original songs from two singers who didn't appear on the main game's soundtrack. Cristina Scabbia from Lacuna Coil and Will Ramos from Lorna Shore join the cast of recognizable singers to contribute to the soundtrack. Dream of the Beast also adds The Red Right Hand, a new machine gun, and three new outfits, each of which provide unique gameplay modifiers.
These updates join the game as part of the Dream of the Beast DLC, but players who don't purchase the premium content also have something to be excited for. The same day the DLC arrives, players can expect a free title update for Metal Hellsinger. This free update adds a new song selection feature.
Both of these updates arrive on March 29 on all platforms. The game, which took home Game Informer's "Best Shooter" award for 2022, is available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.

You can also read our interview with System of a Down singer Serj Tankian, who contributed to the base game's soundtrack, right here.]]></summary>

He declared that accounts engaging in "repeated, egregious weaponization of DMCA on Twitter" will receive temporary suspensions. The problems began when a popular user tweeted a stunning video owned by a professional photographer, who responded by sending a DMCA takedown notice. That sounds straightforward, but this dispute is a lot more complex than that.

The gorgeous hand-drawn visuals of The Library of Babel caught our eye when we first saw the above announcement trailer, and we now know that this stealth platformer will be making its way over to Switch on 7th April.
From developer Tanuki Game Studio and based on the short story by Jorge Luis Borges, The Library of Babel takes place 20,000 years after the extinction of humanity and will see you exploring the robot world of Mesopotamia to investigate a murder. The 2D platformer looks to be all about sneaking through environments to find clues while avoiding the mechanical gaze of patrolling enemies — please, we have only just about got over Metroid Dread's E.M.M.I.

Now Mars Horizon is getting an expanded sequel, taking us to the outer reaches of the Solar System. Mars Horizon 2: The Search For Life is releasing sometime in 2024 on PC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What a month!
Microsoft has announced their Xbox Game Pass schedule for March, 2023, and it's a doozy!
In addition to Guilty Gear Strive's debut on the platform, we also have Dead Space 2 and 3 coming on March 9. Although Dead Space 3 has its own set of problems (and microtransactions), the second core entry in the series is fantastic, and often heralded as the best in the franchise (like, uh, right here!). It's also perfect to head straight into after playing through the Dead Space remake.
Shifting gears a bit, Valheim and Civilization VI are hitting Game Pass next week, which is a nice little out-there mix of survival and strategy. Then at the end of the month on March 21, Ni No Kuni II (Prince's Edition) is coming to console and PC. Just in case you needed another lengthy JRPG.
It's a pretty great reminder of how varied the Game Pass system can be from month to month. Although not every addition is going to hit for everyone, this is such a wide spread that I'm sure someone will be ensnared for another month. I mean, you could probably just justify playing Civ VI most of March and dabble in something else and get your money's worth.
Xbox Game Pass Additions for the week of March 6, 2023: 
Guilty Gear –Strive-, March 7 (Cloud, Console and PC)
Dead Space 2, March 9 (Cloud)
Dead Space 3, March 9 (Cloud)

Sid Meier’s Civilization VI, March 16 (Cloud, Console, and PC)
Xbox Game Pass Additions for the week of March 20, 2023:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blue-sky thinking.
The release of the Crossbell Saga in English has been a long time coming for fans of the Trails series. And with The Legend of Heroes: Trails from Zero’s cracking debut last September, the wait for Trails to Azure has had us salivating. And finally, the missing gap in the series has been filled, and the conclusion of the Crossbell arc has reached us. We’ve already said that Zero makes a case for being one of the series’ best entries, and Azure takes that statement and runs with it.
Set a few months after the end of Trails from Zero, Trails to Azure once again follows the Special Support Section (SSS) as they help the citizens of Crossbell, which is enjoying a temporary period of peace. But as political turmoil looms around the corner, and multiple nefarious organisations begin to worm their way into the state, the SSS – led by Lloyd Bannings – also has personal stakes wrapped within the tangled web of Crossbell’s fate. One, the truth behind the murder of Lloyd’s older brother Guy, and two, the importance of a little girl the SSS saved in Zero, KeA.

In the case of new town builder Outlanders, I'd have to share a house with five other people, the farmer just died of old age, and my leader wanders around doing nothing while occasionally issuing edicts forcing me to have children. But at least there's a chance of pumpkin pie.

Less than a year ago, Trails fans finally got their hands on an officially localized release of The Legend of Heroes: Trails from Zero. Released for the PSP back in 2010, the game never made its way over the Pacific, robbing players outside Japan and China of the chance to experience the Crossbell Arc of the greater Legend of Heroes storyline. Zero would be the game that introduced me to the Trails series as a whole, and I found it to be a highly enjoyable (if super chatty) RPG.
Of course, as good as it was, Zero only covered the first part of the Crossbell Arc. And while it certainly didn’t feel like it was half a game, its ending did leave me clamoring for its 2011 sequel, Trails to Azure, which will release outside of Japan and China for the first time next week.

Despite my love for large-scale simulation games like Cities: Skylines as an adult, I was not a SimCity player growing up. Instead, I was pulled in the direction of the more manageable SimTown. The zoomed-in town management, where you can micromanage every aspect of your citizens' lives without the massive scope of SimCity, always appealed to me more. Perhaps that's why Outlanders, a simplistic yet challenging settlement builder, has now sunk its hooks into me on two occasions across both of its platforms.
In this small-scale managem…]]></summary>

The game is still in its early stages of development, but Hyperfocus has confirmed a release for Nintendo Switch nonetheless and is even offering a physical copy for the console as one of its backing rewards (thanks, Nintendo Everything).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Kept you waitin' huh?
One of the most chaotic and dynamic fighters of the current age, Guilty Gear Strive, is now ready to rock on Xbox and PC (Microsoft Store) platforms, following on from its initial 2021 release on PlayStation and Steam.
Arc System Works' dazzling anime fighter can be purchased in standard digital form for around $40 USD from the Microsoft Store or downloaded via paid subscription service Xbox Game Pass. For those who wish to get fully up to speed, then an "Ultimate Edition", complete with Season Pass 1 & 2 as well as a fistful of special character colors, is available to purchase for a loftier $80. So if you want to play as post-release DLC characters such as Bridget, Goldlewis Dickinson, Happy Chaos, Baiken, or my main squeeze Testament, that's the version to bag.

Guilty Gear Strive is an effort by ArcSys to wind back the intricacies of the uber-deep fighter, hoping to wedge open the door a little for series newcomers. While this direction has admittedly met with some pushback from the long-time GG community, it can't be denied that Strive is the most approachable GG title in some years, and is the release to grab for anyone on the fence about this fine fighting series. For the old-schoolers, the excellent Guilty Gear Xrd Rev 2 recently got updated netcode on Steam, so there's a GG out there and ready to rock for all y'all. C'mon, let's be pals.
Guilty Gear Strive is available now on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Xbox Game Pass. Check it out.

We already know that the Legend of Zelda and Mario Kart are a match made in heaven thanks to Hyrule Circuit in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. We're quite surprised we haven't seen another Zelda-themed course in the game, to be honest. But, don't worry, modder and YouTuber RiazorMC has taken matters into their own hands and popped the world of Ocarina of Time into Mario Kart (via Twitter).
Zelda Ocarina of Time Circuit is a custom track mod from RiazorMC and is based on the 3DS remake's version of Hyrule. The course starts at the mouth of the Deku Tree and takes the racers through Kokiri Forest, Hyrule Field, Gerudo Valley, and Lake Hylia — where there's a spectacular gliding section going from the Valley to the Lake.

Harebrained Schemes, the studio behind Battletech and the Shadowrun Returns trilogy, has a new strategy game. Today, Harebrained and Paradox revealed The Lamplighters League, a pulp fiction adventure that mixes stealth and strategy with quite a look.
Announced as part of today's Paradox Announcement Show, The Lamplighters League definitely has an XCOM sort of vibe to it. You manage a motley crew of misfits, all working together to stop the Banished Court cult from taking over the world.
As the tagline notes, "Unfortunately, the best of the best are all gone, so now it's up to the best of the worst." Today's announcement trailer emphasizes that a bit, as your team are not quite pristine heroes, so much as endearing rapscallions.

Yes, this isn't the best gaming SSD in terms of raw speed, but its PCIe 4.0 design means that it uses less power and fewer lanes than PCIe 3.0 alternatives of the same speed, a nicety for desktop use and a big deal for laptops.

A healthy batch o' blogs this week, thanks a lot! Thanks to Lord Spencer for taking the time out of their week to recap them for the front page. As always, if you wanna join in on the HOT TAKE party, then head on over to the Cblogs section right now.
We are aware that the cblog editor has been incredibly testy of late. We apologize. We are hoping we can encourage someone more tech-savvy than ourselves to take a look at it this year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey Yo, (yo)
Guilty Gear Strive superstar Bridget is the latest beloved gaming character to join Good Smile Co's "Pop Up Parade" range of affordable figurines. The yo-yo swinging scrapper is available to pre-order now at Good Smile Co. and other anime-lovin' toy stores.
Produced by legendary merch-makers Max Factory, Pop Up Parade Bridget stands a little under seven inches in height and is rocking her modernized Guilty Gear Strive look — standing in a cute 'n' coy pose with her "Tricky Spinner" in hand. Like her Pop Up brethren, Bridget is a static figurine with zero points of articulation or any accompanying accessories, but that doesn't mean that she isn't sporting some fine detail and great, vivid coloring.

If you want to pick up a Bridget for your bookshelf, then you can pre-order her now from the official Good Smile Co. website or whichever anime/gaming merchandiser is your turf. Bridget retails for around ¥5,500, (roughly $40 USD), not including any shipping or potential customs charges. She is expected to come rolling into your world later this summer.
Since Bridget made her Guilty Gear return, our girl has become pretty popular on the merchandise market, with this adorable plush doll, also from Good Smile Co., and this devastatingly expensive replica of her iconic bullet yo-yo. Additionally, Bridget has featured highly in the realm of fan art projects, such as this cute PS1-style animation. She's most certainly on her way to becoming one of the franchise's most recognizable characters.
Guilty Gear Strive is available now on PlayStation and PC platforms. An Xbox port will arrive this spring.

You might want to be cautious playing Pokemon Scarlet and Violet for the time being. Several players have reported that their Pokemon Scarlet / Violet save files were wiped following the most recent game update, and there isn't a clear cause just yet.
Over on the game's subreddit, as reported by Kotaku, players have been discussing the issue. Reports of the issue are popping up in a thread here, starting with "at least 5" and climbing from there.
"Obviously this is a small number of players overall, but people need to be aware there is some level of risk," wrote the original poster. "I lost a 595 hour save file because of this, and so far nothing can be done to recover my save."
Right now, the silver lining is that this issue seems to be …]]></summary>

The controversial and highly lucrative FIFA Ultimate Team system is in hot water once again — This time, the trouble comes from an Austrian court, which has officially ruled that the microtransaction-based digital card collector violates the nation's gambling laws.
As reported by German news outlet GamesWirtschaft, the verdict comes at the end of a 2022 lawsuit that was filed against Sony Interactive Entertainment by a group of PlayStation FIFA players. The suit is directed at Sony rather than FIFA publisher Electronic Arts because the FUT packs were purchased on the PlayStation Network, which makes the sales contract with Sony, and not with EA itself.

This follow-up builds upon its 2015 predecessor with new features, such as fully-realized transportation and economy systems. Paradox didn’t reveal too many other specifics beyond stating in a press release that the game features “ a wealth of construction and customization options and advanced modding capabilities.” Cities: Skylines II is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S (including Game Pass), and PC. Check out the teaser trailer below:


The original game was a big success, having sold over 12 million copies and filling the simulation gap left by SimCity's hiatus. Developer Colossal Order has supported it with multiple updates and expansions, including a VR port and a recent current-gen remaster. You can read our original reviews of Cities: Skylines on PC here and the console edition here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One last ride before the store shuts down
The Nintendo 3DS eShop is closing down later this month. But before the doors close, Silver Falls series developer Sungrand Studios is getting one last launch on the Nintendo 3DS.
Sungrand has announced that two Silver Falls titles are headed to the Nintendo 3DS, in one bundle. Silver Falls Gaiden Deathly Delusion Destroyers and Silver Falls Ruby River both arrive on the digital storefront on March 9.
The two games will be bundled together into one for $16.99, going live only in North America on March 9. It doesn't sound like there are plans to create any physical copies at the moment, either. So you'll only have a narrow window of time before the 3DS eShop closes later this month.
Deathly Delusion Destroyers looks to be a "battle RPG," as the developer describes it. Holding the 3DS sideways, your characters hold out on the right-hand side while enemies flow in from the left. It reminds me a bit of that Flash classic, The Last Stand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-TXT4-zySs
Ruby River, meanwhile, looks like a first-person survival crafting situation. You build a shelter, start a fire, cook steak, and generally try to stay alive as horrors strike.
Heading back to Silver Falls
Sungrand Studios is no stranger to releasing games on platforms that will soon cease to exist. Both Silver Falls - White Inside Its Umbra and Silver Falls Undertakers released on the Wii U for NA last month, and the Wii U is also due to close its online shop soon.
Heck, Sungrand has another Silver Falls game on the 3DS already, though our reviewer wasn't so keen on Silver Falls: 3 Down Stars. I respect the effort to try and be one of the last games on a soon-to-close digital platform, though. If you're still aching for more games to fill the 3DS slots up, the new Silver Falls bundle goes live later this week on March 9.

As part of the Paradox Announcement Show, Paradox Tectonic has announced Life By You, which at first glance is looking like a take on The Sims. A teaser trailer has been dropped, with the promise that we’ll get a deeper look on March 20.
[embed]https://youtu.be/ZNhV-Gnjdy8[/embed]
While it doesn’t seem like Cities: Skylines developer Colossal Order is involved, I felt that this would be a natural progression for the publisher as a whole. Some of the footage seems to imply a wider environment than just the household. That said, I can’t fathom how a smaller developer could compete with the incredible monolith that The Sims 4 has become. Still, I have hopes, but we’re going to have to wait to find out more.
More news about Life By You will be coming on March 20th.

As part of the Paradox Announcement Show, the publisher has finally teased the coming of Cities: Skylines II with a tentative release date of this year. So far, we’ve only got a teaser trailer to whet our appetite and that kind of sucks.
https://youtu.be/vP_h2OM2zFY
Cities: Skylines was released eight years ago in 2015 and has enjoyed continuous updates. Released in the fallout from the massive disappointment that was 2013’s SimCity, Colossal Order’s city builder has sold millions of copies. Numerous expansions have built upon the game’s bones, but many, like myself, have been awaiting the next big iteration. I don’t exactly know where they can go from Cities: Skylines, but I have a wishlist. I mostly just want my city peeps to have more depth. Let me zoom right into their nostrils.
"The Cities brand has been an important part of Paradox’s catalog of games for over a decade. Cities: Skylines is a profound success, selling millions of copies, welcoming more than 5.5 million new players just last year, and setting the foundation for Cities: Skylines II," said Fredrik Wester, CEO of Paradox Interactive. "With unprecedented amounts of customization and player control, Cities: Skylines II will continue to push boundaries for the city-building franchise."
Cities: Skylines II is slated for Xbox Series X |S, PS5, and PC this year.

The super auto-battler did eventually start making custom artwork for its later expansions, but much of the furious fauna was still emojis. That has now changed with today's patch, going back to replace all the old emojis with new animal pictures. Goodbye, old friends.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Frogwares' latest Sherlock adventure has gone gold
Sherlock Holmes' next virtual mystery is arriving soon after all. Developer Frogwares has announced that Sherlock Holmes The Awakened has gone gold, and will go live for PC, PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch on April 11.
Pre-orders are going live on storefronts today with three editions. The standard edition will run $39.99 on all platforms. Deluxe, meanwhile, will net you some side quest packs and additional outfits for $10 more, while the premium rolls in a digital artbook and soundtrack for $54.99.
In a press release, Frogwares confirms Sherlock Holmes The Awakened is "content complete" and playable from start to finish. A new trailer showing Holmes' investigations into the horrors of the deep is out too, so you can see just how creepy this one will get.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV0Dmvxjld4
Mysteries of the deep
Frogwares is based out of Kyiv, Ukraine, and has been sharing updates about how the conflict in the region has been affecting development. Much like fellow Ukranian developers GSC Game World, the invasion and ongoing fighting has greatly affected the project, and the update from a few weeks ago showed just how the power outages and other factors have affected development of Sherlock Holmes The Awakened.
The Awakened is a remake of Frogwares' own 2007 Sherlock game. In the time since, Forgwares has made plenty more Sherlock, and also released the Lovecraft-sans-Holmes mystery The Sinking City. I'm betting that fans of this series are probably curious about how the studio approaches this older work now, with many more years of making Sherlock games under its belt.
Sherlock Holmes The Awakened arrives on April 11 for PC, Switch, PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X.

What is Metal Dogs, and what does it have to do with tank-a-licious series, Metal Max? It’s a run-and-gun spin-off featuring the series’ best boy, Pochi. Aside from that, not much. While it’s set in the sort of grimmer world of Metal Max Xeno, gameplay is entirely different. You outfit your mutt with canons, sub-weapons, and special equipment, then delve some dungeons with various objectives. There are wanted monsters, but you’re not really hunting them as you would in the main series. It’s mostly just call…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Puma has unveiled a new shoe collection inspired by the popular MMORPG, Final Fantasy XIV. 
The collaboration will consist of four shoes: two Puma Slipstream models and two RS-X models, as reported by Techraptor. For each model type, there's a (Warrior of) Light version and a Dark version, which basically equates to white and blue-green, and black and purple-pink. All four of the shoes look great but before you get too attached, these shoes are Japan-only for now. There's no word on if they'll come to the U.S. 
Check out the shoes in the gallery below: 

Each of these shoes will cost 17,050 yen, which is roughly $125, according to Techraptor. They will be released in Japan next week on March 15. 
Shoes inspired by video games have risen in popularity, with Converse releasing two sets of Pokémon-inspired shoes last year. Perhaps more than any other shoe maker, though, Puma has been steadily releasing video game shoes. In 2018, it released a pair of sneakers based on Sonic the Hedgehog's iconic red shoes and then in 2020, Puma released a line of Super Mario All-Stars shoes. Puma announced some NBA 2K21 shoes in 2021 and then just two months later, the company revealed an Animal Crossing: New Horizons line of sneakers. 
While waiting to learn more, read Game Informer's Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker review.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As I have complained about mightily in the past, I grew up somwhere that didn't have much in the way of entertainment, so me and my friends had to engage in the time honoured tradition of making our own fun. Once we reached about age 17 this included playing poker with a shared second-hand chip set, and trying to do beer centurions (the progress in the latter affecting our interest in the former). I was never any good at it because, though poker was a fixture for several years, I was never really able to learn the rules. What hand is good? Why has your hand beaten his hand? But the little pictures are the best, I don't understand! It's disappointing because understanding poker is a cool adult thing, plus not understanding it makes certain pivotal scenes in James Bond films quite hard to parse.
Last week we got an email (shout out Aidan) singing the praises of Aces And Adventures, and I do try to check out recommendations from readers, even if I don't have time to reply or to write about the games. In this case I've made a special because Aces And Adventures is a great game that is teaching me winning poker hands through the medium of a dwarven warrior smashing things.

What's especially notable about this trailer is the animation style, which is quite unique for both the TMNT franchise and animation in general. It's reminiscent of stop-motion mixed in with the comic-style vibes of Spider-Man: Into The Spiderverse, although it's also very much its own thing.

However, its success is only possible through standing on the shoulders of the giants that trailblazed the genre. Of all the franchises Dead Cells drew inspiration from, perhaps no series was as influential as Castlevania. Because of this, the crossover between the two, which comes in the form of premium DLC for Dead Cells called Return to Castlevania, is a natural fit that not only resurrects Konami's dormant franchise but gives a nostalgic shot in the arm to one of the best roguelites available today.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bandai Namco has revealed a new Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi game. 
Yesterday, the publisher released a short teaser trailer for the game, running less than a minute, that highlights footage from previous Budokai Tenkaichi games before showcasing what appears to be the new one. In the footage of the new game, we see Goku powering up. And then the words, "Get Ready For Battle" and "A New Sparking Begins" appear on screen. 
Check it out in the Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi teaser trailer for yourself below:

「ドラゴンボール Sparking！」シリーズ

March 5, 2023
As you can see, the game might be called, in some variation, Dragon Ball Sparking (that's what the tweet calls it if you use Twitter's built-in translate function, too). But regardless, the trailer ends with "A New Budokai Tenkaichi" begins, quelling any doubt that this is a new game in the series that has laid dormant for 16 years. Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi 3 was released in 2007.  
The teaser trailer doesn't indicate if this is Budokai Tenkaichi 4 or something else but it's exciting nonetheless to see that Bandai Namco hasn't forgotten about the series. It is somewhat surprising to see this announcement, though, considering Dragon Ball FighterZ exists. Budokai Tenkaichi is a fighting game series as well but to see a new one before a sequel to FighterZ, which was released in 2018, is something I imagine not many people could have predicted. 
While waiting to learn more about this Budokai Tenkaichi game, read Game Informer's Dragon Ball FighterZ review.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Skyrim came out I was a student, and I worked in Gamestation (RIP) to help pay for chicken noodles. I remember the hype around it very clearly because Gamestation had a deal where you could buy it for like £22, and I had a sideline going when the stock was low to keep some back for my friends. Apols if you were caught in the crossfire for that, but dragon fever was running high off the back of a still very cool trailer, and shouting Fus Ro Dah was the only cure. 
In the years since, Skyrim has been released and re-released many times, on every conceivable platform. "Arrow to the knee" jokes became de rigueur and hacky almost overnight, and at this point might have horse-shoed back around to being funny again. There are many examples of unrelated games or videos that cut to black fading back up into the opening of Skyrim, in a kind of sub-genre of rickroll. Does it hold up now? Kind of. It's a really fun, ambitious RPG, with faults - but if the faults didn't exist maybe it wouldn't have been as popular as it was.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Virtuální Bastlírna slaví 2 roky svojí existence. Pravidelná každoměsíční online setkání s diskuzí nad tématy ze světa vědy a techniky, zejména z praktického pohledu, často ale i s nadhledem a humorem, jejichž tradice vznikla za Covidového lockdownu. Tak jaká témata si bastlíři z projektu MacGyver.sh připravili na toto jubilejní 24. setkání? Určitě bude zmíněna statistika samotné Virtuální Bastlírny. Zajímalo by Vás kolik unikátních návštěvníků se v online prostoru bastlírenského Zoomu již sešlo a kolik bastlířo-hodin prodiskutovalo?

Ze světa HW pak kluci vyhrabali 100 MSa/s osciloskop postavený na RP2040, energeticky úspornou technologii pro přenos dat mezi senzory umístěnými na lidském těle, nové velice levné ARMy pod 5 Kč a nové procesory od ST, požár v továrně na čipy, falešné CO2 monitory, Raspberry debug probe, nový nástroj na tvorbu plošných spojů nebo blížící se semináře a webináře o elektronice.

Za SW zase třeba zbrusu nový KiCAD 7.0.0, emulace zvukové karty Gravis Ultrasound na RP2040, probíhající standardizace šifrovacích algoritmů pro IoT, podpora Bluetooth v Rpi Pico SDK, jak se dělá raytracing na FPGA nebo spolupráce mezi projekty KiCAD a Inventree.

Ať už vás zaujalo cokoliv z nabízených témat, chcete ukázat nějaký svůj bastl a nebo si jen potřebujete postěžovat na nedostatek volného času, dorazte! Příští Virtuální Bastlírna se pod taktovkou projektu MacGyver studentského klubu SiliconHill bude konat v úterý 7. března od 20:00 minimálně do 22:00 (ale obvykle končí o dost později). Odkaz na konferenci se před samotnou akcí objeví na bastlířské wiki.]]></summary>

After the success of Resident Evil, Capcom followed it up with a spiritual successor called Dino Crisis. The title follows a similar blueprint to Resident Evil but ditches zombies in favor of blood-thirsty dinosaurs. The game stars Regina, a special ops soldier sent with a team to investigate an island research facility that has been taken over by these prehistoric lizards. Join host Marcus Stewart with Kyle Hilliard on the sticks as the pair get to the bottom of whatever the heck is happening on this island and blast these critters back to extinction.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last week, I attended a hands-off preview for The Sims 4's upcoming Growing Together expansion pack and its supporting free base game update. This was obviously a real treat for me as RPS' resident Sims fanatic, but I'll admit I went in with my expectations parked in neutral. After all, the theme of this new-content duo is young families, and that just isn't part of the game I engage with too much these days.

        <updated>2023-03-03T18:51:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yosuke Matsuda, president and representative director of Square Enix, is stepping down after 10 years in the position. 
The official announcement states that he’ll be replaced by the relatively new Takahashi Kiryu, a company director who joined Square in 2020, as part of an organizational restructuring. The proposed change will be voted for approval at the 43rd Annual Shareholder’s Meeting in June. Square Enix’s reason for the change is as follows:
Matsuda became president in 2013, succeeding Yoichi Wada as part of a massive restructuring. His time at the top could be viewed as a bit of a rollercoaster. He pushed for innovation in Square’s flagship franchise, Final Fantasy, and voiced commitment to remaking and re-releasing popular titles from Square’s back catalog, such as Final Fantasy VII. The MMO Final Fantasy XIV also became a global phenomenon under his watch, though the company as a whole has largely struggled to land a massive success outside of the franchise. In recent years, high-profile Square Enix-published titles such as Marvel’s Avengers and Babylon’s Fall had disappoitning releases, with the former ceasing development this year and the latter shutting down this week. 
Perhaps most infamously, Matsuda was also at the front of Square’s tumultuous relationships with its North American third-party publishers, namely Crystal Dynamics and Eidos Montreal, whose titles such as the Tomb Raider reboot trilogy, Deus Ex, and Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy were often deemed commercial disappointments. That came to a head last May, when Square Enix sold off these studios and their IPs to Embracer Group.
In recent times, Matsuda was also a vocal advocate for NFTs and blockchain gaming. In January, he published a letter detailing upcoming company initiatives, including making games that incorporate blockchain technology.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Leaks are the bane of every publisher's existence, forcing marketing plans to shift, change, or just get scrapped. But that's partly why I'm enjoying EA's approach for advertising the Skate. reboot. Footage from the open-world skateboarders’ playtest leaked last September, and EA have since responded by releasing their own janky videos. These clips give us a taste of the whacky ragdolling happening right now, and it's probably the most entertaining way of marketing a game while simultaneously sucking the air out of leaks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've recommended a pretty wide variety of genres over the years, but I didn't expect a brick breaking game to surprise me like Destructure Colon Among Debris. It's not that I dislike them. They've just never really made much impression (possibly because I don't see all that many)
Destructure blends in a hint of shooting, resource management, and leans into the sheer fun of destruction, replacing bricks with "structures" that aren't meant to be anything specific, but give the whole feeling an impression of combat, an assault you're carrying out rather than a reacting, abstract geometry game.
Also it feels and sounds great to hit stuff. That's probably the bigger reason.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm going to Japan in a couple of weeks, and I am beyond excited. It's been 15 years since I last visited family in Yokohama, and my last memory is one where I'm miserable and I'm staring out of a cab window going back to the airport. I didn't want to leave. It sounds corny as heck, but I can't wait to sucker punch that memory with a swing that's been building for 5478 days, then jab it full of happy ones. Really, I imagine what will happen is I'll get weirdly emotional as the plane touches down and my mate Simon, who I'm going with, will be like, "Get a hold of yourself you buffoon".
I got LINE recently -  a Whatsapp equivalent that's big in Japan - to arrange some meetups with friends and family. Those arrangements have happened, which brings me great joy. But in a surprise plot twist, it meant I got back in touch with a guy called Sam. Now Sam, he's a good bud and we go a long way back. All the way back to the original Gears Of War days. And I think we've arranged, as is custom, to play Gears 6 whenever it arrives. Such is the bizarre way of things.

It was an insightful look at the nuts and bolts of game dev, so I’m glad Ninja Theory are returning to the concept for the spooky action sequel Hellblade 2: Senua’s Saga. The first episode takes a look at Iceland - the sequel's setting - and the team's painstaking commitment to recreating it as realistically as possible. The photogrammartry tech on display is seriously impressive, and following the team to Iceland feels like watching a British travel series, without the crude humour.

Secondly, you should know that Immortal Empires is, as far as Total War: Warhammer goes, the game mode. More importantly, this ridiculously expansive, years-spanning grand-strategy project exists as tangible proof that sometimes, the limitless hubris of man is actually rad as hell, despite what the ancient Greeks said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo has revealed that Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscribers can jump into Metroid Fusion when the game is added to the NSO library on March 8. 
After surprise releasing Metroid Prime Remastered last month, Metroid fans have another game from the series' history to play through, this time in the Game Boy Advance game first released in 2002. Once Fusion is live with NSO, players can finally experience Samus Aran's full 2D series journey on the Nintendo Switch, starting with the original Metroid game all the way through Metroid Fusion and 2021's Metroid Dread. 
Check out the Metroid Fusion Nintendo Switch Online trailer announcing the news below: 


"In Metroid Fusion, interstellar bounty hunter Samus Aran is attacked by an X parasite while exploring the mysterious planet SR388," Nintendo's description of the game reads. "This organism is not only deadly, but it can mimic the abilities of any creature it infects – including Samus herself! Saved from the brink thanks to an infusion of Metroid DNA, the X parasite's only natural predator, she soon discovers that the parasite has spread to the research station orbiting SR388. Weakened and out of options, Samus must do whatever it takes to destroy the X threat before it's too late." 
Nintendo says Metroid Fusion contains "a multitude of secrets" for players to experience that links Super Metroid to Metroid Dread. 
Speaking of Metroid Dread, read Game Informer's review of it to find out why it was one of our favorite games of 2021, and then read Game Informer's Metroid Prime Remastered review. Check out our list of every NES, SNES, Game Boy, N64, Sega Genesis, and GBA game on Nintendo Switch Online after that. 
Metroid Fusion hits Nintendo Switch Online next week on March 8.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Amazon have quietly dipped their first toe into PC componentS, listing the Amazon Basics Computer Cooling Fan: a single-fan, RGB-lit air cooler. Judging from the manual it supports the very latest socket types for Intel and AMD’s gaming CPUs, and being under the Amazon Basics brand, it's dirt cheap at £21 / £27. 
It’s unlikely, though, that Bezos and the gang have been secretly funding R&D into an all-new line of PC gear. As Tom’s Hardware spotted, the Amazon Basics Computer Cooling Fan appears to simply be an existing budget cooler, the Cooler Master Hyper H410R, without the CM badge.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The overlap of Powerwash Simulator fans and Final Fantasy VII diehards hits in full force today, thanks to the launch of a free DLC pack for the popular sim. You can use your high-pressure hose to blast dirt and grime off of popular locations in Midgar, and the best part is that the experience is totally free.
The Midgar Special Pack is available now for all versions of Powerwash Simulator. It adds five new levels, including Tifa’s Seventh Heaven bar and the Mako Energy Exhibit. Additionally, you’ll be cleaning up vehicles and mechs such as Cloud’s Hardy-Daytona motorcycle, Shinra Hauler, the Scorpion Sentinal, and the Airbuster. The pack also adds new dirt types, such as bio-residue. 


This DLC was created in collaboration with Square Enix, with Final Fantasy VII Remake director Tetsuya Nomura writing in a press release, 
“When I heard about the proposal for a collab, I was quite busy with various other collabs and reviews, but I was especially excited about this one. I had just been playing PowerWash Simulator and was daydreaming about cleaning things from my titles. My immediate response was, 'let’s wash the entire Shinra building.' Unfortunately, that seemed to be a bit difficult, but the final line-up is exciting, nonetheless. This is something I have been looking forward to a lot, and hope everyone has a great time!”
This pack follows a Tomb Raider-themed expansion that launched in January. This is a pretty neat trend, and see other video game properties added to the game that are in need of good clean-up. 
Powerwash Simulator is available now for PlayStation and Xbox consoles, Switch, and PC.]]></summary>

Now though, this 3440x1440 165Hz gaming OLED has dropped in price by a sizeable 26% or £310. That brings the monitor well into three-figure territory at £880, still pricy but a reasonable value given that this Dell monitor is head and shoulders above its IPS, VA and TN opponents.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Panic has revealed that it will hold a Playdate Update showcase next week. 
More specifically, the showcase will air at 9 a.m. PT on March 7 and during it, Panic will reveal new Playdate games and more. The presentation will run for 13 minutes and will also include an update on Catalog, which is Panic's "own curated, on-device and web browser storefront for Playdate software." 
For the uninitiated, Playdate is a piece of handheld hardware that began shipping to customers in April of last year. It's a small device with a black and white screen and a unique crank on the side of it. This crank is integrated into many of the games you can play with it.
Since last April, more than 25,000 Playdate units have shipped to customers. Playdate is not yet availabe on demand for would-be purchasers but you can preorder the device to receive one in the next wave. 
The Playdate Update showcase will air on the official Panic YouTube channel.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Somehow, it's been almost a decade since the last numbered Age Of Wonders game. Despite dipping their toes into the sci-fi realm with Age Of Wonders: Planetfall three-odd years ago, developers Triumph are now returning to their fantastical 4X strategy roots with Age Of Wonders 4, due out on PC in just a couple of months on May 2nd - and what a homecoming it's shaping up to be. I've spent the better part of a week and half playing an early build of AOW 4, getting to grips with its enormous array of customizable factions and hero types in its generous crop of single-player realm maps. 


There's a heck of a lot to get through, but rest assured: this is Age Of Wonders through and through - and thanks to the addition of those new, customizable factions, it's also the most RPG-like entry yet, which is good news for budding D&D-ers looking for a grand, 4X strategy game to sink their teeth into. Heck, I'd even go as far as saying it could be one of this year's biggest and most exciting fantasy games outside of Baldur's Gate 3.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The next game from the studio behind The Surge, Atlas Fallen, was announced last year with a CG trailer that didn’t give much away. A few snippets of gameplay at the end of the trailer revealed speedy action against giant beasts and a semi-open world desert you can slide across - and who doesn’t love sliding in games? We now know when to expect developer Deck13’s latest, as the team have announced a May 16th date for PC and consoles. Publisher Focus Entertainment say a gameplay reveal trailer is “coming soon”, but for now we can enjoy a couple of new screenshots.

With EA asking if people would like remakes of Dead Spaces 2 and 3, and The Outer Worlds getting a remastered Spacer's Choice Edition, we're having a big old thinkeroo about remakes and remasters - including which games we'd most like to see remade.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Given that Dead Island 2 has been in development for the better part of a decade, it’s understandable to have some trepidation about its quality (and general existence). Developer Dambuster Studios hopes to convince players that Dead Island 2 is not only close to finished but is a worthy follow-up by releasing an extended gameplay walkthrough that provides the rawest look at its action. 
The guided demo follows Irish punk rocker Dani, one of the game's six playable characters, and shows off a lot of the moment-to-moment action across various locales. The gory F.L.E.S.H. system is on full display, as is the wacky makeshift weaponry, including electrified Wolverine-esque claws. We also get a look at the card-based perk system and one strange sidequest involving pizza. 


Dead Island is slated to launch on April 21 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. We recently featured the game on our cover and you check out a month’s worth of exclusive features by visiting our coverage hub.]]></summary>

The 17 minute long video showcased various sections from the game, including a late-game boss fight and a greatly expanded early area that sees Leon exploring a series of creepy caves.


As Rock Paper Shotgun's Resident Resident Evil Liker, I took it upon myself to obsessively study each individual frame of this video file to uncover its hidden secrets. Surprising even myself, I was able to extract 17 new details about Leon's refreshed holiday to rural Spain. That's one new thing for each minute of the footage! That wasn't intentional! What a pleasing coincidence!

And it succeeds in a surprising way: by making the rest of Half-Life look older.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Star Wars Jedi: Survivor director Stig Asmussen of Respawn Entertainment wants the series to be a trilogy. 
This news comes from a new IGN Unfiltered interview with the director, which is where Asmussen revealed that even before the release of Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order in 2019, the team was already discussing sequel ideas. For Asmussen, Cal's story has always been a trilogy in his head. 
"We were already talking about the second game," said Asmussen. "I mean, frankly, we were talking beyond. And these are conversations that, when we're breaking this story with Lucasfilm, it's like: 'Well, where are we going with the second game?' I always wanted to see this as a trilogy. How can we take Cal and the crew to new places beyond what we were doing in the first game." 
Asmussen continues, stating that Respawn had a good idea of where Survivor, which is due out April 28, takes place in terms of the Star Wars timeline. The team also knew what the stakes were going to be, what the tone was going to be, what Cal was going to be up against, and how his crew was going to be factored into all of that. On top of that, Respawn thinks about the ideas "that we could do beyond that as well." 
Star Wars Jedi: Survivor was originally due out March 17, but was delayed to April 28. While waiting to get your hands on the game, watch Game Informer's interview with Cal Kestis actor Cameron Monaghan, and then check out our exclusive preview of Star Wars Jedi: Survivor for new details about the story, exploration, and combat.

I'm not the new one in sheep’s clothing, because they haven’t released anything yet. Like many, I was especially drawn to The Wolf Among Us, a neo-noir murder mystery set in the same universe as the Fables graphic novels. It would have been quite poetic to return to the series ten years after its debut, but that’s not going to be paw-sibble, as new TellTale have announced that The Wolf Among Us 2 has been delayed out of 2023. There’s no new release window, but maybe it'll be ready in 2024. Hopefully.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's easy to label Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty as a Soulslike that's basically Nioh and Sekiro mashed together. To some extent, that's true. But I think Wo Long is Team Ninja having sanded off some - not all - of the edges from the overwhelmingly complex Nioh, to craft an action RPG with even crisper combat than its predecessor. And crucially, it's more approachable as a result. Clever ranks and meters reward, whether risk-taking is your jam or you're more of a careful type. It may still be a tricky venture filled with demonic, titanic cows that'll want to pound your skull into the dirt, but this is Team Ninja's most encouraging effort yet.

The console giant will partner up with celebrity fans of the brand to “celebrate their passion for gaming and PlayStation” by creating unique experiences for players. One of those famous names is NBA superstar LeBron James, who helped design a limited-edition PlayStation 5 accessories.
The special console plates and DualSense 5 controller were co-designed by James and will release in select countries. The hardware is adorned with artistic elements (including obligatory crowns) and personal inspirational messages by LeBron. There’s no word yet on the prices, but you can only pre-order these items through direct.playstation.com. sometime this year. You can read LeBron's thoughts on the project by visiting the PlayStation Blog. 
Other big names involved with PlayStation PlayMakers include country music star Jimmie Allen, actor and comedian King Bach, and other professional athletes such as BMX’s Nigel Sylvester, WNBA All-Rookie NaLyssa Smith, NFL stars Ja’Marr Chase and CeeDee Lamb, French football freestyler Lisa Zimouche, and Belgian football star Romelu Lukaku. The initiative feels similar to McDonald's recent push of celebrity-branded menu items, so who knows what to expect from these names and others in the future.
Are you interested in grabbing LeBron James PlayStation 5 merch? Let us know in the comments!
Editors Note: a previous version of the article incorrectly stated that Sony revealed a LeBron James PS5 console instead of console accessories. We've updated the article with the correction.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Telltale Games has announced that The Wolf Among Us 2 has been delayed and will now arrive in 2024. In a statement to IGN, the team explains it wants to avoid crunching the team and releasing an unfinished product as it moves development into Unreal Engine 5.
Telltale released a brief message on Twitter announcing the delay, but CEO Jamie Ottilie shares more context with IGN. Ottilie discusses the challenges of relaunching the studio in 2019, which were then compounded when the COVID-19 pandemic began the following year. That includes announcing the game when the studio was still staffing up to help secure early funding. Despite those early hurdles, Ottilie states that development has been going well since then, but the team recently decided it wants to adopt Unreal 5 to take advantage of the engine’s new features. Unfortunately, that meant having to redo a lot of the work that had been created in Unreal 4.
With such a big change, Ottilie explains that the only way The Wolf Among Us 2 could still arrive this year would be either to launch it in a less-polished state (which the team wants to avoid given its high expectations) or to overwork the staff. Given that the old Telltale was infamous for crunch and burnout, Ottilie is adamant about avoiding the same practice with this iteration of the studio. 
"I've done [crunch], and I don't want to do it again, and it's not fair to ask it," Ottilie tells IGN. "You can't plan a business around it. So yeah, part of it is about maintaining a healthy work culture. We don't want to burn out our good people.”
The Wolf Among Us 2 was announced at the 2019 Game Awards and will be an episodic title like its predecessor. However, Telltale is developing each episode at the same time, so the entire series will be complete when the first installment launches. You can watch the first full trailer from last year here. The studio’s other project, The Expanse: A Telltale Series, is still slated for this year.

This chip launched at $399 but is now $100 cheaper thanks to a discount code at Newegg, where you can pick up the 7700X for $298.99 when you use code BTSCP2655 at the checkout.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[“I was deranged,” says Half-Life writer Marc Laidlaw of his decision to publish the plot of Episode 3 as fanfiction. “I was living on an island, totally cut off from my friends and creative community of the last couple decades, I was completely out of touch and had nobody to talk me out of it. It just seemed like a fun thing to do… until I did it.” 


Laidlaw first discovered that community in the mid 90s, in the office of Valve, where Gabe Newell and team were already hard at work on Half-Life. “I’d seen bits and pieces of the levels they were working on, but as soon as I heard the name, I just got this amazing buzz,” Laidlaw says. “I could see the whole world they were aiming at somehow, and I felt it was a collective vision. This is one reason it’s so weird to me when people try to attribute authorship to me that I’ve never felt. It was all there when I got there, in embryo.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's a sometimes hard to define line between a game that effectively establishes and embellishes its fiction (good, righteous), and one that has "lore" (tedious, lowly). It's a delicate art that warrants close consideration. It also warrants some good examples, which brings us to ΔV: Rings Of Saturn. Which, as it gets closer to release, I'm going to be nice to and call either Delta V or Rings Of Saturn. Even though Triangle Vee Colon Rings is more fun.
It's also fun, having played it, to keep up with how it’s doing in early access, not just because I'm looking forward to seeing it take off, but because its dev has spent the last few years writing delightful patch notes in the style of in-world news bulletins.

Blizzard is going to great lengths to ensure these regions are not only fun for players to explore, but feature more narrative cohesion and a stronger sense of place. 
Diablo veterans have explored regions of Sanctuary before, but this time they’re more than one-note areas highlighting a single climate or element, such as snow or desert. Each of them is biodiverse in its own right, with multiple biomes and threats exclusive to them. These realms also blend more naturally together; the lush green of one area gradually withers…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Electronic Arts has reportedly laid off more than 200 quality assurance testers at its Baton Rouge office in Lousiana. 
This news comes by way of Kotaku, which reports that EA laid off these workers, who worked primarily on the publisher's battle royale Apex Legends, during a surprise Zoom call yesterday. The publication reports that its three sources were able to confirm the news, which began making rounds on Twitter when both current and former QA testers at the Lousiana office began to share what they had learned. 
EA just fired its entire Baton Rouge studio, which is essentially their entire Apex Legends QA staff.
February 28, 2023
Kotaku reports that around 8 a.m. CT, QA testers were invited to an unscheduled but mandatory Zoom call with Magnit Global, which is the contract agency that manages the workers. It was during this meeting that the entire QA team at the Lousiana office was "disbanded," according to Kotaku. 
The publication reached out to EA looking for a response to the mass layoffs, but the publisher opted not to directly address it, instead stating that as "part of its ongoing global strategy, we are expanding the distribution of our Apex Legends testing team and ending execution that's been concentrated in Baton Rouge, Lousiana, impacting services provided by our third-party provider." Be sure to check out Kotaku's write-up for the full statement from EA and additional context surrounding the layoffs, the Lousiana office, and more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the best things a survival game can do is make you want to share your latest experiences with your family and friends At this, Sons Of The Forest succeeds in grand fashion. Often I found myself pausing the game so I could go find my brother and tell him about the latest Big Thing that had just happened. Some of the time, it's even for the right reasons. Perhaps I'd spotted a group of cannibals adopting some startlingly intelligent behaviour. Or maybe one of my NPC companions had just done something particularly endearing in front of me.
Or, more likely, I'd witnessed another example of the incredible jankiness which, like the island's flesh-nibbling denizens, loves to raid and pillage its way through nearly every aspect of the game. Perhaps I'd just cut down a tree and watched it soar high into the air, glitching all over the place like some demonic new type of tree mutant. Maybe Kelvin had just taken my instruction to gather logs a bit too literally, and deconstructed the entire west side of my house while I wasn't looking.
Sons Of The Forest's great strength is its ability to utterly transport you into its threatening, unsettling, but genuinely beautiful world. It quickly builds up the player's trust until they're ready to wholeheartedly buy into what at times feels like the next generation of open-world survival and crafting games. But then, at least in its current Early Access state, it breaks that trust just as quickly with a melange of unintuitive systems, game-breaking bugs, and a painful lack of content that makes one of the most gorgeous environments in games feel awfully hollow after a while.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you’ve paid any attention at all to Final Fantasy XVI, you likely already know how action-forward this game is. It’s easily the farthest a mainline Final Fantasy game has ever been from its traditional turn-based roots, with FFXVI being easily the most action-heavy yet. That’s not surprising, though, considering the game’s combat director is Ryota Suzuki, a former Capcom developer with nearly 20 years of experience designing the action in games like Marvel vs. Capcom 2, Devil May Cry 4, and most recently, Devil May Cry 5. 
With such a personal connection to Devil May Cry, I couldn’t resist asking: Who would win in a one-on-one fight: FFXVI protagonist Clive or Devil May Cry 5 lead Dante? Suzuki had to answer this question with two of his bosses right beside him – FFXVI director Hiroshi Takai and producer Naoki Yoshida – so perhaps we should take this answer with a grain of salt. But I don’t know, having played both Devil May Cry 5 and two hours of FFXVI during a recent hands-on preview (read about that here), I’m inclined to believe him. 
His answer, with a sly smile and a laugh: Clive. 
Suzuki says Clive’s Eikonic abilities, which allow him to tap into the power of Eikons like Phoenix and Titan, give him the ultimate edge. And just for fun, I asked who would win in a fight between Clive and Nero. 
“Clive.” 
There you have it, very specific fans of both Final Fantasy and Devil May Cry 5 like me; Clive wins.]]></summary>

Clive has his own style of Devil May Cry-esque combat, party members controlled by A.I. up the ante, Clive’s dog Torgal can attack enemies, Clive can fight Eikons, and there are even Eikon vs. Eikon fights. It’s a lot for one game to juggle, and after my relatively short preview, I feel that the team is confident in this balancing act. 
But I wanted to learn more, so I asked FFXVI producer Naoki Yoshida, director Hiroshi Takai, and combat director Ryota Suzuki how the team manages so many unique combat experiences.

That "something new" turned out to be FFXVI. The game’s director, Hiroshi Takai, and its producer, Naoki Yoshida, offered Suzuki a role at Creative Business Unit III, leading FFXVI’s combat design. And now, on June 22, players will be able to feel what I felt during a recent hands-on preview of the game: it’s very Devil May Cry meets Final Fantasy, in the best way.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm still not entirely sure if I'm playing Phantom Brigade right. According to its internal clock, battles usually take less than a minute. That time is divided into five-second chunks during which you're shown what the enemy will do, and must use that to coordinate your own mechs, placing their orders on a visible timeline. You finish your turn by hitting a button that makes everyone go at once for a few explosive moments.
In practice, behind those few seconds are an eternity of theorising, testing, and tweaking. There's probably a metaphor in there somewhere about writing, video editing, or catering. The result is a game that's taken me absolutely ages, but whose numbers suggest I'm supposed to be blasting through without a care.
I am enjoying it a lot, despite some frustration.

One facet of FFXVI’s development I was especially interested in is how Creative Business Unit III, the internal studio behind the upcoming game, is able to balance creating this new title while continuing to develop its extremely successful MMO, Final Fantasy XIV. Yoshida, who is FFXIV’s producer and director, says it’s not as different as you might think.

One question asked was about why the game returns to the series’ high fantasy roots, and why it has such a different tone compared to recent Final Fantasy games. 
According to Takai, it all started with summons. 

“So when the project started, I was one of the first people that [Yoshida] came to first and he said, ‘Okay, we have this project called Final Fantasy XVI. Will you be director?’ and his orders at the time of creating the game, he had this very big idea that he wanted to focus on the summons,” Takai says through a tr…]]></summary>

Star Rail's turn-based battles and JRPG leanings might be a bit of a departure from Genshin's open-world adventuring, but it's definitely, 100%, without a doubt, anime as heck. Oh, and very gacha. There's a lot of currencies. So many currencies. Still, I think it's shaping up to be a decent time.

But it’s all too easy to walk past easter eggs without knowing they were even there. I’ve probably waved off multiple fun secrets, mistaking them for lore I didn’t understand or a questline I haven’t gotten to. So, my pea-sized brain enjoyed this video of game designer Steve Lee interviewing the devs behind Skyrim and Fallout as they reveal some dev secrets behind those games - including a cool egg.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know we’ve been bleating on about PC system requirements lately, but the spec demands of Kerbal Space Program 2 also demand a special, visibly uncomfortable mention. This game, fresh into early access and the sequel to one that needed a mere 512GB of VRAM, lists the formidable RTX 3080 among its recommended hardware. That’s a £600-plus graphics card, and for the bare minimum of Low quality at 1080p? That’ll be either a GTX 1070 Ti or a Radeon RX 5600 XT. 


Consternation at the star-high starting specs prompted Private Division community lead Michael Loreno to pen a forum post explaining the requirements, suggesting they were subject to change as further optimisations are added and that "the game is certainly playable on machines below our min spec." Sadly, I’ve been finding that several of the most-used GPUs among Steam users – including the immensely popular GTX 1060 – are likely to face serious performance woes in KSP2’s current state.

If my need for plants were a child, it would have been born. I had a decent pot plant called James Plant back in the UK, but when I moved I bequeathed James Plant to Graham - and, now that I think about it, Graham hasn't told me how James Plant is doing, so I should probably check in on that.
I know that digital plants do not replace real plants in a physical sense - i.e. I am getting no oxygenating benefit from them - but the little plants in Garden In! make me happy. And I've just realised the name is a pun, too.

You won’t find difficulty settings like easy, medium, and hard. Instead, there’s a story-focused mode and an action-focused mode. The story-focused mode will be easier, while the action-focused mode appears to be the default difficulty setting. And within each of these modes, there are special accessories that can be equipped to tailor the difficulty of combat to your liking.

Most of that playtime consisted of me controlling Clive as I battled alongside ally Cidolfus Telamon (always a Cid, right?) through a castle dungeon. However, toward the end of my preview, I was able to fight Garuda, one of the game’s Eikons, while controlling Ifrit, another Eikon. 
At this point in the game, roughly five hours in according to FFXVI producer Naoki Yoshida, Clive has little control over Ifrit. A special few in the world of FFXVI are Dominants, meaning they can tap into the power of an Eikon and even transform into them. Cidolfus, for example, can become the Ramuh Eikon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following the release of Forspoken earlier this year, Square Enix has announced that the game's developer, Luminous Productions, will merge into the company. 
It's a strange announcement, given that Luminous Productions was already a studio under the Square Enix umbrella. But now, it seems that Luminous Productions as an individual entity will be no more and, thus, won't be seeing its name appear on future titles.
"The merger is part of the Company's efforts to bolster the competitive prowess of the Group's development studios, a goal set forth under its current medium-term business strategy," a press release reads. "Square Enix has developed numerous AAA high-definition (HD) games and possesses a wealth of intellectual property (IP) and content. Luminous Productions Co., Ltd. is meanwhile equipped not only with AAA title development capabilities but also technical expertise in areas such as game engine development. Combining the two entities will further enhance the Group's ability to develop HD games." 
As you can see, it's not that Luminous Productions' developers are no longer with Square Enix; it's just that the team has been merged into the wider Square Enix umbrella. As for why remains unclear. Perhaps it's the result of Forspoken's mixed reception at release, but that's speculation.

Carson’s book investigated the pesticide known as DDT, its harmful environmental impacts, and the misinformation that allowed companies to indiscriminately use it. The Forest Cathedral reimagines this series of events as partly a first-person walking sim across the woods and partly a 2D platformer set inside scanning equipment. So, yeah, not exactly a one-to-one adaptation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[How do you remake a game many consider to be a masterpiece? In our conversation with Resident Evil 4 (Remake)'s Director Yasuhiro Ampo and Game Director Kazunori Kadoi, we learned a few of the ways the team at Capcom is attempting this. From quality-of-life improvements and updated controls to a new knife system and parry mechanics, they've done quite a lot; and you can learn about it in the video below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With the new Ryzen 7000X3D processors arriving today, it's perhaps not surprising to see last-gen models reaching new price lows. That's the case for the Ryzen 5700X, one of the fastest eight-core Ryzen CPUs ever made (behind the 7700X, 5800X and 5800X3D) and now firmly a member of the sub-£200 club. In fact, this processor is down to £177 at Amazon UK at present, meaning it's rapidly approaching half of its £329 UK RRP. 
Yes, I know the CPU pictured is the 5800X. Please don't tell anyone! I didn't think you'd look at it that closely.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Buying American imports on Amazon UK is one of the best ways to get a steep discount without resorting to lesser-known sellers, and occasionally you find a deal that is streets ahead of the nearest comparable price in Blighty. That's the case with this deal, where you can pick up Lexar's NS100 SATA SSD in a beautiful 1TB capacity for just £46. 
That's a super low price for what is by all accounts quite a reasonable drive, with read speeds up to 550MB/s, write speeds up to 500MB/s, TLC NAND flash memory and a DRAM-less design.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Oh no, poor Kerbal Space Program 2. The extremely anticipated sequel to everyone’s favourite rocket-building space exploration game is a hot mess. A list of bugs longer than a Saturn V reads like a terrible medical diagnosis: quivering periapsis, unpredictable methane leakage, late-stage separation anxiety, loose payloads, non-stop burning, and sensitive nodes.
The developers, smiling bravely in circumstances presumably beyond their control, describe the launch as like dropping a kid off for their first day at school. Well the kid forgot their lunchbox, their uniform, their books and their pencil case. They showed up at the wrong school, on a Saturday during half-term. If you were stranded on a desert island and had to recreate Kerbal Space Program from memory using nothing but coconuts and string, it would look something like Kerbal Space Program 2. The game is nowhere approaching finished, it barely resembles the promotional videos, and it isn’t ready, even by Early Access standards.

After he left Square Enix in 2003, Sakaguchi opened his own studio and worked on turn-based adventures like Blue Dragon and Lost Odyssey - games that arguably matched his genre-defining classics - but PC gamers have been largely unable to experience them, until now. Maybe. Sakaguchi recently took part in a Q&A (reported by IGN Japan, translated by VGC) where he expressed the desire to bring his Apple Arcade exclusive Fantasian to PC.

It’s also an unexpected remaster, redoing and fine-tuning everything from companion AI and facial animations to weather effects and dynamic lighting. It’s an enticing prospect for a game that never previously counted visuals as its strong suit, though there will be a catch: the Spacer’s Choice Edition will have significantly higher PC system requirements than the 2019 original.

What's happened here is: I've come away with thoughts, but they're thoughts on one of three modes that's the least useful one to have thoughts on. The other two - the bulk of the game - weren't playable. Still, what I did play was simplistic fun that valued chaos over stealth, with middling results. Unless the other two modes wrap up its action in more interesting ways, I'm unsure whether I can see Crime Boss racking up the cash when it releases next month.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This year our project was accepted to the Google Summer of Code program for the eighth year in a row (and 16th time in total).
The intention of the program is to bring new contributors to open source projects, and the eligibility rules for participants are the same as last year, with both students and non-students welcome to participate. Check the  Google Summer of Code website for details of eligibility.
Participants can apply for either short tasks (about 175 hours) or long tasks (about 350 hours). The coding period typically runs from the start of June to the end of August, but there is some flexibility and the participants can opt to use a longer coding period if they are not available to work full time on the project during the summer.
ScummVM is looking for applicants! A list of suggested projects can be found on this page, but we’re open to your own ideas too. Please make sure you provide the required information in your application before submitting. We also strongly encourage you to join our Discord server and follow the #scummvm-gsoc channel where you can engage with our mentors and the rest of the team, and get advice and help on getting started with the project and writing your application.
We have gathered some information to guide you, based on our previous 15 years of experience in the program. You may start your exploration from our Google Summer of Code miniportal.
We are looking forward to your application and participation!
