        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Even though the PlayStation 2 collection is considered one of the greatest of all time, many hidden gems slipped through the cracks. Some titles didn't quite get the attention they deserved, whether due to an overshadowing of a big hit release or a simple overglance. It's time to give them their time in the spotlight with our 10 most underrated PS2 games.


GUN

When you think of Western-styled games, the Red Dead Redemption series is probably the first one that comes to mind. But before this franchise took off, PlayStation 2 had titles like Red Dead Revolver and GUN. While Red Dead Revolver could be seen as a hidden gem, GUN is definitely the more underrated one.


It's curious to me why GUN fell off the radar, especially since it actually feels a lot more like Red …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Last of Us season 2 is on the way, and it turns out we don't have much longer to wait for it. As revealed during Sony's CES press conference this week, the next season is officially set to kick off this April. 


Like the first, the second season will be airing on HBO and streaming on Max. Co-creator, writer, and executive producer Neil Druckmann reiterated that this season will run for seven episodes, which we previously learned about back in June 2024. Along with this news, we got a nice minute-long teaser offering up a look at the next set of episodes.




The season 2 logline paves the way for an adaptation of The Last of Us Part II. Set five years after the first season's events, Joel and Ellie have to deal with interpersonal conflict and "a world even more dangerous and unpredictable than the one they left behind." 


It's been two years since The Last of Us started its nine-episode run on HBO. In the time since its conclusion, we've been reacquainted with the returning cast and introduced to a few of the newcomers. In addition to Pedro Pascal as Joel and Bella Ramsey as Ellie, we'll see more of Gabriel Luna's Tommy and Rutina Wesley's Maria in season 2. As for the newcomers, here's an overview of some of the previously announced cast additions:


New to The Last of Us Season 2 Cast



Kaitlyn Dever as Abby


Isabela Merced as Dina


Young Mazino as Jesse


Ariela Barer as Mel


Tati Gabrielle as Nora


Spencer Lord as Owen


Danny Ramirez as Manny


Jeffrey Wright as Isaac


Catherine O'Hara (guest star)



The first season of The Last of Us was intense, but anyone who has played The Last of Us Part II is no doubt eager to see how they handle some of the darker turns. Thankfully, we'll get to see how it all plays out in just a short few months.

Valorflies are red fairie creatures that glow, and they’re dotted around the entire map to find. Interacting with a Valorfly will double the amount of experience gained in any battle that takes place within one minute of the interaction. However, interacting with a Valorfly also increases the difficulty of the next battle, giving the enemies higher stats than they’d usually have. 


Once you’ve interacted with a Valorfly, it will disappear. However, it will return to the same position within 20 to 30 minutes, allowing you to farm EXP quickly, as long as you know where to find them…]]></summary>

Another day, another 'Switch 2' leak, folks! This one comes from respected accessibility/cultural consultant Laura Kate Dale, who has posted what looks to be a fresh image of the upcoming successor's dock.
Dale states that the image is from a trusted source, and although it doesn't show a great deal in terms of the actual design of the dock, it does include some information on the input and output voltage. Visible on the dock itself, the text states that the input voltage is 20V, while the output voltage is 15V. By comparison, the Switch OLED dock states that both the input and output is 15V.

        <updated>2025-01-07T11:59:39.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Nagi and Isagi styles are two of the three new styles that have been released as part of Blue Lock Rivals' latest update, and you can unlock them to power yourself up further inside the game.


Unlocking new abilities is always a fun job in Blue Lock Rivals. A new style changes the way you play, and they have unique abilities as well. But to use them, you'll have to obtain them first inside the game. Let's take a look at how you can obtain the Nagi and Isagi styles in Blue Lock Rivals.


How to get Nagi Style in Blue Lock Rivals


To get the Nagi Style, you'll have to rely on luck. You will have to try and pull it out of a spin, but the job won't be easy. Being a Legendary Style, the odds of obtaining it will be as low as 2 percent. There are three Legendary Styles, so the odds of getting the Nagi Style are actually approximately 0.67 percent. You can always try your luck with the Premium Lucky Spins, which will raise the chance to 15 percent.


Naturally, it will be an expensive process, and you'll need a lot of spins (unless you get to be super lucky with your pulls).




How to get the Isagi Style in Blue Lock Rivals


The process of obtaining the Isagi Style is the same, and you'll have to hope to get lucky from your spins. However, the Isagi Style is a Rare Style, which raises the odds to 62.5%. There are 2 Rare Styles in the draw, which puts the odds for the Isagi Style at 31.25%. Compared to the Nagi Style, this is a massively improved number, making it quite possible for you to obtain it.


Do note that the Isagi Style can't be obtained from Premium Lucky Spins. Once again, you can always get more spins by using different codes or just by buying them directly via microtransactions in Blue Lock Rivals.

This comprehensive game streaming service has always been rather janky on the Steam Deck, however, which made it less-than-ideal on the Valve handheld. That's all changing, though.


Amidst a dizzying array of announcements made at CES 2025, Nvidia has also published a blog on its upcoming GeForce Now application for the Steam Deck. Up until now, the impromptu "solution" has been to simply install Google Chrome onto the Deck and run GeForce Now that way. This, however, was not only janky but also rather limiting as users couldn't leverage GeForce Now's HDR features or go for frame-rates higher than 60.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are a lot of resources in Disney Dreamlight Valley, all of which can be found in certain locations or at different times. One resource you’ll need if you’re wanting to increase your friendship level with Maui is Worms, but they’re only available for a limited time. 


Worms are required to complete Maui’s level 2 friendship quest “Burying the Eel”. The worms will eventually be used as bait in a Fishing Trap, but before you can place it down in the water, you need to locate the worms and craft the Trap itself.

While you could be forgiven for thinking that the worms needed for this quest will be found on Dazzle Beach, this is not the case. Instead, you’ll need to head up the stairs to Peaceful Meadow. Head to the small ponds in the biome and check the edge of the water. You’ll find some shiny, glittering spots that can be dug up using the Royal Shovel to provide you with Worms. 


Remember, these spots are only available to dig once you’ve reached friendship level 2 with Maui. 


How to use Worms in Disney Dreamlight Valley

Once you’ve got your hands on the wriggly little Worms, you can progress through the “Burying the Eel” quest by using them to craft a Fishing Trap. To do this, you’ll need the following materials:



3 Worms


8 Softwood



After placing the Fishing Trap in the waters off Dazzle Beach, you’ll eventually capture an Eel which you’ll then need to give to Maui. He’ll plant the Eel, and it will eventually grow into your first Coconut Tree. This is the only way you can unlock Coconut Trees in the Valley, and you’ll eventually end up with three of them in total. 


You can also find two Coconut Trees in the Moana realm. Coconut Trees will give three Coconuts every 33 minutes.

The UFO 50 speedrun includes an impressive dart through the retro collection's most bewildering game, the ancient and mysterious Barbuta, in which your character is a frustratingly slow hero with a fearfully short attack range. They managed to complete it in less than five minutes. Not only does the run (and its helpful commentary) serve as a short and sweet explanation of why Barbuta is so glitchily fascinating, it also left plenty of time to marathon another three games from the collection.

One was a cheesy round-up of the best manboobs in video games for Green Man Gaming's long-vanished blog. It was published sometime in 2010, and IIRC, pre-reboot Kratos came out on top. I think/hope it still exists somewhere in the apparatus of Green Man Gaming, hidden beneath the retailer's veneer of respectability like a barrel of radioactive waste. The other boob article was a piece for OXM about Ken Levine saying that he wished people would stop fixating on Elizabeth's cleavage in Bioshock Infinite - a complaint we might consider slightly hypocritical, given the character's visual design.
Now it's time for boob article number 3: some modder has given 122 of the 150 Jokers in cardgame Balatro big chests. This extends from visibly human Jokers to Joker concepts that shouldn't, strictly speaking, have the capacity for boobage. The banana card has boobs, for example. The credit card card has boobs. Behold.

As for price, well the 5090 will be – as you would expect – quite the drain on the ol' wallet. The RRP for this beast will start (START) at $1,999, while the 5080 will be $99…]]></summary>

Sony has just announced that there's a Helldivers film in production, alongside an adaptation of Horizon: Zero Dawn.


You read that right: Sony Pictures is now working on an honest-to-goodness Helldivers film, as shared by none other than Geoff Keighley on Twitter. Further, IGN has reported on an upcoming collaboration between PlayStation Studios and Columbia Pictures to produce a re-telling of Horizon: Zero Dawn, which is in a category all of its own. These announcements kind of overshadowed the smaller one that Crunchyroll will host the upcoming Ghost of Tsushima anime, which is set to release sometime in 2027.…]]></summary>

In case the 'Switch 2' wasn't quite enough, 2025 is promising to be absolutely rife with new PC and Android-based gaming handhelds. It's the Big Thing™ at the moment, and manufacturers are understandably eager to get a foothold over their competitors in terms of power, approachability, and – in Acer's case at least – size.
Yes, Acer has revealed what might be one of the largest gaming handhelds we've ever seen with the Nitro Blaze 11. With a screen clocking in at 10.95 inches, it's a powerful beast with a hefty price tag to boot, costing users a minimum of $1,099.99 when it launches in Q2 2025.

As spotted by IGN, multiple Switch users on social media and Reddit are claiming they've received cases with "googly eyes" inside instead of the actual game card. This eye rattles around like a Switch game card, but when you open the case, it's just sitting there... looking at you.

How to get Star Rage


The only way to get the Star Rage Innate Technique is to roll it when choosing your Innates from the main screen. Unfortunately, Star Rage is a Special Grade Innate Technique which means there is only a 0.25% chance of obtaining it while spinning, which means that with normal luck you will spin a Special Grade every 1 in 400 spins. However, since there are six Special Grades in total, you will need to be even luckier because it's random which one you get. This means if you get luc…]]></summary>

Nearly every Prime item in the game needs Orokin Cells to be crafted, so farming these as quickly as possible can help a lot. Here's how to farm Orokin Cells in Warframe.

Orokin Cells are found on Saturn, Ceres, and Deimos as a possible drop from most Grineer or Infested enemies, albeit with a low chance. Orokin Cells can also drop from any boss in the game, though the rate of this can vary. With all this in mind, missions, where…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you're running a Nightclub in GTA Online and looking to boost your revenue from it, having a celebrity appearance can be immensely helpful.


Nightclubs are certainly one of my favorite activities given the glitz and glam that is associated with it inside the game. Even if you're managing your Nightclub efficiently, having a celebrity appearance is always going to be beneficial. There is an essence of RNG as you can't predetermine which celebrity will appear.


Nevertheless, they're almost always beneficial for your business, and let's take a look at how to attract the in-game celebrities to your joint.


How to make a celebrity appear in your GTA Online nightclub


To attract your celebrities, you'll need to complete certain promotion missions. Go to your Nightclub and login to your PC (in-game) to find Nightclub Management. From there, select "Promote", and you'll begin your promotion mission.



Once the mission has begun, step outside, and you'll find your escort vehicle. Once you enter the vehicle, a timer will begin.


The next job is to reach the next objective but try to avoid damaging the vehicle too much. Especially make sure that you don't end up mowing down the celebrity because that's not going to look too good.


After picking up the celebrity, you'll have to lose the paparazzi. They will be marked on the mini-map, so try and avoid them as much as you can.


After successfully managing to do the last task, you'll have to pick up another personnel for the celebrity.


Once done, you'll have to drop off the celebrity at your Nightclub. Once they have headed inside and spent some time, you'll get a message about the bonus.





Do remember that you can have only one celebrity per night. It's not a mandatory thing to do, but it's always a welcome way to boost your Nightclub's finances.

OP: Sailing Kingdom Tier List


Our OP: Sailing Kingdom Tier List is comprised of unique tiers, in which we have placed all 45 of OP: Sailing Kingdom's heroes. Heroes in the S tier are considered part of the current meta in OP: Sailing Kingdom and are the best heroes in the game. Those in the A Tier are solid options that you can plug into any team and should be used while you work towards those in the S Tier. Heroes in the B Tier are good choices for the early game as well as for F2P players, while those in the C tier are okay at the start but should be replaced as soon as possible. Finally, any heroes in the D Tier are pretty much just to be used as fodder for upgrading your other heroes. Here is our complete OP: Sailing Kingdom Tier List for all Heroes in the game:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With the TOTY promo coming soon to EA FC 25, the NumeroFUT Challenge 1 SBC couldn't have arrived at a better time.


This is the perfect opportunity for you to store as many packs as possible. The latest fodder challenge is extremely easy to complete, and you can do so with items that are already available in your Ultimate Team squad. You'll get a free pack for your efforts, and it could land you with a walkout/promo item if you're lucky.


Let's take a look at how you can complete the challenge and the rewards waiting for you at the end. 


EA FC 25 NumeroFUT Challenge 1 SBC tasks


The NumeroFUT Challenge 1 SBC has one task, and here are its conditions. 


Task 1 - NumeroFUT Challenge 1



Max. Leagues in Squad: 4


Min. Clubs in Squad: 3


Max. 5 Players from the same Nation


Min. 6 Players: Rare


Min. Team Rating: 75


Min. Squad Total Chemistry Points: 27



EA FC 25 NumeroFUT Challenge 1 SBC solutions


The priority should be using items already available in your club, in order to save coins as much as possible. That said, you can also use this solution to complete the SBC. 


Task 1 - NumeroFUT Challenge 1



Conechny ST 74


Clara Pinedo CAM 77


Sarfo CAM 69


Suslov CAM 74


Vesga CDM 77


Duncan CDM 74


Valeri LB 72


Mumin CB 70


Scalvini CB 78


Hugo Novoa RB 69


Gollini GK 76



You can practically get a Prime Gold Players Pack for free of cost. This pack includes 12 Gold Player items, with 6 of them being Rare. Any one of the 12 cards will be rated 82 or higher, raising the chances for it being a Walkout/Promo card.


If I were you, I would just save the pack for two more weeks until the TOTY promo is live and you can try for what would be some of the best items in Ultimate Team.

Its art style wasn’t just well-executed for its time, it’s still considered to be some of the best pixel art to ever grace a cathode-ray tube, while the gameplay is tight and inventive. It is a titan of arcade games.


But there were a lot of them, and they definitely weren’t made equal. While the games by the original developers were all terrific, after SNK’s bankruptcy in 2002, things started getting shaky. However, it wasn’t always bad. In fact, depending on your standards, it was rarely bad, and most of the genuinely terrible chapters in its book are from recent attempts to cash in on its fame.


If you want to get into the series, the advice most would give is to play Metal Slug 1, X, and 3, with sometimes …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the four new fishing areas in the Northern Expedition update that adds the Northern Summit area to Fisch is the Cryogenic Canal. It's a great location to earn some money from fishing in the update and is also one of the four areas in which you will need to complete its bestiary to access some new rewards from the update. Here is where you can find the Cryogenic Canal in Fisch.


Cryogenic Canal Location


The Cryogenic Canal can be found near Camp 3 at the Northern Summit as part of the Expedition update for Fisch in Roblox. More specifically, you can find the Cryogenic Canal at the coordinates 19875, 578, 5642.


This area serves as one of four new fishing locales in the Northern Expedition, and the Cryogenic Canal specifically has two fishing spots from which you can catch a variety of fish. The canal itself is found inside a cave near Camp 3.

Full Cryogenic Canal Bestiary


In total there are ten fish unique to the Cryogenic Canal area in the Northern Summit. Like the other areas, the fish in the Cryogenic Canal each have specific seasons, times of day, weather, and bait types they prefer when you are trying to catch them. Here is the full bestiary of all the fish you can catch in the Cryogenic Canal:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Estefania Banini Flashback SBC is now live in EA FC 25, and you can complete the challenge to unlock a special card for your Ultimate Team squad.


This is the first Banini promo item we have received in Ultimate Team this year. To play with the card, you'll have to complete the full SBC set before it expires. Let's take a look at the cheapest way to solve the challenge, and if you should invest your resources in it at all.


EA FC 25 Estefania Banini Flashback SBC tasks


The Estefania Banini Flashback SBC has three different tasks, and here are the conditions.


Task 1 - Argentina



Min. 1 Players from: Argentina


Min. 1 Players: Team of the Week


Min. Team Rating: 81



Task 2 - 83-Rated Squad



Min. Team Rating: 83



Task 3 - 84-Rated Squad



Min. Team Rating: 84



EA FC 25 Estefania Banini Flashback SBC solutions


Here's a set of solution you can use to complete the latest Flashback SBC in EA FC 25. 


Task 1 - Argentina



Any 9 81-rated items


Any 83-rated TOTW item


Cervi 76



Task 2 - 83-Rated Squad



Any 11 83-rated items



Task 3 - 84-Rated Squad



Any 11 84-rated items



If this SBC didn't require a TOTW item, it could have been a good bargain SBC. I am pretty sure that we will soon be getting evolutions that will allow you to upgrade 87-rated items. Banini also offers decent stats, and the rare Half-Winger++ role if you like that. The Technical+ will work well for her body type, as will the Dead Ball, Finesse Shot, and Rapid. 


However, the requirement of a TOTW item makes the SBC more expensive than my liking. You can still complete the challenge for pretty cheap, but it might make more sense to save as much fodder as possible for the upcoming TOTY promo.

We are now in preparation for the upcoming TOTY promo, and there's never been a better time to win free packs to open in the near future. The latest objective is pretty easy to complete, but you'll once again need to don your investigative hats. The first task is to deduce what the mystery nation is before you can complete the objective. 


Disclaimer: Find out the nation. 


EA FC 25 Pro Open Mystery Nation objective guide


Over the last four weeks of the FC Pro Open tournament, EA Sports has been releasing plenty of Mystery Nation objectives. Let's take a look at tonight's Mystery Nation objective. 



Score three goals using a Finesse Shot with a player from the mystery nation in any UT game mode. The name of the nation will be hinted at during the broadcast of FC Pro Open Matchday 5."




The task is pretty simple: you'll have to deduce what the mystery nation is. Next, use any item from that nation to complete the requirements of the objective. The task can be completed in any Ultimate Team mode, including Friendlies. This makes it easy for all to complete the task and unlock the rewards pretty quickly. 


Based on the clues handed out in the official stream, the Mystery Nation is Japan. You'll have to use any Japanese item to score three goals with Finesse Shots to complete the objective. As usual, you can do so in a single game, or in multiple contests. Once you complete the objective, you'll get all the rewards.

        <updated>2025-01-06T18:28:16.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Much of Balatro's charm comes from how playing cards change with various buffs and peculiar jokers you can unlock as you discover new poker hands. With multiple collaborations ongoing between different games, you can take this charm a step further by making your playing cards look like The Witcher, Dave the Diver, or even Vampire Survivors characters.


How to turn on collab decks in Balatro


You can change the appearance of your Balatro deck by heading into Options, followed by Customize Deck. Here, you'll find categories for each suit, options for high-contrast colors, and arrows to pick between collaboration decks.


Screenshot by Destructoid


You can find the same option in your pause menu if you're already mid-run and want to customize your deck. That way, you won't have to leave the game and potentially mess up your current round.


All crossover decks in Balatro


Currently, Balatro has collab decks with 16 other games:


Spades



The Witcher


Cyberpunk 2077


Shovel Knight


Don't Starve



Hearts



Among Us


The Binding of Isaac


Cult of the Lamb


Divinity: Original Sin 2



Clubs



Vampire Survivors


Slay the Spire


Potion Craft


Warframe



Diamonds



Dave the Diver


Stardew Valley


Enter the Gungeon


1000xRESIST



Since they're split by suit, you can choose which card types to stay the same and which to swap out. In short, if you love one game but don't have an opinion on the others, you can have one or two enabled and keep the rest off.


Unlike decks you unlock through winning runs, using crossover ones won't impact your interest, hands, or discards in any way. They're purely cosmetic, and you can think of them like skins for your decks. You can also use them on any deck type, so you're not limited to using specific ones to see the cards.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Expect lots of PS4 ports.
The tech experts over at Digital Foundry have weighed in on the recent 'Switch 2' motherboard leak, presenting their views on what the apparent compenents included mean for the power and performance of the upcoming console.
If you've been following along with the Switch 2 rumours for some time now, then much of what DF says probably won't actually come as much of a shock. In a nutshell, the team believes that the console will probably be capable of playing any PS4 game, albeit at a slightly lower native resolution. They're also quick to clarify, however, that this likely won't matter with the additional upscaling from Nvidia's DLSS.

There really has never been a better time for streaming. Just about every provider has a platform with a killer lineup, but that can make it expensive (and confusing) to keep up with what’s available where, and ensuring you’re getting the best deal.


Thankfully, Xfinity’s latest bundle options are a great way to ensure all you need to do is bring the popcorn — and there’s bonus incentive for gamers, too.


The company’s Xfinity Internet starts at 300Mbps for just $35 per month, putting them considerably lower than the likes of HughesNet and with better speeds, too. Xfinity Internet also includes Advanced Security features to counter online threats and give you peace of mind.

Those eventually grew into their PCIe shoes, but only after months of dial-shifting driver updates – whereas the flagship B580 promises Nvidia-besting games performance from the off. Even at such a stage in the current graphics generation (the GeForce RTX 5090 and RTX 5080 could be revealed literally tonight, at CES 2025), there is something enticing about that proposition.

We are mere days away from the arrival of the former PlayStation Vita exclusive, Freedom Wars, on Switch. Ahead of its 10th January release date, Bandai Namco has shared a new trailer, setting up the story and showcasing all the fresh features we can expect to find in Freedom Wars Remastered.
The trailer serves as a good starting point for those unfamiliar with the 2014 Monster Hunter-esque action title. Narrated by your AI assistant, Percy Propa (complete with a nasty AI voice, we might add), the trailer explains that Freedom Wars sees you thrown into a dystopian future, where everyone is forced into a life of servitude under a one-million-year prison sentence. Those who want to make it out will have to prove they are worthy on the battlefield, teaming up with other trendy teens to take down massive foes.

Let's see if we fare better this time round: Sonic Galactic is an absurdly accomplished Sonic fangame from Starteam that, broadly, imagines how the Mega Drive and Genesis platformers might have looked and felt had they been made for the Sega Saturn. There's a new demo, if you fancy trying it for yourself. Please find it here on Itch.io.

Paradise is marketed as a third-person game set in a sunny modern city, where you can speak to any NPC via microphone on the street and get stilted responses powered by artificial intelligence. You will supposedly drive sports cars, shoot guns at people, and accrue in-game cash. But its more outlandish claims attracted immediate scrutiny from video creators who found countless inconsistencies in the marketing material. The game has since been removed from the Epic Games Store, presumably for breaking many of the store's rules. But it's still on Steam, and somehow clambering steadily up the wishlist ladder in defiance of its many red flags.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sunshine, lollipops and chainsaws everywhere.
Cutting a bloody swathe through an army of the undead, Lollipop Chainsaw RePOP joins Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered on Switch. Both games complement each other as flawed but enjoyable examples of Grasshopper Studios' beloved catalogue. An idiosyncratic collaboration between Suda 51 and filmmaker James Gunn, Lollipop Chainsaw highlights the unique style of both creators. It’s a hyper-stylised, quip-heavy action game that remains a uniquely demented experience. Sadly, content omissions and some choppy performance hamper this remaster, tainting the colourful mayhem.
The plot is both a perfect representation of its era and a great opportunity to experience Gunn in a goofy horror mode that was stifled when the MCU beckoned. On the morning of her eighteenth birthday, cheerleader Juliet Starling is inconvenienced by a zombie outbreak in her hometown. Luckily, Juliet comes from a long line of zombie hunters, the undead horde is no match for her skills with a chainsaw and a set of pom poms. Unable to save her boyfriend from a bite, Juliet decapitates him and carries his magically animated head on her belt. Together, they must battle through high school and defeat five musically themed dark lords, summoned by an angry goth kid named Swan to end the world.

This past weekend brought us one of the most convincing leaks yet with a pair of photos depicting what appears to be the left Joy-Con from the upcoming 'Switch 2'.
At first glance, it looks pretty much how we'd expected: larger yet with a familiar design, and a new magnetic rail that backs up previous reports on the console's upgrades over the current Switch. Upon closer inspection, however, the Joy-Con may also be housing an optical sensor on the side, right next to the 'SL' button.

That's specifically RPGs with "AAA" budgets, whatever AAA means these days. Cain is, of course, well aware that there are many RPGs from smaller teams that "evolve past the paradigm of violence being the default way in which the player interacts with the world", and that there are plenty of puzzle games, adventure games and the like in which there is no violence at all.

It is, like Dark Souls, a game about equipment and stamina management, but it finds most success as a soulslike in the sensation that you are alone somewhere bad, not able to do very much except hit horrible things in the space between them trying to hit you. It also offers notable moments of lonely, loud footsteps rebounding off cold stone tiles in the seconds after felling some giant man-bastard - one of the subgenre’s greatest un-joys.

Those after a bit more Batman on the go might be in luck since it seems that Gotham Knights is still set for a couple of console releases, and speculation is already leaning in Switch 2's favour (thanks, UniversoNintendo).

Łoziński lists his work on the Unreal Engine 4 "cpu/gameplay optimisation" for the PS5 version of the game, but he also claims to have done the same — as well as "lead, vulkan rendering" duties — on two further, unspecified platforms.

Where the ripple encounters larger masses, such as planets, suns and... other things, it rebounds, riding the weft of stardust back down to Earth. As it returns home, the signal is modified.

One of the biggest surprises of 2024 was undoubtedly the release (and accompanying marketing campaign) of Emio - The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club. It marked the first proper new entry in the Famicom Detective Club franchise since 1989, bringing with it a whole bunch of dark, mature themes that we don't often see from Nintendo these days.
In fact, in a new interview with Inverse, producer Yoshio Sakamoto and assistant producer Kaori Miyachi commented on the game's development, with Sakamoto specifically noting how surprised he was that Nintendo opted to approve the project so willingly considering its more mature content. Miyachi, meanwhile, was significantly more confident:

Developers NetEase had recently doled out bans of up to 100 years to players they suspected of cheating, but in their eagerness, failed to distinguish between legitimate compatibility layers – the software that non-Windows operating systems, like the Steam Deck’s SteamOS, use to run native Windows games – and actual hacks. Per IGN, NetEase have now apologised to the affected players, and lifted the bans.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'll be blunt: the only thing that really entices me about SpaceCraft is that it's from Shiro Games, creators of such robust RPG and strategy fare as Dune: Spice Wars, Evoland, Northgard and Wartales. As a concept, at least, SpaceCraft seems both flavourless and oddly inclined to overplay its own familiarity. I mean, look at that title. Consider its chilly blend of functionality and punmanship. Look at that capital "C", poking out of the middle like the bow on a present whose silhouette leaves nothing to the imagination. You already know broadly what this game involves, yes? Indeed, you do: it's a game about crafting spacecraft, so that you can travel to other planets and craft their resources into other, better spacecraft. This you may do eternally, for there are thousands of planets in store.

I’m busy replaying The Suffering 2 for the sixth time to see a new 15 second cutscene that recognises which combination of morally aligned beginnings and endings I’ve picked. It reads your save from the first game and everything!". Say ‘memory card’ to a youthful, broccoli-maned Fortnite enjoyer nowadays. Go on, I dare you. You’ll be in a home before you know it.
Still, having new toys at regular intervals is one real upshot of our new live-service barrage of ephemeral novelty, perpetually flung at my dizzy eyeballs like gleaming carnival daggers at exhausted spinning wheels. Especially if they’re for the exquisite strategy of Mechabellum. Season 2 released yesterday alongside patch 1.2, bringing with it a new unit and specialist, some reworks, and lots of cosmetic bits I pretend not to care about but then get excited when I unlock a new one.

The concept for Judas is that you're trapped in a computer-run society housed aboard a colony ship, the Mayflower. The titular Judas has managed to break free of the AI-groomed status quo, and is out to start a revolution. "Bioshock Infinite in space", we called it, back in 2022, but Levine says it's more open-ended than either of his Bioshock endeavours, with a greater emphasis on other characters remembering and responding to your actions over time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I think the last time I read an actual, original Garfield comic was in 1998. Since then, my experience of the character has been one long litany of Gar-memes and in particular, Gorefield memes. For those blissfully unaware, Gorefield is a version of Jim Davis’s otiose, lasagna-loving housecat who has broken his comic strip shackles and become a cosmic abomination. Gorefield's manifestations are many: centipede Gorefields, arachnid Gorefields, Gorefields that extend serpentine necks of unfleshed bone towards a cowering Jon Arbuckle, demanding to be fed in a voice that sounds nothing like Bill Murray, a voice as deep and velvety as the eternal Monday before the Big Bang.
In Gar-Type, a free Gorefield fangame from Youtuber and pixel artist LumpyTouch, Garfield has become a planet. The good news is that, unlike many other Gore-variants, this Gorefield is vulnerable to bullets. It falls to ace pilot Jon Starbuckle and his prototype starfighter, Gar-Type D, to save the Earth from lasagnnihilation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Brendan Greene, the modder-turned-millionaire who designed battle royale game PUBG: Battlegrounds, wants to make his studio's next game a "metaverse", although he says he's wary of using the term. The project is called "Artemis" (at least for now) and you won't be seeing it any time soon. That's because the studio is still working on the tech behind it all, and plans to release two other games before it. Meaning it'll be 10-15 years before it actually comes out. 
Greene describes Artemis as an internet-like platform where users create and share things, but doesn't say specifically what those things might be. He doesn't know how his user-led "multiverse of worlds" will be moderated, or how it will prevent copyright infringement, or what makes this idea distinct from, say, Roblox. He is nonetheless "full of confidence".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ekphrasis is a concept from ancient Greece (who bloody loved a good concept) describing the act of creative writing inspired by a work of art. Is a Ryanair Boeing 737 safety manual art? Well, Johnson A Plane Man has done some ekphrasis with it, so I say yes. It’s a short browser Itch game that chronicles the life and times of a man named Johnson, his love for yellow life vests, his existential feelings of confinement (despite the high number of easily locatable exits), and such emancipatory joys that can only be found in yellow slides.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Happy new year all! And what better way to kick off another undignified 12 month crawl toward the next Xmas holiday than with the news that one of my favourite dark fantasy storybook extravaganzas, Ghost Of A Tale, is getting a sequel.
The newness of this news is in question, admittedly. Developer Lionel "Seith" Gallat and his team have been working on another helping of haunted mouseketeering since 2022. But this is the first time they've properly blogged about it, sharing details of a gruelling switchover to Unreal Engine 5 and a couple of new screens. They still haven't updated the title to make the obvious pun, but perhaps a title as pungent with whimsy as "Ghost Of A Tail" is beyond the trumpeted capabilities of Unreal Engine 5.

As long as I get to be immersed in an adventure. I think that's the big theme of my selection box: being grounded within my player character. I want to feel what it's like to hike through canyons with too much sellable loot in my backpack. I want to park my soul in the head of a scared Scotsman way out of his depth, hundreds of miles from shore. The closer I can comfortably fit in my character's shoes, the more I seem to buy into the world they inhabit. Even if that world is constantly glowing a magnificent crimson.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My selection box isn't really a selection box. It's a tray of barely-nibbled leftovers, hastily lifted from my Steam backlog. One of the disadvantages of being news editor, you see, is that I have  developed a goldfish-grade attention span. In my hectic pursuit of the next scoop, or the next Elden Ring update changelog, I snatch and cast aside game demos like a pickpocket speedrunning the checkout line at Harvey Nichols. I'm dimly aware that some of these cast-aside games are Very Good. A few might even deserve to be played for longer than 30 minutes. I feel immensely guilty about that. Perhaps a little... existential, too. I have measured out my life in tutorial levels. 


So! Rather than digging out three of the games I've actually completed this year, such as The Crush House, Death Of A Wish and Mask Quest, I'm going to gamble on recommending a few I've barely scratched, but which sure feel excellent and have attracted a positive critical consensus. If I am false in this assessment, may Horace the Endless Bear bite my head off for my impudence. Let's begin.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a landmark ruling, the Court of Milan has ordered Cloudflare to block pirate streaming services that offer Serie A football matches. The court found that Cloudflare's services are instrumental in facilitating access to live pirate streams, undermining Italy's 'Piracy Shield' legislation. The order, which applies in Italy, affects Cloudflare's CDN, DNS resolver, WARP and proxy services. It also includes a broad data disclosure section.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ho, ho, ho, Santa is in town. And he’s brought a gift with him. Here’s a shiny new package for you to unwrap, containing the first beta version of the upcoming OpenTTD 15 release. It comes faster, with road waypoints, fewer passwords, better scenario editor, and hopefully with a lot less bugs. To be a bit less vague, here are some of the highlights: Improved picker windows for stations/waypoints/objects/and more. Oh, and that does include road waypoints. Better perfomance in various places, including faster path signals that are now green by default. Password-less network authentication using keys. Several improvements for NewGRFs regarding cargo support. Better scenario editor with a town data importer and manual house placement. A large tree fully hung with ornamental bugfixes. Sadly though, not everbody was good this year. The old NPF pathfinder was finally retired, after YAPF being the superior default for many, many years now. There’s a lot of bugs left for you to find, though, guaranteed. Enjoy the beta, test all the things and report anything you find amiss, to make OpenTTD 15 the best OpenTTD 15 ever.

Despite the win, the broadcaster was disappointed that the court had found the company behind Rojadirecta liable, but not company owner Igor Seoane. After the Supreme Court held that Seoane could be held liable, last Friday a court confirmed total damages of $33 million, with Seoane and the company jointly liable for half of that amount.

The only thing missing from his account of the game was the bread needed to make that rich, meaty concoction a tasty, nourishing sandwich.
And by bread, I of course mean the strategic layer - the parts between the turn-based battles where you pick your next mission, improve your squads, deal with pop-up story events, appraise your standing with each NPC faction, and equip your strike cruiser with auxiliary systems. Developers Overhype have now shared a few details of how it all works. Mmmmm, such malty, yeasty strategicalness.

Is usually intended to test out the new and the strange of gaming hardware. Instead, I want to talk about mini PCs – not just small-form-factor desktops, but properly tiny, box o’ chocolates-sized computers – which have, of course, been around for decades.
Recently, however, I’ve been wondering if mini PCs are finally on the cusp of having their moment as serious games machines. Between rising desktop component prices and ever-ballooning electricity bills, it would make sense that a smaller, cheaper system would take on a new appeal, and the success of handhelds like the Steam Deck and Asus ROG Ally show that convenience still trumps out-and-out performance for a lot of PC players. There have even been hints that Valve are resurrecting their Steam Machine mini PC concept, years after a flopping first attempt. Should you be interested?

Its structure most resembles Songs of Conquest or Heroes of Might and/or Magic, but with little RPG emphasis or base building, and minimal tactical fighting.
Taxonomy is arbitrary and often unimportant at the end of the day, but I am very glad to firmly rule it out of one category: It's not a bloody card game. It looks like one, sure. You do most things with cards, and characters acquire more cards over time. But even if you absolutely, utterly, and correctly loathe card-based systems, this game has none.

The embryo expands "lightly as a thought," with spectral continents "sleeting" through walls and people. It surges across the landscape until the entire population and geography of the Disc is exactly duplicated and enclosed by a shimmering shadow-self of "shining threads that followed every movement."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Two men on the board of directors for Epic Games have stepped down from their positions after the US Department of Justice investigated the board under antitrust laws. The pair of directors were originally appointed to Epic's board by Tencent (who slurp upon a minority stake in the Unreal Engine company) but the United States government took a look at this and said: ah-ah-ah, you're not allowed to have a director in your boardroom if they're already fingers-deep in the pie of a competing company. Naughty Tencent! Naughty Epic! And, yes, naughty Riot Games!

The Winter sale that began yesterday is almost identical to the Autumn sale that ended just two weeks ago, for example. But you can still find one or two gifts if you bore deep enough into the ice. Me? I'm only interested in one thing. How many of these games are snowy and chilly enough to induce wonderful hypothermia? I'm on a frostbitten quest to find out. Here are the most winter-iest games you can pick up for cheap.

At least that's what the interstellar pilots of Elite Dangerous are celebrating in the galaxy-sized multiplayer space sim. Earlier this month, the Thargoid menace finally landed in the Sol system, putting earth itself under threat for the first time, not to mention other human homeworlds and colonies. This meant players were invited to drop everything and head for home - to embark on one last great stand against the final, desperate, and dangerous alien attacker: a Thargoid Titan called "Cocijo". Don't worry, they got him.

As a consequence, a number of 11 bit staff are going to lose their jobs, though at least half of the affected development team are being offered the chance to move to other projects, including a few unannounced ones.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At any given moment I am in the center of a wonderful vortex of skeletons. Bones splash and rattle and burst out of the ground in sharp, horrible spurs. My weakest skeletons, sensing their death coming, explode into fire and shards. My strongest skeletons fight so hard and with such alacrity that upon dying, they drag their spirits together and keep fighting as ghosts for a while. Foul little bone scorpions skitter around on fans of legs made from human hands. Somewhere in the middle, almost invisible among the noise, is the character I am actually playing: Path of Exile 2’s mean-spirited, callous, and gleefully enjoyable Witch.
This is a review in progress. It has to be. Even in its incomplete early access period, Path of Exile 2 is a great sprawling mass of a game. Three meaty acts of a planned six act campaign are followed by a trickier return tour through them, before the absurd endgame kicks into gear and the real work begins. If I came to you having played everything on offer I would be wild-haired, bloodshot-eyed and possessing perfect, incomprehensible knowledge. Let’s compromise: I have toured the dark caverns and the antediluvian crypts. I have been killed by various accumulated nasties. I’ve had a great time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The announcement of The Witcher 4 with The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt's Ciri as protagonist has attracted a bit of discussion. Some of the reaction is online toddlers waxing wroth about a video game having a (somewhat older!!!) woman as lead character, and especially, shock, a video game in a series that has hitherto starred a man. And some of it is people commenting more thoughtfully on whether Ciri genuinely makes for a suitable Witcher protagonist, given that she isn't the product of the typical Witcher genetic modification regime (which is heavily tailored towards men), and given that, without spoiling too much, she has gifts that make crumbly old Geralt's sword-and-sorcery skillset look rather paltry. 


Speaking to Eurogamer this week, game director Sebastian Kalemba and narrative director Philipp Weber responded to a few of these comments, and also shared a little about Ciri's situation at the start of the game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["We are a people who honour democracy," said the dog, scratching himself. "Per our custom, you may drink of our fresh water." The dog was called Senator Umeshefaat, and he was very civil, even if he was shedding his black and white fur everywhere. We spoke in his home village at dawn. Later, I examined the senator's personal history more thoroughly and discovered he was "hated by bears for cooking them a rancid meal." I suppose every politician has their enemies. 
That Caves Of Qud creates fun anecdotes out of simple encounters shouldn't be a surprise. It has had 15 years of early access to establish itself as a small-but-mighty story generating roguelike of repute (there's a reason it sits deservedly side-by-side with Dwarf Fortress in the same publishing house). After creating many characters, and dying and dying and dying again, I understand why it grips the brain with such fierce glee. It is a machine of grand imagination and adventuresome comedy. A deceptively powerful RPG that isn't half as obtuse to newcomers as the screenshots make it out to be. Qud's low-res bark is just a complement to its bite.

Sony and Kadokawa were reported to be in talks last month, fomenting all sorts of speculation about, say, the PC version of Bloodborne being ritually sacrificed to consecrate the PS6-exclusivity of Dark Souls 4. Now, the pair have emerged from the Cave of Haggling and announced... "a strategic capital and business alliance agreement". What does this mean? Is it safe to scream yet?

Previously, on my mission to survive S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl with only wild mutants as my weapons, I’d discovered clues that someone else was attempting to tame the Zone’s beastly inhabitants. With one of their electronic tracking collars in hand and absolutely no preexisting knowledge of their location, I set out to find this kindred spirit, only for the Zone to once again slam a door in my face.
A cold, steel, very literal door to boot. It turns out that the scientist’s laboratory is locked up tight, and will remain so until I delve about twenty hours deeper into the faction war that’s bubbled up while I’ve been running around throwing irradiated rats at people in tracksuits. Fine. Fine! But I’m keeping the collar.

Since then the modding team has grown to 40 people and the scope of the mod's features has ballooned. It's now going to include new moves, stages, costumes, and a chaotic-looking 2v2 multiplayer tag team mode. All good news for biff 'em up sickos, as the mod is due to release on Friday.

In yet another hollow display of solidarity and "Liber-tea", they've teamed up with the loathsome fascists of Killzone, the elderly shooter series from Sony and Guerrilla Games.
From today, you'll be able to buy weapons, armour and cosmetics belonging to Killzone's despicable stormtroopers from the Helldivers Superstore, and there's the suggestion of an additional Killzone-themed reward depending on the fortunes of the so-called Galactic War, a xenocidal bloodbath couched as an exercise in bringing "freedom" to the upstanding socialist Automatons, the blameless wildlife of the Tyranids, and the Wellsian cosplayers of the recently added Illuminate faction.
We here at Rock Paper Shotgun stand against Super Earth and Arrowhead's wanton aggression, which absolutely isn't a big satirical joke based on some Verhoeven film or other. Anyway, those capes. Find an image and further details below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Times Of Progress is a special game for me, because it's the first news tip I have ever received from Sin Vega, Prime Minister of Strategy Gaming. Sin once described writing news articles for our former news editor Alice0 (RPS in peace) as like practising backflips in front of the kung fu master. Writing about a new city builder at Sin's suggestion is like being invited to budget the development of Londinium by Julius Caesar.
The terror of screwing it up - together with other, more trivial distractions, like international games industry conferences - has stopped me from writing about Times Of Progress for months. Today I bite the bullet, and emerge from my lodgings to issue a hesitant speech to the masses, hoping like hell that Caesar is too preoccupied with the latest Gaul uprising to notice my errors.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Toy Box sounds like a very Xmassy game, but then you watch a trailer, and realise that it is not very Xmassy at all. It's a free visual novel with a macabre puzzling element. The setup is that you're a toy inspector working for a jovial Grand Toy Maker, his face hidden above the top of the screen. Your job is to disassemble toys - five in all - according to his eldritch written instructions, and either "salvage" them or "sentence" them to the incinerator.

If you missed the reveal, perhaps because you value sleep over the spectacle of Geoff Keighley's fashion friends, let me catch you up: in Nightreign, you pick one of eight preset characters and explore a parallel-universe version of Elden Ring's Limgrave map, fighting lesser foes and levelling up quickly so that you can battle a boss at the end of each 15-minute in-game day.

Dispatch is a story-focused strategy game where you’ll play a broke superhero trying to get himself a new mech suit by working at a hero dispatch center. Having trouble tracking a trailer down for this one, but you can find it here on Steam.
Wait. I’ve found it! Leaving that last bit in though. Consider it my gift to you reader. The gift of visible workflow at 4am.
