It's not every day a video game company embraces memes with open arms, but that's exactly what's going on at Sega when it comes to the Sonic the Hedgehog series - in fact, it's arguably helped revitalize the brand over the years.
Ahead of the release of Sonic X Shadow Generations and the Sonic the Hedgehog 3 movie later this year, Sonic Team head Takashi Iizuka recently touched on all the Shadow and Sonic-related memes during a chat with Polygon. First of all - yes, the team sees fans posting "lots of interesting stuff".

With that said, we have suggested some of the best quality and performance settings for Star Wars Outlaws on PC.

Your character choice is important as each character has its own unique skills and combos. We've put together a Shonen Smash Tier List for all Characters currently in the game at the time of release.

Shonen Smash Tier List


There are just shy of a dozen characters available in Shonen Smash at launch, each with their own skills, combos, strengths, and weaknesses. We've put together a tier list for all of the current Shonen Smash characters based on their current ability. 


Our characters in the S Tier are the strongest, with the potential to do devastating one or two-shot combos. Characters in the A Tier are strong enough that once mastered, they can stand on near-even footing with the S Tier characters. Those in the B Tier have some strengths or combos that are powerful, but overall fall short compared to the rest. Finally, the characters we've placed in the C Tier are a bit under tuned at the moment and shouldn't be used until they receive a balancing update. Here is our Shonen Smash Tier List for all characters:


S Tier



Brawler


Kaz


Luffy


Mage



A Tier



Goku


Naruto


Swordsman



B Tier



Flamecharmer


Ichigo



C Tier



Nanya


Yu Narukami

Reggie Fils-Aimé was already a big gamer before he signed on as Nintendo of America's president, but we never really saw much evidence of it. Now, multiple years after exiting his role at the video game giant, he's rediscovered some of his Nintendo 64 collection.
As you can see in the photo below, he's got some fantastic taste - with gems like The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time on display, Rare's GoldenEye 007, and what appears to be the original Paper Mario game. We can also see Blast Corps and Conker's Bad Fur Day. Outside of the container you can also see games like Majora's Mask, Resident Evil 2 and Jet Force Gemini.

Game Science, developer of Black Myth: Wukong, has mentioned in the patch notes that it has “slightly reduced” the stats of Yaoguai King "Captain Wise-Voice," but the developers did not expand upon the details of this nerf.


Some players have found difficulties in dealing with the boss, the most common problem players experienced during this fight was the movement of the camera which made it tougher for players to see close-range melee attacks coming. 


A Reddit user wrote that the boss has "a couple of moves to watch out for," but the "camera can be a little bit of a pain at times.…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo has announced that it's now ending support for the New Nintendo 3DS console because it's run out of parts. As per VGC, the company made the announcement on August 28, 2024, which means you've got to hold yours close and protect it and maybe watch a YouTuber repair a few just in case you need to do it yourself.


This news follows a post from early 2024 on Nintendo's Japanese website, in which it explained that the service repair regulation requirements had expired for the New Nintendo 3DS, New Nintendo 3DS LL, and the Nintendo 2DS. All this meant was that the company no longer had to offer repair services under consumer law. However, Nintendo continues to offer the service for the devices for which it has parts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Acclaimed indie puzzle platformer INMOST is getting a 70% charity sale to help its recently hospitalized composer Alexey Nechaev with his recovery costs. 50% of the proceeds will be going to Nechaev and his family, while the other half is headed to a heart health charity. 


At just 29 years old, Nachaev was sent to hospital after a severe heart attack. He has now been diagnosed with a heart defect and is recovering. "Before his hospitalization, he was managing four projects simultaneously, with converging deadlines across multiple projects," explained Chucklefish in a press release. "Even after being resuscitated, his immediate concern was completing his work, instead of focusing on his health."


INMOST will be on sale until September 12. The sale will end on that morning at 10 AM Pacific Time. If you already have the game, Chucklefish suggests getting the soundtrack, which will provide Nachaev 100% of the profits. 




The indie publisher behind the Wargroove series says it has committed to a zero-crunch policy and switched over to a four-day work week. It states in the email that "these significant cultural shifts have resulted in a happier and healthier team, free from the stresses of creative burnout."


"We recognize that each developer, studio and team has unique requirements, but we hope that by sharing Alexey’s story we can encourage the broader games industry to adopt more proactive health and wellness practices," said Chucklefish. "It is imperative to avoid the unfortunate stories of burnout and stress-related issues that have plagued so many, including well-documented cases such as Alexey’s, and countless others."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are a handful of secret dragon bosses hidden throughout Black Myth: Wukong, and Red Loong is the one that lurks in the forests of chapter one. 


Red Loong is hidden very close to the start of the game, but you won’t actually be able to fight the dragon until you’ve made your way through a portion of chapter two. That’s because you need to find the Loong Scales before you can unlock the secret area where Red Loong lives. The Scales are inside a chest behind a breakable wall in the First Prince of Flowing Sands boss arena. After you’ve collected them, you’re ready to go dragon hunting.

How to find Red Loong


To find Red Loong, you’ll need to travel to the Outside the Forest shrine. Follow the path forward past two enemies until you reach another enemy guarding a wooden bridge. Defeat him, then jump off the bridge and follow the stream to your right. You know you’re heading in the right direction when you start hearing a disembodied voice speaking. Travel far enough upstream, and you’ll find a waterfall that’s pouring into the forest. 


Screenshot via Destructoid 


If you have the Loong Scales in your inventory, you’ll have the option to interact with the waterfall when you approach it. The Scales would cause the water to disappear, and behind it lies the entrance to Red Loong’s boss arena. I’d recommend waiting until you’ve cleared most of chapter two before circling back for this boss fight because it’ll make the encounter much easier. 


With that said, Red Loong isn’t a particularly difficult boss. It mostly relies on tail swipe attacks and a couple of different stomps. The main thing you need to worry about is electricity damage building up over time. Craft some Shocking-Quelling Powder at a shrine, and you should be just fine.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you’re one of the many players who carefully curate their character’s look, you might find it agitating when your stylish outfit is suddenly replaced by bulky profession gear the moment you start crafting.


Fortunately, Blizzard has provided a way to disable the automatic appearance change, allowing you to enjoy your transmog without interruption in WoW: The War Within—here’s how.


How to toggle off Profession Equipment in WoW: The War Within


When you do any sort of crafting-related activity, your profession equipment appearance is automatically enabled, which can be annoying if you like your transmog. To turn off the appearance of profession equipment coming on once you start making stuff, you have to toggle it off manually via an NPC, similar to previous expansions.


For The War Within, that NPC is named Mahra Treebender, located in Dornogal, the man hub. She can be found next to the Crafting Orders area in Dornogal, (/way 58.02 55.25), and she's pretty difficult to miss because she's a Tauren. She also has the title 'Profession Equipment Specialist', which is kind of its own giveaway, really.


Screenshot by Destructoid


Mahra's entire purpose is to toggle on and off the appearance of your profession equipment, and to do so, start by talking to her. You'll be given three different options to toggle on/off your crafting, gathering, and fishing equipment. These are all separate, so make sure to toggle the ones you want off if you don't want to their gear appear. Personally, I like my Windwalker's transmog, so I've turned all of the options off in favor of it. You can also turn them back on at any time at Mahra.


Once you've done this, no longer will profession equipment plague your appearance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Brawl Stars' Spongebob Squarepants update introduces the new Brawler, Moe, a Mythic Damage Dealer. Those who unlock this small but mighty rat get ahold of his all-powerful Driller, inflicting high-damage attacks. In this guide, we'll show you the best Moe build in Brawl Stars to improve his overall performance.


What is the best build for Moe in Brawl Stars?


For the best Moe build, equip these items in Brawl Stars:



Gadget: Dodgy Digging 


Gear: Damage 


Star Power: Skipping Stones


Gear 2: Health/Shield



When comparing Moe's Gadgets, Dodgy Digging is the stand-out choice, increasing his Super charge rate by 50 percent for five seconds. You'll unleash more damage this way, especially when you pair it with the Damage Super Rare Gear. Both tools make Moe extremely OP, and you may even get some one-shot eliminations.


Use the Skipping Stones Star Power to increase Moe's damage rates further, adding one more bounce to his basic attacks. But, if you'd rather boost his movements, switch it out for the Speeding Ticket to increase travel speed.

There are a lot of ways you can go about the last Gear option, including Speed, Gadget Charge, and Shield. To help with Moe's survivability, choose Health or Shield. Both options work well with Moe, as they significantly heal this Brawler.


Once you dive into the battlefield, utilize Moe's basic attack, Shovel Slinger, to throw rocks at your opponents. The more you use it, the more you'll level up to his Super Form, Driller. This form utterly annihilates everyone on the field, thanks to its increased movement speed and damage rates. Fortunately, Moe is just an all-around heavy hitter, giving you the confidence to dominate multiple matches.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Like in previous seasons, Fortnite Chapter 5 Season 4 players can get a few high-quality drops and good sums of gold by finding and then completing the many Shadow Briefings scattered across The Island.


But although featured in a large number, finding the briefing stations will demand a little bit of searching, especially if you are playing solo. So that you can easily find each of them, here are the locations of all Shadow Briefings in Fortnite, as well as how to accept them.


All Shadow Briefing locations in Fortnite Chapter 5 Season 4


As you can see in the image below, courtesy of the Fortnite World Interactive Map, you can find a total of 43 Shadow Briefings in Fortnite, divided between 8 Vehicle, 12 Plunder, 10 Supply Drop, and 13 Armory Briefings. After you get close to any of the stations, a terminal icon will appear on your map and mini-map, signaling its location. Keep in mind that most of them will spawn at random, so don't expect all 43 to be featured in a single match.

How to accept and complete Shadow Briefings in Fortnite


After finding any of the stations above, you will be able to accept its Shadow Briefing by simply interacting with it. Although their tasks will vary, all briefing types will follow the same pattern. You can check out how to complete each Shadow Briefing below:



Armory: By clearing a random task with a specific weapon type, such as dealing a set amount of damage. You will be provided with the weapon.


Supply Drop: By heading to a specified area and securing a supply drop.


Treasure: By heading to the specified areas and digging a treasure chest.


Vehicle: By driving a set distance. You will be provided with a car.



Now that you know the location of all Shadow Briefings in Fortnite Chapter 5 Season 4, I also highly recommend that you check out how to talk to Captain Jones about the next steps.

        <updated>2024-08-29T19:02:51.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Studio Sai has announced the Nintendo Switch release date for its dating sim slash action game, Eternights. It’s coming on October 20, 2024, and a trailer has been released alongside the announcement. The trailer doesn’t look great.


I reviewed Eternights last year at launch. It was fine. I didn’t really love it, and I haven’t thought about it much since. It’s a small production that swings high. It’s successful in a lot of ways but disappoints in areas that really count. However, it did find an audience, as it has reportedly sold over 200,000 copies, and some people really dug it. It just didn’t get my thighs grinding.




It was a pretty decent-looking game on PS4 and PC, but it looks like it might struggle on Switch. The graphics were already murky on other platforms, but on Switch, it’s difficult to see what’s happening. The framerate also seems to struggle in a number of spots. However, this is sometimes just a side-effect of streaming video, but then there’s a scene early on (0:34 mark) where a piece of the background just disappears, as though it’s on the border of the draw distance and can decide whether it should be showing.


Now, to be fair, it’s still nearly two months from release, which is plenty of time to get things polished to a brighter glow, but I’m just not optimistic based on what I’m seeing. There have been a number of great looking ports that have fit games originally released for more powerful hardware onto the Switch, but there have also been less than acceptable results. Hopefully, Eternights winds up leaning more into the former category.


Eternights is available on PC, PS4, and PS5 right now. It will release on Switch October 20, 2024.

Here is how and where to find The Undersea for the Explore Hallowfall achievement in The War Within.





Where to find the Undersea in Hallowfall


You can find the Undersea and complete the part of your task for the Explore Hallowfall achievement by skyriding over the small inlet of an ocean that comes in between the Priory of the Sacred Flame and the Veneration Grounds on the west side of Hallowfall.


Many players are having trouble finishing the Explore Hallowfall achievement in World of Warcraft: The War Within because they are missing the task that requires them to find The Undersea. If you look at the map, you'll see a giant swatch of empty space to the west of the Hallowfall zone that looks like a big body of water, perhaps even an ocean.


For some reason, skyriding over the actual vast expanse of the ocean to the west—which yes, will build fatigue—does not seem to actually credit players with finding The Undersea. You'll need to specifically fly around in the area that's attached to the Hallowfall zone, which separates the land between Mereldar, the Veneration Grounds, and the Priory of the Sacred Flame.


Once you reach that area, The Undersea location should be discovered thus completing your Explore Hallowfall achievement. If this is the last zone you need to fully explore, you'll also complete the Explore Khaz Algar achievement in The War Within.

A Tyranid threat is slowly consuming a planet, and you're the only thing standing in the way of it spreading further into the Imperium. 


The game has a full campaign that can be played solo or in co-op, as well as a PvP game mode that throws players into the roles of Space Marines and Chaos Space Marines and lets them duke it out for supremacy. These game modes are available across PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X, and the game supports crossplay and cross-save for the most part. But there are a few caveats that you might want to know about before deciding which version of the game you buy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you're still grinding in EA FC 24's Ultimate Team mode, the Pre-Season Champions Play objective set brings two great additions. 


By completing the latest objectives, you can get two amazing promo cards for free — a 99-rated Rodrigo De Paul PTG and a 98-rated Jairzinho FUTTIES Icon. Both items have been released as part of their respective promos, but everyone is guaranteed to get them after completing a few simple tasks.


EA FC 24 Pre-Season Champions Play objective tasks


The Pre-Season Champions Play requires you to complete the conditions by grinding the Champions mode. There are seven different tasks, and they have certain conditions. 



Play 6: Play 6 matches in any Champions Game Mode.


Play 10: Play 10 matches in any Champions Game Mode.


Play 13: Play 13 matches in any Champions Game Mode.


Play 16: Play 16 matches in any Champions Game Mode.


Play 20: Play 20 matches in any Champions Game Mode.


Win 5 - FUTTIES: Win 5 matches in Champions Finals while having min. 7 FUTTIES players in your starting 11.


Win 10 - FUTTIES: Win 10 matches in Champions Finals while having min. 7 FUTTIES players in your starting 11.



You'll have 40 Champions Finals and 30 additional Playoffs games to complete all the tasks. Jairzinho's FUTTIES Icon is part of a specific task, while De Paul's PTG is the group reward. 



Jairzinho FUTTIES Icon - just complete 20 matches in any Champions mode (both Finals and Playoffs). 


Rodrigo De Paul PTG - Complete all seven tasks. 



Both cards are pretty good even when EA Sports has been releasing 99-rated cards in packs and SBCs. Hence, make sure to complete the objective set to finish EA FC 24 on a high.

An Episode in Valorant usually lasts around six months in total, with three Acts per Episode, each lasting roughly two months, allowing players the time required to get excited for new content, enjoy it, play far too much of it, and repeat the cycle. Seasonal content models can feel awkward, especially if missions are time-gated, as they were in Destiny 2.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Each of Disney Dreamlight Valley's biomes has its own unique array of fruits, gems, and flowers you'll collect throughout your playthrough. What you find in one region will differ from another, especially as you advance through the story and unlock new items.


However, Dazzle Beach has one berry type you'll find immediately after opening it, and it's surprisingly easy to forget about it if you've since created an orchard or obtained other fruit types. Let's find out what berry type you can find along the beach for your Star Path duties.


Where to find Dazzle Beach berries in Disney Dreamlight Valley


The only berry native to Disney Dreamlight Valley's Dazzle Beach biome is blueberries. At the beginning of the game, you'll find a few blueberry bushes and banana trees around the area, with coconuts appearing shortly after. 


Screenshot by Destructoid


Alongside Dazzle Beach, you'll also find blueberries in the Forest of Valor. You'll unlock this biome shortly after opening the beach, making it easily accessible in the early game. The location of the blueberry bush doesn't matter, so you're free to collect the ones from the Forest of Valor or create an orchard in another biome if you'd like. Otherwise, taking a quick visit to Dazzle Beach and picking some berries will help you progress through your Star Path duty.


Outside of Star Path objectives, blueberries are also a valuable item for cooking. It's a mandatory ingredient for several recipes, including blueberry pie and Stitch Cupcakes, and can be used as an optional item in any recipe that calls for "any fruit". They also have base values of 29 Star Coins and 350 energy if you want to eat or sell them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[5PM Studio has released their city-builder Memoriapolis onto Steam Early Access today. The planned timeframe is 4-6 months, and currently features the ages of Antiquity and Medieval out of a planned four.


Memoriapolis is a classic city-builder whose main hook is the way in which it progresses through historical eras. From Antiquity to the Age of Enlightenment. Along the way, you build production, cultural, and military buildings to keep your citizens happy and in their lane. You know, city-building stuff.


The feature that stands out to me most about Memoriapolis is the fact that you don’t build the roads yourself. In any city builder where you’re given control of where pavement gets laid down, it invariably leads to grids. At least it does in my case. I’ve learned to force myself to curve roads and avoid symmetry, even when it isn’t as efficient. The focus is on organic growth.




It’s certainly a lavish trailer they put out with the announcement as well. I tend to love city builders and management games, but I’m not sure that I can fit another one in. Not that I wouldn’t want to. Memoriapolis looks pretty solid. But I already keep telling myself to get back into Farthest Frontier. I just can’t find the time. Maybe I need to stop sleeping.


Memoriapolis is available on Steam Early Access starting today.

Konami has been making waves this year with its upcoming duo of high-budget remakes of Silent Hill 2 and Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater. For Castlevania fans, however, it’s been a bit of a quiet one, with seemingly no sign of any new entry in the long-running gothic franchise.
Despite this, the publisher has been trickling out compilations of its older Castlevania games, starting with the Anniversary Collection in 2019 followed by the Advance Collection in 2021. Now, Castlevania Dominus Collection brings all three DS entries to the Switch in one handy package, meaning fans now have access to pretty much every Castlevania game worth playing on one system. Right..? Right? Sigh… C’mon, Konami, just give us Symphony of the Night, for goodness' sake.

        <updated>2024-08-29T16:59:41.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Deadlock is great whenever it's online, but it's not quite so fun when the servers go down. Excluding Friday and the weekend, the servers are down for around a dozen hours daily. That's a lot of time we're left unable to play. However, it doesn't have to be that way. 


Thankfully, there is a slightly janky way around the game's downtime. Here's how to change your region in Deadlock so you can play it 24/7.


How to switch your in-game region in Deadlock


Image by Destructoid


To change your region, you'll first want to launch Deadlock and get to the main menu. Once there, press the F7 key and type in the following command depending on the region you want:



citadel_region_override 0 (North America)


citadel_region_override 1 (Europe)


citadel_region_override 2 (Asia)


citadel_region_override 3 (South America)


citadel_region_override 5 (Oceania)


citadel_region_override -1 (Automatic)



Doing any of these commands will switch you to your desired region. When you want to switch back, just put in the command for your home region and you'll instantly be swapped over. If you're trying to play whenever you want, Deadlock is available from 2 PM to 3 AM from Monday to Thursday and 10 AM to 3 AM from Friday to Sunday for each region. This automatically adjusts to your local time, so you shouldn't need to do conversions of any sort.


While this is all awesome, there is one major caveat to consider. When switching regions in Deadlock, you'll be connecting to other servers in those regions. That means your base level of ping is going to skyrocket, so you might have to deal with up to 200 ping by default. Whether that's something you're okay with handling for the sake of playing more is up to you. As for me, playing Grey Talon with that level of ping sounds like a recipe for disaster.

The latest Japanese charts are in, courtesy of Famitsu, and it's an expectedly quiet week as we prepare for the stacked September release schedule.
Despite only shifting an additional 10,198 units, Powerful Pro Baseball 2024-25 has held onto the top spot for the fourth week in a row. To be honest, things are equally unremarkable elsewhere too. The familiar faces of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, Nintendo Switch Sports and Animal Crossing: New Horizons continue to prove that no amount of slow sales will boot them out of the top 10, while last week's newbie That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime ISEKAI Chronicles is nowhere to be seen.

The game was a bright spot in a bad time, which might seem peculiar given that Sluggish Morss often looks like a whale's upset stomach, but it's such a feverishly inventive creation. It blew the dust from my synapses.
The same appears true of King-Spooner's upcoming Judero, on which he is collaborating with Soul Searching developer Talha Kaya. It casts you as a "pagan seer" armed with a big stick, who is searching the mythical Scottish borderlands for evil creatures to clobber. It looks cheerier and airier than Sluggish Morss, with a more overt emphasis on mechanics such as combat, but it has the same pickled 3am energy to it. It's also now got a release date - 16th September - and a new trailer below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stepping out of the shadow.
Though Ninja Gaiden occupied the spotlight on the NES back in the day, there was another similar ninja action game called Shadow of the Ninja which proved to be just about as good and featured two-player co-op. Due to publisher issues, a planned Game Boy version was repurposed as a Ninja Gaiden prequel and a sequel was never made, so the original release slowly faded into obscurity while Ryu Hyabusa continued getting more new games.
Not ones to let a good game be completely forgotten, the passionate developers at Tengo Project have brought this classic back for modern players as Shadow of the Ninja - Reborn. Sporting a gorgeous new art style and some additions and tweaks to the core gameplay, this reimagining of the ‘other’ NES ninja platformer offers up a fun and brutal return to basics.

The opening radio chat between starting squad member Sid and a pal has that telltale charming tinge of overeager cockney. It also contains the words “bloody” and “arse” in quick succession, though thankfully not next to each other. The only piles are the logs Sid’s crouched behind as he prepares to sneak up to a cable car guarded by Nazis. That is the only haemorrhoids allusion I will ever make on this website. Until the next time I have to write about Andrew Wilson.
“Oil just use my trusty knoife” mutters Sid as I take down my first guard. Straight away, the animation and noise indicators evoke the same Shadow Tactics or Desperados III goodness you’re probably expecting. Fine with me - that’s exactly what I’m here for. Mimimi’s closing was a real gutpunch, and while I don’t expect anyone to match their exceptional work any time soon, it’s at least reassuring to see Warsaw studio Artificer picking up the torch.

Publisher Cinemax Games and developer KO.DLL have today announced that the retro-inspired platformer BZZZT will be leaping to Switch on 19th September.
This one first hopped onto our screens in the April 2024 Indie World showcase, with its pretty pixel art and toe-tapping bit soundtrack making it seem like an ideal fit for Switch. Based on the extra footage we've seen in today's release date trailer, it looks like our assumptions were correct.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I do like a combat system that resembles an overflowing dressmaker's draw, full of bouncing rubber thimbles and coils of bunting. While it's not quite as chaotic and entangled as say, Disgaea, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is one of those games. I'd call it "baroque", but that would be out of synch with developer Sandfall Interactive's stated influences: the new RPG takes place in a molten and fragmented fantasy world based on the Belle Époque or "beautiful era" of late 19th century France. Your job as player is to stop a sorcerous Paintress from painting everybody over a certain age out of existence. We'll circle back to the plot, though. First, the excessively ornate battlin'.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stormgate is a confusing proposition. It's an RTS directed by former Blizzard developers that is almost, but not quite, entirely unlike StarCraft. It's a free-to-play game, but has a business model that makes you feel like you're getting a rougher deal than if you just dropped thirty notes for it outright. It's available now in Early Access, but has already been available in a kind of gravity-defying Super Early Access for several weeks (which you had to pay to get into).


All of which has made me feel very tired, and yearn for the days when you went into a shop and bought a game in a box for a set amount of money, and the whole game was in the box and you went home and put it on your PC and played it until your mum said "Richard!" (only my mum calls me Richard) "get off that computer and go outside and get some exercise! Do you want to be dead at 35?" Well, I'm 36 now mum. Nearly 37. So who's laughing through their heart palpitations now?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Update:  This evening, we received the following "communication from the Spiders studio":

Paris, 28th August 2024 – The Union of Video Game Workers (Syndicat des
Travailleurs (ses) du Jeu Vidéo) has publicly relayed allegations concerning the
working environment at Spiders. The false and even defamatory accusations made by
the STJV in no way reflect the reality of the day-to-day working life of the company's
employees and are an attack on the reputation of the studio, whose teams are fully
mobilized to produce quality games and enthusiastically ensure the Early Access
release of GreedFall 2.

Spiders' management is committed to open and constructive social dialogue. After
unsuccessful attempts over the last few days to meet with a delegation of employees,
they have proposed a meeting again by the end of the week.

Spiders' employees are the heart of the studio, and we are determined to maintain an
inclusive and stimulating working environment in which every talent can flourish and of
which we can all be proud.

The email was signed by Consulting Director Caroline Richard and Associate Director Laurence Tovi.

While it would be a monumentally silly heel turn to go back on their promise of only charging Space Marine 2 players extra for cosmetics a mere week and change before the shooter’s September 9 release date,  the new year one roadmap does at least look piously forthright.
Chatting to James at Gamescom recently (possibly from his cathedral ship made out of graphics cards), Saber boss Tim Willits dragged out an armoured horse and proceeded to flog it mercilessly, saying that players don’t want to be sold the equivalent of Oblivion's infamous deadbeat daddy of DLCs. As several of you identified, this seemed like an odd comparison when Spice Maureen 2 specifically plans to charge for comparable cosmetics, although I imagine Willits was referencing the “packs” that his space game’s baubles come in. “Our fans never thought we ripped them off in World War Z,” he said, comparing Space Marine 2’s optional spendables to that game.
Whether you see the cosmetic's pricing as egregious or not, yesterday’s roadmap does look to make good on Saber’s promise to keep wearables and playables separate. Here’s it:

After months of trailers, teases, and hands-off looks at it, the upcoming title had its big blowout, complete with a playable Gamescom demo and a round of previews I was invited to.

It’s a cameo that shines above all the other cameos in a movie made up almost entirely of cameos. As the movie ends, it’s a shame that we have to say goodbye to Tatum’s portrayal just as we finally got it. Well,…

I have ample nostalgia for the old marsupial myself, with his second Naughty Dog-developed outing being a particular obsession, but come now, we're all about deckbuilders, soulsliking and battle royale nowadays, right?
Still, I'll admit to a twinge of disappointment after reading that a Crash Bandicoot 5 was once in development at Crash 4: It's About Time developers Toys For Bob, and might have featured an interdimensional team-up with one of Crash's old rivals. No, not Mario.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When we talk about a game having a sense of place, it’s often about how adroitly it covers up the necessary falsehoods of a world contrived to accommodate the player character. It’s the good kind of lie. One with purpose, like Lucas smearing vaseline over the camera lens to cover up the landspeeder’s wheels. Star Wars Outlaws, then, is a strange case. Because while its planets and cities do feel ersatz as living places, they’re kind of incredible as film sets. That’s your job here. This is where the game is. You don’t play it so much as you perform your role in a series of loving, enthusiastic callbacks. That’s a star war. This is a star war. Oh, hey, I know that! That’s one of my favourite star warses.

When he is eaten by a passing disco lizard or ravenous skull-faced vulture, it is because he is basically a delicious Squirmle existing in a horrifying cryptozoological ecosystem. He is, however, never stepped upon by a mech with a missile launcher. He is never given a shotgun and tasked with shooting the other animals. Yet that basically seems to be the elevator pitch for Uruc, a sci-fi metroidvania set in a distant future where strange life battles mechanical monstrosities.

Supermassive Games and Behaviour Interactive must have gotten the memo too. They've just released a demo for their next horror game The Casting Of Frank Stone, in which you are a policeman, Sam Green, who is investigating the disappearance of a child. The search leads you to Cedar Hills Steel Mill, "where chilling secrets await, revealing a far more sinister truth than anyone could have anticipated". I am anticipating: QTEs during escape sequences, branching choices that get people killed, and General Mature Content appropriate to the coming of Halloween.

With just four months left of 2024, a software supplier hasn't even been chosen yet. With the current system falling over, previously blocked domains and IP addresses are being unblocked to make room for new ones, something that the law has no provision for. Meanwhile, smart TV manufacturers will soon be asked to ban a VPN app from their sets.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Almost a decade after his acrimonious departure from Konami, the shadow of Hideo Kojima still looms over Metal Gear Solid. He's there, barely camouflaged, in the undergrowth of Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater - a remake of the fifth Metal Gear game, originally released in 2004, which tells the tale of a lone US special operator hunting superweapons and old mentors in the jungles of the southern Soviet Union. 


I say "remake" but this feels more like a re-release, in spirit. True, it now runs on Unreal Engine, with the option of a manual, third-person perspective and cover-shooter controls in addition to the old top-down viewpoints. Yes, it boasts new flourishes, such as wounds now leaving scars, and clothes picking up stray leaves. Yes, there's a new interface with floating in-world menus, which makes shuffling between the layers a bit less awkward. It's the product of much labour, with development split between Konami and external support partner Virtuos. But where Konami's other big restoration project, Bloober's Silent Hill 2 remake, is a creative dialogue with the original game, Delta seems consumed by faithfulness to Kojima's original design.

I, for one, feel like I've been grossly ill-informed. Kate, Hilary - I've been quoting you for years at parties and it seems like all this time, people have been silently judging me for my ignorance of the role giant clockwork soldiers played in the fall of the Bastille.

It’s also not a terribly accurate one. From what I saw of the game, Dinolords is more about the lords than the dinos, having as much in common with Diablo-style ARPGs as it does with classic strategy. And that’s a distinction which might just elevate it out of novelty status.

Trailered this week at Gamescom 2024, it's the fifth installment in the hitherto mobile-focussed Nikki series and it's seemingly going down a storm, with over 12 million pre-registrations so far (albeit, many of them motivated by the prospect of collectively unlocked in-game bonuses). It's also a free-to-play game, and I have the usual unanswered questions about currencies and gacha, but I'm willing to give it the benefit of the doubt for the minute, because I have not spent nearly enough of my life considering the tactical applications of ballgowns. Here's that trailer.

That discussion was back on my mind as I sat down to play Reignbreaker, a new action-roguelike from Studio Fizbin, at Gamescom 2024 – slightly wary of its self-described medievalpunk styling. However! Turns out you’re trying to kill the queen. Yep, that’s, uh, that’s pretty punk.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of my formative video game moments is the final mission of Psygnosis cyberpunk flight sim G-Police. (It came out in 1997, and as such, I think the statute of limitations on spoilers has passed, but if you still intend to play, stop reading now.) The mission completes the long arc of foreshadowing begun by the intro's mention that capital-class spacecraft have been outlawed, following a ruinous war. It turns out that one particular evil corpo has been sneakily building one of these megaships - not only that, but you get to fly inside it, cannons ablazing. It was while doing so that teenage me realised the true exceptionality of the Video Game Artform. You can't fly inside capital ships in, like, symbolist poems or baroque symphonies, can you? You can't fly in poems or symphonies at all, unless you do so metaphorically - "metaphor" being a kind of poor man's graphics card.
The technology of flight simming has advanced mightily since G-Police's day. For instance: in Everspace 2's just-announced Titans DLC, you get to fly inside not just regular old spaceships, but massive space kaiju with procedurally generated digestive systems. Here's the trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Assassin's Creed: Valhalla, Odyssey, and Origins all have one thing in common: they've got a Discovery mode, which replaces murdering with learning. You can, quite literally, go on tours curated by historians around each of the game's respective maps. Instead of diving off a Sphinx and plunging your hidden blade into someone's spinal column, you can look up at the Sphinx and read a paragraph on its significance. Maybe view an actual, real life bit of ancient Egypt from an actual real life museum collection in-game. Perhaps embody an Anglo-Saxon lad in Valhalla, instead, and like, cook up some nettle soup having just got a fresh "Friar Tuck" at the local hair choppers (no guarantees on this last bit).
This is all to say that Black Myth: Wukong deserves such a mode, too. There were so many times throughout my review time where I stopped and stared and wondered as to something's meaning. Not only in the architecture, but in the characters, too. So here I am with a proposition: how about instead of thwacking things with my staff, I can use it as a walking stick and point it at things I want to learn about.

The square brackets are part of the title, yes, and they're also calling it "punk rock" - a combination of factors that fills me with a rage so obliterating, I can barely perceive the announcement trailer, below. It's a machinegun montage of comicbook panels and sizzling melee arcs and quips like "there's a lot of wankers between you and the sweet taste of freedom". I didn't even like The Callisto Protocol that much but still, what have they done to you, boy? Where did all the horror game go?

If a park sim based on Tim Burton’s 1996 B-Movie homage Mars Attacks wasn’t on my bingo card, it’s because I’ve recently binned it and replaced it with a bobble head that simply nods in amused acceptance at whatever videogames decide to do next. And conceptually, Jurassic World Evolution with captive humans instead of dinos isn’t not a potential winner, is it? Still, I was mildly bemused to learn that Mars Attracts, coming sometime next year, is the film’s first licensed game. But then I realised that I’d never thought to check before, which might go some way to explaining the lack of them. Do you reckon they did the pun then worked backwards from there? Respectable, honestly.

I mean, it's only a real-time tactical stealth game set in a cursed 18th century Jesuit monastery, developed by the people behind gorgeously gross metroidvania Blasphemous. It's only got isometric art inspired by Goya and a sanity/trauma system redolent of Darkest Dungeon. Sounds like an automatic RPS write-up to me.

Well, some of the minds behind Unravel are working on new game called Hela. This time it's less about yarn and more about being a small mouse who does parkour. Still, it does retain some of the bodily gymnastics of its predecessor. Namely the use of tongues as bungee ropes.

Whether plundering the earth in SteamWorld Dig 2 or mucking about with magic in SteamWorld Quest, these are solid and approachable adventures that enthusiastically embrace whatever theme the developers have decided upon. Cowboys? Sure. Wizards? Why not. It barely matters, as long as it results in some good puns. As a studio, Thunderful have a reputation for hopping from one style of game to the next, boiling entire genres down to their essence, and reconstituting them with competence and style to exist within a now-familiar steampunk world of colourful pals and Saturday morning cartoon jokes. The studio is a perpetual notion machine. Yes, with SteamWorld Heist 2, they're revisiting the sci-fi bullet-bouncing of their 2016 tactics game SteamWorld Heist, but they're also introducing significant changes to create a compulsive XCOM-like full of sea-faring submariners that may be their best work yet, even against a back catalogue of blinders.

And, if its - sadly hands-off - Gamescom showcase is any indication, it might just double down on Starfield’s own strengths as well.

Atomfall’s alternative history makes Britain’s worst nuclear disaster even more disastrous, plunging the realm into full-on post-apocalyptica and leaving your good amnesiac self to dodge death with nothing but a cricket bat and whatever you can scrounge out of sheds.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In June, Webtoon Entertainment celebrated going public by sounding the closing bell at the Nasdaq exchange. Thus far, early investors haven't been rewarded, but the company itself sees a bright future ahead. By targeting roughly 170 pirate site domains though a DMCA subpoena, it hopes to unmask their rogue operators and clear the path for future growth.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've never really understood the charm of ultrawide monitors. I dare boldly to maintain that there is such a thing as Too Wide, a point beyond which the extra visual estate becomes a waste of electricity, unless you watch the screen in pairs. I can only assume people who use ultrawide monitors live in constant terror of flanking manoeuvres and demand the maximum amount of peripheral vision. Mind you, I tend to play games with my nose about 10 centimetres from the screen. Forget being flanked - it's the prospect of snipers up ahead I'm worried about.
If you're among the people who fret excessively about flankers, I've got great news from Uncle BioWare. Forthcoming RPG Dragon Age: The Veilguard will support 21:9 ultrawide monitors. The ultrawide functionality extends to cinematics - you can disable "cinematic aspect ratios" to switch off the black bars that otherwise hem in the view. It's one of several PC-specific flourishes they've just blogged about. Have a look.

In this case, it's the demo for Cupiclaw, which is possibly the first ever "roguelike deckbuilding claw machine game". You know how Balatro made you feel about Joker cards? Well, this game wants to make you feel the same about claw machines. It's a terrible turn of events, frankly. I'm sorry for inflicting yet another potential bingeplay upon you. Here's a trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Our James recently stormed off to Cologne after having one too many kills stolen by Edwin in Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2. “I’m never even going to look at another videogame again!”, he declared. Unfortunately for James, he accidentally walked straight into Gamescom. “I’m starting to think that there are a lot of video games” he informed us yesterday. Horrifying if true. Still, it does sound like he’s managing to have some fun there, mainly by hitting up Saber Interactive COO and former id Software co-owner Tim Willits for some top tips on how to avenge Edwin’s thieving ways.
Tips about kill-stealing aside, James found time to ask Willits about Space Marine 2's microtransactions, and whether there was any nervousness returning to a cult hit series… especially one a lot of people had almost given up on ever seeing again. “Even the “push forward” combat of the original was part of [id’s] inspiration when we created Doom 2016,” answered Willits. “So for me personally, it’s this huge circle. It’s always intimidating working on a franchise that people love.” But, with the right team, technology, and vision he says, “it just comes together.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Now, I never played quite as much as our Brendy did of the original Splitgate. But I had a fun time with its mixture of Halo-esque trigger pulling and portalling around! So I was intrigued to give the alpha version of Splitgate 2 a go and see if it had a little more substance to it than its initial reveal, which gave off a, "it's Splitgate but with more money" feel. 
Well, I think it's… a bit serious? It certainly has more polish and some extra additions, yet I didn't come away from it thrilled by its more competitive, class-based FPS leanings. I think it just needs a bit more time, perhaps, for a portal to open and some silly rocket launchers and baseball bats and zombies to come tumbling out of it.

If you have have experience of the London rental market, you are probably reading this and thinking: “He’s got a front door? Such extravagance. I live in a folded umbrella.” Touché, my friend. I guess it’s just as well we have spaciously proportioned first-person puzzle adventures to console us in our time of compound elbow bruises, rising damp and preposterous financial debt. On which note, Looking For Fael seems fun.

That's partly because Embark Studios' other in-development game, The Finals, progressed faster than planned and stole its momentum. It's also because it was re-tooled at some point as a PvPvE extraction shooter.

Now it's back again, aiming for release next year, and it's been re-tooled a little more: it's no longer free-to-play.

So much so, in fact, that I’d assumed the trailer I watched during an online preview event last week was for a new entry in the horror cinematic-platformer series, right up until the name Reanimal appeared on the screen - shortly followed by a snippet of voiced dialogue.
It’s not just the horror setting, but the Grimm’s fairytale threat, the distorted adults-made-monsters through the trauma-tinged lens of a child’s imagination. A long-limbed man riding a bicycle in a threadbare suit chases children down an alley. A gangly, bowler-hatted pursuer scuttles down a long table like a spider. It's familiar enough territory, at least at first glance. But when Tarsier have a body of work subconsciously scarred by phantasms this vivid, recurring nightmares are just as potent.

Devastating, especially since it's only ever happened to me once. Anyway, this is a long but no less meaningful segue to a game from the Far: Changing Tides and Lone Sails devs Okomotive that's just been announced at this year's Geoffcom show. It's called Herdling and it's nothing to do with sailing across a decaying universe, but very much to do with alpine expeditions and friendly beasts. Very unexpected.

There are Nazis to fight in Indiana Jones And The Great Circle - a globe-trotting, tomb-robbing adventure featuring a Lost Ark-era Harrison Ford - but as you'd expect from a Lucasfilm adaptation, there's rather less of the bloodshed.

In development at Molyneux's 2012-founded studio 22cans, it looks like a mix of Populous and Black & White with knocked-together, toylike visuals, and a loose tower-defence format whereby monsters attack your villages at night. Here's the first trailer.

Out in 2025, Directive 8020 is the story of the good ship Cassiopeia, a human colony vessel that is infiltrated by Something Icky. The Something Icky is capable of mimicking humans. So that'd be a bit like Alien and a bit like The Thing, then. Sorry, human colonists!
Directive 8020 was teased at the end of the last Dark Pictures instalment, 2022's The Devil in Me. A trailer also leaked back in November 2022. Now, we have an official announcement video.

"To show appreciation for the community who patiently waited for the DLC, Techland will be offering Dying Light: The Beast at no extra cost to all owners of the Dying Light 2 Stay Human Ultimate Edition, delivering a full standalone adventure instead of just a DLC." That's nice! 
This seems like an odd one. I’m only tangentially familiar with the Dying Light games, but I was under the impression that the model here was releasing a single game, then updating and expanding it for years. Whether standalone adventure Dying Light: The Beast represents an attempt to course correct after Dying Light 2’s mixed reception, then, I’m not entirely sure. But if nothing else, it does share something in common with all the other adverts at Gamescom tonight: it is a game that exists, and will presumably be playable at some point.

But hand-drawn RPG Heroes Of The Seven Islands feels more authentic than all that. It’s bedroom antifolk by way of chill dungeon synth, by way of an antelope sorcerer named Jean-Pierre.

Reviewer Edders went so far as to find the world more engaging than that of Elden Ring - proper defying-the-gods level rhetoric. Players seem to agree. The game launched last night, and has already accrued a concurrent player peak of 1.44 million - Steam's fourth highest ever, exceeded only by Counter-Strike, Palworld and PUBG. By that metric, it's the platform's most popular strictly single player game of all the time.
All that goodwill has been spoiled, however, by a Steam code handout message to streamers and other "content creators" before launch which includes some reactionary, non-binding requests - no mention of "trigger words" like "Covid-19", no talk of "politics" or "feminist propaganda", and no mention of "China's game industry policies, opinions, news, etc".

Magically, it’s also a tactics game for people who love them like nothing else. It’s permissive and demanding; playful and tense. Its globe-spanning plot covers conspiracies, PMCs, and brutal theocratic dictatorships. It also features a traffic-summoning warlock named Steve wearing a hi-vis robe. It’s finding that one absolutely, perfectly ridiculous XCOM turn, every turn…and at the same time knowing it’s absolutely, perfectly fine if you don’t. In short: it’s one of the most enjoyable tactics games I’ve ever played, and the only tactics game with a pyromancer so rubbish he relies on making his enemies pass out from heatstroke.

They've also shared a little about why it's taken so long to arrive - the (generally decent) action-RPG hit PS5 over a year ago, back when I was still some filthy console-playing freelancer.
According to director Hiroshi Takai, it was "impossible" to create the PC and PS5 versions at the same time, even if Square Enix hadn't been restrained by a timed exclusivity clause. He also thinks that the Final Fantasy series faces no "existential risk" right now, despite lower-than-hoped returns from both Final Fantasy 16 and, going by Square Enix's latest financial reports, the more recent and currently PS5-only Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Silent Hill has a messy, up-is-down relationship with time and history, so let's go about this hands-on with the Silent Hill 2 Remake in a messy, up-is-down way. Developed well over two decades ago, the original Silent Hill 2 is the magnum opus of Polish horror stalwarts Bloober Team. Running on then-innovative "Unreal Engine 5" technology created by Jazz Jackrabbit publishers Epic MegaGames, it's a wonderful abyss of a game that remains perfectly playable today, given a certain amount of tolerance for the quirks of the era.
It begins with your character, James Sunderland, descending from the road towards the eponymous Midwestern nowhere-town. Like many games of the period, Silent Hill 2 uses a third-person, over-the-shoulder manual camera, which allows you to glance fearfully up at the monstrous pine trees that fringe the path - each rising from a bulging tide of fog that menaces with the suggestion of approaching figures. There is moisture everywhere, gushing from drain pipes and dribbling down concrete barriers. As you amble into the murk, deathly chords and groaning, unmechanical motifs reverberate from somewhere deep underground.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve likely mentioned hitting Lovecraft fatigue so often that it’s now evolved into a second phase of Lovecraft-fatigue fatigue. This is not the same as Lovecraft refreshment, no matter how much I might want to return to the days before old one plushies and Cthulhu children’s books terrorised the internet en masse. There’s not quite enough information about “story generator” sim Marry a Deep One: Innsmouth Simulator for me to confidently say it’ll cut through my exhaustion with all things tentacular and horrifically be-gilled. But it is beguiling, isn’t it? There’s all sorts of little widgets and details shown off that remind me of everything from Sid Meier’s Pirates to classic adventure games, and maybe even a little Rimworld? It’s a heady soup, although one I’d recommend against quaffing, given where the water comes from.

Twitchy slashfest Dead Cells received its final major update, introducing new enemies, fresh weapons, and a few mutations. Unfortunately, all this new stuff is very cursed. In other words, it all toys with the game's "curse" status effect, a hex that causes you to be killed if you take even a single hit. You'll probably die a few times as a result of this update, which in some ways is a fitting finalé for this fast-paced jar smasher of a game. You can see the new features in the trailer below.

The 2022 version of Modern Warfare 2 lacked the original’s multiplayer, and H2M was so highly-anticipated that Steam sales of the 2016 FPS balooned in the lead-up to the mod’s planned release date. It didn't hurt that Activision had it on sale, of course, but the timing lined up so well that some fans speculated the discount was a deliberate bait-and-switch on the publisher’s part to profit from excitement over a mod they were already planning to shut down.

Video games (PC games, specifically) are the only thing that can preoccupy the Maw, the only thing newsworthy enough to distract it from the tempting clifftop maisonettes of Torquay.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Bloober and Konami announced that they were remaking Silent Hill 2 as part of a comprehensive series reboot, it made immediate if slightly deflating sense to me. Silent Hill 2 is the more feted of the Hills - if I were a calculating franchise custodian tasked with 'bringing back' one of the acclaimed original trilogy, that's probably the instalment I and my spreadsheets would fix upon. I mean, it's the game with Pyramid Head in it - the nearest thing Silent Hill has to a mascot, and it's not like there's an issue of cutting out plot material: each game in the Silent Hill series is, on some level, a distinct story with a distinct protagonist.
Still, the decision to 'skip' the first game in the series, whose world, narrative themes, music and art direction set the parameters for all the rest, made my brain itch a bit, and when I ran into Bloober's creative director Mateusz Lenart and lead producer Maciej Głomb at a Konami event, I had to ask about it.

Coinciding almost perfectly with the leak's 15-year anniversary, a complaint filed with Google now claims that the report violates copyright law and must be permanently deindexed from search results.

Still, I'd quite like it to come good, if only so I can justify op-eds about Lewis Carroll, and I'm somewhat encouraged by what I've heard of the game's forthcoming Realms Rebuilt update.

And either way, it's a spectacular journey that works for mostly everyone: those after challenging fights against Chinese mythological creatures, and those after the same thing, but with a little less challenge than your typical Soulslikes. What separates Black Myth from the crowd, though, is its slick presentation and a sense of generosity. You're to witness the most lavish, cinematic worlds and its creatures. And you're to enjoy battering everything with your staff as a highly athletic monkey with copious spells at his furry follicles and fingertips. It's been a while since I've played anything quite as impressive as this.
