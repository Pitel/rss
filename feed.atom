        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, the second chapter of the planned Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy of games, received a brief but welcomed progress report from producer Yoshinori Kitase. Though we haven’t heard a peep about the game since its reveal last June, we could be getting a release date soon. 
In a tweet, Kitase answered the question of how Rebirth is progressing by simply stating, “Development is progressing smoothly and according to plan. We are currently  working on nailing down a release date for the game.”

June 2, 2023
While not much, the update is an exciting one if things are going as well as Kitase claims. As for when we could hear about a launch date, Summer Game Fest is around the corner, and Square Enix is one of the confirmed partners for the event, so there's a small chance Rebirth will make an appearance. 
Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is currently slated to release this winter for PlayStation 5 and picks up after the events of Final Fantasy VII Remake and its Intermission story expansion. Though it follows Cloud and Co.’s journey beyond Midgar, the cinematic reveal trailer makes it tough to know what to expect given the Remake's events (other than Cloud and Sephiroth taking a lot of strolls together), so hopefully we'll be getting another glimpse of the project sooner than later. 
For more, be sure to read our reviews of Final Fantasy VII Remake and the Intermission expansion in the Intergrade version. Square Enix is also gearing up to launch Final Fantasy XVI, which graces Game Informer's cover this month.

Join us today Friday on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central as we kick of the adventure, which will continue each week until we roll credits. We'll also have every episode available the next day on our Game Informer Shows YouTube Channel (or you can watch the videos in the above playlist). 
Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts was released for the Xbox 360 on November 11, 2008. The third (and, so far, final) entry in Rare's beloved platforming series centers on vehicle creation, where players collect and slap together hundreds of parts to assemble their own wacky contraptions to explore. The bevy of possible combinations and emphasis on player choice and creativity was largely unprecedented at the time, paving the way for future games such as the upcoming The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. However, this direction would divide fans due to how much it strays from the traditional Banjo formula. So where will I land on it? Let's find out.
Join me, Marcus Stewart, alongside Kyle Hilliard as we explore one of the Xbox 360's biggest hidden gems to see whether it holds up or falls apart like a poorly constructed doohickey.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Retrofashionistio
While nobody would deny that the 18-strong roster of Street Fighter 6 is pretty damn slick-looking, everyone loves a bit of variety in the wardrobe — As such Capcom has released a new trailer showing shown off each of the World Warrior's alternate costumes.
As you can see, returning characters receive their classic skins, from Ryu & Ken's legendary karate Gis to Chun-Li extravagant... erm... Interpol Uniform. Cammy is sure to turn heads in her borderline obscene battle suit, while Juri gets her biker gear back, albeit missing the black undershirt. Damn, Capcom were feeling particularly thirsty with this release.
For the newcomers, Marisa has an incredible cream suit reminiscent of Like a Dragon's Kazuma Kiryu, while Manon simply stuns in an haute couture deal fresh from the streets of Paris. "Drip", or something. Of all the characters, Dee Jay Maximum perhaps pulls the biggest switcheroo, as his classic Super Street Fighter II gear makes him look like an entirely different character! All in, everyone looks pretty rad.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNKO77QDCN4
How to unlock the Street Fighter 6 alt costumes
So, how do you bag these skins? Well, they can be purchased from the in-game store for 50 Fighter Coins each to 2500 Drive Tickets (this includes all color variants). They can be unlocked by playing through World Tour and maxing out your personal bond with the respective characters. Once the bond hits 100, then the character's outfit (complete with the color variants) unlocks for use in Arcade, Vs., and other one-on-one modes.
No doubt, as Capcom is wont to do, the cast will receive a huge array of additional DLC costumes as SF6 passes through its lifespan, to be purchased via Fighter Coins and/or Drive Tickets.
Street Fighter 6 is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

It's been a while since we last heard from the Final Fantasy VII remake team. After revealing the name and direction of the second part of the remake trilogy, the team behind Final Fantasy VII Rebirth posted a development update today.
Producer Yoshinori Kitase provided the update on Twitter. The post asks how development is progressing on Final Fantasy VII Rebirth.
"Development is progressing smoothly and according to plan," Kitase said. "We are currently working on nailing down a release date for the game."
https://twitter.com/finalfantasyvii/status/1664617912060231680/
That's the extent of it, so there's no indication whether the original winter window is moving or not. Final Fantasy XVI is just around the corner anyways, so I personally wouldn't be surprised if Square Enix doesn't start talking about Rebirth more until XVI is out.
You can (not) redo
Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is the follow-up to Final Fantasy VII Remake, which both is and isn't an actual remake of Final Fantasy VII. While it's retelling a big part of the early story of FFVII, Remake eventually strikes out and forges its own path. Its story looks set to diverge with Rebirth.
We did just get a Crisis Core remaster to help newcomers catch up with the story of Zack Fair. And Ever Crisis, a mobile game, is set to somehow encapsulate the VII timeline. It'll be interesting to see how this new expansion of the Final Fantasy VII multi-verse comes together over the next few years.
Sounds like Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is at least progressing along well, though. Meanwhile, if you can't wait for that, a new Final Fantasy debuts in June.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For the imperium!
Fun fact: origins of the term ‘grimdark’ can be directly traced back to the original Warhammer 40k tabletop game. Suffice it to say, the cynical and nihilistic world of Warhammer 40k sucks. Despite the highly advanced and amazing intergalactic society that mankind has built, to live in this universe is to live in a bleak place where humanity exists in a state of total war as it fights hopelessly to delay its inevitable demise at the hands of all manner of eldritch space gods and aliens. Nobody is ‘good’ in this universe, and nobody is going to make it out okay, which makes Warhammer 40k and the boomer shooter genre feel like a match made in hell. Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun may not be the best entry in this genre, but it gets enough right that we’d recommend it to anyone looking for a solid retro FPS.
Boltgun is set after the events of Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine. You're a marine sent by the imperium to pacify a group of tech priests who are experimenting with a dangerous power source on a distant planet. You’re initially sent with a squad, but your drop pod rather conveniently crashes and burns on the planet’s surface, violently killing everyone except you. Left with no other choice and armed with nothing more than a sick chainsaw sword, you press on into the den of heretics to carry out the mission in the name of the glorious Emperor.

But it's set very thoroughly in Taiwan towards the end of World War II, and though the focus is a young girl's relationship with her family and friends, that context is critical to why I've enjoyed it so much.
Taxonomy aside, then, the important thing is that it's enjoyable. It hasn't hit the emotional highs of the kind of interactive fiction I favour, but for a story with such heavy themes, it provides a relaxing drip feed of mystery reveals and plot thickenings in between low-pressure minigames. It's a good time, without undermining its obvious respect for the people who had to live through this.

In the latest debacle surrounding publisher Dispatch Games, digital versions of Radirgy Swag have been delisted from the North American, Australian, and European Switch eShops.
The game, which was published by Dispatch Games in the West, was removed back on April 7th, 2023 for Europe and Australia, and on April 11th, 2023 for North America. As for the reasoning behind the removal, it's probably safe to assume at this stage that Dispatch Games has lost its license to publish the game digitally, after effectively ceasing operations back in August 2022. Radirgy Swag is still available in Japan, having been published by developer RS34.

With Final Fantasy, that’s doubly the case because for me, and I imagine for so many others, the music of this series is one of its best parts. Be it lo-fi channels, new arrangements, compilations, piano versions, or something else, Final Fantasy music makes its way into many of my playlists. 
That’s why I was so excited to chat with composer Masayoshi Soken about his score for Final Fantasy XVI. You might recognize his name as he’s also the composer of Final Fantasy XIV. Still, if you don’t, there’s a chance it’s a name you come to remember following the release of FFXVI, because after more than three hours of hands-on time with the game in Square Enix’s Tokyo, Japan, …]]></summary>

Street Fighter 6 has launched with 18 World Warriors, all of which are, at least from first impressions, fully viable characters.

After playing Catch & Cook’s recently released demo, I’m happy to report that it’s the ideal fishing sim for people who find Dredge’s spooky undercurrents, erm, too spooky. Just a very chill, very good time.

While a little on the safe side for a sequel, we had a good time with old-school beat 'em up River City Girls 2 when it was released last year, although we did notice some technical issues along the way. Fortunately, several of these have been tackled by developer WayForward in the game's latest update, which is available to download today.
It looks like ironing out small tweaks has been the main thrust of the update, but there have also been some tweaks made to the game's performance as well as the implementation of repeated New Game + playthroughs.

It's a strange thing to see Nintendo swing so wildly from one extreme to another, at least in such a short timeframe.
Coming hot on the heels of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, the company has gone and quietly — very quietly — announced Everybody 1-2-Switch!, the follow-up to 2017's launch title 1-2-Switch. It is largely agreed amongst critics and fans alike that the original should have been a pack-in title to showcase the features of the then-new Joy-Con and the local multiplayer focus of the console rather than a full-price purchase. But here we are.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Will it be Resident Evil 5?
The Resident Evil franchise has been on top of the world lately, especially with the release of the Resident Evil 4 remake. Now, not wanting to stop this juggernaut, Capcom is asking you which other game in the iconic survival horror series you'd like to see get remade, if any.
The recent survey poses a few questions about how well people know what's happening in the world of Resident Evil. For example, people are asked whether they follow any of the official social media channels, as well as how familiar they are with the entries, be they games or movie adaptations. One of the final questions then gives you the chance to suggest which installment you'd like to see a remake of.

With Capcom flying high in terms of sales, no doubt the studio is interested in where to take things from here. It should be pointed out that the survey results won't necessarily mean there'll be another RE remake in the pipeline. However, there have already been rumors that the series' 2009 release, Resident Evil 5 could be getting reimagined, but there's no solid evidence for that yet.
Given that the remake of Resident Evil 4 has sold millions of copies, it's not surprising that Capcom wants to keep bringing back older entries. At this point, however, anything past the fourth entry doesn't quite fit the "classic" status of the earlier installments. RE5 is certainly a mainline series entry but arguably may not necessarily warrant a full remake.
Maybe the results of this survey will lead Capcom into deciding an official remake of it is the way forward.

He’d come to the tech expo with Condor, a studio he’d co-founded only a few months prior, to show off Justice League: Task Force. A humble fighting game in the vein of Street Fighter, it was given a small demo booth and placed next to another game that featured a cast of superheroes, a strikingly similar visual style and, much to Brevik’s surprise, the very same name.


Without their knowing, Condor were one of two studios hired to develop the DC Comics tie-in: their Sega Mega Drive/Genesis version set to release alongside a SNES title made by another recently formed team, Silicon & Synapse. “We'd never talked to them,” Brevik says. “We'd never interacted with them. We didn't know there was even another version, and then we show up at the booth and they're side by side, and we're like, this is really weird.” They didn't know it yet, but these Justice League sort-of clones were the first paving stones on the road to the Diablo series.

More specifically, Nintendo is releasing the Pastel Pink Joy-Con, Pastel Yellow Joy-Con, Pastel Purple Joy-Con, and Pastel Green Joy-Con on June 30, which is the same day Nintendo's newly announced sequel to 2017's 1-2-Switch hits the console.  The Joy-Con will be sold in standard pairs. The Pastel Pink and Pastel Yellow Joy-Con are packaged together and the Pastel Purple and Pastle Green Joy-Con are packaged together. 
Each set of Joy-Con will include two black Joy-Con wrist straps as well. The Joy-Con are currently showing as sold out on Nintendo's online store. If they were available, you could pre-purchase them now so that you receive them quickly when they start shipping on June 30. Nonetheless, the store makes it clear these Pastel Joy-Con will cost $79.99 for a set, which is in line with other previously released sets of Joy-Con.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We're gonna need a bigger hub
Capcom's Street Fighter 6 might have only just launched this morning, but it is already breaking Steam records, instantly setting the bar for the most consecutive players in a premium fighting game on the PC platform.
As noted by Steamdb, Street Fighter 6, within the early hours of the morning, hit a high of 65,873 concurrent players. While this doesn't beat out the early-day success of free-to-play fighter MultiVersus, it does beat all full-price fighting games releases to date, toppling the previous king, Warner Bros.' bloodlust scrapper Mortal Kombat 11, by just over 30,000 players.
Street Fighter 6, which officially launches today after a year of build-up, has received high accolades across the board, becoming one of the highest-rated fighting games of all time on review aggregate sites such as Metacritic. Capcom has achieved this level of praise by producing a feature-packed, great-looking, and rock-solid sequel, which has been delivered to PlayStation, PC, and Xbox players, and looks set to lead the charge into a bold new era of fighting titles currently set to ignite the scene.
Street Fighter 6 is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms. You can check out our review right here, as well as our opinion on which World Warriors should be heading to the roster in the future.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo has revealed a sequel to 2017's Switch launch title 1-2-Switch, and it's out this month. 
Titled Everybody 1-2-Switch!, this sequel features team-based games that can be played using Switch console Joy-Con and mobile devices. Nintendo's description of the game says players can split into teams "and see which group can win a certain number of games first," while also noting that many of the games have several variations that change the rules or add extra challenge. 
Everybody 1-2-Switch hits Switch on June 30. Both the physical and digital edition will cost $29.99. 
While this is a surprise official announcement from Nintendo, this isn't the first time we've heard of Everybody 1-2-Switch. Former Game Informer and Fanbyte editor Imran Khan wrote a report while at Fanbyte about this sequel. In that report, Khan spoke to several sources who said the game was complete but unannounced because of how badly it was testing. Nintendo didn't know what to do with the game, with many fearing releasing it in its current state could harm the company's reputation for releasing great games. 
It's unclear what's changed between that report and now – perhaps nothing has changed and Nintendo is using the excitement around The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom to quietly release Everybody 1-2-Switch. Only time will tell, but fortunately, we don't have to wait long because Everybody 1-2-Switch hits Switch on June 30. 
In the meantime, read Game Informer's review of 1-2-Switch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sequel? Online Shooter? Probably one or both
Ubisoft has released a new trailer teasing its upcoming summer presentation, Ubisoft Forward — The live stream event, which will take place on June 12, will feature updates on an array of the publisher's titles, as well as the reveal of an all-new mystery game.
The trailer, which you can check out below, features clips from some of the studio's incoming wares, including Assassin's Creed Mirage, Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, and The Crew: Motorfest. A group of models, impossibly too trendy to be watching a publisher live stream then enquire as to a mystery image, delivering a delightfully wooden "Wait. What's that Game?" I dunno, probably another crossover shooter for mobile platforms. Why not? Also, it helps if your TV is actually turned on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAsWtB4f5Ls&t
If you want to check out the action for yourself, then Ubisoft Forward kicks off June 12 at 10:00 PT / 13:00 ET / 18:00 BST and can be watched live on Ubisoft's YouTube, Twitch, and social media channels. Of course, Team Destructoid will be sat around for the affair, likely in an apartment far less perfect than the one featured in this video), and will bring you all of the headlines as they occur.
Assassin's Creed Mirage launches on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox October 12. Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora launches later this year on PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X. Finally, The Crew: Motorfest also launches later this year on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

Happy Pride, everyone! We're updating and republishing this list of some of Switch's best and most inclusive games in celebration of Pride month. Enjoy!

The games industry has not always been good at portraying LGBTQ+ relationships and identities, but thanks to the efforts of small studios, indie developers, and LGBTQ+ creators, that's beginning to change. Not only do we have enough games with strong LGBTQ+ themes on the Nintendo Switch that we can actually make a list, but all of these games are exceptionally good. We're spoiled for choice!

Since its release three weeks ago, Nintendo has been pretty ruthless with patching The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. And with each patch, multiple different item duplication glitches have been fixed. However, that hasn't deterred fans, as people keep finding new ways to easily duplicate items in unintended ways.
The newest one, which many players call the "easiest" yet, sees you taking Link down to a chasm and using a multi-shot bow. Demonstrated in a video from Gaming Reinvented (thanks to reader C3MO for sharing this!) at the bottom of this article, all you need to do is get to Tobio's Hollow Chasm and fire off some arrows with some Fused materials.

Video game merch can be hit or miss for me, but one in particular caught my eye this morning. Remedy Entertainment is teaming up with Finnish lighting company Airam to release a special Oh Deer Diner thermos inspired by Alan Wake.
The special thermos is slated to arrive in September 2023, just ahead of Alan Wake 2, on Remedy's storefront. As you might remember from the first Alan Wake, you could get an achievement for finding the hidden thermos bottles littered throughout the game.
"In the sequel, the thermos plays a significantly more important role," Remedy communications director Thomas Puha said in a press release. "This got us excited about the idea of creating an authentic Oh Deer Diner thermos for our fans."
The collaboration is between two Finnish companies, Remedy and Airam. It's a 0.45 liter bottle with a glass interior. Perfect for that cup of coffee you might want to enjoy while booting up a scary experience in the fall.

Also, enjoy the reveal trailer above, featuring a special guest appearance from a Control character you might recognize.
Oh, deer
As I said above, video game merch is tricky. For me personally, I don't like stuff that's a bit too loud or just a giant logo. Something a bit more subtle, that feels like a representation of that game world rather than an advertisement for it, is my jam.
So with that in mind, even though I've only played a little bit of the first Alan Wake, I dig this thermos. It's sleek and looks well-made. It's a subtle nod, one that might get you an "ah" from friends who've played the game, without looking like a billboard.
Basically, I wish more merch was like this. Fewer over-logo'd T-shirts, more useful items with smart in-game ties.

Those who played Resident Evil back in '96 knew they were experiencing greatness. Discovering that first zombie eating away at a dead body is definitely up there when it comes to the most iconic moments in gaming history. The rest of the game, despite—and sometimes due to—some pretty C-tier writing and voice acting, also left a mark.
While there were plenty of zombie games before Chris Redfield stepped foot into the Spencer Mansion, Resident Evil changed the industry and ushered in a resurgence of the genre across all forms of media. Movies like Shaun of the Dead and 28 Days Later carried on the concepts pioneered by George Romero for a new generation, while properties like Left 4 Dead and The Walking Dead propelled zombie media to pop culture mainstay status.

We take for granted how difficult it is to do a bad thing well, especially in video games. There are plenty of bad movies intentionally made to be fun to watch. Digital marketplaces are full of bad games made badly and good games made poorly, but creating a game that is intended to reflect bad design but is actually fun to play; that takes work.
However, with the emerging sub-genre that I like to call jank-pop, there have been better examples of it. Cruelty Squad, for example, features eye-piercingly garish colors and spaghetti-nest level design, but it winds up being fun to play with its dark but off-kilter sense of humor and deep (sometimes unintentionally broken) mechanics.
Some people take Cruelty Squad way too seriously. However, I don’t think anyone’s …]]></summary>

[Update: A spokesperson for Forever Skies directly reached out to Destructoid on June 2 to clarify that the early access build will have 15 hours of playable content, not 30 (as previously published, taken directly from the Steam page).]
Far From Home has announced that their airship survival and crafting game, Forever Skies, will be hitting Steam Early Access on June 22, 2023.
Forever Skies places you in a disease-ravaged world, where you build and pilot an airship base to find a cure. You manage the weight and integrity of your airship, expand your facilities, and search for new technologies and resources.
https://youtu.be/aMuE0W8XfC4
The developers state that “The Early Access version will offer plenty of mechanics and activities to play within a vast world ready to be explored, all of which will engage players for many hours.” They go on to clarify that the amount of hours is roughly 15. The developers also note that they plan to include co-op in Forever Skies later in Early Access.
Did you ever play Guns of Icarus Online? It was (and, I guess, still is) a great airship game where you and your friends battle against opposing crews. Players would typically take the role of either a gunner, pilot, or engineer. I personally liked being an engineer, and jumping between the various components of the ship and keeping them in tip-top shape and not on fire.
For that matter, my favorite part of Subnautica was exploring the ocean while personalizing my big submarine.
What I’m saying is that Forever Skies seems like my jam, and I’m looking forward to it.
Forever Skies hits PC via Steam Early Access on June 22, 2023. The developers have stated the plan is to keep it there for about a year.

Firaxis Games, the studio behind strategy titles such as Civilization, Marvel's Midnight Suns, and XCOM, has laid off employees in the latest in a series of cuts made at Take-Two subsidiaries.
A report by Axios claims that around 30 employees were affected but the cuts, which the developer's publisher, 2K Games has said were made due to a "sharpening of focus, enhancements of efficiencies, and an alignment of our talent against our highest priorities [...] The studio remains focused on developing critically acclaimed video games."
Firaxis' most recent release was the strategic comic-book title Marvel's Midnight Suns, which launched on PC and Gen9 console platforms in December of last year. While the release was praised for its quality gameplay and usage of the Marvel license, this, unfortunately, did not equate to sales, with the game being considered an unsuccessful commercial release by parent company Take-Two Interactive. Much like another comic-book release, Marvel's Avengers, Midnight Suns was a title that was designed to have a relatively long life in the gaming market.
The layoffs at Firaxis continue a miserable trend of cuts across the entire industry. Since January, roles have been lost at various high-profile developers and publishers including Microsoft, Riot Games, Sega, Twitch, and Ubisoft. Just last month, it was announced that Cyberpunk 2077 developer CD Projekt RED had also laid off members of studio The Molasses Flood, following a restart of the upcoming Witcher spin-off Project Sirius.

It’s been a harrowing year for the LGBTQ+ community, not just in the United States, but across the world. It’s been a record year for anti-LGBTQ+ legislation, which is immensely depressing.
So, for this very important Pride Month, the itch.io Queer Games Bundle returns with the goal of providing some much-needed funds to LGBTQ+ creators who would often be otherwise overlooked. These are people who just want to make or supplement a living making games, art, and other content, and the bundle gives them some money to do just that.
The Queer Games Bundle describes itself as “A bundle of over 450 games, software, and zines from nearly 300 queer artists across itch.io.” A glance over its immense contents shows everything from more mainstream titles like Raptor Boyfriend: A High School Romance to emotionally charged art games like He Fucked the Girl Out of Me.
The hosts of the bundle are suggesting a $60 all-in price tag, but you can pay what you want so long as it’s over $10. Proceeds go to developers who opted-in to get some of the funding.
Note that there is a wide range of topics covered in these games, books, zines, and tabletops, including some decidedly 18+ things. While wading into uncomfortable territory can nurture empathy and an understanding in your fellow humans, your priority should always be to be kind to yourself, so watch what you load up.
So, if you’d like a massive buffet of delicious queer art content to dig into or would just like to support the community of queer creators, take a look at the Queer Games Bundle over on itch.io. You can find the $60 version here, while the pay-what-you-want bundle is over here.

SNK has announced that its incoming update, bringing a much-needed rollback netcode update to the sword-swingin' Samurai Shodown, has been met with an unfortunate delay, and is now expected to launch later this summer on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.
"SNK has been hard at work on the rollback netcode update for Samurai Shodown, originally slated for a spring 2023 release," said the developer in a statement. "The 1st Community Beta Test offered us great insight as to what we needed to improve. However, as a result of various setbacks and extenuating circumstances during development and in light of our ongoing efforts to further enhance player experience, we have made the decision to push back the official release of the update to late summer 2023."
"We deeply apologize to our valued customers and passionate fans who have eagerly awaited this update, as well as for any disappointment this decision has caused."
https://twitter.com/SNKPofficial/status/1664089380242223105?s=20
The studio notes that it intends to hold a second Community Beta Test at some point later in June, on order to further analyze data and fine-tune the new online experience. As I've noted before, Samurai Shodown is a great, highly unique fighter, which stands apart from its contemporaries due to its very specific and deliberate fighting style, which sees high damage landed in just a few hits. Hopefully, the update will help the game's passionate and dedicated community welcome a few newcomers.
Samurai Shodown is available now on PS4, PC, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch. The update will not be applied to the Nintendo Switch edition, however.

The showcase ended with the reveal of Asgard's Wrath 2. The original Asgard's Wrath is one of VR's biggest, most ambitious (and well-reviewed) games. The sequel picks up where the story of the first game left off while adding all kinds of new mechanics. You can find more on Asgard's Wrath 2 in the upcoming issue of Game Informer's magazine, where we spoke with the game's director.

Meta has announced a new version of its Quest headset series. The Meta Quest 3 is a new virtual reality (and mixed reality) headset arriving this fall.
The new Quest was announced this morning, ahead of the Meta Quest Gaming Showcase that's airing today at 10 a.m. PT. Much like its predecessor, the Meta Quest 3 is a wireless VR headset, with a competitive price tag starting at $499 for the 128 GB version.
For upgrades, the Meta Quest 3 is packing a higher resolution display and "pancake optics," as well as a new Snapdragon chip. The internals should, according to Meta, deliver "more than twice" the graphical performance compared to the Quest 2.

Redfall has been a pretty notable stumble out of the gate for Xbox and Arkane. Today, a new report sheds some light on some of the behind-the-scenes tension that led to Redfall's troubled release.
Bloomberg's Jason Schreier has published a new report diving into the development of Redfall, which began in 2018. As the article outlines, it came from a goal of chasing "games as a service", as ZeniMax reportedly urged developers to implement microtransactions.
At Arkane Austin, the team set out to create a multiplayer vampire shooter—Redfall—under co-directors Harvey Smith and Ricardo Bare. But as the story outlines, things got muddy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[No quarters necessary
Veteran coin-op developer Taito and publisher ININ Games announced a release date for a second compendium of arcade classics — Taito Milestones 2 launches on Nintendo Switch August 31.
Taito Milestones 2 revisits the studio's golden era, and contains 10 titles from the late-'80s and early-'90s. Among the games on offer are the excellent platformer The NewZealand Story (1988), the super cute Liquid Kids (1990), and the cult classic Kiki Kaikai (1986). Joining these hits are shmups Metal Black (1991), Darius II (1989), and GunFrontier (1990), and frankly baffling fighting games Dinorex (1992) and Solitary Fighter (1991). DOGOOOON!.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmWboBjoIoo
It's a neat little collection of classics, and it will be rad to have some of these releases on the go, but I still feel we're chasing the ultimate Taito compilation, that marries the excellent Taito Legends games of the PS2 era with the addition are the hard-to-emulate releases such as Chase H.Q., Special Criminal Investigation, and Under Fire. We live in an era where retro comps and re-releases are perhaps more common than they have ever been. But there are a lot of gaps and a lot of crossover between them all, and it all gets a little exhausting after a while.
Regardless, for completionists, Taito Milestones 2 launches August 31 on Nintendo Switch. The original Taito Milestones is available on the same platform right now.

There are a lot of fantastic places that you can revisit in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. Diving down from the Sky Islands was a surefire way to get me chucking out pins like Brightbloom Seeds, leaving my map looking like the sticker-covered front page of a teenager's school notebook. Fortunately, a good few of these places were scrubbed from the list after getting the Regional Phenomena quest from Purah after mere minutes on the ground, but one area that I really, really wanted to head back to remained on my list: Link's 100-year-old water bed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When RPS awarded Kentucky Route Zero the title of Game Of The Year in 2013, only two episodes out of an eventual five had been released. If this sounds like a bland statement of fact, just think about it for a second. I can't recall any other time an episodic adventure game has received GOTY-level praise before it was even concluded, let alone only 40% done.
Episodes three through five arrived sporadically: in spring 2014, summer 2016, and — after what must have been an agonising hiatus — the start of 2020. Having bypassed this wait to play the game for the first time only recently, I feel wistfully as though I'll never share quite the same fond feelings for it as contemporary fans (like our own reviews ranger Rachel, who recently named KRZ one of her all-time favourite indie games). But I'm also quite relieved that I didn't have to exercise that kind of patience. I mean, I'm very good at neglecting to carry on with games for years at a time despite thoroughly enjoying what I've played so far. But I like doing it on my terms, you know?
I initially attempted to do something a bit clever with this retrospective. I wanted to play the first two episodes that earned KRZ our GOTY nod in 2013, and write up on them as a discrete entity as far as possible. Only then did I plan to carry on the game and add some follow-up impressions, perhaps assessing whether I thought RPS would still award the big chocolate medal to the full game as it finally came to be in 2020. But, after sitting with my feelings about Episodes 1-2 for a couple of weeks, any intelligent observations I might have made were drowned out by an increasingly loud, insistent voice in the back of my head howling: "I WANT TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENS." Actually, that might be a good impression to just let stand on its own merits.

If you fancy jumping into a giant robot and causing some heavy metal madness, then Forever Entertainment has some news for you — Front Mission 1st: Remake will launch on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms June 30, following on from its November 2022 Nintendo Switch release.
Front Mission 1st: Remake is a revamped edition of the Japan-only PS1 release, Front Mission 1st, which was itself a remake of the 1995 Super Famicom release, Front Mission. Set in the year 2090, the narrative concerns a brutal conflict between the Oceania Cooperative Union (O.C.U.) and the Unified Continental States (U.C.S.) — a conflict fought with devastating mech units known as "Wanzers". Lol.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfNhYqgGPLE
Players engage in strategic combat across an increasingly desolate wasteland, battling it out with their comrades in a dramatic, story-driven tale that encourages the player to approach the conflict from both sides of the curtain. The two plots intertwine in order to ask and answer each other's questions. The new remake includes a new localization, a reorchestrated soundtrack, and various tweaks and rebalances to the game's modes and mechanics. You can check out Zoey Handley's review of the Switch release here.
Front Mission 1st: Remake launches on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms on June 30, priced at around $35 USD. A 10% discount is available until July 12, and a demo is available now on PC.

SOEDESCO and Superlumen have today revealed a first look at Desolatium, a point-and-click adventure game that will be combining mystery with Lovecraftian myths and creatures on Switch later this year.
The above teaser isn't a lot to go on, it's true, but the publishers note that the game will see you attempting to investigate the mysterious disappearance of a friend through the eyes of four different people. However, it seems that this isn't your standard missing persons case, as things soon take a spooky turn.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Somehow we’re already in June, which makes me both cosmically confused about the passage of time and quite happy because it’s now Pride Month. That also means that queer indie developers have once again banded together and organised the third annual Queer Games Bundle on Itch.io, offering over 450 video games, board games, zines, books, soundtracks, and other creative stuff for the price of one AAA game: $60. All proceeds are split between the participating developers, and there’s some very cool stuff included. 


“Purchasing the Queer Games Bundle is a direct action that you can take right now to support queer people in a life-changing way,” reads the bundle's description, “and in exchange, you get over 450 amazing, heartfelt, fun, and radical games and artworks.”

During my cover story trip to Tokyo, Japan, to speak to developer Creative Business Unit III, I learned a lot about magic in FFXVI and how it affects Clive’s life and everyone in this world. The special tattoo on Clive’s face is the mark of a Bearer, which indicates he can use magic. This might seem like a great ability, but the nations of Valisthea view Bearers as something other than human. These nations brand their Bearers to show they are enslaved, and nations trade Bearers across borders based on who needs their magical abilities. When Clive receives this branding, h…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some employees at Bethesda's Arkane Studios reportedly hoped that Microsoft, after acquiring Bethesda in 2020, might cancel Redfall or reboot it as a single-player game, according to a new report from Bloomberg. 
That didn't happen, however, and Redfall launched on May 2 to poor reception from critics and players. Game Informer gave it a 5 out of 10 in our review. Xbox head Phil Spencer said on Kinda Funny Games' Xcast that he was disappointed with the Redfall launch. "I'm upset with myself," he told the Xcast.
Despite hopes for a new approach to the game following that 2020 acquisition, Microsoft remained hands-off and allowed development on the title to continue as normal, save for canceling a PlayStation 5 version of Redfall.

We've also been playing some video games this week, how about that! Including the click-fest game of the moment, the remake game of the moment, and a whole other thing I hadn't heard of. So actually James does have a use after all. Plus: he finally got hold of a ROG Ally!

Thanks to a series of Apple-related tweets from Hello Games' Sean Murray, many have speculated that No Man's Sky was coming to Mac. Now, that dream has become a reality, as it transpires that the universe exploration game has now become available for the Windows alternative.
The news comes from the man himself on Twitter, announcing the Mac version via a promotional video. Along with the teaser, here's an overview of what No Man's Sky fans will be treated to in this port. Namely, the space-faring title will have cross-play and cross-save, all the updates that have occurred over the last seven years, and more. Best of all, it's completely free to those who own the game on Steam.
https://twitter.com/NoMansSky/status/1664257765349498880
Murray also tweeted another little nugget of information, which shows that the Mac version also supports VR. According to a report from Eurogamer, the game will run on any Mac that uses Apple Silicon. Therefore, the Mac Mini, Mac Studio, MacBook Air, and MacBook Pro should be suitable. The requirements on Steam say you will need an Intel i5 processor and at least an AMD Radeon Pro 570X @ 4 GB, as well as macOS Monterey 12.3.
Once considered one of the most tumultuous video game launches ever, those who abandoned No Man's Sky would be forgiven for assuming things hadn't moved on. However, you couldn't be further from the truth. With a series of free updates that have significantly improved the experience while also delivering new content, Hello Games has really turned the tide. It even won a BAFTA in 2022 for "Best Evolving Game." That's certainly a different story when compared to how things were in 2016.

What’s important to know about Loop8: Summer of Gods, and possibly the reason why we haven’t seen a demo for it yet, is that it’s not an RPG in the traditional sense. Yes, there are stats to build and monsters to fight, but the latter is a small part of the final package, while the former is achieved through completing a small number of tasks each in-game day. It’s better to think of Loop8 as a social simulator rather than an RPG. Just picture the Princess Maker series and you’re halfway there.

Moreso, the next mainline historical Total War aims to capture the struggles and instability of a time period for which ancient Egypt simply had the best seat in the house. “We wanted to make a game about the collapse of the Bronze Age,” Creative Assembly Sofia’s  Milcho Vasilev, lead battle designer on Total War: Pharaoh, tells me. “There’s a lot of mystery surrounding it, and we wanted to uncover it.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sonic the Hedgehog co-creator Yuji Naka could serve two and a half years in prison as part of his sentencing for insider trading charges. 
Abema Times reports that prosecutors on the case asked that Naka go to prison for two years and six months in a Tokyo District Court today, as reported by Video Games Chronicle. Prosecutors also demanded that Naka pay a fine of 2.5 million yen (roughly $17,900) as well as a supplementary penalty of 170 million yen (roughly $1.2 million). Naka's defense asked that this fine and prison sentence be reduced, but a final decision on the matter isn't expected until July 7, VGC reports. 
Naka, who also directed Balan Wonderworld, was arrested in November in connection to an insider trading investigation involving the reveal of a new Dragon Quest game. Naka was accused of purchasing 10,000 shares worth 2.8 million yen (roughly $20,000) in Aiming, the company behind the new mobile Dragon Quest game. 
Then, less than a month later, Naka was re-arrested on a second charge of insider trading, this time involving the now-defunct mobile battle royale, Final Fantasy VII: The First Soldier. Naka reportedly purchased 120,000 shares in Ateam, the developer behind the game, for approximately 144.7 million yen (more than $1 million). 
Now, Naka has been charged and could face more than two and a half years in prison alongside more than $1 million in fines. A final decision on his charges is expected next month.

        <updated>2023-06-01T13:02:08.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been waiting for this
In mid-2022, I got a message from Destructoid legend Jordan Devore telling me to drop everything I was doing and play Escape Academy. Mere hours later, my wife and I bought the season pass. That's a good sign! The second DLC of that pass (Escape from the Past) is due out on June 19, according to Coin Crew Games. It's priced at $9.99 piecemeal or as part of the aforementioned $14.99 pass.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqPHLGlUzHM&t=1s
 
Here's a quick blurb on the conceit of the DLC:
"Step into the past for Escape Academy’s second Expansion Pack, joining old friends and Academy students Sandra Solange and Eel Barnes on a mission to unmask a villain who wants their Headmaster dead. After an 'accident' at an Academy sport event, Sandra and Eel are tasked with investigating each of the suspected faculty members to deduce who the killer is and save the school."

There's an announcement trailer you can check out above, but we don't recommend watching it! It's better to go in blind, especially if you enjoyed the core game.
[caption id="attachment_383304" align="alignnone" width="640"] Image via iam8bit[/caption]
The first DLC (Escape From Anti-Escape Island) came out in November 2022
So far, this seems to be it for Escape Academy once June 19 hits. The first DLC, Escape From Anti-Escape Island, came out at the end of November, and went with a "deserted island" theme. While it wasn't nearly as strong as the base game; even with a lowered bar and short length, it was more fun than many other similar escape room/modern puzzle games.
Hopefully the second DLC will bring it!

With most of our minds firmly focused on Tears of the Kingdom, it can be easy to forget that there are, in fact, other games out there (who knew?). And so, with that in mind, this is your friendly reminder that Splatoon 3's newest update, Sizzle Season 2023, has inked off the start line today.
Announced back in May, the official @SplatoonNA Twitter account has been drip-feeding us information about what the new season has in store and — spoiler — it's a lot. Alongside some sweet new weapons like the S-Blast '92 and Painbrush, this latest update also introduces the Challenges game mode, fresh maps, an original catalogue and much more.

Break-ups suck. There are no two ways about it. You spend so much time feeling confused, desperate to make things work, and even a little trapped. That’s kind of what it’s like to play Maquette. Annapurna’s latest release (developed by newbie Graceful Decay) uses puzzles to tell the story of a relationship breakdown. Initially released on PlayStation and PC in 2021, it now brings its pretty puzzles to the Switch.
The game takes place in a sequence of fantasy worlds that meld Disneyland-esque castles with Tuscan gardens, carnivals, and beaches. Each world comes with mind-bending challenges and the layers of a relationship story at its heart. The title ‘Maquette’ describes a scale model on which a sculptor bases their final art piece. It refers to the game’s landscape-within-a-landscape, and it’s also a nod to the two main characters’ love of art.

According to a report from Abema Times, (as translated by VGC) Sonic the Hedgehog co-creator Yuji Naka is facing 2.5 years in prison — in addition to receiving a $1.2 million (USD) fine — for his role in insider trading schemes that took place during his time at developer Square Enix.
The punishment is being requested by the prosecutor's office at the Toko District Court, who argue that Naka had violated Japan’s Financial Instruments and Exchange Act, stating Naka had shown "no signs of remorse" for the offense. Naka was first arrested in November 2022 under suspicion that he had used insider knowledge in order to draw large sums of money on the stock market. Naka was then re-arrested again a month later on additional charges.

In the Netherlands, ISP KPN went up against BREIN recently, citing concerns over its application for a shape-shifting dynamic injunction. KPN couldn't prevent Lookmovie and Flixtor from being blocked but the discussion was one worth having.

But without fail, I’ll dunk half a jar of those salty little bad boys into my bubbling wok without hesitation. Peppers? Why not. Carrot? Absolutely. Spinach? Don’t mind if I do. My bolognese is about as authentically Italian as Super Mario, but it doesn’t matter. I’m not trying to make Massimo Bottura cry by reminding him of his nonna’s cooking. It’s a dreary Tuesday night and I’m craving my olive-laden concoction. I’m making this bolognese just for me.


Slayers X: Terminal Aftermath: Vengance of the Slayer reminded me a lot of my bolognese. It’s a game created for particular tastes, a unique proposition that sort of defies conventional thinking. A big, bold swing that -  if you have the palate for it - is absolutely brilliant.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Plus a Trek to Yomi
The PlayStation Plus monthly game lineup for June 2023 is out, and it's got a strange mix of titles. Sports fans, archaeologists, and sword aficionados will all have something to look forward to in June, at the least.
For June 2023 PlayStation Plus is getting NBA 2K23, the most recent entry in the basketball series, for PlayStation 4 and PS5. Reviews on this particular entry seem medium-warm, though I'll admit, I haven't played some virtual hoops in quite a while. My go-to is NBA Street, personally. But if you want to play the modern-day, professional basketball, this a cheap way to try it out.
Otherwise, if you're a bit more keen on dinosaurs, Jurassic World Evolution 2 is also on this month's docket. These dinos (probably) can't play basketball, but they can cause havoc for you and your parkgoers. Ever think you could run Jurassic Park and have it not turn into a terrifying mess? Well, this is your shot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g76Zx7zydXQ
If you just want a cinematically inclined, action-driven story about a swordsman, Trek to Yomi can cover that. Following Hiroki, a blademaster who fails in his vow to protect the people he cares for, you can expect a lot of slicing and dicing in this 2D action-adventure game.
Of course, a new month means we see some old games depart. If they look appealing, make sure to get them before they're gone. Here's everything coming and going on the PlayStation Plus monthly lineup in June 2023. You've got until June 6 to lock them onto your account.
Coming to PlayStation Plus monthly games in June 2023
NBA 2K23 (PS4, Ps5)
Jurassic World Evolution 2 (PS4, PS5)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dillon rolls into the sunset
Vanpool Inc. is closing its doors. The Japanese studio, known for both its support work on Nintendo games as well as its own games, such as Dillon's Rolling Western, has announced it is shutting down.
The news was posted on the studio's official site, saying the team has decided to disband. No overt reason was given, but the studio does express gratitude for its fans.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNUer6t0bl4
Vanpool was one of the studios started by former Love-de-Lic developers, alongside studios like Punchline (Chulip, Rule of Rose) and Skip Ltd. (Chibi-Robo!, LOL).
Back in 2001, Vanpool released its first game with Endonesia on the PS2. From there on, it made some fun, unique games; Dillon's Rolling Western, for one. And there's also the bizarre, memorable Freshly-Picked Tingle's Rosy Rupeeland.
A slight tingle
Alongside its own games, Vanpool also supported several Nintendo titles. The Kirby series (including Forgotten Land and the recently released Return to Dream Land Deluxe) dots Vanpool's resume. The studio also contributed to Paper Mario: Sticker Star and Chibi-Robo! Zip Lash.
It's a shame to see a studio like this go. It's hard not to think of Alphadream, or the curiously quiet Skip Ltd. mentioned before, too. These studios, and their history, represent a different kind of games than we usually see. And it's a team that played a role in Nintendo's recent success with Kirby, too.
Hopefully, everyone involved lands somewhere new.

“We actually get this question kind of a lot – people ask us if the rating went up because [we] wanted to make a more violent game, and the answer to that is no,” producer Naoki Yoshida says. “On the outside, it doesn’t appear [the rating system] has changed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Finally, a justification for all that plastic
Today, Nintendo finally unveiled some more details for the upcoming September 1-4 "Nintendo Live" expo in Seattle, Washington: and there's a crazy curio buried in that memo. While the customary competitive events for Smash, Mario Kart 8, and Splatoon 3 will commence as normal, an amiibo tournament is also happening.
Here's the full schedule of all of the events being held at Nintendo Live
Gaming tournaments:
Sept. 1: On the first day of Nintendo Live 2023, the Super Smash Bros. Squad Strike tournament will be open for fans ages 13+ who want to show off their versatile skills in the Super Smash Bros. Ultimate game.
Sept. 2: The Mario Kart 8 Deluxe 2023 Championships will be held on Sept. 2, with an on-site last-chance qualifier for those looking to race their way onto the big stage.
Sept. 3: On Sept. 3, the spotlight will be on the next generation of fighters with the Super Smash Bros. Ultimate amiibo+me Exhibition 2023. Attendees 10-16 years of age can train up their amiibo fighters and take on other entrants and their amiibo fighters to see who will win.
Sept. 4: Closing out the event is the Splatoon 3 2023 Championships, featuring the top qualifying teams from the upcoming Splatoon 3 Championship Qualifiers 2023 coming up June 3-4 and June 10-11.
Note the curious addition of "Super Smash Bros. Ultimate amiibo+me Exhibition 2023" According to the brief description of the event, attendees "10-16 years of age" will train figures to fight in CPU matches. It's a fascinating feature that should have been pushed a bit more at launch, especially since every single Smash line amiibo works with it.
You can find all of the latest info on Nintendo Live here. You have until June 22, 2023 to register.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you woke up in a mysterious mansion, with no memory of how you got there and only a walkie-talkie and a bunch of security cameras for company, how d'you reckon you'd handle it? Personally I know, sure as eggs is eggs, that I would absolutely go to pieces. I'm not hitting the end credits of The Tartarus Key in real life, but fortunately, it's a nails thriller puzzle game that fuses PS1-style retro graphics with Saw-esque murder traps. Plus, you know, it's only about six hours end to end, which isn't bad for a semi-magical kidnap plot.
In this situation I am not me, of course, but Alex Young, and Alex upon escaping a locked study (an easy warm-up puzzle involving postcards) she finds and frees Torres, an ex-cop turned private detective, who sets up a base of operations around the mysterious mansions main fireplace. From there game's rhythm is clearing the different wings of the house by completing increasingly difficult puzzle rooms, each eventually culminating in finding a new person to save from a new death trap - concocting the antidote for poison or following the instructions to get through an electrocuted floor maze.
It's an odd group, but if you rescue everyone you start to see the edges of a wider story. There's a nice layering of paranoia, because most of the puzzles have an element of, for want of a better word, magic to them. One of the very first sees you tasked with getting an academic out of a living flesh-blob, and failure results in it and him vanishing into nowhere. You also find an underground lab with notes on scientific experiments, and a holding cell slash testing chamber - but given that next door is a giant meat freezer sokoban, is it not the case that the lab is just another puzzle room set? The low-poly, low-draw distance style of everything really adds to this, and you keep suspecting that some new puzzle or trap or maybe a weird murderer is going to suddenly loom out of the darkness in front of you. It's the kind of head melting I haven't had since playing Old Gods Rising.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I feel like claymation has always been a bit creepy, you know? Yeah, sure the Aardman films are whimsical and fun, but have you seen those early Wallace and Gromit shorts? There’s something kind of unsettling about the odd shape of Wallace’s uneven head and I've always deeply hated that you can sometimes see the subtle lines of a thumb imprint on parts of his face, like he’s been smothered inbetween the pads of two giant fingers. It’s so uncomfortable - and don’t even get me started on that monster Morph.
Ever since I first spotted the creepy Twitter gifs of claymation game Elation For The Wonder Box 6000, I’ve felt that same discomfort in the pit of my stomach. It’s not out yet, or even has a confirmed release date, but I just need people to witness this game. Like, just clicking through the screenshots make the hairs on the back of my neck stand on end. It’s awful, and wonderful. You can watch the trailer below. The bit where the lumps of clay wriggle inside the gun's bullet chambers goes through me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of my absolute favourite elements of Citizen Sleeper is how you essentially play as a nobody. When we first meet the Sleeper they've had their memories completely erased; the last thing they remember is stuffing themselves into a cargo container and shooting off into the depths of space - a last resort in wanting to escape the clutches of a scary corporation. They now find themselves on a dishevelled space station called Erlin's Eye, desperate and alone. They're essentially an empty shell, and one which you can etch your own story onto.
But it’s not their lack of personal identity that makes the Sleeper a nobody (after all, you essentially forge an identity for them as you make decisions throughout the game). It’s the realisation that, in this vast universe that developer Gareth Damian Martin has written, you’re no one. A single grain of sand in a vast desert. No one knows who you are, no one cares about you, and you’re stuck on a lawless space station, helpless, scared, and dying.

It’s an interesting aspect of this story because it speaks to how broad its horizons might be. What starts as a revenge story will grow into one of war, its effects on people, and ultimately, Valisthea’s place in a fight between Eikons, Dominants, and more over crystals. 
It also means we’ll be seeing a lot of Clive’s life. During my cover story trip, I played a few of FFXVI’s opening hours, much of which took place in the past, when Clive is just 15 and his younger brother Joshua even younger. I learned a lot about their relationship with each other as well as with their parents, and more I won’t spoil here. But I also flashe…]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-05-31T15:02:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For a licensed racing game, 2021’s Hot Wheels Unleashed was a fun and respectable debut, and now we’ll get to see how developer Milestone builds on that foundation with an upcoming sequel. 
Hot Wheels Unleashed 2: Turbocharged arrives on October 19 and retains the fun “little toy car in a big world” presentation with new additions under the hood. Players can now get behind the wheel of motorcycles and ATVs, and the game has over 130 vehicles total at launch.
Players race across five diverse environments using new skills: double jumping and lateral dashing. The double jump can be performed at any time to leap over rivals and obstacles, while dashing is great for sideswiping nearby opponents or dodging hazards. Milestone touts increased interactivity between vehicles and objects on and off the track, and playstyles can be customized using perks earned by earning skill points. 


Modes include a revamped story-driven campaign starring four original characters, complete with animated cutscenes. Other challenges include events designed to test players’ skills such as drifting and evading crashes. For online multiplayer, the game supports cross-play (except on Switch), and players can now create friend parties. Local two-player splitscreen also makes a return. 
The popular creation suite from the first game now features a refined Track Editor with expanded features and a Livery Editor update introducing the Sticker Editor to create and save custom patterns and shapes. Best of all, all user-generated content will be sharable cross-platform at launch, though it's unclear if any player-made content from the original can be imported into this game. 
Hot Wheels Unleashed 2: Turbocharged will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC. Check out some of the sequel's cars in the screenshot gallery below.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[“Oh yeah, we’ve got the System Shock IP,” said the insurance company. “What do you want to do with it? Do you want to make a sequel?”


It’s a question you could imagine being posed to Ken Levine, or Warren Spector, or several other notable designers who could reasonably lay claim to the legacy of Looking Glass and Irrational’s legendary immersive sims. Instead, it was asked of Stephen Kick - at the time, a recently unemployed videogame artist holidaying in a Guatemalan hostel. Up until that point, Kick had dedicated his life to creative pursuits. He had no business background, and none of the acumen required to understand contracts or negotiate licensing fees. More to the point, he had no more than $5,000 to his name. Hardly the foundation for a follow-up to two of the most acclaimed PC games of all time.

Nonetheless, Nightdive Studio’s System Shock remake stays resolutely faithful to the Looking Glass original even when giving it a modern 3D makeover, with a retro flourish in its intentionally pixellated textures.
As a snappy little After Eight to the main course of Jeremy Peel’s review and OG System Shock oral history (both great, do go read those first), here’s a look at how the 2023 remake’s visuals compare to the trailblazing immsim’s previous iterations. In other words, the 2015 System Shock: Enhanced Edition, also by Nightdive, and the original. Well, System Shock Classic, which is basically the original except it runs on my PC.

The Fable games used sparkly breadcrumb trails as a waypoint of sorts and the clip also had some jolly fairytale music on top, leading many to guess that the long-dormant series would finally rear its head again.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[2021's Resident Evil: Welcome To Raccoon City blended together the stories of the first Resident Evil game and its sequel, Resident Evil 2 (which received a fantastic remake in 2019), and while it wasn't a complete knockout hit, some have been asking for a sequel. It seems one might be on the way. 
According to a new report on Sudbury.com, a news organization that covers the Greater Sudbury area in Canada, which is where Resident Evil: Welcome To Raccoon City was filmed, Sudbury is receiving an $11 million injection from the provincial government, as reported by PCGamesN. This government is funding 20 local projects through the Northern Ontario Heritage Fund Corporation and while a sequel to Resident Evil: Welcome To Raccoon City hasn't officially been named as one of those 20 projects, there is one called "Umbrella Chronicles," and it's receiving $2 million. 
If you're familiar with the Resident Evil series, you know "Umbrella Chronicles" is likely a nod to The Umbrella Chronicles spinoff game. Add in that the film company behind "Umbrella Chronicles" is Raccoon HG Film Productions, the same company behind Resident Evil: Welcome To Raccoon City, and the picture gets a little clearer: we might be getting a sequel. 
It's important to note this isn't an official confirmation of a sequel. Perhaps Raccoon HG Film Productions is making a different Resident Evil movie unattached to Resident Evil: Welcome To Raccoon City. Only time will tell. 
In the meantime, watch our interview with two of the 2021 film's stars and then check out this featurette from Resident Evil: Welcome To Raccoon City with some behind-the-scenes details.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Playing Diablo 4 gave me a real case of the "have I changed, or have the games changed?", and I think the answer is "yes". For the uninitiated, Diablo forms one of the jewels in Blizzard's crown (maybe a smaller one, just offset to the Warfcraft centre stone), an action-RPG series that's like if the kind of 90s metal album cover that has a skeleton on it asked to be turned into a game where you explode many hundreds of near-identical monsters to get incrementally better loot. This is a spoiler-free review of the latest greatest addition, following 2012's Diablo III, but a Diablo game's story is sort of unspoilable, both because a) paying attention to it is of passing importance to playing, and b) the plot of them is always basically the same anyway.
To wit: Sanctuary, a high-fantasy world with a low-fantasy vibe, where so much as going to the next town over will be a brush with some horrible little goblin rat called a Flesh Thresher, was created as a respite from the eternal battle between heaven and hell. After X number of years of relative peace, one (or many) of the Lords Of Hell is doin' some bad stuff. Usually Diablo, I'll grant you. In this case it's Lilith, a kind of Dante's Lady Dimetrescu, who's making people horny for being stepped on power. Diablo games have always had a Grand Canyon sized gulf between the cinematics (epic; luscious; brutal) and the game in practise (clicking). IV is no different. And you know. It's fine.

I’ve spent dozens of hours roaming Sanctuary over the last two weeks, having completed the campaign, hit level 50, unlocked the Paragon Board, graduated to World Tier III, and devoured as much post-game content as I could in the allotted review period, such as the Whispers of the Dead missions and Helltides. 
However, I’m not ready to assign a score until I’ve gotten to play the game under normal conditions: with the servers live and teeming with players hunting Lilith. That means you won’t see a full review until I've spent a good deal of time with the launch version of the adventure. Until then, I’ll give my impressions on the things I can talk about.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart is the next first-party PlayStation title making the jump to Steam on July 26, marking the series' first appearance on PC. 
The 2021 dimension-hopping adventure served as one of the earliest showcases of the PlayStation 5’s tech (namely it’s fast-loading SSD), and the PC version sports additional bells and whistles such as: 
Performance-enhancing upscaling for Nvidia DLSS 3, AMD FSR 2, and Intel XeSS
Unlocked framerate
Ray-traced reflections/shadows
Ultra-wide support for 21:9, 32:9, and 48:9 monitors


Developer Nixxes Software is handling this PC port of the acclaimed action platformer, which sees Ratchet & Clank fighting to stop their old foe Dr. Nefarious from conquering the multiverse with the help of Ratchet's alternate universe counterpart, Rivet. In our review, we scored the game a 9 out of 10, with former editor-in-chief Andrew Reiner writing, "It’s a great continuation of the series that is just a joy to play. It steals your eye with its stunning vistas, makes you care about the characters, and is loaded to the hilt with fan service (especially in the alternate dimension and a weapon you have to assemble)."

On one hand, you likely want to appeal to the fans of the series, and on the other, you want to attract new players. But it’s impossible to please everyone when making big changes like developer Creative Business Unit III is doing with Final Fantasy XVI – using a real-time action combat system that couldn’t be further from the series’ classic turn-based roots. 
As someone who loves the franchise’s turn-based format and its more action-forward design as of late, and as someone who’s played FFXVI for more than five hours at this point, I’m quite pleased with the combat. It’s fast-paced, action-heavy, and perhaps most importantly, fitting of this world and these characters. I especially like the singular focus on Clive,…]]></summary>

Here was a drive that didn’t really move gaming performance beyond the best SSDs of the PCIe 4.0 generation, but could boot general read and write speeds into the stratosphere. That could be worth upgrading to, if the T700 itself stayed within reach of most PC owners.
Reader, the price is not right.

Professional procrastinators can now rejoice as there’s a new way to play the blocky puzzler: Setris, or Tetris with sand.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The October 2022 announcement of Silent Hill: Ascension, an interactive streaming series from Genvid Entertainment and Konami, raised some eyebrows from fans but provided little in the way of details. Today, Genvid broke its silence by not only giving us new details on the series but also a trailer.
In this series, which will unfold simultaneously across the globe, those watching can help decide the fates of Ascension's main characters. This means that as the story plays out, the audience will have a say in who survives the surely horrific story, who will be redeemed or damned by their actions, and who will suffer the almost certainly ghastly consequences. According to Genvid Entertainment, not even the developers will know the results of the story until it unfolds.
Silent Hill: Ascension features an ensemble of new characters, monsters, and locations within the Silent Hill universe. Genvid has crafted a real-time interactive system that allows viewers from around the world to decide these characters' fates within the narrative the studio has crafted. Beginning later in 2023, fans can tune in to live story moments where each day is different based on audience interactions. 
Silent Hill: Ascension is set to stream later this year. If this unique concept has piqued your interest, you can check out the reveal trailer below.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For a certain sort of PC gaming fan, System Shock is where it all began. 30 years of immersive sim development started here, as Looking Glass escaped the restraints of the RPG genre and embraced thoughtful first-person action. SHODAN broke free, and the world was never the same. Without System Shock, there would be no Thief or Gloomwood, no Prey or Dead Space. Bioshock was conceived as its sequel. The creative figureheads behind Deus Ex and Dishonored were wrapped up in its creation, and forever changed by contact with Looking Glass and its unique philosophy.
Countless studios have used Citadel Station as a star to steer by, measuring their own work against System Shock’s commitment to simulation, dense atmosphere, and method-ish refusal to break character. This was not so much a game as an alternate reality. As one of our interviewees tells us: “We were trying to build the holodeck.”
Here’s the story of how it was made, as told by the people who made it.

It’s no secret that Street Fighter V got off to a disastrous start, and despite years of course correction, its flawed foundation made a comeback difficult. By contrast, Street Fighter 6 is a thorough response to its predecessor’s failings, defined by well-considered central mechanics, formidable single-player offerings, and a plethora of smart decisions that make for a powerful opening punch.
Those primarily interested in duking it out against other players have a lot to look forward to; between the snappy movement and wealth of strategic op…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in February 1991, Capcom released Street Fighter 2 to arcades. Unbeknownst to Capcom at the time, Street Fighter 2’s massive success would cause it to become the blueprint for fighting games - a genre the game effectively created upon its release. This blueprint proved to be so influential that even some of Street Fighter 2’s most underwhelming elements are still being parroted in fighting games today. As a result, more than 30 years later, one constant in the fighting game genre has always remained true: the story mode is gonna suck.
There have been some valiant attempts at rectifying this in the last decade, but the core issue has always remained the same; fighting games are inherently designed to be played against other people, and back-to-back fights with AI controlled characters will never be able to properly match the competition of the real thing. Yet, with Street Fighter 6, Capcom have seemingly done the impossible. Street Fighter 6 has the best story mode in any fighting game I’ve played. Admittedly a low bar, but still, Capcom could have easily half-assed the story mode, just as so many other fighting games still choose to do, and still have been widely praised based solely on the strength of its multiplayer. Instead, Capcom are offering fighting game developers a new blueprint to copy - one that prioritises teaching new players above everything else.

        <updated>2023-05-29T19:45:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Final Fantasy XVI’s combat is fast, chaotic, and, most importantly, fun. There are plenty of combos to pull off, and in just the small taste of the action during my cover story trip to Square Enix’s Tokyo, Japan, office, I saw so much variance in setting up Clive’s combative abilities that I can’t wait to see what others do in-game. 
I also watched combat director Ryota Suzuki play through some of the most challenging encounters in the game, and unsurprisingly, he excelled, taking maybe one or two hits in the 20 minutes he played. He used combos I didn’t really comprehend – admittedly, he was playing at a much later portion of the game than I had hands-on access with – and it got me thinking: is he excited to see what players do with FFXVI’s combat, much like I was sitting there watching him pull off intricate combos against myriad enemies? 
“I’ve always tried to give players a lot of freedom when it comes to the controls and the action in the game, and give them lots of options that they can take and then do their own thing with,” Suzuki tells me. “So I’m expecting that there’s going to be a lot of weird things that they’re going to do with certain abilities. I can’t say what those abilities are, but I already have a few ideas because I’ve left a lot of things open-ended in that way. 
“I’m really excited to see what players will do with them because there are definitely things that I didn’t expect, but I do like putting that stuff out there so that they have stuff to play with and surprise me with. When they do things I expected, I’m happy, but I’m also really happy when they [...] do something that is completely unexpected. It’s one of the exciting things about being a developer.”
Like Suzuki, I look forward to seeing what far more advanced players do with FFXVI’s combat, and fortunately, we have less than a month to go.

While the Dolphin team is investigating its options, the project is currently "indefinitely postponed." Here's the full quote from their blog post:
It is with much disappointment that we have to announce that the Dolphin on Steam release has been indefinitely postponed. We were notified by Valve that Nintendo has issued a cease and desist citing the DMCA against Dolphin's Steam page, and have removed Dolphin from Steam until the matter is settled. We are currently investigating our options and will have a more in-depth response in the near future.
We appreciate your patience in the meantime.

At the very least, remakes offer a great way to play antiquated or less accessible experiences on modern hardware. 
The remake boom has been in full swing in recent years to the point that it’s starting to get tough to keep track of all the projects in the works.

In a similar spirit, the same team now has a new robotic collectible coming to market, this time emulating the Optimus Prime character as he appears in the new Rise of the Beasts live-action film. Instead of full transformation like the previous G1-style incarnation, this new collectible is built as a display piece that can shift between various aerial action poses, speak lines of dialogue, and respond to voice and app commands from your phone or other device.
The figure features 21 precision servo motors and 69 microchips. Even before mounting on his included stand, Prime stands at 16 inches tall.
The team even brought in legendary voice actor Peter Cullen to reprise his role and record brand-new lines for the character to spout.
The new Rise of the Beasts Optimus Prime limited edition collectible will put you back a hefty sum; it’s currently on a preorder sale of $699 (instead of the regular price of $899). If that's not too high a price for controlling an intergalactic hero, he's all yours. The vaunted Aubobot leader will be ready to head out on a mission to your home in the fourth quarter of 2023.]]></summary>

While I attribute most of that to how great it feels to control Clive, it turns out there might be some tricks developer Creative Business Unit III learned developing Final Fantasy XIV’s action to make FFXVI’s combat feel even more satisfying beyond the actual gameplay.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When my Sleeper escaped their ramshackle life on the fringes of Erlin's Eye at the end of last year, they left behind a lot of unfinished business. I had to stop short my efforts to help Bliss make a go of her repair bay business, and Tala was left to finish making her brand-new distillery on her own. Yatagan agent Rabiyah probably has my name on an employment blacklist, too, after I upped sticks without telling them, and the spores of mushroom algae I'd been cultivating for Riko over in Greenway were no doubt left to rot and moulder somewhere. Instead, I jacked that all in to smuggle myself, my engineering pal Lem and his tiny daughter Mina onto a ship headed for some far-flung star out in the void. The Sidereal ship wasn't going to wait. It was now or never.
Fortunately hitting an ending in Citizen Sleeper doesn't mean the end of your save. Booting it back up again for this month's RPS Game Club, I wanted to play out a different ending to my Sleeper's story. Turning my back on Lem and Mina still brought its own kind of sadness, admittedly, but I wanted to dig into the game's trio of free DLC episodes first and foremost, as that was another thing I never got time to start last year. I've only played through the first chapter, Flux, so far, but man alive, it was not an auspicious start for the refugee flotilla ship hoping to make a new life for themselves here. In fact, I don't think it could have gone any worse, such was the monumental failure of my collective dice rolls and decision making. But despite absolutely beefing it in Flux, I also came to realise an important lesson. It's okay to fail, and that failure can often make the consequences of your actions feel all the more poignant. Sure, it might not feel nice, and yes, I wish it could have gone better. But sometimes the odds really are stacked against you, and you've just got to roll with it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Final Fantasy XVI’s Valisthea is sprawling, comprising a mix of five main nations, various more-linear dungeons, and some open field areas. The primary focus of FFXVI will be playing through Clive’s story and all it entails, but there’s more to the game than just the main scenario. 
I was curious about how players will get around Valisthea, especially with developer Creative Business Unit III at the helm. In its MMO, Final Fantasy XIV, mounts are abundant. You can ride chocobos, the Regalia from Final Fantasy XV, Magitek armor, and more. There are dozens of mounts to acquire in-game, and I wondered if that would bleed over into FFXVI. 
“To tell you the truth, it’s pretty much just chocobos,” FFXVI director Hiroshi Takai tells me. “In past Final Fantasy games, you’d have canoes or boats or …]]></summary>

After the Steam Deck proved that handheld gaming PCs could flourish outside of a microscopic niche, it was surely only a matter of time before one of the big PC hardware movers would have a crack at the concept. This time, with more powerful internals, and none of the SteamOS compatibility problems that led to Valve creating a whole new verification system.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Most video games are too big. Their lands are too expansive, their histories over-explained, their playtimes too long. Most of everything is too long (songs, books, movies, everything) but it's especially felt in games, where the magical "What's next?" feeling of discovering a world often fades to leave the "What task must I complete now?" drudgery of playing a video game. So I hugely admire Cosmo D's Off-Peak series, which has built the feeling of a huge and fascinating city through only four tiny locations visited across four games with a combined playtime of under eight hours.

It's also extremely unfair on Smalland Colon Survive The Wilds, a lovely survival game about being a teeny tiny person in the wilderness, where bottlecaps serve as tabletops and beetles are a deadly threat. It is absolutely comparable to Obsidian's garden adventure, but a peer rather than a pretender. I even prefer it in some ways, but they have such a different vibe that there's plenty of room for both.

But I was also given an exclusive tour of FFXVI’s endgame and other supplementary content by creative director Hiroshi Takai and combat director Ryota Suzuki. 
It’s safe to say there’s plenty to play, especially if you enjoy chasing numbers in combat. 

FFXVI features an Arcade Mode, allowing players to run through stages they’ve already completed, this time with an on-screen score calculator and combat grader. But a New Game+ playthrough opens up two additional versions, and both are more difficult than the game’s base Story Mode and Action Mode difficulties. It’s important to note you can play through New Game+ on one of these base difficulties if you’d like, but you’re missing …]]></summary>

Here are the patch notes from Nintendo's website:
Ver. 1.1.2 (Released May 25, 2023)
Additional Fixes
Alongside fixing the audio issue and the Camera Work in the Depths quest, the "Several issues have been addressed to improve the gameplay experience," note is covering a lot of ground. It seems most if not all of the duplication glitches players discovered, which allowed them to duplicate rare items in the game with suprisingly little effort, have effectively been removed from the game, according to posters on the r/NintendoSwitch subreddit.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The latest Pokémon Trading Card Game expansion, Scarlet & Violet – Paldea Evolved, arrives next month. As the name implies, this new version delivers plenty of evolved forms of Paldean Pokémon while expanding on the pre-existing catalog of Paldean and non-Paldean monsters.
This second expansion in the Scarlet & Violet series of cards brings with it more than 190 new cards, including 15 Pokémon ex cards, Tera Pokémon ex cards with a crystalline appearance, more than 30 Trainer cards, and dozens of Pokémon and Trainer cards with special illustrations. The Pokémon Company sent over several booster packs for us to open and see what we could pull, and those with the special illustrations ended up being the highlight of my pack-opening experience.
You can see my favorite of the cards I pulled in the gallery below.

I was pretty happy with the cards I pulled from the packs. My favorite is probably the special Elite Trainer Box Pikachu card, which features the three Paldean starters in the background, though I also love the Pikachu I pulled from a booster pack. Outside of that, I enjoyed seeing the various Paldean starters' evolved forms, though, for some reason, my pulls skewed heavily toward Quaxly's evolution line. Outside of this most recent generation of Pokémon, I was happy to snag some updated cards of old favorites, such as Gyarados, Raichu, and Tyranitar.
In addition to being the second Pokémon Trading Card Game to bear the Scarlet & Violet name, it's also the second pack to come at a higher price tag. However, The Pokémon Company has at least tried to deliver some benefits to this, as each pack includes more foils, and even the wrapper of each booster pack feels thicker and of higher quality than the original Scarlet & Violet expansion.
Pokémon Trading Card Game: Scarlet & Violet – Paldea Evolved arrives on June 9. For all things Pokémon Trading Card Game, head to our special hub by clicking the banner below!]]></summary>

Before Resident Evil and Silent Hill, 1992’s Alone in the Dark helped lay the foundation for 3D survival horror before the genre even had a name. Players explored a haunted building laden with elaborate puzzles and scary monsters, with gameplay emphasizing thoughtful management of scarce resources. It even featured two playable characters with separate scenarios, an idea later adopted by Resident Evil 2. Numerous sequels of varying quality followed, but it’s been many years since the series was culturally relevant.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During my hands-on time with Final Fantasy XVI for our cover story, I play through the game’s opening hours, which feature moments from Clive’s childhood when he’s 15 years old and a flash forward to a 28-year-old Clive. Here, Clive meets Cidolfus Telamon, or Cid for short – because this is Final Fantasy, after all. Shortly after, Cid brings Clive to a place dubbed Cid’s hideaway. 
This hideaway is one of the main hubs in FFXVI. While I’m not sure of its location in Valisthea, the continent where the game takes place, it looks built into a cavernous structure. It features a pub where you speak with locals about what’s going on in the world, side quests to pick up, and a music player, as well. I discover music tracks exploring Valisthea, and while these are new tracks from the score of FFXV…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[2023 has seen the closure of more big multiplayer games than, well, any time I can recall in recent memory. One after the other, developers' dreams of making the next big Destiny-like have gradually collapsed in on themselves. Like a deflated concertina, their last honks of life have been crushed down to desperate, fizzling squeals as servers lie empty and the cost of maintaining them spirals out of control. Some are still hanging in there, sure, but the genre as a whole feels like it's at a tipping point - and I couldn't help but sigh as five more multiplayer shooters joined the fray last night as part of Sony's PlayStation Showcase.

These entities would have permission to interface with online services and directly flag content to be rendered unavailable, minus the usual friction. In its 2023 IP Index report, the US Chamber of Commerce suggests that the introduction of 'trusted flaggers' in the EU may actually represent a new barrier to effective enforcement.

The beta will be available to anyone who's already pre-ordered the game, and it will run until the game's release. We still don't know when that final release date will be just yet, but if you're keen to see how 40K translates to a good old-fashioned classic RPG, at least you should have a fair old while to see what's up.

Developed internally at Frontier, it promises to be a modern take on the classic RTS, giving you four unique factions to play with, including the Stormcast Eternals and Orruk Kruleboyz, across a single player campaign and 1v1 and 2v2 competitive multiplayer modes. I got to see a little bit of an alpha build of Realms Of Ruin in action ahead of tonight's Skulls stream, and if you're a fan of tabletop miniatures, this is definitely an RTS you'll want to keep an eye on, as Frontier have gone all out on making this look as close to Age Of Sigmar's TT origins as they can. Here's what you need to know.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When discussing Final Fantasy XVI’s combat or watching gameplay, it’s hard not to think about other action combat games, such as Capcom’s Devil May Cry series. And if its combat reminds you of DMC, it’s probably because the combat director of FFXVI is Ryota Suzuki, who helped design combat on Devil May Cry 4 and Devil May Cry 5. But he also worked on Marvel Vs. Capcom 2. 
While the DMC inspirations laced within FFXVI’s combat are hard to miss, Suzuki told me that Marvel Vs. Capcom 2 inspired some of FFXVI's systems as well. 
“There’s actually something from Marvel Vs. Capcom 2 that we took and put into Final Fantasy XVI, and that is, as you may or may not know, in Marvel Vs. Capcom 2, we had the Assist system where you could give orders to your partner in battle,” Suzuki says. “And by impl…]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-05-25T12:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Atari and developer Sneakybox have announced Days of Doom, an apocalyptic turn-based tactical roguelite. The game hopes to subvert the expectations of those who are tired of the brown and gray color palettes of other apocalypse settings by placing the action over vibrant and colorful backdrops as you battle through hordes of zombies, raiders, and mutant lizards. 
Navigating the wasteland to reach a sanctuary will require strategy, as you must combat the encroaching mutated forces using your group of distinct survivors. Beyond the turn-based tactics at play, you must also manage your scarce collection of resources and keep your wits about you as you maneuver through the hordes of the undead.

Each of the eight survivor classes features unique abilities that can be used to shift your fortunes in battle. For example, the Pyro class allows you to burn enemies and leave them with residual damage each turn while combining the Hydromancer with the Thrasher can drench enemies with water before electrocuting them for a devastating synergy. Players will need to use these abilities to their advantage and think strategically with these abilities to overcome the seemingly insurmountable odds.
And, of course, with it being a roguelite game, players can expect each run to feel unique. More than 50 randomly occurring events present risk-reward scenarios for players during their runs, while more than 70 collectible items and runes can help you turn the odds in your favor in your given run. However, as you play several runs and make progress, you unlock permanent upgrades, such as party size increases and resource accumulation speed.

Hence why Phantom Blade Zero has perked me up to no end, as it's an action RPG announced at last night's PlayStation Showcase which marries Chinese martial arts with a steampunk aesthetic. I'm on board, if cautious! The action seems rad, but it's so fast, it's hard to tell how it actually plays.

These sound like straightforward rereleases of the classic stealth games and I'm cool with that because I am deeply wary of Konami touching Metal Gear at all. I just want Snake Eater on PC at long last. Konami are vague about platforms, but I'm expecting/hoping we'll see this collection on PC? And more vintage Gears Solid might follow.

The remake was originally supposed to come out four months after its reveal in 2021, tripped into 2022, and was then delayed indefinitely after switching developers. Essentially, this sounds like a Benjamin Button situation.

In fact, I’ve had about as much fun with it as I would on a spa day in the Barad-dûr sulfur pits. Between the soulless platforming, undercooked stealth, tedious storytelling, and framerate stuttering so bad it’s got me killed twice, Gollum is perilously short on likeable qualities. Especially if you’re not into LOTR lore, or fine hattery.
In my unclad head, then, Gollum’s highlight so far has been DLSS 3. It’s one of just a few dozen games to support the newest, most artificially intelligent version of Nvidia’s deep learning-powered upscaler, and frankly makes a very compelling argument for switching it on. Graphics card allowing, obviously.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today’s PlayStation Showcase saw Square Enix unveil a squeaky-clean online shooter called Foamstars. 
This wacky new multiplayer shooter pits two teams of four against each other using weapons that shoot, you guessed it, foam. Battlefields are covered in soapy foam, which players can use to their advantage by creating slippery surfaces to slide at high speeds. Foam can also be used in other ways, such as to shield yourself and your teammates from attacks or create vantage points. The trailer shows off a bunch of goofy weapons and the game pretty much feels like the anti-thesis of Splatoon. 


Square Enix promises to share more about Foamstars in the future, but it’s coming to PlayStation 5 and 4.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The 2020 first-person action title Ghostrunner has garnered a strong community of fans thanks to its precise controls and high-octane action. Perhaps that's why, less than a year following its initial PC release, a sequel was announced. However, outside of some concept art, we haven't seen or heard much from developer One More Level or publisher 505 Games.
However, that changed today, as the studio released a first gameplay look for the highly anticipated sequel. Revealed during today's PlayStation Showcase, the trailer shows the game's cyber-ninja protagonist, Jack, participating in the series' trademark fast-paced, always-forward combat and traversal. According to the team, the sequel looks to elevate the formula in every category, including the addition of vehicular combat.
You can see the trailer for yourself below.

Marathon was first released for the Apple Macintosh in 1994 and was a first-person shooter centering on a space-faring security cop fighting to stop an alien invasion. It was followed by two sequels, with the third entry arriving in 1996. This new Marathon sports a distinctly vibrant look and will also be a first-person shooter, but is a PvP extraction-style experience. Players control a runner in order to, according to the game's website, "compete for survival, riches, and renown in a world of evolving, persistent zones, where any run can lead to greatness."


The game's website also has the following synopsis:

At the tail end of that announcement, however, was another exciting, admittedly smaller announcement that the first three Metal Gear Solid games will be ported to PlayStation 5 in one presumed package.
The single image above appeared at the end of the Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater remake teaser with the words, "Sneak back into the original games on PlayStation 5," with an autumn 2023 release window. The package is called Metal Gear Solid Master Collection Volume 1, which implies more Metal Gears may be on the way. A Volume 2 could, hopefully, finally free Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots from its PlayStation 3 prison – the only platform that game has ever been made available on.
Update: According to the game's listing on the PlayStation Store, the package will also include the original Metal Gear and Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake. Here is how the the listing of included games is worded on the page.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last time, you decided that fighting your double is better than optional challenges giving rewards upfront. I am an impartial observer here but oops oh no I have accidentally copy/pasted a remark from commenter Oli Baba, who said "Rewards upfront is one of the coolest mechanics to grace gaming and seems to be losing only because so few people have come across it." Whoops, I really must fix those hotkeys. Next, I ask you to choose between cooly saying nothing, or being told how cool you are. What's better: a silent protagonist, or combat style ratings?

Mostly, we used to store a lot more personal information when you created an account, like email addresses, passwords, etc. As we now use GitHub to handle all that, we can slim down our privacy policy, as we store very little personal information. For the cookie policy, for years now we only use cookies for the authenticated part of our websites and nothing else. OpenTTD’s privacy policy has always been: we want to know as little personal information about you as possible. And although these changes were rolled out years ago, the policies did not reflect that yet. They do now! In short: we removed statements from the policy about information we track, as we haven’t done that for years now. So, what about this automated opt-in survey you are talking about?]]></summary>
