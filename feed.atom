None of Success’ shooting games, however, can rival the impact of their 1991 cute-’em-up Cotton: Fantastic Night Dreams. Thanks to energetic pacing, a delightfully vibrant world, and a protagonist witch with an abundance of idiosyncratic character, the original Cotton and its many sequels have become deeply cherished by the shmup community, and have had a profound influence on the evolution of both the cute-’em-up sub-genre, and 2D shooters more generally.

If you were looking to add the mythical Pokémon Shaymin to your party or your Pokédex in Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Pokémon Shining Pearl, today’s your lucky day. 
That’s because Shaymin will soon be available to catch in the remakes later today as a Mystery Gift event. Announced during today’s Pokémon Day stream, which also saw the reveal of Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet alongside the Daybreak Update for Pokémon Legends: Arceus, Shaymin hits the game via something called Oak’s Letter. 
After receiving the Oak’s Letter Mystery Gift, you’ll be able to encounter Shaymin and catch the mythical Pokémon and add it to your team. As noted by the trailer, it takes approximately two hours of play time before the Mystery Gift feature is unlocked in new playthroughs of Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl. 
You have plenty of time, though, to take part in this Mystery Gift event because while it’s live starting today, it will be remain live until March 27 so you have over a month to add Shaymin to your Pokédex. 
While waiting to receive Oak’s Letter, read about the Pokémon Legends: Arceus Daybreak update, which is out later today, and then watch the reveal trailer for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. 
Are you excited to add Shaymin to your party? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

Pokémon Legends: Arceus is getting a new update, Version 1.1.0, otherwise known as Daybreak, later today. 
Announced today during the Pokémon Day stream, which ended with the reveal of Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet, Daybreak will add a new investigation to Game Freak’s latest pocket monster RPG. You’ll be tasked with beginning an investigation into a new phenomenon that is causing a mass outbreak of what appear to be Alpha Pokémon.

As you can see in the trailer above, the phenomenon is causing some of the most challenging types of Pokémon in the game to appear all over the place and it seems it will be up to you to figure out first what’s going on, and then discover a way to stop it. It’s not a bad time to be catching some powerful Pokémon if you’re up to the challenge, though. 
The Daybreak update will also bring new Pokémon battles to the training grounds in-game. Seemingly addressing one of players’ biggest complaints, this new update will make it so that there are more Pokémon battles against other trainers to take part in. As for how many or how often, who knows but fortunately, we don’t have to wait long to find out because the Daybreak update hits Pokémon Legends: Arceus later today. 
To coincide with Pokémon Day, players who use the password "ARCEUSADVENTURE" in-game will receive 30 Ultra Balls, 30 Gigaton Balls, and 30 Jet Balls. 
For more, read Game Informer’s Pokémon Legends: Arceus review and then read about Generation 9, which was just revealed today as Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet.

During the first 'Digimon Con' earlier today, the Digimon games producer Kazumasu Habu was queried about the possibility of the team porting, remastering, or remaking the original Digimon World game, originally released on the PlayStation in 1999.
The good news is he's "positively considering it", but he's not entirely sure how to go about it just yet, or what way would be best. Here's exactly what he had to say, courtesy of Gematsu:

As you might recall, last March - Sony Interactive Entertainment and esports business RTS jointly acquired the fighting game tournament Evo. Nintendo, at the time, said it would continue to "assess" Evo, as it planned for future Super Smash Bros. tournament activity.
It seems a decision has now been made. According to an announcement from the team at Evo, Nintendo has decided to withdraw Super Smash Bros. from the event. It's admittedly a massive blow, as the series has been featured at the fighting game tournament since 2007.

If you're willing to make that journey, you'll also be greeted by two new DLCs which adds Studio Ghibli tracks and music from classic Bandai Namco games.

After tackling Metroid in season 1 and then Halo in season 2, Game Informer's Video Gameography podcast turns its gaze to one of Sony's biggest properties: Uncharted. Now, halfway through the series, we reach one of the more divisive entries: Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception.  
Developed by Naughty Dog, Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception was a big release for Sony's PlayStation 3 console on November 1, 2011. After the success of Uncharted 2 and it's blockbuster setpieces, Naughty Dog upped the stakes and pushed to include even more spectacular action moments. Unfortunately, that put a toll on development. In this episode, we talk about Uncharted 3's renewed focus on melee combat, how Last of Us' development impacted the team, and why Uncharted 3 almost shipped with a game-breaking bug. 
Join hosts Ben Reeves (@BenjaminReeves), Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), and co-founder and the CEO of Kinda Funny Greg Miller (@GameOverGreggy) as we unpack the history and impact of Nathan Drake's third outing.  
If you'd like to get in touch with the Video Gameography podcast, you can email us at podcast@gameinformer.com.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["I’ve always viewed Zelda: Minish Cap as the height of pixel art".
The list of games overtly inspired by Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda franchise isn't small, but it's nevertheless impressive to see what some of the smallest development teams, in particular, can achieve. Ocean's Heart is a recent example on the Switch eShop, a game that's been upfront in acknowledging its sources of inspiration.
With attractive pixel-based visuals and plenty to discover in its world, we gave Ocean's Heart a recommendation in our review. Most impressively, though, it's largely the work of a solo developer, Max Mraz. The core game was a one-person endeavour, though its path to Switch has been an interesting one too, as it's a trailblazer for the Solarus engine, which has been used for a significant number of Zelda fangames. Ocean's Heart is the first time that engine has been utilised on Nintendo's hardware; it was also the first game using the engine to be released on Steam.

Nintendo yesterday added another game to its Switch Online Expansion Pack and updated the N64 library to Version 2.0.0.
There have been all sorts of improvements, but this latest update is even better than expected, it seems. According to "Zelda 64 researcher" and Twitter user Fig (as highlighted by Nintendo dataminer OatmealDome), the emulation of The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask on the Switch Online service is actually "more accurate to N64" in one "situation" than it was on the Wii Virtual Console version.

Fun fact: Pokémon is the highest-grossing media franchise of all time. Bigger than Star Wars, Marvel, and even Super Mario himself, the Pokémon franchise is far and away the most successful series the world has ever seen and for good reason – have you seen how cute the little critters are?
It probably makes sense, then, that you or someone in your life is a big Pokémon fan, and there's no better time to celebrate your love for the series with Pokémon Day just around the corner.

Another week has passed in the Nintendo Life, and after a few rather frantic weeks in gaming news it was a little calmer overall. There were interesting reveals, though, with Capcom Fighting Collection in particular getting plenty of retro gamers hot under the collar. Meanwhile it was confirmed that Next Level Games has been working on the new Mario Strikers, and that imposter Elden Ring started jostling with Super Mario Odyssey for critical supremacy - the cheek! In lighthearted news we saw a Star Wars droid turned into the coolest Game Boy accessory ever, and we enjoyed the realisation that the Nintendo 64DD had more online features than Switch.
Now it's time to chill out and discuss our weekend gaming plans. A few members of the Nintendo Life team have done just that below, so feel free to give our entries a read and then join in with your own via our comment section. Enjoy!

Jurassic World: Camp Cretaceous is an animated series on Netflix that ties into the Jurassic theatrical releases, much like The Clone Wars connects to the Star Wars movies.

Gran Turismo 7 launches on March 4, and driving sim enthusiasts are in a tizzy asking themselves one burning question: how would the game's beautifully rendered cars look if Kirby ate them? You haven't seen it, but they're definitely wondering about this.

Prolific clay artist, North of the Border, has done it again: After making an incredible take on the Great Wave off Kanagawa with a Wind Waker twist, he's now made an entire set of Kirby Mouth figurines in anticipation of the upcoming Kirby and the Forgotten Land.
There's Vending Mouth Kirby, Ring Kirby, Light Bulb Kirby, Cone Kirby, a slightly upsetting bursting Water Balloon Kirby, and of course, the beloved Car Kirby (Carby) — who gets his own video:

Are you tired of Mouthful Mode, or are you a good person? Haha, just kidding. Everyone loves Mouthful Mode. What's your favourite one? Tell us in the comments!

Martha Is Dead starts extremely strong, introducing immediately a dynamic between twin sisters Martha and Giulia that sets the stage for the entire game. Giulia’s mother never loved her the way she loved Martha, and this relationship, or lack thereof, has eaten away at Giulia’s spirits for years. After Giulia finds Martha, drowned in a lake, her mother runs to embrace Giulia, mistakenly believing her least-favorite child perished. Finally, she gets the love and affection she’s always wanted. What happens next is unexp…]]></summary>

Margit The Fell Omen is the first mandatory boss you’ll encounter in Elden Ring. You’ll find his fog gate inside the Castleward Tunnel, which begins at the top of Stormhill, the wind-swept lands northeast of the starting area called Limgrave.

If you’re still trying to figure out how to beat Margit The Fell Omen, we’ve got you covered.

Note: Brian is out on assignment this week, so this episode was recorded a week early. If any noteworthy news hit over the last week, All Things Nintendo will cover it next week.

Every adventure is a journey of some sort, but we are often so consumed with the destination we sometimes forget to enjoy the ride. Far: Changing Tides pushes you to soak in the small moments that can be overlooked in our rush to reach the peak. Okomotive newest side-scrolling platformer is a meditative odyssey full of trials and triumphs. But this pilgrimage is so powerful I was often content to forget about my end goal.

Drag your fella's facial features around to form expressions, and that emotion will be the foundation of his behaviour in conversation. It's an interesting challenge on a timer, and the intentional performance of emotion feels perfectly sinister when maybe we know a little too much about a missing person. Who's Lila? does have a demo, so you can pull some faces yourself.

Valve’s Steam Deck launches today, meaning its first wave of customers will soon be gaming on a shiny (and very large) handheld PC and looking for things to play. The device can’t play every title and Steam recently rolled out new library categories to better label which of your games work on the Deck and which don’t. Publisher THQ Nordic has assisted on this front by revealing which of its many titles are playable on Steam Deck at launch.  
In a press release, THQ has listed the following titles as Steam Deck Verified. That means they’re fully functional on the handheld:
Darksiders II Deathinitive Edition
Darksiders Genesis
Desperados III
This is the Police 2
The next batch of titles is Steam Deck Playable. This is a step below Verified status because while these games work on the device, they may require some manual tweaking to get them running at full capacity:
Battle Chasers: Nightwar
Biomutant
Darksiders: Warmastered Edition
Destroy All Humans! (2020)
Elex
Expeditions: Rome
MX vs ATV All Out
Spongebob Squarepants: Battle for Bikini Bottom - Rehydrated
This is the Police
There are currently over 300 titles confirmed to be playable on Steam Deck and that number will grow as Valve and developers work to get games running on the handheld. Other confirmed titles include Persona 4, Dota 2, Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy, Inscryption, and Valheim.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over the course of my Steam Deck review testing, the majority of games I tried ran without issue. Some didn’t get on with SteamOS’s Proton compatibility software, and others needed a bit more work on the ol’ anti-cheat, but I wouldn’t be surprised if most Steam games end up rated as Verified or Playable in Valve’s compatibility review programme.
What, then, are some of the very best games to play on the Steam Deck? Personally I’ve most enjoyed the ones designed with thumbstick controls in mind (like Horizon Zero Dawn and Death’s Door) but since I was interviewing Gabe Newell and members of the Deck dev team in the run-up to the Steam Deck's launch today, I took the chance to ask them if they had any suggestions. Here's what they've been playing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From Ubisoft to Konami to the Epic Games Store, games companies are doubling down on NFTs as fast as others are backtracking on them. Valve, on the other hand, aren’t likely to get involved any time soon, owing to “a lot of criminal activity and a lot of sketchy behaviours”. That’s according to co-founder Gabe Newell, who recently spoke to us about his concerns around crypto.


While indie game store Itch.io declared NFTs a scam, Newell is more open to the “underlying technology of distributed ledgers” – but says there are just too many bad actors using that technology for nefarious endeavours, namely fraud and money laundering. Steam banned games with NFTs and cryptocurrency last year.

A few minutes into playing on this – the first serious attempt at a handheld PC from a major gaming entity - and I am once more a child, alternating between sinking into the sofa to redirect energy into my thumbs and wanting desperately to rush round my friends’ houses to show them the cool new thing. 


Not that the Steam Deck is a nostalgia exercise, given it’s built to run the very latest AAA games as much as it is indies and retros. And it certainly isn’t twee: from its no-nonsense, all-black design to the performance-tweaking options in its OS, the Deck is a serious device, even and especially when it’s serious about giving you a good time. That’s in spite of some imperfections, to be sure – the software, screen and battery life may disappoint anyone expecting another top-end Valve hardware masterclass to follow their Index virtual reality headset. But the Steam Deck is more accessible, more affordable, and far more useful to have on a train.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The consolidation of the games industry – that is, games companies being bought up and absorbed by bigger games companies – has been increasing, intensifying, and giving poor Ed the aches. Exhibited most dramatically by Microsoft stumping up $69 billion for Activision Blizzard, this trend towards conglomerification has raised worries about both creative expression and the potential locking-down of more games to certain platforms.
Valve president and co-founder Gabe Newell is no stranger to making some additions. Valve famously hired the student developers of Narbacular Drop to work on what eventually became Portal, and acquired Firewatch developers Campo Santo in 2018. In our recent interview, I asked him whether he thought consolidation could be a problem for the industry going forwards.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Valve’s long-awaited Steam Deck is finally here, offering up a portable gaming solution with broad appeal. The nature of that appeal is quite different depending on your perspective. Some primarily console-focused gamers may find a low-cost entry into at least part of the PC gaming experience. For more dedicated PC players, it provides a chance to take what may already be an extensive Steam library on the go – albeit with only specific titles optimized right now. Either way, the Steam Deck is an impressive first step into a promising future of portable PC play – with some significant issues holding it back from greatness.

Blood West isn't the same as Hunt, but they're definitely related. It also wears its love of Blood on its sleeve. It also also carries Thief DNA, and even takes some notes from Dark Souls, a game I dislike because it's bad and everyone is just wrong. Most remarkably though, Blood West feels almost entirely itself, rather than just an assembly of other things. It's really damn good.

Elden Ring is doing very well – its Steam numbers are already nearly six times greater than From Software’s previous all-time high – but some players have criticized the game’s performance, particularly on PC. 
From Software has released a new launch-day message specifically addressing the performance issues some are experiencing in Elden Ring and it seems some fixes could soon be on the way. The message addresses issues happening on console versions of the game and PC versions of it, too.

It's called Onbu and it couldn't give a monkey's that you're on its back just trying to get by. At first, that is. Eventually you're able to strike up a bit of a relationship with the big lizard and build a sort of symbiotic relationship. Onbu stays on track, Onbu gets a treat. Good Onbu.
I'm not usually one for strategy games where you've got to manage rocks and wood and allocate workers. Some of that comes down to their many systems frying my little brain, but Onbu has me persevering. Why? Because the resources I'm harvesting and community I'm building help or hinder Onbu. My enemy isn't some army a mile away, it's Onbu.

There's something to be said about witnessing a historic moment firsthand.
From Software's Hidetaka Miyazaki pioneered the Soulsborne genre, a smart subversion of conventional action RPG mechanics brimming with marvelous setpieces, writhing horrors, and certain death. After Demon's Souls' triumphant launch in 2009, From Software's rise to prominence was all but guaranteed … or so I've been told. You see, I don't doubt the reported brilliance of the studio's catalog; I've just never experienced it for myself. Until now, that is.

Mention a harrier anywhere outside of an ornithology summit and people will assume you’re talking about the hovering aeroplane rather than the diurnal hawk. Tell somebody your harrier is hungry and they’re as likely to chuck a vole into a turbine as they are to feed it into your pet bird’s gullet. 


So it’s unsurprising that Tiny Combat Arena is about Harriers of the cold and featherless kind. The one-person dev team behind the air-to-air combat simulator is apparently in love with the floaty-shooty jumping jet, so much so that it’s the only type of plane available to fly in the game's early access release. The retro-styled sim lets you pore over the low-poly plane as it rests in the hangar, to rest your chin in your hands as you lovingly scroll through its various specifications, inspecting its payload like you’re checking a dog over for ticks.

It is very clearly similar to 2019’s Grid reboot, although there is immediately one thing that’s changed that makes this offering worth the upgrade.

Even though your car slides at every opportunity, it’s actually disguising the fact there’s a great deal of grip here, making for an enjoyable experience whatever your skill level.

Being a hero is no easy task, and it’s doubly hard when you’re the new savior on the block. With every new console generation comes new franchises and returning favorites. Everyone knows characters like Master Chief and Samus are great heroes – some of our favorites, even – but what about the new faces donning a mask for the first time, or those who have found themselves fighting for good against all odds? What about the ones who have simply fallen into a bad situation but have come out better for it? 
Those heroes are some of the best in recent memory, and with a couple more outings in …]]></summary>

Russia has openly attacked and invaded Ukraine after weeks of mounting tensions between the two countries, with dozens of Ukrainian citizens reportedly killed by bombings. As the world watches this historical (and frankly, terrifying) event unfold, efforts have begun to help aid civilians caught in the crossfire. That includes 11Bit Studios, makers of the acclaimed 2014 anti-war survival game, This War of Mine. 
11Bit, a Polish studio, has announced it is heavily discounting This War of Mine, its expansion and console port The Little Ones, and its DLC across all platforms for the next week. The game is currently 75-8o% off, dropping it down to $4.99 on Steam and $3.99 on consoles. 100 percent of the profits made during this sale will form a fund that will be donated to the Ukrainian Red Cross. In This War of Mine, players oversee and care for a group of civilian survivors of a devastating conflict in a commentary of the horrors of war. You can read 11Bit’s full statement below. 
11 Bit isn’t the first European Studio to condemn the attacks. S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 developer GSC Game World, which is based in Ukraine, posted its own call for support, saying in part:
If you want to help our neighbors overseas, you can donate directly to the Ukrainian Red Cross here.]]></summary>

Fortunately, thanks to a new Steam page, you can sign in to your account and quickly see what’s verified for Steam Deck, what’s playable, and what won’t work on it. It takes less than a minute and you’ll see four different categories for your Steam Library games: Deck Verified Games From Your Library, Deck Playable Games From Your Library, Unsupported Deck Games From Your Library, and Untested Deck Games From Your Library. 
Here’s what each means, according to Valve: 
Deck Verified: Valve’s testing indicates these titles from your Steam Library are fully functional on Steam Deck, and work great with built-in controls and display.
Deck Playable: Valve’s testing indicates these titles from your Steam Library are functional on Steam Deck, but might require extra effort to interact with or configure. 
Unsupported: Valve’s testing indicates these games in your Steam Library currently don’t function on Steam Deck. Valve is continuing to add support for more games over time. 
Untested: Valve’s testing team hasn’t yet gotten to the remaining games in your Steam library, but we’re testing new games every day. Come back often to see more of your library get Verified. 
You can sign in to your Steam account here to see which of your Steam Library games are Steam Deck verified and ready to play. After that, check out these images comparing the Steam Deck's size to the PlayStation Vita and the Nintendo Switch.

Cult of the Lamb is a delightfully demented-looking title by Massive Monster and Devolver Digital that became one of our most anticipated indie titles when it was first unveiled last August. The game lets you control a cute lamb and form a demonic cult. Fun! PC had been the only confirmed platform, but a new update has announced that Cult of the Lamb will spread its influence to consoles.
That would be PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and Switch, to be specific. Unfortunately, a release date remains elusive, but Cult of the Lamb is still targeting 2022.

In Cult of the Lamb, you play as a possessed lamb who must repay a debt to a mysterious stranger who saved their life. That repayment comes in the form of forming a cult dedicated to this stranger’s name. You’ll travel across the procedurally generated land spreading the good (?) word to seduce followers by preaching sermons, holding dark rituals, and gathering resources to construct idols and other structures of worship. Combat is of the hack ‘n slash variety as you cut down rival cult leaders, non-believers, and monsters. The game looks wild, and we hope it lives up to its potential when it arrives later this year.]]></summary>

But before it was on the front page of Steam and selling like hotcakes, it was a Half Life 2 mod cooked up by designer and writer Dan Pinchbeck and a group of friends. “I was doing a PhD, weirdly, on first person shooters,” Pinchbeck says. As part of that, he had been reading a lot of game studies, but had mixed feelings about sitting back and talking about what could, should, or ought to be done in games. “I was like, ‘Well, we could just build [something],’” he says. “That felt much more in the spirit of games as a medium anyway.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony has asked a court to dismiss a class-action lawsuit against it first filed in November of last year that alleges gender discrimination within the company. 
Former Sony IT security analyst, Emma Majo, sought court approval to turn her case into a class-action lawsuit last year on behalf of other women who worked for the company in the past. She alleged that “Sony discriminates against female employees, including those who are female and those who identify as female, in compensation and promotion and subjects them to a work culture predominated by men,” as reported by Axios last year. 
Now, Sony is asking a court to dismiss Majo’s class-action case against it, citing a lack of facts to support the claims presented in the lawsuit, Axios reports. 
“Despite the sweeping breadth of her lawsuit, the allegations in which [Sony Interactive Entertainment] categorically denies, she fails to plead facts to support either her individual claims or the claims of the broad-based classes of women she seeks to represent,” Sony’s lawyer wrote, according to court documents. 
Furthermore, Sony writes in documents that Majo failed to “identify a single policy, practice, or procedure at SIE that allegedly formed the basis of any widespread intentional discrimination or had a discriminatory impact on women,” and that Majo’s “widespread claims of harassment are based solely on unactionable allegations of run-of-the-mill personnel activity.” 
Sony also asks the court to recognize what it calls a conflict of interest, too. Majo’s lawsuit includes an attempt to include all women who worked for SIE. Sony says this would include all of Majo’s managers since 2017, which were all women. Sony’s lawyer says that if those managers are included in the suit against Sony, “irreconcilable conflicts of interest” rise. 
Only time will tell if the court approves Sony’s request to dismiss the case.

Contrary to what I say on the recording, this is in fact episode 175 of the Electronic Wireless Show podcast. I probably got it wrong because I'd been up all night at the discotheque. Yes, this week we're taking a suggestion from the listeners and talking about our favourite nightclubs in games. And three more qualified people to talk about clubbing you would not meet.
But first this week there's some big Henry "Vitamin H" Cavill news to get out of the way, plus we discuss drinking animal blood in VIP sections (which is what rich people do), and at what point it stops being cool to go to a nightclub. For me? Almost immediately. And me and Matthew have actually been playing a game, but it's a PlayStation game so please don't listen to us talk about it. But you should definitely listen to Matthew's Hitman-themed Cavern Of Lies.

I'd like to wax lyrical about a good boss in Elden Ring, if you don't mind. He's a beastman, of sorts, who awaits you at the end of a castle. But more than that, he's an optional challenge that both leaves a lasting impression and doesn't at the same time.

Elden Ring finally hits consoles and PC tomorrow, and today, one day before its release, Bandai Namco and From Software have released the patch notes for Patch 1.02, which is essentially the game’s day-one patch. 
In it, you’ll find numerous fixes, bug squashes, and more. If this day-one patch is like previous ones, it’s likely you won’t even be playing the game until after this update has been installed. If you’re buying the game physically or already have it pre-loaded with a digital purchase, this update will likely be pushed before you begin the game.

Here’s what to expect from Patch 1.02 in Elden Ring: 
Improved player controls
Addition and adjustments of background music
Text adjustments
Balance adjustments
NPC event fixes and adjustments
Fixed frame rate drops under certain conditions
Fixed text bug in some languages
Fixed a bug that prevented the Xbox wireless headset from working properly 
These patch notes also include a quick note about the game’s forthcoming implementation of ray-tracing, citing this support is planned for after the game’s launch tomorrow and that more details about it will be revealed in “future announcements.” 
While waiting for this patch to download and install, read Game Informer’s Elden Ring review to determine why we gave it a 10 out of 10.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is the game where you peel a dead woman’s face off. You do it slowly, with a blunt dog tag, making several raggedy incisions before tearing off the face proper. After lingering over the resulting mess of blood, muscle and bulging eyes, you then place your recently drowned identical twin sister’s face over your own. It’s just a dream, but still, this is far from the only time Martha Is Dead insists you do something unspeakable, nor is it even the only time you’re forced to desecrate your sister’s corpse. 


Apart from poor writing, these excessive, brute force attempts to disturb define Martha Is Dead. They suck. Horror games are allowed to be horrific, but the way to cultivate real fear is through restraint rather than desensitising bombardment. For the most part Martha just made me frown and go “ew”.

        <updated>2022-02-24T13:28:36.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer:
      Nintendo
      
Nintendo has announced that it is acquiring SRD Co. LTD., a long-time development partner that has worked on titles within franchises like The Legend of Zelda and Super Mario.
If you’ve been paying attention to the video game industry as of late, you likely already know that 2022 has so far been defined by one word: acquisitions. 
It started with Take-Two Interactive, the parent company behind the Grand Theft Auto series, announcing back in January that it was acquiring mobile giant Zynga for nearly $13 billion. Then, a week later, Microsoft announced that it was acquiring Activision Blizzard, the company behind Overwatch and Call of Duty, for a colossal $68.7 billion, and then two weeks later, Sony revealed it was buying Bungie, the developer behind Destiny 2, for $3.6 billion.
Nintendo revealed earlier this month that despite acquisitions happening throughout the industry, it wasn’t going to change its investment plans. It also revealed that it’s not against acquisitions they deem necessary and it seems acquiring SRD was the next necessary move for the Kyoto-based company. 
SRD was founded in 1979 and has worked closely with Nintendo for decades, as reported by Video Games Chronicle. Not only has it worked with Nintendo on Mario and Zelda games, but the studio has helped develop Animal Crossing entries, Game Builder Garage, 1-2 Switch, and Ring Fit Adventure. This acquisition transaction is expected to be complete by April 1, 2022, and at the time of this writing, a price has not been named. 
Nintendo said in a statement that acquiring SRD will “serve to strengthen the management base of SRD and secure the availability of software development resources for Nintendo,” according to Video Games Chronicle. 
Today’s news about this acquisition is the first following Nintendo’s purchase of Luigi’s Mansion 3 developer, Next Level Games, back in January of last year.

      Sony Interactive Entertainment
      
Since the previous PlayStation 4 and Xbox One generation of consoles, game captures such as screenshots and videos have become more and more popular. With the start of this current generation back in 2020, it was clear that PlayStation and Xbox were going to encourage us even more to share our best captures. 
Doing so on Xbox Series X/S, and even Xbox One, has been relatively easy when it comes to getting images and videos off of the hard drive and onto your phone, for example. You simply capture what you want and in a few minutes, it’ll be automatically uploaded to the official Xbox app. From there, you can save and download the image to your phone, which makes sharing it on social media a breeze. However, that wasn’t possible on PlayStation, despite how much players wanted this feature…until now.

As you can see in the video above, PlayStation has rolled this feature out for PS5 players. You’ll need to enable it in your console’s settings and the PlayStation App first, of course, but after that, screenshots and videos under three minutes long will be automatically uploaded to the PlayStation App. They’ll remain there for 14 days and during that time you can save and download any images or videos you want to your mobile device. And, much like with Xbox game captures, this makes it much easier to share your captures with friends and others on social media. 
For more about the PS5, read Game Informer’s list of the top 10 PlayStation 5 games and then check out these details about the latest PS5 beta, which adds extra party chat options, game base enhancements, UI changes, and more to the console. Read about the PS5 covers and new DualSense colors after that.

The 2D beat 'em up by 13AM Games and Wayforward lets up to two players assume the gargantuan roles of monsters and mechs to lay the smackdown on equally titanic adversaries. You're more than just a lumbering brute, as you can outfit these beasts with various mods and abilities to broaden your offensive arsenal. The result is a chaotic monster mash that also boasts a sharp look thanks to its comic book-inspired aesthetic.

Rapper Machine Gun Kelly has hopped aboard the hype train for WWE 2K22, severing as an official partner by providing his music and shaping the game's soundtrack. He’s also set to become a playable superstar himself. 
2K has announced that MGK will arrive as part of a post-launch content pack (which has no release date), so don’t expect to do this to him on release day:

Kelly serves as executive producers on 2K22's soundtrack, helping curate its tunes which include the following:
Machine Gun Kelly - "Concert for Aliens"
Machine Gun Kelly ft. Yungblud & Bert McCracken - "Body Bag"
Wu-Tang Clan - "Protect Ya Neck"
Motorhead - "Iron Fist"
Poppy - "Say Cheese" (Live NXT version)
Royal Blood - "Typhoons"
Bring Me The Horizon - "Happy Song"
The Weeknd - "Heartless"
Turnstile - "I Don't Wanna Be Blind"
Asking Alexandria - "The Final Episode (Let's Change the Channel)”
KennyHoopla - "Hollywood Sucks."
I know it seems weird, but Kelly is a known wrestling fan and has made several appearances on WWE programming over the years so the partnership makes sense and must be pretty cool for him. I just want to know what his rating and moveset would be. Also, does this open the door for Bad Bunny to join the roster? Because I would unironically be down for that.
WWE 2K22 arrives March 11 for PlayStation and Xbox consoles and PC. You can view the full list of the confirmed superstars here.]]></summary>

They did it. They did the thing. And it’s awesome. 
If you’ve seen Spider-Man: No Way Home, then you know of its biggest secrets (which is one of the movie industry’s worst-kept secrets): there are three Spider-Mans, err, Spider-Men, in it and accompanying Tom Holland’s Peter Parker is Andrew Garfield and Toby Maguire’s own iteration of the character. In the movie, they kind of allude to the most infamous Spider-Man meme out there – the three Spider-Man pointing at each other, surprised to see other iterations of themselves – but now, Marvel has released a better, official version of it. 
As you can see in the image above, Holland, Maguire, and Garfield perfectly replicated the meme in their own suits and it’s everything we imagined it would be. Plus, it comes alongside news that Spider-Man: No Way Home can be streamed digitally on March 22 before it hits 4K and Blu-ray on April 12. 
After you calm down from the glory that is that image, read about this announcement for Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 from Insomniac Games, and then check out this trailer for Insomniac’s Wolverine game now in development. Read why one Game Informer editor believes this Wolverine needs to occupy the same world as Insomniac’s Spider-Man after that.

Ed Boon has likely been making video games longer than you’ve been alive. Years before he became the steward of the Mortal Kombat franchise, Boon was programming pinball and arcade games for companies that no longer exist. But despite his over 30-year history in the industry, he’s only ever really had one job.
To get a full view of what such a storied career looks like, we talked with Boon about his early days at Williams Electronics, some of the names Mortal Kombat could have had, and what it’s like working on the same series for over two decades.

A Plague Tale: Requiem doesn’t have a release date yet, but that hasn’t stopped publisher Focus Entertainment from unveiling a rather cool Collector’s Edition.
The centerpiece of this bundle, pictured above, is a resin statue of protagonists Amicia and Hugo. Standing 8.3 inches tall, Amicia takes aim with her new crossbow. 
The bundle also includes the following items (none of which are supernatural rats, thankfully):
A Plague Tale: Requiem game with store-exclusive cover art
Collector’s box
45 RPM vinyl (2 tracks)
Hugo’s metal feather brooch (2.4") 
3 A4 lithographs
Additionally, buying the Collector’s Edition gets you the Protector Pack which includes these in-game items:
Red Damsel crossbow skin
Bonus crafting material
13 exclusive cosmetic items for Amicia
The entire package will set you back $189.99 and it’s only available at the Focus Entertainment Store. 
A Plague Tale: Requiem is the sequel to 2019’s A Plague Tale: Innocence. Amicia and Hugo find themselves on another rat-infested journey in search of an island believed to contain a secret for curing Hugo’s curse. The game launches in 2022 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch (cloud version), and PC. You can watch its most recent gameplay trailer from The Game Awards 2021 here and view its latest screenshots here.]]></summary>

Horizon Forbidden West was released this past Friday and after a weekend where likely millions of players began Aloy’s latest journey, Guerrilla Games has released Patch 1.05, the game’s first. 
This patch takes aim at several issues in the game, such as an oversharpening of the screen image when HDR is on, and it fixes dozens of them while also listing out known issues the team is working on. It’s par for the course as far as post-launch patches go but if you’ve held off on playing, Horizon Forbidden West is now an even better game as a result. And if you have been p…]]></summary>

Platinum Games’ Nier: Automata is getting an anime. 
This was revealed by publisher Square Enix during the game’s fifth anniversary livestream today by way of a new teaser trailer that you can watch below. The teaser, which is quite brief clocking in at just 31 seconds, doesn’t reveal too much at all. It showcases what could perhaps be the anime’s animation style, although it could just be concept art of 2B and her Pod companion bot.

As you can see in the trailer above, there’s not too much to glean from it. However, Square Enix released some additional information about it after the fact, revealing that in this anime, humans have left Earth to go to the moon as a result of an overwhelming amount of seemingly dangerous machines on their home planet. 2B, who is playable in Nier: Automata, is sent back down to Earth to help reclaim the planet and if you’re at all familiar with the game, you can probably see where this anime might be heading.
Aniplex, the studio behind anime like Fullmetal Alchemist, is working on this Nier: Automata anime. 
While waiting for this anime to drop, read Game Informer’s Nier: Automata review and then check out this story about the upgrade patch Nier: Automata finally received on Steam after fans have been asking for it for four years. Read Game Informer’s Nier Replicant ver. 1.22474487139 review after that.

"Nothing but grief here", you mark by Bloodborne. "Time for crab", you scribble across each one in a mad frenzy. You are so tired of the crabs. They aren't the most encouraging games, to say the least.
But Elden Ring is different. Yes, it's an action-RPG that retains Souls' difficulty, but it's one that expands their labyrinthine worlds with a single offering that's dizzying in its scope. Perhaps most importantly, it's a world that encourages you to explore and wants you to win, even if its way of showing it is with a massive rock troll that wants to cave your face in. What Elden Ring provides is an adventure unlike anything else or anyone else's. An unmissable jaunt through one of, if not the most impressive open world to date. "Visions of joy" sums it up nicely.

Once in a great while, a game comes along that seamlessly combines impeccable gameplay, a wondrous world, incredible tone-setting music, and unparalleled art direction. That game is From Software’s Elden Ring, an action RPG that channels the best aspects of the studio’s last decade of work into one enormous package. This absurdly ambitious open world captivated my curiosity, enticed me with puzzles, secrets, and mysteries, and served up unbelievably satisfying moments as I experienced one of the most extraordinary adventures of all time.

The ongoing lawsuit from the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) against the company is over reported toxic workplace culture. The bulk of the suit focuses on "violations of the state's civil rights and equal pay laws," specifically regarding the treatment of women and other marginalized groups.

All the T-posed NPCs, floataway physics bugs and crashes-to-desktop would be lost in time, like tears in rain. What remained was the deep appreciation I had for its story and characters, and a longing to revisit Night City.
So I have. After last week's patch 1.5 promised more fixes, a refreshed perk tree and improved AI, I wondered if I might finally be able to champion the first-person RPG without caveats. The answer is not a simple yes or no - but the list of caveats is definitely a lot shorter.

I’ve never eaten at an Olive Garden because a.) we don’t have them in the UK, and b.) unlimited pasta sounds like a death sentence. But I understand it’s viewed as a faux-fancy chain for people who think Al Dente was the name of the man who invented spaghetti, and not somewhere you’d want to earnestly praise as a quote unquote ‘serious critic’.


Big Tones was having none of it. He applauded Hagerty’s celebration of Olive Garden as a genuine expression of widespread American food culture, calling her detractors ‘snarkologists’, and then published a book of her reviews. A class act, no doubt. And it’s this championing of the everyman gourmand, this deep passion for non-exclusionary, unpretentious foodie culture, that powers Total War: Warhammer 3’s most joyfully silly campaign experience.

Update, 2/22/22:
After being suspended for more than two months, the free trial for Final Fantasy XIV is back and open to any and all players. 
The official FFXIV Twitter account announced the news today. For the uninitiated, the free trial was suspended back in December following widespread congestion issues in FFXIV. Those issues occurred as a result of the rapid growth the MMO experienced ahead of its Endwalker expansion launch.

In a live broadcast earlier this week, producer and director Naoki Yoshida outlined future ambitions, including making it possible to play all "main scenario dungeons of A Realm Reborn" with NPC pals instead of other players.

Yoshida also mentioned the game's first planned graphical update, and a partial roadmap of new content to come in future patches.

I still appear to be untold miles away from the cool kind of jungley beachy bits from the promo screenshots. So far, though, I'm having a lot of fun, riding around on my big metal robot cow in its stunning world - a very beautiful game, is this, with lots of lens flare and dripping water and waving grass. A big and interesting world, and I am very much looking forward to playing more and reading insightful criticism and analysis of it. I would also like someone to explain the Pullcaster to me, because it's one thing in Horizon Forbidden West that, as far as I can tell, does not need to exist whatsoever.

Finally, I could live out my dream of sliding down tree branches like Disney's Tarzan, all while playing another gorgeous adventure from the makers of Old Man's Journey and Secrets Of Raetikon. Admittedly, I was surprised when I saw it was going to be part of this week's Steam Next Fest. The developers have said upfront that the game is only around an hour long, and with this week's demo stretching to a generous 20 minutes, part of me's now quite sad that I've already seen a third of it in action. 
The other part of me, however, is absolutely thrilled, and it's all down to my gibbon's sick, speed-boosting backflips.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Know By Heart, the new game from Ice-Pick Lodge, makers of Pathologic, is described as a "sentimental adventure." It's about a group of friends reuniting in their provincial Russian hometown, which is rendered with golden hour lighting and inhabited by soft, faceless characters. But around the edges of the launch trailer there's plenty of signs of Ice-Pick's typical dread and anxiety.

Well, Ubisoft have made their stupid-ass stance on NFTs quite clear, so let's move on to question two. In a recent financial conference call, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot said they think they're good to stand independent, but if someone had a juicy offer, well, they might think about it. But that's a noncommittal business answer, really, just business as usual.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Much to my great shame, I never got round to playing Deathloop at the end of last year. Ironically for a game about a never-ending timeloop, I just never had enough minutes to fit it into my schedule. But! I have been rectifying that this week, and cor, it's a bit good, isn't it? I'm particularly enjoying just letting rip with its big chunky guns when I mess up trying to be all sneaky-like. In my painstaking attempt to do a completely clean, blood-free ghost run in Dishonored 2 all those years ago, I'd sort of forgotten just how powerfully satisfying Arkane Lyon's eye for action really is, and I've been having a lot of fun rediscovering this as I beast my way around Blackreef's four main locations. 
As you'd expect from an Arkane game, each one of these maps is absolutely huge, full of nooks and crannies and secret passageways just itching to be exploited as you try and take down all of its slightly mad Eternalist cult leaders in a single cycle. But the thing I've been most intrigued by in Deathloop so far isn't its weird cubby holes or how maps change over time. It's all those huffing great arcade cabinets littered about the place. And some of them look very familiar indeed...

Stealth and patience are crucial to victory in a world where aliens aren't just shambling meat sacks, but a horrifying hivemind that's best tackled quietly.
But after spending a little hands-on time with Extraction's new game mode Spillover, it seems it  does away with what makes the base game tick. You plant bombs, then fend off hordes of aliens. There's something missing here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dirigo Games impressed former RPS neck honcho Adam Smith with Depths Of Fear, and later added  two excellent games to to The Bundle. Syscrusher was a very brief but smooth and exciting shooter, and Stowaway an atmospheric monster horror. Their new game, Kingdom Of The Dead, combines the two; a striking fast paced FPS about a... paranormal vigilante cowboy, I think? It does not sit you down and explain itself, and I actually kind of like that about it.
You're part of, or possibly all of, a kind of 19th century X Files, except instead of talking and analysing the situation, you already know that the way to deal with undead weirdness is to roll up with your revolver and kick its face in. Interesting as the premise is, it's really about blasting around some fun environments for a few hours, and I've enjoyed it more with every level.

It's not the cold. It's not even the lack of anything to do. It's that when your main threat is starvation and hypothermia, and your only real tool is stockpiling, it often feels like your fate is already sealed come October, and waiting around to see if you survived or not carries the same sense of slow inevitability that the average RTS or 4X game does past the opening act.
My first village in Timberborn gave me that feeling. Even though its dry season is the opposite of Winter, the ultimate effect was the same. I've played this before, I thought. This is the villagers vs winter game again.
I was a fool. A big, wrong fool.

Sadly Matthew, one of our real life bestest pals, couldn't be here this week. Curiously, it's a much more well-behaved podcast than normal, suggesting that actually the chaotic influence was Matthew all along... Still, Nate updates us on his war gaming models, which are slowly becoming a diorama and/or dolls' house. I also tell him about the final third of a film about an aquarium where all the fish become zombies, called Aquarium Of The Dead. It is not a good film.

So the expansion will come to Russia too, but EA are delaying the launch one week so they can get their ducks in a line and launch simultaneously worldwide.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Almost six years after the historical strategy action of Total War crashed into Games Workshop's wacky fantasy world of Warhammer, the trilogy wraps up today with Total War: Warhammer 3. Oh I'm sure expansions will follow, and the game-joining Mortal Empires campaign is still to come, but Total Warhammer 3 is here now. Sadly, the launch is somewhat blighted by many players suffering serious performance problems.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There’s an old chestnut from gaming mythology - you surely know the one - about the movement in Mario’s 3D ventures being perfected by Shigeru Miyamoto at their very start with Super Mario 64. Core Design managed the same thing with the original Tomb Raider back in 1996, too. Nobody really talks about it now, while the Mario story endures. Possibly because Nintendo didn’t make umpteen identikit sequels over the following decade or splash Mario’s stretchy mug on the cover of The Face. 
Really though, the Italian plumber and English graverobber were equally confident that if all their moves were available right from the start with no unlocking needed then that was enough. Both games were – are still, after a quarter of a century – the Platonic ideal of their characters. And they had bloody good swimming sections.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Skateboarding sim Session has added a lot in the past two years, but also lost some of its ragdoll charm. Since last year's total physics overhaul, you no longer bail with every failed trick, instead teleporting off your board in a strange, stiff way that saves time but (for me at least) replaces one unrealistic motion with another, less funny one. I want to get that gripe out of the way, because otherwise it's still gunning to be the sim for darksliding anoraks. 
The next update will add two new areas, which I got to try out recently, and some new pro skater faces. If you can ignore the frequent wacky physics hiccups and the rigid, nonplussed reaction your character has when they should, by all rights, be landing flat on their face, you'll find a surprisingly chill skating game. It's less about hoarding points with as many tricks as possible and more about pushing languidly around a city as viewed through a seasoned kickflipper's fisheye goggles.

The studio are named Rebel Wolves, and they're founded by Konrad Tomaszkiewicz, who was director of The Witcher 3 and secondary game director on Cyberpunk 2077. Their RPG is largely a mystery for now, though a wee bit of artwork suggests at least one vampire is involved?

Having originally begun life on mobile devices back in 2013, this combat-free space exploration and resource management game arrived on PC two years later as part of a snazzed up Ω Edition, putting you in the shoes of a lone astronaut trying to survive on the fringes of deep space. It was also bloody difficult, with a punishing brutality lying beneath its serene and comforting surface - something that developer Mi-Clos Studio's founder and creative director Michaël Peiffert has been keen to address with its upcoming sequel, Out There: Oceans Of Time.

But Update 1.5 might be bad news for players with older PCs. CD Projekt Red have officially ended support for Nvidia GeForce 700 series graphics cards, and announced plans to end Windows 7 support later this year. This isn't immediately bad, but the game could end up breaking on affected computers in the future.

He seemed weary, but livened up as I picked through some beige.
Eventually I decided on corn, a warm yellow to keep things light and breezy. To both my relief and, I think, the relief of the Carpet Man, it wasn't grey. The shade that, for whatever reason, most people like to walk on. One that tires Carpet Man and reminds me of Lost Ark, an MMO that's supremely popular for some reason. No matter how chic it may be right now, I can't see it being a permanent fixture in my life.

One, "Network Extensions 3", violates the Steam Subscriber Agreement by "discriminating against specific Steam users" blocking them from using it, Colossal Order say. Another mod, "Update From Github", aimed to circumvent the Steam Workshop entirely by allowing updates to mods to be installed directly form Github while "making changes to existing Workshop subscriptions without the user's knowledge."

Complicating matters somewhat is a sea of rumours about what else the mods contained, and a series of counter-allegations about Colossal Order from the creator of the mods.
