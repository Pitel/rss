        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Almost 20 million units sold.
Nintendo has announced that The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom has now sold 19.50 million units, just shy of that 20 million milestone.
Launched on May 12th, 2023, the game has now effectively sold nearly two-thirds of what Breath of the Wild has managed in the space of about five months or so. That's insane. For the sake of clarity, Breath of the Wild is now sitting at 31.15 million units.

Nintendo has today shared its latest financial report for FY2024 and this gives us an updated list of the best-selling Switch games as of 30th September 2023.
Unlike the last report, which saw The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom sneak into the proceedings, this quarter remains relatively unchanged. In fact, all of the titles have managed to hold onto the same positions as we saw back in August, with the number of units sold ever rising.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over 50% of which in Japan.
As part of Nintendo's latest financial report, which tracks the second quarter of the fiscal year ending March '24 (that's April 1st to September 30th, 2023 specifically), the company has announced that Pikmin 4 has sold 2.62 million units since its release on July 21st, 2023.
The milestone puts the game ahead of Pikmin 3 Deluxe which, as of December 2022, had sold a total of 2.4 million units (though it's reasonable to assume Pikmin 3 has managed more since then). To manage such a feat in just a little over two months is quite remarkable.

Nintendo has published its six-month financial report for FY2024 and, as per usual, has also reconfirmed release dates for its upcoming games.
Now including the Mario vs. Donkey Kong remake, there are no big surprises in this list of "Primary Nintendo Products," but Metroid Prime 4 fans may take heart in the fact that the game remains on the Switch roster as a "TBA" entry, the same place it's been for the last four years.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo just announced a brand new bundle for the Switch OLED that isn’t simply another Mario Kart package. The bundle goes on sale November 19, just in time for Black Friday shopping.


The new Switch OLED includes Super Smash Bros. Ultimate via digital download and three months of Nintendo Switch Online. The Black Friday deal runs at $349.99, saving you about $67.98 — around the cost of a new game if you're looking to add more to the pile. 


If the OLED model isn't what you're looking for, Nintendo's also got deals on the Switch Lite. Two new Animal Crossing bundles join the console lineup in time for the holiday season, including a pink Isabelle Aloha Edition and a turquoise Timmy and Tommy Aloha Edition. Isabelle's bundle is a Shopper's Drug Mart exclusive, while Timmy and Tommy editions are only available at Walmart. Both are $259.96.


Nintendo's Black Friday deals include more than a system bundle, too. Price cuts on games include $25 off The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Luigi's Mansion 3, Xenoblade Chronicles 3, and Kirby's Return to Dream Land Deluxe. You can grab some older heavy hitters for $30 off, including Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes, Super Mario Odyssey, and Metroid Dread. 


With holiday shopping deals revving up for Black Friday, Nintendo has its full list of offers up on its official hub. If you're among those just itching to dive into Super Mario RPG though, that's a sale for a Nintendo sometime in the far, far future. Aside from a few pre-order bonuses, you're stuck paying full price and maybe reading our hands-on experience with the remake while you wait.

Spike Chunsoft came through with some fresh details for Shiren the Wanderer: The Mystery Dungeon of Serpentcoil Island. In addition to some quality of life updates to exploration, the latest rougelike is looking to make livestreaming even more convenient with an enhanced Live Display Mode. 


The updated display presents an abundance of information on a single screen, in both standard and simplified views. This makes it ideal for streaming, as the display shows everything from play time to turns, weapon and shield strength, and the player's current status. Here's a sample of how the standard Live Display Mode view looks:

PlayStation Twitter support ends soon


"As of November 13, 2023, integration with X (formerly known as Twitter) will no longer function on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 consoles," says PlayStation on its official website. "This includes the ability to view any content published on X on PS5/PS4, and the ability to post and view content, trophies, and other gameplay-related activities on X directly from PS5/PS4 (or link an X account to do so)."


This means it won't be quite so easy to post photos of Spider-Man swinging across New York or Kratos taking out a giant foe in God of War Ragnarok. You can still do post shots on the platform, but only through the PlayStation App or by offloading and uploading photos manually.


PlayStation has not provided further reason for this decision. Changes have been rolling out for the API, and Sony isn't the only one that's shut down its direct integration—Microsoft turned off its Xbox-to-Twitter sharing earlier this year.


To make matters worse, the X CEO posted shoddy, blurry gameplay footage of Diablo 4 with an off-screen camera on the same day as this announcement. It shows him defeating Lillith in the worst way possible. Perhaps using the Share function would be a better way to share this epic moment.

Navia was first introduced in the Fontaine teaser trailer and has had a presence in the Fontaine Archon Quests. Now it appears she’s making the leap from NPC to playable character. She’s a Geo character with an Ousia Arkhe. From her presence in the teaser trailer, we can reasonably guess that she will be a 5-star character. Other than that though, her character introduction doesn’t include many new details. It looks like we’ll have to wait patiently for the leader of Spina di Rosula to become playable.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[November 6 is Stranger Things Day. Canonically, this is the date that season one of the Netflix show opens on. It's a big deal for die hard fans of the show, and Behaviour Interactive figures it's as good a reason as any for another Dead by Daylight and Stranger Things crossover. 


It was August 2019 that the first collaboration occurred between Dead by Daylight and Stranger Things. Known a the Stranger Things Chapter, it consisted of two new survivors, a new killer, a new map, and a batch of cosmetics. It quickly became a fan favorite amongst the Dead by Daylight audience. And now, like a horror villain that just won't die, it's back.




The new killer added to the survival game was the infamous, and horrific, Demogorgon. Much like in the show, it was terrifying to see it scurry around the map and lunge at the survivors with its gaping maw and vicious claws. It also has the ability to move around Hawkins National Laboratory via portals which added to both its versatility and potential for jump scares. 


The two survivors added to the game were Nancy Wheeler and Steve Harrington. The duo were playable on a new map within the Stranger Things Chapter, the Hawkins National Laboratory: Undergound Complex. As you can see in the above trailer, it has a sinister and ominous feel to its halls. A perfect replication of what fans experience when viewing the show. 


In addition to the survivors, killer, and map, all of the prior cosmetics will be making their return to the Dead by Daylight in-game store. The Jonathan Byers outfit is an alternative skin that can be applied. As well as Steve's Scoops Ahoy outfit from season two. 


All of the Stranger Things Chapter content is available now in Dead by Daylight. Behaviour Interactive didn't specify how long the DLC would be available. So if you're interested in running through the depths of Hawkins as one of the show's heroes, pick it up while you can.

The post Stranger Things is returning to Dead by Daylight appeared first on Destructoid.]]></summary>

The Build Engine may not get as much attention as the splinters from the Doom Engine, but it was, out of the box, a pretty great 2.5D ray-casting engine. It became best known for being the foundation of Duke Nukem 3D, but it was also used for a number of less notable games. Duke Nukem 3D came bundled with a suite of editing tools, so a strong modding community sprang up around it.


Unfortunately, Extreme Paintbrawl came out during a very awkward time in terms of compatibility. That is to say, it was during that point when Microsoft was trying to bury DOS under Windows, which is, anecdotally,…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlayStation integration with X (formerly known as Twitter) is ending for PS5 and PS4 next week via a new update. That means users will no longer be able to directly upload screenshots and video clips from the console to the social media site.
An announcement update posted to the PlayStation Support page states that on Monday, November 13, X integration will end, which includes the ability to “view any content published on X on PS5/PS4, and the ability to post and view content, trophies, and other gameplay-related activities on X directly from PS5/PS4 (or link an X account to do so).”
While a bummer for those who make frequent use of this feature, which offers a simple method of posting gameplay content to the platform, there are a couple of more involved alternatives depending on your platform. If you’re a PS5 user, you can still use the PlayStation mobile app to upload gameplay captures to then post on X. You can read how to do that here. PS4 users have to rely on ShareFactory and do a bit more work, and you can read those steps here.
Microsoft made the same move in April by disabling sharing to X directly from the console and instructing players to instead use the Xbox app on mobile (with some speculating the decision was made to avoid paying the platform's then-new monthly application programming interface (API) fee). This now means that the Switch will become the sole console that supports direct media sharing to X. 
What do you think about the decision to end X integration? Did you use this feature regularly? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blizzard Entertainment has revealed that the first expansion for Diablo IV is called Vessel of Hatred, and it hits the game late next year. The Diablo team revealed this news over the weekend during BlizzCon 2023, which is also where we learned about three new World of Warcraft expansions and three new Overwatch 2 heroes coming to the game. 
During BlizzCon 2023, Blizzard kept Vessel of Hatred details light, stating it will share more details next summer. As for what to expect, it features a campaign that continues the dark tale that began in Diablo IV. "Vessel of Hatred brings players back to learn the fate of the prime evil Mephisto and his demonic plans for Sanctuary," a press release reads. "Travel to the lush jungles known by the locals as Nahantu." 
Check out the Diablo IV: Vessel of Hatred expansion announcement trailer for yourself below: 


Blizzard says Vessel of Hatred will allow players to traverse an exotic new region, vanquish new evils, and perhaps most excitingly, explore fresh ways to kill demons and loot chests with a completely new Class "never seen before in the Diablo universe." 
And that's all Blizzard shared about Vessel of Hatred. Diablo IV's first expansion is due out in late 2024. 
For more about the game, read Game Informer's Diablo IV review and then check out this story about how Diablo IV (and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III) won't be coming to Xbox Game Pass this year, even though Xbox now owns Activision Blizzard. Read about the ongoing Diablo IV Season of Blood after that.

"Even as a frequent spender," they said, "lots of stuff simply isn't worth the price [anymore]."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blizzard Entertainment has revealed the next three heroes of Overwatch 2, including Mauga, a new duel-wielding tank hero that hits the game next month. Plus, the Overwatch 2 team teased a new DPS hero and Support hero hitting the roster sometime down the line. 
Mauga was actually playable for free as a part of a limited-time trial run for the tank hero this past weekend, but he's already out of the game; his real debut happens alongside Overwatch 2's Season 8 launch on December 5. "Equipped with two chain guns (Gunny and Cha-Cha), Mauga is ready to bash through the front lines of his opponents and tear through anyone that stands in his way with tons of fire-power," Blizzard says about the hero. 
Watch the official Mauga gameplay trailer below: 


Here are some additional Mauga screens from Overwatch 2: 

Elsewhere during the Overwatch 2 BlizzCon 2023 presentation, which is where Mauga was revealed, Blizzard pulled back the curtains on two more heroes coming to the game sometime in the future. The first is a DPS hero named Venture, with a unique Splatoon-ish weapon: 
The second is a new support hero codenamed Space Ranger, and given this hero does not yet have an official title, it's the hero we're expecting to debut in Overwatch 2 last out of these new ones. 
The final piece of Overwatch 2 from BlizzCon 2023 is Clash, a new PvP mode where two teams are tasked with capturing five distinct points on a map. Perhaps most excitingly, Blizzard is bringing back Overwatch map Hanamura as playable in Clash, except under the new name Hanaoka. Here's a look at Hanaoka below: 
For more about BlizzCon 2023, read about the three World of Warcraft expansions announced during the event. After that, read Game Informer's Overwatch 2 review, and then check out our Diablo IV review.

This "multi-year co-development partnership" will "build a powerful toolkit that harnesses artificial intelligence to enrich the narrative and character creation elements of game development", according to Inworld CEO Ilya Gelfenbeyn. You might recognise Inworld as the tech used by that GTA 5 mod about AI cultists in which characters speak AI-generated dialogue, which Rockstar blocked from distribution over the summer. Suffice to say that Microsoft have grander plans for it.

        <updated>2023-11-06T17:30:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I reviewed Hunt: Showdown for a different parish back in 2019, it was a swampy, stealthy, slow-paced extraction FPS that consisted of weaving through mouldy undead and pockets of inconveniently noisy wildlife, ears pricked for the rustle of a rival player in the bushes. It was a game in which every footfall felt like a gamble and every second lasted an eternity, even before you entered the lair of a giant spider. Fast  forward to 2023, and streamers are playing Hunt: Showdown like it's Titanfall 2, scurrying along walls with scant regard for the NPC cannon fodder below, duelling each other on rooftops with pistol shotguns, and tearing through those poor, befuddled boss monsters like sandcastles.


Thus the fate of any competitive shooter lucky enough to acquire a seasoned pro following, I guess. But still, returning to Crytek's PvPvE shooter has been a shock, and speaking to the development team, it sounds like the devs themselves have been struggling to keep up with the more ambitious players, too. Showdown was never expected to endure quite this long and evolve in quite this way, according to general manager David Fifield, and managing the community's ambitions for the game is as much of a challenge as compensating for the limitations of its ageing engine.

The strange pointy-headed revenant may end up being explained away in Bloober Team's remake of Silent Hill 2, however, if Best Buy's store listing is anything to go by.


As spotted by Twitter user bobvids, Best Buy's Silent Hill 2 remake store page claims that the "fan favourite character, Pyramid Head, makes a return along with a special origin story for fans to play through." Obviously, a mere store listing isn't going to go into any meaningful depth on the nitty-gritty of its claims, but this was more than enough to worry Silent Hill fans such as bobvids himself.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Red Shoes.
Fairy tales are never really what they seem. Growing up, we’re all exposed to these moral stories – often based on fable and myth – which have been adapted multiple times and, in many cases, softened too, whether it’s through a beautifully drawn picture book or a sanitised Disney adaptation. But as you get older and more curious, you start to peel back the layers of these cutesy tales and often find more sinister origins lurking beneath
Little Goody Two Shoes is the embodiment of this notion. You play as Elise, a young girl whose grandmother has just passed away. Elise wants more in life – she wants to go from rags to riches, but she spends her days being a “little goody two shoes” by helping out the people of Kieferberg. But after meeting a new friend and finding a pair of red shoes in her back garden, Elise’s wish seems much closer than she ever dreamed. It’s a fascinating tale, one that works when it plays to its strengths, though some frustrations are holding it back.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Xbox has had a busy year which involved the release of Starfield and the finalization of the acquisition of Activision Blizzard. 


In a recent interview with Famitsu, Xbox CEO Phil Spencer spoke a little about the future of Microsoft's gaming platform. He also divulged some information about his personal gaming habits, which might be surprising to some. Though you may expect Specer to be glued to his Xbox, he loves his ASUS ROG Ally. 


He claims that the handheld gaming device is useful for him, as he travels a lot. Interestingly, he refers to it as a kind of Xbox, as it allows him to use Game Pass, and he plays Starfield and Lies of P on it. He also feels the same way about the Steam Deck, which he also jokingly refers to as an Xbox. 


Spencer's viewpoint does reflect a strategy that the company has laid out. As he has previously stated, he wants Game Pass to "come to every device," allowing millions of players around the world to build an Xbox gaming library without investing in a console.

Expanding the Xbox family


During the interview, Spencer gave some insight into the future of the gaming industry and how his company intends to respond to the constant changes. He highlights how there is a growing PC and mobile gaming market in Japan, and how Xbox has been benefitting from this. He claims the brand has been embraced by the Japanese market across multiple platforms. 


Through Game Pass and cloud gaming, the Xbox family has expanded and enabled players on a variety of platforms to enjoy the ecosystem. Because of this, Spencer highlights how it is necessary to consider Nintendo and PlayStation players to be part of the Xbox community as well. 


There are interesting times ahead for Microsoft's gaming division. According to leaks, we may be getting a diskless Xbox Series X redesign, and the next generation could be coming our way in 2028.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the major draws of Starfield is the ability to pilot your own spaceship. However, the downside to this is having to trek all the way back to where you parked your ship before you can fly it. Fortunately, someone has solved this little problem.


Say hello to "Summoning of Ship," a mod for Starfield made by user wSkeever that allows you to call your vessel to your position without being near it. With a remote control added to your inventory, you can command your spaceship to take off into orbit and tell it to land.




The above video shows it in action. While the spaceship can be called remotely, you'll need to make sure you're near some flat ground. Additionally, you can set it to land on an empty landing pad when you're in a city that has one.


So many mods, so little time


Even before Starfield came out, people were creating and releasing their own custom mods for the game. Everything from making Earth habitable again to adding in the Daleks from Doctor Who have come out the woodwork.


Bethesda's newest IP has a lot going for it by itself, but the vanilla experience can only take you so far. The modding community can not only bring new elements that the original studio didn't implement, but also make the game better in general.


That said, Bethesda is seeing to it that Starfield remains in good shape too. For instance, it was recently announced that the game will be getting DLSS support this week. So that's something to look forward to if you're running an Nvidia graphics card.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello folks. A small bit of RPS Game Club news today. Since it's starting to get toward end of the year season, Game Club will be taking a short break for the next two months. That means we won't be running it this month (November), or next month (December). We will, however, be returning with a fresh set of monthly game selections in 2024, so you can look forward to more group play-a-longs and liveblog chats early next year.
In the meantime, though, we hope you've enjoyed this first year's outing of the RPS Game Club, and we'd love to get some feedback on it for how we can improve next year. Regardless of whether you're a regular Game Clubber or have only ever watched it from afar, please come and join in the discussion below to help us make it even better.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new Dragon Quest Monsters game is right around the corner with the upcoming launch of Dragon Quest Monsters: The Dark Prince. Ahead of that, Square Enix has detailed the monster-battler's online features.


The Dark Prince marks the return of PvP modes from past Dragon Quest Monsters games alongside some new twists. For instance, players can take part in Quickfire Contests, which use your party data to initiate automatic battles. Once your data is registered you can take part in competitions that pull the data of 30 players for lightning-fast showdowns. You can earn Quickfire Contest rewards — including stat-raising items for your monsters — once per day.


Meanwhile, those who dominate in online competitions can take their winnings to the new Online Shop. Here you can buy items that will help you further strengthen your squad. Chief among the prizes are scrolls, which will teach a new Talent to one of your monsters. Stock is updated every real-world day, so you'll have to keep checking back if you have your heart (and gold) set on something specific.

Battle ready


Online battles will be available in the usual flavors. There are Friend Matches for low-stakes competition and Ranked Matches for those vying to be the very best. There are also Multiplayer Tournaments that let up to eight players throw down knockout style. There's plenty of incentive for going ranked, including the promise of powerful items and rare accessories. 


It's worth noting that Fizzy, pictured below, is who you'll need to talk to if you want to go online. Honestly, I just wanted an excuse to post this delightful apple-clutching piece of art.

If Dragon Quest Monsters: The Dark Prince sounds like your competitive cup of slime-filled tea, it hits Nintendo Switch on December 1, 2023.

One of the early replies was an "ummm actually," pointing out that you had to be 21 to buy booze in most states, and Thomas Violence responded "I'm one of the dozens of people worldwide that live in a country that's not America". I am reminded of this tweet a lot, and I am reminded of it whenever I log on to Puzzmo, a new daily browser-based puzzle service from Orta Therox and Zach "Zach Gage" Gage.
Puzzmo is great, and currently in a sort of gradually expanding beta where you can sign up to get a chance to be sent a log-in, or existing users can give two friends a log-in (I have used mine already, sorry). Every day you get a few different puzzles, with a subscription model offering bonus puzzles. I've not subbed because I'm just not built for anagram puzzles and I do not understand chess, which form about half of the daily offering, but I enjoy doing the daily fliparts and crosswords a lot. Except. The crosswords always have clues that are very specific to the USA.

The Finals is a multiplayer shooter that seems to take place entirely at this elevated pitch. In the dozens of open beta matches I've played, the result is as thrilling as those other games, but also exhausting. I wish it would chill for just a moment so I could fully enjoy its delights - of which there are many.

Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name mostly takes place concurrent to Yakuza: Like a Dragon, a game that saw RGG Studio tackle RPG ideas with a new hero in the lead. And though we’re back to brawler basics here with Kiryu in Gaiden, there’s enough here to make it a valuable excursion for the long-time fans.

As far as pitches go, Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name, the next game in what used to be called the Yakuza series, is hard to beat: Find out what happened to series protagonist Kiryu Kazuma between Yakuza 6: The Song of Life and Yakuza: Like a Dragon. The former ended with Kiryu faking his death to keep his adopted family of orphans safe. The idea was his story was over – he was moving on to the next chapter of his life.

In the most recent episode of Digital Foundry, we get an analysis of Alan Wake 2, with particular reference to its use of ray tracing (RT) and path tracing (PT). Side-by-side comparisons really demonstrate just how effective algorithmic-based tweaks can improve the look of a video game.




For example, we can see that without ray tracing, small details are lost, such as sharp shadows, accurate reflections, and some general degradation in global illumination. We can then see that with RT and PT on, there's a noticeable difference in visual acuity.

        <updated>2023-11-06T14:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this year, we spent time with tha ltd. and Enhance Experience, the creative teams behind Humanity, for a documentary on the game's development.
While, on its surface, Humanity is a puzzle game about leading groups of people to a goal, as its name implies, its story wrestles with ideas of what it means to be human, the nature of groups, and why we always seem to resort to violence. Humanity's story reflects real-world events, showing us the paths we're currently on.
Watch The Documentary:


"Soon after we began making Humanity, a number of big events and movements broke out around the world," Enhance founder and CEO Tetsuya Mizuguchi tells us. "There were human rights movements, the Hong Kong protests, [and] then there was the pandemic. And war soon followed in Ukraine. We had no idea how quickly and deeply AI would infiltrate our society either. I think all these things found their way into the core of Humanity. That question, for example, 'What is humanity? What is human nature?' We would often talk about how people, looked at individually, are good. There are so many wonderful people out there. But when they become a group, or a nation, or even just big groups, at that level, something happens. It's like a different switch gets flipped. And what you see there, that is what we're trying to depict in Humanity."
Watch above or over on Game Informer's YouTube channel to see the full documentary about the making of Humanity. "Violence Is Inevitable" speaks to the core creative team, including Mizuguchi and tha creative director Yugo Nakamura, about the project's origins, its complications and lengthy development cycle, and how it came to show us the nature of humanity.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Epic Games launched Fortnite Battle Royale in 2017 and if you followed the game back then, you likely know that every other week, there was news that Fortnite had its biggest day ever in terms of player count and other impressive metrics. Now, more than six years later, Fortnite has had its biggest day ever again, bringing in 44.7 million players and 102 million hours of play on Saturday, November 4. 
Epic Games tweeted this record over the weekend, calling it the biggest day in Fortnite's history before thanking Fortnite and OG players.
Way to start things off with a big bang 💥
#FortniteOG. Yesterday was the biggest day in Fortnite’s history with over 44.7 MILLION players jumping in and 102 MILLION hours of play.
November 5, 2023
As for why, Epic doesn't list a specific reason but it's pretty clear it's because of the new season itself. Dubbed Season OG, a short one-month-long season of Fortnite brings players back to the Chapter 1 map for some throwback battle royale nostalgia. Plus, near-weekly updates will take players on a journey from Chapter 1: Season 5 all the way to Chapter 1: Season X. 
Check out Game Informer's breakdown of everything you need to know about Fortnite's Season OG. After that, check out the first official throwback teaser Epic released and then watch this nostalgic Tilted Towers video.

Yes, Halloween has come and gone, the days are getting shorter and colder, and Mariah Carey has poked her head out of the woodwork to remind everyone of that Christmas song she did that one time. More importantly, though, there are games coming out this month, and some ruddy good ones too, so we reckon it's about time we highlight a few of them for your convenience.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Like we did last summer.
Back in 2010, the Wii's Sin & Punishment: Star Successor inadvertently informed how, in various ways, the Space Harrier model could be revitalised in a contemporary fashion. In Air Twister, director Yu Suzuki, famous for creating Space Harrier, Out Run, and After Burner (not to mention Shenmue), doesn’t attempt anywhere near as many shakeups. Rather, it stays conventionally close to the original formula and functionality of Space Harrier, while housed in a modern graphical shell.
Originally designed and released on Apple's iOS in 2022, Air Twister lends itself better to an analog stick and monitor than it does a thumb-obscured touchscreen. Playing as Princess Arch, you tour fantastical worlds, on rails, while either tapping for direct, stronger fire, or tracing over enemies for a lock-on reticle and a homing volley. Both shot types share the same button, so you simply have to stop tapping for the homing property to take effect. As pure an arcade experience as one could wish for, you avoid incoming fire, gun down as many enemies as possible, and then take out an end-of-level boss.

I score this a 7/10 on the Hoot And/Or Holler scale.

Admittedly, we never dug the original Alien Hominid. First released on consoles in 2004, it had its fanbase, sure, but the Newgrounds art style, slack animation response, and aggravating rather than enjoyable difficulty curve just turned us off.
Enter Alien Hominid Invasion, a 2023 sequel that blasted out of nowhere, ready to appeal to existing fans, wherever they may be, and hopefully tractor-beam in some new ones. And, the change in direction and the overall execution of this sequel is pleasantly surprising. It no longer follows the typical run-and-gun format of the original, but instead goes for a multi-path map crawl, where stages act like giant arenas, and within those stages you’re tasked with fulfilling a series of mini-missions dished out at random.

Beginning back in 2015, io games made a huge debut and were some of the most popular titles on the market all the way through 2018, with even PewDiePie once declaring an io game to be his "new favorite game." Now that’s some popularity.


Nowadays, there are still loads of active io games for players to enjoy or just try out. There are way too many to list, but there are a few that are worth checking out. Here are the five best io games you can play right now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["I am a horror maniac who prefers to stay at home".
These days, it feels like every other indie game released is a roguelite of some kind, and while there are a lot of good ideas brought to the table, the barrage of releases can feel like they start to blend together. Not so with World of Horror. This is a roguelite RPG styled after the basic adventure games of the early ‘80s, which means that it’s only a step or two away from being entirely text-based. This approach tends to work in its favor, and while World of Horror may seem archaic by modern standards, there’s a complex, difficult, and compelling game to explore here for those who stick with it.
A typical run will see you attempting to solve five self-contained ‘mysteries’ consecutively, surviving the trials of each one by managing your resources carefully, much like a survival horror. Each mystery only takes about ten minutes to complete, and the plotline is progressed by selecting various locales—such as a forest or a mansion—and investigating them, triggering random events that usually give you a choice of a few actions to take. Sometimes you’ll need a specific perk or skill from leveling up to select some of these options, but regardless of your choice, a stat check is pulled that’ll roll an invisible dice and determine success or failure based on the relevant stat.

It's time for another edition of Box Art Brawl, are you ready to judge a game by its cover(s)?
Before we dive into the proceedings of today's match-up, let's check out what happened last time. It was a good old one-on-one duel for The Lion King on the SNES, with Europe and North America going head-to-head. After you lovely lot submitted your votes, it came out pretty close, though Europe just edged it with 56% of the vote compared to NA's 44% — hey, that's (the circle of) life.

What's clear is that it was interesting, both as an early example of an open-world RPG and as an infamously broken example of Eurojank. Now it's getting a re-release in just ten days and I'm fascinated to know whether a Boiling Point with fewer bugs has anything to offer the world in 2023.

During Blizzcon, a press conference that is primarily about games made out of electricity and crying (I assume that is what video games are made from), Blizzard announced that two new forms of Diablo are being unleashed on the world. 


Fans of the series can now look forward to a roleplaying game that will be inspired by Diablo IV and will allow them to explore Sanctuary in a whole new way. It is expected to be released at Blizzcon 2024. On top of that, we will also be able to get our hands on Diablo: The Board Game sometime in 2025.

Then, at my behest, all my friends started reading it one after the other until the anime adaptation was announced. Needless to say, I felt absolutely vindicated. I had made a judgment call on a manga, and the world was now taking notice. The anime was produced by an offshoot of A-1 Pictures, CloverWorks, and while this wasn’t their first rodeo, it was one of the first shows I’d seen from the studio.

As it turns out, the depths of its library are pretty murky. I had not heard of 1993’s Mazin Saga: Mutant Fighter. In fact, if I had heard of it, I probably wouldn’t have been interested in playing it. And that would have been a shame. I would never know what an interesting game it is. On the other hand, my pride would still be intact.

"The objective is to run over babies in your minivan while shooting cops and other players. It's taking over the dark web... and IRL."
You don't need me to tell you that fake video games appearing in TV shows and movies are typically absurd and terrible. But just because something is bad, doesn't mean it's uninteresting. Having watched dozens of movies and episodes with fake video games, I'm going to celebrate a few over the coming weeks. Some daft fake games have neat ideas, some shows portray their fake games in an interesting way, and some fake games are even quite good. Let's start now with Deadware, an unknown horror movie which does a great job recreating something a bit bad: a spOooky haunted browser game from 1999.

The demo kicks off with a conversation between a few silhouettes, and the dialogue sounds like it’s pulled from Killer7. They’re talking about the sun getting bigger.


You’re then dropped on the beach in front of a surreal, upscale resort. After a quick look around, you head inside and get inundated with insults and demands from the posh clientele.

Metzen described the Worldsoul Saga as an epic three-part adventure in the World of Warcraft. Each expansion will have its own features and narrative.

This year's ceremony certainly had a big ring of roping old fans back into the fold. But the star of the show was certainly World of Warcraft, which saw the reveal of a Classic Cataclysm and a new structure for its story and expansions moving forward, under the Worldsoul Saga moniker.


Here's everything Blizzard announced at the BlizzCon 2023 Opening Ceremony.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Even though Warcraft Rumble just released today, or yesterday for some regions, its first Season is already under way. The first season focuses on a new playable leader, Sylvanas Windrunner. Players will be able to add Sylvanas to their collection of Leaders via the Guild Warchest, PvP, or via the store. She will also be added to the G.R.I.D. at the start of Season 2.




Sylvanas seems like a pretty interesting Leader, having played Warcraft Rumble just a little bit. Here are her base abilities and talents:


Abilities



Bowshot: Baseline attack is a ranged, single target, physical damage.


Haunt: On death, Sylvanas summons a Banshee unit which operates just like a normal Banshee.


Leader Ability: Windrunner Warchief (Passive): Horde and Undead minis near Sylvanas gain a movement speed boost.



Talents



Black Arrow: Pierce through enemies in a line, dealing Elemental damage.


Banshee's Wail: Scream on Death, Stunning nearby enemies for 3 seconds.


Forsaken Fury: Horde and Undead near Sylvanas gain Fury.



Blizzard seems pretty invested in Warcraft Rumble, and honestly, from what I've played, it's pretty fun. It's cool to see it launching with a new season...I'm excited to see what other Leaders we'll see in the future.

World of Warcraft Cataclysm Classic is coming in 2024 with "feedback" in tow


WoW: Classic, the "what's old is new again" re-release of older expansions, is moving beyond Wrath of the Lich King in the next year. As was the case with prior WoW Classic updates, Cataclysm Classic will not be a 1:1 recreation of the original expansion that debuted in 2010.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During BlizzCon 2023, Blizzard revealed the first expansion for Diablo 4 titled Vessel of Hatred. Details were sparse, but the expansion will focus on Mephisto, one of the three Prime Evils. The expansion will take place in the Jungles of Torajan and feature a brand new class.




According to Blizzard the expansion is still early on in development and more information will be available in Summer 2024. No firm release date was provided, but the brief trailer revealed a timeframe of Late 2024.


Timing wise it makes sense, as Blizzard confirmed earlier this year that Diablo 4 will receive annual expansions alongside its quarterly seasons. This likely means we will have another two or even three seasons before the Vessel of Hatred expansion releases.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[BlizzCon 2023 is less than 30 minutes away, but Overwatch 2 fans won't have to wait to get a glimpse of the next hero coming to the shooter. Fans over at the /r/Overwatch/ reddit noticed an ad on the Nintendo Switch News tab indicating the upcoming hero, Mauga, will be available for a free trial weekend.


/u/Ready2Rumbl3 on Reddit


The beefy hero Mauga wields dual chainguns to shred his enemies. Mauga will join Overwatch 2 as part of Season 8 which releases on December 5.


Chances are Blizzcon will officially announce Mauga when BlizzCon 2023 kicks off, and it appears the hero will be playable via a trial weekend ahead of his release.




UPDATE: As expect, Mauga has been confirmed as the new hero at BlizzCon 2023. Mauga will dualwield chainguns he named Gunny and Cha-Cha, as he mows through front-lines. Abilities appear to be:



Incendiary Chaingun — Ignites enemies.


Volatile Chaingun — Crits burning enemies.


Overrun — Unstoppable charge.


Cardiac Overdrive — Damages enemies while Mauga gains life.


Cage Fight — Infinite ammunition



As previously mentioned, Mauga will indeed release in Overwatch 2 on all platforms on December 5.

Announced on Thursday, game director and chief producer Katsuhiro Harada added context for the character on social media.


"Victor is actually the first French fighter for the TEKKEN franchise," said Harada. "I have had the idea of a French character in my mind for a long time and it finally came to fruition. Thanks to Vincent Cassel for inspiring me and for voicing him. And the stage is Paris itself, where I took my first Seine River cruise over 20 years ago."




Oui, oui, oui! 


As Harada noted, Chevalier is voiced by French actor Vincent Cassel (Black Swan, La Haine). Victor Chevalier uses a blade, knife, and pistol as his weaponry. He also t…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We're all very much familiar with the rocky star Cyberpunk 2077 had when it launched nearly three years ago. Fortunately, CD Projekt Red has been able to turn things around, and the studio wants the game to have a successful evolution going forward.


According to a recent interview with PC Gamer, narrative director for CDPR Igor Sarzyński hopes Cyberpunk will enjoy a "similar evolution" to the Witcher series. By this, they're referring to the significant ways each subsequent entry changed for the better.




What that means going forward, we can't be certain. However, with the developer now working on the follow-up to Cyberpunk 2077, the team will no doubt be taking on-board lessons learned for both this and the new Witcher saga that's currently in development.


A mended reputation.


Despite the differences between the two IPs, CD Projekt Red were able to (eventually) pull off a successful RPG in something more futuristic than The Witcher. There were certainly new things for the developer to learn, and Sarzyński explains that while some aspects worked "out of the box," others required a bit more work.



Now with all the game elements iterated and working well, we’ll focus on connecting them even tighter and creating a coherent, total immersion experience.




With the recent 2.0 patch and Phantom Liberty DLC only improving things further, the game is now in the state that some would argue should have been the case at the start. Either way, CDPR is looking to evolve Cyberpunk 2077 as it moves forward with the franchise.

Sure, there’s the looming threat of Garlean invasion and/or the possibility of world destruction throughout A Realm Reborn and its expansions - but on the plus side, almost everyone you meet is up for a round of cards.


Over the last quarter-century, Triple Triad has managed to escape its origins as a fun side minigame in Final Fantasy VIII to become a fully-fledged phenomenon in XIV. The Gold Saucer runs regular tournaments, random strangers are happy to be challenged to a match - often throwing in one or more of the game’s many variant rules (though Chaos can do one) - and might even give up one of their prized cards when defeated, with almost 400 to collect as of the game’s latest patches. Emphasis on the “might”: I dread to think of the hours spent replaying NPCs in the hope of a random drop as I filled out my collection.

I headed along to Final Fantasy’s London Fan Fest last month with a fetching deck of Triple Triad cards in hand. (Square Enix provided entrance and accommodation for the event.) Where better to try and live the dream of challenging random strangers to a card game, and learn more about the community that has fallen in love with the MMO in the 10 years since A Realm Reborn released?

I’m not sure where to begin with this. I guess for anyone still in their early-20s or younger, a cassette tape is a cartridge the size of a standard Kit-Kat bar. They’re called “tapes” because their data is contained on a thin strip of plastic covered in a film conductive to magnetism. It stores data by magnetizing portions of it.

        <id>121449</id>
        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2023/11/03/hbos-the-last-of-us-season-2-set-to-premiere-in-2025"/>
        <updated>2023-11-03T12:02:03.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this year, HBO's The Last of Us successfully brought developer Naughty Dog's critically acclaimed and fan-favorite PlayStation exclusive to life on the TV screen. Its Season 1 premiere was HBO's second-largest debut since 2010, and its second episode broke records, too. Roughly three weeks after the premiere of the series, HBO revealed The Last of Us would be getting a second season. And now, thanks to a new Deadline report, we know it will start shooting next year and premiere sometime in 2025. 
Deadline learned this at a New York news event, where HBO boss Casey Bloys reportedly told press that Season 2 will head into production early next year, aiming for a 2025 premiere. Unfortunately, that's all Bloys said about the season. But, as noted by Deadline, series co-creator and executive producer Craig Mazin revealed earlier this summer pre-strike that the team was already able to get some work done, adding that the first episode was already written. 


"We got pretty far actually, we were doing great," Mazin told Deadline. "[The Last of Us game co-creator Neil Druckmann] and I had been sitting and talking with [The Last of Us Part II co-writer Halley Gross] and Bo Shim, the new writer that was in our little tiny room with us – obviously not a mini room because we're greenlit proper, we're a real show, and because I hate that mini room stuff."
Considering the first season of The Last of Us covered the events of the first Last of Us game, including its Left Behind DLC, it's clear Season 2 of the show will dive into The Last of Us Part II. We're all still awaiting some casting announcements, like who will play Abby and Lev, but that likely won't happen until the actor and writer strikes are over. 
In the meantime, read Game Informer's The Last of Us Part 1 review and then read our review of The Last of Us Part II.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a confession to make, readers. I'm mildly obsessed with Starfield's cuboid food brand Chunks. In all honesty, I'm kinda obsessed with Starfield's food in a more general sense, and I have almost as many screenshots of its tube-like meal boxes, stale toast slices, vacuum-packed sachets of rice balls, steak slabs and spiced worms - and, of course, Chunks - as I do its planets and NPCs. I'm weirdly fascinated by what Bethesda think our future meals will look like when we eventually start travelling across the stars, and not just because I like ragging on their somewhat plastic-looking textures and marvelling at how everything from orange juice to beer and wine comes in kid's size cartons with a little straw on the side. 
Chunks are my favourite food of the lot, though. These cubes of faintly glistening organic matter are bite-sized monstrosities that are quite possibly some of the most unholy things I've ever seen. How this became the dominating foodstuff across the known galaxy is a mystery worthy of its own sidequest, because let's be honest, I'm all for eating wonky fruit and vegetables, but would you truly go to shop, sit down at a table and order an apple that's been squeezed into a perfect cube? Or a cube with yellow skin that professes to call itself grilled chicken? I would probably try them once for curiosity's sake (it's the food of the future, of course I want to know what that tastes like!), but it's also exactly the kind of thing I'd swear off immediately because nope, nuh uh, I just can't even contemplate it anymore. And then it dawned on me: this is exactly how I feel about Starfield as a whole.

While it's technically Season 5 of Fortnite Chapter 4, which follows the previous Last Resort season, developer Epic Games is calling it Season OG, and it makes sense considering how much of Fortnite 2018 is making an appearance.
The throwback nostalgia continues throughout the season because each new update brings with it a different phase of Fortnite Chapter 1's past, starting with Season 5. That means weapons like the Assault Rifle and Pump Shotgun, and vehicles like Shopping Carts, will be featured in both Zero Build and regular Battle Royale Fortnite.

This narrative-driven first-person shooter has a loving reverence for the films and a good understanding of its protagonist, swinging for the fences with a lengthy original story, fun references, and plenty of enjoyably cheesy humor. Unfortunately, like the franchise’s vision of Detroit, Rogue City is very rough around the edges, resulting in a flawe…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III, the latest in the long-running FPS series that's also the first back-to-back sequel in years, is almost here – in fact, if you've preordered a digital version of the game, it's already here, kinda. That's because all digital version preorders unlock early access to the Modern Warfare III campaign. That's eight days before the full release on November 10, which is when its multiplayer suite goes live. Earlier this week, publisher Activision Blizzard and developer Sledgehammer Games released the PC specs and system requirements for the game. Now, we have our hands on Modern Warfare III and can tell you what the best graphics mode is on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S and what visual settings to use.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are very pleased to announce today the start of the testing period of two single-game engines: Kingdom: The Far Reaches and Escape From Hell!
Kingdom, was developed and released by Interplay in 1995. Only the DOS version of the game (available on gog.com) is supported. It's a cartoon FMV game, with an inventory, in which you have to guide Lathan Kandor through a medieval world, discovering the magic spells and the items required to defeat an evil wizard. 
Escape From Hell, was developed for Electronic Arts by the game veterans Richard Seaborne and Alan Murphy and was released in 1990. You play Alan in this keyboard-only Role Playing Game and visit Hell, looking for your girlfriend who was accidentally teleported there.
Both games use heavily hardcoded logic which is error prone and requires a lot of testing, so we need your feedback more than ever as they are both incompletely tested. There is sadly only one known demo for Kingdom. Support for the Windows and Mac versions of Kingdom may come later! Please contact us if you have some other demos of both games.
To play any of these games, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker and please take some screenshots along the way!

In dozens of local and international news reports, this 'official' figure is cited verbatim. We have zero faith in it, and we aren't alone. After a silent unreferenced edit, the police press release now reads €366,250, but the government's copy remains intact.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Like when Sir Alex Ferguson oversaw his final game at Old Trafford, there’s a complicated atmosphere surrounding this year’s Football Manager. Football Manager 2024 is the last iterative game in the series before Project Dragonfly arrives next year, through which Sports Interactive plan the most radical overhaul of the game since the introduction of the 3D match engine in FM 09. This includes a complete rebuild of Football Manager in Unity, implementing brand new animation technology, and the inclusion of women’s football. But there is a reason why the studio has stuck with this tried and tested formula for so long. Big changes come with big risks, and as any Man Utd fan will know, those changes don’t always pay off.


But such concerns are for the future. FM24 is with us right now, and while it may be swapping the dugout for the stands ninety minutes from now, this isn’t some ceremonial exhibition match. It’s business as usual, and in mostly good ways. Sports Interactive have made meaningful changes to the management game both on and off the pitch, all built on top of fundamentals that remain as complex and compulsive as they have for years. That said, FM24 also demonstrates why a change is welcome, as in its current form it can struggle to strike the balance between authenticity and fun.

I rarely replay games, let alone horror games, which are often one-and-done sorts of things - though I do, of course, enter the Pumpkin Carving Festival every year.

We discuss the arrival of AI voices in big-name games, the disappointingly businessy thinking behind it, and whether we can think up some uses for AI-generated material that we can actually get behind. All sparked by voice actor Gianni Matragrano’s video compilation of the lines in question, which you should probably watch before listening to this episode, or there’ll be a bit where Nate appears to bellow "THE KING FISH" for no reason. Well, maybe not no reason. It’s still Nate.


Plus! We talk about what we’ve been playing this week, which coincidentally for me was The Finals, while Nate’s been digging deeper into the Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor demo. I also recount the teeth-based controversy surrounding Cities: Skyline 2, in turn begging the question: what are they going to do with all those teeth?

It's billed as a detective game for true crime fans, but it reminds me of those puzzle books you used to get, where you are shown an illustration of a crime scene and, if you stare at it long enough, can figure out the assigned solution. Scene Investigators is like that but the scene is a big 3D one you can walk around. A crime has happened and you need to figure out what, mostly by peering at the dates in a diary to cross reference them with the time and day a phone message was left. This is why I wouldn't recommend it to everyone. It's quite hard. But! Some people will really like it.

I hold its metal head in my hands, tilting it this way and that as I stare into its cold red eye. It offers no resistance to my pushes and pulls, as though I was a hairdresser directing a patron’s head. Based on Stanisław Lem’s 1964 novel of the same name, The Invincible’s Firewatch-like first-person adventure is intent on exploring how machines will come to shape humanity’s future. Over the course of its ten-hour story, where you step into the Soviet-styled space boots of biologist Yasna, you will take on her desperate search for the missing crew of her research ship, The Dragonfly, lost somewhere on the rocky, sandstorm-whipped world of Regis III.
Using a logbook filled with hand-drawn maps and scrawled notes, I’ve tracked Yasna’s crew to a makeshift game to the east of where they originally landed. Instead of humans, I find the lifeless robot. I want the android to give me answers, to tell me where my crew mates are, to explain what happened on Regis III, and why I can’t remember anything before I woke up in the desert with my possessions scattered around me.

But it ends this week, with Epic bringing players back to the Chapter 1 map for the next season of Chapter 4. Thanks to a new trailer released today, we know this throwback season is called Season OG, is a part of Chapter 4, and will be bringing with it a heavy dose of nostalgia.

Back in the '90s, Nintendo played faster and looser with its library of characters. Sometimes Yoshi showed up in The Legend of Zelda, and Kirby was whatever color he felt like at the moment, be it gray or pink. In 1996, that laissez-faire attitude was in full effect for the release of Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars for the Super Nintendo. Link, Samus, and even Donkey Kong (sort of) all had inexplicable cameos in the game, and one of my big questions about the remake was whether or not those would move forward. If you're ready to learn the answer for at least some of them, read on!
Impressively, the answer is yes! At least for Link and Donkey Kong. I have not been able to play to the point in the game where Samus appears, so I can't answer that question yet. When you get close to Link after seeing him in the sleeping bed, a "talk" option appears, and when you click it, a Zelda musical sting plays.
Donkey Kong's cameo has always been questionable as to whether or not it is him, as he is just labeled "Guerilla", but he sure looks a lot like Donkey Kong, just with a crown.

The Super Mario RPG remake releases November 17 for Nintendo Switch.

Ahead of his debut, NetherRealm Studios has released the official Omni-Man gameplay trailer and alongside hard-hitting (and gory) super moves, it features a brutal and show-accurate fatality for the character. 
The trailer teases Liu Kang for allowing a Viltrumite into the Realms of Mortal Kombat before more than two minutes of Omni-Man action plays out. And closing out the trailer is the fatality for the upcoming Kombat Pack character. We won't spoil it here, so check it out in the Mortal Kombat 1 Omni-Man gameplay trailer below:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in August, a Pokémon Presents revealed that the first part of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet's DLC, collectively known as The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero, would hit the game in September. That has since come and gone, with players eagerly awaiting the second part of this expansion. And now, the official Pokémon Twitter account has revealed The Indigo Disk DLC goes live next month. 


More specifically, The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero Part 2: The Indigo Disk hits Pokémon Scarlet and Violet on December 14. As those keeping up with Game Freak's ninth generation of Pokémon know, The Indigo Disk brings players to Blueberry Academy, which is actually in the Unova region, rather than the Paldea region where Pokémon Scarlet and Violet take place. The Unova region is the setting for Pokémon Black and White, and their sequels, Pokémon Black 2 and White 2. 
Pokémon Scarlet or Pokémon Violet The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero Part 2: The Indigo Disk launches on December 14!

November 2, 2023
Many players are speculating that The Indigo Disk will, in some way, tease remakes of the fifth generation of Pokémon, as those are next in line for Game Freak's cadence of remaking previously released Pokémon games. With players leaving Paldea to check out an academy in Unova, many predict some hint at potential Pokémon Black and White remakes await trainers. But only time will tell. 
Pokémon Scarlet and Violet: The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero Part 2 – The Indigo Disk hits the games on December 14. The DLC can be purchased as a pack for $34.99. 
For more, read about how after The Indigo Disk is out, every starter Pokémon will be available in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, and then read Game Informer's Pokémon Scarlet and Violet review.

For The King 2, at least, seems pretty trim and digestible at a reported 30 hours in length. Released out of early access today, it's a blend of fantasy table-top gaming and roguelite, in which you lead a party of adventurers across a hexagonal map to quash an evil Queen in grid, dice and turn-based combat.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What kind of game does the label “survival horror” denote? Since its inconspicuous first appearance in the original Resident Evil’s loading screen (functioning first and foremost, lest we forget, as a handy marketing catchphrase), the term has been so enthusiastically embraced and haphazardly applied as to be rendered almost meaningless in 2023. Horror gaming has witnessed multiple seismic shifts since 1996, most notably the turn to action-oriented design with the likes of The Suffering and Resident Evil 4 in the mid-2000s, as well as the rise of spooky almost-walking-simulators like SOMA in the mid-2010s. 

Yet the term survival horror has expanded to such a degree that it now seems to stand in, albeit rather awkwardly, for the entirety of video game horror. Even with the caveat that borders for these kinds of labels are notoriously hard to define, survival horror remains an unusually amorphous realm, one that (as a quick search of the relevant tag on Steam will reveal) lays claim as much to first-person bloodbaths like Zombie Army Trilogy as it does moody, combat-free adventures like Visage. Still, old distinctions linger, and a clutch of recent indie survival horrors qualify their work with the word “classic”. I interviewed some of the developers to find out why - and, more importantly, what classic survival horror means.

        <updated>2023-11-02T13:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Game Informer can exclusively reveal Assassin's Creed Valhalla: The Hidden Codex, a new graphic novel from Dark Horse Books that brings players back into the world of assassin Eivor, a medieval Nordic land, a new hidden order, and more. It will be released as a hardcover graphic novel on April 30, 2024, in retail stores and online, for $19.99 (and it hits comic book stores on May 1, 2024). Mathieu Gabella is the author, with art from Paolo Traisci. 
The Hidden Codex follows Edward, a scribe and reluctant monk after he escapes from a kidnapping performed by a clan of Vikings. After securing his freedom, Edward finds his brother missing and strange documents "blackened by a language he innately understands." 
"No one knows where these occult-looking symbols came from, but Edward has seen such writings before: in the workshop of an enigmatic wise man among the Vikings who is part of a secret order: Those Unseen," a press release reads. "An order that could offer answers to Edward, and guarantee his aspirations of freedom and knowledge. But with that knowledge, can he find and rescue his own brother before it's too late?"
Ubisoft senior transmedia content manager Etienne Bouvier says the company is lucky to work with Gabella and Traisci as they are two long-standing fans of the Assassin's Creed franchise who infused their love of it, and knowledge of its lore, into this book. 
Assassin's Creed Valhalla: The Hidden Codex hits bookshelves and online retailers on April 30, 2024, before it hits comic book stores on May 1. It is available for preorder now and costs $19.99. 
For more about the series, read Game Informer's Assassin's Creed Valhalla review and then read our Assassin's Creed Mirage review. After that, read Game Informer's ranking of every Assassin's Creed game.

We’ll apparently find out in just over a month, as The Day Before’s release date has now been announced as December 5th following yet another slide back from its previous date of November 10th. That’s after developers Fntastic previously promised that there wouldn’t be any more delays - something its latest ‘Final Trailer’ presumably vows once again.

Mafia II: Definitive Edition
This remaster of the 2010 crime game spruces up the adventure with improved HD visuals. It also includes all of its post-launch DLC. You can us take a tour of the game in this episode of New Gameplay Today.
Dragon Ball: The Breakers
This 7-v-1 multiplayer game pits a team of random normies, plus Bulma and Oolong, against a player controlling iconic Dragon Ball villains like Frieza, Cell, and Buu. The non-villains must work together to survive and escape stages in a time machine. The villain player’s job is simple: hunt and destroy everyone else. 
Aliens: Fireteam Elite
Up to four-players team up to battle hordes of xenomorphs in this cooperative class-based shooter. In our review, former editor Jason Guisao gave it a 6.5/10, writing, 
As a reminder, you have until November 6 to add October's monthly games to your library.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Large gaming monitors can reach some crazy-high prices - so what's to stop you from getting a smaller 4K TV instead? You get a much bigger screen for the money plus TV functionality, and if you choose carefully you won't give up PC niceties like 4K 120Hz support or  FreeSync and G-Sync compatibility. 
This leads us neatly on to the 42-inch LG C3 OLED, which has dropped to £949 at Currys in the UK for Black Friday (it's normally £1399). This tasty £450 discount brings the monitor down to a price that it actually offers better value than many large-format gaming monitors, while offering far superior HDR, incredible motion clarity and of course full compatibility with PS5 and Series X consoles.

And also fan-made video games, like a weird SpongeBob SquarePants fever dream that James experienced while full of milk and chili, and the Waterworld arcade game (as imagined in The Simpsons). Plus, we talk about games we've been playing recently, which includes Alan Wake 2. Alice does an unhinged rant while unaware she is once again ravaged by Covid.


This is why episode 35 is coming out a week after it was supposed to: yes, I had coronavirus the entire time! Apologies for the delay. But, you know, not like loads, I was pretty sick.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It is perhaps ironic that in attempting to crystalise my thoughts about Alan Wake 2 - a game about a novelist with such crippling writer's block that they end up spawning an entire evil doppelganger of themselves to sabotage their own work - I, too, have been hopelessly staring at a blank screen for the better part of 24 hours. I have not, thank goodness, reached the stage where my psyche's split in two (yet), but this spiral of self-doubt has now got to the point where I simply have put words, any words, in front of one another to write my way out of this hellish pit of despair. 
Alan himself goes through a similar ordeal of writing to escape as he tries to find a way out of the prison-like dimension known as The Dark Place, where he's been trapped since the events of the first game - and I take heart from the fact that it's clearly well-worn territory for the folks at Remedy as well, such is the forensic precision in the way it's portrayed onscreen: a chaotic, supernatural tornado that not only threatens to unravel Alan's own identity, but also the wider world as we know it. It's imposter syndrome writ large, and honestly, Remedy are pretty on the money with this one. Horace is not a pretty taskmaster when the words stop coming.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Thirsty Suitors is a dazzling new entry in a genre that is always badly in need of bolstering: turn-based RPGs without anime aesthetics and a story about something other than killing God. The game sees you play as Jala, who returns to her dilapidated hometown after getting dumped by the older woman for whom she abandoned college and her high school sweetheart. Waiting for her is a disappointed mother, a soon-to-be-wed sister who refuses to even speak to her, and a shadowy cabal formed of her spurned exes from the time in her life when rampant, unrelenting teen horniness nearly ripped the town apart. Jala’s journey to redemption and genuine adulthood will take her to the psychic plane to do cathartic (if overly simplistic) battle with her wronged exes, to the local skatepark to pull off some janky grinds, and to grounded emotional revelations that are rarely written this well in videogames.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Marvel's Spider-Man 2 hit PlayStation 5 exclusively on October 20 and quickly became Sony's fastest-selling first-party game. While we loved the game – read Game Informer's Marvel's Spider-Man 2 review here – players have discovered bugs and issues leading to laughter and, in some cases, progress impediment. Fortunately, developer Insomniac Games has been quick to fix issues with updates, like one last week that fixed an incorrect flag and the infamous white cube model issue. 
Now, the studio has released another update targeting various bugs players might be encountering in the game related to specific missions, shortcuts, tutorials, and more. 


Here's the full Update Version 1.001.004 release notes: 
Addressed an issue where players could become stuck during the finale of Marko's Memories
Addressed an issue where a boss could become stuck in geometry
Addressed multiple issues where the player could become stuck during the Galvanize tutorial
Addressed an issue where players with shortcuts enabled could become stuck in a puzzle during the New Threads mission
Addressed an issue where the Charge Jump would break when assigned to a shortcut
Addressed an issue where the Upgraded Classic suit had duplicate eye details
Further addressed issues where models would not load properly after long play sessions
Improved stability 
Hopefully, if one of these issues has stopped you from progressing past certain points in Marvel's Spider-Man 2's various quests, you'll be able to advance after installing this update. 
For more about the game, read Game Informer's Marvel's Spider-Man 2 review and then read about how Insomniac updated New York City for the sequel. Then check out this story about this missing NYC landmark in the game. After that, read our guide for the best graphics mode in Marvel's Spider-Man 2, and then check out our spoiler-free tips.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gran Turismo 7 is getting its biggest update tomorrow in the form of Spec II (a.k.a update 1.40). The content drop, which is free, adds a new cooperative mode, seven new cars, a fresh track, and more.


Perhaps the update’s biggest addition is four-player local split-screen. Unfortunately for PS4 players, this option is only available on PS5. Speaking of PS5-only features, those players can enjoy taking on Gran Turismo Sophy, which developer Polyphony Digital describes as a “prototype revolutionary racing AI agent” 
Spec II also adds the snowy Lake Louise track. Set in a Canadian ski resort, it comes in three variants: long track, short track, and tri-oval. New Master License events are coming and the update also adds quality-of-life features, such as a dashboard that tracks player progression.
Of course, new vehicles are always exciting, and here are the seven joining the roster:
Dodge Charger R/T 426 Hemi '68
Dodge Challenger SRT Demon '18
Lexus LFA '10
Mercedes-Benz 190 E 2.5-16 Evolution II '91
NISMO 400R '95
Porsche 911 GT3 RS (992) '22
Tesla Model 3 Performance '23
Spec II adds a host of smaller additions, such as new Cafe menus and new photo mode options, and you can read a complete breakdown by reading the blog post on the Gran Turismo website. You can download the update on November 2. For more on Gran Turismo 7, check out our review.]]></summary>

Ever since its first title 20 years ago, the WarioWare franchise has shapeshifted to take advantage of the capabilities and gimmicks of whatever the current Nintendo platform was. But the first entry on Switch, Get It Together, bucked that trend, putting you in control of the actual cast of characters in platforming-style microgames instead of taking advantage of the Switch’s unique traits. WarioWare: Move It aligns more with the traditional WarioWare experience, resulting in a better overall collection.

Dr. Eggman has discovered The Reverie, a special ancient device that can manifest dreams in the real world, and it's up to Sonic the Hedgehog and friends to stop him from doing so. Players must navigate "twisted dreamscapes, rescue your friends, and put a stop to Dr. Eggman's nightmarish dreams of world domination." 
Sonic Dream Team features six playable characters in Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, Amy Rose, Cream, and Rouge, and Sega says each character brings their own flair and personality alongside three movement types "that provide unique exploration opportunities while navigating the dream world." It also features four boss battles, never-before-seen worlds spread across "four unique dream worlds with mind-bending environments that include wall-running, gravity changes, and more." Plus, Sonic Dream Team can be played on iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple TV. 
Check out the Sonic Dream Team reveal trailer for yourself below: 


And here are some Sonic Dream Team screenshots too:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Beware major plot spoilers for the entire Amnesia series, together with descriptions of fictional torturing techniques.

The most ghoulish of Amnesia's many ghoulish ideas is "vitae". It's a luminous, blue-green fluid that can be used as an energy source, a chemical catalyst and a supernatural healing agent. Each Amnesia game is broadly a story about the production of vitae, with some levels consisting of huge distillation and refining apparata, and major plot developments tied to what you do with it. In the original Amnesia: The Dark Descent, you'll brew potions using vitae in order to keep a decapitated head alive. In 2020's Amnesia: Rebirth, you'll use ornate metal cannisters of the stuff like batteries to power otherworldly machines. Vitae is the blood and breath of Amnesia, the grease upon the narrative axels, the fuel in its boiler, the miracle McGuffin that sustains its nastier flights of fantasy. But what is vitae, exactly? Agony.

After a September patch that included various changes to make the Soulslike action RPG easier, game director Jiwon Choi has released a Director's Letter to confirm plans for a Lies of P sequel, tease DLC for the game with two new images, and more. 
Lies Of P Sequel Confirmed


Choi began the video thanking players for helping the game sell 1 million copies in less than two months after release. He then sneakily drops a line confirming the Pinocchio-inspired Soulslike is getting a sequel. 
"Our highest priority is developing the DLC and working on the sequel," Choi says in the Director's Letter. "The dev team…]]></summary>

Mind you, it appears the associated functionality was secretly part of Bethesda's sci-fi RPG all along, perhaps destined to be unlocked by a DLC pack, like a slumbering fairytale royal awaiting true love's kiss.
The modder in question is vexthecollector, whose catchily-named Spacestations for Outposts lets you bolt together hab modules, windows and docking bays to fashion your very own Deep Space Nine. Sadly for my character, the acutely terra-phobic star pirate Mary Read, you'll need to first build an outpost on a planet in order to access the goods.

Sekiro is still one of the toughest soulslikes around, absolutely filled with extremely dangerous bosses and twisted body-horror monstrosities that can carve you up with just a couple of hits, sending you back to the last checkpoint bereft of all your XP. But the Headless scares me so much, I actively avoid facing it until I have absolutely no choice.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jusant is all show, no tell, which is a bold swing. Video game characters aren't often big on show don't tell in 2023. A lot of them have been cursed by their creators to narrate everything they do, as they do it, incase the meatsacks controlling them are unable to parse even one second of what is happening on screen without direction. I love HZD's Aloy, but does she ever just stream-of-consciousness her way through life.
In contrast, the nameless protagonist in Don't Nod's new climbing puzzle adventure (what even are genres?) is also silent. There are no other NPCs. You are climbing up through the ruins of an old civilisation. As such, Jusant relies on the devs having crafted an understandable world that you can barely interact with, aside from painstakingly climbing across it like a spidery archaeologist. You've got to have faith in your environmental storytelling if you're making a game like that. And Don't Nod have nailed it.

Jusant asks players to do one thing: climb. As a silent mountaineer accompanied by a cute critter, the only thing standing between you and your mysterious mission is one very tall mountain. The journey to its summit is treacherous, but thanks to an ingenious climbing system, beautiful art direction, and intriguing world-building, inching toward the top is worth the effort. 
The intuitive climbing mechanics are the star of the show. Pressing the left and right shoulder buttons lets you grip handholds with the correspond…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A little knowledge can be worse than no knowledge at all. I know a little about the Yakuza series, having reviewed the 1980s-set Yakuza Zero for this very parish in 2018, and tried a bit of 2019's turn-based battler Yakuza: Like A Dragon. Fast-forward to 2023, and all Yakuza games are now Like A Dragon games, including the forthcoming Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth, which is an... Animal Crossing game, actually? With skateboarding? I'm still getting my head around the existence of a zombie spin-off, Dead Souls, to say nothing of the samurai-era Like A Dragon: Ishin. And then there's the inter-quel Like a Dragon Gaiden, due this November, which seems like a relatively straight-laced delve into the past of original protagonist Kazuma Kiryu. Phew, it's just as well Ed Thorn wrote that guide to the order you should play the Yakuza games in.


It sounds like the developers at Ryu ga Gotoku Studio have a hard time keeping track themselves, especially given the rate at which Sega publish Like A Dragon games. According to studio director Masayoshi Yokoyama, Like A Dragon's creators feel a lot of pressure to get the games done quickly, not just with a view to making money but because as projects that riff so copiously on pop culture, Like A Dragon stories go out of date fast.

And yet! That's a large part of what I enjoy about the new subterranean survival-craft-'em-up The Lord Of The Rings: Return To Moria. It's a slower, more weighty survival game than you might be used to if you're a Valheim or ARK type, for example, and you'll spend a lot of your time in the dark. But what is this, a survival game for elves? No sir. And besides, like I said, it's rather sweet. Cosy, even.

Ahead of the premiere (release? Launch?) of the experimental Silent Hill Ascension tonight, we had a chance to speak with the developer Genvid about the game (TV show? Crowd-directed narrative?) is, what it will mean to the Silent Hill universe, and how much work is going into animating the versions of the narrative that may never be seen.
Calling Ascension a video game is almost a misnomer. There is an interactive element, but you won’t be holding a controller in your hand pushing characters to make decisions in the traditional sense. Instead, viewers will download the Silent Hill Ascension app on mobile devices or PC (there is a PlayStation option, but only for viewing episodes, not participating)…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've only just read Sin's thoughts on Akuma Kira's Lunacid and lo and behold, the PS1-styled, first-person dungeon crawler has now released out of Steam Early Access, to considerable rejoicing. Lunacid is a homage to classic FromSoftware games - no, not that juvenile upstart Dark Souls, but King's Field and Shadow's Tower, which date back to the late 1990s. 


I played one of the King's Field games as a sprog and found it to be an extended cave system full of lava, demons and torment. Lunacid sort of applies the perspective and medieval fantasy combat of that series to a story reminiscent of Demon's Souls - the From-alike that spurred the Japanese studio to international fame - with a world that has been flooded with toxic mist by a "sleeping old one below". Your job, as some unfortunate outcast chucked into a pit, is to journey downward and confront this mysterious creature, using any and all combinations of rapiers, clubs and fireballs. Off you go then.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Toby Fox followed up their 2015 critically acclaimed and fan-favorite 2D RPG Undertale with Deltarune Chapter 1 in 2018. This chapter was the first in what we'd later learn is a five-chapter top-down RPG with puzzles, bullet hell sequences, and Final Fantasy-inspired combat, and Chapter 1 was released for free. Fox dropped Chapter 2 in 2021 in a surprise announcement, and now, players patiently await the release of Chapter 3. Today, more than two years later, Fox has revealed an updated plan for their Deltarune release strategy. 


With Chapter 3 nearing completion, Fox plans to finish Chapter 4 and release Deltarune as a purchaseable product. And following that, development on Chapter 5 will continue and hit the game when it's ready. To help with this, Fox has hired a producer "whose entire job it will be to speed up the overall game development for future chapters," according to a new statement released. 
You can read Fox's full statement below: 
Elsewhere in the update, Fox says Chapter 3 took a lot of trial and error to figure out how it would work but that with Chapter 4, "I already feel very confident about how we can progress." They also note that people on the team are already transitioning back into working on Chapter 4 and that everybody is excited to work on that part of Deltarune. 
For more about the game, watch the original Deltarune teaser and then check out this Chapter 2 teaser. After that, read Game Informer's Undertale review.

These include the modestly-known about Control 2, a sequel to the paranormal Brutalist telekinet 'em up that is seeing "good progress", and the forthcoming remakes of Max Payne 1 and 2, on which Remedy are collaborating with GTA and Max Payne 3 developer Rockstar.
Further afield, there's the mysterious Condor project, a co-op multiplayer Control spin-off (pictured above) that builds on Remedy's experience crafting the single-player component for wayward service-based shooter CrossfireX. And at the very edge of sight, there's the faint outline of something called Codename Vanguard, about which naff-all is known. Could it be that "crazy, huge budget, dark gothic fantasy" Remedy's creative director Sam Lake would like one day to make?

That requires, quite literally, getting back to their roots as they reconnect with Eywa while learning what it means to be a Na’vi by ingratiating themselves with the game’s three new clans.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Finals, the cash-grabbing, destructible-scenery multiplayer FPS from former Battlefield devs, is currently in the middle of an open beta that allows anyone to go and give its shoot-y, smash-y, cash-y gameplay a look. You’ll also be able to give it a listen - and you might notice something a little off about the announcers for its game show-within-a-game when you do. That’s right: they’re AI-generated voices, not human actors.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Update, 11/01/23:
IGN and Bloomberg have learned new information about the layoffs that occurred at Destiny 2 maker Bungie this week, including that roughly 100 employees were laid off from the company. As for why, IGN's sources report that during an employee meeting after the layoffs, Bungie CEO Pete Parsons told staff that the layoffs were due to the underperformance of Destiny 2 over the last year as well as "lower-than-expected preorders" for the upcoming expansion, The Final Shape. 
Employees were reportedly told that Destiny 2 player sentiment had reached an all-time-low and IGN's sources say employees at the studio have attempted to discuss this with Bungie leadership, asking to make the necessary changes, presumably to get player sentiment back up. 
Bloomberg reports that roughly 8…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III, the latest in the long-running FPS franchise and the first back-to-back sequel in years, is due out later this week, kind of. If you preorder a digital version of the game, you can play through its campaign early, starting November 2. That's eight days before the full game's release on November 10, which is when its multiplayer suite goes live. Ahead of that early campaign launch, publisher Activision Blizzard has released the PC specs and system requirements to play Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III. 
If you've played recent Call of Duty entries, you likely already know what you're in for, and this year's is not all that different. But if you're new, or curious if you need to upgrade before this year's entry, we've got you covered.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Crytek have no plans to make a sequel to sweaty monster-culling FPS Hunt: Showdown, and will thus hopefully avoid the publicity problems currently faced by Activision-Blizzard's Overwatch 2 and Valve's Counter-Strike 2 - both presented as sequels with fancier technology, but in practice, more like service-game content seasons arbitrarily upgraded into replacements, with the 'previous' games, Overwatch and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, being taken offline to avoid splitting the playerbase. 


Speaking to me in an interview about Hunt's evolution since its launch out of early access in 2019, the game's general manager David Fifield observed that while Crytek may yet make another Hunt game it won't be a straight Showdown follow-up - and it certainly won't come at the expense of your ability to play the original game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in June, when our Ed got a 30-minute hands-off glimpse of Avatar: Frontiers Of Pandora, he had suspicions that Ubisoft's next big open world-athon was hiding some dark, terrible secret beneath the surface. It was almost too good, and too lovely-looking to be completely true, he proposed, and the brief tour of this rather enormous-looking game wasn't quite long enough to really dig beneath the surface to see if Ubisoft's lofty promises would hold up to closer scrutiny. 
Now, just over a month from release, I've finally been able to put it under a proper microscope, playing two hours of the thing from around the 25% mark of its campaign. And it really is as visually impressive as Ed suggested all those months ago. At long last, this is a game that looks and feels like an actual "next-gen" blockbuster (or as much as a game can, at least, when we're already several years into the current generation cycle). But Ed was also right to feel a wee bit suspicious of Frontiers Of Pandora. Perhaps not in the way he expected, but enough that I heard the same thing being muttered over and over again by almost everyone at the end of my preview session at Ubisoft's UK offices: "I can't work out where the heck I'm meant to be going, or what I'm supposed to do."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Square Enix revealed Kingdom Hearts Missing-Link, a new GPS-based action RPG for iOS and Android devices, last year as part of its 20th Anniversary celebration, which is also where the company revealed Kingdom Hearts IV. Now, Square Enix has released a new teaser trailer for Missing-Link alongside the reveal it will launch sometime next year. 
In the teaser trailer, we see someone who is presumably the game's protagonist in Scala ad Caelum, a special metropolis that those who have completed Kingdom Hearts III will recognize. The teaser showcases the RPG's combat as well, which seems like a mix between some of the mechanics in Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories and standard mobile action RPG gameplay. We also see some of the Disney characters in the game, including Ariel from The Little Mermaid, Simba from The Lion King, and Baymax from Big Hero 6, to name a few. 
Check out the Kingdom Hearts Missing-Link teaser trailer for yourself below: 


Square Enix says it is now recruiting testers from the U.K. and Australia for a closed Missing-Link beta test, and if eligible, you can apply here.
Kingdom Hearts Missing-Link is due out on iOS and Android in 2024. 
For more, watch the original Missing-Link reveal trailer and then watch the Kingdom Hearts IV reveal trailer. Check out this Sora Amiibo coming out next year after that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apologies to the chief, but there’s a not-entirely-accurate bit in Katharine’s post announcing Starfield as October’s RPS Game Club game. I, of the RPS Treehouse, do truly love Starfield, and have only been quiet about it because admitting you enjoy The Grey Bethesda Game but couldn’t get into Baldur's Gate 3 or Elden Ring feels a bit like going to the Savoy Grill and only ordering chips. No one will ask you to leave, but they’ll probably start questioning your judgement.
But dammit, I like chips, and I like Starfield! I like its roving space captain fantasy, I like its utilitarian aesthetic, and I like how its click-clacking guns sound like extremely violent mechanical keyboards. Especially if I get to fire them at floating pirates, while I’m also floating, and said firing punts me upwards into a ceiling.

No, not like that. Well, not entirely like that. I mean "perverse" more straightforwardly as in deliberately awkward and unreceptive in their core design, almost self-defeating in a way that has you saying "WTF?" and hankering to know more.
Take The Great Below, a new horror... thingmabob from Cantabria-based Dobra Studios. It's about exploring a strange house full of dreadful paintings in the dark. It's a 3D game with keyboard move-look controls, but the twist is that you can only move around while looking at a 2D map, with your position marked as a pair of footprints.

I'm not sure I'd be able to tell you. For whatever reason, the 3D character platformer has become an increasingly rare breed, it would seem, which makes them even more heartening to see when they do occasionally poke their head above the parapet and leap onto our screens. Song Of Nunu: A League Of Legends Story is one of them, channelling the joyous, boundless enthusiasm of its late 90s and early 00s predecessors to create a simple, but straightforward adventure that you could just as easily enjoy alone as an adult, or with a child in tow. It did not, alas, quite make me cry as developers Tequila Works intended (that honour still belongs to Rime and Rime alone out of their back catalogue), but there's much to admire here while having your heartstrings lightly plucked at the same time. And you don't need to know a jot about League Of Legends to enjoy it.

Having had a bit more of a look at the game’s social sim aspects via this week’s Xbox Partner Preview - yep, it still looks gorgeous and sounds fantastic.

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2023/10/27/wolverine-game-set-in-the-same-universe-as-marvels-spider-man-insomniac-confirms"/>
        <updated>2023-10-27T22:35:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since Insomanic revealed its Wolverine game two years ago, fans have wondered if it’s set in the same universe as the studio’s Spider-Man games. In an interview with Kinda Funny, Spider-Man 2 director Bryan Intihar confirmed the answer is yes
When host Greg Miller asked if it had been previously confirmed or denied whether or not their spin on Wolverine shared the same Earth as its Spider-Men, Intihar replied by saying, “They’re all 1048. I think I got that right, but yeah.” Inthiar is referring to Earth-1048, which is the designation for the Marvel universe Insonmiac’s superhero games occupy.
You can watch the clip beginning at the 1:10:44 mark (thanks IGN). 


Whether or not that means we’ll see any Spider-Man references in Wolverine, which does not have a release window, remains to be seen, but that’s exciting news regardless. Marvel’s Spider-Man’s New York City is chock full of references to other heroes, such as Avengers Tower, the Sanctum Sanctorum, and the Wakandan Embassy, so it made more sense to imagine Logan doing his thing somewhere out there.
Beyond this update, we know little about Wolverine other than that it will be a mature-rated title exclusive to the PlayStation 5. As we wait to learn more details, you can read this opinion piece on why I'd like to see the two game series share the same universe.]]></summary>

A target appears on your back when you’re a long-reigning champ. No longer the enigma you once were, contenders begin studying your body of work to figure out the path to ending your time at the top. The best way to fend off would-be challengers is to continually build and evolve. Developer EA Vancouver seems to understand this because while no legitimate contenders have emerged in the mixed-martial-arts genre, EA Sports UFC 5 retools several key areas to show the franchise isn’t resting on its laurels.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new gameplay video for Little Nightmares III offers a lengthy look at its two-player cooperative gameplay. Like the previous games, this third outing looks every bit as moody and unsettling. 
This pre-alpha footage shows playable characters, Low and Alone, exploring The Necropolis, a desert-like zone, working together to overcome its many obstacles. For example, when attacked by flying beetles, one shoots them down with a bow while the other smashes the downed targets with a wrench. The kids’ biggest threat, at least in this slice, comes in the form of a giant, rampaging doll aptly known as "Monster Baby". It’s supremely creepy, and you can see for yourself below.


Unlike the first two games, which were developed by Tarsier Studios, Little Nightmares III is being made by Supermassive Games, makers of Until Dawn and The Dark Pictures Anthology. It’s scheduled to launch next year for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you love The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker but wish it had more blood, death and inclement weather in it, consider Sands of Aura. Released out of early access today, this is a top-down fantasy action-RPG set in a swirling, post-apocalyptic world in which you build up a town and sail between island dungeons in a sandship.
The sandship, or rather, "grainwake" sailing sees you bouncing merrily from dunes as vast, ominous structures loom out of the haze. The combat takes some inspiration from the Souls games, but the top-down perspective makes it feel like a classic arcade action title. Boss battles involve dodging or parrying colourful streaks, waves and clusters of projectiles. The developers, 12-person Chashu Entertainment, say it's a difficult experience. It looks it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the last year or so, it seems Apple has come to realize the devices it is putting in everyone's pockets are actually quite powerful and can do a whole lot more than just browse the internet and send text messages. Playing video games on a phone is familiar practice, but with the release of iPhone 15, Apple is making a push to compete with the likes of PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X. This is why games like Death Stranding and Resident Evil Village are making their way to the newest iOS device, the latter of which releases October 30.
In honor of that looming release, Marcus joined me for a look at the game on this new platform. It's difficult to show exactly what Resident Evil Village looks on iPhone 15. The screen looks sharper and the framerate is higher than I am able to capture, but we do our best to offer at least a small taste. To ruin the thesis of the video a bit, the conclusion is that Resident Evil Village on iPhone 15 looks good and plays well! As long as you are playing with a controller. The touch-controls render the game nearly unplayable. The U.I. is supremely distracting and Resident Evil Village was not built with the touch controls in mind, and it shows. But if you have a Backbone controller or a Bluetooth controller (like a PS4 or PS5 controller) than you will be in good shape to fight werewolves and Lady Dimitrescu on a handheld platform.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After weeks of in-game teases and more, Epic Games has officially confirmed that the next season of Fortnite will bring players back to Chapter 1. With Fortnite loading screens hiding secret dates that point to Chapter 1: Season 5 and props from that season landing on this current season's map, players have remain convinced that the next season, Chapter 4: Season 5 will actually bring everyone back to an older chapter of Fortnite; now we know it's happening. 
Today's reveal comes by way of the official Fortnite Twitter account, which posted, "Sprint (or Mantle, your choice) back to Chapter 1...see you soon 11.3.2023 #FortniteOG" with an image of the Fortnite battle bus.

October 27, 2023
As you can see, the above Tweet confirms what many have been speculating: Fortnite is going back to its Chapter 1 roots. And while not officially confirmed, it's likely the Chapter 4: Season 5 map will have some Chapter 1: Season 5 integration on it based on teases over the past few weeks. 
Fortnite Chapter 4: Season 5 launches November 3.

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2023/10/27/ataris-berzerk-recharged-gets-november-release-date"/>
        <updated>2023-10-27T12:49:09.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this year, Atari announced that it acquired Berzerk, its sequel Frenzy, and 10 other classic arcade properties. Then, earlier this month, Atari revealed Berzerk: Recharged, the first Berzerk game since the original 1980s arcade game. At the time, the company said it was coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC, and now we know exactly when: November 9. 
"On November 9, Evil Otto once again invites you to his maze of maniacal chaos in the newly reimagined Berzerk: Recharged," an Atari press release reads. "The latest entry in Atari's acclaimed Recharged series, Berzerk: Recharged will have you almost begging for mercy as you face off against Otto's droves of robotic menaces, all while the grinning incarnation of evil draws ever nearer." 
Alongside this release date news, Atari has released some additional Berzerk: Recharged screenshots you can check out below: 

For more about the game, including details about what to expect, read Game Informer's prior Berzerk: Recharged coverage here.

        <updated>2023-10-27T12:10:30.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yesterday was a great day for fans of the most emo Batman in the Caped Crusader's cinematic history because Robert Pattinson's suit from The Batman was seemingly added to Batman: Arkham Knight. But the fun was fleeting because just a few hours later, the suit was removed.
Strangely, the suit, which first appeared in director Matt Reeve's 2022 The Batman, was only available in the Epic Games Store version of Arkham Knight, as noticed by GeekVibesNation on Twitter and verified by GameSpot; Game Informer was not able to check the game for the suit before it was removed.

At first, fans thought the suit was a well-made mod making the rounds online before more and more people realized it was actually added. As for why it was added, nobody knows, but Game Informer reached out to Warner Bros. Games to ask about the suit and will update this story if we learn more. 
The Batman suit joins a plethora of other movie suits already in Arkham Knight, like Michael Keaton's from the 1989 film, Batman, or Christian Bale's from The Dark Knight. Here's hoping The Batman suit returns soon because if screenshots players have captured are any indication, it fits right in with the dark Gotham of Arkham Knight. 
While we all wait to learn more, read Game Informer's reviews of Arkham Asylum, Arkham City, and Arkham Knight. After that, read Game Informer's Batman: Arkham Origins review, which is a game that just celebrated its 10-year anniversary this week.
