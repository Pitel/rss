        <updated>2022-01-30T21:52:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As previously announced, a new trailer for Paramount’s Halo TV series premiered today, giving us an even better look at the much-anticipated adaptation and a premier date. 
The show starts from the beginning, with Dr. Halsey (played by Natascha McElhon) selling the UNSC on Master Chief’s exceptional combat prowess but, most importantly, his ability to be controlled. But when Chief encounters an ancient artifact, he uncovers a plot that may require him to act independently in a manner that may rub his superiors the wrong way. 
The new trailer provides the first looks at the Covenant, specifically Elites, who look pretty accurate in the brief clips of them battling Master Chief. We also get a glimpse of the show’s more human-toned (and slightly unsettling) Cortana, who is still voiced by Jen Taylor. The biggest adjustment will be getting used to Chief’s new voice, with actor Pablo Schreiber bringing him to life. Lastly, we found out that Halo premieres exclusively on Paramount + on March 24.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Looking forward to the next Mario title, Platform Jumper.
Nintendo is starting off the year rather strongly on Switch, with exciting games to keep us busy towards Summer. Despite fierce opposition the Nintendo-distributed game at the top of this scribe's list is Triangle Strategy, which is coming to us thanks to Square Enix and continuing the visual style we first saw in Octopath Traveler. Yes, there are massive Pokémon and Kirby games too, but for fans of strategy games it's hard not to be ever-so-slightly impatient for a title that, to be honest, has a rubbish name.
To clarify, though the look and of course the leadership of Square Enix (especially through producer Tomoya Asano) in the projects are the same, Triangle Strategy and Octopath Traveler have different contributing development studios. With Octopath Traveler it was Acquire, whereas for Triangle Strategy it's Artdink. Both companies have a lot of experience and it makes sense that different teams would specialise in very different genres, but it's a reminder that Triangle Strategy is very much its own game and the link with its HD-2D predecessor is largely limited to the rather handsome graphics engine.

The Game Boy is an iconic piece of gaming hardware, but the quest to elevate and celebrate its games has continued over the course of more than 30 years. Backwards compatibility with the later Game Boy line enabled us all to replay the OG library on updated, improved screens and the quest to present 8-bit retro classics at their very best continues to this day.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Unlike Henry, it isn't bad.
Say what you will about Horrid Henry's suitability as a role model for youngsters, but there’s no denying the popularity of the franchise. Although there don’t appear to be any new books on the way anytime soon, the fact is they continue to sell well and its five-series animated spin-off now sits proudly on Netflix after years of strong British TV ratings. As such, while it may be easy to scoff at the idea of another Horrid Henry game (there were a couple of rubbish ones on the DS and Wii) the reality is a large number of parents are likely to buy it for their children. Thankfully, in this case, it isn’t necessarily going to be money poorly spent, because while Horrid Henry’s Krazy Karts is hardly going to have Mario glancing worriedly at his rear-view mirror, it’s actually a half-decent game, if lacking in content.
Rather than going down the Race With Ryan route and churning a children’s property into a bog-standard Mario Kart clone, Krazy Karts at least tries something different by switching to a side-on, 2D viewpoint that looks more like the NES Excitebike. Oddly, though, players can’t actually move up or down: karts are locked on a fixed plane and can only go forwards. Each lane has a series of obstacles to slow you down and a number of jumps which fling you into the air and require you to rotate so you can land cleanly without losing speed (think the Trials series). The racer who reaches the finish line first wins, simple.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After tackling Metroid in Season 1, the second season of Game Informer's Video Gameography podcast moves on to one of the biggest shooter franchises in existence: Halo. This week, we’re taking a look at the controversial Halo 5: Guardians, widely considered to be the most polarizing entry in the series. 
Halo 5: Guardians launched on the Xbox One on October 27, 2015, and was the tale of two Spartans. The campaign told a dual narrative centered on Master Chief and Jameson Locke, a soldier tasked with apprehending Chief after he goes AWOL to recover a rampant Cortana. Speaking of everyone’s favorite AI, her mission to subjugate the galaxy positions her as the main antagonist. Halo 5’s narrative didn’t universally land with fans and the game overall served as an unintentional poster child of the Xbox One’s flawed philosophy during its early years. How, you might ask? You’ll have to listen to find out.  
Join hosts Ben Reeves (@BenjaminReeves) and Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7) along with Wirecutter lead editor Arthur Gies (@aegies) as we unpack the history, impact, and lasting legacy of Halo 5: Guardians. 
Check out the rest of our podcast on the Video Gameography hub. If you'd like to get in touch with the Video Gameography podcast, you can email us at podcast@gameinformer.com.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We've been expecting you, Buddy Mission BOND.
Did you know that every year Nintendo publishes at least one new IP? It’s true, they haven’t missed a year since 1983, the year the Famicom launched in Japan. In 2020 we had Good Job!, Astral Chain in 2019, Sushi Striker in 2018 and Ever Oasis in 2017 — and that’s only naming one each year. Given how only a few of them ever hit a mainstream audience though (like 2019’s Ring Fit Adventure), it’s no surprise if they slipped your mind.
So what was Nintendo’s new IP last year? Well, assuming Game Builder Garage is actually a LABO spin-off and not it’s own unique series (seeing as it’s entirely based around the LABO Builder Garage), that honour goes to a game we think most people reading this article probably forgot all about until they saw the headline: Buddy Mission BOND.

When prompted by Kimmel, Charlie mentioned how he goes into a booth records lines by himself and doesn't really know much about the script at all - it's that secret.

It's been another interesting week in this Nintendo Life, culminating in a rather big release. Yes, Pokémon Legends: Arceus is out and is causing plenty of excitement; we enjoyed it a lot in our review. Though there were a good number of game announcements - particularly for the eShop - and it was also a week full of fun stories. An old translated interview taught us that Shigeru Miyamoto doesn't much like Navi, someone went to extreme lengths to get an 'impossible' arrow in BoTW, and someone played GTA on a Game Boy.
After all of that delightful gaming silliness it's time to chill out and discuss our weekend gaming plans. A few members of the Nintendo Life team have done just that below, so feel free to give our entries a read and then join in with your own via our comment section. Enjoy!

The same title - originally developed by Lobotomy Software (a team founded in 1993 by former Nintendo of America employees) - has now been locked in for a Switch eShop release and will arrive on 10th February for the price of $19.99 USD. Like the recent Shadow Man release, this new version of the game will also be powered by Nightdive's KEX Engine.

When I went hands-on with the game, all of Limgrave and Stormveil were open to me, including the haunting Weeping Penninsula to the south. But to the north of Stormveil lies another realm, a biome with a completely different aesthetic. Each realm in Elden Ring has its own signature set of creatures, flora, fauna, and more. The big boss of Stormveil, Godrick the Grafted, does not need to be beaten before moving on to the realm to the north, as a mildly hidden mountain path can lead players into this area without ever stepping foot inside the dangerous castle dungeon. 
This is the home of the magical academy of Raya Lucaria, and instead of the pastoral greens and rolling fields of Limgrave, it is draped in …]]></summary>

Access to Elden Ring’s hub realm, known as the Roundtable Hold, does not come right away when starting the game, though it may be possible to speed access given the player fulfills the right conditions. Sometimes when you come across a site of lost grace (checkpoints similar to bonfires in the Souls games) and rest, Melina will appear and offer some interesting words of guidance or commentary on the Lands Between.

Many have already seen Margit the Fell Omen, who punished players in the closed network test. During my hands-on time with the game, I had the chance to face off with Godrick the Grafted himself, the current lord of Stormveil, and a serious challenge, especially for an “early game” boss. Granted, you don’t have to fight Godrick at all to get to other adjacent zones to continue exploring and powering up, so my path to the many-appendaged tyrant was brisk. I didn’t really do a whole lot of leveling up or gear optimization because the clock was ticking during my 10-hour play session, and I wanted to see and do as much as possible. It…]]></summary>

However, there are also other boss battles located in both mid-tier dungeons and outside in the open world. While many players had a chance to take on a dragon in the Network Test, we encountered a new kind of open field boss in our time with Elden Ring, a ghostly mariner in the middle of a shallow lake. There’s no indication you will be entering a boss battle, other than fairly serious environmental clues. If you’re exploring organically, you may have also encountered the NPC “D” nearby, who hunts the undead and warns you that this small town has been beset by this ghostly fiend. Other than that, there’s just a big shallow lake…]]></summary>

Castle Mourne, nestled in southern Limgrave on the Weeping Penninsula, is a place where horrors abound. Chimeric leonine creatures and other surprises await the player should they dare approach. While this locale would fall into the mini-dungeon classification, it's substantially larger than any of the minor offerings that I experienced during my 10 hours of gameplay, with a dangerous approach and several checkpoints.

"Pokémon aren't real", they say. Well, I definitely saw an electric mouse the other day. Presumably, Pikachu wasn't created by chewing through wires like this one was, but still. (For legal purposes, this is a joke, and all the mice in my house are very much alive.)
But this recreation of hard-to-get Pokémon Spiritomb is almost as real as the actual creature itself. It's the creation of BigRig Creates on YouTube, a man who has a history of creating cool projects (like his steam-powered Poké Ball) and showing off cursed technology (like his McTable).

The characters involved were often crafted as humans, heroic but flawed in their journeys and adventures. However, as From Software took on the task of converting these characters to entities that would fit into Elden Ring, these mythic heroes and personalities got broken down into something twisted and more suited to occupying a “boss monster” role.
“When Martin wrote these characters, and when he provided that origin story that mythos for the world of Elden Ring, these demigods were much closer to their original form, and maybe closer to human form back then, before the Shattering, before it all …]]></summary>

I've played almost every mainline game, but I started losing momentum around the time of Sun and Moon. It just seemed so overwrought and complicated, with the introduction of regional forms, Ultra Beasts, and Z-Moves, plus X & Y's addition of Mega Evolutions, layered on top of the same old plot (team of grunts led by charismatic megalomaniac try to do a big evil thing, two legendary Pokémon are involved, etc.).

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/01/28/the-moonlight-greatsword-is-in-elden-ring-along-with-other-from-software-easter-eggs"/>
        <updated>2022-01-28T21:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Players that have been enjoying From Software’s last decade of action/RPG fare have discovered recurring characters, themes, and weaponry to be found in various forms across the games. While they don’t always make an explicit appearance, sometimes they’re found as shimmering surprises that delight (and terrify). This is the case during Ludwig’s phase two battle, where he decides to pull out the Moonlight Greatsword and attempt to dunk on the player with some incredibly flashy power moves. In Elden Ring, players will be able to interact with the duplicitous traitor Patches as well as acquire both the Storm Ruler and Moonlight Greatsword. 
“I can confidently say yes, this time. Elden Ring is the sort of game that forgives a massive sense of volume and bulk,” says game director Hidetaka Miyazaki. “And so I felt like I was entitled to include these things this time. So yes, you will find them if you look hard enough.”
Of course, with Elden Ring being a vast open-world full of secrets and exploration, it’s likely that some of these items will be tucked away and hidden behind mysteries. While we probably won’t be taking down a manta ray Storm King with the Storm Ruler this time around, since Patches will be there, it’s possible that some other pieces of King’s Field and From Software history will be around somewhere. Since we’ve seen multiple dragons as part of this world, it wouldn’t shock me to see something akin to Seath the Scaleless slithering around.

In the same conversion with Miyazaki, while we did get to see otherworldly areas like the Roundtable Hold, there won’t be any Painted Worlds in the game as he feels those are specifically a Dark Souls element. However, you can find paintings in the game all over – collectible objects that display a specific location in the world tied to the artist’s soul. While I didn’t get to track any of these locales down during my session, you can be sure that’s one of the first things on my list of things to do with the final game.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pay attention, Rowlet's talking.
One of the cool things in Pokémon Legends: Arceus is that you can just sort of... run around while your Pokémon do things. You don't have to babysit them; in fact, you don't even have to stand behind them in battle. It's weird how cool this feels.
You can also throw their Poké Balls on the ground to have them stand beside you for a little bit, doing a cute animation or two, and you can "Speak" to them to see how they're feeling. It's not as exciting as a Partner Pokémon, but it's sweet enough.

These oppressive poisonous swamp areas really got their stride in the Valley of Defilement all the way back in Demon’s Souls, but have continued to plague players to various degrees through the notorious Blighttown to other poisonous pits, caves, and muck. Speaking with Elden Ring game director Hidetaka Miyazaki, he relays that in this game, he rekindled his love for creating these horrific environments.
“In terms of how the player feels when they encounter this area that is a different story,” says Miyazaki. “But when making the game I rediscovered my love for making poison swamp…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The digital edition of the Elden Ring issue goes live tomorrow at 2 PM CST. At the exact same time, I’ll be heading to the official Game Informer Twitch channel to do a live discussion about everything we saw and played during our nearly 10 hours of hands-on time with From Software’s upcoming dark action RPG. While this obviously comes with a spoiler warning, even with our extensive play session, there are many, many secrets left to discover in Elden Ring – even with the marathon session, I feel like I’ve barely begun to scratch the surface of what Elden Ring has to offer. 
We’ll be talking about mechanics, features, gameplay, environments, and some other big surprises, but From Software has always been quite reserved in what they choose to show off early compared to what’s available in the final game – remember Bloodborne? No one was ready for where that journey would take us! So come hang out, chat, and ask your questions about Elden Ring. While I won’t be able to answer every question, I’ll do my best to facilitate some great conversations about what you can expect diving into Elden Ring. 
In addition to the stream, look forward to a deluge of coverage to hit GameInformer.com soon, including some exclusive video.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Through an entirely unplanned sequence of events, I'm currently playing two big action adventure games that couldn't be less alike. One is God Of War, a big, serious dadventure epic about an emotionally distant father trying his darnedest to connect with his (at times very irritating) son. The other is Kena: Bridge Of Spirits, an altogether more wholesome adventure about a young girl cleansing a lush, forested mountainside from a serious case of bad vibes and helping lost ghosts pass on to the other side. 
About the only thing they have in common is that they both have what one might call 'cute' NPC companions. Dad Of War is joined by his eager archer "BOY!" Atreus, while Kena has her gaggle of black, fluffy Rot friends (above, right). According to the widely accepted law of big googly-eyes, I should find the Rot absolutely adorable and thus beyond reproach. Atreus does not have big googly-eyes (they are merely wide and naive), but he is certainly a lot cuter than God Of War's other main companion, a talking disembodied head. And yet. Even though Atreus has now reached that stage where he's doing all his adolescent whining and rebellion and "I know you are, but what am I?" nonsense in the space of about two hours, I would much rather have this sulky pre-teen by my side than the interminable Rot. Let me explain.

The Elder Scrolls Online has received multiple expansions since its launch years ago and its next one has been announced. Titled Legacy of the Bretons, ZeniMax Online says it’s a “year-long saga” that will begin with "High Isle."

“We chose High Isle as the location for our next chapter because it’s a large departure from anything we’ve done over the last few years,” ESO creative director Rich Lambert writes in a new blog post. “High Isle is the epitome of the chivalric Breton culture – a resort-like island known for their nobility, with towering cliffs, pristine beaches, and loads of ancient ruins to explore.

“Firstly, this was an extremely tough decision, but we firmly believe it’s the right one to allow us to focus on our plans for the central free-roaming Adventure mode,” Rare writes in a blog post. “Despite the efforts of a hugely talented team, The Arena unfortunately never met the goals we originally had for it – either in creating a genuine alternative way to play Sea of Thieves with a competitive spin, or a short session experience if you didn’t have the tim…]]></summary>

The Nintendo Switch has a lot of strengths, but there's no getting around the fact that at nearly five years old the hardware is struggling to keep up with some third-party multiplatform games. That's no surprise, but there have now been a number of attempts to sell major releases to Nintendo fans as Cloud Versions.
Our reviews of cloud versions have had varied perspectives, as the positive of seeing high profile games on Switch is occasionally undermined by a disappointing streaming experience. Digital Foundry was prompted to review the offerings to date by the controversial Kingdom Hearts releases, which are high-priced and in some cases games that could arguably run on the hardware natively. The price is often a major sticking point for access to these streaming services; they are services, to be clear, you purchase a license to play for as long as the servers are still active.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you’ve been paying attention to Sega for the last couple of years, then you likely know that it has been slowly shuttering its massive Japan-based arcade centers. Now, Sega has announced that it is leaving the business of arcades entirely, ending a 50-year era defined by claw machines, fighters, and more. 
This news comes by way of Destructoid, which translated a statement released by Sega this morning. In it, the company reveals that it intends to sell the remaining 14.9% of shares it holds within its arcade division to another company named Genda Inc., which Destructoid reports is the same company that Sega has been selling its arcade centers to over the last few years. 
“Sega stores across the country will be switching their store names to GiGO, to express our gratitude for Sega’s 56 years of history and our desire to be an oasis that quenches people’s thirst for real entertainment,” Genda chairman Hisashi Kataoka said in regards to the news, according to Video Games Chronicle. “We will start with Ikebukuro, Akihabara, and Shinjuku. Then to the whole country.” 
The Sega branding on standing arcade centers will begin to be replaced by GiGO Entertainment branding. While Sega is leaving the business of owning and running arcade centers, don’t expect to see Sega arcade machines disappear. Destructoid reports that Sega still intends to produce arcade machines for worldwide distribution – you just won’t see them inside a large building with a massive Sega sign on it anymore. 
Of course, Sega is still in the business of making games, too, and this year, we’re expecting a new game starring everyone’s favorite blue blur in Sonic Frontiers. Check out the latest Sonic Frontiers trailer for a look at its open world and then read about how Sonic Frontiers was originally going to release in 2021 for the series’ 30th anniversary.

Pokémon Legends: Arceus is out on the Nintendo Switch, and we're celebrating by playing it live on stream starting at 12 p.m. CT only on Twitch! Join John Carson and Alex Stadnik as they traverse the realm of Hisui and show off all the new additions to the iconic series.

With Legends, Game Freak has taken the most significant series leap in quite some time, but did the risk pay off? Our own Brian Shea seems to think so. In his review, he said:
Catching as many Pokémon as you can, learning more about them, and training them to be stronger in battle are the very foundations of Game Freak's iconic RPG series, but few titles exemplify those core concepts as powerfully as this latest outing. Pokémon Legends: Arceus tasks you with exploring a bygone era of the Sinnoh region, then known as Hisui, and gives you more ways than ever to complete your Pokédex. While some elements don't feel like their final forms, I love where this new direction takes the Pokémon series.

We will be hopping into Alex's current save during today's stream and focusing on catching Pokémon and exploring the different biomes that make up Hisui. We will try to avoid story quests since he's pretty far into the game unless you want to see a mission or two, of course. To let us know what you want to see, be sure to join us in the Twitch chat, kick your feet up, and send the week off with a bang.

Fantastic game history archiving news, everybody! History of Hyrule, a prolific Zelda archivist, has just uploaded a high-quality scan of The Legend of Zelda: The Mirage Castle, a choose-your-own-adventure book from 1986, shortly after the release of the first Legend of Zelda game.
Because The Mirage Castle was released so long ago, it has a lot of weird and interesting Zelda lore that has since been scrubbed from the story, like a character called Fairy Fanny and Ganon's younger brother, Demon General Gaia. Zelda's father is a character we've met a few times over the last 30 years, but we've never known him as "King Graham II", as he's called in the book.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Anecdotally, the first records of modern golf date back to its banning in 15th century Scotland. “Nay Golf,” said parliament. “It’s turning the soldiers into fiendish, turf-snorting club-strokers who’d rather say shit like ‘Triple Bogey’ than batter the English, and we’re no having it.” RPGolf Legends is not set in 15th century Scotland, but it does take place in a world where golf has been banned. Only you - through the power of bare-bones ARPG combat and a fun but limited golf mini-game - can save the noble sport from ostensible nonexistence. 
I say ostensible because, in reality, golf is everywhere. Our heroine Aerin’s hometown is called Mulligandale. It has two shops, one of them dedicated entirely to golf. Folk shimmy about in golfwear, talking about golf. Many give out golf-related quests, the rewards for which are usually some form of golfing paraphernalia, often golf balls. The actual golf courses themselves have been sealed off by an ill-defined big villainous, but if you put a translucent barrier around the thing you’re trying to crush and still let the people you’re attempting to terrorise build their entire society as a monument to it, you’re basically asking for a plucky hero to restore the national passtime to glory. Highly questionable bit of villainy, this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft is shutting Hyper Scape down this year less than two years after its release. 
First revealed in the summer of 2020, and released shortly after its reveal as a free-to-play battle royale, Hyper Scape put players in a futuristic city to fight against 100 players in squads of three. To differentiate itself from just another battle royale, Hyper Scape attempted to do things a little differently. It kept loadouts small, traversal extremely fast-paced, and it even gave viewers on streaming platforms the ability to vote on in-game events that changed the ongoing match.

However, it wasn’t enough to keep the battle royale afloat and now, Ubisoft has announced that Hyper Space will be shutting down in a couple of months. 
blog post reads. “We set out to create a vertical, close-quarters, and fast-paced shooter experience and we are extremely grateful to our community for joining us on our journey. We will be taking key learnings from this game into future products.

To the Hyper Scape community, thank you for your passion and dedication to the world of Neo Arcadia both inside and outside the game. Your devotion to the game we built will always be cherished.” 

If you haven’t yet checked out Hyper Scape, maybe consider giving it a go before April 28. Regardless of how you might feel about the game, after April 28, it will be gone forever and an unplayable part of history.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in the mists of time of 2013, a bunch of Japanese developers got together to make a series of short 3DS games called the Guild series. Headed up by Ni No Kuni makers Level-5, it had some pretty big-name contributors: Keiji Inafune, Goichi Suda, Yoot Saito and Yasumi Matsuno among others. But there was one game that stood out to me as something really quite special. It was the considerably less well-known Millennium Kitchen's Attack Of The Friday Monsters, a sweet slice of life adventure that saw you play as ten-year-old Sohta walking the streets of his small Tokyo suburb on a hazy summer afternoon in 1971. It was a tender celebration of childhood nostalgia and imagination, with just an inkling of some menacing undertones, both from the people Sohta meets in his neighbourhood and the titular Friday kaiju monsters that may or may not exist in the real world. 
I mention all this because The Kids We Were is probably the only game I've played since then that's even come close to capturing some of that Attack Of The Friday Monsters magic. You won't find any kaiju here, but this is a similarly nostalgic portrait of pastoral Tokyo, as viewed through the eyes of young Minato on his summer holidays, first in the present day and then in the 1980s when he ends up travelling back in time Back To The Future-style to when his parents first met as kids. With three days to right past wrongs, this is one of those gentle, coming of age tales that leaves you feeling warm and fuzzy in all the right places, even when there's no real 'game' to speak of.

To make amends, Io Interactive are giving anyone who buys Hitman 3 on Steam before February 19th a free upgrade. If you buy the standard edition (£50/$60), you'll be bumped up to the Deluxe Edition (£75/$90). If you bought the Deluxe Edition, you'll get a free upgrade to the Seven Deadly Sins Collection (which on its own costs £23.73 with its 15% launch discount).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the biggest surprises of Fortnite Chapter 3 Season 1 is the inclusion of everyone’s favorite web-slinger, Spider-Man. Plus, everyone in the game can utilize his web-slinging abilities thanks to the web shooters item. Well, it seems Spider-Man’s existence in Fortnite has attracted one of his greatest foes to the battle royale because Green Goblin is now available in the Fortnite Item Shop. 
Now live, you can purchase the Green Goblin outfit to play as the infamous villain or you can purchase the entire Green Goblin set to be fully prepared to take down New York's, err, Fortnite Island’s masked menace. If you’re looking to be fully decked out with Green Goblin bling, though, here’s what you’ll find in the set: 
Pumpkin Bomb Back Bling (included with the outfit)
Pumpkin P’axe
Goblin Glider
Arm the Pumpkin! Emote
“Players can purchase the Outfit (plus Back Bling), Pickaxe, Glider, and Emote individually or as part of the Green Goblin Bundle,” Epic Games writes in a press release. “This bundle additionally includes the Attack of the Goblin Loading Screen.” 
If you haven’t yet unlocked the Spider-Man outfit, you can earn it by leveling up through the Fortnite Chapter 3 Season 1 Battle Pass. If green is more your style, you can embrace the goblin serum right now in the Fortnite Item Shop. 
For more about Fortnite, read about the new Pizza Party item now in the game and then check out what Hawkeye and Kate Bishop from Disney’s Hawkeye show look like in the battle royale. Check out Game Informer’s ongoing list of all the Marvel and DC superheroes and villains in Fortnite after that. 
Are you going to be picking up the Green Goblin outfit? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

However, it looks like Infinity is making a comeback thanks to a touching request by a concerned parent. 
Hello Games head Sean Murray took to Twitter to announce Joe Danger Infinity’s upcoming return, stating the reason is due to a letter he received from a fan. This person stated his child Jack, who has autism, adored the Joe Danger series and was particularly enamored with In…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It was revealed earlier this month that Kojima Productions’ Death Stranding Director’s Cut would be coming to PC sometime this Spring. Now, we know exactly when we can trek across North America once more with our BB on PC. 
505 Games, which is publishing the title on PC, has revealed that Death Stranding Director’s Cut will hit Steam and the Epic Games Store on Wednesday, March 30, 2022. It will cost $39.99, which is $10 more than it costs on PlayStation 5 where this edition of the game was first released. However, if you already own Death Stranding on PC, you’ll be able to upgrade for a much lower price. 
“Owners of Death Stranding can upgrade to the Director’s Cut for the discounted price of $9.99 by installing the current game and purchasing through the in-game storefront,” 505 Games writes in a press release. “Those who still need a copy of the base game can find it at a discounted rate of 70% off during Steam’s Lunar Sales (Thursday, January 27 through Thursday, February 3). 
As for what to expect, the Director’s Cut on PC brings higher frame rates, ultrawide monitor support, and a “feature-rich photo mode” to the game. 
“Death Stranding Director’s Cut on PC enhances the groundbreaking title with higher frame rates, ultrawide monitor support, and a stunning photo mode,” 505 Games says. “Thanks to the power of Intel’s new Xe Super Sampling (XeSS) graphics technology recently revealed at CES 2022, Death Stranding has never looked more hauntingly beautiful. Navigate a fractured world as Sam Bridges on a treacherous journey to reunite America, complete with an expanded storyline, new stealth missions, combat abilities, and more.” 
Death Stranding Director’s Cut will hit Steam and the Epic Games Store on March 30. While waiting for its release, read Game Informer’s original Death Stranding review and then read about why Death Stranding Director’s Cut is worth another trek across America.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Star Wars 1313 is basically a relic of the past now. It was first announced way back in 2012, and at E3 that year, we got a glimpse of what to expect in the Uncharted-esque bounty hunter title. It looked great, too. 
However, anyone familiar with the history of 1313 knows that 2012 was also the last year that we officially saw the title. Of course, gameplay and details from it have continued to leak over the years and today is another one of those days where we learn something new about it. That’s because new and unseen 1313 footage has leaked online, just a day after the latest episode of The Book of Boba Fett, no less, which held a surprise for Star Wars video game fans.

This time, the footage features Boba Fett chasing after some people on the advanced Jedi headquarters city of Coruscant, and like previous 1313 footage that’s leaked online, it’s clearly a work-in-progress, or rather, a snapshot of what was once a work-in-progress. It looks great, though!
It begins with a much more detailed Coruscant marketplace before Boba Fett gives chase, and it’s during this chase sequence we see a much-less detailed exterior of a Coruscant building. You can also see the Uncharted inspiration all over it, too, which isn’t surprising given that Uncharted 2 director Amy Hennig was attached to the game at one point. 
While it’s neat to see this unseen footage of a game that will never be, it definitely hurts because it looks fun. The same can be said for the Darth Maul game we’ll never get to play. You can watch some footage from that Darth Maul title for a taste of what we were in for. 
What would you rather see resurrected – 1313 or the Darth Maul game? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

And though it’s landing at an unusually busy time for game releases, this follow-up title is at the top of many fans’ most anticipated lists. Horizon Forbidden West appeared on our magazine cover in December, meaning we learned a ton of details about the game. So, there’s a lot to pack into this beefy round-up of everything you need to know before you start Aloy’s next journey. Let’s dive in.

In the meantime, Iron Galaxy does plan to hold a tech test on February 12 that PC players can participate in.

Rumbleverse debuted during The Game Awards 2021 and is a brawling-centric take on the battle royale. Players control customizable fighters that throw fists, swing steel chairs, and perform wrestling moves such as suplexes and elbow drops instead of using firearms. These grapplers can also scale buildings for added verticality. Rumbleverse is scheduled to launch on PlayStation and Xbox consoles and is an Epic Store exclusive on PC.]]></summary>

It’s about time. The women’s game of hockey is finally making its way to EA’s NHL series. The latest NHL 22 patch introduces playable women’s teams and full IIHF (International Ice Hockey Federation) rosters to the game, just in time to generate hype for the Winter Olympics in Beijing. This means you’ll be able to take the ice as some of the great icons making a name for themselves in the sport, from Team USA’s speedy Kendall Coyne-Schofield to Team Canada’s “Captain Clutch” Marie-Philip Poulin. 
This is a great moment for the women’s game, and the impact isn’t lost on the players. Marie-Philip Poulin said in an EA Sports press release that “It has been such a privilege to lace up my digital skates for the very first time in NHL
You can watch the trailer above to see elite talents, like Hilary Knight, Sarah Nurse, and Amanda Kessel, react to the news and further discuss its significance. While the trailer also provides our first look at these players on the virtual ice, it will be interesting to see how EA Vancouver represents the different style of play in women’s hockey, which relies less on the body and focuses more on stick play to separate players from the puck. There’s also more puck possession and chances to score in the women’s game. 
The update also makes the IIHF Men’s World Championship playable. EA confirmed sixteen international men’s teams and ten international women’s teams will be available for their respective World Championship modes alongside other popular destinations, such as Online Versus, Threes Now, and Shootout. The latest patch will go live shortly after the latest episode of EA Sports and Uninterrupted Canada’s five-part digital series Breaking Ice, which profiles champions of diversity in hockey.

We might kill a couple dozen zombies while we’re at it, too. 
Dying Light was released on January 27, 2015, and in many ways, it took gamers by surprise. It was a new entry in a franchise, which is exciting enough, but it was also released in a period of the year where not many games do. That’s not necessarily the case anymore, but that’s because Techland and Dying Light popularized (or at least strengthened the idea of) the January release, and they did so to great success.

The studio didn’t stop there, though, as it continued to support the game for years and years.  Just today, Techland announced that it’s giving away free weapon skins in honor of Dying Light’s seven-year anniversary. It seems it’s planning to give the same kind of support to its upcoming sequel because yesterday, Techland revealed its five-year DLC roadmap for Dying Light 2. 
There’s still a little over a week to go until we all get our hands on Dying Light 2, though, so for now, join us in playing Dying Light again. Game Informer editor John Carson will be behind the controls today, and he’s joined by fellow editor Marcus Stewart. They'll go live at 2 p.m. CT!

Neon Dynasty marks the first return to a fan-favorite plane in 20 years, but instead of working with the same tropes used back in the day, Kamigawa has received a bit of a glow-up.
Set in the present day, 1200 years after our previous visit, Kamigawa is now home to a cybernetic civilization full of robotics, body modifications, and of course, plenty of neon lights. It’s now Magic’s most high-tech plane, a Japanese-inspired cyberpunk realm that I never thought we’d ever see. However, the Kamigawa of old is not lost, as this advanced society lives in balance with the kami, spirits, and nature we know and love.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fans of 2000s platformers may remember Kao the Kangaroo. The punching marsupial first graced North American audiences in 2001 on Dreamcast, PC, and Game Boy Advance and starred in three subsequent titles in the following years. Though the series never reached the heights of a Crash Bandicoot or Ratchet & Clank, that hasn’t stopped Tate Multimedia from resurrecting the forgotten mascot for a brand new adventure.
Kao the Kangaroo is a brand-new title coming this summer that lets players jump, swing, climb, and pummel their way through a variety of colorful worlds. If you’ve caught yourself reminiscing about Kao asking, "wonder if they'll ever make a new one of those?" this is your day. Take a look at how Kao is being modernized in the trailer below.

Kao the Kangaroo doesn’t have a firm release date, but it’s coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC. It won’t be the only platformer from yesteryear making a comeback. Joe & Mac is also getting a remake which you can read about here.]]></summary>

It is, in fact, the most chaste dating sim I think I've ever played, while also managing to be the most obscenely graphic. You often hear games that straddle different genres accused of not knowing what they're trying to be. Sucker For Love does not suffer from this issue: it knows exactly what it wants to be. The challenge is for you, the hapless player, to keep the hell up.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practice in Singapore launched an investigation into Ubisoft Singapore last year following reports of harassment and workplace misconduct at the studio. TAFEP, which is a third-party agency, has concluded that these reports were handled appropriately by the studio, as reported by IGN. 
TAFEP says Ubisoft Singapore has a proper system in place to handle reports of harassment and workplace misconduct and that past reports were handled correctly. The agency also concluded that differences in pay are based on performance, in terms of experience and time at the company, rather than other biases. 
“We’ve put best practices in place at Ubisoft Singapore to ensure a safe, respectful, inclusive, and equitable workplace for every member of our team,” managing director Darryl Long said following the investigation’s conclusion, according to IGN. “We will continue striving to be an exemplary employer in Singapore and the region, one that attracts and retains the best talents and creates amazing games that enrich the lives of our players.” 
It’s important to note that employees at other Ubisoft studios have also voiced that they’ve experienced sexual misconduct, abusive leadership, and more at the company.

A humble beast, the inventory, yet a feature of many games - sometimes even a necessity. Often we only notice one if it's terrible. But boy, a good inventory is worth a dozen mules. So lets talk about them today!
In other news this week, Nate thinks he has come up with an original premise for a Pixar film, only to discover he has invented Seth Rogan's nightmare film Sausage Party, and we are officially starting our campaign to get Henry 'Vitamin H' Cavill on the show. We will be mentioning him every week from now on. Plus: what we like doing on our birthdays, school plays, and pro-wrestling adaptations of Dickens.

Fans of the first game are likely still in disbelief since the sequel struggled to break free from what appeared to be development hell. It's been seven years since the zombie-infested Haran was first introduced to the world, and Techland is ready to celebrate with its community as the sequel's release date grows closer. Dying Light's seven-year anniversary is kicking off with a set of free, flashy weapon skins.

The sleek wooden objects careen through the air in a perfect circle - in theory, at least - before returning right back to where they began in the palm of your hand. They’re something that fascinated me as a child, and 20-something years later I still don’t really know how or why they work.


Deflector is like someone taped two swords to a boomerang, Mad Max-style. How does the boomerang still operate with twin blades slashing back and forth on either end? Don’t know. How does it always circle its way back to where you’re standing after dashing around an arena filled with enemies? Not a clue.

Two Point Campus lets players build and run their own college campus from scratch. The success of your school depends on the performance of your students, which you influence by providing your personalized blend of courses and extracurricular activities. But since this is a Two Point game, everything has a humorous slant. Whether it’s offering robotics classes, hosting strange rat-themed sporting events, or designing unorthodox dormitories, Two Point Campus lets you build the silliest for-profit institution of your dreams. You can find inspiration on what to make by watching a brand-new trailer below.

You can find Two Point Campus on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. The game will also be available on Xbox Game Pass for console and PC. Pre-ordering rewards additional items such as a U-shaped Topiary and a literal Fountain of Knowledge/Pearl of Wisdom. Two Point Hospital owners who pre-order receive a varsity jacket and suit of armor to use in the Hospital. Nabbing a physical copy gets you the Enrollment Edition that includes a fold-out Campus map and University Prospectus.

To accompany the news, the studio released some new gameplay footage and screenshots from the PlayStation 4 version of the game. 
When a game goes gold, it means the version of the game being put onto discs has been finalized. However, as anyone that plays games today likely knows, Day One updates are quite a regular occurrence and while Forbidden West has gone gold, Guerilla is likely working on one for this title. That means that sure, when you pop in the disc on February 18, the game will be playable but Guerilla will likely want you to download that Day One patch for an even better launch day experience.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[According to a report by Deadline, the 2021 film reboot Mortal Kombat was successful enough to warrant a sequel.
Moon Knight lead writer Jeremy Slater has been tapped to write the script for Mortal Kombat 2. Slater has also been involved with the James Wan produced adaptation of Stephen King’s The Tommyknockers, and helped develop the graphic novel series The Umbrella Academy for Netflix. Outside of Slater’s involvement, not much is known about the greenlit Mortal Kombat 2 quite yet.
Mortal Kombat was released simultaneously in theaters and on HBO Max in April 2021, raking in $22.5 million its opening weekend, an impressive number in the early months of moviegoers returning to theaters during the ongoing pandemic. However, that strong start was a significant portion of the $83 million total it grossed worldwide after a sharp decline in the following weeks. The film stars Lewis Tan as series newcomer Cole Young along with, Jessica McNamee (Sonya Blade), Josh Lawson (Kano), Joe Talsim (Bi Han/Sub-Zero), Mehcad Brooks (Jax), and Hiroyuki Sanada (Scorpion).
Who do you want to see in the next Mortal Kombat film? Should Johnny Cage be introduced? Should there be a road trip to the other underrepresented realms? Let us know in the comments!.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The reviews for Pokémon Legends: Arceus have started to hit today, and if you haven't read Brian Shea's review yet, give it a look right here. Legends: Arceus is a significant change to the traditional Pokémon formula, which is a big deal for a series that hasn't strayed far from its roots in over 25 years. Instead of a fairly focused JRPG adventure, where you stroll from town to town, catching and building teams of Pokémon to challenge Gyms and eventually the Elite Four, Legends takes another route.
Legends: Arceus is very different, in fact. It lets trainers explore large open areas and catch monsters in the wild, a years-long dream of mine when thinking of the future of the series. I couldn't stop grinning when I first saw the player character sneaking up on an unsuspecting Wurmple and tossing a Pokéball at it. I had the same reaction when Game Freak showed you could start Pokémon battles by choosing which team member to toss out towards the target, just like Ash Ketchum would in the anime. Then I found out that gathering and crafting would be a big component of the game, and I was relieved the last few years of mastering a similar loop in Monster Hunter seems like it's going to pay off nicely. 
There's a whole host of notable changes potentially coming to the Pokémon series if Legends: Arceus is successful. So, let's talk about the experimental aspects packed into the newest Pokémon entry and whether they work or don't. I'd like to know what you think is the most influential change or new feature in Pokémon Legends: Arceus that you'd like to see in other mainline games moving forward? Is it the semi-open world, the seamless battle and catching mechanics? Will the Strong Style and Agile Style attack modifiers make it to competitive battles and warp that system entirely? Share your thoughts in the comments below.]]></summary>

Nathan Drake’s days of adventuring are over. As we watched him hang up his holster and rope to begin a new chapter in his life, Naughty Dog’s scribes doubled down on the message of “it’s over.” Video game protagonists rarely walk off into the sunset, but Drake’s farewell is as definitive as they come. Naughty Dog wrote Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End as a conclusion to Drake’s story, and it ended on a poetic and satisfying note. To bring him back in starring role would be foolish. It really is over. Is Drake’s name synonymous with Uncharted? He’s wonderfully charismatic and endearing, but we now know he isn’t the lifeblood of i…]]></summary>

Whether you duel on the regular or are dusting off the deck for the first time in years, pouring your heart and soul into constructing a deck and pitting it against a stranger online is surprisingly nerve-wracking. What if my card synergy isn’t any good? Is my opponent snickering at me because my cards aren’t up to the hottest meta? What if … I lose? That fear can be surprisingly crippling and prevent you from enjoying the best aspect of the game: testing your skills against fellow duelists. Even worse, it keeps you from getting better.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Valve wasn't joking a few weeks ago when it said that its upcoming handheld Steam Deck was going to hit current shipping targets. Today, the company announced the first batch of Steam Decks will start to be sold to customers on February 25 and sent out shortly after.
More specifically, Valve plans to send out emails to those lucky early reservation holders starting on February 25. From there, customers will have 72 hours to respond and confirm the purchase. If that process proceeds smoothly, a shiny new Steam Deck will be delivered to its new home starting on February 28. Steam Decks held for those who fail to complete the purchase within that three-day period will be available for the next reservation in line. Valve did make it clear that the model that you reserved is locked in as the one you'll have the opportunity to buy. There won't be a way to switch when the confirmation email comes through. 
Make sure to keep an eye on your inbox if you think you'll be eligible to buy the device close to launch. Valve says it plans "to release new order email batches on a weekly cadence." 
For those interested in how the Steam Deck handles, the same announcement came with some information regarding coverage and reviews. According to Valve, hardware review units will be sent to outlets shortly, and the embargo for final verdicts will also be on February 25. Considering the 72-hour grace period on confirming a purchase, this at least gives potential buyers the chance to inform themselves a little more before pulling the trigger on picking up the anticipated handheld PC. Other preview information may be allowed before the review embargo, but there are no specifics as to what or when.
If you have the Steam Deck reserved, but don't know where you are in line, check out the Steam Deck page in the Steam client or website.

The Grim Reaper’s scythe rarely falls upon treasure hunters. The earth collapses beneath their feet, arrows fly from walls, and giant boulders give chase, but these adventurous souls cannot be stopped until they locate an ancient secret. Their expeditions are brimming with rollicking fun, but their stories always end the same way: They live another day, and one less treasure is lost to the world. We know what we’re getting from these serialized stories, and we love them for it.

Techland has revealed that it has a five-year roadmap for the first-person zombie parkour game, meaning you’ll be receiving new DLC for it until at least 2027. While that’s quite surprising to learn, fans of Techland’s first Dying Light game are likely already familiar with the studio’s DLC commitments. 
As you can see in the image above, the first bit of DLC will launch in February alongside free Factions-inspired content. Then, sometime in March, Techland will release its first set of Dying Light 2 challenges, followed by a series of events featuring mutated infected in April. Fast forward to May, and you’re looking at another set of challenges coming to the game. Then in June, you can expect the first paid story DLC. 
The five-plus years of support include the following, according to Techland:
A second story DLC
New weapons
New enemies
New stories
New events
New free and paid DLCs
Dying Light 2 hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on February 4. It will hit Switch later since that version was delayed.
While waiting for its release, read about how Dying Light 2’s main story will last about 20 hours (although completing every single thing in it will take upwards of 500 hours), and then check out how that 500-hour length compares to other notoriously long games.

Not only did it review well back when it was officially released in December – Game Informer gave it a 9.25 out of 10 – but many people played it. A quick scroll through Twitter would have told you that, but thanks to Microsoft’s second-quarter earnings call, we now know just how much. 
Video Games Chronicle reports that Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, who is likely still riding the high of acquiring Activision Blizzard, said more than 20 million players have played halo Infinite. Halo Infinite’s multiplayer was launched as a beta back in November before the campaign was released on December 8 on Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC (and on Xbox and PC Game Pass as well).

That’s not all, though, as Nadella also revealed that Forza Horizon 5, the latest arcade racer from Playground Games, has been played by more than 18 million players since its release on Xbox consoles and PC last November. 
“The big bets we have made across content, community, and cloud over the past few years are paying off,” Nadella said, according to VGC. “We saw record engagement as well as revenue this quarter. Game Pass has more than 25 million subscribers across PC and console. We released AAA titles this holiday to rave reviews and record usage. Eighteen million played Forza Horizon 5 and more than 20 million have played Halo Infinite, making it the biggest Halo launch in history.”

Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection is out on Friday, and it features remastered versions of Uncharted 4 and Lost Legacy optimized for PlayStation 5. Honestly, I don't know if we really need this collection of games yet – the originals are roughly five years old and are still gorgeous – but being able to play them again in 60 frames per second on the PS5 is an absolute treat. We're showing off the second mission from Uncharted 4, my favorite game in the series, which takes place in a prison on the coast of Panama.
Please note the below Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection gameplay was captured internally on PlayStation 5 via Performance Mode.

Our Past Uncharted Reviews:
Uncharted 4:
"A Thief End’s is the best Uncharted yet, delivering a story I didn’t want to end, and an adventure that concludes with a hell of a payoff. The “wow” factor of the world exploding under Drake’s feet has diminished in the years following Uncharted 2, but those moments are still effective, and a true showpiece of the developer’s exquisite craftsmanship for world and gameplay design. All four of Naughty Dog’s games culminate in A Thief's End in a fitting and cohesive way that fans should appreciate." – Andrew Reiner

Read the full review.

Uncharted: The Lost Legacy:
"Given just how fully featured this adventure is, Lost Legacy could have easily been Uncharted 5. Where Naughty Dog goes next is anyone’s guess, but I would love to see Chloe and Nadine return for another hunt, as they’re every bit as engaging as the Drake family. They make a hell of a team." – Andrew Reiner

        <updated>2022-01-26T17:15:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week's The Book of Boba Fett episode is loaded with surprises and will surely delight fans who consume all of Star Wars' movies, shows, comics, books, and even video games. The focus of this article is just one of the surprises, which is relatively small compared to others in the episode, but still warrants a big SPOILER warning. I urge you all to watch the episode before continuing on, but if you have no interest in the show, or want to see if the surprise will make you watch, continue on.
It's been a big week for Respawn Entertainment. Yesterday, the developer announced three new Star Wars video game projects are in the works, including a follow-up to 2019's excellent Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. The star of that game is Cal Kestis, a Jedi in training who just happens to befriend a little droid named BD-1. This new BD droid type was created by Respawn Entertainment and Lucasfilm and has since emerged in other Star Wars stories, including an issue of the Doctor Aphra comic book.
In the fifth episode of The Book of Boba Fett, we get our first look at a BD unit in a live-action show and it's as adorable and animated as in the game. This particular droid may be BD-1 and could point to a Cal Kestis cameo or appearance in a future episode or forthcoming Star Wars project.
You can see the BD droid of note below. It definitely looks like it's seen some action and is fairly old. What do you think of the cameo? Do you think it's BD-1 or just a random BD unit?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In 2009, From Software released Demon’s Souls, a game that would go on to be a precursor to a new subgenre of games. Since then, From Software and visionary game director Hidetaka Miyazaki have produced gem after gem, serving up dense atmospheric worlds, brutal challenges, enthralling environments, and incredible triumphs for players to experience. From the horrific nightmares of Bloodborne to the tranquil cherry blossoms of Sekiro, From Software has masterfully applied its core framework of systems to a variety of compelling adventures.
In Elden Ring, From Software’s creation culminates with an absolutely huge open world to explore, with design decisions and features learned from over a decade of honing dark fantasy action/RPG fare. With around 10 hours of hands-on gameplay with Elden Rin…]]></summary>

        <updated>2022-01-26T16:40:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Who isn’t excited for Elden Ring? I mean, the Soulsborne enthusiast himself, Dan Tack, claimed that FromSoftware’s upcoming fantastical RPG will likely be 2022’s GOTY – and that’s just based on the various trailers and his experience with hands-on preview builds! But how long will players be exploring this alleged possible-GOTY sandbox? Well, according to a PCGamesN report, Elden Ring’s mainline story will take around 30 hours to beat, with side content adding in dozens more. Of course, it’s probably safe to throw another ten to twenty hours of “you died” overlays to that runtime, too. 
At the Taipei Game Show, Elden Ring producer Yasuhiro Kitao stated, “This will differ significantly by player, but in terms of the targets set during development, the idea is that the main route should be able to be completed within around 30 hours.” Kitao would later go on to say, “The game as a whole is quite massive, and contains many dozens more hours worth of gameplay, but if we are talking about the main route only, it shouldn’t take much longer than that.” 
I, for one, am happy that Elden Ring won’t be an overwhelming time sink – the notorious loop will likely be punishing enough to keep most players occupied well into the 50-hour range. PCGamesN notes that Elden Ring’s manageable scope mirrors From Software’s other titles. Apparently, Dark Souls and Dark Souls 2 take a little over 40 hours to beat, while the third entry clocks in at around 32 hours. Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice is the shortest game, with a less-than-30-hour runtime. 
Elden Ring launches on February 28 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. If you are looking for a time sink, consider Dying Light 2 Stay Human, as it supposedly takes at least 500 hours to achieve 100% completion.

He has no time for the posh dark elf who applauds him for something. Whatever it is, Jack doesn't care. In fact, I don't think he knows where he is. If he does, he wants nothing to with it.
This interaction is contained in a new trailer that I deem to be perfect. It sells me on this Final Fantasy action RPG, because it seems like I'll get to control someone as impatient as I am. Jack lives for crashing and bashing. The story is an inconvenience for him, the fighting is not.

Today they confirmed they're returning to their supersuit FPS with a new instalment they claim will be "a truly next-gen shooter." They're not clear about what next-gen means to them. Will Crysis 4: a) require a £1500 graphics card; b) be a battle royale; or c) sell NFT hats on the metaverse blockchain cryptonet? Answers on a postcard, reader dear.

The group calling themselves the Game Workers Alliance will now have to hit up the National Labor Relations Board and run elections, but say they're still confident about unionising because, y'know, they have the support of a supermajority. "Once again, when management is given a choice, they always seem to take the low road," the group said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Although announcing three games at once feels a bit much, I'm really happy about the Respawn feat. Star Wars news. Respawn Entertainment always felt like one of those development studios that should have been shut down by a bigger studio circa 2015 because the people loved Titanfall but it wasn't, you know, Call Of Duty or anything. I turned my back for what seemed like but a moment, and suddenly Apex Legends exists and Respawn are one of the key players under EA, growing stronger from within. One day we'll be watching Andrew Wilson at an E3 showcase and realise it's actually Vince Zampella's eyes looking out at us. Everyone coming on stage to present is just Vince Zampella doing a voice and wearing a different baseball cap.
Point is, I'm mostly just pleased that Respawn are still around to make games featuring robots that surprise and delight us. And if they're not allowed to do Titanfall 3, Star Wars is at least a rich field to till said robots. Lousy with robots, is Star Wars. But honestly, if anyone is going to make Star Wars games (apart from BioWare, who have spent recent years making Dragon Age 4 and / or collapsing like a magnificent neutron star) then I'd root for Respawn. They may not make the Star Wars games you think you want, but they'll make the ones you need right now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After six long weeks, Final Fantasy XIV is back on sale. That's after Square Enix stopped selling the MMORPG after the critically acclaimed life-hog overwhelmed its servers, causing massive server queues and network errors. Thankfully, those days are behind the game now. So yes, if you've been longing to check out its excellent Endwalker expansion or famous smooth grapes, you can! And from a new Oceania server too, because Squeenix now have room for those down under to sample Eorzea's delicacies.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There was cause for joy and concern alike when Intel revealed the Core i5-12400F, alongside loads of other new 12th gen Alder Lake CPUs. Here was a much more affordable, still gaming focused-alternative to the Core i5-12600K, yet it would lack the signature hybrid of fast Performance cores and flexible Efficiency cores that made that chip one of the best gaming CPUs ever made. 


Turns out, the concern was for naught: the Core i5-12400F is a cracking slice of silicon, both for the money and for games specifically. Although the sole reliance on Performance cores (or P-cores) puts it behind the Core i5-12600K for desktop multitasking, if it’s just the frames per second you’re after, this cheaper chip can match and sometimes even surpass its big brother.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Firework actually came out almost exactly a year ago, but the English language version (translated from the original Chinese) was released just before Christmas. Which is a good thing, because Firework is well worth checking out if you have an interest in either horror games or puzzle games. The horror isn't blood-chilling, but rather twisted up with grief and sorrow in how inevitable it is. Similarly, the puzzles aren't going to stump you for long, but they fit very well with the story. These two strands of the game weave together and create a nice, thoughtful experience that's worth the four or so hours of having it.

Long enough to feel substantial, but not too long that it'll feel like a massive slog. No bloat, more riding on spectral horse-goat, as they say.

Please make a game that is basically Strange Horticulture, but about a weird book shop. Possibly a book shop with a small coffee shop attached. I'm not going to be too strict about it, you know, I'm not a monster. It could, for example, be a library. Or maybe there isn't another business attached, or the business attached to it is a bakery instead of a coffee shop. This isn't just my personal hobby horse, either. I'm pretty sure loads of people would like that game. And please, for the love of God, tell me if the Mystery Book Shop Game already exists. I'd be disappointed if it does, because nobody has yet brought it to my attention.

The team at Blackbird Interactive has watched the recent return of the classic RTS games with interest - vested interest, in fact. Tasked by Korean developer Smilegate with transposing their Counter-Strike-style shooter Crossfire to the strategy genre, Blackbird believes it has identified a hole yet to be filled. A nostalgic need to be catered to.
“I argue that in the recent resurgence, we haven’t yet come across an RTS game that offers players an experience comparable to StarCraft or Red Alert,” says game designer Maurice Grela. “We’re hoping to fulfill that gap.”

It seems an obvious scam, which can't be good for the game's image.

Over the years, I’ve even formed my own little plan. Loot some local houses and then set up a base in the fire station on my street. They’ve got electric gates and metal fences to guard the perimeter, a renewable power source thanks to a wind turbine on the roof, and a really handy watchtower. I thought 11 years of The Walking Dead would’ve prepared me fairly well and I fancied my chances. So, I made myself in Project Zomboid. It turns out, everything I learned from The Walking Dead was useless.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pupperazzi is a game about taking pictures of dogs. They are, as is traditional, very cute dogs. You go around several areas that increase in complexity and dog saturation, completing photo challenges and unlocking more and more complex areas. An extreme sports dog wants a picture of a dog riding a scooter. The old sea-dog at the beach would like a photo of any dog, as long as the lighthouse is in the background. In return for this you get golden bones as a form of currency to buy different kinds of film, or weird lenses, to kick your photography into the next gear.
It's cute. It's a really nice playground that facilitates the player's own creativity. You can pet dogs to make them happy, or find toys to make them do different things: turn on a radio and any furry pals nearby bust out some truly astonishing moves; throw a stick to initiate a huge game of fetch. You post your photos to a kind of dog-centric Instagram for likes and comments (possibly from dogs; possibly from humans). The colourful, chunky art, combined with deliberately stiff animation where nobody can move their joints, really reminds me of Playmobil toys. Despite this carefree, playful tone, I also find it unaccountably sinister.

Perhaps some taxonomy would help. Moons Of Ardan is a space colony building game that's mostly about balancing production rates by placing buildings. Less dryly, you're making a new home for mildly cute little space people on semi-cartoony worlds, where nothing ever really goes wrong and... the vibes. It's the vibes, you see.

Sometimes it's an exciting early glimpse, sometimes it feels like supporting a developer or game you care about, and sometimes it can feel more like paying to beta test. That last one won't be a concern with Blood Bowl 3, not anymore. The latest adaptation of Games Workshop's tabletop fantasy bloodsport was headed to early access but now, naw. The developers are focusing on closed beta testing instead, and will simply launch the game in full once it's done.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dunno if you’ve noticed, but there’s been a whole lot of news lately. Too much news in fact. Growing up, we barely had any news. There was just one bit of news that we’d all have to share. A man would drive around our village with the news in the back of his van, and we’d all come out of our houses to watch as he slid open the doors and pointed at it, saying “well, here is the news”. And it was the same news, every day. The news about the hole in the ozone layer. And it was all the news we needed.


Not For Broadcast puts you in charge of all of the news. Set in an alternate timeline 1980s Britain in which an authoritarian far-left party has swept to power on a wave of populist policies, it casts the player as the lens through which the nation will view its new government. Seated in front of a bank of glowing screens, sliders and controls, you have the enviable power to switch between four live camera feeds, bleep out naughty words (and later subversive opinion), choose which ads to run during the break, and select which images are highlighted on screen during each news story.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ah, to be good with plants. Apparently it was a thing, wasn't it, that my generation all got into house plants, especially during lockdown. A friend of mine has a positively ebullient front room full of lush, green darlings that have names like Hercules. My brother-in-law, absent any real space, has mounted glass spheres of water on his wall and grows little flowers and trailing vines from them. I, on the other hand, am a plant killer. Apart from in Strange Horticulture, when I run a spooky and ethereal plant shop in a town called Undermere, in an alternate-universe version of The Lake District. There, my plants are happy and weird, and with them I can save the world.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Strategy games set in space are almost innately ambitious. The very concept of doing anything meaningful in an infinite void, let alone making it playable and entertaining, is a challenging one, and for every game that reaches for the stars there are countless kinds of... spiraling chaos orbitals.
Between its design flaws and unique ideas with semi-brilliant execution, the 2010 4X/wargame/economic/management simulation Distant Worlds: Universe has straddled those two experiences for a decade. It's needed a sequel for a long time. Distant Worlds 2 is that sequel, and it's almost upon us. Last week I attended a live demo and Q&A session with its producer and co-designer Erik Rutins. With only a hands-off demo to go on I obviously can't say for sure how it plays yet, but it's already looking very promising.

Looking ahead, they've also revealed the much-requested new scoreboard which will arrive in February. After a few months, maybe the game will get to the state it should have been in when it launch in November.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We’re in a bit of a “love letter” media period right now. Some old things come back with new things to say, like The Matrix Resurrections, and some old things come back simply to enjoy themselves, and remind yesteryear fans what they loved about the original in the first place, like Scream. 


Windjammers 2 falls firmly into the latter category. After successfully resurrecting Streets Of Rage for another bout in 2020, developer Dotemu are up to the same old tricks, bringing Windjammers all the way back from 1994 (before I was even born) with a fresh coat of paint and some brand new ultimate frisbee-style action in this sequel.

I would say Happy New Year, but it's already the 19th January and we've had two of the biggest news stories of the year in the space of a week, so I think that means it's officially too late to keep banging the old New Year drum, isn't it? The sentiment remains, of course, even if I do now feel a thousand years old in the process.
Rather than reaching for the annual reset button, though, today I wanted to talk about some of the new and exciting things that are coming up on RPS this year. For starters, our tech team's just handed us a brand-new liveblogging feature, and we'd like you, our RPS supporters, to help us test it out tomorrow at 4pm GMT.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you're after a way to make your magic system seem cutesy yet different at the same time, music is a good one to go for. Sure, it's been done before, but it feels inherently charming. At least, it does in the trailer for newly-revealed Songs Of Glimmerwick, a new game from Eastshade Studios that promises to blend RPG, adventure, and gardening.
No specific release date is confirmed, aside from "next year". I have to give them credit for the name Songs Of Glimmerwick, which immediately lets you know that this will be about music and magic, and probably have an amount of tweeness. Specific tweeness levels unconfirmed but they're looking good from the trailer, where you can also clap eyes on some pretty cool-looking gardening, a tree telling you to stfu, and a man earnestly giving you a wooden flute as you head off to magic university.

In this case, it's a Russian bootleg copy of The Simpsons Hit & Run which we're admiring, mainly because the bootlegger has dubbed every character in every cutscene.

The Wall Street Journal claim someone told them that Actiblizz CEO Bobby Kotick wanted to 'change the narrative' around the company following many allegations of discrimination and harassment, and he thought that one way to do that was buying some of the video games media, such as Kotaku or cheery RPS fanzine PC Gamer. Oh that would change the narrative alright!

There’s a joke there about him stepping down but the Chaos having remained, but I can’t figure it out. Anyway, what I’m trying to say is this: it’s been almost seven years since then. SEVEN! And I’m still head over heels in love with these games even now. Somehow, impossibly, that seems to be holding true for Warhammer 3 as well.
In a recent hands-on event, I was able to play something like eight hours worth of this final game in the trilogy from the comfort of my own spare room. Having not done a “digital preview” before now, this was something of a revelation to me. Wearing my comfortable clothes and with a steady supply of big mugs of tea, I booted up the game, hit ‘New Campaign’ and was greeted with the following screen.
