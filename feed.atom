In addition to making it easier for copyright holders to disable access to identified infringing content at the ISP level, similar powers will enable urgent and precautionary blocking even before an infringement takes place.

Capcom also released its earnings report yesterday - recording another year of record sales and profits. Along with this sales update, it also mentioned how it planned to release "multiple major new titles" by March 31, 2023.
While only a small amount of these games are currently locked in for the Nintendo Switch, at the very least it provides an outline of what we can expect from Capcom for the next year. It'll be focused on plenty of heavy-hitters - one potentially being Street Fighter 6, and some new IP like Exoprimal.

Rogue Legacy 2 doesn’t make the biggest initial splash. In fact, at first glance, you’d be hard-pressed to see what’s changed from 2013’s Rogue Legacy to Cellar Door Games’ sequel. Despite switching from 2D sprites to a 3D rendered world, it veers close to the previous game’s aesthetic.

Over the past two decades NVIDIA has offered great Linux driver support with their proprietary driver stack, but with the success of AMD's open-source driver effort going on for more than a decade, many have been calling for NVIDIA to open up their drivers. Their user-space software is remaining closed-source but as of today they have formally opened up their Linux GPU kernel modules and will be maintaining it moving forward.

OMOCAT's highly-anticipated Switch port of its horror RPG, Omori, was one of the featured games during Japan's Indie World showcase. And the presentation also confirmed an official release date for the game — 17th June!
While we initially reported that the game's physical edition would be shipping out on the same day, it seems that the eShop has also been updated with this June date, meaning we've got just over a month until we can dive into this sketch aesthetic turn-based RPG.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you’re a fan of classic Chucks, or someone who’s always wanted shoes emblazoned with your favorite pocket monster on them, then you’re in luck because Pokémon and Converse are teaming up again to do just that. 
Back in January, Converse released a line of shoes that featured Jigglypuff, Meowth, Squirtle, and more, and now, the company has announced its next line of Pokémon shoes, as reported by Kotaku. This time, the iconic Chucks highlight a single Pokémon on each pair. There are Pikachu shoes, Eevee shoes, Charizard shoes, and Mewtwo shoes, and all four pairs look amazing. 

As you can see in the images above, the shoes are designed to match the main color of each Pokémon they represent – the Pikachu shoes are bright yellow, the Eevee shoes a tan-ish brown, the Charizard pair are fire-type orange, and the Mewtwo chucks are a stylish and subdued pink-ish purple. Unfortunately, all signs point to this drop being exclusive to Japan. 
First off, they only seem to be available on Converse’s Japan website, with all four pairs expected to go live this week for roughly $75. There’s also the fact that the shoes feature the Japanese nomenclature of each Pokémon’s name, which is why the Charizard shoes say Lizardon. However, that might just be a styling decision so perhaps there’s a chance that these shoes make their way over to the West sometime in the future. For now, though, it seems you’ll need to navigate the Converse Japan site to secure a pair (or four pairs) of your own. 
In the meantime, check out the most recent Pokémon x Converse team-up and then read about the reveal of Pokémon Violet and Pokémon Scarlet after that.

And then we followed up with the centrepiece of our celebrations — a real labour of love from one of NL's resident senior video producers, Mr Zion Grassl. His hour-long video — 'The MOTHER We Share: Our EarthBound Story' — featured a whole bunch of luminary EarthBound fans (including one Toby Fox, creator of Undertale) in an exploration of why the series means so much to many gamers. It's really something and definitely worth checking out if you haven't already.

While that’s true, what’s at the heart of the Halo franchise does not change – it’s Master Chief, Cortana, some punchy guns that don’t get old, and a soundtrack that never lets up. Throughout the decades, Chief and Cortana (and buddies like Buck) have found themselves on Earth, Sanghelios, hurtling through space, aboard exploding rings, and more. But no matter the locale, we were finishing the fight – even when some of those battles were more grueling than others.
Sadly, Chief was absent from the fight the Game Informer editors partook in to rank all the Halo games from worst to best. It’s important to note that we opted to rank only the Xbox console FPS Halo games, which means you won’t find mobile, arcade, or RTS spinoffs like Halo Wars or Fireteam Ra…]]></summary>

It's one of those games that's perfect for Game Pass, at least in its current form, but that's going to be changing in a small bit, according to a post devs Straka Studio made yesterday. Straka note they are a small team who playtested with a very small group, and didn't realise the game would be unwelcoming to newcomers. In fact, they've already made some smaller tweaks to the game that have made quite a difference, but the most notable problem players raised was the lack of any, umm, loot?

Mario has seen his fair share of locale over the years, from the tropical paradise of Isle Delfino to the bustling streets of New Donk City, and even... well, outer space. With not an ounce of fear in his heart, our favourite plumber takes to new challenges with gusto, but do we think he would last in Elden Ring's vast and deadly world of 'The Lands Between'?
Well, if we're to take a recent tweet from user @Lucky_BunTTV seriously, Mario may well feel quite at home in Elden Ring's world, as it bears a remarkable resemblance to 'Dinosaur Land' seen in the iconic SNES platformer, Super Mario World.

Next month, we can run off to our favorite Lego supplier to grab an Optimus Prime Lego set. We don't know what it looks like yet, how many pieces are in the box, or how much it will cost, but it's OPTIMUS PRIME! None of that stuff matters. This will likely be a no-brainer purchase for Transformers fans. Here's Lego's official teaser announcement:
Begin the epic build. #LEGO #Transformers #OptimusPrime pic.twitter.com/rjdQbdej43
May 11, 2022
Lego is kicking of Transformers' reign in Lego the right way: with the leader of the Autobots. If this product flies off of shelves (which it likely will), I'd love to see more Transformers get the brick treatment. Megatron would likely be the second set, and what comes next is anyone's guess. Grimlock, Bumblebee, Soundwave, and Starscream are a handful of characters that probably wouldn't be far off.
I'm guessing the brilliant minds at Lego have figured out how to use all of the pieces in the box for two transformations: the robot form and the vehicle. Some Lego sets that already exist use the same pieces for three different builds (meaning we could get some triple changers!)
What do you think of Transformers moving on from Kre-O brick building to Lego? Which characters or action sets would you like to see next?
I'm an avid Lego collector and builder. The only thing that may scare me off of this set is if it is based on the Transformers films. I'm hoping Lego goes with a Generation 1 design, which debuted in the 1980s era cartoon.]]></summary>

Electronic Arts (EA) shared its investor presentation this Tuesday, which is used to tantalise investors and make sure they stay on board for the next financial year. And this year's presentation has a few juicy morsels, one of which reveals that EA is working on a Remake for the end of 2023.
We already know EA is publishing the upcoming Dead Space remake, so this is likely to be something brand new. EA has a huge library of games that it has published or developed, of course, so it could be absolutely anything. Ignoring that 2012 reboot, though, perhaps a remake of SSX or its incredible sequel, SSX Tricky, could be on the cards? Or maybe it's time for Def Jam Vendetta to make a comeback.

During today's Indie World showcase, Swedish developer Landfall made an appearance to announce that its hit wobbler-based strategy game, Totally Accurate Battle Simulator, will flail its way onto the Switch this summer.
Often called TABS, this goofy battle sim is meant to capture the feeling of playing with action figures as a kid, and the ragdoll physics radiate the kind of joy you might exude when playing out fake battles with you and your sibling's toys.

This isn't really one of those times, because I think I'd be recommending Songs Of Conquest overall as it is anyway. Giving it an estimated year for Lavapotion to "figure out, together with the community, what features we should prioritize" could well push me into a wholehearted endorsement, though.

MiHoYo announced the delay on Twitter last week due to “project progress”, but promised to issue Travelers with complimentary goodies every week until the launch of update 2.7. They don’t clarify when that update will be though. More info is in the full statement on MiHoYo’s site.

As is the norm, today's Indie World showcase had quite a few 'out today' reveals, and one of them was Soundfall. Developed by Drastic Games, it looks rather intriguing, as it'll blend action looter play with rhythm-based mechanics.
The trailer gives a good flavour of the gameplay, and impressively it'll have a huge library of songs that should give it plenty of variety - some official details are below.

Indie developer NamaTakahashi has revealed that his NES-inspired puzzle-platformer ElecHead is coming to Switch this summer! The game was shown off during the latest Indie World presentation, where a little robot called Elec must bright light back to the world.
The little fella is absolutely adorable, and the game looks utterly charming. Wherever Elec walks, the platform lights up, meaning the section goes from a blue-ish grey to a sunny yellow. The game has been out on Steam and itch.io since last October, and our friends at Eurogamer heaped praise on it last year in their review, where writer Christian Donlan said that "ElecHead is supremely clever, then, but it's also always more than just clever. It's fantastic, basically." And it looks the part, too:

However, that’s where the known quantities end, save for the next EA Sports PGA Tour which was delayed to early 2023, because Quarter 4, which encompasses the January 2023 to March 2023 time period, contains four unknowns: Major IP, Partner Title, Remake, and Sports Title. 
EA notes on the slide that these four titles scheduled for Q4 of the 2023 Fiscal Year “have not yet been publicly disclosed,” which is why the names of those games aren’t listed on the slide. However, those unknowns have us thinking, and theorizing, what they might be.

Here’s everything announced during today’s May 2022 Indie World Showcase:
Ooblets
Developed by Glumberland, there’s a good chance Ooblets is already a game you’ve played. That’s because it was previously released in early access on Xbox One and PC back in 2020. However, it’s now making its way to Switch, potentially in 1.0 form. It’s the same game, which is to say it’s a very cute farming/life simulation game where you control a highly-customizable character to grow Ooblets upon Ooblets.

If you thought it was all over for the 3DS, think again. Nintendo's marvellous handheld is still hanging in there, despite the fact that production of the console ceased in 2020, and that the eShop will be closing next year. That hasn't dampened developers' spirits, however, as Nintendo has reported that the console got eight brand new games in the fiscal year of 2021/22.
Axios' Stephen Totilo shared the figures on Twitter, which shows that this is an increase compared to the last two fiscal years. Both the 2020/21 and the 2019/20 period only saw two new 3DS games launches each, so we got four times as much 3DS in the last year!

Valve had filed a motion for the case to be dismissed, but the latest ruling states that game publishers "plausibly allege" that they "suffer price and non-price injury" from Valve's conduct related to Steam. In particular, the suit alleges that Valve use "most favoured nation" policies to prevent competition based on price.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I booted up Citizen Sleeper last night, I had no idea what I was in for. I had seen some buzz about it online and figured I’d give it a go – it was on Xbox Game Pass, after all, and the key art looked precisely the slick and punchy cyberpunk/sci-fi aesthetic I especially like. Little did I know, a few hours later, I’d be playing a game that I’d recommend to anyone at this point. 
Now, I’m about four hours in, and there’s the potential to crash and burn, but something tells me it’s not going to. Citizen Sleeper, as a game, is somewhat hard to explain: It’s a sci-fi, narrative RPG with no combat (at least so far), a dice-rolling mechanic that dictates everything, minor survival systems, and a rotating cast of characters that you’ll immediately want more of upon meeting them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over the past two decades, Rockstar Games has emerged as a force to be reckoned with in the games industry. Rising up from quirky Scotland-based developers with a taste for pulp and crime fiction, Rockstar evolved radically, shifting into innovators and provocateurs, creating some of the industry's most influential and blockbuster titles. In the lead up to the eagerly anticipated Red Dead Redemption 2, we came together as a staff to rank every single game that Rockstar developed (this means we excluded published titles like L.A. Noire and Smuggler's Run). From the humble top-down beginnings of Grand Theft Auto to the blood-soaked streets of Manhunt and the beautiful jaw-dropping vistas of Red Dead Redemption, you’ll find every single title put in its proper place in terms of influence, importance of innovation, and just plain fun.
With all that in mind, let’s steal a ride and roar down this road to hell. Read more...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Samsung 970 Evo Plus is a strong PCIe 3.0 NVMe SSD, offering excellent performance and reliability, but it costs $200 on Amazon for a new 2TB model. That's a fair bit, so we were excited to see a refurbished option for $140 at Best Buy. That's considerably cheaper than any other 2TB NVMe SSD on the market, and user reviews on Best Buy paint a rosy picture of barely-used drives whose condition can easily be checked.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pro wrestling is a combat sport. Scripted, yes, but the crux is two superstars stepping into a ring and (mostly) pretending to beat the snot out of each other. That’s why it’s been understandably boxed into the fighting/simulation genre. Outside of a few collectible card games and general manager sims, the genre has rarely strayed beyond its competitive roots, and I think that’s a shame. Wrestling can offer so much more to video games. 
The upcoming WrestleQuest is a great example of what you can do with wrestling games if you apply a bit of creativity. The title transforms the core concepts of the sport into a 16-bit RPG inspired by games like Final Fantasy VI and Chrono Trigger. It’s such a refreshing idea, and I can’t wait to see how it turns out when it launches later this year. WWE re…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of my biggest highlights from PAX East a couple of weeks ago was attending Shirley Curry, aka: Skyrim Grandma's panel about her roleplaying adventures in Bethesda's enormous RPG. Despite suffering a stroke just a couple of months beforehand, the 85-year-old YouTuber was on fine form during her PAX East panel, speaking to a packed out theatre of fans and viewers who have spent the better part of six years following her various playthroughs through Skyrim as a multitude of different characters. She talked briefly about her writing and character creation process for her Let's Play-style videos, before spending a whopping 45 minutes answering questions from the audience. These covered everything from her favourite things in Skyrim to her favourite, real-life candy, and also included a surprising number of horror game recommendations. In her own words, she loves stuff that's "weird and creepy", and has recently been looking for something new to play. "I’d really like to play a dark, scary game," she said, and the audience were only too happy to oblige. 
It was a truly wonderful way to spend a Saturday afternoon, and as soon as it was over, both Liam and I knew it was too good not to share. Here's a written transcript of the entire audience Q&A in full, plus a summary of her opening speech, for your reading pleasure.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After nearly 30 years of partnership, EA Sports and FIFA, the international governing body of association football, are parting ways after the release of this year's soccer video game. The announcement comes from a blog post from Electronic Arts that reveals what's next for the footie franchise.
With the current deal dissolving in 2023, EA will no longer use the FIFA name on its popular football series but will instead adopt the moniker of EA Sports FC. It's shedding any licensed identity in the name but still keeping many of its deals with existing football clubs and players. Cam Weber, General Manager of EA Sports, writes in the blog post, "Everything you love about our games will be part of EA Sports FC – the same great experiences, modes, leagues, tournaments, clubs, and athletes will be there." 
Outside of potentially losing the use of the World Cup tournament, it's unclear what else might be missing in future iterations. However, EA is still boasting impressive numbers of players and teams involved moving forward.
Our unique licensing portfolio of more than 19,000+ players, 700+ teams, 100+ stadiums, and 30 leagues that we’ve continued to invest in for decades will still be there, uniquely in EA Sports FC," says Weber. "That includes exclusive partnerships with the Premier League, LaLiga, Bundesliga, Serie A, the MLS – and more to come."
This year's FIFA 23 sounds like it will be business as usual with more features, World Cup content, leagues, clubs, and more and won't be subject to any of these changes. Weber says that we'll have to wait until summer 2023 to hear more of what's to come for EA Sports FC.
How do you feel about this change in branding and partnership? Is FIFA just a name to you, or does it bring something special to EA's brand of virtual soccer? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

“They’re all talking over each other and nothing’s getting done and it’s spinning into chaos,” says Pusateri, a VP for Creative Technology who goes by Dunk Dinkle in-game. “Why can’t these people who are being paid so much money behave as well as these people who get paid nothing?”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following the successful launches of Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order and Star Wars: Squadrons, Electronic Arts is finding its place in a galaxy far, far away. Respawn Entertainment, the development studio behind the Jedi title, is overseeing production for three different Star Wars games: a strategy title, a first-person shooter, and a sequel to Jedi.
I don't know what to expect from the first two games, but I expect Jedi to be a direct sequel that reunites fans with protagonist Cal Kestis, who is still trying to find his place in a troubled time with the Empire on the rise. If Respawn goes in this direction, here's what I hope to see:
The Light and Dark Side of the Force
Force Turmoil
A Gruesome Death for the Poncho
Play as BD-1
Larger Environments
More of the Same with the Lightsaber and Fighting
A Connection to The Mandalorian
The Mandalorian show, but I didn't expect to see one from Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. Star Wars fans believe BD-1 was in the show, meaning he's been around for over twenty years. How awesome would it be to see BD-1 return to that location and show us why he was there in the first place?
And now I'd like to hear what you want to see from Respawn's next Jedi game? Do you want Cal back? Would you rather have someone else in his place? If so, who? Also, if he does return, where do you think his story goes?]]></summary>

In it, the company sets expectations regarding upcoming releases. 
According to Nintendo’s chart of its expected launch schedule, which you can see a screenshot of below, the Platinum Games-developed Bayonetta 3 is still aiming for a 2022 release on the Switch. That’s especially exciting because the game went dark after its 2017 reveal until last September, when it reemerged with a dazzling first-look gameplay trailer.
Other 2022 releases Nintendo expects to actually hit this year include Mario Strikers: Battle League (June 10), Xenoblade Chronicles 3 (July 29), Splatoon 3 (September 9),…]]></summary>

The event began with a new story trailer, focusing on the cover monster Malzeno, who, with a horde of tiny vampiric monsters, drains life from the environment and captures other creatures. Malzeno has a history of devastating the kingdom of Sunbreak's new character Fiorayne and will continue to be a problem for hunters in this expansion.

Nope, sorry; it's confirmed only to be two-player, as that's what Batman would've wanted.

        <updated>2022-05-10T13:28:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The original Mass Effect trilogy is one of gaming's most celebrated epics, despite the controversial finale of the third chapter. Depending on players' choices, the fate of legendary protagonist Commander Shepard was either ambiguously hopeful or dismally tragic. Mass Effect Andromeda moved away from a Shepard-led story, and players have been eagerly awaiting any news about the next numbered installment. A Mass Effect 4 trailer dropped during the 2020 Game Awards and revealed everyone's favorite Asari Shadow Broker. And now, a new lithograph might be hinting at the return of the illustrious Commander. 
According to a VGC report, the initial description of a Mass Effect lithograph says it all: "While Shepard and the survivors are left to pick up the pieces, fans are left wondering what’s next." YouTuber MrHulthen noted that the text was quickly swapped out for something less direct. It now reads, "The threat of the Reapers might have been ended, but at great cost including Earth itself. While the survivors are left to pick up the pieces, fans are left wondering what’s next." Read the whole thing for yourself by clicking the link above. Could this sudden change mean that the Commander is coming back? Only time will tell, as Mass Effect 4 narrative details have been particularly scarce. 


Of course, BioWare isn't only working on its famed space opera. The next adventure in its high fantasy RPG franchise, Dragon Age, is on the way too. Similarly, story info for that game is few and far between, but excitement for both series couldn't possibly be higher.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo has announced that it will be hosting an Indie World Showcase tomorrow. 
The showcase will begin at 7 a.m. PT/10 a.m. ET, and it will run for roughly 20 minutes. As the name implies, the games showcased will be indies, so don’t expect to see the sequel to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild or anything like that here. However, if it’s like the most recent Indie World Showcase that aired in December, we could be in for some indie treats. 
Tune in May 11 at 7:00 a.m. PT for a new @IndieWorldNA Showcase featuring roughly 20 minutes of information on upcoming indie games headed to Nintendo Switch. #IndieWorld
https://t.co/OCOJhqYfD9 pic.twitter.com/5nuNImMLB0
May 10, 2022
That December showcase came with the release of Chicory: A Colorful Tale on Switch, a new look at Sea of Stars, and several game reveals, and it was a great time. Hopefully, tomorrow’s 20-minute presentation lives up to that.  As you might have guessed, fans are already preparing their ritual circles in hopes that Hollow Knight’s sequel, Hollow Knight Silksong, makes an appearance, just as they did ahead of the last Indie World Showcase. Naturally, there’s no word on if Silksong will make an appearance tomorrow, but it’d be a great moment if it did appear. 
While waiting for tomorrow’s showcase, catch up on everything announced in the December Indie World Showcase, and then read Game Informer’s list of our most anticipated indie releases for 2022. If you’re looking for an indie to play today, be sure to check out Game Informer’s list of the top 10 indies to play right now.

In the results, Nintendo calls Pokémon a first-party franchise, which some might not consider true since Game Freak, an independent party, develops most of the Pokémon games. However, Nintendo invests heavily in the franchise, and Pokémon games have always been released exclusively on Nintendo consoles. So, it’s hard not to call it a first-party franchise. On that note, Pokémon was Nintendo’s most successful property in the fiscal year that began in April 2021 and ended this past March.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Eiyuden Chronicle: Rising is a bit of a weird one. Originally conceived as a Kickstarter stretch goal for Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes, the next JRPG from Suikoden creator Yoshitaka Murayama, this smaller, more action-focused RPG has become both an official prequel to Hundred Heroes and a kind of intermediate stop-gap designed to tide players over until the main event next year. Focusing on the back stories of just a handful of the titular hundred you'll be meeting in Rabbit & Bear Studios' spiritual successor to Suikoden (the first of which memorably had a whopping 108 recruitable party members), Rising has the air of almost required reading for players eager to return to the lavish, retro worlds Murayama built his name on.

Its tumultuous cycle, which began in 1997, spawned several builds and demos by original developer 3D Realms. Today, footage of one of those early versions of the game has appeared online.
As spotted by GameSpot, a 4Chan user known as x0r uploaded footage of a 1-minute, 20-second slice of gameplay from a 2001 demo of the game. The video’s authenticity was semi-confirmed on Twitter by Duke Nukem co-creator George Broussard, who served as one of the lead designers on Forever with 3D Realms during its long development. According to Broussard, he has no idea how the footage resurfaced but shot down hopes of a complete, playable build by describing these demos as a “smattering of barely populated test …]]></summary>

From felling legends to taunting invaders, running around in Elden Ring with trusted pals never gets bland. And while many swear that From Software’s trial by fire loop is most rewarding when experienced solo, I’d argue the exact opposite. Boss fight difficulty is scaled to match party size, leading to more laughs and terror. Minions peppered throughout the world pack an exhilarating punch but are less frustrating to surmount. And dropping items for others makes character progression devilishly dynamic (my three Moonveils are a testament to this). 
But somehow, multiplayer still feels like an afterthought.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The RTX 3080 12GB is a little-known variant of the RTX 3080 released late last year. As well as coming with the same memory subsystem as the RTX 3080 Ti - 12GB of GDDR6X attached to a 384-bit interface - it's also faster than the vanilla 3080, with more CUDA and RT cores. 
That performance normally comes at a steep premium, but today an MSI Ventus 3X RTX 3080 12GB model is going for a low price over at Newegg. They're asking $810 for the graphics card after a $30 rebate, some $450 below the GPU's ludicrously high MSRP. That makes this model actually cheaper than almost all RTX 3080 10GB cards on the market, and a worthy deal for our hallowed deal archives.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been 4525 days since James Cameron's Avatar was released in theaters, decimating box office records, and today, the trailer for its first of many sequels dropped online. 
Avatar: The Way of Water rejoins Jake Sully (in his now permanent Na'vi body) and his partner Neytiri over a decade after the first film's events. According to the film's description, the two now have a family with kids of their own, and The Way of Water is the first of many new stories to chronicle "the trouble that follows them, the lengths they go to keep each other safe, the battles they fight to stay alive, and the tragedies they endure." Previously we got to see how the Na'vi live and thrive in the lush jungles on the planet of Pandora. This time we see how they fare on the coast, in the oceans, and of course, in the skies above it. The humans are still around, too, and look to be up to no good with armed Na'vi or Avatars in their ranks.
The trailer, which you can watch above, has plenty of grandeur, drama, and action. It brings back memories of how gorgeous the setting of Avatar is, and the last shot of the trailer shows Cameron hasn't forgotten how to make a cool action sequence. He is responsible for Terminator 2 and Aliens, after all. If I wasn't sold on the idea of more Avatar before the trailer, seeing Jake surf into the skies on a flying crocodile with a huge gun in hand and an ax on his back was more than enough for me to buy a ticket when presales go live later this year. 
Avatar: The Way of Water stars Zoe Saldana, Sam Worthington, Sigourney Weaver, Stephen Lang, Cliff Curtis, Joel David Moore, CCH Pounder, Edie Falco, Jemaine Clement, and Kate Winslet. It will be released in theaters on December 16, and yes, there will be a 3D version.
Are you excited about Avatar: The Way of Water? Did you remember that Ubisoft is working on an Avatar game set for release this year? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below!]]></summary>

Critically, it’s been more divisive than one might guess, with many either being put off by how "Sam Raimi" the Doctor Strange sequel is or completely smitten with it as a result of the Evil Dead director’s style. 
If you’ve seen the movie, you’ve likely noticed how unique it is in the pantheon of Marvel Cinematic Universe movies. It features more horror elements than ever before, and it introduces a lot of new concepts and ideas to the MCU. In fact, I think Multiverse of Madness sets up where the MCU is ultimately going later in Phase 4 and beyond. To speak any furthe…]]></summary>

Following its predecessor's footsteps, Salt and Sacrifice hits a similar 2D Soulslike feel. After perishing in the opening moments, your character becomes Spellmarked, an entity that treads the line between life and death by the power of magic.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[WWE 2K22 may be the current hotness, but some fans are still enjoying the online offerings of WWE 2K19 or 2K20. Unfortunately for them, that will soon come to an end. 
The WWE Games Twitter account tweeted that on June 30, the online functions for both of those games will be shut down. 2K explains that doing so allows the team to give its full attention to supporting 2K22. Once the shutdown occurs, 2K19/20 players will be unable to play online, download/upload user-created content, or interact with presumably any other feature dependant on the servers.   
📣 Attention WWE 2K community: On June 30, 2022, we will sunset support for WWE 2K19 & WWE 2K20 servers. This includes all online functions, such as online matches & Community Creations. We are turning our full focus toward supporting #WWE2K22. Thanks for your continued support! pic.twitter.com/vOJ06AA9iy
May 9, 2022
While 2K20 is largely remembered as a disaster, 2K19 was generally well-liked, but both games haven’t exactly maintained bustling online communities. The average Steam player count for both games currently sits between 90-130 players, so it’s easy to understand why 2K would feel justified in sunsetting online support.
Furthermore, WWE 2K22 garnered positive reviews (here's ours) and recently received the first pack of DLC wrestlers of its months-long roadmap. On paper, it behooves the team to bolster a game perceived as a relative return to form with updates as much as it can. It's undeniably a bummer to lose such a big function of the old titles for preservation purposes, if nothing else, but at least fans have plenty of time to squeeze in some online match-ups before the final bell tolls.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From the moment PlayStation 5 was announced, fans have been asking for a Bloodborne remake or remaster. Now seven years old, Bloodborne is one of PlayStation 4's greatest games, showing developer From Software can do terrifying and exciting things within a gothic, Victorian setting. Summer is always a hotbed for video game announcements, and even without an E3 this year, the rumor mill is spinning at full force, teasing massive games that we may see revealed in the months ahead. One of those games is Bloodborne. If you asked me if I wanted a Bloodborne remake or remaster before February 25, 2022, I would have screamed, "YES!"
Ask me this question now, and my answer is a bit more low-key but still a "yes." When I played Elden Ring, I expected big things from one of gaming's most consistent …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m testing an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 Ti this week. No fully-formed, review-style thoughts on it yet, though after an unusually stressy installation I do have a question: does it need to be so god-damned big?


“Yes, because heat” is probably the answer, as when you’ve got as many processor cores as the RTX 3090 Ti, running at such high clock speeds as the RTX 3090 Ti, and with as much memory as the RTX 3090 Ti, it’s a bad idea to try building an RTX 3090 Ti that’s the size of a postage stamp. But the best graphics cards aren’t huge as a rule, and when it’s got to the point where new GPUs can’t easily fit into a standard mid-tower PC case, it might be time for some course correction.

You blast through procedurally generated woods and sewers, bursting enemies for cash and channeling your profits into a skill tree that's also your own psyche. It's rad, basically, but its roguelite dusting doesn't quite hit the mark when a literal nightmare is turning into a metaphorical one.

        <updated>2022-05-09T14:15:11.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gotham Knights might feature four-player co-op, if an updated PlayStation Network Store listing for the game is to be believed. 
Gotham Knights, which lets players control either Nightwing, Batgirl, Robin, or Red Hood in a Gotham without its Batman, has marketed co-op as a feature since its reveal back in 2020. However, its co-op only supported up to two players. It seems that developer Warner Bros. Montreal, the studio behind Batman Arkham: Origins, might be looking to bump that number up. That’s because a new PSN listing for Gotham Knights lists the game as having four-player co-op, as reported by PCGamesN. 
As you can see in the screenshot above (taken by Game Informer this morning), PlayStation lists the game as one that “supports up to 4 online players with PS Plus.” It even features the symbol and wording for “4 network players” beside that, further supporting the claim that Gotham Knights might feature four-player online co-op. However, as PCGamesN notes, the description for the game still says Gotham Knights can be experienced “in solo-play or with one other hero,” which sounds a lot like two-player co-op. 
Perhaps Warner Bros. Montreal has a surprise announcement up its sleeve, or maybe it is developing a mode separate from the campaign that supports four-player co-op. Only time will tell. 
For more, check out this Gotham Knights gameplay walkthrough and then watch the latest trailer for Gotham Knights, which highlights the control of the Court of Owls. Read about how Gotham Knights was delayed to October after that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Salt And Sacrifice is a 2D metroidvania hunt-a-thon that casts you as a condemned prisoner in an imperiled kingdom. Magic is corrupting the land, giving rise to monstrous creatures and ravenous undead, and the source of all of this destruction, Mages, must be hunted and their hearts devoured if the Kingdom is to survive. Like Ska Studios’s previous outing, the game features difficult combat, extensive equipment options, and hulking bosses to slay. But while the scale has increased and the combat and visuals are as slick as ever, there are some growing pains that only just manage to hold the game back from its full potential.
Upon booting the game up, it’s immediately clear that you’re in for a visual treat.The design and detail are just ever so lovely: from the way firelight gives a soft glow to its surroundings in the twilight, to how fog wafts lazily over cobble stairways in a musty dungeon, it’s all just so utterly gorgeous to look at. Ska Studios have always had a recognizable art style – imposing architecture and grungy moppets – but it’s plain to see here that they’ve upped their game in the best possible way. According to the devs, every asset was created from scratch, and that care shows in every frame.

Years have passed since I last played, causing the vague memories to distort into a recollection that’s nothing like reality. In my head, that first arcade game captured the frenetic energy of the TMNT cartoons I’d watch on a Saturday morning. The reality was quite different, with the turtles awkwardly bumbling through Manhattan while occasionally smacking an enemy.
That realisation has never been more apparent than after playing the first two levels of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge, a successor to those early beat ‘em up TMNT arcade games being developed by Tribute Games and published by DotEmu. It captures the aesthetic of those childhood memories and makes them a reality, which is a testament to Tribute Games’ understanding of TMNT as a brand. But it also feels far too familiar, failing to substantially innovate on the original formula.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Superhero open-world action RPG Gotham Knights will be playable in four-player online co-op, according to a leaked PlayStation store listing. A screenshot of the game’s PlayStation store page was posted to the Gotham Knights subreddit over the weekend by keen-eyed user SuspiciousTension19, which shows that it will support “4 network players”. Eurogamer have confirmed that the listing is accurate, too. We don't know yet whether this will also apply to PC players, of course, but it’s highly likely to be the same across all platforms.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lost Ark is in an interesting position. It's an MMO hack-and-slasher which made its enormously popular western debut earlier this year, but which has been out in South Korea since 2019. That means that there's a wealth of already existing endgame content that its developers need to decide when its appropriate to bring across to the western release.

They have decided that time is: this month.

As a lifelong Marvel Comics reader, I often get a huge kick out of the post-credits sequences in the Marvel Cinematic Universe movies. Marvel does a fantastic job of teasing new characters and storylines, giving fans just enough information to get excited and debate what might be coming next to the movies and TV. Thanos' reveal in The Avengers made my theater erupt with comic fans gasping over the potential of an Infinity Gauntlet story, and non-comic fans saying, "Who was that purple guy?"
Since the movie is over at this point, people are freely chatting about the tease of note as the credits roll, and I've had many conversations with strangers to fill them in on who a character may be or why a particular …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hearthstone Battlegrounds is but a few days away from a major shakeup. On May 10, Blizzard will be releasing pats 23.2, which includes the significant Rise of the Naga update for Hearthstone's auto battler. With it comes a new hero, Queen Azshara, and a brand new minion keyword called Spellcraft that gives the player temporary spells out of thin air each turn to buff their team of minions. 
Speaking of minions, a new race of creatures will be coming with Rise of the Naga, and it will, of course, be the Naga themselves joining the fray. No longer will the Murlocs be the only amphibians making their presence known in the Battlegrounds. In total, Rise of the Naga will add 23 minions to the Battlegrounds pool of cards, all of which you can gaze upon below. 

Since Naga are the new hotness in Battlegrounds, that tribe will be receiving the most support, with 16 total Naga being added to the game. They'll mostly be the cards embued with Spellcraft, although there is one non-Naga with the ability. Five more minions of other types are joining the card pool as brand new minions, and two familiar faces will be making a return to the format. However, with all of these additions, there are going to be some subtractions; five minions will be retired from Battlegrounds as soon as patch 23.2 hits on Tuesday.
How much do you think the Naga will change the meta of Hearthstone Battlegrounds? Are you excited to play around with the Spellcraft mechanic? Let us know your thoughts on this big update in the comments below!]]></summary>

We got a small taste of her next adventure in a 12-page short story in the comic book Skybound X, and now, if you run out to your comic book store today, you can see what happens next for absolutely free.  Each year, retailers celebrate Free Comic Book Day by giving away dozens of comic books from various publishers for free. One of this year's books is Clementine: Issue One by publisher Skybound Comet and Eisner and Ignatz award-winning writer and artist Tillie Walden.
This free book is surprisingly lengthy, giving readers 27 pages of Clementine's next story, as well as an interview with Walden. This story leads into Clementine: Book One, a graphic novel that releases in June. Here's the official product listing from Skybound for the forthcoming book:
Clementine is back on the road, looking to put her traumatic past behind her and forge new path all her own.

On April 25, Overwatch League (OWL) graphic designer Zenofy took to Twitter, inadvertently recounting the drawn-out resurgence of Overwatch 2 and the severe recession of Overwatch 1 with three sobering sentences:
906 Days since the announcement.
767 Days since the last new hero.
1103 Days since the last new map.
The PVP Beta opened on PC 24 hours later, accumulating over 1.5 million concurrent viewers on Twitch, the highest ever for the franchise.


My friend group and I were late to the first game, but when we finally mustered the courage to play competitively, “Beyblade” Meta had started to fade into obscurity, and “Triple Tank” became the standard.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Those excited to get their hands on the retro-flavored action RPG Souldiers will have to wait a few more weeks.  
Developer Retro Forge announced that Souldiers will miss its May 19 launch and now arrives on June 2. The delay gives the team additional time to iron out some lingering technical kinks, with creative director Alberto Hernández writing in a press release: 
Souldiers is perhaps best described as a 16-bit amalgamation of Metroid exploration, RPG progression, and Souls-like combat. As either a scout, caster, or archer, you’ll battle across a fantastical land that sits on the border between life and death. You can watch the original announcement trailer here to see it in action. 
You can play Souldiers on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A not-so-long time ago in the same galaxy we all reside in, Respawn Entertainment deviated from its first-person shooter roots to create Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. This third-person action game was the studio’s first stab at tackling the coveted Star Wars license, crafting an original adventure set five years after Revenge of the Sith. It stars Cal Kestis, a padawan turned junker (played by Shameless star Cameron Monaghan) that managed to evade the Jedi purge of Order 66. After he’s outed by the Sith, he embarks on a quest to recover an artifact capable of locating force-sensitive children while also avoiding capture by the Inquisitors, who are elite Jedi hunters. 
The game features a blend of lightsaber combat and a suite of Force abilities. Borrowing inspiration from FromSoftware’s Soul series, encounters are challenging, requiring a strategic blend of blocks and parries to outduel opponents. Meanwhile, the various planets take on a Metroid-inspired progression with players unlocking abilities to backtrack to previously inaccessible areas. 
Watch on Twitch!
Fallen Order was released on November 15, 2019, and was a critical and financial success. It also served as a saving grace for single-player fans, providing proof to an increasingly multiplayer-focused EA that linear story-driven experiences can still make the big bucks. With a sequel reportedly in the works, we’re revisiting this gem of the Star Wars video game pantheon. 
Join Marcus Stewart, Andrew Reiner, and Jill Grodt on Twitch today at 2 p.m. Central as we journey through the entirety of Cal Kestis’ adventure. Expect plenty of laughs, deaths, and general nerding out over all things Star Wars. We encourage you to hang out with us in chat. Just as a reminder, subscribing to Game Informer on Twitch rewards access to the official Game Informer Discord channel where you can interact with our lovely community as well as the editors. See you in chat!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Evil Dead: The Game is only about a week away from launch, and if rewatching all things Evil Dead hasn't put you in the mood to blast apart Deadites with friends, the title has a new original song to treat your ears to. 
The Statik Selektah produced track is titled “Come Get Some” and features the vocal talents of Method Man along with PXWER and iNTeLL. In a nice touch, the beat samples Joseph LoDuca's original Evil Dead score. The song will presumably appear somewhere in-game, but you can listen to it now in the video below or seek it out on your streaming app of choice, including Apple Music, Spotify, and YouTube Music.


Evil Dead: The Game is our cover game for the month of May. The asymmetrical multiplayer title pits four players in the roles of Ash Williams and his allies against one player-controlled demon. It launches May 13 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. Be sure to catch up on a month’s worth of exclusive features on the game by visiting our cover story hub below.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In theory I'm rather partial to slash-em-up crowd fighting games, but I've never got on with the big names in the genre. Your Devil May Cries and your God Of Warses are the obvious reference points for describing Ultra Age, but it doesn't really feel like them, and I don't think it's trying to either.
The basic idea is that you're stranded on a jungle planet full of industrial ruins, and have to fight through robots and huge animals in small groups, switching between several (kinda samey) swords as needed. It's not really doing anything spectacular, but it's enough of its own thing to feel like more than just a budget God Of Cries.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Razer Naga Trinity is a rather brilliant mouse for MMO gamers, or anyone really that likes or needs to have plenty of buttons right under their thumb. The Naga Trinity's key feature is that it comes with three interchangeable side panels, each with a different amount of layout of buttons - so you can have a regular two-button side layout for FPS titles, a seven-button layout for more complex games (MOBAs?) and a 12-button calculator-style layout when things get properly exciting (MMOs). Or you can just figure out which one is your favourite, and keep it on forever more. 
The Naga Trinity's UK RRP is £110, but it normally goes for about £70 or £80. Today, it's down to £55 - a nice discount!

For its street price of £110, you get a compact yet easy to build in design with a choice of mesh or glass side panels, plus a pair of low profile 120mm fans. Today however, you can pick up this brilliant little case for £76 in black or white, or £85 to £96 for colours like orange, purple, teal and pink. Either way you slice it, this is an incredible case for the money - and I should know, I've got two of them in my room right now.

We sought a lighthearted battle royale having tried loads of others, and were suckered in by the prospect of a Fortnite that didn’t feature people erecting defensive fortresses in milliseconds.
Incredibly, the game has delivered. I'm having fun - albeit with a tinge of unease. Not only does the game act like a blaring reminder that I've lost touch with the Top 40, it's also a bizarre metaverse where nothing is sacred.

Like a seasoned ronin, the combat is clean and refined. The story is simple and elegant. The visuals are straight out of a classic samurai flick. But while it gets a lot of things right, it's also a literal trek to the underworld: the scenery is stunning, but your legs hurt, and your arms ache from killing all the bandits. So many bandits! The lack of enemy variety hurts what could've been a sensational hike - but it's still a trek worth embarking on if you break it up with a few pitstops.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last week, you decided that romance is better than de_dust2. I'm a little surprised, considering Dust 2 not only took an early lead but has likely been modded into every game which features romance too. But I accept the decision, and our mission continues. This week, I ask you to pick between a trade-off and something with no negative consequences at all: drawbacks, or a load of lasers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[May is a relatively quiet month when it comes to new PC games. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing, of course. The first half of 2022 has been unusually stuffed with great things to play, and I’m sure a lot of us will be thankful for the opportunity to spend some time with the few bits and pieces that were overshadowed by your Elden Rings and your Dying Light 2s earlier in the year.


For those looking for something new, however, May still has a lot of interesting stuff to offer those hungry for an indie game or two. Think of me this month as a waiter in a fancy restaurant, offering you a carefully curated selection of bite-sized delights as part of our tasting menu. What we have on offer is both nutritious and delicious, a journey through genres that is sure to excite the palette.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My FixFox journey, not unlike that of the titular little furry protagonist Vix, has been abnormally long and strange. I started playing it, then moved and didn't have a PC for a long time, and it was only recently I finally got my PC back and finished the game last week. It took me around 12 hours of playing the game to travel around a strange cuboid planet using postage stamps to fix hairdryers for robots, but stretched over three months in real life. And reviewing a game this many weeks after release isn't normal procedure either, but I really like FixFox and I want people who might like it to stand a better chance of finding it. I also think a break of several weeks isn't the worst way to experience it, either.

The free, time-limited event is still all about hoovering up medallions for your chosen class, but there are two new elements called Strike Scoring and Strike Medals to consider this time around. Strike Scoring is based on your time spent in Guardian Games playlists and where you rank, while Strike Medals are won by “pulling off some pretty impressive feats, like taking out a ton of enemies with a fancy little combat jig like Shatter,” so Bungie say.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've never been one for playing aggressively in turn-based tactics games. I will hug and skulk between half and full height walls like nobody's business, creeping up the map inch by inch lest one of my precious party members accidentally sets off an entire warren of alien nasties by blundering too far ahead or, heaven forbid, one of them gets nicked by a stray bit of shrapnel. To say I'm overprotective is an understatement. 
Thankfully, the Grey Knights in Warhammer 40K: Chaos Gate - Daemonhunters are made of sterner stuff. I mean, just look at these brutes. They're enormous. Even the Gears Of War lads would be jealous of the kind of muscle these big robo boys are packing, I'm telling you now. They're by no means invincible, of course, but they can hold their own out of cover, and pick themselves back up again when your best laid plans inevitably start going down the drain. It may not be my most natural style of tactical manoeuvring, but man alive is it liberating.

It was meant to launch this year, but the game’s already been delayed indefinitely once before.

Not so, says Gilbert. On the subject of his previous comments, he says "None of these are promises or anything I owe anybody."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Logitech G502 Hero is the most popular gaming mouse on the market, not to mention the RPS reader's choice and our current 'best gaming mouse overall' - so it's exciting news that it's going cheap on Amazon UK today. 
£29.99 is the cheapest we've ever seen this mouse, beating out last year's Black Friday price, and it's also 63% off its UK RRP. That's a fantastic deal for a comfy mouse with 11 programmable buttons, adjustable weights and an 'infinite' scroll wheel. 
If you prefer your mice with more batteries and fewer cables, the wireless G502 Lightspeed is also discounted heavily, from £129.99 to £57.99. I reckon that's strong value for a mouse that remains comfy, high-spec and fully-featured, while adding on Logitech's industry-leading wireless tech. The wireless mouse is also much less frequently discounted than its predecessor, which does tend to see a price drop in line with the major 'shopping holidays' of the year.

Like a shorter Black Friday, this can be a good opportunity to pick up some PC gaming hardware at severely slashed prices, so if you’re currently weighing up a new SSD or replacement mouse then it may be prudent to hold off until the event gets underway. And you might not even need to shop at Amazon for it, as some rival retailers like to run their own deals to compete with Prime Day directly.

He is not my favourite character in Citizen Sleeper but he is the one who best represents it. In one scene he explains his deep anti-capitalist reasoning to you. Systems should not govern people's behaviour, he says, the people are what matters.
Throwing off the shackles of a faceless process governing your life is a recurring theme in this blend of sci-fi RPG and interactive fiction, and it makes for a strong rags-to-ramen story of one robot on the run. Even when the game's own systems of dice and clocks clash with its stories of human interest, it is the people who come out on top.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in March 2021, when the Intel Arc Alchemist graphics cards still went by their architecture title of Xe HPG, Intel launched a digital scavenger hunt to drum up interest in these upcoming desktop GPUs. This ran for so long and so quietly that I’ll admit I forgot it was happening, but it’s now concluded, and prize info sent to the 200 winners contains the first real hints at what these mysterious gaming cards will cost.

There's more to say as well, but that was my main takeaway from the current build. Much like actual gardening, a lot of The Garden Path is inscrutable to me - at least from the visits I've made to the garden so far, which is actually more of a free-form forest at present.
