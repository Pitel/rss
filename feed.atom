        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Clash: Artifacts Of Chaos is nails, mate. And that's coming from someone who recently reviewed Team Ninja's Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty, a game that's mighty good at grinding people into paste. I'm not trying brag; I'm being vulnerable with you. I have a case of the Ben Affleck blues, where most sessions of Clash's third-person action-adventuring have me veering from elation to being slumped against a wall with Affleck's signature grimace on my face.
Aside from being really difficult, I'm a bit undecided on how I feel about Clash in the portions I've played so far. It looks fantastic and puts some brilliant spins on combat, but levelling is a bore and exploration has a confusing edge. It's at once both a grand time and an annoying one. The surreal lands of Zenozoik, it turns out, aren't all sunshine and turkey men. There are a lot of turkey men, though.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wiggle wiggle wiggle
Patch 6.35 is live for Final Fantasy XIV, adding a bevy of content that includes tribal quests for the beloved Loporrits. But while XIV's bunny ear wiggle emote is mostly a fun little gesture for players, the buns among us seem to be a bit weirded out.
The new emote Ear Wiggle, or /earwiggle, is a reward for reaching Rank 8 with the Loporrits, a pretty hefty achievement to accomplish. When used, it lets the player spawn a pair of their own bunny ears and make them do a little wiggle.
For Viera, who already have bunny ears, this can look a bit jarring, as those crawling through the update have already found.
https://twitter.com/ivalicea/status/1633121658063015943
Granted, these achievements usually take a pretty fair amount of time to accomplish, so there's still time for the team at Square Enix to take a look at the emote before the wide populace can start using it around the Limsa Aetheryte.
Still, it's left some Viera players feeling a bit disappointed in the outcome. Given the artwork from the 2023 new year celebration, which featured Viera doing the Loporrit emote with their own Viera ears alongside the smaller bunnies.

Wishing on the rabbit's foot
I do get the disappointment. I'm an Au'Ra player, and I'd be bummed if some sort of draconic emote didn't lean into those aspects of my Warrior of Light. But as an Au'Ra player, I've also seen the ways in which the cosmetic portions of characters can create general weirdness.
Viera are the case-in-point, as headgear for the bunny-styled characters has been a sticking point. The four ears of the bun-pocalypse is indeed haunting though, and so part of me does hope the buns get an emote they'd like.
If you want to start grinding for your own set of bunny ears, you'll need to get to work on your Loporrit quests in Final Fantasy XIV. Turn-ins don't turn themselves in, you know.

This includes concerns that Activision could even create a worse COD experience on a competitor's console. Here's the slice where Sony lays out this possibility:

World of Warcraft is getting its patch 10.1 "Embers of Neltharion" as part of the Dragonflight content rollout. And when it arrives, it'll add a feature that should bring the World of Warcraft a little closer together through cross-faction guilds.
Though guilds had to stay within faction lines previously, the new patch will allow guilds to exist across the barriers of Alliance and Horde. The faction binary has long defined World of Warcraft, as the war of Alliance v. Horde raged on. But in years since, that has loosened; patch 9.2.5 for Shadowlands introduced cross-faction instanced content to the MMORPG. Now, Blizzard is bringing guilds into the togetherness.

That's because the SSD offers excellent performance while working within the confines of the SATA interface, with straightforward TLC NAND flash and a DRAM-equipped design that ensures strong sustained performance - something lacking in QLC DRAM-less designs. 
Today, the Crucial MX500 in its 2TB capacity is down to $102.99 at Amazon US, making it nearly 50% off its MSRP and the lowest price we've ever recorded.

A piece of Nintendo history has resurfaced on YouTube. Once-lost footage of Nintendo's prototype LCD monitor for the GameCube has shown up, years after the hardware was shown at E3 2002.
YouTuber and IGN parent company Ziff Davis employee Adam Doree uploaded some footage from the show, as noticed by GoNintendo. This LCD monitor was apparently shown at E3 2002, but was never released.

The attached LCD monitor would have made that GameCube handle suddenly make a lot more sense. To me, it feels like a distant murmur of the ideas that would lead to the Wii U and Switch. Part of the thinking, as Nintendo's Satoru Iwata explains in the footage, is that players might be able to carry their GameCube around and link them up, u…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Now you can be insulted on a whole new platform
Sony has released the latest firmware update for its princely gaming platform PlayStation 5 (PS5) — The 23.01 update is now available to download to the console, weighing it at a little over the 1GB mark.
Perhaps the most notable addition here is the long, long-time coming integration of the Discord service, which will let PS5 users sync their current Discord accounts to the PS5 console, offering up new ways of communication with friends, enemies, and new enemies. The PS5 Discord service will also allow for game invites, party chat, and even screen sharing. Thus, it will be a useful tool for anybody who frequently plays with friends, or likes to make meandering, half-interested conversations while gaming.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2sHOKZCYkg&t=1s&ab_channel=PlayStation
In addition to Discord, the new update offers up a fistful of new technical features. These include a 1440p Variable Refresh Rate option (provided you have games and displays to support such an option). The DualSense controller can now update wirelessly, and PS5 to PS5 data transfer can now be made over Wi-Fi (ah wouldn't).
In a neat touch, Game Capture can now be activated by voice, allowing players to simply call out "Hey PlayStation, capture that" for an instant recording of recent gameplay, without having to break their flow fiddling through menus. This tool is particularly cool if you're somebody who frequently shares clips online. I still feel weird talking to my console. But then, I feel weird talking to anyone.
This just scratches the surface of the new update, which also includes an improved Screen Reader, revised folder filters, and new library options for PSVR 2 titles. For full details on Version 23.01, check out the official patch notes over on the official PlayStation Blog.

Additionally, the update introduces variable refresh rate support for 1440p, allowing smoother visuals for VRR-compatible HDMI 2.1 displays at 1440p resolution. The game library now filters PSVR and PSVR 2 titles. Data transfer between different PS5 consoles has also been added, and PS4-to-PS5 save data transfer has been significantly streamlined.

When we reviewed The Rumble Fish 2 in December 2022, we were quick to praise its unique style and great gameplay, but fairly chastised the old-school scrapper for forgetting some hugely important features — vital to any modern fighter, re-released or otherwise. Fortunately, a new update for the cult release will address some of these misgivings today.
The new update, live now on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms, contains several vital online options, these include a new Spectator Mode for waiting players, as well as a rematch option at the end of each fight, saving you from having to return to the lobby and search for the same opponent. Additionally, a new indicator will give players a heads-up on their opponent's connectivity, and will also offer the ability to reject a match if the connection is poor.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHBPAQzu_nQ&ab_channel=3goo
The Training Mode has also been tweaked, offering multiple settings for your training dummy, as well as adjustable recovery options for your meters. The Training Mode will also now allow you to save your lab settings for future sessions. Finally, the match timer can now be set to 99 seconds max, and a new "Combat Range" option should prevent a frustrating bug that was causing combos to drop in widescreen ratio. These adjustments will help bring the rerelease up to par with some other fighters, and a further update is expected in April.
In related news, indie publisher Clear River Games has launched a physical edition of The Rumble Fish 2 on PlayStation platforms, with a Nintendo Switch edition releasing on March 28. You can order the physical edition from game retailers in Europe and North America, while the digital edition is available now on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Version 1.3.0
Fire Emblem Engage is up to its third patch, though surprisingly (perhaps a relief to some) none of them have been extremely meaty thus far: this newest version included.
In a move that I'd call adding "small quality of life changes," version 1.3.0, which was released late last night (US time), a few mechanics have been altered amid the arrival of Wave 3 of the expansion pass. Beyond the additions of Chrom, Robin, and Veronica: the patch also has two changes, in addition to "issues that have been fixed to make for a more pleasant gaming experience" (thanks for the specifics!).
For one, you'll be able to exchange items at the ancient well in the Somniel hub, after talking to the proprietor of the armory. You can also use inherit skills in the arena. Small potatoes for sure, but hopefully all of these patches will sprinkle in quality of life changes like this: just like the prior February 8 patch added the recreation interaction to the pool, orchard, and stable zones in the hub.
More features in the hangout hub is a great thing! Though all of this might not be enough to sway folks who were already turned off by Engage. Hopefully the upcoming story content mixes things up.
Fire Emblem Engage Patch 1.3.0 - Released March 7, 2023 (Full patch notes)
General Updates
Compatible with Wave 3 of the Expansion Pass.
From Chapter 7 forward, you’ll be able to exchange items at the ancient well on the Somniel.

You’ll need to talk to the proprietor of the armory.
You can now use Inherit Skills in the Arena.
Issues have been fixed to make for a more pleasant gaming experience.

Publisher Funcom, in association with Swedish developer The Outsiders has announced a release date for Dream of the Beast, a brand new DLC expansion for its hellish shooter Metal: Hellsinger. The new expansion will be bringing new songs and weapons to the award-winning actioner on March 29.
Two new headbangin' tracks will be included in the DLC. The first will feature the powerhouse vocals of Lacuna Coil frontwoman Cristina Scabbia, who I've super-duper fancied for literal decades, but don't tell her I said that because I'm shy. The second track is performed by Will Ramos of New Jersey's Lorna Shore, who I haven't heard of, but don't tell them I said that because I'm super-duper old. The searing vocals of both artists will soundtrack your next trip out of the underworld.

In addition to the new songs, the Metal: Hellsinger Dream of the Beast DLC will also include a devastating new machine gun "The Red Right Hand", as well as a selection of new player skins that will add new modifiers to the game. So, even if you've already run this unique and super-cool shooter into the ground, it seems that the new update will give you more than enough reason to bust out the devil horns once again. And it looks like the lost soul known as "The Unknown" still has a helluva lot more lead to fling in harm's way.
Metal: Hellsinger is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms

Although it was announced as part of a promo event for AMD’s Radeon RX 7000 GPUs, Infinite’s ray tracing works on any graphics card that can usually handle RT effects; all you need to do is download the update and flick it on in the display settings.
Granted, it’s not the most visually sumptuous form of ray tracing I’ve clapped a visor on. Reflections and global illumination are unchanged, as it’s only sun shadows – shadows cast using a simulated sun as the light source – that get the RT treatment.

Sega and Two Point Studios have announced that the next DLC for Two Point Campus is coming on March 15. Titled School Spirits, this expansion will have you building educationaries specializing in exorcism.
It’s unfair. The press release used one of my trigger words: “bust ghosts.” It’s like they know my weakness.
School Spirits will take you to Lifeless Estate for your next challenge. Included are two courses with all the normal accouterments. Also included is a new janitor-focused challenge mode, which is giving me flashbacks to training janitors to suck up dead patients in Two Point Hospital.
[embed]https://youtu.be/ibeQX_c877Q[/embed]
This seems like a smaller experience than the recent Space Academy, which had three campuses and six new courses. To reflect this, the price is lower for School Spirits. It also feels like this cuts down on bloat since while the campuses in Space Academy were all unique, the space courses were largely interchangeable. That's not so much a complaint as it is an observation.
I just wish they weren’t dropping this during a really busy review schedule for me. I can’t not play it.
Two Point Campus: School Spirits is coming on March 15, 2023. It will be released on PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch. It’s run you $5.99 in American currency slices.

In a new video hosted by game director Todd Howard, he states the Direct in June – which happens to be the weekend before E3 starts – will provide a "deep dive" into the game. He reiterates that Starfield is a unique experience that also has many of the hallmarks fans expect from a Bethesda title. We last saw Starfield during the Xbox Game Showcase last summer, where Bethesda revealed its extensive scope, including thousands of planets, spaceship construction, environmental scanning, and other features. 


Starfield was originally slated to launch on November 11, 2022, before getting delayed. It was later reconfirmed to launch within the first half of 2023, and though September sits on the second half of the calendar, we're happy to see the game get a concrete date again. 
Starfield will be available on Xbox Series X/S and PC and will also launch day one on Xbox Game Pass.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Publisher Chucklefish announced Wargroove 2 today, a sequel to its well-received Advance Wars-inspired strategy RPG. 
Developed by Robotality, Wargroove 2 is set three years after the first game, with a new faction looking to use ancient technology to conquer the now-peaceful land of Aurenia. The main story unfolds across three interconnected campaigns set on land, the sea, and the sky and features a new cast of commanders. It also features a new roguelike campaign called Conquest that tasks players to complete a series of smaller battles while making permanent choices and relying on the same pool of units, health, and resources. 


Wargroove 2 features four-player co-op and versus battles (local and online) along with rule customization and asynchronous play. An in-game editor allows players to create custom maps, campaigns, and even cutscenes to share with other players. 
The first Wargroove was lauded as a fun throwback to Advance Wars when it launched in 2019, so we’re excited to see what Chucklefish has in store for the follow-up. Wargroove 2 doesn’t have a release window, but it’s slated to launch on Switch and PC. You can read out review of the first game here.]]></summary>

Welp! Like many of us assumed, Starfield is no longer arriving in "Q1 or Q2" of 2023 as previously stated. Bethesda just dropped a video that shared the new release date: September 6, 2023. The good news is that it's an actual, firm date! Bethesda boss Todd Howard himself showed up on the freshly minted "official launch date announcement" video posted on Bethesda's YouTube channel to share the news.
Following an ominous collective of mostly narrative-focused footage and a "09/06/23" numerical confirmation, Howard appears and notes that he's "so excited to tell us when Starfield is coming out this year." Howard says that they're "playing the game all the time," and are taken aback at how large it is. Todd Howard gonna Todd Howard! What a hype man. And there's more to hype, apparently, as a new "Direct" is coming for the game in a few months.
[caption id="attachment_367619" align="alignnone" width="640"] Image via Bethesda[/caption]
Starfield Direct stream confirmed for June 11, 2023
Howard confirms that a "Starfield Direct" (the exact term used) is arriving on June 11, 2023, which will provide a deep dive into the game's universe right around E3. Most of the reactions to this news will probably be some form of "it's about time," which Howard acknowledges in the video, stating that "you've waited a long time to play something from us [Bethesda]."
Given how Fallout 76 turned out, taking a bit more time to get everything right is the smart decision.

Chucklefish has announced that a follow-up to their 2019 strategy hit, Wargroove, is on the way. Wargroove 2 has been announced for Switch and PC, with no stated release window.
In a trailer dropped alongside the announcement, Chucklefish shows off the sequel’s new pirate faction. Wargroove 2 is touting three intertwined campaigns and a new roguelite conquest mode. Likewise, the robust campaign creator will be making a return.
[embed]https://youtu.be/aL8C_8u_jyI[/embed]
Aside from that, Wargroove 2 is looking like more of the same. There are mentions of air and naval units, four-player skirmishes, and co-op. Both of which were also in the original title.
I bounced off the original Wargroove twice. I liked what I played, but I found it a bit more rigid than I expected. I thought it would be closer to Advance Wars and discovered there’s a deeper puzzle element to it. My brain isn’t that big, so I stumbled a bit and didn’t recover. I tried again with a physical version and had the same result. However, the sequel coming is making me think it’s time to give it another try. I liked what I saw; it just wasn’t clicking.
Wargroove 2 is coming to PC and Switch. It’s available to wishlist now, but no release window has been announced.

Bayonetta Origins, otherwise known as Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon, is slated for release on March 17. Before that, you can test out this interesting spinoff in demo form. It's actually out today, and will pick up from the opening moments of the game through "the early chapters."
Here's the full rundown of the demo from Nintendo:
"This is your lucky day. Or unlucky day, depending on how you play your cards, for the Avalon Forest is just as beautiful as it is beastly, and it has an appetite for wandering witches. In the Nintendo eShop demo, you can try out the early chapters of the Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon game. As a bonus, save data will transfer over to the full version of the game, when purchased, which launches on March 17."

Yes, you can transfer save data from the demo over to the full version of the game. It seems like it's a given for most larger IP these days (especially Nintendo games), but you never know! Also, there are accessibility options in tow: "The game also features accessibility options, such as reducing damage or automating some controls, that can help anyone (newcomers and Bayonetta fans alike) enjoy the game."
[caption id="attachment_367603" align="alignnone" width="640"] Image via Nintendo[/caption]
Where to download the Bayonetta Origins demo
You can find it right here under the "download demo" heading on Nintendo's site, or go to it directly on the eShop.

And I was like, "wait, so until you turned up to they just eat each other? How do they have a sustainable population? What's going on here?"
Thus, in a spirit of pure scientific enquiry, I booted up Sons Of The Forest and immediately discovered that everyone has been lying to me, because Sons Of The Forest is not a survival game. Sons Of The Forest is very clearly an early 00s b-movie action thriller. The script was left in a filing cabinet in Slough in an empty office until the office was repurposed into a call centre, at which point it was found by a middle-manager whose paintball team thought it was awesome, and somehow he sent it to a game developer by mistake. This is what happened, and you cannot convince me otherwise.

Just a few days ago we were given copious leaked info for the upcoming Fortnite season, which will shift away from The Witcher and the medievil focus into something else entirely. Thus far the key info we've gotten seems to be "first-person mode" (likely similar to how no-build is a separate, hopefully permanent mode now), and a neon aesthetic. A new tweet from Epic Games appears to confirm the latter.
https://twitter.com/FortniteGame/status/1633120555153989636
The tweet is classically "Fortnite vague", and just reconfirms the neon setting that has been present in leaks and rumors this past week. The phrase "made with precision" seems to be referring to the chef in the picture (who could be a skin), teasing players to "prepare for Fortnite Mega" (which could simply be the nomenclature of the new season/zone). As usual the marketing for Fortnite is on point; as there's a combination of rumor-spreading, speculation, and semi-confirmation that's just enough to talk about. Once the seasonal skins and tie-ins are fully confirmed, that's when the floodgates will open.
The biggest news out of this tweet is that the new season (Chapter 4 Season 2) actually starts on March 10 (note: the current season ends on March 8). A follow-up tweet confirmed that there would be downtime on March 10 at 2AM ET, with the season likely debuting shortly after.
The post “Fortnite Mega” teased in new tweet, new season coming March 10 appeared first on Destructoid.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wayfinder, an upcoming action RPG with light MMO touches, is being developed by Airship Syndicate, the folks behind Darksiders Genesis and Ruined King: A League Of Legends Story. I've spent some time with the closed beta, poking and prodding at the game's live service cogs to determine whether it's running a smooth operation or a clunky one that may not be worth your time.
And you know what? The game took me by surprise. So far, it's a decent time that's perhaps more along the lines of a Destiny, than say, World Of Warcraft. I genuinely believe it could garner a big community and have a bright future ahead of it - but when it comes to such a saturated space, I worry that Wayfinder may struggle to stand out, and won't attract players who are done with the usual rise 'n grind demands of these sorts of games.

It’s a pretty great time for refurbishment right now. With Metroid Prime’s fantastic remaster in recent memory and Resident Evil 4’s remake just up ahead, those of us who like to re-experience old favorites with re-done visuals are eating good. Fatal Frame: Mask of the Lunar Eclipse is something special, however. Originally released exclusively on Wii in 2008, it never left Japan. While the re-release of Fatal Frame: Maiden of Black Water was apparently enough to warrant a remaster, I’m surprised Koei Tecmo would go to the effort of localizing such a niche title.
I’m glad they did. While Fatal Frame: Mask of the Lunar Eclipse harkens back to an uncomfortable period of survival horror, it also… uh, harkens back to an uncomfortable period of survival horror. Back when controls …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fatal Frame: Mask of the Lunar Eclipse originally released on the Nintendo Wii in 2008 exclusively in Japan. Until this week, it had never been localized for North America, but starting March 9, it will be available on just about every platform with improved visuals and a new photo mode. Fatal Frame is a game all about fighting ghosts in haunted locations with a magic camera, but this will be the first time you can pause the game and take pictures in the contemporary "photo mode" way we are all now familiar with.
This episode of New Gameplay Today ended up being a long one, making it feel a bit closer to our Super Replay series where Marcus Stewart and myself have been playing classic horror games like Dino Crisis and Silent Hill. I promise we do encounter some ghosts, though – you just need to be patient.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It was... inevitable
The extremely compelling mobile card game Marvel Snap has had a stupendous launch, having raked in just over $50 million USD in revenue since its launch on iOS and Android platforms in October 2022.
The digital tabletop title — the first game from Californian studio Second Dinner — sees players build a deck of heroes and villains from the famous comic book brand, before going to battle in strategic, turn-based gameplay. Players can earn or purchase various new cards in order to build up their deck, and take part in limited-time events, seasons, and tournaments. Currently, the title is enjoying an Ant-Man-themed event, in collaboration with the recent Marvel Cinematic Universe release Ant-Man & The Wasp: Quantumania.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNuq6E3enZQ&ab_channel=MarvelEntertainment
Due to the exciting nature of the game's roster as well as a short playtime of only a few minutes — Marvel Snap won over a huge community of players at Quicksilver speed. Roughly 12 million players downloaded the title in its launch month with around $30 million in revenue pulled in by January of this year. Of course, many mobile titles enjoy this burst of incredible success in their opening six months, and time will tell whether Marvel Snap will continue to grow over the remainder of 2023. But given the popularity of the Marvel brand, and the overall quality of the game itself. I would expect those microtransaction bucks to keep rolling in for the foreseeable future.
Marvel Snap is available now on iOS and Android platforms. A console version is also in the works.

The latest League of Legends third-party adaptation is arriving fairly soon. Riot Forge announced today that The Mageseeker: A League of Legends Story will launch for Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, and PC on April 18.
The Mageseeker is developed by Moonlighter studio Digital Sun, and published by Riot Games' publishing arm Forge. It's an action RPG starring League of Legends champion Sylas, an escaped mage who joins up with rebels. You take on Demacia, a nation built on the bodies of mages, and it looks like you'll deal with some familiar League faces along the way. Check out the new gameplay trailer to get a peek:

Arkane Austin has confirmed that its upcoming multiplayer shooter Redfall will support crossplay on all platforms and across all stores — This will allow monster hunters on Xbox Series X/S, PC, and Xbox Game Pass to rock out together, including PC players on both Steam and Epic Games Store.
The "all-in" crossplay support is a no-brainer for the multiplayer-driven title, and will allow for a larger shared player community which can only help to grow and prolong the life of Redfall and its nefarious nocturnal activities. Up to four players step into the uniquely talented roles of four uber-hip characters, before heading into the titular Massachusetts town in order to purge it of an army of unholy creatures.
https://twitter.com/playRedfall/status/1632773032744828928?s=20
Originally revealed back in the summer of 2021, Redfall would ultimately miss its intended 2022 release date, but is now pretty much cemented to arrive in just a couple of months' time. While a lack of an open beta or demo leaves us with nothing but the title's atmospheric trailers to go on, we can expect a Left 4 Dead/Back 4 Blood style team shooter, with parties of players harnessing wild weapons and bespoke otherworldly abilities to put the legions of the undead back in the cold, cold ground.
Redfall launches May 2 on Xbox Series X, PC, and the Xbox Game Pass service.

Anyone who makes or writes music knows that the path to a complete track isn’t a linear one. It’s a process where instruments weave in and out of the composition on the whim of the person making it. And even when the vision is clear, and you know exactly where you want to take the song, be it behind a drum set, a keyboard, a loop track, or even a computer, things can get in the way. Rytmos, developer Floppy Club’s first non-mobile game, nails that feeling. It uses puzzles to extract the joy, escalation, triumphs, and trials of making music, and it does so with g…]]></summary>

Forever Entertainment has dropped a new trailer for Storm Trident’s Front Mission 2: Remake, and along with it has included a release date of June 12, 2023. It’s currently slated as a Nintendo Switch exclusive.
Front Mission 2 was released on Sony’s original PlayStation way back in 1997. Notably, this entry in the series never left Japan. It takes place 12 years after Front Mission 1st, showing a future Bangladesh (renamed Alordesh) as they seek to sever ties from the OCU. The narrative baton is passed between three protagonists as they discover a conspiracy behind the anti-OCU coup d’etat.
[embed]https://youtu.be/NQrghowLZvY[/embed]
The remake boasts new visuals, a free-zoom ability to get right in close to your Wanzers, and a “renewed” soundtrack. Underneath the modern gloss, Front Mission 2 Remake “preserves the mature story, strategic turn-based combat, and Wanzer customization options of the original.”
While the Front Mission 1st: Remake didn’t set my world on fire, it did leave me primed for the sequel. Beyond simply being fun strategy games, I love tinkering with the Wanzers to create the ultimate stompy force. My only previous experience with this series was looking over a roommate’s shoulder as they played through Front Mission 3, so having the ability to experience the series in order has been a welcome one.
Front Mission 2: Remake releases exclusively for Nintendo Switch on June 12, 2023.

What day is it this Friday? I'll tell you what it is, it's MAR10 Day, dagnabbit, and The LEGO Company is preparing to show off something new and special in order to celebrate Nintendo's most famous and perhaps most beloved character (after Luigi).
On Friday, the toymaker will be holding a special "Lego Super Mario YouTube Premiere" live stream, offering updates on its lovely LEGO Super Mario range and teasing "exclusive content and a big reveal". The action kicks off on the official LEGO YouTube channel at 00:80 PT / 11:00 ET / 17:00 GMT and will be hosted by Jack Gardner — who I am assuming is not the former 1950 British Empire boxing champion.
https://twitter.com/LEGO_Group/status/1632758034895077376?s=20
The LEGO Super Mario range, which launched in the summer of 2020, has consisted of multiple sets and showpieces featuring the characters and worlds of Nintendo's best-selling series. For younger players, there are sets that allow for the building of "courses" to be played by smart interactive Maxifigures of Mario, Luigi, and Princess Peach. For the more dedicated collector, LEGO has released prestige (and pricey) kits of the Super Mario 64 Question Block, Bowser's Airship, and The Mighty Bowser himself.
We'll be sure to pick you abreast, and abrick, of all the news from the LEGO stream once it is revealed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Riot Games announced last month that three League of Legends games would arrive this year, including The Mageseeker: A League of Legends story. Now, the company has announced that The Mageseeker will hit consoles and PC next month. 
More specifically, The Mageseeker will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on April 18. It will cost $29.99 on digital storefronts, and preorders include the Lost Silverwing in-game bonus. You can also purchase the Digital Deluxe Edition for $39.99, and it includes additional digital items like a Silverwing Supply Station Pack, Home Sweet Home cave decorations, exclusive spells, and Unchained skins. 
Check out the game in action in the new trailer below: 


"Developed by Digital Sun, creators of Moonlighter, the Mageseeker is a gritty 2D hi-bit pixel action RPG, set in Demacia, a mighty kingdom in the world of Runeterra that seeks to curtail what it deems as forbidden magic while wielding magic themselves to maintain order," a press release reads. "Play as Sylas, an escaped mage who joins a band of rebels in the deep forest. Their revolution will shatter Damcai's deceptive peace – a peace built with the blood and sweat of mages. The Mageseeker provides an action-packed fantasy gameplay experience for those looking to experience a story of power, identity, and justice." 
Riot Games also revealed today that it is selling a physical Collector's Edition of the game for $169.99. It includes a Sylas statue, an art book, a deluxe art print, the Lux Comic (special edition hardcover), Sylas & Lux enamel pins, and a vinyl soundtrack. All of this comes housed within an exclusive custom box. 

The Mageseeker follows the release of 2021's League of Legends Story game, Ruined King. Check out our thoughts on that in the Game Informer's Ruined King: A League of Legends Story review. The other two games Riot Games plans to release this year are Song of Nunu and Convergence.

I have to follow soon after, and though I’m undoubtedly scared, in the moment, I’m much more afraid of killing the creator of Spelunky than my own mortality. Though you could argue, in this hyper-specific example, the game should’ve been a cautionary tale. In Spelunky, you do die a lot.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hit the books ahead of launch
Would-be wizard generals will get a chance to test out GrimGrimoire for themselves today. Vanillaware and NIS America are releasing a demo for GrimGrimoire OnceMore, for PlayStation and Nintendo Switch.
Set in a magical school, GrimGrimoire OnceMore follows the very eventful early days of Lillet Blan. As things get bad, she'll eventually have to put her schooling to use in the form of side-scrolling strategy warfare using familiars and grimoires.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YO4B3IEaCJU
OnceMore is a remaster of Vanillaware's original GrimGrimoire, a 2007 PlayStation 2 strategy game. And it looks like the developer's putting together a pretty solid list of improvements to the original experience.
An altered screen ratio and updated resolution help on the graphics side. Grand Magic spells, an added Skill Tree, and the Tactical Notebook all serve to offer more to do on the gameplay side of things, too. And a new Gallery features illustrations from Vanillaware staff, with over 90 images created for GrimGrimoire and OnceMore.
Cast a spell on you
This isn't the first time Vanillaware's brought forward one of its earlier hits to modern systems. The absolutely superb Odin Sphere Leifthrasir put the action-RPG back in the conversation. (Side note: I do hope that eventually gets a Switch or Steam port.)
Meanwhile, 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim made a fairly big impact for Vanillaware. With that in mind, it's neat to see them going back to the vault and pulling out a piece of the studio's history that feels linked, if only by the strategy genre. Today's GrimGrimoire demo should give players an idea of just how it's evolved over the years, and a taste of what's to come from the remaster.
GrimGrimoire OnceMore hits PS4, PS5, and Nintendo Switch on April 4, 2023.

With the launch of Destiny 2: Lightfall came a new Darkness subclass, Strand. Whilst the initial fan reception to Strand was pretty underwhelming, as time has gone on the more dedicated players have had time to dig deep into the new subclass and come up with some powerful new builds. We've already covered Warlocks and Hunters, with armies of Threadlings and infinite enemy suspension all possible. This time we're going to take a look at the space shooter's brutes, the Titans.
We're looking to create a build that will give unlimited barricades to protect against incoming enemy fire as well as turn you into a suspending machine. We're obviously going to be using the Strand subclass, and some important aspects, fragments, and armor mods to help achieve that.

But there is one bit of connective tissue, namely that charging into the fray is generally a bad idea. In the case of the game, that's because The Light Brigade is VR roguelike, one that blends Souls-like dark fantasy with World War II-era weaponry, with you playing a spiritually immortal but physically fragile warrior responsible for saving the world.

Valve’s handheld SteamOS games machine has successfully evaded hardware flop status, currently sitting fourth in Steam’s own top sellers list a full year after it began shipping. That’s well deserved, too: the Steam Deck was a fun little alternative way to play PC games when it released, and through a combination of added features, ongoing improvements to game compatibility, and simply a wider choice of great games, it’s a better device now than it’s ever been.


I was originally going to look back on the Steam Deck’s first 12 months with my eyes only, but what fun is a party of one? Thus I invited Valve designer Lawrence Yang and engineer Pierre-Loup Griffais for their takes on the Deck’s past, present, and future.

The game, which challenges you to blast the demons of Hell to the beat of an original soundtrack featuring some of the biggest names in metal, is adding two new original songs to the soundtrack through the first piece of downloadable content.
The DLC, Dream of the Beast, adds original songs from two singers who didn't appear on the main game's soundtrack. Cristina Scabbia from Lacuna Coil and Will Ramos from Lorna Shore join the cast of recognizable singers to contribute to the soundtrack. Dream of the Beast also adds The Red Right Hand, a new machine gun, and three new outfits, each of which provide unique gameplay modifiers.
These updates join the game as part of the Dream of the Beast DLC, but players who don't purchase the premium content also have something to be excited for. The same day the DLC arrives, players can expect a free title update for Metal Hellsinger. This free update adds a new song selection feature.
Both of these updates arrive on March 29 on all platforms. The game, which took home Game Informer's "Best Shooter" award for 2022, is available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. For more on Metal: Hellsinger, check out our review here. You can also read our interview with System of a Down singer Serj Tankian, who contributed to the base game's soundtrack, right here.]]></summary>

He declared that accounts engaging in "repeated, egregious weaponization of DMCA on Twitter" will receive temporary suspensions. The problems began when a popular user tweeted a stunning video owned by a professional photographer, who responded by sending a DMCA takedown notice. That sounds straightforward, but this dispute is a lot more complex than that.

Nate (RPS in peace) liked it quite a bit for its “masterfully crafted strategic dilemmas,” despite his findom relationship with the game. Now Mars Horizon is getting an expanded sequel, taking us to the outer reaches of the Solar System. Mars Horizon 2: The Search For Life is releasing sometime in 2024 on PC.

In the case of new town builder Outlanders, I'd have to share a house with five other people, the farmer just died of old age, and my leader wanders around doing nothing while occasionally issuing edicts forcing me to have children. But at least there's a chance of pumpkin pie.

Despite my love for large-scale simulation games like Cities: Skylines as an adult, I was not a SimCity player growing up. Instead, I was pulled in the direction of the more manageable SimTown. The zoomed-in town management, where you can micromanage every aspect of your citizens' lives without the massive scope of SimCity, always appealed to me more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We've seen 2TB PCIe 4.0 SSDs under the £100 mark before, but never have we see one for a clear £5 below - and never this model either. The Adata Legend 800 has been steeply discounted at Ebuyer, where £92 plus £3 shipping gets you this new model capable of 3500MB/s reads and 2800MB/s writes.
Yes, this isn't the best gaming SSD in terms of raw speed, but its PCIe 4.0 design means that it uses less power and fewer lanes than PCIe 3.0 alternatives of the same speed, a nicety for desktop use and a big deal for laptops.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cities: Skylines II was announced at today's Paradox Announcement Show, and it’s coming later this year.
This follow-up builds upon its 2015 predecessor with new features, such as fully-realized transportation and economy systems. Paradox didn’t reveal too many other specifics beyond stating in a press release that the game features “ a wealth of construction and customization options and advanced modding capabilities.” Cities: Skylines II is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S (including Game Pass), and PC. Check out the teaser trailer below:


The original game was a big success, having sold over 12 million copies and filling the simulation gap left by SimCity's hiatus. Developer Colossal Order has supported it with multiple updates and expansions, including a VR port and a recent current-gen remaster. You can read our original reviews of Cities: Skylines on PC here and the console edition here.]]></summary>

The super auto-battler did eventually start making custom artwork for its later expansions, but much of the furious fauna was still emojis. That has now changed with today's patch, going back to replace all the old emojis with new animal pictures. Goodbye, old friends.

        <updated>2023-03-06T15:41:34.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Puma has unveiled a new shoe collection inspired by the popular MMORPG, Final Fantasy XIV. 
The collaboration will consist of four shoes: two Puma Slipstream models and two RS-X models, as reported by Techraptor. For each model type, there's a (Warrior of) Light version and a Dark version, which basically equates to white and blue-green, and black and purple-pink. All four of the shoes look great but before you get too attached, these shoes are Japan-only for now. There's no word on if they'll come to the U.S. 
Check out the shoes in the gallery below: 

Each of these shoes will cost 17,050 yen, which is roughly $125, according to Techraptor. They will be released in Japan next week on March 15. 
Shoes inspired by video games have risen in popularity, with Converse releasing two sets of Pokémon-inspired shoes last year. Perhaps more than any other shoe maker, though, Puma has been steadily releasing video game shoes. In 2018, it released a pair of sneakers based on Sonic the Hedgehog's iconic red shoes and then in 2020, Puma released a line of Super Mario All-Stars shoes. Puma announced some NBA 2K21 shoes in 2021 and then just two months later, the company revealed an Animal Crossing: New Horizons line of sneakers. 
While waiting to learn more, read Game Informer's Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker review.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As I have complained about mightily in the past, I grew up somwhere that didn't have much in the way of entertainment, so me and my friends had to engage in the time honoured tradition of making our own fun. Once we reached about age 17 this included playing poker with a shared second-hand chip set, and trying to do beer centurions (the progress in the latter affecting our interest in the former). I was never any good at it because, though poker was a fixture for several years, I was never really able to learn the rules. What hand is good? Why has your hand beaten his hand? But the little pictures are the best, I don't understand! It's disappointing because understanding poker is a cool adult thing, plus not understanding it makes certain pivotal scenes in James Bond films quite hard to parse.
Last week we got an email (shout out Aidan) singing the praises of Aces And Adventures, and I do try to check out recommendations from readers, even if I don't have time to reply or to write about the games. In this case I've made a special because Aces And Adventures is a great game that is teaching me winning poker hands through the medium of a dwarven warrior smashing things.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Seth Rogen announced in 2020 that he was producing a new animated Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie and today, Paramount Pictures released the first trailer for it...and it looks great!
What's especially notable about this trailer is the animation style, which is quite unique for both the TMNT franchise and animation in general. It's reminiscent of stop-motion mixed in with the comic-style vibes of Spider-Man: Into The Spiderverse, although it's also very much its own thing.
Check it out for yourself below in the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem trailer below: 
From permanent teenager @SethRogen, a new generation of heroes will rise...from the sewers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dead Cells is one of the best roguelites I've ever played and was one of the standout games in the very crowded 2018. However, its success is only possible through standing on the shoulders of the giants that trailblazed the genre. Of all the franchises Dead Cells drew inspiration from, perhaps no series was as influential as Castlevania. Because of this, the crossover between the two, which comes in the form of premium DLC for Dead Cells called Return to Castlevania, is a natural fit that not only resurrects Konami's dormant franchise but gives a nostalgic shot in the arm to one of the best roguelites available today.
Diving back into Dead Cells for the first time in years, I couldn't help but effortlessly fall back into the hooks of the stellar gameplay loop. I love discovering secret ar…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bandai Namco has revealed a new Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi game. 
Yesterday, the publisher released a short teaser trailer for the game, running less than a minute, that highlights footage from previous Budokai Tenkaichi games before showcasing what appears to be the new one. In the footage of the new game, we see Goku powering up. And then the words, "Get Ready For Battle" and "A New Sparking Begins" appear on screen. 
Check it out in the Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi teaser trailer for yourself below:

「ドラゴンボール Sparking！」シリーズ

March 5, 2023
As you can see, the game might be called, in some variation, Dragon Ball Sparking (that's what the tweet calls it if you use Twitter's built-in translate function, too). But regardless, the trailer ends with "A New Budokai Tenkaichi" begins, quelling any doubt that this is a new game in the series that has laid dormant for 16 years. Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi 3 was released in 2007.  
The teaser trailer doesn't indicate if this is Budokai Tenkaichi 4 or something else but it's exciting nonetheless to see that Bandai Namco hasn't forgotten about the series. It is somewhat surprising to see this announcement, though, considering Dragon Ball FighterZ exists. Budokai Tenkaichi is a fighting game series as well but to see a new one before a sequel to FighterZ, which was released in 2018, is something I imagine not many people could have predicted. 
While waiting to learn more about this Budokai Tenkaichi game, read Game Informer's Dragon Ball FighterZ review.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Skyrim came out I was a student, and I worked in Gamestation (RIP) to help pay for chicken noodles. I remember the hype around it very clearly because Gamestation had a deal where you could buy it for like £22, and I had a sideline going when the stock was low to keep some back for my friends. Apols if you were caught in the crossfire for that, but dragon fever was running high off the back of a still very cool trailer, and shouting Fus Ro Dah was the only cure. 
In the years since, Skyrim has been released and re-released many times, on every conceivable platform. "Arrow to the knee" jokes became de rigueur and hacky almost overnight, and at this point might have horse-shoed back around to being funny again. There are many examples of unrelated games or videos that cut to black fading back up into the opening of Skyrim, in a kind of sub-genre of rickroll. Does it hold up now? Kind of. It's a really fun, ambitious RPG, with faults - but if the faults didn't exist maybe it wouldn't have been as popular as it was.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Virtuální Bastlírna slaví 2 roky svojí existence. Pravidelná každoměsíční online setkání s diskuzí nad tématy ze světa vědy a techniky, zejména z praktického pohledu, často ale i s nadhledem a humorem, jejichž tradice vznikla za Covidového lockdownu. Tak jaká témata si bastlíři z projektu MacGyver.sh připravili na toto jubilejní 24. setkání? Určitě bude zmíněna statistika samotné Virtuální Bastlírny. Zajímalo by Vás kolik unikátních návštěvníků se v online prostoru bastlírenského Zoomu již sešlo a kolik bastlířo-hodin prodiskutovalo?

Ze světa HW pak kluci vyhrabali 100 MSa/s osciloskop postavený na RP2040, energeticky úspornou technologii pro přenos dat mezi senzory umístěnými na lidském těle, nové velice levné ARMy pod 5 Kč a nové procesory od ST, požár v továrně na čipy, falešné CO2 monitory, Raspberry debug probe, nový nástroj na tvorbu plošných spojů nebo blížící se semináře a webináře o elektronice.

Za SW zase třeba zbrusu nový KiCAD 7.0.0, emulace zvukové karty Gravis Ultrasound na RP2040, probíhající standardizace šifrovacích algoritmů pro IoT, podpora Bluetooth v Rpi Pico SDK, jak se dělá raytracing na FPGA nebo spolupráce mezi projekty KiCAD a Inventree.

Ať už vás zaujalo cokoliv z nabízených témat, chcete ukázat nějaký svůj bastl a nebo si jen potřebujete postěžovat na nedostatek volného času, dorazte! Příští Virtuální Bastlírna se pod taktovkou projektu MacGyver studentského klubu SiliconHill bude konat v úterý 7. března od 20:00 minimálně do 22:00 (ale obvykle končí o dost později). Odkaz na konferenci se před samotnou akcí objeví na bastlířské wiki.]]></summary>

This effectively should resolve a long-standing issue with modern Android devices, in particular those running Android 11 and above, whereby users could not properly access the game data folders or the save game files in the external storage.

This card normally retails closer to £50, with a stated UK RRP of £55, but it has dipped as low as £37.99 for a few days over the past year. 
Still, this is a very reasonable price for a memory card that's good for up to 130MB/s sequential reads and meets the A2 requirements for random performance.

This was obviously a real treat for me as RPS' resident Sims fanatic, but I'll admit I went in with my expectations parked in neutral. After all, the theme of this new-content duo is young families, and that just isn't part of the game I engage with too much these days.

        <updated>2023-03-03T18:51:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yosuke Matsuda, president and representative director of Square Enix, is stepping down after 10 years in the position. 
The official announcement states that he’ll be replaced by the relatively new Takahashi Kiryu, a company director who joined Square in 2020, as part of an organizational restructuring. The proposed change will be voted for approval at the 43rd Annual Shareholder’s Meeting in June. Square Enix’s reason for the change is as follows:
Matsuda became president in 2013, succeeding Yoichi Wada as part of a massive restructuring. His time at the top could be viewed as a bit of a rollercoaster. He pushed for innovation in Square’s flagship franchise, Final Fantasy, and voiced commitment to remaking and re-releasing popular titles from Square’s back catalog, such as Final Fantasy VII. The MMO Final Fantasy XIV also became a global phenomenon under his watch, though the company as a whole has largely struggled to land a massive success outside of the franchise. In recent years, high-profile Square Enix-published titles such as Marvel’s Avengers and Babylon’s Fall had disappoitning releases, with the former ceasing development this year and the latter shutting down this week. 
Perhaps most infamously, Matsuda was also at the front of Square’s tumultuous relationships with its North American third-party publishers, namely Crystal Dynamics and Eidos Montreal, whose titles such as the Tomb Raider reboot trilogy, Deus Ex, and Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy were often deemed commercial disappointments. That came to a head last May, when Square Enix sold off these studios and their IPs to Embracer Group.
In recent times, Matsuda was also a vocal advocate for NFTs and blockchain gaming. In January, he published a letter detailing upcoming company initiatives, including making games that incorporate blockchain technology.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Leaks are the bane of every publisher's existence, forcing marketing plans to shift, change, or just get scrapped. But that's partly why I'm enjoying EA's approach for advertising the Skate. reboot. Footage from the open-world skateboarders’ playtest leaked last September, and EA have since responded by releasing their own janky videos. These clips give us a taste of the whacky ragdolling happening right now, and it's probably the most entertaining way of marketing a game while simultaneously sucking the air out of leaks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've recommended a pretty wide variety of genres over the years, but I didn't expect a brick breaking game to surprise me like Destructure Colon Among Debris. It's not that I dislike them. They've just never really made much impression (possibly because I don't see all that many)
Destructure blends in a hint of shooting, resource management, and leans into the sheer fun of destruction, replacing bricks with "structures" that aren't meant to be anything specific, but give the whole feeling an impression of combat, an assault you're carrying out rather than a reacting, abstract geometry game.
Also it feels and sounds great to hit stuff. That's probably the bigger reason.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm going to Japan in a couple of weeks, and I am beyond excited. It's been 15 years since I last visited family in Yokohama, and my last memory is one where I'm miserable and I'm staring out of a cab window going back to the airport. I didn't want to leave. It sounds corny as heck, but I can't wait to sucker punch that memory with a swing that's been building for 5478 days, then jab it full of happy ones. Really, I imagine what will happen is I'll get weirdly emotional as the plane touches down and my mate Simon, who I'm going with, will be like, "Get a hold of yourself you buffoon".
I got LINE recently -  a Whatsapp equivalent that's big in Japan - to arrange some meetups with friends and family. Those arrangements have happened, which brings me great joy. But in a surprise plot twist, it meant I got back in touch with a guy called Sam. Now Sam, he's a good bud and we go a long way back. All the way back to the original Gears Of War days. And I think we've arranged, as is custom, to play Gears 6 whenever it arrives. Such is the bizarre way of things.

It was an insightful look at the nuts and bolts of game dev, so I’m glad Ninja Theory are returning to the concept for the spooky action sequel Hellblade 2: Senua’s Saga. The first episode takes a look at Iceland - the sequel's setting - and the team's painstaking commitment to recreating it as realistically as possible. The photogrammartry tech on display is seriously impressive, and following the team to Iceland feels like watching a British travel series, without the crude humour.

The trailer above also reveals that this new Pokémon anime will debut in Japan with an hour-long special on April 14. As for the rest of the world, the release remains unknown but the trailer does say 2023 and beyond so hopefully sometime this year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo has revealed that Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscribers can jump into Metroid Fusion when the game is added to the NSO library on March 8. 
After surprise releasing Metroid Prime Remastered last month, Metroid fans have another game from the series' history to play through, this time in the Game Boy Advance game first released in 2002. Once Fusion is live with NSO, players can finally experience Samus Aran's full 2D series journey on the Nintendo Switch, starting with the original Metroid game all the way through Metroid Fusion and 2021's Metroid Dread. 
Check out the Metroid Fusion Nintendo Switch Online trailer announcing the news below: 


"In Metroid Fusion, interstellar bounty hunter Samus Aran is attacked by an X parasite while exploring the mysterious planet SR388," Nintendo's description of the game reads. "This organism is not only deadly, but it can mimic the abilities of any creature it infects – including Samus herself! Saved from the brink thanks to an infusion of Metroid DNA, the X parasite's only natural predator, she soon discovers that the parasite has spread to the research station orbiting SR388. Weakened and out of options, Samus must do whatever it takes to destroy the X threat before it's too late." 
Nintendo says Metroid Fusion contains "a multitude of secrets" for players to experience that links Super Metroid to Metroid Dread. 
Speaking of Metroid Dread, read Game Informer's review of it to find out why it was one of our favorite games of 2021, and then read Game Informer's Metroid Prime Remastered review. Check out our list of every NES, SNES, Game Boy, N64, Sega Genesis, and GBA game on Nintendo Switch Online after that. 
Metroid Fusion hits Nintendo Switch Online next week on March 8.

The two production companies involved are longtime horror fixtures Atomic Monster (who have made The Conjuring, Annabelle, and Malignant) and Blumhouse (the company behind Paranormal Activity, M3GAN, and Get Out.) The film doesn’t have any talent attached right now, but the two companies are currently looking for a director and a screenwriter. Blumhouse says, "it’s imperative we find someone who appreciates and loves the world as much as we do, to help us bring the game to the big screen".

Judging from the manual it supports the very latest socket types for Intel and AMD’s gaming CPUs, and being under the Amazon Basics brand, it's dirt cheap at £21 / £27. 
It’s unlikely, though, that Bezos and the gang have been secretly funding R&D into an all-new line of PC gear. As Tom’s Hardware spotted, the Amazon Basics Computer Cooling Fan appears to simply be an existing budget cooler, the Cooler Master Hyper H410R, without the CM badge.

The pack also adds new dirt types, such as bio-residue. 


This DLC was created in collaboration with Square Enix, with Final Fantasy VII Remake director Tetsuya Nomura writing in a press release, 
“When I heard about the proposal for a collab, I was quite busy with various other collabs and reviews, but I was especially excited about this one. I had just been playing PowerWash Simulator and was daydreaming about cleaning things from my titles. My immediate response was, 'let’s wash the entire Shinra building.' Unfortunately, that seemed to be a bit difficult, but the final line-up is exciting, nonetheless. This is something I have been looking forward to a lot, and hope everyone has a great time!”
This pack follows a Tomb Raider-themed expansion that launched in January. This is a pretty neat trend, and see other video game properties added to the game that are in need of good clean-up. 
Powerwash Simulator is available now for PlayStation and Xbox consoles, Switch, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Alienware AW3423DWF is a monitor we've talked about a few times, as this 34-in ultrawide QD-OLED manages to outperform almost everything else on the market - albeit with a four-figure price tag that also eclipses almost every alternative. 
Now though, this 3440x1440 165Hz gaming OLED has dropped in price by a sizeable 26% or £310. That brings the monitor well into three-figure territory at £880, still pricy but a reasonable value given that this Dell monitor is head and shoulders above its IPS, VA and TN opponents.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Somehow, it's been almost a decade since the last numbered Age Of Wonders game. Despite dipping their toes into the sci-fi realm with Age Of Wonders: Planetfall three-odd years ago, developers Triumph are now returning to their fantastical 4X strategy roots with Age Of Wonders 4, due out on PC in just a couple of months on May 2nd - and what a homecoming it's shaping up to be. I've spent the better part of a week and half playing an early build of AOW 4, getting to grips with its enormous array of customizable factions and hero types in its generous crop of single-player realm maps. 


There's a heck of a lot to get through, but rest assured: this is Age Of Wonders through and through - and thanks to the addition of those new, customizable factions, it's also the most RPG-like entry yet, which is good news for budding D&D-ers looking for a grand, 4X strategy game to sink their teeth into. Heck, I'd even go as far as saying it could be one of this year's biggest and most exciting fantasy games outside of Baldur's Gate 3.

A few snippets of gameplay at the end of the trailer revealed speedy action against giant beasts and a semi-open world desert you can slide across - and who doesn’t love sliding in games? We now know when to expect developer Deck13’s latest, as the team have announced a May 16th date for PC and consoles. Publisher Focus Entertainment say a gameplay reveal trailer is “coming soon”, but for now we can enjoy a couple of new screenshots.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Given that Dead Island 2 has been in development for the better part of a decade, it’s understandable to have some trepidation about its quality (and general existence). Developer Dambuster Studios hopes to convince players that Dead Island 2 is not only close to finished but is a worthy follow-up by releasing an extended gameplay walkthrough that provides the rawest look at its action. 
The guided demo follows Irish punk rocker Dani, one of the game's six playable characters, and shows off a lot of the moment-to-moment action across various locales. The gory F.L.E.S.H. system is on full display, as is the wacky makeshift weaponry, including electrified Wolverine-esque claws. We also get a look at the card-based perk system and one strange sidequest involving pizza. 


Dead Island is slated to launch on April 21 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. We recently featured the game on our cover and you check out a month’s worth of exclusive features by visiting our coverage hub.]]></summary>

As Rock Paper Shotgun's Resident Resident Evil Liker, I took it upon myself to obsessively study each individual frame of this video file to uncover its hidden secrets. Surprising even myself, I was able to extract 17 new details about Leon's refreshed holiday to rural Spain. That's one new thing for each minute of the footage! That wasn't intentional! What a pleasing coincidence!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Star Wars Jedi: Survivor director Stig Asmussen of Respawn Entertainment wants the series to be a trilogy. 
This news comes from a new IGN Unfiltered interview with the director, which is where Asmussen revealed that even before the release of Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order in 2019, the team was already discussing sequel ideas. For Asmussen, Cal's story has always been a trilogy in his head. 
"We were already talking about the second game," said Asmussen. "I mean, frankly, we were talking beyond. And these are conversations that, when we're breaking this story with Lucasfilm, it's like: 'Well, where are we going with the second game?' I always wanted to see this as a trilogy. How can we take Cal and the crew to new places beyond what we were doing in the first game." 
Asmussen continues, stating that Respawn had a good idea of where Survivor, which is due out April 28, takes place in terms of the Star Wars timeline. The team also knew what the stakes were going to be, what the tone was going to be, what Cal was going to be up against, and how his crew was going to be factored into all of that. On top of that, Respawn thinks about the ideas "that we could do beyond that as well." 
Star Wars Jedi: Survivor was originally due out March 17, but was delayed to April 28. While waiting to get your hands on the game, watch Game Informer's interview with Cal Kestis actor Cameron Monaghan, and then check out our exclusive preview of Star Wars Jedi: Survivor for new details about the story, exploration, and combat.

I'm not the new one in sheep’s clothing, because they haven’t released anything yet. Like many, I was especially drawn to The Wolf Among Us, a neo-noir murder mystery set in the same universe as the Fables graphic novels. It would have been quite poetic to return to the series ten years after its debut, but that’s not going to be paw-sibble, as new TellTale have announced that The Wolf Among Us 2 has been delayed out of 2023. There’s no new release window, but maybe it'll be ready in 2024. Hopefully.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's easy to label Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty as a Soulslike that's basically Nioh and Sekiro mashed together. To some extent, that's true. But I think Wo Long is Team Ninja having sanded off some - not all - of the edges from the overwhelmingly complex Nioh, to craft an action RPG with even crisper combat than its predecessor. And crucially, it's more approachable as a result. Clever ranks and meters reward, whether risk-taking is your jam or you're more of a careful type. It may still be a tricky venture filled with demonic, titanic cows that'll want to pound your skull into the dirt, but this is Team Ninja's most encouraging effort yet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At first glance, King Of The Castle might look similar to other medieval political sims; something like Reigns or Yes, Your Grace, where you ascend the throne, rule a kingdom, and make decisions that will impact your gold reserves, military strength, or alliances. That political manoeuvring is intact in King Of The Castle, but this time up to 24 of your friends (or thousands of Twitch viewers) can join your campaign, hopping into the shoes of nobles from various regions. All of them have different goals, all of them can vote on certain decisions, and all of them have the potential to support or backstab the all-powerful monarch: you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony has announced a new collaborative initiative called PlayStation PlayMakers. The console giant will partner up with celebrity fans of the brand to “celebrate their passion for gaming and PlayStation” by creating unique experiences for players. One of those famous names is NBA superstar LeBron James, who helped design a limited-edition PlayStation 5 accessories.
The special console plates and DualSense 5 controller were co-designed by James and will release in select countries. The hardware is adorned with artistic elements (including obligatory crowns) and personal inspirational messages by LeBron. There’s no word yet on the prices, but you can only pre-order these items through direct.playstation.com. sometime this year. You can read LeBron's thoughts on the project by visiting the PlayStation Blog. 
Other big names involved with PlayStation PlayMakers include country music star Jimmie Allen, actor and comedian King Bach, and other professional athletes such as BMX’s Nigel Sylvester, WNBA All-Rookie NaLyssa Smith, NFL stars Ja’Marr Chase and CeeDee Lamb, French football freestyler Lisa Zimouche, and Belgian football star Romelu Lukaku. The initiative feels similar to McDonald's recent push of celebrity-branded menu items, so who knows what to expect from these names and others in the future.
Are you interested in grabbing LeBron James PlayStation 5 merch? Let us know in the comments!
Editors Note: a previous version of the article incorrectly stated that Sony revealed a LeBron James PS5 console instead of console accessories. We've updated the article with the correction.]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-03-01T20:07:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Telltale Games has announced that The Wolf Among Us 2 has been delayed and will now arrive in 2024. In a statement to IGN, the team explains it wants to avoid crunching the team and releasing an unfinished product as it moves development into Unreal Engine 5.
Telltale released a brief message on Twitter announcing the delay, but CEO Jamie Ottilie shares more context with IGN. Ottilie discusses the challenges of relaunching the studio in 2019, which were then compounded when the COVID-19 pandemic began the following year. That includes announcing the game when the studio was still staffing up to help secure early funding. Despite those early hurdles, Ottilie states that development has been going well since then, but the team recently decided it wants to adopt Unreal 5 to take advantage of the engine’s new features. Unfortunately, that meant having to redo a lot of the work that had been created in Unreal 4.
With such a big change, Ottilie explains that the only way The Wolf Among Us 2 could still arrive this year would be either to launch it in a less-polished state (which the team wants to avoid given its high expectations) or to overwork the staff. Given that the old Telltale was infamous for crunch and burnout, Ottilie is adamant about avoiding the same practice with this iteration of the studio. 
"I've done [crunch], and I don't want to do it again, and it's not fair to ask it," Ottilie tells IGN. "You can't plan a business around it. So yeah, part of it is about maintaining a healthy work culture. We don't want to burn out our good people.”
The Wolf Among Us 2 was announced at the 2019 Game Awards and will be an episodic title like its predecessor. However, Telltale is developing each episode at the same time, so the entire series will be complete when the first installment launches. You can watch the first full trailer from last year here. The studio’s other project, The Expanse: A Telltale Series, is still slated for this year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[“I was deranged,” says Half-Life writer Marc Laidlaw of his decision to publish the plot of Episode 3 as fanfiction. “I was living on an island, totally cut off from my friends and creative community of the last couple decades, I was completely out of touch and had nobody to talk me out of it. It just seemed like a fun thing to do… until I did it.” 


Laidlaw first discovered that community in the mid 90s, in the office of Valve, where Gabe Newell and team were already hard at work on Half-Life. “I’d seen bits and pieces of the levels they were working on, but as soon as I heard the name, I just got this amazing buzz,” Laidlaw says. “I could see the whole world they were aiming at somehow, and I felt it was a collective vision. This is one reason it’s so weird to me when people try to attribute authorship to me that I’ve never felt. It was all there when I got there, in embryo.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's a sometimes hard to define line between a game that effectively establishes and embellishes its fiction (good, righteous), and one that has "lore" (tedious, lowly). It's a delicate art that warrants close consideration. It also warrants some good examples, which brings us to ΔV: Rings Of Saturn. Which, as it gets closer to release, I'm going to be nice to and call either Delta V or Rings Of Saturn. Even though Triangle Vee Colon Rings is more fun.
It's also fun, having played it, to keep up with how it’s doing in early access, not just because I'm looking forward to seeing it take off, but because its dev has spent the last few years writing delightful patch notes in the style of in-world news bulletins.

The world’s five explorable regions – Kehjistan, Scosglen, Fractured Peaks, Dry Steppes, and Hawezar – offer their own flavors of topography, cultures, quests, and, of course, monsters. Blizzard is going to great lengths to ensure these regions are not only fun for players to explore, but feature more narrative cohesion and a stronger sense of place. 
Diablo veterans have explored regions of Sanctuary before, but this time they’re more than one-note areas highlighting a single climate or element, such as snow or desert. Each of them is biodiverse in its own right, with multiple biomes and threats exclusive to them. These realms also blend more naturally together; the lush green of one area gradually withers…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Electronic Arts has reportedly laid off more than 200 quality assurance testers at its Baton Rouge office in Lousiana. 
This news comes by way of Kotaku, which reports that EA laid off these workers, who worked primarily on the publisher's battle royale Apex Legends, during a surprise Zoom call yesterday. The publication reports that its three sources were able to confirm the news, which began making rounds on Twitter when both current and former QA testers at the Lousiana office began to share what they had learned. 
EA just fired its entire Baton Rouge studio, which is essentially their entire Apex Legends QA staff.
February 28, 2023
Kotaku reports that around 8 a.m. CT, QA testers were invited to an unscheduled but mandatory Zoom call with Magnit Global, which is the contract agency that manages the workers. It was during this meeting that the entire QA team at the Lousiana office was "disbanded," according to Kotaku. 
The publication reached out to EA looking for a response to the mass layoffs, but the publisher opted not to directly address it, instead stating that as "part of its ongoing global strategy, we are expanding the distribution of our Apex Legends testing team and ending execution that's been concentrated in Baton Rouge, Lousiana, impacting services provided by our third-party provider." Be sure to check out Kotaku's write-up for the full statement from EA and additional context surrounding the layoffs, the Lousiana office, and more.

The open-world RPG has always been playable on the portable machine, but it’s now Steam Deck verified - meaning Valve have tested it and used their almighty wisdom to determine it’ll run without a hitch.

This news comes from a report by Kotaku which says the layoffs happened over a last-minute Zoom call, according to three of their sources. EA later confirmed the news, calling the layoffs part of their “ongoing global strategy” to expand the “distribution of our Apex Legends testing team.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the best things a survival game can do is make you want to share your latest experiences with your family and friends At this, Sons Of The Forest succeeds in grand fashion. Often I found myself pausing the game so I could go find my brother and tell him about the latest Big Thing that had just happened. Some of the time, it's even for the right reasons. Perhaps I'd spotted a group of cannibals adopting some startlingly intelligent behaviour. Or maybe one of my NPC companions had just done something particularly endearing in front of me.
Or, more likely, I'd witnessed another example of the incredible jankiness which, like the island's flesh-nibbling denizens, loves to raid and pillage its way through nearly every aspect of the game. Perhaps I'd just cut down a tree and watched it soar high into the air, glitching all over the place like some demonic new type of tree mutant. Maybe Kelvin had just taken my instruction to gather logs a bit too literally, and deconstructed the entire west side of my house while I wasn't looking.
Sons Of The Forest's great strength is its ability to utterly transport you into its threatening, unsettling, but genuinely beautiful world. It quickly builds up the player's trust until they're ready to wholeheartedly buy into what at times feels like the next generation of open-world survival and crafting games. But then, at least in its current Early Access state, it breaks that trust just as quickly with a melange of unintuitive systems, game-breaking bugs, and a painful lack of content that makes one of the most gorgeous environments in games feel awfully hollow after a while.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you’ve paid any attention at all to Final Fantasy XVI, you likely already know how action-forward this game is. It’s easily the farthest a mainline Final Fantasy game has ever been from its traditional turn-based roots, with FFXVI being easily the most action-heavy yet. That’s not surprising, though, considering the game’s combat director is Ryota Suzuki, a former Capcom developer with nearly 20 years of experience designing the action in games like Marvel vs. Capcom 2, Devil May Cry 4, and most recently, Devil May Cry 5. 
With such a personal connection to Devil May Cry, I couldn’t resist asking: Who would win in a one-on-one fight: FFXVI protagonist Clive or Devil May Cry 5 lead Dante? Suzuki had to answer this question with two of his bosses right beside him – FFXVI director Hiroshi Takai and producer Naoki Yoshida – so perhaps we should take this answer with a grain of salt. But I don’t know, having played both Devil May Cry 5 and two hours of FFXVI during a recent hands-on preview (read about that here), I’m inclined to believe him. 
His answer, with a sly smile and a laugh: Clive. 
Suzuki says Clive’s Eikonic abilities, which allow him to tap into the power of Eikons like Phoenix and Titan, give him the ultimate edge. And just for fun, I asked who would win in a fight between Clive and Nero. 
“Clive.” 
There you have it, very specific fans of both Final Fantasy and Devil May Cry 5 like me; Clive wins.]]></summary>

Clive has his own style of Devil May Cry-esque combat, party members controlled by A.I. up the ante, Clive’s dog Torgal can attack enemies, Clive can fight Eikons, and there are even Eikon vs. Eikon fights. It’s a lot for one game to juggle, and after my relatively short preview, I feel that the team is confident in this balancing act. 
But I wanted to learn more, so I asked FFXVI producer Naoki Yoshida, director Hiroshi Takai, and combat director Ryota Suzuki how the team manages so many unique combat experiences.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm still not entirely sure if I'm playing Phantom Brigade right. According to its internal clock, battles usually take less than a minute. That time is divided into five-second chunks during which you're shown what the enemy will do, and must use that to coordinate your own mechs, placing their orders on a visible timeline. You finish your turn by hitting a button that makes everyone go at once for a few explosive moments.
In practice, behind those few seconds are an eternity of theorising, testing, and tweaking. There's probably a metaphor in there somewhere about writing, video editing, or catering. The result is a game that's taken me absolutely ages, but whose numbers suggest I'm supposed to be blasting through without a care.
I am enjoying it a lot, despite some frustration.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fans itching to watch Illumination’s The Super Mario Bros. Movie have two fewer days to wait. The animated film has been bumped up, releasing April 5 instead of April 7.
Why is the movie being moved up? It's unclear, but we're not complaining. The new date applies to over 60 global markets, though the Japanese premiere is set for April 28. For those wondering, April 5 lands on a Wednesday. 
Wahoo! The #SuperMarioMovie is moving from April 7 to April 5 in the US and in more than 60 markets around the world. The movie hits theaters in additional markets in April and May, with Japan opening April 28. pic.twitter.com/CjlikfC3cu

One question asked was about why the game returns to the series’ high fantasy roots, and why it has such a different tone compared to recent Final Fantasy games. 
According to Takai, it all started with summons. 

“So when the project started, I was one of the first people that [Yoshida] came to first and he said, ‘Okay, we have this project called Final Fantasy XVI. Will you be director?’ and his orders at the time of creating the game, he had this very big idea that he wanted to focus on the summons,” Takai says through a tr…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over the last few weeks I've spent a number of hours with Honkai: Star Rail's closed beta, and it certainly seems that MiHoYo's upcoming free-to-play RPG is hoping to capture a similar audience to Genshin Impact. Star Rail's turn-based battles and JRPG leanings might be a bit of a departure from Genshin's open-world adventuring, but it's definitely, 100%, without a doubt, anime as heck. Oh, and very gacha. There's a lot of currencies. So many currencies. Still, I think it's shaping up to be a decent time.

But it’s all too easy to walk past easter eggs without knowing they were even there. I’ve probably waved off multiple fun secrets, mistaking them for lore I didn’t understand or a questline I haven’t gotten to. So, my pea-sized brain enjoyed this video of game designer Steve Lee interviewing the devs behind Skyrim and Fallout as they reveal some dev secrets behind those games - including a cool egg.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know we’ve been bleating on about PC system requirements lately, but the spec demands of Kerbal Space Program 2 also demand a special, visibly uncomfortable mention. This game, fresh into early access and the sequel to one that needed a mere 512GB of VRAM, lists the formidable RTX 3080 among its recommended hardware. That’s a £600-plus graphics card, and for the bare minimum of Low quality at 1080p? That’ll be either a GTX 1070 Ti or a Radeon RX 5600 XT. 


Consternation at the star-high starting specs prompted Private Division community lead Michael Loreno to pen a forum post explaining the requirements, suggesting they were subject to change as further optimisations are added and that "the game is certainly playable on machines below our min spec." Sadly, I’ve been finding that several of the most-used GPUs among Steam users – including the immensely popular GTX 1060 – are likely to face serious performance woes in KSP2’s current state.

If my need for plants were a child, it would have been born. I had a decent pot plant called James Plant back in the UK, but when I moved I bequeathed James Plant to Graham - and, now that I think about it, Graham hasn't told me how James Plant is doing, so I should probably check in on that.
I know that digital plants do not replace real plants in a physical sense - i.e. I am getting no oxygenating benefit from them - but the little plants in Garden In! make me happy. And I've just realised the name is a pun, too.

You won’t find difficulty settings like easy, medium, and hard. Instead, there’s a story-focused mode and an action-focused mode. The story-focused mode will be easier, while the action-focused mode appears to be the default difficulty setting. And within each of these modes, there are special accessories that can be equipped to tailor the difficulty of combat to your liking.

Carson’s book investigated the pesticide known as DDT, its harmful environmental impacts, and the misinformation that allowed companies to indiscriminately use it. The Forest Cathedral reimagines this series of events as partly a first-person walking sim across the woods and partly a 2D platformer set inside scanning equipment. So, yeah, not exactly a one-to-one adaptation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This year our project was accepted to the Google Summer of Code program for the eighth year in a row (and 16th time in total).
The intention of the program is to bring new contributors to open source projects, and the eligibility rules for participants are the same as last year, with both students and non-students welcome to participate. Check the  Google Summer of Code website for details of eligibility.
Participants can apply for either short tasks (about 175 hours) or long tasks (about 350 hours). The coding period typically runs from the start of June to the end of August, but there is some flexibility and the participants can opt to use a longer coding period if they are not available to work full time on the project during the summer.
ScummVM is looking for applicants! A list of suggested projects can be found on this page, but we’re open to your own ideas too. Please make sure you provide the required information in your application before submitting. We also strongly encourage you to join our Discord server and follow the #scummvm-gsoc channel where you can engage with our mentors and the rest of the team, and get advice and help on getting started with the project and writing your application.
We have gathered some information to guide you, based on our previous 15 years of experience in the program. You may start your exploration from our Google Summer of Code miniportal.
We are looking forward to your application and participation!
