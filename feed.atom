In the debate between 1989’s Final Fight and 1991’s Streets of Rage, I’m in the latter camp. Don’t get me wrong, I love Final Fight and understand that Streets of Rage was just Sega’s answer to Capcom porting their seminal brawler to the SNES. I also realize that Streets of Rage is a blatant rip-off of Final Fight. However, I just love the sense of style and the fact that it’s better suited to consoles.
However, Streets of Rage doesn’t have Mike Haggar, former pro-wrestler and beloved mayor of Metro City. Haggar is amazing not just because he’s built like a pizza oven, but also because his backstory is so sparse you can apply whatever features you want onto him. Is he a mayor who only knows how to address crime with his fists? Maybe. Or perhaps he was working on addressing crim…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Prepare to have your fuzzies warmed.
What exactly makes a game cozy? Is it the player's state of mind while playing? Is it an adherence to specific aesthetics or messages? Is it the inclusion of birds? Well, you might be forgiven for thinking it's the last one, because at least ten of the games on this list are about birds specifically, but the idea of a "cozy" game is a bit more nebulous than that.
It's more of a feeling, really: a game that you can relax to, that can be challenging but never punishing, with elements of friendship, community, and kindness. But not always — some "cozy" games (like a certain game about a bad goose) are more about letting the player go a little bit wild, but always in a way that's gentler and less severe than chopping people's heads off in a Dark Souls or a Witcher game.

The Devil's Moon event for excellent cowboy swamp simulator Hunt Showdown kicks off on December 14th, no doubt sending players off to squish environmental objects for points that unlock new weapons and cosmetics in the manner of previous events. This one is different, though, in that it also introduces a "wildcard condition" called Inferno that sets large swathes of the map on fire. It is dramatic. Come see.

Dragon Quest Treasures has finally arrived for Nintendo Switch, and with a 77 score on Metacritic as of this writing, most reviewers seem to think it's a pretty good time. In my review, I found it to be a delightful way to pass the hours with a charming world and addictive gameplay. And as much as I do like the game, I'm aware that it doesn't exactly do the best job of informing the player of everything they can do in it. Some things you'll only learn via hint screens or in passing dialogue, so to better help those treasure hunters who are starting their journeys today, I thought I'd collect seven Dragon Quest Treasures tips to get you going the right way.

I have a Switch. And I have a Steam Deck. I am a fancy lady with two consoles designed for the kind of people who really like to be horizontal when playing games, which suits me just fine, because I am often to be found being horizontal and/or playing games. But I see a lot of folks pitting my two expensive rectangles against one another, and although I can see why, I don't agree that comparisons are the most helpful way to look at the two of them.
The Steam Deck and the Switch are not exactly apples and oranges, or chalk and chocolate, or whatever your favourite incomparables are. After all, they're both the same shape. They both play games. And Valve's portable-ish console is clearly modelled after the Switch, anyway.

Supergiant Games is working on Hades II, its first-ever sequel, as it confirmed at last night's Game Awards. The reveal trailer has tons of tidbits, details, and plenty of new gods and goddesses to see.
The first Hades received a lot of acclaim, due in part to how it interpreted Greek myth into Superigant's version of the Underworld. For Hades II, that doesn't seem to have changed.

In a new FAQ about Hades II, Supergiant shares some details about what it's calling a direct sequel to the first Hades. And while mythology is certainly back in focus, Supergiant's turned towards one specific area: witchcraft.

It's knuckle-up time, as developer Sloclap has released a new update for its time-hopping brawler Sifu — The fall update, now available on all platforms, adds several new features, skins, and game modifiers for the super-challenging beat-'em-up adventure.
The core of the new update lies in an exciting new Replay Editor, which will let players take a directorial eye to their highlight reels of window-smashing, chair-tossing carnage. The editor features a free-moving camera, cut 'n' copy tools, speed modifiers, and visual effects, all of which might not quite have you recreating the best fist-throwing flick since Yes, Madam, but will allow you to showcase your finest fights at the heart-stopping best. Annnnnnd ACTION!

In addition to the replay editor, the Sifu Fall update also includes a selection of brand-new game modifiers. These include the youth-sapping "Vampire" mode, a "Free Throw" option for all you grappler fans, and the mighty "Touch of Death" modifier for Bruce Lee-style one-punch knockouts. Three new outfits have also been added to the protagonist's wardrobe, including two versions of the "Wing Chung" ensemble, and a bonus "Stunt Double" outfit for Deluxe Edition owners — which contains the perfect jacket for those late-night drives.
Sifu is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Nintendo Switch.

Okay, maybe that's just my bad decisions talking. You're stranded on a wrecked space station after a failed pirate attack, and must get back to your ship. It's not super secret, but I almost don't want to say more than that, because this is a game overflowing with possibilities in a way that even Fallout seldom matched. It is not quite ready, but if the bugs can be ironed out, and perhaps more crucially, the save system reorganised, this could easily become one of the best RPGs of its kind.

You wait decades for a brand-new Dune video game, and then two come along at once! Yes in addition to the 2022 strategy title Dune: Spice Wars, Funcom has released pre-alpha footage of an upcoming MMO set within the arrid planes of Arrakis: Dune: Awakening.
As demonstrated at yesterday's Game Awards, Dune: Awakening will see players the world over attempt to thrive, or merely survive, in the cut-throat dystopian world of Frank Herbert's iconic sci-fi series. Starting out as a desperate survivor wandering the hazardous horizons, players will guide their custom characters in a quest for shelter, water, defense, companionship, and the ultimate desire of the Arrakian world: Spice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixq-y_r-lkE&ab_channel=Funcom
From there, savvy survivalists will be able to build and trade among their local community, gain favor of the Great Houses, build and equip an arsenal of weaponry, work with spice harvesting corporations, and build themselves up among the corporations and nobility that holds fort over the lucrative lands. Of course, you might just get eaten by a sandworm on your first day — which honestly sounds like less work and perhaps the better option.
Funcom notes that it will roll out further trailers and gameplay overviews over the coming months, giving players a general overview of Dune: Awakening's gameplay, options, and features ahead of its official beta launch. A date for the beta was not announced, but we do know that Dune: Awakening is currently in development for PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X. So you'd better get your house in order.

The chest has been opened, and Dragon Quest Treasures has finally launched on the Switch today, 9th December.
Originally proposed as an entry in the spin-off series Dragon Quest Monsters, Treasures sees fan-favourite character from Dragon Quest XI — Erik — and his little sister Mia embark on an adventure to uncover the Dragon Stones. It takes all of the charm and lightheartedness that the Dragon Quest series is known for and amps it up to eleven.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We’re approaching the end of 2022, and we’re concluding the year by going back to our Super Replay roots by tackling an old-school survival horror game. In this case, we’re replaying one of the greatest games of the PS1 era, Silent Hill! Join us live on Twitch today at 2:30 p.m. Central as we endure two hours of nostalgic, hair-raising scares. If you can’t catch us live, each episode will be available to watch on Saturdays on the Game Informer Shows YouTube channel. 
In 1999, Konami put the fear of fog in a generation of players with the release of Silent Hill. The eerie title eschewed the more bombastic horror of its main rival at the time, Resident Evil, in favor of more psychological frights. Protagonist Harry Mason must embark on a terrifying search for his missing daughter, Cheryl, within the eerie town of Silent Hill. What unfolds is a descent into madness that kickstarted a franchise that's (finally) returning to the limelight after years of dormancy. Join me, Marcus Stewart, along with Kyle Hilliard, as we survive Silent Hill’s debut adventure and see how its scares stack up 23 years later.
Watch on Twitch!
If you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes. You’ll also be granted entry to the official Game Informer Discord channel, where our welcoming community members, moderators, and staff gather to talk games, entertainment, food, and organize hangouts!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I haven't been active in fandom spaces for years now, but lurking on the edges of social media forums dedicated to games I find cool does technically fall under the remit of my job. And let me tell you, the lead-up to a night like The Game Awards is always something else. Fringes of the Tomb Raider fanbase were getting hyped for the announcement of the next game because… well, it just feels like about time, right? The same went for Life Is Strange, but then, Life Is Strange fans have been predicting the imminent reveal of LIS3 literally on a weekly basis ever since True Colors launched, so they're bound to be right eventually. Ace Attorney stans were using numerology to predict that AA7 would finally get announced. Incredible scenes of completely baseless hype, and despite myself, I wanted to believe.
I genuinely daren't check in on any of those conversations today, because, honestly, it wasn't a massive night for long-running franchises, and I don't think I can handle the lamentations. And, while I'll admit that my initial skim of the trailers for familiar names came up a tad short, I'm not at all disappointed, because it looks like 2023 is going to be a stellar year for devs doing something cool with a new IP while learning a lot from their older projects.

Alongside the news that The Last of Us Part I is coming to PC in March 2023, Sony also took time at The Game Awards to offer a release window for a PC port of Housemarque's dazzling space adventure, Returnal — As revealed in a short trailer, the time-skipping title will hit Steam and Epic Games Store in early 2023.
Launching in April 2021 as a showcase piece for the burgeoning PS5 platform, Returnal is the story of an intrepid space explorer, Selene, who crash lands on a mysterious planet, playing host to the remnants of some lost, undiscovered civilization. Meeting an untimely end soon after jettisoning her spacecraft, Selene finds herself resurrected back in its cockpit, doomed to relive life, after life, after life until she can uncover the mystery behind this strange world and, hopefully, find her way back home.

Developed by shmup enthusiasts Housemarque, Returnal combines the team's love of bullet hell gameplay with its proven talent for creating eye-popping visuals, dramatic lightning effects, and wide palette of splendid colors, in order to create a compelling third-person adventure. Celebrated for its challenging action, lush environments, and intriguing story of self-reflection, Returnal was an early hit for Sony's fancy new hardware and was almost custom-made for the splendor and power of the PC platform.
Returnal launches on PC via Steam and Epic Games Store in early 2023.

In the spirit of the holidays, the group reconvened to tackle another literary classic: Charles Dickens’ A Christmas Carol, benefitting a children's hospital.

If you're gagging for some more Aloy action, then Guerrilla Games has you covered, as the studio has revealed a new expansion, currently in the works for the PS5 edition of Horizon Forbidden West — The new "Burning Shores" DLC was revealed during The Game Awards yesterday evening.
A brief trailer, which you can check out below, sees our spritely hero as she soars through the skies astride her trusty Sunwing. From there, she approaches a lush but swamped island, located south of the Tenakth Clan Lands. Upon approach, we the audience realize that our girl has wandered into a dystopian aftermath that was once Los Angeles, but has now become little more than a volcanic archipelago, littered with further threats charged by the force of "The Machines".
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShJuY6Zl2Aw&ab_channel=PlayStation
According to the development team, Burning Shores will feature extended travel by land, sea, and air — offering players a brand-new location that can be fully explored via all three methods. Aloy will also find herself up against a terrifying new mechanical behemoth, which appears to be some form of crustacean hybrid if the splash art is anything to go by. According to Guerrilla, the scale of the DLC — in both size and visual fidelity — has led the team to focus on the PS5 platform only, suggesting that the new expansion will not be developed for PS4.
Horizon Forbidden West is available now on PlayStation platforms — The Burning Shores DLC will launch on PS5 only on April 19, 2023.

As spotted by Serebii, this is now no longer the case, as basic Pokémon cards based on Scarlet and Violet will now feature a silver coloured border to bring the western designs in line with the Japanese variants. Now, we're not going to lie, we think the silver border looks much better; the yellow design looked pretty nice back in the day, but by modern standards, it's a little bit cheap looking.

When Choo-Choo Charles was first revealed to the world, I got that too-good-to-be-true feeling. Sure, it looked like a lot of fun, but how do you build an entire game around fighting an evil train? I was then reminded that I thought the same thing about Happy’s Humble Burger Farm, which coincidentally was released about one year ago. Will Choo-Choo Charles become my next horror obsession?
No.
But that’s not as damning as it seems. In fact, if there’s one thing I really respect about Choo-Choo Charles, it’s that it knows exactly what it is and is focused on delivering that. And it does.

The debut of Splatoon 3's new recurring event, Big Run, has felt like a long time coming, but today (9th December) the wait is finally over. Kicking off at 4pm PT (those of us in Europe will have to wait until the early hours of the morning on the 10th) those pesky Salmonids are heading for Wahoo World and it's up to us to stop them.
First announced in the Chill Season 2022 promo last month, Big Run looks like it will run along similar lines to the game's Splatfests. Every once in a while there will be a mass Salmonid attack on a Turf War stage and the weekend will then be a wall-to-wall race to keep them at bay.

At the time I'd been in the market for a new – and entirely necessary - underfoot experience, so I turned to a local Carpet Man to procure said plush. In the end he seemed pleased that I rebelled against the majority and opted for a sunny corn colour.
But the latest Armored Core VI trailer from this year's Geoff Awards had me in a contemplative mood. "Perhaps", I thought, "Carpet Man would appreciate FromSoftware's use of grey". Even though there isn't a fuzzy floor surface to be seen, could the trailer have triggered grey's redemption arc?

Not to the extent that I will ever bother to learn anything about them, or to identify one with any more specificity than “the pointy type”, “the blunt type” and “the chugga chugga choo choo all-aboard type”, but to the far milder extent that I simply enjoy watching them whizz around the place like big metal worms, and hearing their various little noises and honks. It’s trains! 
Just as a train might be lured into a station with the promise of fresh passengers (which are like treats to trains), I have been drawn inexorably toward Choo-Choo Charles, a ramshackle joke-game about a scary train that chases you around. Marooned on a perpetually dark island, you’re stalked by a monstrous locomotive with a set of great big spider legs and an unquenchable thirst for human blood.

This is why I will often specifically advise people to never, ever pitch me opinions about BioShock. Any opinions about BioShock have already been had. There are no more opinions to have about it.

My state of peace in this area was just scuppered by that utter bastard Ken Levine, the creative director and writing lead on both BioShock and BioShock Infinite, when he revealed some of the new game by his studio Ghost Story Games (aka The Developers Formerly Known As Irrational). As observed by everyone who saw the reveal at The Game Awards last night, Judas is basically BioShock in space. The bad news is that this will put more fuel in Thomas The Take Engine, but the good news is that, if it is indeed like BioShock, we can save ourselves a lot of time. When Judas comes out please just return to this article and insert a specific title and delete options as applicable.

Spring, perhaps best known for its bright lights, sweet flowers, and promise of a sparkling new year, will find itself a little clouded over in the coming year, following the news that brutal misery fest The Last of Us Part I will be making its way to PC, (via Steam) on March 3, 2023.
As announced during yesterday evening's Game Awards, Naughty Dog's critically acclaimed (if somewhat expensive) remake will be making the leap from PS5 to desktops everywhere, offering PC players the chance to check out its modernized gameplay mechanics, overhauled controls, and stunning visual clarity — not to mention its hugely impressive range of new accessibility options.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LW5NwaUXgIA&ab_channel=PlayStation
The Last of Us Part I is the definitive edition of the award-winning 2013 release — a grim tale of two survivors thrust together within a rapidly decaying world. Celebrated for its gut-punch storytelling, frightening array of mutants, and claustrophobic atmosphere, The Last of Us would be remastered for PS4 just one year later, before receiving the full remake treatment in September of this year.
The Last of Us Part I launches on PC March 3, 2023 with pre-orders now live on Steam. Additionally, Netflix's live-action adaptation, The Last of Us, will hit the streaming service on January 15, 2023.

The lead developer, Conrad, has now issued a full video statement claiming that these problems stem from a difficult relationship with the game's publisher. While the partnership has been dissolved in the ensuing week, the developer claims that the publishing studio is continuing to profit from the situation.

Samurai Maiden’s characters look great. Really great. While perhaps not leaps and bounds ahead of the competition, nevertheless, they’re a striking cast of multicoloured, glassy-eyed femme fatales that glow from every angle. As is much the case with most output that falls into anime ecchi categories, they’re not particularly deep or interesting characters, with surface-level personalities ripped, well, straight from a cartoon. But that’s not why you’re here, is it? Hell no, you’re in it for the pantsu, and that’s one area Samurai Maiden delivers in aplomb.
Before we get assaulted in the comments section for ragging on people who enjoy this kind of media, let it be known we actually like Samurai Maiden quite a lot. It may have all the staple hallmarks of the ecchi genre, including a plot that’s been written on the back of a train ticket, but as a game, it does very well.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last night at The Game Awards, Raw Fury and developers Red Soul Games released a new look at the indie horror Post Trauma. The paranormal game leans heavily into the PSX generation of survival horrors, with its fixed camera angles and even optional tank controls. The developers describe it as "both a tribute and a modern take on classic horror games."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Better start defrosting those windscreens.
We are nearing the end of the Peach Vs. Bowser Tour in Mario Kart Tour which means - like clockwork - the mobile game team is quick on the draw to let us know what goodies are coming our way next.
It turns out that the next tour in the game will see things take a turn for the festive (who would have thought it). The 'Holiday Tour' sets off on 12th December (or 13th if your are on PT) and will bring with it the return of Mario Kart: Super Circuit's Snow Land. Looking at the trailer (below) we think it's fair to say that this snowy course has had a bit of a makeover from its GBA days - looking much closer to the version that we saw on Mario Kart 8 Deluxe.

If there's one thing that we can't help but find endearing about Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, it's how the creatures out in the wild appear true to size. If you saw a rodent-like creature that was the size of, let's say, a dog, then you would be pretty freaked and we like the fact that the latest entry addresses that. What's more, this idea seems to be spreading as Pokémon GO is now following suit (or at least, it's starting to).
As a part of a new feature, certain wild Pokémon in the mobile game have been given two new size variants: XXS and XXL. This means that if you come across a Poochyena, Mightyena or Mawile, you stand a chance of catching one that is a little bigger, or indeed smaller, than what you might expect. Give it up for the little guys everyone!

The Lords Of The Fallen was previously announced as a reboot to the 2014 game of almost the same name (they added a The this time), although it now seems to be a sort-of sequel. Judging from this trailer the devs would be quite happy if someone thought it was Dark Souls 4 by mistake.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Prepare those twitchy thumbs
If, like my good self, you found yourself enraptured by the fantastic 2018 platformer Celeste, then you'll be Extremely OK with this brand new trailer for Earthblade, which premiered as a part of yesterday evening's Game Award festivities.
Dripping with simplistic style, as only Team Celeste know how, Earthblade will follow the adventures of Nevoa, Child of Fate, as they return to what remains of a ruined Earth in what looks to be another pixelated tale packed with challenges on a physical and emotional scale. According to EXOK, Earthblade will feature seamless exploration, engaging combat, and "countless mysteries", as Nevoa explores the world, meets friend and foe, and overcomes numerous obstacles in their search for answers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafFds3Ppb0
From this conceptual trailer, it seems that Earthblade will feature a more typical open-world adventure experience akin to something like Team Cherry's Hollow Knight. But the recognizable charm and style of EXOK Games are readily apparent here. From the ethereal music and forlorn atmosphere to its intriguing character design — detailed in such simplicity — and the heavy leanings toward multi-directional world traversal and the satisfaction of the journey itself. I'll definitely be keeping an eye on this one, and fans of the strange and fantastical would do well to do the same.
Earthblade is currently in development for PC. It is scheduled to launch sometime in 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Crash & The Boys (and Girls)
At The Game Awards 2022, Activision announced a brand new title set in the zany, madcap world of Crash Bandicoot — but unlike the typical 3D platformers for which the series is renowned, Crash Team Rumble will instead see the series' colorful cast square off in a bout of multiplayer madness.
Crash Team Rumble, currently in development for PlayStation and Xbox, will see Crash, Coco, Tawna, Dr. Cortex, and many other heroes and villains from the beloved series battle it out in 4-v-4 team-based action. Players will race to gather Wumpa Fruit for their squad, racing back to bank it in their home base while defending their stock from the opposing team and getting into frenzied melee scraps out on the battlefield. Each character will be afforded their own special skills and bespoke abilities, so teamwork and character synergy will be the key to claiming victory.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=becrLd9GOB4&ab_channel=CrashBandicoot
"We’re so excited to unveil our fresh new take on multiplayer in the Crash universe with Crash Team Rumble," said Toys for Bob's Paul Yan in a press release. "Crash Team Rumble has something for everyone— easy pick-up and play for those who just want to jump in, while also providing skilled gamers the opportunity to leverage and master their hero’s unique abilities."
While not quite the long-rumored Super Smash Bros. clone that people have been expecting, this all-new take on the wild 'n' wacky world of Crash could prove to be a pretty neat party title, and feels more in the vein of a Splatoon than a Smash Bros. I don't see my boy Ripper Roo just yet, but I do see my mirror image, (Dingodile), so I guess I've found my main already.
Crash Team Rumble will launch in 2023 on PlayStation and Xbox platforms.

Tekken fans got a fresh new look at Bandai Namco's exciting new fighter Tekken 8 during last night's Game Awards festivities. A new trailer offered up new hints on the sequel's highly dramatic narrative, while also sneaking in glimpses of several combatants returning to The King of Iron Fist Tournament.
The preview sees Kazuya Mishima, now fully possessed by the Devil gene, running amok throughout the planet, raining destruction down on its populace. Standing against him will be the newly-reformed Jin Kazama, charged with the blood in his veins and the spirit of his deceased mother in his heart. The preview is a pretty melodramatic affair, as one would expect from the Tekken franchise — but I'll be darned if it didn't make the Tekken 8 storyline look like a pretty cataclysmic affair.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tXTWVncFP4&t=77s&ab_channel=BandaiNamcoEntertainmentAmerica
In addition to the plot details, the trailer also featured some returning Tekken acolytes, including the fiery pro-wrestler, King, the man-mountain android Jack, Bruce-Lee-alike Marshall Law, his running buddy Paul Phoenix and the far-too-handsome-to-be-a-special agent Lars. We also catch a sneak peek at Jun Kazama herself, suggesting that she too will be making her return to the ring. All of this was rendered in dazzling current-gen technology, offering visual splendor yet to be seen in the long-running series. It's looking good. Damn good.
Tekken 8 is currently in development for PS5. PC, and Xbox Series X.

[Update: As noted in this evening's Game Awards, a Forspoken demo is now available for download on PS5. A new trailer was also premiered, which you can check out below.]
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQYHXpkX6kM&ab_channel=SquareEnix
[Original Article]
As is often the case in the lead-up to The Game Awards, several rumors and leaks are floating around the information superhighway ahead of Keighley's grand festivities — Case in point: a tweet published by the Japanese PlayStation Twitter, pointing to an incoming demo for Square Enix adventure Forspoken.
The (now deleted) tweet sported some attractive new splash art, emblazoned with the words "Demo Announcement Trailer". The sudden removal of the tweet suggests that said video is cued to play during tonight's live TGA presentation. The deleted tweet also referenced an 11-minute Forspoken gameplay showcase, which will likely be hosted on the official PlayStation YouTube channel tomorrow, December 9, as part of Forspoken's continuing "Deep Dive" video series.
https://twitter.com/Renka_schedule/status/1600756189943410689?s=20&t=8d2Qc74adzfu6ObMzVeGKQ
While Forspoken has had something of an inauspicious start, with online jokesters mocking its marketing strategy and critics raising an eyebrow at some admittedly foolish PR speak, I personally think that Forspoken is an attractive title with potential. A 2023 GOTY contender? maybe not, but it could certainly prove a fun way to kick off 2023's gaming year. No doubt Square Enix hopes that allowing players to get their hands on a playable build, giving them the opportunity to explore Athia and meet hero Frey Holland — will help turn around some of this early cynicism ahead of the title's impending release.
Forspoken launches January 24 on PS5 and PC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Final Fantasy 16 got a fiery new trailer tonight, as well as a final release date of June 22nd 2023. At least that's the date for PS5 players. For us folks on PC, tonight's Game Awards trailer confirmed in tiny small print that Square Enix's next JRPG epic won't be landing on "other platforms" until December 31st 2023 at the earliest. So, unless Squeenix are going to deliver us a belated Christmas New Year special next year, I think it's safe to assume that FF16's PC release won't be available to summon until 2024. Still, based on what we've seen in its new "Revenge" trailer tonight, I reckon it will be well worth the wait.

I’ve been a card-carrying Transformers fan since Generation 1, so I’m somewhat confused by the trailer shown at The Game Awards tonight for Gears studio Splash Damage’s upcoming co-op action game Transformers: Reactivate. Yes, theoretically any rather large robot that changes shape counts as a Transformer. Possibly a GoBot, I’m not going to judge anyone on their lifestyle. Just watch the trailer below and tell me what you think, go on.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Summer hatin', happened so fast
The final reveal at The Game Awards is one I know many of our readers have been champing at the bit for. Yoshi-P took the stage before the Game of the Year award was handed out to drop a new trailer for Final Fantasy XVI. Like with each of the game's previous trailers, this thing looks incredible and is bound to grab a few nominees at next year's award show.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GOtYqLkj2g
Of course, the most important thing about that trailer is the announcement of the release date. The Final Fantasy XVI release date is June 22, 2023. And remember, it's coming exclusively to PlayStation 5.
Since the game was originally announced, we've learned quite a bit about the upcoming action RPG. For starters, the game will not be open-world and will instead use a collection of large, explorable areas. Yoshi-P has also taken to the press to talk about the overall direction of the series moving away from its turn-based origins to become arguably the premier action RPG series in the world.
Final Fantasy XVI will be the first mainline entry in the storied series in nearly seven years. That's a long time to wait, but with Yoshi-P at the helm, I believe it will have been worth it.

Tonight at The Game Awards, the studio revealed a new entry in its mech shooter franchise: Armored Core IV: Fires of Rubicon. 
A cinematic trailer set the table, which begins on a rather gloomy (and lava-filled) note before the mechs emerge to kick up the tempo a few notches. Fires of Rubicon is the first entry in the series since 2013’s Armored Core: Verdict Day, so fans have waited a long time for tonight’s news. Check out the trailer below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While the new trailer for the upcoming expansion of Cyberpunk 2077 starts out with some voice lines from Keanu Reeves, the surprise appearance comes from a newly revealed character. Solomon Reed appears as a new figure played by Idris Elba.
Few concrete details are apparent from the trailer, but the spirit and visual styling of Cyberpunk 2077 remains in clear evidence. We know that Phantom Liberty is built as a spy-thriller set in a new district of Night City and that V somehow works together with the government of the New United States of America, and presumably alongside the newly revealed Solomon Reed.
Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty is set for release in 2023 on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.]]></summary>

The studio behind the Souls series is returning to another part of its roots. FromSoftware has confirmed it's working on Armored Core VI Fires of Rubicon.
Revealed tonight at The Game Awards 2022, Armored Core VI Fires of Rubicon sees the studio return to the mech series with some serious production value. Check out the trailer below to get an idea for yourself:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKO1s-CUZvY
The new Armored Core entry is currently set for a 2023 launch. The trailer splash shows both PlayStation 4 and Xbox One alongside PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Steam.
A return to a classic series
It's been a while since FromSoftware went back to the Armored Core series. The mech action lineage started in 997 on the PlayStation, and carried on through Armored Core: Verdict Day in 2013.
The early entries of Armored Core are certainly well-remembered. But as sentiment waned on newer releases, the series took a backseat. With the Souls games taking off, FromSoftware followed their trajectory, leading up to games like this year's Game Awards heavyweight Elden Ring.

FromSoftware has certainly earned enough goodwill from fans to revisit the series. I'm looking forward to seeing how those who jumped on with the Souls series take to the giant mechs and action of Armored Core. As someone who played a good few of them on his PlayStation 2 back in the era, I'm certainly keen to see what FromSoft does with this series years later.
Armored Core VI Fires of Rubicon is currently slated for 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Publisher CI Games and developer Hexworks have released a new trailer for its upcoming sequel, The Lords of the Fallen, and it's another dark and terrifying look at the Soulslike series. 
Lords of the Fallen was released back in 2014, and GI Games revealed its long-awaited sequel, The Lords of the Fallen, during Gamescom's Opening Night Live back in August. A new trailer showcasing another look at the world of this sequel was released during The Game Awards 2022 tonight, and while it only featured a few glimpses of gameplay, it seems The Lords of the Fallen is shaping up to be a worthy successor. 
Watch The Lords of the Fallen gameplay teaser below: 


The Lords of the Fallen is set 1,000 years after the original Lords of the Fallen, and it's been designed with cooperative play in mind, according to Hexworks. Two players can play together in uninterrupted online play and experience an "expansive RPG experience filled with NPC quests, compelling characters, and rich narrative," according to a press release from earlier this year. 
The Lords of the Fallen will be released on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. A release date has not yet been revealed, but it's due out sometime in 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Activision has announced Crash Team Rumble, a 4v4 team-based online multiplayer game starring Crash Bandicoot and his furry/scaly friends. The game sees Toys for Bob, the studio behind Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time, step back into the developer role for the Crash Bandicoot series, but with a decidedly different approach in tow.
Crash Team Rumble puts players in the shoes of Crash, Dingodile, and the Bandicoot's stable of friends and enemies. Each character has their own powers, personality, and playstyle as they duke it out in 4v4 competitions across a wide array of arenas. The teams compete in a variety of activities to bank the most Wumpa fruit in their drop-off zone while simultaneously defending it.
"We're so excited to unveil our fresh new take on multiplayer in the Crash universe with Crash Team Rumble," Paul Yan, co-studio head at Toys for Bob said in a press release. "Crash Team Rumble has something for everyone – easy pick-up and play for those who just want to jump in, while also providing skilled gamers the opportunity to leverage and master their hero's unique abilities."
You can see the reveal trailer below.


Crash Team Rumble comes to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One in 2023. The game features cross-platform play, so you thankfully won't need to coordinate with friends or agonize over which version to pick up.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dontnod Entertainment has revealed their next game: Banishers: Ghosts of a New Eden. While Dontnod is known best for its work on the Life is Strange series, Banishers is an action/RPG, and it might share more in common with the studio's 2018 game Vampyr. For a better look at the game, check out the teaser below.


In the reveal trailer, a man sits across the table from a woman, holding her hand. Another person in the room calls the man a banisher, one who hunts ghosts. Then, the woman at the table dissolves away into a blue light, indicating that she was a ghost the whole time. Afterward, we get a glimpse at what gameplay might look like, with the man and his ghostly companion leaping into battle with an undead creature called a bonewalker.
Outside that brief trailer, we got a release window. Near the end of 2023, Banishers: Ghosts of a New Eden will come to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.]]></summary>

I've made it a rule to try and avoid writing about game announcements that are nothing but CGI trailers and I'm going to break that rule right now. One of the more curious announcements from The Game Awards was for a new Transformers game called Transformers: Reactivate. 
From developer Splash Damage, Reactivate will be a 1-4 player online action game planned for PC and consoles. In the game, a team of human survivors will Autobots to fight back against an extinction-level threat. The short blurb on the game's website mentions "salvage" which leads me to believe you'll be customizing your Autobot or Autobots.

Sadly, it's still just a CGI trailer. Hopefully, we'll get a better look at what Splash Damage has in store before Transformers: Reactivate enters Early Access next year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A reimagined classic sets out next month
Ken and Roberta Williams' 3D interpretation of the classic Colossal Cave is set to launch next month. Colossal Cave will go live on January 19, 2023.
Announced tonight at The Game Awards 2022, the new version of this adventure is coming to Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Windows PC and Mac, and the Meta Quest 2. Previous generation consoles, the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, are expected to get Colossal Cave sometime in Q1 2023.
This 3D version of Colossal Cave is based on the original Colossal Cave Adventure, a classic text adventure game. Sierra On-Line co-founders Ken and Roberta Williams have taken that classic and made it 3D, moving from words and descriptions into full-on environments. There's still a narrator though, to capture some of that original feel.
The goal is to traverse the cave, collect items, and return home safe and sound. Simple, it may seem, until you realize how much danger awaits in the cave.

Find the treasure and escape the cave
Getting a new version of a classic is something that happens quite often in games. But for both this particular game, and the developers behind it, Colossal Cave feels like a cool way to  honor the long legacy games have built up over the years.
I'm fascinated to dig into the cave for myself. This was a segment of PC gaming I never got around to, and it's been re-imagined by developers who have a lot of respect for the era. And Colossal Cave being playable in virtual reality on the Meta Quest 2 is pretty neat, too. This is a neat convergence point of gaming history to kick off 2023.

The long-in-development action/RPG is finally nearing release, and we got a confirmed release date this evening. You’ll be able to confront demons to your heart’s content beginning on June 6, 2023.
While the trailer didn’t offer a wealth of new details about the game, it did show off a pretty epic battle between the forces of Heaven and Hell. The forces seem to be led by Tyrael on one side and Lilith on the other side, and two massive armies clash over the course of the battle.

However, if you were hoping to get in on some PC / console crossplay action regarding the game's multiplayer, you may be disappointed, as publisher Sega confirmed to me today that they have "no plans to support crossplay between PC and consoles for multiplayer at launch".

Those cel-shaded visuals instantly got my attention when the new trailer for free-to-play MMORPG Blue Protocol popped up at The Game Awards this evening - and that Hiroyuki Sawano soundtrack ain't bad either (that's one for the Gundam Unicorn and Attack On Titan fans out there). It's being developed by Bandai Namco, but for some reason New World and Lost Ark publisher Amazon Games will be the ones bringing the MMO to the west in the second half of 2023. Either way, you can watch the trailer below and repeat my own very succinct inner monologue, if you like. Repeat after me: “Ooh, cel-shading. Nice.”

The deepest dungeons and demon-infested catacombs are open for business again next year. Blizzard Entertainment will launch Diablo IV on June 6, 2023.
The latest dungeon-crawler from the Blizzard crew revealed the date at tonight's Game Awards 2022. Tonight's cinematic trailer includes a lot of evil demons, one shining warrior in particular, and plenty of doom and gloom.

Back into the dungeons
Ever since the reveal of Diablo IV at BlizzCon 2019, there has been speculation of when we might finally see the latest Diablo emerge. Rumors have bounced around, and Blizzard itself had to temper expectations as to when it might arrive. A sizable leak of the game dropped not too long ago though, adding more fuel to the fire.
It's all happened as Activision Blizzard has been caught up in a storm of events. The lawsuits, the still-pending acquisition of Activision Blizzard by Microsoft, and unionization of the QA team at Blizzard Albany have all transpired between that 2019 reveal and now.
Adding on top of the pile is a report published today from The Washington Post. In it, employees at Activision Blizzard tell the Post that the June 6 date will be hard to meet without working significant overtime. Sources allege mismanagement, including crunch that's incentivized by company stock shares and DoorDash credits. There are also details about a previous version of Diablo IV's script that involved the rape of a female love interest, in order to have a grittier tone. Employees reportedly fought it, and eventually managed to get this version of the story revised.
Basically, a lot has gone down since that first reveal, and it sounds like development has been troubled, to say the least. We did get some recent hands-on impressions, and it seems like things are coming together. But there's a lot of baggage hanging over this sequel now, headed into an actual launch.

Nintendo is planning to start 2023 off with a bang with the release of Fire Emblem Engage. The follow-up to the excellent Fire Emblem: Three Houses sees Alear, a Devine Dragon, awaken after 1,000 years of slumber to gather the Emblem Rings that have been spread across the continent of Elyos. Taking a page from Fire Emblem Heroes, Engage is leaning big into the franchise's legacy with classic characters appearing in the game. That'll continue with the season pass as well. As revealed at The Game Awards, the Fire Emblem Engage Season Pass will bring your classmates from Three Houses into the mix, as well as series staple Tiki.

As revealed on Twitter, the Fire Emblem Engage season pass will consist of four waves of content. Starting on January 20, those who buy the DLC will get Edelgard, Dimitri, Claude, and Tiki, as well as support items, in-game accessories, and whatever the heck the silver card is. Hopefully, this is a good indicator of what fans can expect from the remaining waves of content.
Fire Emblem Engage also launches on January 20, 2023. So gives me about five weeks to finally make my way through the Cindered Shadows storyline in the Three Houses DLC.

Airship Syndicate is teaming up with the studio behind Warframe for a new multiplayer title. Wayfinder is a co-op action RPG that mixes fantasy and tech for some co-op action RPG adventures.
Revealed at tonight's Game Awards 2022, Wayfinder is a new action RPG for PC and consoles, aiming for 2023. Creative director Joe "Mad" Madureira, of Battle Chasers fame, is at the helm with Airship Syndicate. Digital Extremes, the company behind Warframe, is publishing.
Wayfinder is set in the world of Evenor, which is gradually being consumed by Gloom. Wayfinders (the players) take up the mantle and fight the Gloom, working to fight back against its spread together.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYFU7jrMAIM
Each Wayfinder has their own unique story to explore and play style to utilize. You can collect and craft gear to improve your loadout, while also boosting up your character themselves. Runs can be customized with unique modifiers and challenges to offer special hunting and gathering chances.

The draw is multiplayer, and it looks like you can set out with a pretty decently sized party. Alongside fighting the Gloom, there's also an at-home customization element with the player's Apartment.
Finding a way forward
While Airship Syndicate and Digital Extremes are aiming for 2023 on PC and console, you'll potentially be able to play Wayfinder before the year's out. A closed playtest is being held for Wayfinder starting on Tuesday, December 13. If you want to try it out, you can head over to the Wayfinder PC playtest sign-ups here. Meanwhile, PlayStation playtests will be held in January.
Then, in spring 2023, the duo of Airship and Extremes aims to launch Wayfinder into Early Access on PC and PlayStation. A free-to-play full launch is expected to follow in fall 2023, and embrace Digital Extremes' "free-and-fair" monetization policy, according to a press release.

After several years in development and Early Access, Larian Studios is locking in a launch window for Baldur's Gate 3. The next entry in the RPG series will arrive sometime in August 2023.
Revealed at The Game Awards 2022, tonight's trailer showed off more of what's to come in the next Baldur's Gate. From old faces to new surprises, it seems like a lot.
Throughout the trailer, we see looks at what's in store beyond the currently available Early Access version of Baldur's Gate 3. While an excursion to the actual location of Baldur's Gate is one thing, there are also some familiar faces in store too.
Both Jaheira and Minsc appear in the latest look at Baldur's Gate 3. These two were companion characters in Baldur's Gate II. Jaheira has aged thanks to the years since BG2, while Minsc has not, as he's spent quite a chunk of time petrified up until now. Larian even teased this development on social media leading up to The Game Awards. No sign of Boo yet, though.

The party sets out in 2023
The team at Larian Studios took the reins on Baldur's Gate years ago. Their successes with the Divinity series speak volumes, but in picking up where the BioWare of old left off with Baldur's Gate, the Larian team has been tackling a lot.
So far, in the Early Access versions that we've played over the years, it's felt like Baldur's Gate 3 is in a good place. That's just the starting point, though. We've only seen what chunks of the first Act hold for our party of tadpole-infested adventurers. There's still a lot of RPG to go.
Thankfully, Baldur's Gate 3 is aiming further into the year, past the spring rollout of new releases. Hopefully the August date holds true, and we'll see the entirety of what Larian has in store in the new year.

Prior to the August 2023 1.0 launch, Larian will release Patch 9, which will include various improvements to the Early Access version, including a new playable class. Details of that will be revealed during a special streamed panel on December 14.
Baldur's Gate 3 has been in Early Access since 2020, so this August 2023 release window is a long time coming. Since that Early Access launch, Baldur's Gate 3 has achieved a "very positive" rating on Steam user reviews, with nearly 50,000 reviews logged as of this writing. According to the Steam page, version 1.0 will include all classes and races, and most spells from the Dungeons & Dragons Player's Handbook, plus Acts 2 and 3 of the Baldur's Gate 3 story.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been a full year since ex-BioWare boss Aaryn Flynn and his new studio Inflexion announced Nightingale at The Game Awards. In case you've forgotten, Nightingale is a PvE crafting survival game with a strong Victoriana vibe, but since our chat with them back at Summer Games Fest in June, and an early access delay into the first half of 2023 to accommodate the switch to Unreal Engine 5, we haven't heard too much about the game.


I got to natter with Flynn, director of production Leah Summers, and art director Neil Thompson earlier this week, ahead of the debut of a new trailer for Nightingale at The Game Awards this evening. They filled me in on how the game's blend of fairies and reality-hopping realmwalkers has progressed over the past year - and it turns out that players have had a lot to do with it.

Not only that, but some well-known heroes from the first two games are returning too. Watch the trailer below to see how old hands Jaheira and Minsc are faring these days, and get a peek at the city of Baldur’s Gate.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bandai Namco has released a new trailer for Tekken 8 and it features our first look at gameplay. 
The trailer showcases various Tekken 8 fighters, including series mainstay Jin Kazama. His mother, Jun Kazama, makes an appearance in the trailer as well to tell Jin that together, they'll "cleanse the world of its evil and corruption." 
Check out the Tekken 8 gameplay trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, Tekken 8 is looking great. The trailer above is mostly focused on teasing details about the game's story, which will seemingly feature Jin and the struggles of his family dynamic (thanks, Heihachi). There are also quick clips of Tekken 8 gameplay, although it's void of the UI that showcases each fighter's HP and other elements. 
Tekken 8 was revealed earlier this year during a PlayStation State of Play held in September. That reveal trailer focused on Kazuya and his son, Jin, and you can watch it here. 
Tekken 8 will be released on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC via Steam. It does not yet have a release date.

Another strand game is finally on the way. Kojima Productions officially unveiled Death Stranding 2 at The Game Awards 2022 tonight.
Studio head Hideo Kojima took to the stage tonight to introduce the project, a sequel to 2019's Death Stranding. The trailer featured several familiar faces, including Norman Reedus as Sam Bridges and Léa Seydoux as Fragile.
As for what's happening in the trailer? I couldn't tell you if I tried. But really, that's the appeal of Death Stranding to begin with, and Death Stranding 2 is carrying on the bizarre, vague trailer tradition.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp6fSjMb0MQ
Not many more details have been revealed just yet. As is the case with a Kojima trailer, I'm sure eagle-eyed viewers will pick the video apart for hints and clues about what's going on, and what's transpired in the dystopian American future of Death Stranding leading into Death Stranding 2.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Death Stranding 2 – the sequel to one of the best games of the previous console generation – was announced tonight during The Game Awards. As you might expect from director Hideo Kojima, it was baffling. 
The trailer begins with Fragile, played by Lea Seydoux (No Time to Die, Crimes of the Future), running from some kind of threat while carrying a BB (a baby in an artificial womb; it's a whole thing) in tow. We then get a brief look at Sam Porter Bridges – the protagonist of the first game, played by Norman Reedus (The Walking Dead) – who Fragile tells, "It's time for you to hit the road and start a new journey." Then everything truly goes off the rails. 
Giant mecha vehicles (not too unlike the titular Metal Gears from Kojima's previous series at Konami, Metal Gear Solid). Primary antagonist Higgs dressed like President Amelie Strand and playing an electric guitar. A BB pod full of tentacles. The ominous question, "Should we have connected," casting doubts on the entire objective of the first game – connecting the United States – all quickly flashes onscreen. If it sounds like a lot, it is. Check it out for yourself below:


We're calling it Death Stranding 2, but from the looks of it, the game is actually named DS2. Also, aside from the previously mentioned movie stars, it features Elle Fanning (The Neon Demon) and Shioli Kutsuna (Deadpool 2). 
During a brief interview after the trailer, Kojima revealed he and his company, Kojima Productions, are also working on another video game project and other "visual" works.
No real release information was given, though the game is once again being published by Sony. The trailer also said the footage was captured on a PS5. So, it might be safe to assume Death Stranding 2, like Death Stranding before it, will have some window of exclusivity on Sony platforms. Guerilla Games will also be acting as a support studio, and its proprietary engine, Decima, will once again be used for the game.]]></summary>

Rocksteady has locked in a release date for Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. Alongside seeing the DC anti-hero squad finally debut, we'll also get to hear Kevin Conroy's voice as Batman once again.
Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League will debut on May 26, 2023 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. We got a new trailer for it at tonight's Game Awards 2022, spotlight the squad dealing with what looks like the aftermath of their rumble with The Flash.

As it soon becomes apparent, the Caped Crusader is hot on their heels. And he also seems to have dropped the "not killing anyone" thing, too.
Confirmed during tonight's Game Awards, the late Kevin Conroy will still be the voice of Batman in the coming Rocksteady game. Conroy lent his voice to many iterations of Batman over the years, including voice acting for Rocksteady's Arkham series. And in Suicide Squad, we'll get one more portrayal. The Game Awards trailer closed with a tribute to the actor.

While Geoff Keighly tried to keep as many reveals under wraps as he could, it was inevitable that some titles would sneak their way on the internet beforehand. While Star Wars Jedi: Survivor was officially announced a few months ago, at The Game Awards we got our first look at how the game looks in action and I have to say it looks leaps and bounds better than its predecessor.
Or maybe it doesn't. Fallen Order is still on my backlog. Anyway, Jedi: Survivor brings back Cal Kestis and is set five years after the events of Fallen Order. Hunted by the Empire, he'll have to do what it takes to survive, even if it means making some alliances.

I've been more or less burned out on the whole Star Wars universe for a while now, but following the excellent Andor, I'm ready to get deeply back into a galaxy far, far away. And this looks fantastic and also like a lot of the 9.5/10 games that are building up in my backlog. Star Wars Jedi: Survivor will launch on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC on March 17, 2023, which, following the new Bayonetta game announcement, is my most anticipated game release day of next year.

Conroy made his first appearance as Batman in 1992’s Batman: The Animated Series and has continued to play the character in countless shows, movies, and games. He portrayed Batman in the Arkham games, the series Rocksteady is best known for.


Unlike the Arkham games, Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League is a co-op shooter. Harley Quinn, Captain Boomerang, King Shark, and Deadshot are on a mission to stop the Justice League after supervillain Brainiac corrupts them and forces them to wreak havoc on humanity. While it sounds like a bleak premise, this trailer also gives a good look at the dark humor the Suicide Squad is known for.
Rocksteady also announced that the game would be coming out on May 26, 2023, just a few months from now. This news comes following years of delays and will set it eight years after the studio’s last game, Batman: Arkham Knight.]]></summary>

That info was confirmed in this evening’s trailer at The Game Awards, so we now know with confidence that the game is targeting a launch on March 17.
The trailer was accompanied by a visit from Cal Kestis himself, Cameron Monaghan. The actor is returning to play the beleaguered Jedi in the sequel, and he was around to follow up after the trailer to discuss his enthusiasm for the game. 
For fans eagerly anticipating new details, the trailer offers a lot over which to muse. We see that Cal looks like a more grizzled and powerful Jedi than when we last saw him training to become a knight. That truth is denoted perhaps most po…]]></summary>

With so many games releasing this fall eating up all of my time, I'm sad to admit I haven't had more than an hour or so to dedicate to Bayonetta 3. After all the kerfuffle over the game in the weeks prior to its release, I've been trying to find the time to play it and see just about the ending is pissing so many people off. Turns out, I'll need to play it asap because Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon is coming pretty soon.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5b3_gydc_0
Arguably the most surprising announcement of the first hour of The Game Awards (you know, aside from Al Pacino being there), Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon will take the Umbra Witch back to the very beginning. Sporting a new art style and camera perspective, players will control Cereza and her first demon Cheshire as they fight faeries and solve puzzles while trying to find her mother.
This is not the direction I thought the character would go in next, but given what I'm looking at the in Bayonetta Origins trailer, it definitely seems like something that is right up my alley. Also, there isn't a Bayonetta game I haven't bought yet, so yeah, I'm gonna get it. And dammit, this one needs an art book too.
Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon will release on March 17, 2023, just in time for my 38th birthday.

        <updated>2022-12-09T01:44:37.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Kratos voice actor Christopher Judge has revealed that he initially quit when he learned that someone other than God of War (2018) director Cory Barlog was directing God of War Ragnarök. Longtime Santa Monica Studios lead Eric Williams directed the sequel, which released last month. 
Fortunately for all of us, though, Barlog was able to convince Judge that quitting was not the right call. Judge touched on this during his lengthy speech at The Game Awards 2022 after accepting the award for best performance in a video game.


Here's what he said: 
"I think it's kind of common knowledge that we were honored to go to Tribeca after 2018, and when Cory took me outside and said he wouldn't be directing the next one, I literally did quit. I quit. And he said, 'Nah, I vouch for Eric.' And I said, 'Eric Williams better be a beast.' Eric Williams is a motherf---ing beast."
It's unclear if Judge legitimately quit or if he was just using these words to express his initial disappointment that Barlog was not returning to direct Ragnarök. Nonetheless, Barlog vouched for Williams, and now we have Ragnarök, one of our highest-rated games of 2022 here at Game Informer.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Helping to ramp up an evening of world premieres at The Game Awards this evening, Supergiant Games revealed its newest game. Hot on the heels of the wild success of Hades, Supergiant is doing something it’s never done before: crafting a sequel.
After its previous work on titles like Bastion, Transistor, and Pyre, the studio’s new game takes us back to the roguelike playstyle of the original game, but with a new female lead fighting their way through hordes of enemies.
Instead of Zagreus’ attempted escape from Hades, Hades 2 sees players attempting to descend to fight against the titan named Kronos. The character is dubbed the “Princess of the Underworld” but given the previous game’s nod to Greek mythology, there’s a good bet that this new character has some interesting ties to the big players in that well-known pantheon.
Beyond the intriguing trailer, there’s no word on release date or console platform plans, but we do know to expect new details on Early Access in 2023, and that the game is coming to both Steam and Epic Game Store on PC.]]></summary>

For a long time now, fans of the Bioshock series have been waiting to see what's next from Ken Levine and his team at Ghost Story Games. Their project had been kept under tight wraps with plenty of whispers but nothing concrete until tonight. One of the first trailers in The Game Awards this year was the Judas reveal trailer and, yeah, it looks a lot like a spiritual successor to classic first-person shooter series.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoLJ4HgWqw4
Sadly, it's one of those trailers you have to watch on YouTube. Guess all the blood and guts makes it inappropriate for younger viewers.
Anyway, there is a lot to take in with this trailer, and some of the imagery points to Levine once again diving into some controversial projects in the creation of this world. I'm definitely impressed by what's here so far and can't wait to see more in the weeks and months ahead. Hopefully, it's able to overcome Levine's storied perfectionism that often leads to tumultuous development cycles.
Judas does not have a set release date, but when it does release, it will arrive on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Steam, and the Epic Game Store.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ghost Story Games, the team led by BioShock creator Ken Levine, finally unveiled its first project. It's called Judas, and if you're a BioShock fan, you'll be happy with what you're about to see. 
To say this title follows in BioShock's footsteps would be an understatement. From its industrial sci-fi look to its first-person dual-wielding, superpowered action, Judas sports the familiar trappings of Levine's work at Irrational Games. Ghost Story describes it as a single-player, narrative-driven shooter and provided this tantalizing synopsis:
"You are the mysterious and troubled Judas. Your only hope for survival is to make or break alliances with your worst enemies. Will you work together to fix what you broke – or will you leave it to burn?"


Levine formed Ghost Story games in 2014 after he closed Irrational, only taking on a small group of designers from the former studio. They've been working on its first title ever since, though whether that game has always been Judas remains to be seen. After years of mostly silence, many wondered if we'd see anything come out of the studio; it was reported earlier this year that the team's first project had gone through a rocky patch. Thus, it's nice to see the fruits of their labor finally.
Judas doesn't have a release window, but it's coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.]]></summary>

The final trailer of The Game Awards pre-show was a big one for fighting game fans. After retailer leaks earlier today pointed to a summer release for the highly anticipated fighter, Capcom confirmed it to be true with its latest trailer. Not only does it confirm that release date, but it also gives players their first look at Dee Jay, JP, Manon, and Marisa.

Yep, that still looks wonderful. The big draw for me with Street Fighter 6 has been its single-player mode and I think this trailer gives us the best look at it yet. I love the idea of fighting random on the street, which is looked down on for some reason in the real world.
Anyway, Dee Jay looks great here and I can't wait to see more of Manon, Marisa, and JP.
Street Fighter 6  launches for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC on June 2, 2023. The game is available for preorder now with some custom color outfits up for grabs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At long last, Street Fighter 6 has a release date. Hot on the heels of a second beta test announcement (and retailer leaks earlier this morning), Capcom announced that the next entry arrives on June 2. On top of that, we received a new trailer and details on the Deluxe Edition.
When Street Fighter 6 launches, it will deliver new innovations like real-time commentary, multiple control schemes, and World Tour mode. The base game includes 18 characters ranging from iconic names like Ryu, Ken, Chun-Li, and Blanka to new faces like Luke, Jamie, and Kimberly. For the full list of characters coming to the base game, head here.
The new trailer showed off the World Tour mode, which lets you customize your avatar and travel the world to locations like the US, France, and more. We also got a new look at several previously announced but not-yet-revealed characters, including Dee Jay, Manon, Marisa, and JP.


An earlier leak on Amazon also revealed Street Fighter 6's Deluxe Edition, which includes the base game, the Year 1 Character Pass featuring four characters, colors 3 through 10 of each Year 1 character, and a bonus 4,200 Drive Tickets for in-game purchases.
We recently flew to Osaka, Japan for our most recent cover story and came away impressed with the studio's vision and our extended hands-on time with the game. For more on our trip to Capcom's headquarters, including a fun Rapid-Fire interview and deep dives into the character designs, visit the cover hub by clicking on the banner below. Street Fighter 6 arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PC on June 2, 2023.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Piccolo Studio, the makers of 2019's Arise: A Simple Story, unveiled its next project, After Us, during The Game Awards.
Set on a dead Earth after the extinction of humans and wildlife, players control Gaia, the Spirit of Life, who must recover what’s left by restoring the souls of perished animals while learning how they met their fate. Unfortunately, the ravaged planet is now occupied by dangerous oil-drenched creatures called Devourers that Gaia must contend with as she clears the world of their corruption. After Us places a big emphasis on traversal, as Gaia can glide, jump, and dash across abstract environments, spreading beauty along the way.  


After Us will launch on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC next Spring.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Update, 12/9/2022:
A "brief playable teaser" for Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon is available now within Bayonetta 3. According to Nintendo, "Players who purchased the Old Picture Book at Rodin’s shop, The Gates of Hell, using in-game currency and unlocked it with three keys will be able to access the teaser."
Original Story, 12/8/2022:
Hot on the heels of Bayonetta 3's release in October, tonight during The Game Awards, Platinum Games and Nintendo announced Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon. 
Stepping away from the series' traditional gameplay and visual style, Origins plays out in a cel-shaded art style and an isometric camera angle. It was hard to get too good a grasp on the gameplay from the trailer, though it does look akin to the Viola chapters from Bayonetta 3 – where the player character's combat actions are deemphasized over summons instead. Additionally, it appears that the main summon is Cheshire, who indeed was Viola's only summon in Bayonetta 3. Though time will tell if Origins fairs better. 
Narratively, you play as a young Bayonetta – or Cereza, as is her actual name. You can get a better idea of the overall story and see the game in action in the trailer below:


Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon will be released on Nintendo Switch on March 17, 2023.]]></summary>

You play as Selene Vassos, an astronaut that finds herself stuck in a time loop on an alien planet. It made an appearance at last year's game awards as well, where it was nominated for three awards and won Best Action Game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Upstream Arcade and publisher Good Shepherd Entertainment have revealed Mike Mignola's Hellboy Web of Wyrd, an upcoming roguelite action game with an art style reminiscent of classic Hellboy comics. 
This news was revealed during the pre-show segment of The Game Awards 2022 by way of a fancy trailer showcasing some of the game's methodical but (literally) punchy combat. The game will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC sometime in the future, but a release date was not revealed. 


"Hellboy Web of Wyrd is a roguelite action adventure with an original story created in partnership with Dark Horse Comics and creator Mike Mignola," the game's Steam page reads. "When an agent goes missing, Hellboy investigates. Prepare for monstrous toe-to-toe brawling." 
As you can see in the trailer above, it's clear Upstream Arcade is aiming for Hellboy Web of Wyrd to feature a visual style reminiscent of Mike Mignola's original Hellboy comics. It's easy to see how characters, enemies, and more from those comics could be integrated into the game with such an art style as well.

Unfortunately, we'll have to wait to learn more but Hellboy fans will want to keep Web of Wyrd on their radar (especially given how tragically few Hellboy games out there exist).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dead Cells is getting an official Castlevania DLC crossover sometime early next year, called Dead Cells: Return To Castlevania, as announced today during The Game Awards pre-show. The news was announced via a brief animated trailer. 
The trailer didn't reveal too much about the DLC, nor did it show any looks at gameplay. Though, given Dead Cells is a Castlevania-inspired indie rogue-lite, we likely assume the core formula will remain roughly the same. The game's Steam page offers a bit more info: A gateway to a striking castle has suddenly appeared, and an imposing warrior called Richter asks you to help him vanquish the great evil within. Enticed by the promise of new loot rather than a sense of moral duty, you strike out through the grounds and corridors of the gothic castle to find and kill this mysterious Dracula.


 Additionally, the Steam page boats 51 classic Castlevania songs, 12 newly reimagined tracks, and a brand-new storyline. Gameplay unfolds throughout a fully-explorable Dracula's castle and will feature 14 Castlevania weapons, readapted into Dead Cell's gameplay, three "epic" boss fights, and 20 outfits from "Alucard, Richter Belmont, Simon Belmont, Maria Renard, Trevor Belmont, Sypha Belnades, or even Dracula himself."
No specific release date was given, but Return To Castlevania is expected to be released sometime during "Q1" 2023. It will be available on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and PC.]]></summary>

According to a press release, the Commission, whose purpose is to protect consumers by promoting fair market competition, voted 3-1 to file a lawsuit to prevent the deal's closure. Thus, a federal judge will weigh in and make a decision. Among other reasons, the FTC cites Microsoft’s record of using previous acquisitions to “suppress competition from rival consoles" and points to the publisher's purchase of ZeniMax in 2020 as an example, stating: 
“Microsoft decided to make several of Bethesda's titles including Starfield and Redfall Microsoft exclusives despite assurances it had given to European antitrust authorities that it had no incentive to withhold games from rival c…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There’s still so much we don’t know about the next stealth strategy game from the makers of Desperados 3 and Shadow Tactics: Blades Of The Shogun. Until yesterday, all we had was a codename (“Süßkartoffel”, or Sweet Potato), and a few other scant business facts developer Mimimi Games posted about on their blog last year. In fact, the only concrete thing we really know about it right now is that it’s not going to be Shadow Tactics 2. 
However, in chatting to Mimimi this week about leaving real-time tactics behind in favour of their new "Stealth Strategy" label, I’ve managed to glean a few more details. Alas, Mimimi still aren’t ready to reveal Süßkartoffel’s official name just yet, but head of design Moritz Wagner told me it’s not only going to be much more beginner-friendly than their previous games, but that it will also be much more like one big sandbox this time, resisting the urge to limit players by strict level constraints. To me, it all sounded a bit like they were aiming for something akin to Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain, so I asked him about whether that was an accurate assessment of it. “Yes and no,” he said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The makers of Shadow Tactics: Blades Of The Shogun and Desperados 3 have been thinking a lot about real-time tactics recently. Not just because they’re knee-deep in making their next tactics game at the moment, currently known as Codename Süßkartoffel (the word for "Sweet Potato" in their native German), but because they feel the genre as a whole doesn’t quite convey what’s so special about their catalogue of excellent stealth ‘em ups anymore. It’s a fair cop – despite appearing in our best strategy games list for many years, even I’ve struggled to come up with a succinct way of describing them. Thus, it’s time for a change, say the studio. 
In a blog post published today on Mimimi Games’ website, the studio announced they’re going to be referring to their work as “Stealth Strategy” games going forward, and they’re hoping this new genre label will help prospective players better understand their special blend of silent assassination tactics. This kind of shift isn’t without its challenges, though, so I caught up with the team at Mimimi to talk more about this newfound shift, and how it’s going to lay the foundations for what’s to come in Codename Süßkartoffel.

The colorful adventure game was first revealed at the same event in 2020. It stars a young woman who leaves her isolated village to explore the world for the first time on her bike. Unfortunately, the world is on the brink of suffering a mysterious catastrophe, and the woman collects memories of her experiences before everything falls apart. The bulk of the gameplay, naturally, consists of cycling to different locations and meeting the colorful personalities who inhabit them. You’ll document your adventures by taking photographs and making recordings. 


Season: A Letter to the Future will be available on PlayStation consoles and PC (both Steam and Epic). It's worth noting that pricing differs by platform. The game costs $29.99 on console and $24.99 on PC with an additional 10% launch discount until February 7.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am so beyond delighted to report that Scarlet Hollow, one of my favorite games of the last couple of years, continues to somehow get better and better. Episode 4 is out now and is by far the largest, most elaborate, most choice-filled part so far. And this time out the story gets meaty.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Xenoblade Chronicles 3 is easily one of the best games I've played this year. Alas, I couldn't vote for its rightful spot in the RPS Advent calendar because it's only on Nintendo Switch, and would out me as somehow who quite enjoys the way anime south Londoners replace rude words with "sparking" or "snuffing". Still, I will write about the game here! Sorry supporters.
Anyway, what I want to talk about is Xenoblade 3 – so far, at least – never losing sight of its inner tutorial. I've been hit with new, sometimes dizzying tutorials, tens of hours into the game's story. Rather than being bummed out by this, I'm ecstatic. In fact, I'd argue it's what makes the experience so special.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since release last Friday, The Callisto Protocol devs at Striking Distance Studio have been, I can only imagine, catastrophically hard at work on the PC build. The game was almost unplayable on PC because shader compilation was causing stuttering whenever anything new happened for the first time, which is not ideal in any game, but especially not an atmospheric horror game with jump scares. It's hard to be terrified by something if the game pauses for over a second when it happens.
Anyway, the point is that a patch was released over the weekend, and another yesterday. I'm out of town right now, so I haven't been able to install the second, but I did play test the first one, and whaddaya know? The Callisto Protocol ran smooth for me, using a PC with the recommended specs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Crucial P5 Plus is one of those drives that turn up in these deals articles a lot. That's because it's designed to undercut the likes of the WD SN850, Seagate Firecuda 530 and Samsung 980 Pro, offering slightly slower sequential speeds at a lower price point. That tradeoff is one that I'd make in almost every situation, as you'll definitely notice the extra money in your wallet more than you'll notice a fractional difference in game load times!
The P5 Plus's 1TB model is the one discounted today, with a drop to £90.86 - that's the lowest price we've ever recorded for this model and a good value for a high-end SSD suitable for PC and PS5.

But Mina The Hollower was never meant to be the studio’s next game. It was a side project of Yacht Club Games designer Alec Faulkner - one that no one but him knew existed.
After raising over $1.2M on Kickstarter in February, I wanted to learn more about Alec’s journey from intern to game director, how he pitched his “Gothic Prototype” to the Yacht Club, and ultimately, how the team rallied behind him in hopes of delivering another series as prolific as Shovel Knight. The result is a 36-minute documentary covering the making of Mina The Hollower, which you can watch below.

Final Fantasy VII is experiencing a strange identity shift. The ongoing remake is changing the original canon in bold ways while spin-offs like the 2006 PlayStation 2 game Dirge of Cerberus are being folded in for larger roles in the main story. And then there are new spin-offs, like First Soldier, the online mobile battle royale shutting down early next year, and also plans for another remake called Ever Crisis, a mobile game that will reexamine Final Fantasy VII’s timeline. With all that swirling …]]></summary>

You can now once again scurry around underground death mazes in Rundown 2.0 Infection, the first Rundown shakeup added by developers 10 Chambers after the game's March 2020 release. They plan to re-release all the others, too.
New Rundowns used to entirely replace GTFO's levels every few months, but nowadays each new set is here to stay. How nice of the awful mutant zombie horrors to stick around.

Last month, Naka and former Square Enix employee Taisuke Sazaki were arrested on suspicion of buying shares in developer Aiming after learning in advance about the team’s announcement of its mobile game Dragon Quest Tact (see the full original story below). Japanese outlet Asashi (thanks Video Games Chronicle) now reports that Naka and Sazaki are believed to have tried a similar scheme for the reveal of Final Fantasy VII: The First Soldier.
Ashai notes that in February 2021, developer Ateam and Square Enix announced a partnership to develop the mobile battle royale title. Naka and Sazaki…]]></summary>

Competition regulators from the UK, the EU and the US have been questioning the deal, so in an attempt to reassure them last month Microsoft apparently offered Sony a ten-year commitment to keep selling Call Of Duty on Playstation. Today, Xbox Head Phill Spencer announced that they've made a similar 10-year CoD commitment to Steam and, uh, Nintendo, on which no CoD games currently exist. 
Nintendo have signed, while Valve CEO Gabe Newell says his company won't bother with a legal agreement, in part because they don't believe in "requiring any partner to have an agreement that locks them to shipping games on Steam into the distant future".

Xbox head Phil Spencer has repeatedly promised that the juggernaut franchise will still appear on its main rival’s platforms, but that hasn’t stopped Sony from touting the loss of the series as anti-competitive to stop the deal from going through. After saying he had no problem keeping Call of Duty on Sony hardware for the long term, Spencer has now extended and formalized that promise to Nintendo and Valve. 
Last night, Spencer announced on Twitter that Microsoft has entered a 10-year commitment to bring Call of Duty back to Nintendo. In a follow-up tweet, Spencer states the series will remain on Steam …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[2023 is shaping up to be a great time for wartime RTS games. If Men Of War 2 and Company Of Heroes 3 weren't enough to keep you busy on the WW2 side of global historical conflicts, Petroglyph Games' The Great War: The Western Front will also be stepping into the trenches of WW1 at some point next year as well – literally, in this case, as planning, digging and capturing these muddy lines of defence will play a vital role in both its pre-combat Theatre Commander mode and busy real-time strategy battles. Recently, I got to play through one of its RTS battles, but what I found was a strategy game quite unlike its WW2 rivals. 
In some ways, this shouldn’t be surprising. As Petroglyph Games’ lead designer Chris Becker tells me over email, “WW1 is known for being a war of attrition and a battle of inches,” leading to fewer sweeping power plays when it comes to securing a victory. Indeed, your main concern here isn’t so much the winning of each individual battle, but maintaining your side’s National Will, which Becker says will be "in constant fluctuation" throughout the campaign – and with both the Allies and Central Powers to pick from here, that could mean very different things depending on who you choose. "It’s essential that players continue to monitor this, as the relentless toll that the war will take on National Will can result in overall victory or defeat," says Becker. "Authenticity is at the heart of this, we wanted to truly represent what 'victory' meant in the war - even with success, there is cost."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Publisher Numskull Games and developer Dinosaur Bytes have released a new trailer for its nostalgic platformer, Clive 'N' Wrench, showcasing what to expect in the Christmas World level of the game. 
This trailer arrives alongside news that the 3D platformer inspired by the likes of Spyro the Dragon and Jak & Daxter will get a retail release in the U.S. and Canada as well as a retail release in a "number of international retailers in February 2023 alongside its European launch." The game will be available digitally as well on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC via Steam and GOG. Physical releases will include standard and collector's editions on PlayStation and Switch. 
Check out the new Christmas World showcase trailer below: 


"No 3D platform is complete without an ice world and Clive 'N' Wrench takes that to eclectic levels with Iceratops, the game's very own prehistoric winter wonderland," a press release reads. "Mixing together Christmas cheer and the demise of the Dinosaurs, Clive 'N' Wrench are in for a challenge if they want to collet all the pocket watches and Ancient Stones the world has to offer.
 
Check out screenshots from the game below: 

"Clive 'N' Wrench is a brilliantly crafted 3D platforming paradise full of challenges, collectibles, and charismatic characters," the press release reads. "Starring Clive the rabbit and best friend Wrench, the monkey on his back, players will jump, roll, hover, and spin their way through time and space in a magical 1950s refrigerator on a heroic quest to thwart the tyrannical Dr. Daucus." 
Clive 'N' Wrench will feature 11 levels taking the titular characters through prehistoric winter wonderlands, ancient Egypt, the Wild West, and more. Clive 'N' Wrench will be released on February 24, 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[How the heck do you review Dwarf Fortress? Much like the procedurally generated world spat out at the start of every game, there’s already a huge pile of established lore and history out there from the 16 years it’s been around. It’s like being asked to review Lord of the Rings. It's a vast undertaking, and there aren't any friendly eagles on hand to cut through its dense mythos. Prior to releasing on Steam, I had put a few dozen hours into what is now known as Dwarf Fortress Classic (which is still available for free from Bay 12's website), split over several different periods of time. Thing is, I never really got very far. I’d find a good tutorial, lose a few fortresses to horrible mistakes and then really get established. But then I’d be distracted by the realities of everyday life and by the time I got back to it, I’d forgotten everything and all my resources were hopelessly out of date because of all the wonderful, lovingly detailed updates. Then the cycle would start again. 

The good news is that this new version of Dwarf Fortress released on Steam does an admirable job of making the game considerably more approachable. I was apprehensive at first, but then something clicked and I lost the first of what would be many afternoons over the past fortnight, safe in the knowledge that when I eventually stepped away from this goliath, I’d be able to come back without feeling overwhelmed and have to start all over again. It’s still good ol’ Dwarf Fortress, but this is the most accessible the game has ever been while still being deep, demanding and a legend worthy of being inscribed on a mudstone goblet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ixion starts by asking the question "What if Homeworld was a management sim?". It then proceeds to answer that question in a comprehensive and convincing manner. Bulwark Studios' star hopping epic takes the operatic, elegiac grandeur of Relic's RTS classic, but replaces the space battles with a chewy mixture of stellar logistics.
Also like Homeworld, it's a darned stylish thing. The game commences with a spectacular intro cutscene wherein a futuristic space-shuttle launches from Earth, breaking through the atmosphere to dock with a gigantic, revolving space-station like a chromed hubcap off some petrolhead's pride & joy. The cutscene neatly transitions into the play-perspective, where you see that same shuttle slide into the docking bay from the cold void outside. Welcome to the Tiqqun, Administrator. Your long journey starts here.

Let me tell you now: that is not true. I'd wager the writing and acting will be more believable in the game than in this live action short.

It follows the exploits of Erik and his sister, Mia, well before they met up with The Luminary and follows them on their adventure to find treasure, escape vikings, and jump on top of the heads of monsters in order to reach higher platforms. Unlike Dragon Quest 11, Treasures is an action game with open environments and a focus on collecting valuables.

On June 27, 1972, Atari, as we know it today, was born. Well, technically, it was born a few months earlier under the name Syzygy Engineering, but the name Atari started life in 1972. I know this and many more interesting facts about the company because of Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration, Digital Eclipse's love letter to the gaming giant.
Atari 50 is essentially a playable documentary, walking you through 50 years of Atari's games, home consoles, handhelds, and PCs split into five different timelines. …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey Elden Ring fans, remember those colosseums you haven’t been able to enter since launch? Those doors finally open today, thanks to the arrival of a free PvP update.
Aptly dubbed Colosseum Update 1.08, the previously locked arenas in Limgrave, Caelid, and Leyndell become accessible, hosting competitive one-on-one duels, team battles, and free-for-all fights between players. It’s unclear what you’ll earn for winning other than personal glory, but it’s nice to see the fog finally lift on these mysterious locations. Check out the trailer below. 


This might be the start of a big week for Elden Ring, as it could walk away with the Game of the Year trophy during this week's Game Awards. You can read our review of Elden Ring here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Grab your pickaxe and secure your book of procedurally-generated poetry, because Dwarf Fortress is out on Steam right, flipping, now. Bay 12 Games's hugely ambitious colony sim, which is notionally a game about building a fortress for small, bearded humanoids, but is really an engine for generating elaborate fantasy histories and player-driven stories within them, has been in active development since 2003, with an initial launch in 2006. Since then, it has been continually developed by brothers Tarn and Zach Adams, who have added a truly wild amount of stuff over the last two decades. It's also famously as impenetrable as its title suggests, mainly due to its ASCII visuals and unwieldy, keyboard-exclusive control scheme.

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/12/06/xbox-series-xs-first-party-games-will-cost-70-next-year"/>
        <updated>2022-12-06T14:24:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft has announced that it’s raising the price of first-party Xbox Series X/S games to $70 beginning in 2023. 
IGN first confirmed the news, with a Microsoft spokesperson telling the outlet that "This price reflects the content, scale, and technical complexity of these titles." First-party Xbox Series X/S games such as Starfield, Redfall, and Forza Motorsport will be among the first titles to have the $70 price tag when they arrive next year. The price of Xbox Game Pass appears unaffected, and the Microsoft spokesperson continued by saying, “As with all games developed by our teams at Xbox, they will also be available with Game Pass the same day they launch.” 
Given the increasingly exorbitant cost of triple-A game development, the price rise was only a matter of time. In an October live interview with The Wall Street Journal, Xbox head Phil Spencer said as much when he stated that the company couldn’t keep its products at the same price forever. "I do think at some point we'll have to raise the prices on certain things, but going into this holiday we thought it was important to maintain the prices." 
Sony was the first console maker to charge $70 for its PlayStation 5 first-party offerings at the start of this generation. In August, Sony raised the price of the PS5 itself in multiple international territories, citing inflation as the primary reason; Microsoft immediately responded by saying it had “no plans to raise the price of the Xbox Series X/S consoles.” Of course, that statement was made before Spencer’s comments to the WSJ, and Microsoft declined to comment when IGN asked about the potential of a hardware price raise.
As a reminder, the $70 tag only applies to current-gen titles. PS4 and Xbox One games have and will remain $60, the former standard established during the PS3/Xbox 360 generation.

        <updated>2022-12-05T22:22:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Palworld, AKA “That bizarre Pokémon-ish game with guns”, has a new trailer that puts names to the many cuddly faces that star in this over-the-top adventure.
Meet the Pal, the monsters that roam Palworld’s colorful yet kind of messed up world. These cuddly though often dangerous critters include the seemingly love-obsessed Lovander, grass panda Mossanda, and Tanzee, which is basically Grookey if it possessed a love for the AK-47. Sure, some of them boldly walk the line of being outright copies of existing Pokémon, but these can carry guns, which we imagine is enough of a separation to repel any lawyers. Check out the latest trailer below. 


Palworld first gained attention in June 2021. Developer Pocketpair bills the experience as a multiplayer open-world survival game as opposed to a turn-based RPG like Pokémon. As a human character, you can capture, befriend, train, battle, and breed Pal. If you consider yourself a bigger monster than what you're catching, you even sell, eat, and outright exploit Pal for labor. On top of that, you can build houses, battle poachers, and construct factories to put your critters to work. Palworld looks nuts, and we're still not entirely convinced it's a real video game, but we certainly want it to be. 
Thankfully, Pocketpair plans to release Palworld in Steam Early Access sometime next year, so we'll hopefully get a chance to try it out sooner than later. The game is currently slated for PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's not everyday you see something on Twitter that makes you wonder how many beloved classics from your childhood were made using golf games. Today is one of those days, as it turns out The Lord Of The Rings: The Return of The King was built using the modified engine of an undisclosed Tiger Woods title. 
"Lord Of The Rings is about large areas, then a castle at the end or a fortress - what's like that?", asks Callisto Protocol director Glen Schofield in the video below. "Tiger Woods", he answers. 

Huh.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since its reveal in 2016, Lost Soul Aside has been one of the most promising and mysterious projects on the horizon. Today, the upcoming action game made its first peep since its last showing in 2021, showing off its frenetic combat and stylish flair. 
Lost Soul Aside began life as a solo project by developer Yang Bing. Its 2016 proof-of-concept trailer impressed many with its triple-A caliber presentation and Devil May Cry-inspired action, including Sony, who scooped up the project as a third-party PS4 exclusive. Bing is now working with a full team, Ultizero Games. Sony announced last year that Lost Soul Aside will come to PS5 as well. The adventure stars protagonist Kazar and his shapeshifting dragon companion, who transforms into various weapons for Kazar to wield. 


Despite being officially announced for years, today’s video is billed as an “announcement trailer” presumably reintroducing the game to newcomers while reminding everyone else that it still, in fact, exists. The gameplay looks as polished as it ever has, though sadly, we still have no idea when we’ll get to play it. 
Lost Soul Aside will be available on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4. Be sure also to check out our related series on video games in development hell.]]></summary>

The Pokemon-like MMO's 1.2 update introduces Showdown, a ranked competitive ladder where players are free to twiddle with their line-up using simulated Temtems. 
The update also tweaks how PvP ranking works, adds new PvP battle zones, and a beauty centre where you can tweak your character's appearance. There's a new season of cosmetic doodads, too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Season 2 of Overwatch 2 arrives tomorrow, and it's a bigger deal than it may sound. Overwatch 2 may have marked the beginning of a slightly jarring shift towards the free-to-play model for Blizzard's venerable hero shooter, but it's the release of Season 2 where players will get their first taste of the pace and quality at which future content will be released under the new regime.
I got to spend a few days exploring the new changes that Overwatch 2's second season will bring around this time tomorrow, and I've come away feeling a little torn. On the one hand, the brand new additions - the new Tank, Ramattra, and the new Shambali Monastery map - are gorgeous, intriguing, and enjoyable. On the other, the balance changes to existing heroes really don't seem to have done much to rebalance the most overpowered heroes in the game, which has left me feeling a bit frustrated.

Beyond that the servers will stay online but the devs don't intend to release updates themselves, instead handing responsibility for balance changes over to the community via in-game tools. 
Six years of active development seems like a pretty good run, to be fair.

Following the Fracture live event on December 3rd, the Herald and her chrome army obliterated The Island, sending chunks flying in all directions across space. Then, the island began repairing itself, forming an entirely new world filled with new locations, weapons, and mechanics. Blindly jumping into an all-new map can be a bit overwhelming, so here’s a list of every change introduced in Fortnite Chapter 4.
  



      
												
A New Island
Chapter 4’s most obvious change is the new map. Mainly split between an icy mountain, an autumnal forest, and a series of farmlands, this area has loads of secrets yet to be discovered.

BioWare have now revealed a sneak peek at an early cutscene, in which chirpy dwarf Varric muses about his old companion/possible ancient Elven god Solas. He's the big bad, you see. The Dreadwolf himself.
BioWare have also released a few bits and bobs in celebration of Dragon Age day, including posters for upcoming Netflix show Dragon Age: Absolution, which is out on Friday. I hope it doesn't do a Dota.

Delightfully, its soundtrack is built from loops tied to the animations of people doing things around the world: xylophone plings from little guys tossing coins into a fountain; drum beats from jesters dancing or goblins smashing dead gnomes; barbershop mutterings from pipe-smoking fishermen; long horns from passing ships; organ notes from giant seabirds stretching their necks; and so many more. A bit like Proteus meets Bernband and Alien Caseno with the added ability to make annoying noises by slamming on your lute.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft's proposed buyout of Activision-Blizzard is currently being scrutinized by competition regulators in various countries, but despite previous (and existing) objections the American Federal Trade Commision now looks likely to approve the deal. The news comes from the New York Post, who quote former FTC chairman William Kovacic as saying the deal is 70% likely to proceed. 
There's a web of politics involved, but the short version is that insider sources say Microsoft have won over another member of the four person FTC panel, meaning any vote on whether to launch a lawsuit would result in an even split that would effectively OK the deal. That would reduce current FTC Chair Lina Khan's authority over the body, so to avoid that she might just let Microsoft have at it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Site-blocking is now so commonplace that when yet another country adds itself to the list of participants, barely an eyebrow is raised in opposition. DNS interference is already in place so if that's met with a shrug, why should anyone care about Uruguay's new site-blocking law? Operators of TV services and intermediaries, despite not being copyright holders themselves, can now apply for blocking measures, actionable within four days.

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/12/03/fortnite-chapter-3-finale-event-concludes-with-first-look-at-new-chapter-4-map-and-skins"/>
        <updated>2022-12-03T22:13:09.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fortnite Chapter 3 has officially come to a close. 
Chapter 3 began last December and now, we officially know Chapter 4 begins tomorrow, December 4. Like with previous chapter launches, Chapter 4 brings with it an all-new map to play on that will be filled with new locations and returning favorites. There's a glimpse of this new map at the end of the Chapter 4 "A New Beginning" trailer, which you can watch below: 


Here's another look at the Chapter 4 map: 
Elsewhere in the trailer, you can catch a glimpse of new skins that will likely be in the Season 1 battle pass such as Geralt of Rivia from The Witcher series, the Incredible Hulk, the Doom Slayer from Doom, and even YouTuber Mr. Beast. 
Before all of that, though, players got the chance to experience the Chapter 3 "Fracture" finale event today at 4 p.m. ET (if you missed it, unfortunately you cannot go back to play it as of now). In it, we saw the battle island essentially implode with bits and pieces of it scattered across the stars. 
Players were tasked with collecting zero point fragments scattered about a small section of this map floating in space. The more players collected, the more pieces were added to the playable area. Players could complete quests such as throwing snowballs at enemies or bouncing players off into space as beach balls. You could also complete races, match island props, and more. Everything you did rewarded you with a zero point fragment. After about 30 to 40 minutes of this, the Chapter 4 trailer began. In it, we saw what appeared to be the creation of the Chapter 4 map, with the zero point dragging in pieces from space to create it. 

Fortnite Chapter 4 officially begins tomorrow, December 4, but a start time has not yet been revealed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bell, Rogers, and other copyright holders have obtained a new piracy-blocking order at Canada's Federal Court. The 'dynamic' injunction requires Internet providers to block access to unauthorized IPTV streams during the current NHL season. It's the second order of its kind and, if effective, it won't be the last either.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Multiple beta releases often indicate lots of bugs to be fixed, but in this case we got carried away adding features and thought more testing was needed. New features since beta1 include: Variable interface scaling at whatever size you want (not just 2x and 4x), with optional chunky bevels for that retro feel. Multi-track level crossings to keep road vehicles from stopping in the middle of the crossing. A new Generate World menu which now includes NewGRF, AI, and Game Script configuration menus. Cargo filters for vehicle lists (such as at stations) to allow better visualization of traffic. Optional cargo names above vehicles in vehicle lists, to show at a glance what they carry. The ability to clone or share orders with vehicles grouped by shared orders. An improved local authority action window which now shows you actions you can’t afford, instead of hiding them. In addition, some new tools are available to AI and Game Script authors: Scriptable league tables which can replace the default scoring system AI and Game Scripts can now be modified in Scenario Editor for existing scenarios (although not savegames) (As ever, see the changelog for further details). If you’ve been working on an entry for the title game competition, it’s time to finish and submit it! Download Changelog Bug tracker]]></summary>
