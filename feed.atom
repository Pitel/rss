        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's almost that time again; in October, FFXIV Patch 6.5 launches with a batch of new story beats, dungeons, glamour, and sidequests. As is tradition, Square Enix revealed its Patch 6.5, Growing Light, key art ahead of time as a teaser.
The FFXIV Patch 6.5 art accompanies its special site launch, detailing features headed to the game in early October 2023. Most of the patch features we already learned about during the Live Letter in July, but the key art is new and gives us a little of the tone heading into Growing Light.
It's not like there's a ton of official Zero art out there since she made her debut not long ago, so I'll take it. There's also the precious angel Varshahn, the love-of-my-life Estinien, and Alisaie looking the happiest she's ever been around these people.

Since Lars Sundström, aka lman, joined our team as the iOS porter, we have made significant progress. Thus, you no longer need to compile ScummVM yourself in order to add it to your iOS or iPadOS device. 
If you want to help by testing this version, just follow this Testflight link and enroll yourself in the test program. This may require installing Apple’s Testflight app. You can find instructions on how to install games and how to play them on our documentation portal.
We truly appreciate your feedback. You can share your thoughts with the Testflight feedback feature, where you can attach screenshots and post detailed descriptions. Alternatively, you can use our bugtracker, e-mail us at ios@scummvm.org, or post on our Discord Server. Your help will let us eventually add ScummVM to the App Store.

It’s the experience finally rekindling my love for games as lengthier affairs without feeling like a drag. I can't get enough of the cast, the environments are enchanting, and the dialogue is spot-on. I've played it a little every day since launch with no signs of slowing down.
And looking at the rest of 2023, I don’t see anything dethroning the RPG, not even a messy glitch here or there, but oh god, did I ever break BG3 last night. Something’s definitely gone horribly wrong with my install, or right, as a glass-half-full kind of gal.
You see, I really enjoy modding — check the Scion tattoo — but if a game can be broken, I’m breaking it. And out of my friend group, I seem to have the most bizarre tech problems, leading us dow…]]></summary>

In this foetid offering from Argentinian devs Andrés Borghi and Tobías Rusjan of Saibot Studios, you play a young woman, Julia, who is visiting her film-maker ex-boyfriend to drop off their old apartment key. Julia’s having a hard time getting over the break-up, but she’s clearly doing better than her ex: his apartment is full of broken glass, anomalous red gloop and creepy occult books. 


The game’s twist is that it’s two visual styles thrust into the same frame. On the one hand, you'll explore an 8-bit world of unpleasantly bright colours, finding and combining objects adventure-game-style (I say adventure-game-style, because this is a bit more energetic than most adventure games – you can equip and swing a wrench, and there’s a run button). On the other hand, well. Click the headline to find out, if you dare. Yes, this is me trying to do a jumpscare. Brace yourself!

Ira puts players in the role of a girl named Yeon, who channels an ancient god's powers to battle the forces of Chaos. Korean studio ABShot is behind this one, which mixes anime-style art with bullet hell shooting and roguelike game design. You can see a sample in the PC release date trailer below.

Bringing a bow to a laser fight
If you're a fan of the bullet hell brand of shooters popularized by developers like Toaplan and Cave, you'll be right at home in this colorful maze of lasers. In addition to godly powers, Yeon wields a bow in her quest to locate the scattered remnants of the Ira crystal. Over 150 different bows can be found throughout the game along with various active and passive power-ups. Some might say 150+ bows is overkill, but can you ever really have enough? There are 150 unique relics and 43 bow+relic combo synergies on top of that, and Yeon can summon five Apostles to perform ultimate skills and trigger passive perks. 
As for the roguelike elements, Ira's six stages consist of procedurally generated maps and weapon drops come at random. Early Access feedback seems mostly positive on Steam, where folks have been providing feedback since August 31, 2021. We'll find out how the final version shapes up soon.

While sauntering through the Seattle Convention Center at this year's PAX West, we saw hundreds of developers showing off their biggest, flashiest games to the enthusiastic crowds — many of which had already been announced and were highly anticipated by fans.
However, in a tucked-away corner of the show floor sat an unassuming display featuring a well-loved NES system and a small board signifying its role: demoing a brand new title called Rugrats: Adventures in Gameland.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mortal Kombat co-creator Ed Boon made an unexpected appearance on the popular interview show Hot Ones to talk about Mortal Kombat 1 and the series as a whole. As Boon sweats through increasingly spicy wings, we also get a glimpse at the previously announced Jean-Claude Van Damme skin for Johnny Cage. 
For the unfamiliar, Hot Ones is a 1-on-1 interview show in which celebrity guests are asked questions while devouring wings that get gradually spicier as the interview progresses (usually to humorous results). Boon’s discussion delves into his entry into the game industry, Netherrealm's decision-making process when selecting cross-over fighters, the studio's approach to storytelling, and other topics. Boon is one of, if not the first, video game developer to appear on the show, and watching him share his fighting game knowledge while simultaneously fighting for his life is an entertaining treat. 


During the discussion, we get the first clip of Johnny Cage's Jean-Claude Van Damme character skin, which you can see in the photos below. It will be purchasable in the Kombat pack that will be included in the Premium/Kollector's editions of the game. 

Mortal Kombat 1 launches on September 19 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC. For the latest roster reveals, check out trailers for Nitara, Sindel/General Shao, Ashrah/Havik, and Smoke/Rain.]]></summary>

ClayFighter was initially released in 1993 on SNES before receiving ports on other consoles. It received a 16-bit sequel, ClayFighter 2: Judgement Clay, in 1994 before moving to the N64 with ClayFighter 63 ⅓. The last entry to the series was 1998’s ClayFighter: Sculptor’s Cut, which was largely just a fixed/expanded version of the previous title. I say this as a fan, but the series was never very good.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sometimes, My Nintendo rewards can drop without warning. Although Super Mario Wonder is tenuously linked to this new "Mario shopping bag" reward, it doesn't really have anything to do with Wonder specifically and could have arrived at any point in time. Still, it exists, and you can snag it!
[gallery link="file" size="large" ids="402718,402722,402723"]
It'll cost you though. This bag is 800 Platinum Points, which is a decent chunk of fake money. That said, it is in line with prior bags, including the Animal Crossing Dodo Airlines reward from 2020. The dimensions for this Mario bag are 18" x 14" x 3.2 ", and here's the rundown from Nintendo:
"This colorful bag features a selection of Super Mario characters on one side and the classic Super Mario series logo on the other. You can also fold it into an iconic 'Question Mark Box' pocket that makes it compact and easy to throw in your bag and take Mario and friends wherever you go!"

To this reward's credit, it does fold into a Question Mark box, so it has that going for it.
Need Platinum Points?
As a reminder, if you want physical rewards, you can find our full Platinum Point guide here, which has been updated with details on weekly missions: bookmark it for when you need quick points for a reward. A handful of points is incredibly easy to get, as that’s basically just 15 minutes with Super Mario Run, or a quick sign-on to the 3DS or Wii U 3Shop. Also remember that any shipments are bundled together, so you can pay a flat rate for multiple items instead of paying it each time. Just know that items go out of stock on My Nintendo frequently, and some are never restocked

A new trailer revealed the game’s new presentation and an October release date.
Gargoyles Remastered takes the 1995 game and repaints it with a coat of new enhanced visuals more faithful to the series (and you can instantly toggle between the new look and the classic 16-bit graphics). It also includes the usual bells and whistles for remastered Disney games, such as an instant rewind, wide-screen presentation, and achievements. The original soundtrack has also been remastered. Check out the game's first trailer below.

On social media, various Starfield players are popping up with examples of using the physics of Starfield to steal some good loot out from under guards and NPCs. Usually, when you pick up an item in Starfield that you're not supposed to (noted by the red icon in the corner of its pop-up description), guards will be alerted. And, in my experience, they respond pretty quickly and violently.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I guess Disney isn’t done spelunking through their 16-bit catalog since it just announced the 1995’s Gargoyles Sega Genesis platformer is getting a full remaster. It’s coming to Switch, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on October 19, 2023.
Do you remember Gargoyles? I caught the odd episode as a youngun and really enjoyed it, but I was more into watching Warner Bros cartoons. I thought about watching it when I was older, but everyone says the show takes a sudden and abrupt dive in quality at some point. I’m not sure why that bothers me, plenty of shows are good until they’re bad, but that doesn’t mean they’re not worthwhile.
https://youtu.be/OYUJXoWh1yg?feature=shared
The Gargoyles game debuted in 1995 exclusively for the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive. It was fine. Some would define it as a game that doesn’t suck. I put it more in the camp of 1995’s Toy Story. It’s a licensed game, so you should set your expectations there, and you might be pleasantly surprised.
Unlike Disney’s previous 16-bit re-releases, Gargoyles Remastered is getting a full art style update and soundtrack upgrade. It looks pretty good, but it’s obviously built over the old game and does some awkward things with perspective and animation. However, if you don’t like it, you can simply toggle it back to 16-bit mode.
It’s, uh, a bit of a weird choice for a remaster, but I welcome revisiting any, so bring it on.
Gargoyles Remastered is coming to Switch, PS4, Xbox One, and PC. It is scheduled to be released on October 19, 2023, for $14.99 USD. There will also be a physical version available via Limited Run Games.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last month, Nintendo revealed longtime Mario voice actor Charles Martinet will no longer voice the character. The company stopped short of revealing who is taking over the role, although it did say we’d find out in the upcoming release of Super Mario Bros. Wonder, which does not feature Martinet as Mario. 
Now, Nintendo has released a new video featuring Martinet and Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto discussing their history together, the role of Mario, and Martinet’s new role, Mario Ambassador. 
You can watch the video in full below, but we’ve transcribed most of it for your reading as well:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[E3 2023 was canceled back in March, and PAX organizer ReedPop was in charge of organizing the event, the first of a multi-year contract. However, E3's overseer the ESA has announced this partnership will not continue.
According to GameIndustry.biz, the ESA and ReedPop have come to a mutual decision to part ways. On top of that, E3 2024, which is still planned to take place, will not be held at its traditional venue, the Los Angeles Convention Center. This had been previously reported by the city itself. There’s no word on where E3 will be held, but the site reports that the ESA is also looking to completely reinvent the show in 2025. 
“We appreciate ReedPop’s partnership over the past 14 months and support their ongoing efforts to bring industry and fans together through their various events,” said ESA president and CEO Stanley Pierre-Louis in a statement to GameIndustry.biz. “While the reach of E3 remains unmatched in our industry, we are continuing to explore how we can evolve it to best serve the video game industry and are evaluating every aspect of the event, from format to location. We are committed to our role as a convenor for the industry and look forward to sharing news about E3 in the coming months.”
ReedPop had been tasked with revamping this year’s ill-fated E3 after the show had collapsed over the last few years due to the pandemic and waning interest from publishers/developers. The 2023 edition fell through after Nintendo, Sony, and Microsoft declined to attend alongside publishers such as Ubisoft and Sega. The last in-person E3 was in 2019, and outside of the online-only 2021 event, every subsequent E3 has been completely canceled. Geoff Keighley's Summer Game Fest has filled the void since then.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since its reveal earlier this year, Mortal Kombat 1 has been unveiling its star-studded cast, one big name after another. Between J.K. Simmons reprising the role of Omni-Man from Invincible to John Cena being confirmed as Peacemaker, the roster is looking to be fierce in terms of both fighters and their actors. Warner Bros. Games revealed one more member of the cast in September: Megan Fox, of Transformers (2007) and Jennifer’s Body (2009) fame will be playing the role of Nitara in Mortal Kombat 1. 
For those who haven’t touched a Mortal Kombat game since Deadly Alliance, Nitara is a winged vampire who hails from a realm called Vaeternus. It’d appear she’s up to the same old antics, as the Nitara trailer showcases the vampiress fighting against Ashrah, Kung Lao, and more. “I grew up playing Mortal Kombat and I can’t believe that I’m voicing a character in the new game,” said Fox. “It’s an honor to be a part of one of the greatest video game legacies of all time.“
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ah8VyRhiWiE
Again, Deadly Alliance was the last time fans of the series have been able to play as the winged vampire until now; though she was mentioned or referenced in Mortal Kombat: Deception, Mortal Kombat X and Mortal Kombat 11. Nitara was also present in the 2021 Mortal Kombat film, where she was played by Mel Jarnson.
Mortal Kombat 1 releases on September 19 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC.

Either way, I’ve recently developed an intense appreciation for teeny, tiny microgames, to the point where I’ve essentially been begging in the RPS Slack channel for recommendations. Just one more Steam link and I’ll be fine, promise.
And I don’t mean short games in the seven- or eight-hour sense. Not even film-length games like Portal or Jazzpunk. No, I seek to gorge on the slightest sub-hour canapés, games in which you can see and do everything in one or hour or less. "Irresponsibly large"? Another time, Mister Starfield, I crave something irrevocably small.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With the premiere of Castlevania: Nocturne quickly approaching, Netflix has released a new trailer for the animated series. In the trailer, we get a glimpse of the characters, setting, and a piece of the story coming in the new series. Following the success of the original Castelvania animated series that ended in 2021, Castlevania: Nocturne continues the gory franchise with an all-new series that focuses on the origin story of Richter Belmont.
The trailer is a wild, bloody ride as you could imagine for Castlevania. It's also got a banger remix Nocturne Version of the song Divine Bloodlines.

Live Digital World Premiere a day early
Even though the official release date is September 28, you can check out Castlevania: Nocturne a little early. According to Netflix, fans can tune in to Netflix on Twitch on September 27 at 12 p.m. ET and watch a live stream of Castlevania: Nocturne a full day early.
I've yet to watch the final season of Castlevania but this reminds me I need to do so ASAP. Hopefully Castlevania: Nocturne is as good as the original series, which sort of led to a bunch of quality animated series on Netflix.
Although you should definitely check out the original Castlevania, it's not necessary to watch Castlevania: Nocturne. In fact, Netflix claims "If you’ve never seen a Castlevania show, gaming adaptation, or anime before: start here."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It sounds like a new successor to the Switch could be approaching. New reports out of Gamescom 2023 say Nintendo showed off Switch 2 tech demos to developers behind closed doors.
Eurogamer reports these presentations took place to show off the technical specs of a potential Switch successor, or "Switch 2" as we'll call it. In its own reporting of the news, VGC corroborates with its sources.
Per Eurogamer, the developer presentations were shown tech demos. One included a souped-up The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. VGC's source also claims Nintendo showcased Epic's The Matrix Awakens tech demo for Unreal Engine 5, reportedly utilizing Nvidia DLSS upscaling.
Nintendo has not formally announced any plan for a new Switch successor. Nintendo of America president Doug Bowser recently spoke to IGN, saying he's "stopped counting years" when it comes to the Switch's ongoing life cycle. And Nintendo did not comment on Eurogamer's report.
Even with the radio silence, though, Switch 2 rumors are brewing. A previous report pointed towards a launch in the second half of 2024. Eurogamer says this lines up with what it previously heard, though Nintendo may be keen to launch sooner.
With tech demos apparently going around, we may actually be getting close to a new Switch.

The long road here
Of course, there's still some gas in the tank for the modern Nintendo Switch. The handheld hybrid is just over six years old at this point, but it's still got some games hitting this holiday season. Namely, there's the Super Mario RPG remake, a new WarioWare, and the Style Savvy crew's next game, Fashion Dreamer. Plus, a ton of Pokémon DLC is in the works too.
Add that onto a year where the Switch got both Tears of the Kingdom and Pikmin 4, and it's not a bad swan song if a Switch 2 is cresting over the horizon. We'll have to see what Nintendo's got in store.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Maybe... less game?
We all know that The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is the gift that keeps on giving — even without additional content. But with how many juicy new skills and items, and with what Breath of the Wild's DLC delivered, yes, we are indeed still hungry for more.
But in a recent interview with Famitsu, Zelda series producer Eiji Aonuma seemed to suggest that there were "no plans" to release more content for Tears of the Kingdom, saying "we've done everything we can to create fun in that world."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Space will neither save nor free us. Like Starfield, it will not be glamorous or exciting. As billionaire jebends plot to establish their own corporate fiefdoms amongst the stars, our descendents' potential spacelives are looking as miserable as collecting 5 spacewolf livers. But I find some hope in spaceship salvage sim Hardspace: Shipbreaker, both in the overt plot about unionisation and in the small satisfaction of doing a job well. Head down, shut up, and focus on dismantling this spaceship carefully and efficiently. It's an attitude that won't save the world but can get you through one more day, and sometimes that's enough.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I finished Part 1 of my perverse effort to play Starfield entirely as a space sim, I was both terrified and tantalised. A quick reminder of the rules: I can only acquire new ships by commandeering them, with no planetary landings permitted, which also means that I can't just shuffle between ships at whim after adding them to my hangar. It's possible the game contains an orbital shipyard of some kind - if you've found one, don't spoil! - but at the time of writing, any vessel I abandon is essentially gone for good. 


My first trophy as greenhorn orbital bandit Mary Read was a UC Transpo, which isn't so much a spaceship as a shoebox with toilet roll tubes and detergent bottles glued to the outside, its ordnance limited to a single laser. I began my second leg confidently expecting to spend many hours in this Fisher Price starmobile, vainly searching for a wounded battlecruiser or an abandoned solar yacht or some other, more capable vessel accessible to a space pirate of extremely modest means. This is going to be Jalopy: Galactic Edition, I said to myself. Imagine my shock (and slight disappointment) when I jumped to the very next planet and proceeded to comprehensively ding over a Crimson Fleet Spectre.

The EA Sports UFC franchise made its debut in 2014, the first MMA game released by the company following its non-UFC-licensed title, 2010's EA Sports MMA. While the first licensed UFC title was somewhat disappointing due to the underwhelming feature set and the series trying to find its footing as an all-new franchise, it was a solid first attempt.

I sound like I hate it, but don't. James actually likes it. Nate has not played it but he asks us about it.
As you might imagine, the field of stars also makes up the bulk of our What We've Been Playing this week, although Nate is considering whether to start that or Baldur's Gate 3 - we give conflicting answers... Plus, some interesting recommendations, and Garfield.

PAX organiser ReedPop is parting ways with the Entertainment Software Association and will no longer be the production company behind future E3 events (thanks, gamesindustry.biz).
While plans for E3 2024 have not been cancelled for the time being, the ESA has informed the Los Angeles Convention Centre — the host venue of prior E3s — that the show will not take place there. This does not necessarily mean that the 2024 event will follow the same path as its 2023 and '22 predecessors, but a location change will certainly be in order.

With help from creator Shigeru Miyamoto, the longtime voice of Mario took a moment to introduce his new role and gush about how much he loves all the people who have supported him as Mario over the years.
The video starts with a hearty, "It's a-me, Charles!," as Martinet effortlessly leaps into the iconic voices of multiple characters. It's a bittersweet reminder that we'll no longer hear him as Mario, Luigi, Wario, and Waluigi. While he won't be doing those voices in games, his new role will allow him to continue meeting with fans. Martinet calls this a "great, great honor" and says he's looking forward to seeing folks at events around the world.

In truth, I was surprised (and somewhat saddened) by some of the comments we received around our Baldur's Gate 3 coverage. If you missed them, they were mostly in the vein of saying our increased volume of BG3-related posts felt like "spam", harking back to when we (and the internet at large) all went similarly bananas over Elden Ring last year. I know it can sometimes seem like writing about these games - particularly on RPS - feels like we're somehow neglecting everything else going on in PC gaming. But the truth is a little more complicated than that, so I wanted to take some time to talk a bit about this in this month's Letter From The Editor, because there are a number of reasons why this happens - and will probably continue to happen more generally as websites fight for survival.

In the case of Affogato, it’s three of my favourite types of games mashed together: it’s Coffee Talk by way of Persona by way of any card-based tower defence game – only here it’s sort of "reverse tower defence", as the game's Steam page is keen to point out. It's your own card units that are the ones moving along pre-defined tracks wreaking havoc on stationary enemies, not the other way around. Maybe tower assault would be a better term, but that's by the by. Served with a dollop of anime froth on the top, Affogato should be my exact cuppa joe. But despite its intriguing ingredients, I wouldn't say it's been wholly successful in slooshing them all together.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Despite its simple mechanics and SNES-like aesthetics (or perhaps because of them), Stardew Valley is one of the most beloved indie games to come out in recent years. As such, fans have been keen on whether developer Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone can follow this with the upcoming game, Haunted Chocolatier.
Not much is known about their next project, but Barone recently posted an image from the new title. It doesn't show much, but it's a kind of tease, and it's giving people Stardew Valley vibes.
https://twitter.com/ConcernedApe/status/1699121826948079851
Featuring the visual style of ConcernedApe's magnum opus, the screenshot shows an unnamed, wizened man who says they were "just having the most terrible dream." Under this image on Twitter, some have commented that it reminds them of Grandpa from Stardew Valley. One person theorized that the new game is set in the same universe and Grandpa has gifted a chocolate shop instead of a farm.
He's not dead, he's just sleeping
We don't know a great deal about Haunted Chocolatier, other than you'll be running a confectionary place. It's also going for that Harvest Moon-inspired look, which worked out well for Stardew.
Alongside the new project, Barone is also working on update 1.6 for Stardew Valley, so it's clearly going to be a busy time for them. We may not hear about the new game for a while longer.
However, that doesn't stop people from asking when the new update for Stardew is likely to drop. The developer says they "don't want any pressure," so we'll all have to be a little patient before we hear further details about Haunted Chocolatier.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Is there anybody out there who didn't think Starfield would be an immense hit the yoctosecond it released? It became Steam's top game before it even officially launched. Now it's been declared that Bethesda's anticipated sci-fi RPG has surpassed one million concurrent players.
That's according to a recent Twitter post from Head of Xbox, Phil Spencer. According to the exec, this number was "exceeded" today, just one day after Starfield's full release. It should be noted that this is across all platforms. And by "all platforms," he means the two that the game is available on.
https://twitter.com/XboxP3/status/1699621881421471889
It shouldn't be a surprise to anyone that it's doing incredibly well, especially so soon after it launched. In fact, if you look at the data on SteamDB, you can see that over 170,000 people are currently playing on PC at the time of writing. Of course, these numbers are changing all the time and could easily spike once we hit the weekend.
Sucks to be any other game releasing this month
After more than a decade of being in the pipeline (from Todd Howard's initial pitch to the final release), the hype seems to be worth it. Starfield is receiving great reviews pretty much across the board.
It's got its faults, of course. It's a Bethesda game after all, but one that seems less buggy than things like Skyrim or Fallout 76. In the end, one million concurrent players across Steam and Xbox is a mighty milestone, even for the big guns of the gaming world.
Right. That's the Starfield stuff done. When's The Elder Scrolls 6 coming out, Todd?

Detective Pikachu exists in an exceptionally rare space in the video game industry. A subseries to the wildly popular Pokémon franchise that started as a video game in 2018' 3DS title, the name Detective Pikachu is more synonymous with its 2019 live-action theatrical film starring Justice Smith and Ryan Reynolds. But just before the release of that film, The Pokémon Company announced a follow-up to the 3DS game, and with the impending release finally upon us four years later, I got my hands on the long-awaited sequel.

While there is still no official word on the whereabouts of the 'Switch 2', sources for both Eurogamer and VGC have reported that demos for Nintendo's next console were shown at this year's Gamescom.
The reports state that the Switch successor was shown to selected developers behind closed doors during the event, supposedly with the former console's launch title, Breath of the Wild, running on the follow-up's more powerful specs. Both outlets stress, however, that there is no suggestion that the title will be re-released.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Punching up.
Nintendo’s Punch-Out!! was one of the most iconic arcade and console fixtures of the early '80s, migrating from coin-op to the NES, where it was remoulded as Mike Tyson’s Punch-Out!! and bestowed a Rocky-esque narrative around up-and-coming challenger Little Mac. Since Super Punch Out!! and the Wii’s original entry, however, it’s a series that, in stark contrast to its emphasis on fast footwork, has slouched for modern movement. And, with Nintendo reluctant to step back into the ring, Argentina’s Purple Tree Studio is now fixing to become the new victor of an undernourished franchise.
Thunder Ray’s musculature is cut and framed entirely around the Punch-Out!! formula, to the point that anyone claiming Nintendo’s cease-and-desist manoeuvres are overly aggressive might want to reconsider their stance; they're still a far cry from toppling Capcom from the shutdown podium. There is little in the way of modern bonuses or extra modes here, just three difficulty settings to work through that save your progress and allow you to go back and revisit previously felled challengers. This works well if you’re struggling on a higher difficulty, allowing you to drop back to Rookie settings, for example, to learn the patterns more effectively.

Where to find Ship Technicians in Starfield
You can usually find a Ship Services Technician at the major settlements on almost any planet. Even those run by specific corporations or factions will try to be as independent as possible, so they will offer their own services. They will allow you to buy, modify, and sell ships, as well as change your home ship.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Oft' am I struck by the fact that video game homes belonging to characters in the depths of despair are nicer that all of the homes I've lived in myself. Granted, I'm a thirty-something in a country with a years-long housing crisis, so even the Baker House in Resident Evil 7 is of "I think I could just about afford that one day" status. But it comes to something when a 70s depresso-capsule at the bottom of the sea has more square footage and storage space than I do.
Under The Waves (which got patched today, and not before time because I've had one fatal error crash per play session since it came out last week so far) is about a deep sea diver called Stan, who is living and working at the bottom of a big wet metaphor for grief. You will know this because a) its Steam page says this up front, and b) it's not super subtle (this game is published by Quantic Dream). But, as newsman Edwin pointed out to me today, when was the last time the sea wasn't a metaphor for grief? It's never a metaphor for enjoying a nice raspberry ripple ice cream. And despite Stan making reference to "what [he's] been through" half an hour in, I think it does a great job with its chthonic sadness. You float about in your tiny little sub in a great misty darkness, listen to the extremely melancholy music, and you start thinking about sad stuff in your own life. But you get into Stan's capsule living area and you think "this guy has a carpet and a book nook, what the hell?"

The videogame in question is Pyrolith's V.A. Proxy, which I've had my eye on for a while, on account of it being inspired by Nier: Automata and Devil May Cry, with a landscape of megastructures and bruised and rusty art direction that calls to mind The Signal from Tölva. In this moody open world action game, you play one of three robots who awaken to find their memories gone, and promptly set out in search of their creator. It'd be an eye-catcher even without the atomic parry, which you can witness for yourself in the embedded clip below.

Are they just collections of sealed-off maps that fake the presence of landmarks such as named cities beyond their invisible boundaries? I just don't even know any more, but Starfield mod creators are looking into it. One intrepid soul, Draspian, has tinkered with the code to disable said invisible boundaries, and in the process, revealed that planetary maps do, in fact, join together, though as you might be expecting, Starfield doesn't take kindly to being treated this way.

Recently released gameplay footage from IGN gives us a glimpse into what we can expect from the upcoming game. We see a bit more of Bright Falls from the perspective of FBI agent Saga Anderson who is investigating the strange events occurring in the sleepy town.

As Remedy has warned us, the game ditches much of the dated gameplay from Alan Wake, and it fits perfectly in the modern survival horror landscape. A scene featuring Anderson shooting it out with enemies on a merry-go-round with destructible teacups…]]></summary>

Nintendo has mentioned on a number of occasions in recent years how it wants to go beyond video games and the company's American president Doug Bowser has now reiterated this during an interview with the Washington Post.
Bowser mentioned how Nintendo is currently "evolving into being an entertainment company with gaming as a nucleus of the overall business model". While Nintendo has dabbled in other areas such as love hotels and playing cards throughout its history, its recent push in other areas like theme parks and the movie industry have been significant game changers. It's also teamed up with toy icons like LEGO and released multiple mobile games.

After an advertisement featuring the actor and former wrestler Dave Bautista, Mortal Kombat 1 has now officially revealed the vampire of the Outworld Nitara will be played by the actress Megan Fox.
Although Fox's involvement seems to be the focus in the latest trailer, this does still count as another playable fighter reveal. Nitara made her playable debut in Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance. As highlighted in the new trailer, she's being voiced by Fox, with the character's likeness also seemingly based on Fox.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Meta-horror visual novel Slay the Princess is locking in a date, just in time for the spookiest season. Black Tabby Games will unleash Slay the Princess on October 20, 2023 for PC, Mac, and Linux via Steam.
Black Tabby Games has already made itself known in the horror space through Scarlet Hollow, and Slay the Princess looks to be pretty terrifying in its own way. The general idea is that you wake up in some woods, driven by the disembodied voice of the Narrator (Jonathan Sims from The Magnus Archives) to slay the princess. Doing so, he says, will save the world.
But what do you choose to do when you reach her cabin? Do you pick up the knife and bring it down? Do you try to talk things out with the princess, voiced by Nichole Goodnight, or simply do what you're told? And what if you've been here before?
Without saying too much, the narrative starts to twist and shift in ways you can already see in the newest release date trailer:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY07Vh7MEbg
More than a princess
The draw of Slay the Princess, as we've seen in demos here, is how its narrative threads weave and intersect to reflect decisions. Slay the Princess is, essentially, about trust. And depending on what you've already done, the princess may warp to reflect your actions, as you also try to comprehend just what is going on in this place.
Some really sharp writing and incredible art work, complemented by the fully voice-acted lineup, really makes Slay the Princess shine. Its focus on creating an exact vibe and idea earned it a spot on our list of favorite games from PAX East 2023.
Suffice to say, I'm looking forward to this one, and October is the perfect month for it. Black Tabby also confirms Slay the Princess is coming to Steam Deck, so the terror can go on-the-go, too. Make your choices and live with them as Slay the Princess arrives on October 20.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mortal Kombat 1’s roster already has a few returning names from the series’ 3D era in the forms of Ashrah and Havik, and another long-lost favorite joins the fight. Nitara is making her long-awaited return, and it’s such a big homecoming that NetherRealm has enlisted actress Megan Fox to voice her.
Nitara is a vampire that made her debut in 2002’s Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance. She’s only been playable in a couple of entries, had a small cameo in Mortal Kombat 11, and appeared in the 2021 Mortal Kombat film. Despite having only a few appearances to her name, she’s endured as favorite among fans who grew up with the 2000s era, and she looks as deadly as ever in MK 1. 
Megan Fox brings Nitara to life, and you can get a sample of her performance in the trailer below. “I grew up playing Mortal Kombat and I can’t believe that I’m voicing a character in the new game," Fox says in a press release. "It’s an honor to be a part of one of the greatest video game legacies of all time.” Given that Ronda Rousey voiced Sonya Blade in MK 11, it’s not surprising to see NetherRealm rope in another celebrity to perform one of its kombatants. 


Mortal Kombat 1 launches on September 19 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC. Check out our latest hands-on impressions of its Invasions and Story Mode here. Be sure to also watch the game's most recent trailer from Gamescom 2023.]]></summary>

We're still thinking about it nearly four months after the game came out, and now is the time when we unleash all of those feelings — good and bad — unto the world.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Atari has announced that the Sneakybox-developed tactical RPG, Days of Doom, now has a release date of September 21, 2023. That’s soon! The news was revealed as part of Feardemic’s Fear Fest 2023.
Okay, are you sitting down? It’s a roguelite. But, hey, I think it looks pretty good. I typically won’t tell you about the games that don’t show any promise at all. I’m protecting you. I’m a hero.
Anyway, Days of Doom has you leading a group of apocalypse survivors to “Sanctuary,” the aptly named happy place amongst all the death and decay. Rather than just being a zombie pandemic, it looks like the Earth is being torn apart by Hell itself, so beyond just zombies, you fight all manner of ghouls. There’s a supernatural element to everything, so one of the recruitable party members is a hydromancer and can manipulate water.
https://youtu.be/eMLRyW1PA-E?feature=shared
Days of Doom features a permanent progression system, where you build up the abilities and capacity of your party to continually make your next run more likely to succeed. You know, just like a roguelite. It puts focus on figuring out how each of the 8 types of heroes function and how it they can be used in strategies together.
For the past few years, Sneakybox has largely been working on Atari’s Recharged series of remakes, the most recent one being Quantum: Recharged. While those are interesting, I’m looking forward to seeing them get back to different genres and see how the skills they’ve built up get applied.
Days of Doom is coming to PC, Nintendo Switch, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and even Atari VCS it releases on September 21, 2023.

You could say...it's been a while. Time management seminars aside, that's exactly why I admire the raw tenacity of Bloodstained director Shutaro Iida and producer Koji "IGA" Igarashi (and their team); who have been working on a single release for this long in an era of fleeting live service games. And it's still being worked on, as two new modes are on the way.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It seems as if Discord is taking one more step to solidify its platform as “for the gamers,” thanks to Xbox’s September update, which allows players to stream their favorite games to their friends on Discord.  In order to stream from your Xbox to Discord, you’ll need to ensure that your accounts are linked. If they are, then you can not only stream via Discord, but you can join voice channels directly from your console. 
In addition, the most recent update brings with it the inclusion of Variable Refresh Rate (VRR), a feature that can give players “a smooth, artifact-free experience” while they play their favorite titles, according to the official blog post detailing the September update. It’s also easier to use the rewards you’ve accumulated. If you’re looking for your rewards post-update, press the Xbox button on your controller, select Profile & System, navigate to your profile, and select My Rewards.
The update also brings with it the ability to request a spot in a friend’s party, the option to report voice incidents that might be offensive to some, a new way to receive wishlist notifications, a new way to pair your controller to your console without having to get up, and an update to the Xbox app on PC. 
How to use Discord on Xbox
Here's how to use Discord on your Xbox console:
Press the Xbox button via your controller.
Navigate to Parties & Chats. You should see a Discord option, select it. 
You're good to go and will be able to view voice channels as part of the UI.

We were promised a "big year" for Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night back in December 2022. And it's been a bit of a wait, but, developer ArtPlay has released a new blog update on Kickstarter along with a video to tease the future of the Metroidvania.
First up, the Castlevania-inspired action platformer — which was created by former Castlevania producer Koji Igarashi — has sold over 2 million copies worldwide since it launched in 2019. An impressive figure for a game that could potentially never have been made.

There are a few exceptions to that sweeping statement, though, and I count both Final Fantasy XIV and Baldur's Gate 3 as my current ride-or-dies. And as I'm lost venturing further into the weeds of Faerun, I'm still keeping up with my FFXIV dailies. So what happens when we combine both?
It's a recipe for FFXIV Baldur's Gate 3 mods. To my delight—and maybe dismay—Larian's ambitious RPG charmed others like me, rolling two of my favorites into one. It's not the biggest scene in the realm of fancy fan-made tweaks, but you're damn right "FFXIV" was the first thing I furiously typed into Nexus Mods' BG3 directory.

But the latter was the highlight of my experience. 
I completed three contracts during my hands-on time, each at different levels of progression for protagonist Basim Ibn Is’haq.

Additionally, the picture teasing Belle and Beast in the game shows The Nightmare Before Christmas items can be unlocked. The infamous rose will also take part in the proceedings.
Belle will be joining the other princesses in the game like Anna, Ariel, Elsa, and Moana. There is no gameplay or quest information regarding the French prince and princess as of writing.
The rose from the film was also referenced in a prior tweet from Disney Dreamlight Valley earlier this week.

Disney Dreamlight Valley is getting spookier
Halloween is just around the corner, and Tangled villain Mother Gothel is seen posing in front of some landmarks from the stop-motion animated film The Nightmare Before Christmas. There's no Jack or Sally yet, but you can see the Spiral Hill from the film's conclusion and during the "Jack's Lament" scene in the teaser image for Belle and Beast's arrival.
It also has the fountain from the opening song of the movie, in addition to the graveyard entrance gate. Kingdom Hearts fans should feel well acquainted with these fixtures, to say the least.
As you'd expect with these inclusions, the Star Path for September is going to be Halloween-themed. These items displayed in the above picture will likely be included.

        <updated>2023-09-06T18:42:06.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Day of the Devs has announced that they’ll be highlighting indie games in Day of the Devs: Game Awards Edition. This will put smaller developers in the spotlight on December 6th in a livestream as part of the weeklong Game Awards celebration.
Ugh, I hate to be reminded of the Game Awards. Part of my distaste for them is because they make such a token effort to recognize smaller developers who make contributions to the industry. The difference between a AAA game and everything else isn’t quality; it’s budget. The Game Awards feels like an extension of the corporate side of gaming, where indies are seen more as a crucible for ideas that might be profitable on a larger level.
Day of the Devs, on the other hand, is a bit easier to appreciate. It’s helmed by Double Fine and iam8bit, who at least have an appreciation for the artistry in gaming. The Day of the Devs: Game Awards Edition also allows anyone to submit their games for consideration (before September 20th) without a financial barrier for entry.
The form doesn’t really define what they consider “indie,” which is a bit concerning since people apply the label pretty widely these days. Dave the Diver, for example, is often described as indie production. But the developer, Mintrocket, is a division of Nexon Korea Corporation, which has a net income in the billions.
So, here’s hoping that Day of the Devs: Game Awards Edition recognizes some hot indie games that actually need it. As a note, the usual Day of the Devs show that normally takes place in San Francisco in November is being pushed back a few months to early 2024.
Day of the Devs: Game Awards Edition will livestream on December 6th, 2023. The Game Awards proper follows after on December 7, 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In an interview with Famitsu, Nintendo Producer Eiji Aonuma, and Director Hidemaro Fujibayashi confirmed that The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom will not be receiving any new content or DLC. Genki_JPN on Twitter translated the interview:
"We have no plans to release additional content this time, but that is because we feel like we have done all we can do to create play in that world," Aonuma told Famitsu. "This time, the reason we decided to make a sequel to the previous game in the first place was because we thought it would be worth experiencing new ways to play in Hyrule. If such reasons arise then we may return to the same world. Whether it is a sequel or new work, I think it will be a completely new way to play, so I hope you will look forward to it. We are very grateful that so many customers have been playing Tears of the Kingdom for so long and deeply, so we will to do our best to make the next title even more enjoyable."

Honestly, it's no surprise that Nintendo feels Tears of the Kingdom is essentially finished. After all, our very own Chris Carter gave the sequel a 10/10 when it was released on May 12, 2023. In comparison, Breath of the Wild only received one expansion pass that included three DLC packs. While the DLC packs were good, they weren't quite on par with BotW itself.
Zelda fans have reason to rejoice, though. Based on the interview, it seems like Nintendo is opting to jump right into the next Zelda title. Maybe going this route we won't have to wait five years for the next one! With the Switch successor reportedly planned for 2024, the time may be better spent working wit the new dev kits.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Activision announced it's adding popular Spyro the Dragon villain Ripto to Crash Team Rumble's Season 2 line-up. New maps and modes will coincide with the character's entry into the game. There's no word of Spyro making the roster as of yet. However, the purple dragon's 25th anniversary looms later this month.
Ripto will be the first Spyro the Dragon character to join the multiplayer game Crash Team Rumble. On September 12, Season 2 of the competitive multiplayer game will include a new mode called Party Mode (which has mini-games) and additional maps such as Waste Deep. The map is inspired by the level Cortex Castle from Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time. A Halloween event is likely to occur as well as there's candy with a Jack-o-Lantern's face on it (via CanadianGuyEh) in the official Season 2 picture.
[caption id="attachment_402353" align="alignnone" width="1200"] Image via the Crash Bandicoot Twitter[/caption]
Many expected the protagonist, Spyro the Dragon, to be first in line for the party game. He has appeared in Crash Team Racing: Nitro-Fueled as a playable character in the past. There's no confirmation of Spyro's introduction to Crash Team Rumble yet, but it seems to be only a matter of time in fans' eyes. Regardless, it's exciting for many to have Ripto in Crash Team Rumble. 
Ripto is the main villain from 1999's Spyro 2: Ripto's Rage. He's a dinosaur who craves power and will take it by any means. He also utilizes magic as part of his arsenal, like fire and poisonous attacks.
Spyro the Dragon recently hit a big sales milestone as his 25th anniversary draws near. The Spyro Reignited Trilogy, which has the original trio of games remade, has sold over 10 million copies since 2018. At the time of writing, you can buy the game for 75% off on Steam. The offer ends on September 11.

And, alas, it’s just a bit much for the Steam Deck to handle unless you’re happy to sacrifice visual fidelity, framerate or - in most cases - both if you plan on spending your time doing anything except browsing menus (though there’ll be plenty of that).

It's the company's first new IP in almost 30 years (a claim that contains in it an inherent threat for Starfield 2), and though Bethesda has copied some of their own homework for some themes and factions, Starfield is indeed a spacefaring adventure of epic scale and sometimes surprising beauty. It's this scale that makes Starfield feel unfortunately small and empty, a place that still has those fun little Bethesda side quests that escalate into something huge and absurd, but that can also swallow them whole in its cold, star-scattered grandeur.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the grim darkness of the far future, the galaxy is your oyster. Or at least it will be, once you've played 100 hours of Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader, an RPG from Pathfinder developer Owlcat in which you can buy planets, configure your genocidal Dark Eldar friend to strike ten times a turn, and gaze on ruefully as a demon explodes out of your Psyker's head. 


An immediate and shameful disclaimer: I can't match Nic Reuben's deep knowledge of the 40K tabletop universe, which saw him ruminating upon the mysteries of the Koronus Expanse back in 2022, while holding Owlcat's feet to the fire over the absence of space dwarves. The nearest I got to playing 40K as a lad was its Battlefleet Gothic spin-off (which none of my friends were interested in, so when I say "playing", I mean that I sat in a room staring glumly at some unpainted Lunar-class Cruisers while other kids went out and climbed trees). The framing I'm working with instead, based on an hour of hands-off Rogue Trader gameplay, is that it's sort of Warhammer Mass Effect, but with XCOM-style turn- and grid-based combat, and while there are opportunities to be a compassionate hero, you fundamentally only have the option of playing Renegade. Let's dig in!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The animated film Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem has garnered critical acclaim since its release in theaters last month. As fans know, the best way to follow up a good TMNT project is to make a video game out of it, and that’s exactly what's happening next year. 
Publisher Outright Games, along with Paramount and Nickelodeon, have announced a new untitled TMNT game in development set within the Mutant Mayhem universe. It will feature the same striking visual design and follows a new story set months after the movie's events. There’s no word yet on if the film’s ensemble cast will reprise their roles.
In terms of gameplay, a press release only hints that the project involves “combining energetic ninja teamwork gameplay with a humorous narrative, players will take control of the Turtles as they interact with a host of memorable characters from the franchise and fight to save this stylized take on New York City from a new mutant threat.” Outright Games has experience working on games based on kid-friendly licenses, making titles based on Star Trek: Prodigy, How to Train Your Dragon, Paw Patrol, and Peppa Pig. 
The TMNT: Mutant Mayhem game is targeting PC and consoles. It’s the latest project in what’s been quite a renaissance for the Turtles, especially in video games. The resurgence kicked off with last year’s well-received TMNT: Shredder’s Revenge, which recently got a big new expansion. The Cowabunga Collection bundled nearly every classic TMNT game into one package for a modern audience. A single-player action game based on the beloved TMNT: The Last Ronin graphic novel is also in the works.]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-09-06T14:04:25.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Publisher Tilting Point has revealed Cypher 007, a new top-down action game starring James Bond, coming to Apple Arcade on iOS devices later this month. It launches on September 29 and takes players into "The Mind Trap." 
Because it's an Apple Arcade game, it will require a subscription. But after subscribing, the game is technically free-to-play and will feature zero microtransactions, like all Apple Arcade games. In it, you'll be able to unlock new gadgets and weapons, build resources, collect outfits and new character models from across the franchise, and more. 
Check out the Cypher 007 teaser trailer for yourself below: 


"The criminal mastermind Blofeld and head of Spectre has once again hatched a plan to sabotage his archenemy James Bond," the game's description reads. "This time, he has utilized brainwashing techniques known as 'The Mind Trap,' holding Bond captive in a mental prison in an attempt to turn him into the ultimate double agent. Play as Agent 007 on his most challenging missions yet – escape the Mind Trap, defeat Blofeld, and put an end to the Cypher program." 
Because it's a 007 game, you'll run into other MI6 operatives like Q, M, and Moneypenny, all while completing levels that increase in difficulty as you progress. You can compete against other players, too. 

Cypher 007 hits Apple Arcade later this month on September 29.]]></summary>

I compare this project, which seemed pretty much doomed at the time, with the globe-straddling free-to-play battle royale/concert venue/art gallery/Olympic sport/all-swallowing multiverse Fortnite has become, and I feel extremely old. My sense of time's crushing burden is not alleviated for learning that Epic are staffing up for work on "a new experience in the Fortnite ecosystem", which sounds a lot like a Fortnite open worlder.

Despite that success, though, it seems the company is moving on from this Hyrule as Zelda producer Eiji Aonuma has revealed there will be no DLC for the game. 
That’s what he told Japanese magazine Famitsu in a new interview, as translated by Genki_JPN on Twitter. Based on his comments, the team behind TOTK might be moving on to a new Zelda game in a new Hyrule, too. 


“We have no plans to release additional content this time, but that is because we feel like we have done all we can do to create play in that world,” Aonuma told Famitsu, according to Genki. “This …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lightyear Frontier is not the kind of game that fits neatly into a 30-minute Gamescom demo. There's so much to see and do in this laidback farming mech sim that by the time my demo ends, I barely feel like I've scratched the surface of it (and that's even with the assistance of some handy secret dev cheats to show me some of the structures and features they've got planned later on in the game). Rather, this is a game that's designed to unfurl slowly, bit by bit, over the course of several hours, and before we begin, developer Frame Break's CEO Joakim Hedström tells me they've shortened the game's opening sequence for this particular demo, just so they can get players right into the thick of things as quickly as possible. 
But even on this whistlestop tour, there's plenty to dig into and delight in here - not least its gloriously bright and inviting colour palette (take that, Todd). I got to sample its farming, its wonderfully weighty mech exploration, and even indulge in a little bit of, well, powerwashing. Yep, PowerWash Simulator's influence was well and truly felt at this year's Gamescom, and I'm so very here for it.

And if you were planning to get it through PC Game Pass, that's another issue, as Game Pass games are locked down behind the fully Deck-incompatible Universal Windows Platform system. If the wonder of space depends on the it being a borderless infinity realm of endless possibilities, nobody told Microsoft.
There is a way, however, to sidestep both problems. Xbox Cloud Gaming will let you play Starfield on the Steam Deck at a steady (enough) 30fps, by streaming the game from Microsoft's cloud network direct to your screen - no Proton GE or Lutris launcher required. It still takes some setting up, but luckily, you’ve already clicked onto a step-by-step guide on how to do it.

Do you yearn for the older, simpler days before the great Unrealification and the invention of sex scenes, when people called a spike pit a spike pit, and you could count all the different colours in a screenshot on your fingers?

It's always fun talking about the high-end server platforms, but at the opposite end AMD and their platform partners have been rolling out an equally interesting assortment of AMD Ryzen 7000 series based server products. With the Ryzen 9 7950X/7950X3D providing up to 16-cores / 32-threads, a growing number of Ryzen server motherboards supporting DDR5 ECC UDIMM, and a number of innovative Ryzen server platforms coming to market, it's an interesting time to be after a budget-friendly server platform or other robust rackmount systems where looking for power efficient 16 cores or less configurations.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ring the bell, everybody, it's time for another round of game developers telling players that they don't really understand what a "game engine" is. The spark this time is little-known science fiction adventure Starfield, which I believe we've reported on before. The game has a few obvious foibles - in my experience as a space pirate, NPCs sometimes struggle to navigate their surroundings, and then there are those stark disconnects between planetary surfaces and orbital space. Hiccups such as these have led a few players to wonder whether the game might work better using different technology, and in particular, the newer versions of Epic's ubiquitous Unreal Engine. Isn't Bethesda's proprietary Creation Engine, which the company have been updating since 2011, getting a little long in the tooth?
You'll find a lot of the discussion below this post from Digital Foundry boffin John Linneman on Twxter, which has attracted both gloating PlayStation fans (remember, Starfield is Xbox-only in console land) and a number of thoughtful replies from some fairly senior game developers. This conversation goes back a fair way, of course - people have been ragging on Bethesda for using "the same engine" for years. And there's a definite air of world-weariness to some of the developer responses.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The upcoming reimagining of Alone in the Dark is skipping Halloween this year. Instead of inviting players back to Derceto on October 25, the survival horror adventure will now arrive on January 16.
In a press release, developer Pieces Interactive offers a candid explanation for the move: it doesn’t want the game to compete with October’s heavy hitters like Marvel's Spider-Man 2 and another big horror game, Alan Wake 2. 
“Our intention is to avoid competing with the wake of Alan's epic release and to evade the dazzling skyline of cities adorned by the graceful swings of Spider-Man," Pieces writes. "We aim to truly remain as Alone in the Dark as possible. To honor this, the spine-chilling horror game has been rescheduled to unveil its horrors on January 16th, 2024. This extension will serve a dual purpose: not only will it permit us to meticulously perfect the gaming experience, but it will also grant us the opportunity to fully immerse ourselves in the remarkable releases of October.”
The studio also released a new trailer starring David Harbour’s Edward Carnby, one of the game’s protagonists, showing off his performance and impressive facial capture. 


Alone in the Dark is a modernized revamp of the 1992 survival horror classic that stars actors Jodie Comer and David Harbour as protagonists Emily Hartwood and detective Edward Carnby, respectively. Players control one character to explore the haunted Derceto hospital to solve a sinister mystery, with both scenarios offering different story threads and moments. You can read our full preview of the game here. It will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo has revealed three new Switch bundles releasing next month. One is a Mario Kart 8 Deluxe bundle that includes a standard Switch model and the other two are special Animal Crossing: New Horizons-themed Switch Lite consoles that include the game. All three bundles will be released on October 6. 
The Mario Kart 8 Deluxe bundle includes a standard Switch console, a digital version of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, and a three-month individual membership for Nintendo Switch Online. You can check it out in the image below: 
As for the Animal Crossing: New Horizons Switch Lite consoles, there’s Isabelle’s Aloha Edition, which is a pink Switch Lite with Animal Crossing leaves on the back of the console, and Tommy’s Aloha Edition, which is a teal Switch Lite with the same leaf details on the back of the handheld console. Both bundles will cost $199.99 and include a digital copy of Animal Crossing: New Horizons. The Isabelle edition is exclusive to Target and the Tommy edition is exclusive to Walmart. 
You can check out both bundles in the gallery below: 

These three bundles come just days after Nintendo announced a new Mario Red Switch OLED console, which will cost $349.99 and releases on October 6 as well. Nintendo revealed this console during its Nintendo Direct for Super Mario Bros. Wonder, which we went hands-on with to preview. 
While waiting for these new bundles, read Game Informer’s Mario Kart 8 Deluxe review and then read Game Informer’s Animal Crossing: New Horizons review.

From the Stray Demons of Dark Souls through Bloodborne's Cleric Beast to the dragons of Elden Ring, you must learn not to be awed by creatures who look they could kill you with a sneeze. You must learn to run towards that titanic knight with the enormous shield, rolling between its colossal ankles, using its stature against it. You must learn to see past the visual overkill of a swing that would surely fell a skyscraper, registering only the effects on your poise and health bar. It's a learning curve, for sure, and that makes the modding of mechs from Armored Core 6: Fires Of Rubicon into Elden Ring a little more than the usual act of mischievous fanservice.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You may have seen that Alice Bee has started a "land on every planet" run of Bethesda's Starfield. By total coincidence - I promise you it's accidental, I was so pleased - I've been working on a "land on no planets" run of Starfield. The reasoning for this is as follows: people say that outer space is the worst part of the game, because it's just an irritating interval between the maps where the majority of quests, loot, intrigues, etc are found. It's a fast travel loading screen you can fly about in. But what if you double-down on the space stuff? 


What if you never descend from orbit, not even to repair, modify or upgrade your ship and offload inventory? What if, rather than buying new ships or building them, you progress exclusively by boarding other captains and making off with ship and cargo? How well does Starfield scrub up as a thoroughbred space sim that leans towards bloodthirsty piracy? Here to answer these questions is Mary Read, my custom character and budding astral freebooter. She's named for her distant ancestor, the legendary 18th century English buccaneer Mary Read. She's had a crack at life on shore, setting foot most recently on Earth's Moon, but from this point on, her fate and fortune lies amid the stars. Arrr!

This is important because ScummVM currently supports only the Macintosh versions of these games. These versions were produced by Tetraedge and are built on a completely different engine than the original Windows versions; basically, they are reimplementations, not ports. Now, thanks to the folks from ZOOM-Platform, you can easily obtain these game variants.

In the 22 years since Shenmue’s debut, I’ve played the game 23 times. Twenty-three times I’ve lived the life of protagonist Ryo Hazuki, watched his father die, and navigated his world and experiences. Each time I’ve realized something new about the game, the people who made it, or something new about myself.
Playthrough 23 was the most poignant of them all. I saw, noticed, and felt things I hadn’t in any other, and it’s given me a new appreciation for Yu Suzuki and Sega’s AM2 development team.
More than anything else, Shenmue is a video game about how a real person in a real world inhabited by other real people experiences the death of a loved one and the loneliness that follows.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Early in my interview with Alx Preston, founder and creative director at Heart Machine, he corrects me on an important detail about Hyper Light Breaker. I’d spent the first few minutes referring to it as a sequel, but he clarifies, "It’s not Hyper Light Drifter 2. It’s a follow-up, meaning that it’s an installment in the franchise of Hyper Light. So it’s a different game, different protagonists, different gameplay." After getting the chance to learn more about the game and see it in action, this distinction makes a lot of sense. For me to call it a sequel was misleading, given how different the games look and play.
Breaker is a 3D rogue-lite with a strong emphasis on multiplayer. Players explore an area called the Overgrowth, collect weapons and gear, and fight off monsters. And though the…]]></summary>

Retro love letters are a dime a dozen these days. From titles that veer too close to the source material to games that take the kernel of an earlier game's original concept and expand it into previously unforeseen realms, nostalgic experiences are everywhere in the games industry. Yacht Club Games emerged as an early leader of this trend with its smash hit Shovel Knight, which took the 2D action-platformer genre and gave it several fun twists despite keeping the core gameplay and visual styles faithful to the 8-bit graphics with which many of us grew up. Similarly, Yacht Club's next game, Mina the Hollower, looks like a …]]></summary>

Void Stranger is the work of Finnish indie System Erasure, whose vertically scrolling shmup/mystery game ZeroRanger was one of Dominic Tarason's (RPS in peace) best games of 2018. The new title is a sokoban-style puzzle game, which is to say, it's broadly about shoving crates around, but as the name suggests, Void Stranger has bigger ambitions than helping you while away five minutes over lunch. It's a game of faith, amnesia and devilry, which reportedly portions out its secrets across multiple playthroughs. Here's a trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[People have talked about Baldur's Gate 3 going a bit wonk in the final chapter when you reach the titular big city. It was actually my favourite act of the whole game - not that I doubt other people saw things going on the wonk a lot, but I did, thankfully, escape more or less unscathed (apart from one instance where, for some reason, Gale the smug sex wizard had a conversation with me, and then immediately repeated the exact same conversation). For me, the final act of BG3 is the act when all my nonsensing in the rest of the game paid off. The part where it turned out it did matter that I spent a painstaking hour separating and killing a bunch of guards in a mine, so I could save the gnomes trapped in a cave-in. It was also where a genie turned me into cheese.
Spoilers, obvs, if you're that way inclined.

While Sayer the Space Scoundrel is having trouble getting around as they engage with the main story, I have started another character to engage in some nonsense (to the extent that there is any in Starfield) - the first of such I've detailed here.
I've said it before, but you're my very best friend, so we're going to play Starfield together. Join me as we step, wobbly and uncertain like Bambi on ice, into Bethesda's huge and partially procedurally generated space RPG universe for the adventures of Turbo Eclipse (I used an astronaut name generator intended for a child's party), a spacefaring nerd who longs only for the thrill of science. Yes, we're going to visit every planet in Starfield. Or at least as many as possible before I lose every single one of my marbles. And hey, planets look kinda like marbles! Strap in, spacefarers. Let's put this proc gen through its paces.

That's right, this month's RPS Game Club pick is the alternate-reality detective adventure Hypnospace Outlaw!


Released in 2018 and developed by Tendershoot, Hypnospace Outlaw takes place in a warped version of 1999 where accessing the internet is done via a headband you wear while you sleep. You play as an enforcer - a moderator of sorts - tasked with keeping the users of Hypnospace in check by reporting any violations you discover on their personal web pages.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As someone with a general aversion to online competitive modes in games, I'm always grateful when someone, for once, especially in this age of endlessly bland multiplayer experiments, thinks of the solitary solo player. I'm especially grateful when us single player preferers get a knowing nod of acknowledgement in fighting games, too, which are so naturally geared toward pitting your skills against other human beings that anything involving playing against the AI is often either an afterthought or so threadbare that you can't help but feel like you're missing the point. 
But that's still, for my sins, how I like to consume fighting games when I occasionally play them - which isn't often, I'll admit, for exactly the reasons described above - and so when I sat down for my Mortal Kombat 1 demo session at Gamescom this year, I was pleased to see not just a very slick story mode in attendance, but also a new single player challenge mode called Invasions that publishers Warner Bros described as "a giant interactive board game" that "lent into action RPG" territory. Its numerous node-based missions looked substantial based on what I played, and the idea of applying a seasonal service model to it, endlessly rotating in new locations and missions every so often - a whole different Invasion, so to speak - is actually something I'd be very much behind. It, that is, I was a) good at Mortal Kombat, and b) the missions I played during my demo weren't quite so… err… boring.

And there is a remake on the way – of which we’ve only seen concept art. But by most measures, the franchise has been dormant for a decade.
Nonetheless, Fisher was once the lead of a game momentous enough to compete for sales with Halo, have Hideo Kojima’s Metal Gear Solid team taking notes, and find itself referenced as the graphical and technical benchmark of the early Xbox years.

The adventure game's strong premise of a writer magically entering books to steal treasures wore thin across uninteresting puzzles, repetitive crafting, bland combat, and—worst of all for a game about the wonder of words—iffy writing. But once the credits rolled, I realised I had been fooled by its polished looks, and its core development was team was tiny (with a squad of external contributors), leaving me feeling a lot more forgiving. So, it's a good game to check out on Game Pass, or at least flick through the opening chapters.

It’s the work of seasoned modder PureDark, previously seen hammering both DLSS and FSR into Skyrim. I’ve tried the Starfield mod and it works rather nicely, granting a visible quality boost on RTX graphics cards while equalling FSR’s ability to smooth out Starfield’s sometimes-tricky performance. Unfortunately (and largely by association), it’s also been dragged into a spot of nasty business, one involving a separate mod for DLSS 3 frame generation and PureDark’s application of DRM.

Especially when I get to the characters saying ‘I love you’ to each other…” Gaider mimes the sickliness of the scene and his own horrified response. “Apparently I did it so well on Baldur’s Gate II that James Ohlen kept handing me this stuff. And, god, I hated it so much.”
It’s weird, in fact, that Gaider wound up working on Baldur’s Gate II at all - let alone that he became synonymous with Dragon Age and romanceable companions afterwards. At 27 years old, he ran a hotel in Edmonton, Alberta - the same city where, unbeknownst to him, Bioware was busy making its name. Once it came time to make a sequel to Baldur’s Gate, Bioware cast around for local writers, and a friend recommended Gaider, who had played D&D in the ‘80s before it fell out of fashion.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Baldur's Gate 3 is a relentlessly horny videogame, Alice B wrote back in August, and that certainly describes the shock I felt when noted Githyanki grouch Lae'zel abruptly informed me that she was down to clown, a whole three hours in. "Ms Lae'zel, I happen to be a graduate of BioWare Sex University," I told her sternly, adjusting my robe. "If I'm going to have a torrid liaison in an RPG it'll be 60 hours from now, just before the final battle, and let's face it, I'm more likely to get scared of alienating party members and end up friendzoning everybody."
Lae'zel proved persuasive, however - "I like the way you stink," was how I think she phrased it - and one risque fade-to-black later, we were triumphantly entwined in post-coital bliss. Well, at the risk of empirically demonstrating that romance is dead, it turns out all that might have been down to a technical problem. According to Larian CEO Sven Vincke, Baldur's Gate 3 characters were accidentally encoded to have very low standards at launch. Haha, I certainly can't relate!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the bigger Discourse torpedoes aimed at Starfield's glittering hull over the past month has been its strict division between planetary surfaces and outer space. Space sim fanatics were dismayed to learn that you can't actually fly down to the surface of the planets you're orbiting - instead, you hit a button to initiate a loading break and a landing cutscene, which makes outer space feel more like a glorified airlock chamber than, well, outer space. This segmented approach has prompted many unflattering comparisons with No Man's Sky, in which you can manually pilot through the atmosphere. 


Players and critics were similarly disappointed by the apparent inability to manually fly between planets in different orbits - instead, the game invites you to pick a destination from your star map or while using your spaceship's scanner HUD, with the journey condensed to a cutscene, again. Well, I bring news on this front. You can actually fly "to" and perhaps even "between" planets in Starfield. But there are some buts. Buts of astronomical dimensions. Onward!

"We are aware that many of you have been asking for a PC version", producer Naoki Yoshida said in a statement on the platform formerly known as Twitter. "So allow me to take this opportunity to officially announce that development on a PC version is currently underway." There's no Final Fantasy 16 PC release date as yet. Yoshida hopes to be able to share more - together with some insights on the first wodge of Final Fantasy 16 DLC - "before the end of the year".

I’ve started to get some answers to the world’s intriguing questions and now that I see the end in sight, I’m not sure I’m ready to roll credits (although, like any Bethesda Game Studios RPG, the game continues after credits with faction questlines, side missions, and more). I could have last night, but my wife and I decided to watch a movie instead: Mission Impossible 4: Ghost Protocol (one of the best in the series). I’ve seen it but she hadn’t, so I picked up my Backbone controller device for my iPhone 14 Pro Max and booted up Starfield to continue playing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Newcomer studio Sonka has released a new gameplay trailer for its horror game, Holstin. This new trailer reveals a fun twist on the game’s shooting mechanics and comes alongside word that there’s a demo now available on Steam. 
The trailer is short, running less than a minute, but it showcases the game’s terrifying ambiance, throwback visual style, and zombie-like creatures that have seemingly infested the small 1990s Polish town Holstin is set in. It also highlights that parts of the game are playable as an isometric, third-person shooter like last year’s Signalis and as an over-the-shoulder third-person shooter like in Capcom’s recent Resident Evil remakes. 
Check out the Holstin gameplay reveal trailer for yourself below: 


“A psychological survival horror game set in an eerie, isolated 90’s Polish town consumed by an ominous presence,” the Holstin Steam page reads. “You’ve come looking for answers, but everyone seems possessed by something foul. Explore the festering town, interrogate locals, and fight ungodly manifestations to get to the truth.” 
There’s no release date in sight for Holstin, but you can try the game for yourself today through a demo available on Steam right now. 
Holstin is set to release one day on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC.

Around the turn of the millenium, 1GB sticks were commonplace, and by doubling that amount over time we've gradually worked our way up to 8GB, 16GB and 32GB sticks of DDR4 and DDR5 being common sizes. Now though, DDR5 manufacturers are also producing an intermediate 24GB size, allowing for 48GB kits of two sticks each.
This new capacity requires a BIOS update for most motherboards, but pricing on it can be quite good - and that's what we're seeing today, with extremely rapid DDR5-6400 CL36 RAM available in a 48GB capacity for $130 after a $18 price drop.

Verne Colon The Shape Of Fantasy is, at least in part, an adventure game, and weaker for it. Taken as 'pure' interactive fiction, it'd be shorter and simpler, but might allow its premise, atmosphere, and intriguing world to shine the way they ought to.


The premise actually takes some explaining. Jules Verne himself takes the place of Aronnax, the protagonist of Twenty Thousand Leagues Under The Seas, and instead of mere hermitry, his new submarine home/prison is devoted to a guerrilla war against The Nation, a Prussian-ish empire you might be able to stop using a techno-magical gubbins that allows you to edit reality. Intriguing, right?

A new trailer provides a new look at Gunbrella’s explosive, retro-inspired action. Players control a woodsman seeking revenge for the death of his wife, with players using their weaponized umbrella to blast apart foes or as a platforming tool. For example, you can use the umbrella to glide, swing, or slide around levels, among other uses.


We went hands-on with Gunbrella’s Steam demo and walked away impressed. You can watch us give it a spin in this episode of New Gameplay Today.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this week I attended a hands-off preview for Owlcat's forthcoming CRPG Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader, which is shaping up nicely, inasmuch as there's anything "nice" about a Warhammer 40,000 game. Rogue Trader is a party-based affair in which you play a sort of Warhammer East India Company, tasked with flipping outlying worlds to the Imperium. In order to carry out this goal, you're granted a lot more individual license than most human residents of the 40K universe. You can, for instance, recruit ungodly xenos to your grimdark troupe, operate a private armada, and even colonise planets and turn them into your own personal piggybank. Just watch you don't push the whole "heresy" thing too far.


I'll have more for you on the subject soonish, but here's an interesting advance snippet from my interview with Owlcat's creative director Alexander Mishulin, in which we discussed what really distinguishes a CRPG from other kinds of role-playing game. According to Mishulin, it's all about designing for choices with consequences that genuinely run the entire length of the game, without (somehow) getting lost in the narrative undergrowth.

You slap on some masks, choose your loadout, then get to robbing banks or stealing things from crates. Often, it ends in absolute chaos as you mow through waves of coppers and rush to a getaway van. The number three might not signal a sweeping change to the formula, then, but that's arguably a good thing. It's a better-looking version of its predecessors that doesn't lose sight of the co-op silliness.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Leftfield Collection is always one of my favourite areas to visit at EGX. Partly because it's regularly stuffed full of interesting indie games with often very neat and unusual controllers attached to them (which in previous years have included actual paper shredders and full-on Morse code machines), but also because they're often so new and hot off the digital presses that I've never even heard of them before, which is very, very exciting to me. It's a great little space to discover what will be the next talking points of video games-to-be, and this year's line-up looks to be no exception. Here are all the games you'll be able to play at this year's Leftfield Collection at EGX 2023.

Fans of the series have been asking for it for years now, especially since all the other mainline Borderlands games are playable on the console. Developer Gearbox Software is finally delivering and it's doing so on October 6. 
It's not just Borderlands 3 that's coming to Switch. Gearbox says it is specifically the Ultimate Edition of the game, which features all six content add-ons and a collection of bonus cosmetic packs. 
Here's what you get in the Ultimate Edition of Borderlands 3:

I felt it was so close, too close, to Bloodborne in everything from the cadence of the Chalamet puppet's jog, to the "duhhnng" noise of pickups, and the gothic sheen of its streets. At the time I thought it was a bit of a duff pretender, honestly.
But a good chunk of time with it at this year's Gamescom has swivelled my head back in its direction. Having clacked through some dingy streets, fired blue gloop from my arm, and fought the literal King Of Puppets, I've come to realise it has the potential to be a magnificent Soulslike in its own right.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A quick heads-up for those of you hopping aboard the Starfield interstellar express today: there is a non-zero possibility that one of the game's elevators has a shark in it. That's according to Bethesda's head of publishing Pete Hines, who encountered the displaced piscine trouble-maker while playing the game before release. He's "almost positive" the shark isn't there any more - and just like that, my understanding of Starfield has been transformed. This isn't a 150 hour RPG treadmill of resource extraction, artefact investigation and base-building, wherein you give spaceship tours and put +5% on your accuracy, or what-have-you. It's an extremely slowburn horror game, with every innocent elevator potentially housing a Great White jumpscare. All of which, Hines feels, is true to how Bethesda "embraces chaos" in their games, though he does feel the company's popular association with jank and bugs isn't "particularly fair".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After the Steam Deck and the Asus ROG Ally, it’s Lenovo’s turn to have a go at handheld gaming PCs with the newly-announced, Windows 11-powered Legion Go. It’s a chunky lad compared to its peers, weighing 854g and packing an 8.8in display, but promises a bigger battery and – most interestingly – a pair of Nintendo Switch-style detachable controllers.


These are partly intended to simply give your wrists a rest, setting the Legion Go down on its (also Switch-esque) integrated kickstand while you play with the loose controllers. The right pad, mind, also includes an optical sensor on the bottom, so you can swish it around a desk like a vertical mouse. Potentially a difference-maker for FPS games? We won’t need to wait long to find out, as the Legion Go is launching on October 31st. It’ll cost a surprisingly un-spooky £699 / $699.

I’m roughly 23 hours in, so I still have many galaxies ahead of me, but read Game Informer’s Starfield review for in-depth thoughts on the overall package. With years of build-up and anticipation, I, like many Bethesda Game Studios fans, let my imagination run wild with what this new open world RPG could be. Now that I’ve played a decent chunk of it, it’s quite different from the studios’ Elder Scrolls and Fallout series in some ways. Those two franchises are significantly more open world than Starfield. In fact, Starfield feels more like a great sci-fi theme park with exciting points of interests rather than an open world adventure. But players looking for a replica space-based Fallout or Elder Scrolls adventure might …]]></summary>

Join us today on Twitch at 2:00 p.m. Central as we take a bloody journey through the game's genre-defining story campaign. Episodes will be uploaded to our Game Informer Shows YouTube channel the following Saturday morning. 
After 2006's Mortal Kombat: Armageddon seemingly concluded the franchise's main narrative, 2011's entry picked up the bloody pieces. It moved the saga forward by resetting the timeline, serving as a soft reboot that brought Mortal Kombat back to its 2D fighting roots and ushering in the return of the classic roster. MK 9's cinematic story mode served as an epiphany for the series and fighting games as a whole, establishing the blueprint for narrative fighting campaigns still utilized today. MK9's story also serves as the first chapter of the modern trilogy of games that Mortal Kombat 1 builds upon. For a whole lot more on MK9 and its development, you can read this feature on how the reboot saved the franchise.
Join editors Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard as they battle their way through MK 9 to see how its reimagined tournament holds up.

The announcement of Super Mario Bros. Wonder, which acted as the grand finale of June's Nintendo Direct, caught many off guard. Not only is Nintendo moving away from the well-worn tread of the New Super Mario Bros. franchise for the 2D side of the series, but it is taking Mario in new directions with a larger roster of playable characters, unprecedented gameplay conventions, and all-new power-ups. The result provided us with a trailer that not only garnered a massive reaction online when our favorite Italian plumber turned into an elephant, but also had us watching the footage on repeat in an attempt to ascertain as many details a…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I don't remember this at the time, but there were complaints about Skyrim's map when it came out, because it was just an extreme zoom out on the world. It wasn't dense with information; the map markers were often kind of an "it's in this area" guideline that were even less helpful if what you needed was in a barrow or otherwise underground. Starfield raises the bar by taking the bold step of having a map that is almost not a map.
I'm referring here to the planet surface map. The starmap is, like a couple of things I've experienced since being hustled through quite an accelerated inciting incident (Starfield's equivalent of Patrick Stewart dying in a sewer after he's charged you with saving the world), reminiscent of Mass Effect. You can select different galaxies, which have one or two solar systems in them, and then can zoom down and select specific planets or moons or whatever to warp to. Once you're wombling about on the surface being a naughty little space captain - or whatever, I don't judge what you're up to - well baby, I hope you like blue voids with a bit of topography.

It means the opening hours of the game can be particularly confusing, but the tips below, gathered by the Game Informer staff, should help alleviate at least some confusion you might be experiencing early in the game.
Stay On The Main Path, At Least For Awhile
Starfield lets you loose pretty quickly, and it is tempting to just start planet hopping right away, but you will do yourself a favor by sticking to the main path for at least a few hours. Our suggestion is that you play at least enough Constellation missions to find a mysterious temple. It may feel restrictive to hold yourself back, but you will be grateful to give yourself the time to learn…]]></summary>

In this much-anticipated sci-fi action epic, you step into the spaceboots of Prince Starfield, a fully customisable, unvoiced protagonist who must battle a cosmic menace in the course of a familiar, but thrillingly woven narrative with unabashed political dimensions.
Not to be confused with NickTitle’s rather more contemplative game of the same name, to say nothing of Kenneth Nietfeld’s swashbuckling romance Rick Starfield: Hero of Space and Time, or indeed Starfield from Graek Tarmikos, an avant garde reinterpretation of Breakout, joeAmerica Gayms’ Starfield is a straightforward but engrossing blend of action and customisation elements. It’s the same heady brew of role-playing possibilities we’ve come to expect from the resourceful creator of Abandoned Bog.

Even in the increasingly crowded marketplace of big, expansive games, Starfield stands out. Leveraging the gameplay Bethesda popularized with The Elder Scrolls and Fallout games, Starfield expands the breadth of exploration to a galaxy of solar systems, planets, and ships. It populates those environments with a rich palette of activities and missions that tap into the outer space fantasy. It’s a staggering span of content to wrap one’s head around. At times, that scope threatens to impair the focus and pacing, and moment-to-m…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today’s Super Mario Bros. Wonder Nintendo Direct spilled a lot of tea on the upcoming game (read about it here) and concluded with the reveal of a new Switch OLED model. If you love the color red, then Nintendo has a console for you. 
The Mario Red Edition Switch OLED is coated in the plumber’s classic shade of red and the dock even includes a couple of Mario silhouettes and hidden coins on the backside, as you can see in the photo below. 
The console does not include a copy of Wonder, mainly because it hits store shelves a couple of weeks beforehand on October 6. Super Mario Bros. Wonder, meanwhile, launches on October 20. Still, if you're a passionate Mario fan looking for an excuse to upgrade to an OLED model, this version will set you back $349.99.]]></summary>

However, today's showcase was packed to the brim with gameplay reveals and new details, and now we've got a much clearer picture of what this game will look like. Wonder no longer: here's everything we learned from the Super Mario Bros. Wonder Direct.


The game starts when Prince Florian, ruler of the Flower Kingdom, has his castle stolen by Bowser. After fusing with a Wonder Flower, the king of the Koopas is able to fly over this new land, populating it with his chaotic cronies. As always, it's up to Mario and friends to save the day, but this time around, he's got more buddies than usual. In addition to Luigi, Peach, and a pair of Toa…]]></summary>

This month we’ve been pondering Aperture Desk Job: a "playable short" Valve created as a Steam Deck accompaniment, yet still manages to squeeze in some deliciously ironic character beats and at least one mantis-based tragedy. We’ll be discussing it in the liveblog below from 4pm BST, and we want to know your thoughts too. Liked it? Loathed it? Have design feedback for the toilet turrets? We wanna hear ‘em, so join us by posting in the liveblog widget’s comments bit. See you in an hour, ish.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lord Of The Rings: Return To Moria is a survival game that certainly shares something in common with both Valheim and Deep Rock Galactic: you and a few buds sink pits and set out on expeditions to mine ore, batter monsters, and push further into the darkness. Having watched its game director Jon-Paul Dumont steer me through a 30-minute demo, I’ve come away with the impression it’s far more than just a cheap LOTR pretender. The game strikes me as a real competitor, with well thought out story beats and crafting treats to make Moria’s restoration a hearty adventure… or, if you'd prefer, the equivalent of a Powerwash Simulator.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this month, Capcom teased an all-new character named A.K.I. coming to Street Fighter 6 as a DLC fighter. Now, the company has revealed that A.K.I will hit the game later next month on September 27 alongside a twisted gameplay reveal trailer. 
When A.K.I. joins the fight next month, she’ll be the 20th playable character in Street Fighter 6, following the first DLC fighter, Rashid, who hit the game in July. Like Rashid and all future DLC fighters, players will encounter A.K.I. across all three modes of Street Fighter 6: World Tour, Fighting Ground, and the Battle Hub. 
Check out the A.K.I. gameplay trailer for yourself below for a taste of what to expect:

        <updated>2023-08-31T11:45:15.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over the past week, dataminers have been rifling through Baldur's Gate 3's code and have discovered a dragon's hoard of alleged "cut content". It's hard to specify what they've unearthed without accidentally sounding the Major Spoilers trumpet and initiating Armageddon, but the supposed buried offerings include additional areas, swathes of dialogue, storylines, cutscenes, characters, romance opportunities and even deities. Given just how much Larian's gargantuan RPG gives you to play with, I am kind of thankful for a generous amount of stuff being "left out" - certainly, I don't need any more romanceable NPCs, I'm already fending them off with a broomhandle. But the news has gone down badly with a few players, and especially those who feel the game's overall quality takes a dive in acts 2 and 3.


Developers have come to Larian's defence, amongst them David Gaider, former Baldur's Gate 2 and Dragon Age writer, who is nowadays creative director of Summerfall Games, creator of the very earwormy STRAY GODs: The Roleplaying Musical. "Not surprised to hear of the amount of stuff apparently cut from BG3," Gaider wrote on Twix. "BG2 had a mountain of stuff cut over its development, some early and some even after lots of work had gone into it... almost every game does. Every DA game did. Heck, even Stray Gods had some considerable cuts."

The sinks are full of gunk and there are children hiding in the cupboards. Oh, and the darker stretches of floor are covered with writhing tentacles. This is Holstin, a Polish survival horror experience in which you merrily rove an isolated town that, based on 14 minutes of fumbling around in exactly one very unwelcoming house, already seems a match for Silent Hill in terms of existential squalor. A public playtest is underway, and I've got a trailer for you through the jump.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Officially unveiled at this week's Panic Games Showcase, Arco is a triptych of revenge stories set across the deserts, plains and forests of a fantastical, South American-style landscape. It's a part of the world we don't often get to see in games, and its stunning pixel art (and tiny cute little llamas) instantly caught my eye when I got to play an early mission from it at last week's Gamescom. Made by four developers spread across the globe, the official genres listed on its Steam page describe it as a tactical turn-based action adventure RPG where you guide four separate heroes in their fight against the ominous sounding Red Company. But just saying it's turn-based is doing Arco a disservice, I think, as it's also a little bit real-time, a little bit simultaneous turns, and all pretty brilliant, if you ask me. Here are some very early impressions of it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This year's Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 will make use of Modulate's ToxMod AI to help moderate voice chat in multiplayer, Activision have revealed. The system won't detect offences in real time, nor will it be able to kick you from games for effing and blinding. It just submits reports of bad behaviour, with Activision staff making the final call on enforcement actions, which might involve reviewing recordings to work out the context of an outburst.
You can turn off voice chat in Call of Duty to avoid being recorded, but it doesn't look like there's a way to opt out of AI voice moderation in the current/new Call of Duty games at the time of writing. The tech is being beta-tested from today, 30th August in Modern Warfare 2 and Warzone in North America, with the English-language worldwide release to land alongside Modern Warfare 3 on 10th November.

Set to hit PlayStation, Xbox, and PC for $49.99 with a scaled-back approach and a much shorter runtime, Ubisoft indicated it was using Mirage to return to the series’ roots, serving as a spiritual successor to Altair’s adventure that started it all. 
However, Mirage wasn’t always its own game; it started as DLC to 2020’s Assassin’s Creed Valhalla.

        <updated>2023-08-30T16:20:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, Sony announced the next slate of monthly games for the month of September. It also revealed that each subscription tier of PlayStation Plus is getting a significant price bump.
The PlayStation Blog reveals that September’s free games will be 2022’s Saints Row, Black Desert - Traveler Edition, and Generation Zero. They’ll become available on September 5 and can be downloaded until October 2.
On September 6, 12-month subscriptions for PlayStation Plus Essential, Extra, and Premium will be raised to the following prices:
Essential - $79.99 (from $59.99)
Extra - $134.99 (from $99.99)
Premium - $159.99 (from $119.99)
You can read this article for a refresher on the benefits of each subscription tier, which will not be changing. Current 12-month subscribers will not see these prices take effect until their next renewal date occurring on or after November 6. Changing your membership (such as buying more time or upgrading/downgrading tiers) on or after September 6 means paying the new prices, though. Sony also states that the new prices remain at a discounted rate compared to the single or three-month options. Sony has not revealed the new monthly/quarterly rates.
In the blog post, Sony explains the changes by stating, “This price adjustment will enable us to continue bringing high-quality games and value-added benefits to your PlayStation Plus subscription service.” It’s worth noting that, for now, Sony has not announced any new, additional benefits following the pricing updates.
The move comes at a time when several streaming and subscription services have raised their fees, so it’s not entirely surprising. But if you’re looking to sign up for PS Plus or extend/change a subscription, now would be the time in order to save some money.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a February 2022 Nintendo Direct, it was announced that the first three mainline Front Mission games would get modern remakes exclusively for Switch. Front Mission 1st: Remake hit last November, and now, nearly a year later, we finally know when Front Mission 2 will arrive.
That date is October 5, following a delay from it's previously announced June 12 launch. Front Mission 2’s revival is significant because it has never been released outside of Japan, originally hitting shelves in 1997. Set 12 years after Front Mission 1st, it stars Ash, an O.C.U. soldier who tries to escape the nation of Alordesh after its overrun by a revolutionary group, only to discover a broader conspiracy. Check out its story trailer below. 


The remake’s features include improved loading times (addressing a big criticism of the original version), free camera movement, a revamped soundtrack, new coloring/camouflage options, and additional language support. 
Front Mission 2: Remake will be available for $34.99. To keep up with every major upcoming remake, be sure to visit our complete list of them here.]]></summary>

These remasters were revealed last September, packaged into the same collection and given a release window of 2023 for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC via Steam. However, that was the last time we heard of these games. Yesterday evening, Konami gave us an update, stating they had been delayed out of 2023.

Konami says it will share further release information as soon as it becomes available on official channels.

The government-backed Cinema Fund says piracy carries “reputational risks” and that would be “inappropriate” right now. A furious cinema chief has accused the fund and government of protecting Western copyright holders. He says that Russia needs pirated copies of Barbie in cinemas, sooner rather than later.
