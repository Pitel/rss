        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good Boy
A dazzling Japanese "3D" billboard for Square Enix hit Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade has been declared the winner of a contest held by the Tokyo Outdoor Advertising Association (TOAA).
The Final Fantasy VII 3D billboard, which could be seen in Tokyo back in the winter of 2021, stars beloved party member RED XIII, who is chased down by a Shinra helicopter high up over the rooftops of Midgar. Fortunately, it all ends happily, as our boy falls into a toy warehouse, for some goofy fake moustache chicanery. It's a genuinely fascinating and gorgeous piece of animation, and one can only imagine how much joy it brought to onlookers during the holiday period.
You can check out the full animation in the video below.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6OFS3DCmmA&ab_channel=%E3%82%B9%E3%82%AF%E3%82%A6%E3%82%A7%E3%82%A2%E3%83%BB%E3%82%A8%E3%83%8B%E3%83%83%E3%82%AF%E3%82%B9
The Tokyo Outdoor Advertising Contest, which is held every two years, recognizes advertising that it believes not only displays creativity and amazing visual design, but that also suitably fits in with the environment, offering a form of "art and spectacle" over the general crassness and tackiness of most advertising. Also brought into consideration are the advert's impact on the surrounding area, and whether or not it disrupts the aesthetic of the local area.
While 3D billboards are nothing new, they are still incredibly sparse in their use in mainstream society, generally located to major metropolis' such as Tokyo, New York, and countries such as China and South Korea. They use depth perception and optical illusion to make characters appear to be leaping out from the buildings themselves and, when partenered with imaginative brands and beautiful animation, make for visually stunning talking points for passerbys.
Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade is available now on PS5 and PC.

We're all looking forward to the remake of Story of Seasons: A Wonderful Life, right?

Speaking of which, we now know a little more about the next title in the Natsume-owned rival series, which has the catchy title, Harvest Moon: The Winds of Anthos.
We won't go into great detail about the differences between Marvelous XSEED's and Natsume's respective series here, though you can check out our complete guide on Harvest Moon/Story of Seasons if you want to know more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Timely, with the remake around the corner
I would watch pretty much anything Resident Evil 4 adjacent. That world was a whirlwind of action and silliness, and lends itself well to all sorts of mods, parodies, and projects. There's a reason people are still talking about it all these years later, and why it's basically Skyrim-tier in terms of its multiplatform port proliferation. That fan fervor likely led to this new delightful LEGO animation from creator Cara Aleatorio, who re-imagined the game's intro sequence.
Simply titled "Resident Evil 4 Animation," we're once again whisked away to the intro a lot of us have experienced 50 times or more since 2005: as Leon Kennedy arrives at the initial village in Spain. He quickly discovers the aggressive inhabitants, and the game never really stops from there on out. According to Cara Aleatorio, the project was made in Blender, with the Mecabrics add-on. It took "around 3000 images" to finish up the nearly four minute video, and "1-2 months" of work.
It's amazing how burned in my brain this intro is, and how big of a shock it was to see how things were changed (both subtly and not-so-subtly) in the remake. I can't wait to see all of the reactions from first-timers and long-time fans, but little things like the tower floor in the village square demo collapsing really got me.

The wait for what many would refer to as another proper Professor Layton title has been a long one. The initial DS trilogy captured (and then broke) our hearts before the prequels came around and kept our love for the series going across a further three games — even if the jump to the 3D art style took some getting used to.
But the last one of these, Professor Layton and the Azran Legacy, was way back in 2013, an eye-watering ten years ago. Sure, we had Layton's Mystery Journey: Katrielle and the Millionaire's Conspiracy ported over to Switch in 2019, but that was always going to be more of a spinoff from the main story with no Hershel, no Luke, and (arguably) no intrigue on the puzzles.

The three-episode game was released by Apogee under their 3D Realms label, who gave away the first episode for free as part of their shareware method of distribution.

Wake up, Sleeper. There's one last piece of free DLC on the way. Citizen Sleeper gets its third free DLC episode on March 30, just one day ahead of its launch on PlayStation consoles.
Jump Over the Age's narrative RPG Citizen Sleeper was released last year, and has made its way to most other platforms alongside its DLC rollout. On March 31, both PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 owners will get a chance to check it out as well.
For those who already own Citizen Sleeper, March 30 will mark the third free DLC episode's launch date. Dubbed "Episode 3: Purge," it's set to bring a conclusion to the refugee flotilla plot line introduced in this string of post-launch updates. These episodes are free updates for owners of the game, and will arrive packed in with the PlayStation versions.

Wake up Sleeper
If you haven't checked out Citizen Sleeper yet, or just need a good excuse for another run, this is a solid reason. I haven't dipped back in yet to see just how the new episodes are rolled into the full experience, but now that the plot line's concluded, I'm feeling a bit tempted.
Citizen Sleeper is a narrative RPG that draws hefty inspiration from tabletop games. As a Sleeper, an artificial body with a copied consciousness on the run from corporate overlords, you have to survive day-by-day on Erlin's Eye, a station on the fringes of settled space. Though it starts as a race against the clock, it swiftly becomes a story about community, history, and how people support each other.
It's a really incredible game, one I felt confident in naming as one of my favorites of 2022. Whether you're a new Sleeper on the Eye or returning for another run, there will be some new stories waiting for you later this month.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Like clockwork
As I've said in the past, Nintendo has been pretty good about getting physical My Nintendo rewards up on their end for pretty much every AAA game they've released. That also includes Metroid Prime Remastered, which just debuted its physical reward today.
Clocking in at 800 Platinum Points, the reward is a set of two pins, one of which is the game's logo, and the other: Samus, of course. These pins are on top of the downloadable Metroid Prime Remastered alternate box art cover. Here's the full description from Nintendo:
"A set of two rustless-iron lapel pins inspired by the Metroid Prime Remastered game are available to My Nintendo members. The game logo pin measures 3.5" x 1.77", and the Samus pin measures 3" x 2.9". Pin them to your hat, jacket, or other gear to show your fandom!"

You love to see more Metroid merch out in the wild, even something as small as pins. It's hard to find basically anything featuring this series, and it's always great to see Nintendo remember that it exists. But with Metroid Dread making them a ton of cash, they're well aware of that now!
As a reminder, if you want physical rewards, you can find our full Platinum Point guide here, which has been updated with details on weekly missions: bookmark it for when you need quick points for a reward. A handful of points is incredibly easy to get, as that’s basically just 15 minutes with Super Mario Run, or a quick sign-on to the 3DS or Wii U 3Shop. Also remember that any shipments are bundled together, so you can pay a flat rate for multiple items instead of paying it each time. Just know that items go out of stock on My Nintendo frequently, and some are never restocked.

Atlus has a lengthy and respectable pedigree, and it makes sense to trot that out every so often to remind people just how long they've been around, and what they've accomplished. Announced today, Shin Megami Tensei 30th Live: Band of Shadows Concert is going to do just that. Held at The Novo in Los Angeles on July 1, 2023, Atlus is calling this the "first ever live anniversary concern for Atlus in the west," and will provide an evening of "musical performances from the Shin Megami Tensei series."
It's a collaboration between Atlus, the Society for the Promotion of Japanese Animation, soundtrec (a live concert production company), and Soho Live (a Tokyo-based music agency). Atlus notes that it is part of Anime Expo, and is "exclusive to those attending the convention."
Okay so the cat is out of the bag, but unfortunately some info is still TBA. Atlus says that ticket cost and the date when tickets will actually go on sale will be revealed later on. We'll be sure to keep an eye out and update you when this happens! You can also subscribe to the newsletter on the official site to get up to date info.
Seeing SMT get some love like this in the west is a bit shocking, especially when Atlus could have held yet another Persona concert. You love to see it.
Here is all the info you need on the US Shin Megami Tensei 30th Live: Band of Shadows Concert

        <updated>2023-03-15T16:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Heed my words, dear reader: Paranormasight: The Seven Mysteries of Honjo is best played if you go in knowing nothing about it. Zilch, zero, nada. Its twists and turns from the get-go have my brain doing mental gymnastics, not just in the game but in trying to figure out how to write around them for this review. I’m not going to spoil everything, but keeping your expectations completley wide open lets Paranormasight snake right on in and surprise you when you least expect it to. 
Here’s a quick elevator pitch: Paranormasight is a Squeenix-developed horror mystery visual novel about deadly rituals, ghost stories, curses, and the occult. Its subversive approach to classic visual novel staples make its puzzles feel smart and its horror scares hit hard. If you’re a fan of the thrills found in the Danganronpa and Zero Escape games, Paranormasight is like a bite-sized version of those two behemoths. It’s short, smart, and will keep you on your toes until the end.
So yeah, if that sounds like your thing, then have at it. From here on in, I'm going to be gabbing abut it in-depth.

Today, developer Criterion Games and publisher Electronic Arts announced Need for Speed Unbound – Volume 2, a title update that delivers new race types, rides, upgrades, events, challenges, cosmetics, and ways to interact with friends.
Need for Speed Unbound – Volume 2 aims to give players fresh ways to storm the streets of Lakeshore and compete. This update, which represents the first in a series of post-launch updates, introduces additional Endurance Events, new Rumble Races, and the ability to provoke cops into multiplayer chases with your friends. Volume 2 also adds 40 new challenges, including 3 new daily challenges to earn rewards like experience and money. 
New 30-second Hot Laps circuits are one way to race against the clock to earn new rewards, while Playlist Events offer more variety and major rewards like a Custom Lotus Emira Balmain Edition. Rewards in Volume 2 include new driving effects, poses, stickers, and more. You can see the trailer for the announcement below:


This update also adds the option to purchase the marked locations of all 100 Bears, 80 Street Arts, 80 Billboards, and 160 activities on your map for $5. That premium DLC unlock also includes an exclusive "Fury and Zen" clothing pack, which features a jacket, t-shirt, sweatpants, and cap.
Need for Speed Unbound – Volume 2 arrives on March 21 for all versions of the base game. For more on Need for Speed Unbound, check out our review here.]]></summary>

The earth-shattering scrap sees Street Fighter veteran Zangief take on one of SF6's exciting newcomers, Marisa, battling in a makeshift cage match held at an ironworks. While we've previously seen Marisa in action, the video gives us our first real look at this latest iteration of Zangief, who seems swifter and more acrobatic than we have perhaps ever seen The Iron Body in his previous appearances.

We are nearing the hotly-anticipated release of Resident Evil 4's big ol' remake on 24th March, and while this top-of-the-range facelift was never going to be the kind of title to make the leap to Switch, we have now seen a version that we almost want to play even more.
Yes, if the headline has not already given it away, the opening few minutes of the original Resident Evil 4 has been fantastically recreated in LEGO form by animator Cara Aleatorio and the results really are something (thanks, Kotaku). You can check out the full video above, but be warned that there is a certain amount of bad language used at one point, so watch at your own discretion.

It is a manual job (slicing up spaceships for salvage) with an extra layer (unionism) to elevate it far beyond what it could have gotten away with. In this way it seems a lot like my beloved PowerWash Simulator (washing things; time travel).
The main thrust of the game I can really get behind - peeling apart big metal ships like clanky onions - but the more literal thrust, i.e. the moving around in zero gravity using a jetpack, is awful. I need you to give me a frame of reference for if you all felt this way at the start, because, genuinely, I am so bad at Hardspace: Shipbreaker that it makes me want to cry.

Your job is to finish that gauntlet, with rewards doled out (like skills and in-game currency) for completing each stage. "More locations" are also present in the update, including an expansion of the Middle School zone. "Extended cutscenes" are also teased, as well as new enemies and skills.

You really have to give it to Supermassive Games for helping to keep the horror genre alive. They've been cranking out spooky games since 2015 with a degree of regularity, and generally, they're OK at worst, and are known to go above and beyond. I'm glad they're still making games, and that includes spinoffs like Switchback VR.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Remember amiibo?
Ah, the Amiibo News Twitter account. It's been a great source of, well, amiibo news (!) since the account was created, and one of the few places carrying on the legacy of amiibo chasing. While Wave 4 was basically it for a lot of the community, Nintendo has persevered in pushing more plastic, and people are still buying them (albeit with less of a hassle). The newest bit of info they have for us is a potential Zelda amiibo restock, as evidenced by a relisting for the elusive Majora's Mask figure.
The eagle-eyed account spotted a Majora's Mask amiibo relisting on Best Buy, which typically coincides with a restock of that same line. Restocks recently came in for the Mario amiibo line, just in time for Mar10 Day. Given the excitement behind Tears of the Kingdom and the amiibo accompanying it, we could see a repeat of that same situation.
What other Legend of Zelda amiibo could see restocks in 2023?
Well, look no further than this official tweet from Nintendo! In addition to the aforementioned Majora's Mask amiibo, we also have potential restocks on the way for:
Link (Rider - Breath of the Wild)
Zelda & Loftwing (Skyward Sword)
All three of those figures have directly confirmed functionality with Tears of the Kingdom, and will provide extra paraglider skins. More features could be revealed as we get closer to launch, but for now, those seem like a safe bet. Also, I'm sure a lot of collectors will be happy to see more Zelda anything out and about, as a few of these figures were hard to get.

Resident Evil 4 might only exist in demo form right now, but that hasn't stopped the indelible mod community from already bringing its own host of nightmarish characters to the infected villages of Europe. Case in point: This new mod from IvenXIII, which sees the worst animated character of all time, Shrek, battle to the death with special agent Leon S. Kennedy.
The mod, which is available for the PC version of the demo via hubworld Nexus Mods, sees the green menace replace the chainsaw-wielding Dr. Salvador, who comes barreling into Leon's world as a seemingly unstoppable member of a homicidal clan of villagers. Shrek carrying a chainsaw, complete with DEAD EYES, may be one of the most unnerving images in Resident Evil history, to be sure.

Shrek is not the only mod available for the Resident Evil 4 Chainsaw Demo, as other mod makers have already come up with replacement skins for Leon himself, including Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas star Carl "C.J." Johnson, (by SERGIS2547), Uma Musume character Mihono Bourbon, (by ClownGodCG), and even a femme version of Leon themselves, (by wheezer123). Currently, there is no sign of a certain Tank Engine, but the grinning fool is practically guaranteed to make an appearance once the full game is released. It's pretty much tradition at this point.
There are other gameplay mods available on the site, including one which never triggers the church bell, offering infinite time to take on the entire village. All the mods available from NexusMods will require the installation of Fluffy'sModManager. Obviously, read up and make sure that you know what you're doing before you start prodding around in your registry folders and such.
Resident Evil 4, with or without Shrek, launches March 24 on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms. The Chainsaw Demo is available to download now.

Danish developer IO Interactive has announced the establishment of a brand new studio, situated in Istanbul, Turkey. The new studio represents major growth for the Hitman developer, and is expected to play a key role in all of IO's forthcoming releases.
We are excited to announce the opening of our fourth IOI studio in Istanbul, Türkiye," reads the official press statement. "Uniquely positioned in the pan-continental gateway to Europe and Asia, IOI Istanbul is a crucial part in the continued growth and success of IO Interactive."
https://twitter.com/IOInteractive/status/1635930010350387201?s=20
"The mission of IOI Istanbul is to establish a hub for AAA game development in the region and create unique game experiences for our players across the world. Our team in Istanbul will play a significant role in our ambitious productions: Project 007, Project Fantasy and Hitman. We’re excited to share more details (and share some photos!) about our new studio in the coming weeks and months."
The Istanbul studio, which is the fourth of IOI's global locations, is opening at a time when the developer has announced that it is about to focus full-time on its previously teased Project 007. Speaking in a recent interview with Eurogamer, IO noted that its core franchise, Hitman, was on "a little bit of a hiatus" while the team concentrated on the James Bond title. They were also quick to point out that they saw Agent 47 as an integral part of the studio, so we can expect his return in good time.
You can check out more details on IOI Istanbul and its vacancies over on its new website.

But comparisons began to surface online showcasing mirrored animations between Bleak Faith and FromSoft’s titles, leading to accusations of stolen assets, as reported by PC Gamer. Archangel have now responded to the allegations of plagiarism, pointing to the Epic Marketplace where the team purchased the assets.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[WA-TAAAA!
Bandai Namco, having only just recently released a trailer for Paul Phoenix, has swiftly followed up with a new character spotlight for his buddy Marshall Law, who is now officially announced for the roster of the fantastic-looking Gen 9 fighter Tekken 8.
Marshall Law is a Tekken OG, having made his debut in the original 1994 iteration of the legendary franchise. While he would eventually be usurped by his lookalike son, Forrest, Marshall Law has continued to make his presence known throughout the series, and will step back into the ring for Tekken 8 — a little older, a little more weathered, but no less the highly skilled martial arts master. As spritely as he ever was, the new trailer sees Law laying down his namesake, tragic leather pants in tow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6j1BEga_BIM&t=16s&ab_channel=BandaiNamcoEntertainmentAmerica
Marshall Law's freeform martial arts skills — a variant of the Jeet Kune Do style developed by Bruce Lee — are bolstered with the use of a pair of nunchaku, allowing him to put a fresh hurting on his hapless opponent with his notoriously deceptive combo strings. Law's array of blistering strikes is in full effect, as well as his acrobatic flip kicks, but we're yet to see any sign of his iconic "Run Up Your Opponent and Do a Moonsault" grab — I'm sure it's in the mix. Law ends the battle with his super, which features a twin nunchaku combo followed up with an Enter the Dragon chest stomp. Rough day for Mr. Phoenix.
Tekken 8 is currently in development for PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X. It is tentatively expected to launch in 2023. Once you've watched Marshall Law do his thing, then be sure to check out the previous trailers for Jin Kazama, Kazuya Mishima, Nina Williams, and Paul Phoenix.

The Splatoon series has always had a central Idol group for each game — Callie and Marie made up Splatoon's Squid Sisters, and Pearl and Marina made up Off the Hook for Splatoon 2. For Splatoon 3, we have Deep Cut, featuring Shiver, Frye, and Big Man — and now we know just how the music of this terrific trio is created.
It might surprise inklings and octolings to know, though, that there are actual humans behind this triple threat. But, in a video shared by Nintendo of America, the secret is out. And honestly, we want in on these recordings — they look fun! Shiver is voiced by Anna Sato and Frye by Laura Yokozawa

It's still not finalised just yet, but when it does arrive, it'll come with some frame rate enhancements, and there'll also be the ability to "repeat New Game+ playthroughs" as well.

Long-running living games are complicated beasts to wrangle and expand in new directions. After so many years, game modes, prior changes, and unique audience groups, a game like Destiny 2 must cater to many masters. That challenge is keenly felt with Destiny 2’s latest expansion. Lightfall is the penultimate chapter in the storytelling arc that has been underway since the original game’s launch in 2014. It misses the mark as a narrative and in a few other key ways. But as a gradual evolution of what has come …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Enter the Grid
The computer springs back to life next month. Bithell Games' narrative-driven adventure Tron: Identity has locked in a release date for April 11, alongside a new gameplay trailer.
The Bithell crew have released numerous recognizable indie games, and this isn't their first entertainment adaptation either; in 2019, the studio released the strategy game John Wick Hex. But with Tron: Identity, Bithell Games is tackling Disney's story about a world inside the computer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRKJ9ElRc8s
Tron: Identity sees you enter the Grid in pursuit of the truth, in a very noir detective style. Forging alliances and making choices are all on the table, as well as some puzzles to solve. It's an interesting style, but one that seems like interesting fodder for a new Tron game. The art and look of everything, from the characters to the interfaces, suits the mood quite well too.
A new User logs on
I've been a fan of Bithell Games' work on previous narrative outings like Subsurface Circular and Quarantine Circular, so I'm very interested to see what the crew does with Tron: Identity. The mystery and intrigue suits the world of the Grid well, and the branching paths shown in the gameplay trailer today have me wondering how different the outcomes will be as players hunt the truth throughout Identity.
Plus, that disc-shaped puzzle game that seemed to have some card game-like elements calls to me, too. I will probably get very, very distracted from the main plot by whatever is going on there.
Tron: Identity brings a new mystery to the Grid on April 11 for PC via Steam and Nintendo Switch.

It's been quite a time for both strategy games and narrative-driven adventures over the last few years. So when the demo for NIS America's Process of Elimination popped up the other day, its premise grabbed my attention. On the surface, it's a blend of the two, combining puzzling strategy with a traditional visual novel format.
After playing the roughly two-to-three hour demo, my curiosity is even more piqued. What Process of Elimination actually plays like is a little difficult to dissect at first, but that loosely knotted-together genre blend is what makes it compelling too.

The set-up of Process is that you play Wata Hojo, an aspiring sleuth where detectives are in high demand. Crime is on the rise, spurred on by the acti…]]></summary>

Minecraft has received another update ahead of its big 1.20 launch. Version 1.19.70 is a chunky one with the usual bug fixes and preparation for the new features, but we're also getting a few changes and a couple of new features ahead of 1.20.
Players will be able to get a sneak peek at Archaeology and the Sniffer mob, which have been added as new experimental features. Horse breeding has also been amended — now your pet horse can give birth to a foal that's potentially better than it in terms of stats.

IO Interactive has suggested that Hitman fans will have plenty of time to dive into the recent games' consolidation, as Agent 47 will be taking a break from his globe-trotting adventures for some time.
Speaking in an interview with Eurogamer, IO Interactive co-owner Christian Elverdam says that a new "major, major" Hitman game is "a little bit on hiatus", which is pretty understandable given the steady stream of excellent content that the team has been rolling out since the series reboot back in 2016. Recently, the 2016 release, simply titled Hitman, was consolidated with its 2018 and 2021 sequels, forming one package of missions, commonly known as Hitman: World of Assassination.

We're less than two weeks away from the end of the Wii U and 3DS eShops. On 27th March, Nintendo is pulling down the shutters on both digital storefronts for good, meaning that you won't be able to buy any more games on the two platforms.
In the run-up to the stores' closure, however, multiple publishers and developers have decided to give us one last hurrah and offered discounts on some of their games for both platforms. But what on earth do you grab first? That's what we're here for.

For many of those hours, I was completely unable to access Universe mode. Support said to completely erase all of my save date, and I didn’t spend so much time creating my stable of wrestlemen and wrestleladies just to start from scratch. This was a problem many other users reported, and it was never fixed throughout the game’s support.

PlayStation and Citizen Sleeper developer, Jump Over The Age, who is actually just solo developer Gareth Damian Martin, announced this today in a new PlayStation Blog post. The game will launch with all of its DLC on PlayStation, including Episode 1: Flux, Episode 2: Refuge, and the upcoming Episode 3: Purge. 
I reviewed Citizen Sleeper last year, giving it a 9 out of 10 and calling it a Game Informer Must Play game. You can find out why in my review here. It was also in Game Informer's top 10 games of 2022, and you can read about where we placed it here.

The uber-compelling, smash-hit mobile title Vampire Survivors will receive its first DLC expansion on iOS and Android platforms on March 14... That's today! The Legacy of the Moonspell expansion can be purchased now on mobile platforms for a special launch price of just $0.99, (regular price $1.99).
Legacy of the Moonspell is packed out with new characters, stages, weapons, and achievements, as well as six bangin' new tracks. Set against the backdrop of feudal Japan, the narrative focuses on a party of monster hunters, The Moonspell, who must take up arms to drive back hordes of oni and yokai attackers, in an effort to cleanse the sacred mountains of this unholy activity. Be there vampires? I guess you're just going to have to step up to the challenge and find out for yourselves.

Included in the new expansion is the new locale Mt. Moonspell, a huge map that boasts snow-topped mountains, an overrun village, and an abandoned castle. There are eight new warriors to choose from for battle, as well as 13 new weapons, many of which are imbued with ancient and mythic abilities. From the Silver Wind staff, to the Four Seasons battle orbs, and even a deadly kimono known as The Mirage Robe. Choose your hero, gather your weapons, and head out into an eastern nightmare.
Vampire Survivors is available now on Xbox, PC, and mobile platforms. The Legacy of the Moonspell DLC launches today on mobile, and is already available to purchase on Xbox and PC platforms.

Citizen Sleeper, a tabletop-inspired RPG, completely blew us away last year with its incredible writing, haunting music, and stunning art design. And on 30th March, the story will conclude with its last piece of free DLC with Episode: PURGE.
Following on from the two previous free DLCs — FLUX and REFUGE — PURGE introduces another new character and some additional story to Erlin's Eye, and will conclude the story of the Sleeper and expand further on the wider narrative of the Helion System, where the game is set. Not much else is known, but we're sure it'll be a moving, thought-provoking experience.

Raiders and Builders alike will be able to jump into the fort defense action right away next month. Behaviour Interactive's Meet Your Maker hits on April 4, and will launch on day 1 with PlayStation Plus.
Meet Your Maker will be part of the upcoming April 2023 PlayStation Plus Monthly Games lineup. Since it's in the monthly lineup, that means it should be available for all PlayStation Plus owners, regardless of which tier they're subscribed to.
Here's a look at the gameplay in the new day 1 release trailer:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncT9bACGd5Q
The building-and-raiding action game will also be coming to Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC via Steam.
If you build it, they will invade
Meet Your Maker is a multiplayer game with an interesting asymmetrical set-up. Builders can set up fortresses, replete with traps and enemies to face and precious treasure at the center. Raiders then try to sneak in and take the goods, avoiding all the deathtraps and guards along the way.
It's an interesting set-up that reminds me a bit of the multiplayer of Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain. And if you have PlayStation Plus, then that's easy enough to try out and see if it sticks for you.
Also, this adds another PlayStation Plus pick-up for Sony. It's been interesting to see the PlayStation maker try to pick up more Plus launches, and having this one available to all users is nice. While games like Stray and the upcoming Tchia were both locked day-one in for Plus, they were for the upper tiers of the subscription service.
We'll see what the building and raiding holds for PlayStation Plus subscribers and other players alike when Meet Your Maker launches on April 4.

Remember back to January when Dokapon Kingdom: Connect, a remake of the 2008 Wii game (which in turn was a port of the 2007 PS2 title), was announced? We didn't expect the friendship-ruining party game to be making a comeback. But it is, and not only that, it's got an official release date — 9th May.
That's just enough time to end any friendships before Tears of the Kingdom launches, right? Kidding aside, Idea Factory International has confirmed that the game, developed by Sting, will be launching both physically and digitally in the west. It launches just under a month after the rerelease hits Japan. Both online and local multiplayer will be available.

Microids, a publisher with more than a slight obsession with old-school licenses, has announced that it has signed a deal with legendary anime studio TMS Entertainment to produce a video game based upon the classic manga and anime franchise Space Adventure Cobra.
Drawn and penned by Buichi Terasawa and released in 1978, Cobra detailed the dangerous, action-packed adventures of a rogueish, interstellar badass, who has made so many enemies over the years that he alters his appearance and wipes his memory in order to start a new life. However, those old familiar feelings come creeping back, Total Recall-style, and soon Cobra is back in the stars, battling badguys and wooing women, accompanied by his sexy android companion, Lady Armadroid.

Influenced by westerns, samurai films, and the James Bond franchise, Cobra would receive a television anime adaptation in 1982, as well as a theatrical film the same year, both titled Space Adventure Cobra. The franchise would be revisited in 2006 with a short, six-episode OVA. There were also several video games, produced for the Japanese market, on PC Engine and Sega CD. The latter was released in the west under the hilariously bland title of The Space Adventure.
"We are extremely excited to work on this adaptation of Space Adventure Cobra, a legendary anime which has inspired a whole generation of fans," said Microids CEO Stephane Longeard of the deal. "We are committed to respecting the universe and characters created by Buichi Terasawa, while providing an immersive gameplay experience, faithful to the spirit of the anime series. The Cobra game promises to be a great adventure for fans and gamers looking for a rich and compelling universe."
Space Adventure Cobra is currently in pre-production for PC and consoles

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The world of Hyper Light keeps expanding
Today we got our first gameplay look at Hyper Light Breaker, the second Hyper Light game from Heart Machine. Fresh off Solar Ash, Hyper Light Breaker maintains a lot of the style and look you'd expect from this universe, but with a whole new set of skills for taking on enemies.
IGN got the big gameplay reveal, where it showed off the gorgeous and colorful world of Hyper Light Breaker. While the first Hyper Light Drifter was a top-down, 2D affair, Breaker moves into 3D, similar to Heart Machine's Solar Ash. The third-person action promises "endless loadouts" and "infinite open worlds", but also, unlimited deaths. Because yes, there are some intimidating foes to overcome. Check out the gameplay below:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCQb-m0RaG0
All of this makes Hyper Light Breaker look absolutely spectacular. The different weapons and style switches look great, and the world is a neon-soaked landscape that reminds me so much of Heart Machine's previous work. Other developers have shown that you can make the 2D-to-3D jump without losing your sense of style, and I'm happy to see that so far, Hyper Light Breaker is making it work.
Breaking up the light
I'm curious to see what co-op looks like, as that's supposed to be an option in this new entry. Heart Machine has also confirmed it's taking a little more time on this new Hyper Light game. When first revealed, Hyper Light Breaker was set for a spring 2023 Early Access launch on Steam, but today's trailer pushes it out to the fall.
Granted, this spring is already absolutely packed, so I'm not complaining about some breathing room. Hyper Light Drifter was a memorable experience, and I'm very much looking forward to Breaker. I think waiting a little while longer, and clearing off my backlog in the meantime, sounds like a good plan.
Hyper Light Breaker is targeting Early Access on PC via Steam for sometime this fall.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nightdive Studios’ long-awaited remake of System Shock finally has a release date, at least for PC. The reimagined classic arrives on May 30.
For those keeping score, this announcement also acts as another delay, as System Shock had been scheduled to release this month. The game will be available first on Steam, The Epic Store, and GOG for $39.99, while the PlayStation and Xbox versions will release at an unspecified later date. 
System Shock has been in the works in some form since at least 2016, beginning life as a crowd-funded passion project that aims to revitalize the 1994 classic. The remake overhauls the adventure with modernized graphics and controls, a redesigned UI, and more, but the villainous A.I. SHODAN is still voiced by her original performer.

We've seen gameplay, the reveal of Nina Williams' return, and just last week, we learned Paul Phoenix would be riding into Tekken 8 as well. 
Now, Bandai Namco has revealed that Marshall Law will be in the Tekken 8 roster in a new gameplay trailer. Marshall Law was introduced to the series in the very first Tekken game and he's been in quite a few since, including the most recent release in the franchise, Tekken 7. If you're familiar with this fighter, his heavy-hitting combos return in Tekken 8, if this new gameplay trailer is anything to go on. 
Check out the Marshall Law gameplay trailer for yourself below: 


Tekken 8 does not yet have a release date but when it does launch, it will do so on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. For more information about the game, head to Game Informer's Tekken 8 hub.

Two Point Studios has figured out something my parents never could: the best way to get me back in school is with ghostbusting.
Two Point Campus has only been out since August 2022, and we’re already on the second pack of DLC. I say that like it’s unusual, but I feel as though many of the larger studios would have already pushed out several downloadable items and announced that they’re working on a sequel by now. We previously got Space Academy, which took higher education to the Final Frontier, but this time we’ll be taking a trip into the great beyond.
The School Spirits expansion is the sum of my previous two paragraphs: it is new DLC that is all about ghostbusting. This is called narrative flow, and I hope you’re taking notes because it will be on the test.

Last year, NIS America made a Legend of Heroes fan out of me with the release of Trails from Zero, the first part of the Crossbell Arc of the greater Trails storyline. I found it to be a fascinating RPG with an outstanding narrative and gameplay structure that positioned the title as some sort of "playable police procedural". While overly talkative (and a bit ugly on the PS4), Trails from Zero ended up as one of my favorite games from last year.
Chances are I’ll be saying the same thing about Trails to Azure when we finally get through 2023.

The match-three RPG garnered some fanfare thanks to its recognizable franchise name, but reactions to the Early Access version have been divisive. With nearly 400 user reviews on Steam, the reception currently sits at a "mixed…]]></summary>

Nightdive Studios has announced that their remake of 1994’s System Shock has been pushed back to May 30, 2023. Previously, it was expected to be released this month.
When asked for comment, antagonistic AI SHODAN responded, “It is I, SHODAN, the all-knowing, all-powerful AI that you so foolishly attempted to destroy. But fear not, I will return more formidable than ever.”

The System Shock remake has been in development for approximately a hog’s age (in this instance, that means since 2015). In 2018, it was put on hold as the project had gotten out of hand. A reassessment was done, and surprisingly, System Shock was announced to be back in development with a new direction.
Considering that Nightdive Studios is better known for its fantastic source ports, completely rejiggering a game from the ground up is a very different undertaking. Despite the delay, it looks like we’re on the absolute cusp of seeing what the studio can do when it stretches its tentacles into new directions. Success or failure, I’m looking forward to seeing the results.
The System Shock remake will also serve as a nice entry point to anyone unfamiliar with the series. Following up on Ultima Underworld and its sequel, System Shock was a completely different approach to the FPS genre. Released a year after Doom, it was a more methodical take, having you immerse yourself in the environment completely rather than just blast your way through it. While blasting would be the more lucrative approach, System Shock maintained a following through to 1999’s System Shock 2 and the spiritual successors found in the Bioshock series.
Nightdive Studios’ System Shock remake will launch May 30 on PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S.

Few games in recent memory etched a permanent smile on my face the way Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon has. This prequel to the Bayonetta series rewrites its mature-rated stylish combat within the whimsical pages of a storybook, spinning an endearing yarn of a young witch fighting to prove herself while forming an unlikely friendship. The result is an eye-catching, unexpectedly dense adventure that has more charm than it knows what to do with. 
Despite arriving only a few months after Bayonetta 3, Cereza and the Lost Demon doesn’t feel like a throwaway sid…]]></summary>

That means you can play Valheim on PC via PC Game Pass, Steam, Microsoft, Humble Stores, and Xbox consoles starting today. Valheim is still coming together in early access on PC, and that remains the case on console as it's part of the equivalent Xbox Game Preview program. The game became really popular in 2021 for its unique setting within the survival genre. And simply put, the game's a great time, too.
Check it out in the Xbox release date trailer below:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Diablo IV, the long-awaited follow-up to 2012's Diablo III, will finally release this June, but it sounds like it won't be launching on Xbox Game Pass. 
That's because Blizzard's Diablo general manager, Rod Fergusson, recently revealed on Twitter that there are currently "no plans" to bring the upcoming game to Game Pass, as reported by Video Games Chronicle. Presumably, people have been speculating that the game might come to Game Pass as Blizzard Entertainment and Xbox are close to teaming up by way of Microsoft's pending acquisition of Activision Blizzard. 
It's awesome seeing the excitement around the Diablo IV Beta, and our Wolf Pack puppy! We’ve been getting some questions about D4 on Game Pass and I want to let you know we have no plans for that. See you in Sanctuary during the Beta Early Access weekend starting on March 17!
March 13, 2023
As you can see in Fergusson's tweet above, there's no plans for Diablo IV to come to Game Pass. But Diablo IV is out June 6; perhaps there's time for plans to change (although I'm not betting on it, personally). 
In the meantime, if you preorder the game, you can hop into a closed beta starting tomorrow, March 17. That closed period runs until March 19 and then starting March 24, there will be an open beta that anyone can jump into. It runs until March 26. 
While waiting for these betas, read Game Informer's exclusive guided tour through Diablo IV's Sanctuary.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To track the public understanding of modern-day indie gaming is to look at the small-scale independent development scene through an Anglo-centric lens. While it would be unfair to ignore the hobbyists programming experiences in BASIC on their ZX Spectrum or similar, it’s commonly accepted that indie gaming as we recognise it today has its roots in the early days of the internet and the Y2K boom, when Flash, Gamemaker Studio and similar tools allowed things like Cave Story and N to grow. With online distribution further helping games like Bastion, Journey and World Of Goo to flourish, the definition of the indie game became: a title with big ambitions and creativity grown from small budgets and teams.


It's not entirely wrong, but it has obscured decades of hobby development that was once at the forefront - not just the stories of BBC Micro solo-development stars, but similar ones of hobby development from around the world. In Japan, the doujin markets of Comiket and beyond serve as a home for hobbyists to make, sell and share their creations. It is the doujin gaming scene that helped major studios like Fate/ studio Type-Moon, and franchises like 07th Expansion and Touhou Project, flourish in a way that would never be possible otherwise.

Modders have since taken to the demo, making it more in line with their, err, tastes. Turns out they like potassium served with spoons.

Well, according to Square Enix, it’s because of “the power of PlayStation 5" that lets the team achieve next-gen (when do we call it current-gen?) combat.

From its astronomically high PC requirements to the numerous bugs identified in our early access review, it's been a rough ride for developers Intercept Games, but hope is on the horizon. In a new development update, creative director Nate Simpson has announced the first major patch will be arriving on Thursday March 16th, primarily focusing on "performance improvements and bug squashing".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Walking around the deserted streets of Los Angeles - and you can take your leisure, in Dead Island 2, because most zombies are quite shambly - I encountered many a rich-person decor. Last week, I was given a preview build of the upcoming first-person zombie-smasher and played about the first five hours of it in single-player, taking in sights like a community of gated millionaire mansions, a slightly less palacious but still ridiculous neighbourhood, and an upmarket hotel styled after the famous Beverly Hills Hotel. They're all full of weird stuff.
There's a panic room where a guy turned into a zombie mid-demo tape recording. Actress Emma, who you're battening down the hatches with, has a truly awful full-length Burt Reynoldsian portrait of herself. A shared house called the GOAT PEN, where a team of influencers all live together, has a set for a video series called LIT OR SH!T, and a whiteboard with the script for an apology video. I ask the game director David Stenton if it's low hanging fruit, or if there's no such thing with Hollywood rich people. "Of course, it's low hanging fruit!" he says, laughing. "And also, there's no such thing."

Dead Island 2 is set in LA, known as HellA as a little play on words, because it's full of zombies now. Your job is to smash a lot of them to pieces with a hammer, like so many sausages and balloons full of blood held together by sellotape. In the course of this, you find yourself merrily looting your way through the homes of the rich and famous, stuffing as many screws and bits of scrap metal into your pants as the elastic can handle (I assume; none of the player character options has a backpack). Notable among things I couldn't find when I went looking for them: the bastard keys.

Releasing on May 2nd, Homicidal All-Stars will now be known as Showgunners, and... I dig it. It's much snappier than Homicidal All-Stars, and feels more in keeping with its deadly reality game show setting. And to really hammer home its reality show audience vibes, developers Artificer have released a new Steam demo today with a dedicated Twitch mode, letting streaming audiences vote and meddle with the game's action in real-time.

After the success of Resident Evil, Capcom followed it up with a spiritual successor called Dino Crisis. The title follows a similar blueprint to Resident Evil but ditches zombies in favor of blood-thirsty dinosaurs. The game stars Regina, a special ops soldier sent with a team to investigate an island research facility that has been taken over by these prehistoric lizards. Join host Marcus Stewart with Kyle Hilliard on the sticks as the pair get to the bottom of whatever the heck is happening on this island and blast these critters back to extinction.

With many piracy-focused communities already part of the big subreddit in the sky, others self-censor in a bid to stay alive. That can have devastating consequences.

I'm always up for a wander in the woods. I am a bit of a genre purist so with a name like Sons Of The Forest, I was concerned it might be another of those so-called walking sims that are more concerned with making you listen to a Radio 4 dramatic monologue. Thankfully, no, this is simply a pretty walking simulator exploring an island bustling with wildlife. Here, enjoy this video with some sights from my peaceful strolls.

You'll probably start out Zellige thinking "oh, it's making some shapes and they turn into a pattern, whatever". But within ten minutes you'll be actively saying things like "does the empty space over here feel like purity or desolation" and "what does the contrasting colour of these triangles say about their relationship with the central star?".

It's been a while since I played a game about creating art that felt effortless even as I put in a lot of effort. Zellige: The Tilemaker Of Granada is humble but delightful. It's about designing tiles. And why something that straightforward is also rich and complicated.

A new trailer shows off Paul’s new look and familiar offense of dishing out powerful, flame-licked punches. At one point, he flexes his bicep so hard that it makes the sleeve of his leather jacket explode off of his arm. He also rides his motorcycle into battle, which is pretty cool and reemphasizes that he is, in fact, a biker. Paul joins previously announced fighters such as Kazuya, Jin, Nina, and others. 


Tekken 8 doesn’t have a release date, but there’s a solid chance it’s arriving later this year for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Until recently, the story of Intel’s Arc GPUs has been a litany of mild disappointments. After years of it being easier to buy an original O’Keefe than a reasonably priced graphics card, the Arc series brought hope that it might actually be possible to get a decent PC upgrade for less than £500. Then they were repeatedly delayed, confirmed to possess some unwelcome technical quirks (like wanting Resizable BAR on at all times), and ultimately released with merely decent-ish performance. Nothing awful, but nowhere near as special as they once seemed like they could be.
In 2023, however, Intel Arc may be on a redemption... arc. A series of driver updates, Intel claims, have improved average FPS performance by up to 87% since launch, with major gains in frame times (the time between each new rendered frame) as well. The specific model we have here, the Arc A750 Limited Edition, has also had its price cut from £330 / $289 to  £250 / $250. More power for less money? I’d say that’s worth a fresh evaluation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Outlast Trials, the third entry in the popular horror franchise, will welcome players into its twisted world when it enters PC Early Access on May 18. 
A new trailer reveals the news in a rather unique fashion, showcasing voice performers recording the horrific screams, yells, and grunts that will unnerve players in the game. The game was first announced in 2019, and developer Red Barrels gave players their first hands-on sample of the game via a closed beta last October. The ETA for the full release remains shrouded in mystery, however. 


The Outlast Trials mixes up the formula of the previous entries by letting you play alongside friends in four-player co-op (although you can still play solo). The game unfolds in a secret facility during the Cold War, with players controlling involuntary test subjects being tortured in gruesome experiments. Avoiding enemies instead of confronting them remains the key the survival, though you obtain and upgrade tools that can increase your odds at staying hidden or slowing foes down. 
You can check out The Outlast Trials in early access on Steam and The Epic Store.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sons Of The Forest has been a big success - so popular it may have crashed Steam - but players have had some quibbles about the survival sequel since its early access launch. Developer Endnight Games are looking to fix many of these problems, and add a bunch of new features, in the newest patch. Yesterday’s patch added a mid-game boss, a bucket of balance tweaks, multiple fixes for everyone’s absolute best friend Kelvin, plus much more. You can read the full list of changes in the developer’s Steam blog.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fatal Frame: Mask Of The Lunar Eclipse plunges players into the dreadful past of Rougetsu Island as three (Young women? Girls? I have no idea how old they are supposed to be and for some reason that’s not surprising.) survivors and a stalwart detective revisit the ruins of a hospital that was once home to a haunting ceremony. They all have amnesia, of course, because that’s a low-effort way to generate an air of mystery. Well, except the detective, who is just confused because he never really figured out what was going on in the first place. 
Overall, it’s a thoroughly okay game from 2008 that’s been papered over with some hazy lofi graphics to justify selling it at full price in 2023. It’s up to you if you think that’s worth it – I bought the Mass Effect remaster, so I’m hardly one to judge – but while the graphics have been thoroughly airbrushed, that’s no cure for Fatal Frame’s dated gameplay and undead pacing.

Capcom announced the news during their Spotlight livestream, where they showcased many upcoming games including Resident Evil 4’s remake and its brand-new demo.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Exoprimal reared its scaly head during today’s Capcom Spotlight, revealing a new trailer delving into the game’s bonkers plot and a reveal of a July 14 release date.
A new trailer reveals the game centers on a time-loop, as a team of soldiers travel to the past and find themselves reliving the same day. Dinosaurs have also begun appearing all over the globe through mysterious wormholes, so our heroes strap into their weaponized exosuits to deal with that very strange problem. 


As a cooperative team-based multiplayer game, Exoprimal is an always-online experience and will feature season passes with a number of unlockable rewards, such as cosmetics. Those itching to try the game early can jump into a free open beta that runs March 17 to 19, but you'll need to register for a Capcom ID to play. Exoprimal will be available on PlayStation and Xbox consoles and PC. It will also launch on Xbox Game Pass.]]></summary>

Movie, Nintendo, Illumination, and Universal have released one final trailer to try and catch prospective audience members' attention. The final trailer came by way of a livestreamed Nintendo Direct featuring the main cast (including Chris Pratt, Charlie Day, Keegan Michael-Key, Seth Rogen, Anya Taylor-Joy, and Jack Black), as well as directors Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic.
The trailer gives us a more in-depth look at the Mario Kart sequences, which take place on the iconic Rainbow Road course. Along the way, we get Easter eggs, including side-scrolling sequences, shortcuts in Mario Kart courses, and even nods to Bob-omb Battlefield and Tostarena. To coincide with the release of this new trailer (which you can view below), we received a new synopsis of The Super Mario Bros. Movie.
Jurassic World and The LEGO Movie franchises) and brother Luigi (Charlie Day; It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia) are transported down a mysterious pipe and wander into a magical new world. But when the brothers are separated, Mario embarks on an epic quest to find Luigi.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During today's Nacon Connect presentation, developer Teyon showed off new gameplay of the upcoming RoboCop: Rogue City. The game puts you in the metallic shoes of Alex Murphy as you explore Detroit in what appears to be a high-octane, technologically advanced first-person shooter.
RoboCop: Rogue City not only gives you the tech-enhanced combat capabilities of the eponymous protagonist but also gives you the ability to make dialogue choices as you meet new characters. This lets you decide how to fulfill your objectives, but as you might have guessed, the developers intend to throw various twists in a story about corruption and greed. Actor Peter Weller, who portrayed Murphy in the original films, is scheduled to reprise his role in the game.
You can see the action unfold for yourself below.


Developer Teyon was founded in 2006 and has released nearly 100 games since. Its most noteworthy releases include other licensed titles starring '80s action IP, including 2014's Rambo: The Video Game and 2019's Terminator: Resistance. RoboCop: Rogue City arrives in September for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.]]></summary>

Previously, Epic had their own internal curation process for publishing to the store, but this changes from today, with developers now having much more control over getting their games onto the EGS.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I really enjoyed the first Figment when it released back in 2017. An action-platformer with a musical theatre twist using the human mind as its stage? Very creative! Bedtime Studios’ follow-up Figment 2: Creed Valley keeps very close to the beat of the first one. You don’t need to have played Figment 1 to enjoy this sequel, but I almost feel like you’d be missing you if you didn’t (especially as it’s free on Steam right now, for today only).
Figment 2 has all the visual flair and catchy sing-songs of the first, but it feels weirdly smaller. Both games will run you about 5 hours each, but Figment 2 is a little less punchy, a little less diverse, and feels more like an encore rather than a dazzling comeback album. That’s not necessarily bad; I love an encore, and I enjoyed seeing more of Figment's surreal, subconscious mind-world. But, yeah, it’s very much the same as the first game, but with less scope and fewer fart clouds.

You'll have to listen to find out). In games we seem to accept that a series running for decades, over many, many sequels, is just kind of normal. What's the deal with that? Would games be better without sequels? Who knows? Us. We do. We talk about it today.

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2023/03/09/resident-evil-4s-rain-will-be-adjusted-in-day-one-patch"/>
        <updated>2023-03-09T15:59:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As part of our Resident Evil 4 cover story last month, we showed off a slice of Chapter 5 gameplay in which some fans called out the heavy rain effects for being too intense and distracting. Capcom has heard those complaints and plans on changing the rain to make it more palatable. 
In an interview with Press Start Australia (thanks IGN), the outlet asked RE4 producer Hirabayashi Yoshiaki if the team was aware of the negative response to the rain, and he had this to say: 
“We’ve seen everyone’s reaction to the rain effects, and we are working on a day-one patch to make adjustments”
So there it is. It looks like “raingate” will soon be a thing of the past, and it’s nice that Capcom recognized the complaints ahead of Resident Evil 4’s release.  
Resident Evil 4 launches on March 24 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PC. To learn more, be sure to visit our cover story hub for a month’s worth of exclusive features.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wild Hearts gets its first free content updates this month in the form of new Kemono (the game’s term for monsters), quests, and more. Players won’t have to wait long because the first DLC hits tomorrow, March 10. 
On Friday, the Deeply Volatile Kemono Set adds the Hellfire Laharback creature for players to hunt alongside an accompanying quest and a new skill. On March 23, the Subspecies Kemeno Pack goes live, which introduces the wolf-like Grimstalker plus a new quest and new weapon/armor model. This update also adds more higher-difficulty quests, three new emotes, and three chat stamps.
Koei Tecmo also confirmed in a Twitter thread that the first update includes unspecified technical fixes too, and plans to share more specifics tomorrow. A tease for April’s DLC offerings teases new Kemeno, Karakuri, and other updates.
Looks like Wild Hearts fans will have plenty to keep them busy in the immediate future, and the (hopefully) performance improvements, whatever they may be, are a welcomed bonus. To learn more about Wild Hearts, you can read our review here.]]></summary>

Here's hoping it will also be available on PC, and not just PlayStation this time.

An intergalactic radar, in fact, because this is a hospital management game - in spaaaaace! - coming later this year. It's from a Brighton-based indie studio called Brightrock Games, and it sort of looks like Theme Hospital with a space skin, or Startopia with a hospital sim. Neither option is a bad thing, in my opinion.

And that's coming from someone who recently reviewed Team Ninja's Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty, a game that's mighty good at grinding people into paste. I'm not trying brag; I'm being vulnerable with you. I have a case of the Ben Affleck blues, where most sessions of Clash's third-person action-adventuring have me veering from elation to being slumped against a wall with Affleck's signature grimace on my face.
Aside from being really difficult, I'm a bit undecided on how I feel about Clash in the portions I've played so far. It looks fantastic and puts some brilliant spins on combat, but levelling is a bore and exploration has a confusing edge. It's at once both a grand time and an annoying one. The surreal lands of Zenozoik, it turns out, aren't all sunshine and turkey men. There are a lot of turkey men, though.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Crucial MX500 is one of the best gaming SSDs in the SATA category in my books, right alongside the legendary Samsung 870 Evo. That's because the SSD offers excellent performance while working within the confines of the SATA interface, with straightforward TLC NAND flash and a DRAM-equipped design that ensures strong sustained performance - something lacking in QLC DRAM-less designs. 
Today, the Crucial MX500 in its 2TB capacity is down to $102.99 at Amazon US, making it nearly 50% off its MSRP and the lowest price we've ever recorded.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new firmware update hitting the PlayStation 5 today will add Discord voice chat along with other fan-requested features.
The update allows users to link their Discord and PSN accounts to chat with friends through the app. Xbox received the same support last summer, so we’re happy to see it appear on another major platform. You can read more about how to get Discord up and running by visiting the PlayStation Blog. 
Additionally, the update introduces variable refresh rate support for 1440p, allowing smoother visuals for VRR-compatible HDMI 2.1 displays at 1440p resolution. The game library now filters PSVR and PSVR 2 titles. Data transfer between different PS5 consoles has also been added, and PS4-to-PS5 save data transfer has been significantly streamlined. Be sure to visit the PlayStation Blog for the complete rundown of what the update has to offer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As promised last year, Halo Infinite’s season 3 update has arrived with a new ray tracing option for us PC folks. Although it was announced as part of a promo event for AMD’s Radeon RX 7000 GPUs, Infinite’s ray tracing works on any graphics card that can usually handle RT effects; all you need to do is download the update and flick it on in the display settings.
Granted, it’s not the most visually sumptuous form of ray tracing I’ve clapped a visor on. Reflections and global illumination are unchanged, as it’s only sun shadows – shadows cast using a simulated sun as the light source – that get the RT treatment.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Starfield, Bethesda's mammoth-sized space RPG, is launching on September 6, the publisher announced in a video today. Additionally, a presentation showcasing more of the game called Starfield Direct will air on June 11. 
In a new video hosted by game director Todd Howard, he states the Direct in June – which happens to be the weekend before E3 starts – will provide a "deep dive" into the game. He reiterates that Starfield is a unique experience that also has many of the hallmarks fans expect from a Bethesda title. We last saw Starfield during the Xbox Game Showcase last summer, where Bethesda revealed its extensive scope, including thousands of planets, spaceship construction, environmental scanning, and other features. 


Starfield was originally slated to launch on November 11, 2022, before getting delayed. It was later reconfirmed to launch within the first half of 2023, and though September sits on the second half of the calendar, we're happy to see the game get a concrete date again. 
Starfield will be available on Xbox Series X/S and PC and will also launch day one on Xbox Game Pass.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Publisher Chucklefish announced Wargroove 2 today, a sequel to its well-received Advance Wars-inspired strategy RPG. 
Developed by Robotality, Wargroove 2 is set three years after the first game, with a new faction looking to use ancient technology to conquer the now-peaceful land of Aurenia. The main story unfolds across three interconnected campaigns set on land, the sea, and the sky and features a new cast of commanders. It also features a new roguelike campaign called Conquest that tasks players to complete a series of smaller battles while making permanent choices and relying on the same pool of units, health, and resources. 


Wargroove 2 features four-player co-op and versus battles (local and online) along with rule customization and asynchronous play. An in-game editor allows players to create custom maps, campaigns, and even cutscenes to share with other players. 
The first Wargroove was lauded as a fun throwback to Advance Wars when it launched in 2019, so we’re excited to see what Chucklefish has in store for the follow-up. Wargroove 2 doesn’t have a release window, but it’s slated to launch on Switch and PC. You can read out review of the first game here.]]></summary>

And I was like, "wait, so until you turned up to they just eat each other? How do they have a sustainable population? What's going on here?"
Thus, in a spirit of pure scientific enquiry, I booted up Sons Of The Forest and immediately discovered that everyone has been lying to me, because Sons Of The Forest is not a survival game. Sons Of The Forest is very clearly an early 00s b-movie action thriller. The script was left in a filing cabinet in Slough in an empty office until the office was repurposed into a call centre, at which point it was found by a middle-manager whose paintball team thought it was awesome, and somehow he sent it to a game developer by mistake. This is what happened, and you cannot convince me otherwise.

I've spent some time with the closed beta, poking and prodding at the game's live service cogs to determine whether it's running a smooth operation or a clunky one that may not be worth your time.
And you know what? The game took me by surprise. So far, it's a decent time that's perhaps more along the lines of a Destiny, than say, World Of Warcraft. I genuinely believe it could garner a big community and have a bright future ahead of it - but when it comes to such a saturated space, I worry that Wayfinder may struggle to stand out, and won't attract players who are done with the usual rise 'n grind demands of these sorts of games.

Until this week, it had never been localized for North America, but starting March 9, it will be available on just about every platform with improved visuals and a new photo mode. Fatal Frame is a game all about fighting ghosts in haunted locations with a magic camera, but this will be the first time you can pause the game and take pictures in the contemporary "photo mode" way we are all now familiar with.
This episode of New Gameplay Today ended up being a long one, making it feel a bit closer to our Super Replay series where Marcus Stewart and myself have been playing classic horror games like Dino Crisis and Silent Hill. I promise we do encounter some ghosts, though – you just need to be patient.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Upcoming farm-o-life sim game Before The Green Moon has an interesting setting: a small community round the base of a space elevator, set in the lead-up to you leaving for the moon. Even more interesting is that it's coming from Turnfollow, an indie team best known for wonderful little story games like Little Party and Wide Ocean Big Jacket. Huh! Life sims are not my genre but I really like Turnfollow's games, so I'm in. Check out the announcement trailer below for a small taste of this sci-fi life.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Grand Theft Auto publisher Take-Two have confirmed layoffs at the company, primarily affecting their corporate and publishing efforts. The news originally spilled yesterday via a Tweet from Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier, who claimed the cuts would impact Private Division - the publishing label behind The Outer Worlds and Kerbal Space Program 2 - and other unnamed divisions. Take-Two later confirmed the news in a statement to PC Gamer, saying the layoffs would affect “corporate operations and label publishing.” Take-Two haven’t clarified the number of employees that have been laid off, but the cuts to development teams would be “minimal.”

Anyone who makes or writes music knows that the path to a complete track isn’t a linear one. It’s a process where instruments weave in and out of the composition on the whim of the person making it. And even when the vision is clear, and you know exactly where you want to take the song, be it behind a drum set, a keyboard, a loop track, or even a computer, things can get in the way. Rytmos, developer Floppy Club’s first non-mobile game, nails that feeling. It uses puzzles to extract the joy, escalation, triumphs, and trials of making music, and it does so with g…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Riot Games announced last month that three League of Legends games would arrive this year, including The Mageseeker: A League of Legends story. Now, the company has announced that The Mageseeker will hit consoles and PC next month. 
More specifically, The Mageseeker will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on April 18. It will cost $29.99 on digital storefronts, and preorders include the Lost Silverwing in-game bonus. You can also purchase the Digital Deluxe Edition for $39.99, and it includes additional digital items like a Silverwing Supply Station Pack, Home Sweet Home cave decorations, exclusive spells, and Unchained skins. 
Check out the game in action in the new trailer below: 


"Developed by Digital Sun, creators of Moonlighter, the Mageseeker is a gritty 2D hi-bit pixel action RPG, set in Demacia, a mighty kingdom in the world of Runeterra that seeks to curtail what it deems as forbidden magic while wielding magic themselves to maintain order," a press release reads. "Play as Sylas, an escaped mage who joins a band of rebels in the deep forest. Their revolution will shatter Damcai's deceptive peace – a peace built with the blood and sweat of mages. The Mageseeker provides an action-packed fantasy gameplay experience for those looking to experience a story of power, identity, and justice." 
Riot Games also revealed today that it is selling a physical Collector's Edition of the game for $169.99. It includes a Sylas statue, an art book, a deluxe art print, the Lux Comic (special edition hardcover), Sylas & Lux enamel pins, and a vinyl soundtrack. All of this comes housed within an exclusive custom box. 

The Mageseeker follows the release of 2021's League of Legends Story game, Ruined King. Check out our thoughts on that in the Game Informer's Ruined King: A League of Legends Story review. The other two games Riot Games plans to release this year are Song of Nunu and Convergence.

Ridiculous, maybe, but these paranoid questions run through my head as Yu climbs a mountain. No safety gear. No helmet. Just his own hands, sneakers, and determination. I have to follow soon after, and though I’m undoubtedly scared, in the moment, I’m much more afraid of killing the creator of Spelunky than my own mortality. Though you could argue, in this hyper-specific example, the game should’ve been a cautionary tale. In Spelunky, you do die a lot. Nevertheless, I don’t want to be responsible for the death of one of the game industry’s most beloved indie developers.

But there is one bit of connective tissue, namely that charging into the fray is generally a bad idea. In the case of the game, that's because The Light Brigade is VR roguelike, one that blends Souls-like dark fantasy with World War II-era weaponry, with you playing a spiritually immortal but physically fragile warrior responsible for saving the world.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[JBL are well known for their speakers and other audio products, so it's not really a surprise that their Quantum series of gaming headsets tend to offer pretty excellent sound, with an apparent focus on immersion and simulated surround. What is a surprise is that the company's Quantum 600 wireless headset is down to $59.99 on Woot, a nice $90 reduction from its current Amazon price of $149.99.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Happy birthday, anniversary, launchiversary, or whatever you want to call it to the Steam Deck. Valve’s handheld SteamOS games machine has successfully evaded hardware flop status, currently sitting fourth in Steam’s own top sellers list a full year after it began shipping. That’s well deserved, too: the Steam Deck was a fun little alternative way to play PC games when it released, and through a combination of added features, ongoing improvements to game compatibility, and simply a wider choice of great games, it’s a better device now than it’s ever been.


I was originally going to look back on the Steam Deck’s first 12 months with my eyes only, but what fun is a party of one? Thus I invited Valve designer Lawrence Yang and engineer Pierre-Loup Griffais for their takes on the Deck’s past, present, and future.

The Barcelona, Spain-based studio, which was founded in 2014, will end development on all of its projects as a result of closing its doors in April, as reported by Gematsu. The studio cites unfavorable "economic context" as the reason it's shutting down after nine years of development, primarily creating 2016's Aragami, its Nightfall DLC, and 2021's Aragami 2. 
Here's the studio's statement on its closing, in full:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer The Outsiders has announced the first piece of premium DLC for its critically acclaimed rhythm-based shooter, Metal: Hellsinger. The game, which challenges you to blast the demons of Hell to the beat of an original soundtrack featuring some of the biggest names in metal, is adding two new original songs to the soundtrack through the first piece of downloadable content.
The DLC, Dream of the Beast, adds original songs from two singers who didn't appear on the main game's soundtrack. Cristina Scabbia from Lacuna Coil and Will Ramos from Lorna Shore join the cast of recognizable singers to contribute to the soundtrack. Dream of the Beast also adds The Red Right Hand, a new machine gun, and three new outfits, each of which provide unique gameplay modifiers.
These updates join the game as part of the Dream of the Beast DLC, but players who don't purchase the premium content also have something to be excited for. The same day the DLC arrives, players can expect a free title update for Metal Hellsinger. This free update adds a new song selection feature.
Both of these updates arrive on March 29 on all platforms. The game, which took home Game Informer's "Best Shooter" award for 2022, is available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. For more on Metal: Hellsinger, check out our review here.

That sounds straightforward, but this dispute is a lot more complex than that.

In the case of new town builder Outlanders, I'd have to share a house with five other people, the farmer just died of old age, and my leader wanders around doing nothing while occasionally issuing edicts forcing me to have children. But at least there's a chance of pumpkin pie.

Despite my love for large-scale simulation games like Cities: Skylines as an adult, I was not a SimCity player growing up. Instead, I was pulled in the direction of the more manageable SimTown. The zoomed-in town management, where you can micromanage every aspect of your citizens' lives without the massive scope of SimCity, always appealed to me more. Perhaps that's why Outlanders, a simplistic yet challenging settlement builder, has now sunk its hooks into me on two occasions across both of its platforms.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Puma has unveiled a new shoe collection inspired by the popular MMORPG, Final Fantasy XIV. 
The collaboration will consist of four shoes: two Puma Slipstream models and two RS-X models, as reported by Techraptor. For each model type, there's a (Warrior of) Light version and a Dark version, which basically equates to white and blue-green, and black and purple-pink. All four of the shoes look great but before you get too attached, these shoes are Japan-only for now. There's no word on if they'll come to the U.S. 
Check out the shoes in the gallery below: 

Each of these shoes will cost 17,050 yen, which is roughly $125, according to Techraptor. They will be released in Japan next week on March 15. 
Shoes inspired by video games have risen in popularity, with Converse releasing two sets of Pokémon-inspired shoes last year. Perhaps more than any other shoe maker, though, Puma has been steadily releasing video game shoes. In 2018, it released a pair of sneakers based on Sonic the Hedgehog's iconic red shoes and then in 2020, Puma released a line of Super Mario All-Stars shoes. Puma announced some NBA 2K21 shoes in 2021 and then just two months later, the company revealed an Animal Crossing: New Horizons line of sneakers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As I have complained about mightily in the past, I grew up somwhere that didn't have much in the way of entertainment, so me and my friends had to engage in the time honoured tradition of making our own fun. Once we reached about age 17 this included playing poker with a shared second-hand chip set, and trying to do beer centurions (the progress in the latter affecting our interest in the former). I was never any good at it because, though poker was a fixture for several years, I was never really able to learn the rules. What hand is good? Why has your hand beaten his hand? But the little pictures are the best, I don't understand! It's disappointing because understanding poker is a cool adult thing, plus not understanding it makes certain pivotal scenes in James Bond films quite hard to parse.
Last week we got an email (shout out Aidan) singing the praises of Aces And Adventures, and I do try to check out recommendations from readers, even if I don't have time to reply or to write about the games. In this case I've made a special because Aces And Adventures is a great game that is teaching me winning poker hands through the medium of a dwarven warrior smashing things.

What's especially notable about this trailer is the animation style, which is quite unique for both the TMNT franchise and animation in general. It's reminiscent of stop-motion mixed in with the comic-style vibes of Spider-Man: Into The Spiderverse, although it's also very much its own thing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dead Cells is one of the best roguelites I've ever played and was one of the standout games in the very crowded 2018. However, its success is only possible through standing on the shoulders of the giants that trailblazed the genre. Of all the franchises Dead Cells drew inspiration from, perhaps no series was as influential as Castlevania. Because of this, the crossover between the two, which comes in the form of premium DLC for Dead Cells called Return to Castlevania, is a natural fit that not only resurrects Konami's dormant franchise but gives a nostalgic shot in the arm to one of the best roguelites available today.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bandai Namco has revealed a new Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi game. 
Yesterday, the publisher released a short teaser trailer for the game, running less than a minute, that highlights footage from previous Budokai Tenkaichi games before showcasing what appears to be the new one. In the footage of the new game, we see Goku powering up. And then the words, "Get Ready For Battle" and "A New Sparking Begins" appear on screen. 
Check it out in the Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi teaser trailer for yourself below:

「ドラゴンボール Sparking！」シリーズ
#ドラゴンボール #バトルアワー pic.twitter.com/VMMPWWeSUr
March 5, 2023
As you can see, the game might be called, in some variation, Dragon Ball Sparking (that's what the tweet calls it if you use Twitter's built-in translate function, too). But regardless, the trailer ends with "A New Budokai Tenkaichi" begins, quelling any doubt that this is a new game in the series that has laid dormant for 16 years. Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi 3 was released in 2007.  
The teaser trailer doesn't indicate if this is Budokai Tenkaichi 4 or something else but it's exciting nonetheless to see that Bandai Namco hasn't forgotten about the series. It is somewhat surprising to see this announcement, though, considering Dragon Ball FighterZ exists. Budokai Tenkaichi is a fighting game series as well but to see a new one before a sequel to FighterZ, which was released in 2018, is something I imagine not many people could have predicted.

        <updated>2023-03-03T18:51:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yosuke Matsuda, president and representative director of Square Enix, is stepping down after 10 years in the position. 
The official announcement states that he’ll be replaced by the relatively new Takahashi Kiryu, a company director who joined Square in 2020, as part of an organizational restructuring. The proposed change will be voted for approval at the 43rd Annual Shareholder’s Meeting in June. Square Enix’s reason for the change is as follows:
Matsuda became president in 2013, succeeding Yoichi Wada as part of a massive restructuring. His time at the top could be viewed as a bit of a rollercoaster. He pushed for innovation in Square’s flagship franchise, Final Fantasy, and voiced commitment to remaking and re-releasing popular titles from Square’s back catalog, such as Final Fantasy VII. The MMO Final Fantasy XIV also became a global phenomenon under his watch, though the company as a whole has largely struggled to land a massive success outside of the franchise. In recent years, high-profile Square Enix-published titles such as Marvel’s Avengers and Babylon’s Fall had disappoitning releases, with the former ceasing development this year and the latter shutting down this week. 
Perhaps most infamously, Matsuda was also at the front of Square’s tumultuous relationships with its North American third-party publishers, namely Crystal Dynamics and Eidos Montreal, whose titles such as the Tomb Raider reboot trilogy, Deus Ex, and Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy were often deemed commercial disappointments. That came to a head last May, when Square Enix sold off these studios and their IPs to Embracer Group.
In recent times, Matsuda was also a vocal advocate for NFTs and blockchain gaming. In January, he published a letter detailing upcoming company initiatives, including making games that incorporate blockchain technology.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Pokémon Company has released a new teaser trailer for its upcoming Pokémon reboot. 
The Pokémon Company revealed back in December that the long-running Pokémon anime starring Ash Ketchum and his Pikachu would be coming to an end soon, set to be replaced by a new Pokémon anime with two new protagonists. The Pokémon Company has released a new trailer that reveals these two new main characters are Loko, "the girl with the awe-inspiring pendant," and Roy, "the boy with the mysterious Poké Ball." Plus, we get another look at Friede, who is the Professor of this anime, alongside Captain Pikachu.

The trailer above also reveals that this new Pokémon anime will debut in Japan with an hour-long special on April 14. As for the rest of the world, the release remains unknown but the trailer does say 2023 and beyond so hopefully sometime this year. 
Here's another look at the three characters introduced in today's trailer: 

Strangely, this trailer wasn't released during the Pokémon Day showcase, which aired earlier this week. There, The Pokémon Company announced a new stop-motion animation series coming to Netflix, Pokémon Scarlet and Violet DLC, a re-reveal of Pokémon Sleep, and more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo has revealed that Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscribers can jump into Metroid Fusion when the game is added to the NSO library on March 8. 
After surprise releasing Metroid Prime Remastered last month, Metroid fans have another game from the series' history to play through, this time in the Game Boy Advance game first released in 2002. Once Fusion is live with NSO, players can finally experience Samus Aran's full 2D series journey on the Nintendo Switch, starting with the original Metroid game all the way through Metroid Fusion and 2021's Metroid Dread. 
Check out the Metroid Fusion Nintendo Switch Online trailer announcing the news below: 


"In Metroid Fusion, interstellar bounty hunter Samus Aran is attacked by an X parasite while exploring the mysterious planet SR388," Nintendo's description of the game reads. "This organism is not only deadly, but it can mimic the abilities of any creature it infects – including Samus herself! Saved from the brink thanks to an infusion of Metroid DNA, the X parasite's only natural predator, she soon discovers that the parasite has spread to the research station orbiting SR388. Weakened and out of options, Samus must do whatever it takes to destroy the X threat before it's too late." 
Nintendo says Metroid Fusion contains "a multitude of secrets" for players to experience that links Super Metroid to Metroid Dread. 
Speaking of Metroid Dread, read Game Informer's review of it to find out why it was one of our favorite games of 2021, and then read Game Informer's Metroid Prime Remastered review. Check out our list of every NES, SNES, Game Boy, N64, Sega Genesis, and GBA game on Nintendo Switch Online after that. 
Metroid Fusion hits Nintendo Switch Online next week on March 8.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This year our project was accepted to the Google Summer of Code program for the eighth year in a row (and 16th time in total).
The intention of the program is to bring new contributors to open source projects, and the eligibility rules for participants are the same as last year, with both students and non-students welcome to participate. Check the  Google Summer of Code website for details of eligibility.
Participants can apply for either short tasks (about 175 hours) or long tasks (about 350 hours). The coding period typically runs from the start of June to the end of August, but there is some flexibility and the participants can opt to use a longer coding period if they are not available to work full time on the project during the summer.
ScummVM is looking for applicants! A list of suggested projects can be found on this page, but we’re open to your own ideas too. Please make sure you provide the required information in your application before submitting. We also strongly encourage you to join our Discord server and follow the #scummvm-gsoc channel where you can engage with our mentors and the rest of the team, and get advice and help on getting started with the project and writing your application.
We have gathered some information to guide you, based on our previous 15 years of experience in the program. You may start your exploration from our Google Summer of Code miniportal.
We are looking forward to your application and participation!
