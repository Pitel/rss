Inspired by the upcoming Rush mode, EA Sports has given a sneak peek of what's to expect in the near future. The official pitch notes have shared vital information about the new season and what to expect for the rewards. We already knew that the new set of rewards will feature items that will be useable in different modes, and Season 1 seems to be designed around the Rush mode.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Destiny 2's newest Episode, Echoes, has brought with it a lot of weapons people have been focused on. The Aberrant Action sidearm, Lost Signal grenade launcher, and Martyr's Retribution grenade launcher are three great examples of that. While getting the new weapons is the most exciting, however, some older weapons are still hefty powerhouses. Here's how to get the Indebted Kindness sidearm in Destiny 2.


Where to get the Indebted Kindness in Destiny 2

The Indebted Kindness is available as a drop from the Warlord's Ruin dungeon, released with the Lightfall Dungeon Key. If you don't yet have it, it can be purchased from the Eververse store for 2,000 Silver. Unlike a lot of weapons, however, Indebted Kindness can drop from any of the three main encounters of the dungeon. This means your most effective method of farming will be to simply complete the dungeon on all three of your characters each week. Since you seemingly can't craft the weapon, you'll need to trust in RNG to give you the right roll.


Indebted Kindness god roll


If you're farming for the best roll on the Indebted Kindness, you'll want the following setup:



Launcher Barrel: Volatile Launch


Magazine: Tactical Mag


Perk 1: Lead from Gold


Perk 2: Voltshot



Volatile Launch gives a much better blast radius to each of your shots, at the cost of projectile speed and handling. Tactical Mag, meanwhile, gives better stability, reload speed, and magazine size at seemingly no downside. Lead from Gold is great for getting some of that precious special ammo back when picking up heavy bricks. Finally we have Voltshot, which causes your shots to jolt when reloading after a kill. It's one of the best perks in the game right now, so it's a must-have here.

About 1.5 years later, Poppy Playtime Chapter 3: Deep Sleep came to PC via Steam as well, tasking players switch exploring a decrepit orphanage under the toy factory known as the Playcare. Of course, the new haunted environment features new puzzles, monsters, and a massive orphanage to explore in the biggest Poppy Playtime environment yet.

Where to find every Cameo Bot in Astro Bot


There are seven zones stuffed to the brim with levels of the regular and hidden varieties, each containing 300 known bots. Five extra bots also appear, with one being hidden in a secret level requiring 300 bots and four hidden in Astro's Play Room. I've marked the four from Astro's Play Room with asterisks so you won't be pulling out your hair, like I did, wondering why you never found Lady Maria.

I was a latecomer to the Splatoon series. If you had asked me three years ago what my favourite Turf War stage is, the 45 minutes I had spent with Splatoon 2 might have been able to cough up "the boat one" at a push, but that's only if I was really firing on all cylinders. The Inklings freaked me out, the motion controls made me dizzy, and it was all too fast for my little brain to handle. But then Splatoon 3 came along and stole my heart.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In theory, vampires and immersive sims go together as naturally as bats and caves. Immersive sims tend to involve a balance of stealth, acrobatics, raw strength and crafty manipulation, and vampires are celebrated for all of these things. Despite this, actual vampire-themed immersive sims are rare. My list starts with Vampire: the Masquerade: Bloodlines... and sort of ends there. In a devastating betrayal, Arkane Austin's Redfall wasn't an immersive sim but an open world co-op shooter (a not very good one). The much-delayed Bloodlines 2 was recently downgraded from immersive sim to RPG by new developers The Chinese Room. Arkane Lyon's Blade adaptation seems promising, but it's a ways off. 


Here to paper over the immersive vamping gap in the market is Byte Barrel's Trust, "a new first-person shooter with immersive sim elements". It takes place in a world where the vampires are hunted for their blood, which has become an everyday human energy source, used for everything from car batteries to streetlights. The irony! I feel like, in the circumstances, the ideal solution would be for humans to let vampires suck their blood in return for vampires letting humans use their blood for electricity, but that wouldn't make for a very thrilling shooter. Anyway, here's the trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Secret units are among the most sought-after characters, as many consider them the best in the raid business. But, due to their mysterious nature and rare odds, they can be challenging to unlock. We'll show you how to get the new secret Golden Boy in Anime Defenders Update 6.


How to unlock Golden Boy in Anime Defenders


You can get Golden Boy using the Golden Knight Portal (Secret). To obtain this portal, you must first go through the proper channels with the lower tiers, including Rare, Epic, Legendary, and Mythic Golden Knight Portals. Start with the Underwater City Infinite mode to acquire Rare and Epic drops. Then, you'll have the opportunity to enter the higher tiers.


Use a Portal Hardener to increase your chances and drop another portal of the same rarity. It should help you in your quest to acquire the Mythic Golden Knight Portal. Once you've earned this, you'll have a 2.5 percent chance for the Secret reward. Find it in your inventory and press 'Start' to embark on the challenge.

Survive and defeat enemies to conquer the waves, earning you the new secret unit for Anime Defenders Update 6. Golden Boy includes a Passive skill that inflicts a Burn effect, dealing five percent damage for five seconds. He also offers a vast range of AoE, which can be expanded with upgrades.


Anime Defenders Golden Boy evolution


To evolve Golden Boy in Anime Defenders, obtain the Primordial Gem. Craft it with the following items:



30,000 gold


5 Golden Emperor (Retrieved)


20 Phoenix Feather


10 Radiant Guardian (Retrieved)


7 Star Rift (Green)


7 Star Rift (Red)


3 Star Rift (Rainbow)



Participate in the Golden Knight Portal challenges to earn these various rewards. It'll take a lot of grinding to gain the entire collection, but fortunately, Golden Boy's robust powers can help out in a pinch.

The bit that might be surprising, instead, is that Saber Interactive may be working on even more content than we know of.


This information comes from an impromptu Q&A held by the game's creative director, Oliver Hollis-Leick, over on Twitter. According to him, there absolutely will be narrative additions to Space Marine 2, whereas up until now we only really knew about what was coming as part of the game's first year of post-launch content. Broadly, the season pass focuses exclusively on cosmetics, while the "Battle Plan" for year one also references free PvE additions via Operations, Horde Mode, and so on.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cancel your social obligations; the second season of Castlevania Nocturne is scheduled to arrive on Netflix on January 2025. This continues the story of Richter Belmont and his gang of monster mashers.


According to the description for the trailer: “Now joined by the legendary Alucard, Richter Belmont and his band of vampire hunters are in a desperate race against time. Erzsebet Báthory, the Vampire Messiah, who already seems invincible, seeks the full power of the goddess Sekhmet so she can plunge the world into endless darkness and terror.”


I haven’t watched the first season of Castlevania Nocturne because I didn’t finish the first Castlevania series. Which is weird, because I’m a massive fan of the Castlevania games. Well, it’s not so weird. I don’t watch much TV. I play video games, and I write. I did watch the first season and then part of the second, but I never made it to the end. Hm. I probably should.


Anyway, from the looks of the trailer, we’re not in Symphony of the Night territory yet. In fact, it would seem that Dracula has yet to make an appearance. Maybe the showrunners are shaking things up and trying to prove that Dracula isn’t necessary to tell a good Castlevania story. It’s happened a few times in the games. Technically. But also, I already said I didn’t watch the first season of Castlevania Nocturne, so don’t listen to what I say. Well, aside from the date of the second season. That’s based on information from Netflix, so you’re not relying on me for that one.


Castlevania Nocturne season 2 will be released sometime in January 2025.

Netflix has announced that Season 2 of Castlevania: Nocturne will premiere in January 2025.
This news comes via a brand-new trailer (thanks, Gizmodo) which gives us a tantalising glimpse at what we can expect to see from the acclaimed animated adaptation. Crucially, it looks like legendary characters Richter Belmont and Alucard will be teaming up to take down Erzsebet Báthory in what seems to be a very loose take on Symphony of the Night. Alucard, of course, cropped up at the end of Season 1, so if you've not watched it yet, then get on it.

Like many games these days, it features a battle pass system where you can snag rewards as you advance through the tiers. Here's the interesting part: the battle pass is tied to your overall rating (OVR). The higher your OVR, the more tiers you unlock in the season pass.

The Season Pass has two tiers: Free and Premium, and it starts at 20 OVR and goes all the way up to 100 OVR.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As you might have heard, Flappy Bird, the once-in-a-lifetime mobile game hit from a decade ago, will somehow make a comeback in 2025. Flappy Bird's creator Dong Nguyen recently took to Twitter to assure everyone he has nothing to do with the "revival", and to show his distaste for it with the simplicity and discretion we've grown to expect out of him.




When someone speaks out against the use of their creation — and whether or not they're in the right — money is usually a part of the issue. If there's one thing we know about Dong Nguyen, however, is that he doesn't put money above his integrity.


Long story-short, Flappy Bird originally became the most popular game in the mobile gaming world overnight. Out of nowhere, nobody could unglue their eyes from a game that was equal parts simple, challenging, and pointless. 


Nguyen found himself making tens of thousands of dollars a day, but that didn't make him feel good about the whole thing. The pressure and notion that he was responsible for something that had people wasting so much of their time took a toll on Nguyen and led him to pull the game from stores, not even a full year after its release.




The news of Flappy Bird's revival is baffling for many reasons. Nu-Flappy Bird isn't the result of Nguyen coming up with a cool idea for a follow-up to the original game. 


It came about when a dubious company named "Flappy Bird Foundation" acquired the rights, after they seemingly went up for grabs. The game will, unsurprisingly, have a bunch of microprogression features that nobody is very keen on. Moreover, Flappy Bird never really left, as dozens of clones and variations have always been available to the public.


The new version is, at best, something that Nguyen wants nothing to do with. Also, does anybody even still care about Flappy Bird?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Perfectly plucky.
After years of waiting, The Plucky Squire finally launches on Switch tomorrow, 17th September 2024. And to celebrate, publisher Devolver Digital has released a launch trailer which captures the game's aesthetic and charm perfectly.
The trailer shows us the world of Mojo in papercraft dioramas, all created by Julia Yus and Yeray Pérez Vallejo. The delightful scenes are incredibly detailed with the art style matching the game's 2D sections perfectly. Even the scene transitions are paper.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Iron Studio has released an update for Pacific Drive that should help anyone who felt the Olympic Exclusion Zone was a bit too unfriendly. The “Drive Your Way” update adds a slew of difficulty settings to fine-tune your experience, along with some other goodies.


Difficulty settings are always a good thing. Personally, I like playing at the default or mid-range settings (yes, even when reviewing a game), but I’m not going to fault someone for picking “I’m too young to die.” At the same time, if you’re a “Nightmare” sort of person, then you can also lift the difficulty for a harder experience.


I’ll give you the list of difficulty options, and then I’ll talk some more about what else is in the patch. Here they are:

Survivor's latest performance update sadly fails to resolve this problem.


To be perfectly clear, now, Jedi: Survivor's Update 9 is a proper game-changer if you'd excuse the pun. We're seeing a substantial increase in the game's frame rate basically across the board as well as losing the much-maligned Denuvo anti-tamper. Yet, thorough testing conducted by Overclock3D and my own personal experience show that Respawn has failed to resolve Jedi: Survivor's traversal stutter. To that end, the stutter-struggle sadly continues, and I've got little hope that it's going to be fix…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's surprise news for EA FC 25 players ahead of early access, as EA Sports has announced an official gameplay stream for the upcoming title.


While you'll need to wait till Friday before trying out all the new content firsthand, you can get an early glimpse of what to expect. EA Sports will be going live on the game's official YouTube channel to reveal different content to viewers. Let's take a look at all critical information relevant to the stream.


EA FC 25 first gameplay stream date


The first official gameplay stream will be taking place on September 18. This is exactly two days ahead of when early access begins on PC and consoles. This stream will be vastly different from the deep dive presentations conducted earlier by EA Sports. The stream is also going to be the first instance when the mass audience will be able to view all the content inside the game, including the new Rush mode.




EA FC 25 first gameplay stream timings


Here are the official timings of the gameplay stream as revealed by EA Sports.



8 a.m. PST


11 a.m. EST


4 p.m. BST



Incidentally, EA Sports has followed a similar schedule for the earlier deep dive presentations as well. The deep dive presentations tended to be between five and ten minutes, but the official stream is expected to be longer. As of writing, EA Sports hasn't indicated the duration of the stream.


How to watch EA FC 25's first gameplay stream?


The first gameplay stream will be showcased live on the game's official YouTube channel. You can check it out by clicking here, and make sure to put on a reminder lest you forget the date and time.


Interestingly, EA Sports has used an image of the five icon stars and mentioned in the tweet that there would be special guests. There's a chance that we might be able to watch the cover stars play the game in person. So far, EA Sports has remained tight-lipped about the exact content of the stream.

Hot on the heels of last week's Super Mario Bros. Wonder bundle in Australia, Nintendo has announced two new Switch bundles which include Mario Kart 8: Deluxe and 12 months of Nintendo Switch Online Individual Membership.
Due out early this fall — so probably sometime next month — the bundles will include a digital download code for Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, the aforementioned 12 Months of NSO, and either an OLED or a regular Switch model. The Booster Course Pass DLC is not included. (We originally stated that the DLC was not confirmed, though the box states that it includes 'Full Game Download', not mentioning DLC. We've updated the wording here to reflect this)

You're constantly repairing corroded doors and swapping out busted engine parts with cobbled-together technology. But maybe this tinkering was a little too much. Our review praised the game for its "trunk loads of atmosphere" but called the constant need to craft stuff "laborious". If you also felt this, then good news. An update now lets you fiddle the difficulty options a generous amount, say developers Ironwood Studios, making the game easier and bringing crafting needs right down.
Buuut... if you thought the opposite - that the game wasn't hard enough - you can now tick a box that makes hitting yourself with the trunk door kill you stone dead.

It's "a compact and high-density Metroidvania, with a focus on sequence-breaking and playing things out of order". It uses a square aspect display ratio calibrated to give wizened Game Boy enthusiasts the shakes, and is made up of 200 single-screen rooms that "slot into the larger puzzle-box of the world". Also, you play a thorn witch who looks a bit like 1950s Tinkerbell, with a touch of Betty Boop. Here's a trailer.

The latest update for the physics-based open world build-a-car game introduces a mountable theodolite, which lets you stitch together monorail networks you can then ride about on.
If monorails strike you as frivolous, don't worry. It's more of a Shelbyville idea. And in any case, the theodolite also lets you construct networks of pipes, power lines and rail-less tarmac roads - the ready-salted crisp of the road family. It’s a chonky expansion that, in the words of lead developer Ian MacLarty, has only “scratched the surface of where this new system could go”. I am predicting an eventual pivot into either themepark management or factory simulator.

Twenty hours ago I placed my first manufacturer somewhere around here. Back then it represented the state of the art, hatching me a pristine batch of 1.25 computers every minute - now I’ve forgotten where I put the damn thing, after delving into my factory’s guts to hook that piddly yet still useful batch of old relics up to my main production line. I’m building supercomputers now, and the many manufacturers that make those are hungry.
Something is always hungry in Satisfactory, and that hunger pulls you from task to task in a near-seamless and frankly beautiful daze of ever-escalating industry. It is mesmerising and it is fearsome, and after five years of early access it’s finally complete.

Well, the joke's on you, squirrels, because I used to play grass hockey as a kid and I've been hit in the head by hard round objects a million times over. How else do you explain my choice of career?

Checked for new codes! 




Slimes might seem small and easy to kill, but in Slime Slaying Simulator, you're faced with killing so many in a world packed with them that they'll become the bane of your existence. In these vast worlds, fighting slimes is a noble cause for which you're handsomely rewarded. 


While the game's name might make you think of a cheap knock-off Dragon Quest title, this Roblox game is far from it. In Slime Slaying Simulator, you're taught the basics and then are sent out into the world to kill slimes, earn new gear, and unlock new parts of the world so you can conquer the Slime Queen and many more monstrous enemies.

Well, we thought this might be the case. After a weekend of splatting in the Grand Festival, Nintendo has announced that Splatoon 3's "regular updates" will come to an end.
The announcement tweet was quick to clarify that just because this is the end, it doesn't mean it's the end. While we might not be seeing any more regular updates to the game, seasonal events like Splatoween, Frosty Fest, Spring Fest, and Summer Nights will still be popping up with some returning themes and Big Run, Eggstra Work, and Monthly Challenges are sticking around "for the time being" too.

Since releasing back in 2016, Stellaris has nine core expansions, a single narrative expansion (Astral Planes), and about a dozen content packs including story-specific content and new playable species. The newest expansion, Stellaris: Cosmic Storms, adds new dynamic Cosmic Storms that affect gameplay, a new Origin, Storm Chasers, 3 new Civics, and some new technologies built around the new storm mechanic. Through and through, it's more Stellaris, which is always a good thing.

In Fox's last update on Deltarune Chapters 3 and 4, he explained how the game would go on sale once Deltarune Chapter 4 was complete. While the blog post he's shared explains how all of his work on developing both of these Chapters is done, they're not finished and ready to go on sale just yet. He anticipates that Deltarune Chapter 3 will be ready for proper testing by mid-October and that he'll know more about where Deltarune Chapter 4 sits in the next update blog he posts.

You'll meet all sorts of wonderful characters and get to experience puzzles themed around stories in more ways than you might first expect. 


When I first saw The Plucky Squire, I thought it was a platformer that took place entirely within a storybook's pages. I really did think it was a 2D game, but I was pleasantly surprised when I saw that the gameplay has so much more depth and enters the realms of 3D space for its puzzles and story. It's a game indie fans won't want to miss, and it pays to know exactly when it's going to be released. So you can clear your schedule and enjoy everything the game has to offer in one go.

In reality, they were being taken away due to a criminal complaint filed by Hollywood, Canal+, Apple, Amazon, and other rightsholders. Since then, the owners of Uptobox have turned to the legal system, hoping to salvage whatever they can. On Thursday, a Paris court informed the defendants that their servers will not be returned.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A classic, continued.
It’s fair to say that Gimmick! 2 was a sequel not on many people’s bingo cards before its surprise announcement in June 2024. Its 1992 predecessor, a retro gem and Sunsoft’s take on a mascot platformer, enjoys a cult reputation as one of the rarest games for the Famicom/NES owing to its limited release in Japan and, oddly enough, Sweden.
It certainly made an impression on Gothenburg-based Bitwave Games, the studio behind 2022’s Gimmick! Special Edition — a rerelease of the notoriously difficult original for modern consoles — and its unlikely sequel.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As written about early in the year, future Intel CPUs will be moving past the "Family 6" identification used since the mid-1990s with the P6 micro-architecture. Since then Intel has continued releasing new CPUs under "Family 6" with different model IDs while AMD has been more open to changing its Family ID every Zen generation or two. With Intel using Family 6 for so long it led to a lot of Linux kernel code just relying on Model ID comparisons for determining between Intel CPU generations and the like. Thus a lot of Intel CPU model handling reworks are needed for preparing future Intel CPU generations that will no longer be in Family 6. With Linux 6.12 it looks like that work will be wrapping up...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In V Rising, you're a fledgling vampire on a mission to become absolute bossferatu of a Gothic open world. You get a Diablo-ish combat system, the ability to shapeshift into a spider, and a whole castle to prance around in, crooning at the moon. I like this premise almost as much as I dislike the fact that V Rising is also a survival game, in which you must fell trees and master a crafting system like a common turnip farmer.


What do we hope for when our interest in a game is almost perfectly balanced by our disinterest? We hope that the developers will treat us to a free-to-play weekend, in which our perhaps-unfounded reservations might be strategically offset by the endorphin rush of not having paid any goddamn money. This, V Rising creators Stunlock have now done. The game is free to download and play on Steam from right now until Monday, 16th September at 5pm UK or 10am PST.

Despite being on our radar since its announcement last year, we have seen remarkably little of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleashed, the upcoming 3D platformer / brawler from developer A Heartful of Games and publisher Outright Games. That is until today! An all-new gameplay trailer has arrived to kick some shell and things are still looking pretty good.
Building on the first gameplay glimpse we got in July, today's new footage starts to introduce us to the game's story (as narrated by one April O'Neil). A bunch of baddie mutants are on the loose — in a Turtles game? What are the odds?? — and it's up to the heroes in a half-shell to shut them down. We can see combat aplenty and some of the basic platforming challenges too, in what appears to be both single-player and co-op modes.

It's also just been Major Updated, with new two player cooperative local and online multiplayer, various quality-of-life tweaks, new recording functionality, and a suite of gameplay changes or fixes to make Larian's eyes water.

Whitethorn Games and North Star Video Games have only come out with a rival: Spray Paint Simulator. In it, you get out your spray painter and "shshshshshs" different colours of paint onto various surfaces. For whatever reason, the universe this takes place in doesn't seem to value brushes or those rolly mops. "No", it says, kicking your brush into the sun. "Spray or nay".

The order comes in response to a complaint from the National Publishers Union (SNE), but the victory may be bittersweet. Many of the listed domain names were previously seized by U.S. authorities, and expanding the current order could prove time-consuming.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A European consumer advocacy group have published an open letter to the European Union Commission expressing their concerns about video games that make use of premium in-game currencies - aka, make-believe money you can buy with real money, such as Minecoins in Minecraft's Bedrock Edition. 


The group in question are the Bureau Européen des Unions de Consommateurs, or BEUC, who represent 44 non-governmental consumer organisations from 31 countries, and have been around since 1962. They're accusing the publishers of Fortnite, EA Sports FC 24, Minecraft, Clash of Clans and others of misleading people -  specifically children - with their in-game premium currencies, and breaching European Union consumer protection laws. On a press site that summarises the results of various longer studies, they offer the below broad complaints about the practice.

It is Diddy Kong Racing but all the courses are water slides. It's Cool Runnings but there are 40 penguins instead of four Jamaicans. Okay, that last one is a bit of a stretch. But basically, yes, this brightly coloured free-to-play knockout racer feels like that one Super Mario 64 level where you race the big penguin down a slide, only this time there are a ton of other players trying to beat you to the secret shortcut. It's coming out next week.

My humble contribution is 50/50, a downloadable or browser-based game which I suspect will fill some of you with the deepest aggravation. As the name suggests, it's about cutting things in half - specifically food items, such as fried eggs (easy enough) and candy canes (WTF). You draw a line down each object with your mouse, then click or hit space bar to perform a slice. Then, the game calculates a percentage.  If it's bang-on or very close to 50/50, you'll pass. If not, you'll have to start over. I know: this is how entire days are wasted. Sorry.

The resignations came in the wake of a dispute between Annapurna Interactive president Nathan Gary and Annapurna studio head Megan Ellison. As Bloomberg report, negotiations were taking place to "spin off the video-game division as an independent entity." After failing to reach an agreement, Ellison pulled out of the negotiations, resulting in the resignation of Gary and “other executives.” Further resignations followed, with a reported two dozen other staff leaving the company.

The Mesoamerican pixelart landscapes, for example - radiant, cloud-hung platters of land with people and buildings reduced to daubs of paint in the foreground. The fact that it's about witnessing and surviving colonial invasion, rather than the more familiar European or North American video game fantasy of searching a New World for plunder.
The ensemble storytelling, with four, successively playable characters setting their own lenses to thickly entangled themes of sorrow, vengeance and growing understanding. The sparse, expressive dialogue, each phrase carefully tucked inside its speech bubble. The music. And the little things at the level of how you move, what you do. When you pick a faraway destination on your map, your character makes the journey screen by screen, which gives you a second to lean back and be a passenger, watching the horizon, at least until you're ambushed by a giant beetle.

Mere weeks from release after years of delays, plopped in front of me at a cramped, lightly vibrating Gamescom booth, and you still won’t reveal your secrets. I did get to play a brief whizz through GSC Game World’s eerie FPS – enough to feel encouraged, even – but be it time constraints or the darkness of my nighttime raid into the radioactive Zone, I would have liked to have quite literally seen more.
Then again, keeping the mystery intact may have been the point all along. "As a game director, I want to hide everything from the player", GSC’s CEO Ievgen Grygorovych had told me minutes earlier. "I'm fighting with the marketing team because they want to show as much as possible!"

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hollowbody’s introduction is masterful, and not just for a sallow skyline that captures the life-sapping dreariness of British coastlines. The horror nous required to impart unease in the middle of the day are somewhat eased up on when you’ve got all that serotonin-begone drizzle to work with, sure. But this feels more poignant than that. There’s a soulful drearines and utterly heartbreaking inevitability to the vibe here, as your character and rubber suited activist pals try to get the bottom of a horrific incident. It’s got best British indie horror film of the year written all over it.

Either way, Frontier are hoping to cater for all humankind's quirky day-out desires with Planet Coaster 2, by adding water slides and wave pools to the teacups and train rides of their management sim. I had a short go on it, and while there's no chance two hours of hands-on time could give me a full impression of the building game's suite of creative tools, I was quietly pleased with the jungle-themed pool I nestled into the earth. And with the little shark mascot I hired to patrol it.

Eve Frontier was previously known as Project Awakening and is set in a faraway sector of the Eve universe. The developer calls it "a sandbox which focuses on self-reliance, skill-based tactical gameplay and third-party development". Huh? Third party development? Oh, I see. It has a bunch of blockchain cryptocurrency horseshit attached to it. Great.

According to a leaked memo, Microsoft are laying off around 650 people "to organize our business for long term success". This is the same Microsoft that parted with around 1900 employees in January, and the same Microsoft that washed their hands of around 10,000 staff in January 2023, all in the name of shoring up the business for future prosperity. That "long term success" is certainly taking its sweet time. Or at least, it is if you're one of the poor saps in the trenches of, in this case, "corporate and supporting functions".

I've never been able to perform it consistently. It's one of many moderately fiddly special attacks - written down for posterity in a tear-stained journal I keep sorrowfully beneath my pillow - which have walled me out of enjoying fighting games, much as I love thinking about them. 


That wall grows ever higher as I age and my digits turn to dust and my dreams of launching Ryu like a sack of potatoes fade into the twilight. Still, at least I can still play and have fun with shooters, right? All you have to do in shooters is press a button once to make stuff go boom. Wait, Nightmare Operator, what are you doing?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Better check those desert dunes again Caravan SandWitch, someone’s buried the lede. An open world you can explore in a few relaxed evenings? One that favours the joyous freeform sightseeing of an Elden Ring or Breath Of The Wild; where you’ll scramble up vast industrial concrete ruins on scavenging missions for inquisitive frogs, instead of being nagged by bothersome checklists?
Ok, rain check on that last point. SandWitch can’t help but eventually funnel the freedom of ambling around in your chuffy yellow van into restrictive collect-a-thons. Still, for much of its breezy runtime, this one’s a real panacea for gaming’s more bloated map-scourers. Plus, even when you are sent off to hamster-cheek scavenged components before making progress, there’s very little in this world that doesn’t feel intentional. Sidequests and storytelling crumbs are deliberately scattered throughout, and each building is a thoughtful concrete puzzle box. It is, in brief, a nice time.
You play as Sauge, a spacefarer returned to her planet of Cigalo after receiving a distress signal from her missing sister. Cigalo’s a cheery place, though economically and environmentally devastated after being exploited by an evil spacecorp named The Consortium. It’s populated by small settlements of people, some large talking frogs named the Reinetos, and the occasional friendly robot. Everything’s friendly, as it goes - even gravity itself. There’s no danger, no death, no damage from flinging yourself off the tallest building you can find. Just helping out your desert buds, upgrading your van with more gadgets to solve puzzles, or working on finding exactly where Sauge’s sister has go to.

Each person on the account will have one of two roles: adult or child. Adults can manage parental controls, set hourly or daily playtime limits, approve purchase requests, and control store access. Valve appear very proud of making it easier for parents to spend money, streamlining the “time-consuming” task of buying games for their kids.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are cold opens and there are freezing ones. Sci-fi roguelike shooter Wild Bastards doesn't start on its strongest cowboy boot. You are dumped into the middle of an interstellar chase and summarily shown the ropes. The guns feel simplistic, the arenas bare, the loot vanilla, and the entire loop of beaming down to a planet and getting into small-scale "showdowns" threatens to become stale within the first hour or so. But then you find an outlaw buddy who offers a new way to shoot human dirtbags. Then another fellow bandit. And another. By the time your spaceship is half-filled with scoundrels and weirdoes shouting at each other, the game has warmed up enough to reveal its central idea. This ain't no grand FPS campaign, nor is it quick as roguelikes go. It's a snacky shootout sim with tumbleweed towns that feels best when you savour the pre-fight suspense.

Nic, I have no interesting ways to describe mushrooms right now. I used up all the mushroom lore I've ever gleaned from real-life foraging when I wrote about Morels 2, and I spent most of that article whining about unicorns. The best I can do as regards Shroom And Gloom is to say that these Shrooms do indeed look very Gloomy, possibly because some mad human has wandered into their warren and is now stabbing and eating them.

Whoa there, pardner, save a few subgenres for the rest of us! I think that's half the New & Trending keywords on Steam in one sentence. If you're mystified, best watch the announcement trailer - it paints a clearer picture, though it does involve a startling amount of cartoon decapitation and dismemberment.

If you had absolutely no trouble with this boss, I’m happy for you, as long as you go sit in the corner and keep it to yourself. For everyone else, you’ll be happy to learn the RPG's latest patch has “Improved the visibility of some attack effects” for the boss, alongside some other tweaks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you partake of some virtual rubber-burning, you might remember Ubisoft shuttered its open world racing game The Crew in March by turning off its servers. Given that The Crew is an online-only game, that signalled its death knell… or death horn, more accurately. Then in April, they tow-trucked the game out of people's libraries and revoked their purchases.

They're giving both an offline mode to "ensure long term access to both titles".

Whenever I visit family in the States and find myself in a derelict shopping plaza or some other place affected by America's depressing sense of architectural planning and overreliance on cars, I can't help but feel a sense of dread.
Devil's Hideout, a point and click horror game made by indie dev Cosmic Void, takes place in one such abandoned American city, and manages to deliver on this sense of dread even if its eerie hellscape is rough around the edges.

Pretty good, actually – perhaps not to the extent that you should tackle Space Marine 2 on a crusty notebook (or, for the record, a Steam Deck), but it runs decently on minimum specs and is noticeably more stable than in that preview. The only thing that might offend your PC’s machine spirit is some quality setting weirdness, where dropping or raising the graphics options can produce inconsistent results.

I like to walk in the woods around evening time, after a hard day of writing stupid listicles about Call Of Duty. Forests are a critical preoccupation of mine, actually - check this lumpen thinkypiece I wrote about Alan Wake 2 - but they're also spaces for retreat and reflection, where I can shrug off the angst and lose myself in the spectacle of sycamores and silverbirch, arching over the path.

That process begins with the speedy release of several fan reworkings of the trailer that use something like vanilla Minecraft graphics, rather than the original, unholy fusion of LB Photo Realism and Jack Black.

A modder has cracked open some previously disabled abilities in the official modding toolkit for Baldur's Gate 3, making it possible for folks to create their own levels or alter the game's existing environments. The toolkit (which was only made available last week) previously wouldn't let you do any of that, due to "technical constraints and platform-specific guidelines," according to developers Larian. But modders neither care nor sleep. It took them just two days to worm their way into the devkit's innards and make the impossible possible.

The Maw is ascendant during the darker months, its constellations growing visible to the naked eye. We will need a steady dosage of new PC games to keep it quiescent.

It features ship travel, combat, trade, and base building, and you can do all of it alone or with space mates. It’s got a demo, but it’s also on the cheaper end if you fancy buying into early access. Considering the pricing, I’d say it’s a real looker, too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A study published this week by researchers in Spain shows how the intent to subscribe to a streaming platform is affected when potential subscribers are presented with stimuli such as advertising-based discounts, loyalty-based discounts, and prosocial anti-piracy messages.

It's as though a toddler were actually an undersung class of special operator from a Tom Clancy shooter, rather than a wailing, hyperactive ball of tears and poop. Then again, I imagine Sam Fisher was a toddler once. Perhaps this is how he got started: escaping a smashed-up house full of roaming demon toys.

They've now published another blog post that torches the vagueness of the previous post with the righteously democratic flames of specificity. Overhauls to enemies are on the way, less-loved guns will be more effective, reworks to armor penetration and health values are on the boil, and they're taking inspiration from "player fantasies" for certain weapons and stratagems. All of these tweaks are set to go live on the 17th September, so not long to wait.

That was then and this, thankfully, is now. Byrne has tentatively returned to the project and begun sharing screens on social media.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Black & White was a god game that frustrated more often than it delighted, but which was nevertheless delivered with enough verve and ambition to be worth playing. It's a crying shame that it's not currently available to buy anywhere digitally, presumably because the rights are soaked in a gutter between EA (the original publisher) and Microsoft (who bought and closed developers Lionhead).

If you do still own a physical copy of Black & White however, you might be interested in Openblack. It's a fan-led project to create a modern, open source engine for running Black & White, and its first build was just released yesterday.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Every time you load up Agentia you are reincarnated as a different creature. "Creature" is perhaps too narrow a word - the game's "playable characters" range from geese, microscopic life and triceratops to menhirs and small rocky islands. Each forms the heart of a diamond of delicately drawn, isometric grid terrain with a baby mobile canopy of clouds and sun. It looks like an illustration from an old botanical or geographical textbook, although the inviting emptiness around the visible area also dimly reminds  me of certain elder RPGs I used to play on Macintosh.

Specifically, it did not forget about the incorrigible evil-doers amongst you who've been gunning for some additional plot catharsis. Larian's very bestest RPG has been biding its time in the shadows while you've been busy with other games. It has lingered silently while you've been off heisting on Tatooine or getting all messed up by Golden-Eyed Beasts, waiting and watching for the perfect moment - and now, it has finally struck with an unholy new patch, which adds 13 new Evil Endings, revamped splitscreen and an official modding toolkit. Foolish summer child! It is too late to flee.

I grab the faulty power transformer without listening, and am immediately electrocuted. Worse still, I have to hammer a quick-time button to recover.

Jerry is being tasked with repair work beyond his job description, learning the ins and outs of an escape pod's machinery from his co-worker via radio. This may come in handy, as the station is about to explode. Tin Can is not a new game (it came out in 2022) but it is on sale as part of Steam's space exploration fest.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Full disclosure: I hadn't heard of Bakeru until Graham mentioned it to me. Graham always has his hands on the video game pulse, gliding them over Xwitter or Steam or wherever and waiting for that "ker kun, ker kun" of a new Cool Thing. And that cool thing is Bakeru, described by its Steam page as "Japan-esque", but is in actual fact, very Japanese. I mean, you travel around 47 Japanese prefectures as a metamorphing tanuki who bashes evilness with his taiko drum sticks. Come on.
What I hadn't suspected was Bakeru's chops not only as a platformer, but as a means to increase your chances at success in pub quizzes. The game is a certified trivia Tardis, where you'll learn all sorts about Japanese culture as well as just like, the colour sepia being a genus of cuttlefish.

This is a fairly standard feature for a lot of blockbuster games, but in the world of Warhammer 40K there are so many mega-scale battles with pitch-perfect composition that I found it hard to resist hitting pause and taking a handful of snaps every few minutes. With a keen eye (and a beefy PC) you can capture some wonderfully violent moments.

They're claiming (via in-game broadcast) that the fleeting appearance of a weird purple blob on the map screen is actually the result of fluids leaking from the corpse of a long-dead comms technician, stranded on a server farm somewhere. Who to believe? Ah, if only we had some means of shedding light on the reports. Some way of Illuminating the situation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bear with me on this, but I adore how swordfighting works in Dune. Ubiquitous wearable sci-fi shields repel any attack that comes in too fast, so everyone has to learn this unique, overtly dance-like form of close-quarters combat where every thrust and parry is necessarily slow and considered. Picture it: careful judgments of your movements, weighing up the right time to strike, every measured jab part of a wider strategy that culminates in the kill.
MOBAs are like that. Both in the fights themselves, sort of, where probing lunges lead up to bursts of lethality, but more broadly in each match as a whole. They’re map-wide knife fights, where a thrust is a well-judged lane push and a parry a savvy item buy. At first, playing Smite 2 felt akin to watching on helplessly as my opponents repeatedly shoved their crysknives through my ribs. After 30 hours, it often still feels like that - but I am enjoying myself. Mostly. Despite Valve’s third-person elephant in the lane.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nikhil Murthy's Syphilisation is a "postcolonial 4X game", which might sound like a contradiction in terms. While approaches to 4X and grand strategy vary hugely between games, factions and players, the genre as a whole is firmly wedded to imperial conquest, both structurally and at the level of narrative aspects and set-dressing. Many 4X games are triumphal re-enactments of specific periods of colonial settlement and expansion. All of which is to say that Syphilisation is fascinating. It's a reworking of the genre which dismantles and reconstructs concepts such as diplomacy, research and production. It's also just left early access - find more details and a playthrough video below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been 13 years since the first Space Marine came out. While it wasn't outstanding in the grander landscape of gaming, enough Warhammer 40K fans seem to have cherished the escapades of bulky blue boltgunner Demetrian Titus for the action game to merit a sequel a decade later. It left its story on something of a cliffhanger, with said hero being dragged away to face untold tortures by the Inquisition, the most zealous sect of this preternaturally paranoid sci-fi universe. Today, Titus is free again. Free to stomp towards hordes of alien foes, blast them with a plasma incinerator, and shred the stragglers with a chainsaw sword. Space Marine 2 is an often-satisfying scrapper that has me  convinced of 40K's merit as a crafting ground for excellent-looking environments and creatures, even if I'm not particularly moved by the bland character of Titus and his fellow Ultramarines.
