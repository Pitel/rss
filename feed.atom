Hello one and all, and welcome to another edition of Box Art Brawl.
Before we check out this week's competitors, let's take a look at how we fared last time. We took a look at New Super Mario Bros. on the Nintendo DS, the first entry in the polarising platforming sub-series. It was actually a fairly close battle, but in the end, the North American variant featuring a giant Mario won out with 58% of the vote.

"Denuvo is no longer in Paday 3," they announced yesterday, ahead of its release on September 21st.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[More than the sum of its parts.
Summum Aeterna, a prequel to 2022’s Aeterna Noctis, riffs on a Dead Cells-style genre fusion, mixing roguelite elements into the tough Metroidvania structure of its predecessor for a game that doesn’t pull its punches. The result feels rough around the edges but it's hard to deny that the gameplay feels pretty great.
Enemies hit hard, frequently gang up on you, and will almost assuredly send you back to the hub dozens of times before you manage to successfully complete a run. And while Summum Aeterna primarily demands dexterous skills to overcome its toughest challenges, you do have something to show for each failed run. You, of course, lose most of the upgrades you snagged while out and about, but every run will see you gaining currency and crafting materials that you can then reinvest into things like better stats and starting weapons. This meta-progression system thus ensures that you’ll always be making progress, even when you lose time after time.

When I was working on my MFA in Game Design, I referenced Urbz: Sims in the City in a meeting with my thesis advisor, and he asked if I had played the console or the handheld version. I was confident that I’d played the console version growing up. I could recall the memory quite clearly—sitting against a study pillow on my childhood bed with the controller’s too-short cord pulled taut against the GameCube across the room, furiously speeding through the game in an attempt to finish every goal before Hollywood Video’s three-day rental period elapsed.
It’s hard to explain the cognitive dissonance I felt when my advisor started talking about in-game material that was completely unknown to me, that was certainly not what I remembered playing but had an eerie sameness to it, like the game I knew but in an alternate reality.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Another Another World.
Full Void, a narrative platforming puzzle game from London indie studio OutOfTheBit Ltd, wears its love of cinematic platformer classics on its sleeve. Bringing along core gameplay ideas from early entries in the genre, it mixes in some modern influences and introduces a few new ideas of its own.
You play as a hoody-up teen on the run, lugging a backpack with a computer in it as you trek through desolate cityscapes in knee-patched jeans. You are hunted by evil robot monsters, tracking you down with their menacing stop-light eyes and scuttling about on spidery legs. As atmospheric as it is, quite why this is happening takes a while to become clear. Nonetheless, the threat of your pursuers feels real and lends significance to the companionship of a small robot helper you encounter later in the game. Flashback cutscenes suggest this robot was developed by your mother before things went bad, bringing a satisfying element of vengeance to the story.

She'll carry the little felt balls around in her mouth and drop them in different places to explore new playpossibilities. In my slipper brings the fun of working in the dark. Beneath a chair makes for a great climbing frame ballsport straight out of a dystopian movie where a kickboxing freedom fighter (played by a muttering European) brings down The Man by being really, really good at batting a ball while dangling from a bar. Between two dumbells creates fun obstacles and windows of opportunity. And in the tangle of wires behind my PC brings the transgressive anti-authoritarian thrill of rolling around while being told "Baby no! Don't you...! Get out my wires!" Anyway, what are you playing this weekend? Here's what we're clicking on!

Following the apocalyptic events of Mortal Kombat 11 and its story-based expansion, Mortal Kombat 1 represents a new era for the franchise’s characters.

Mortal Kombat 1 brings the tight gameplay of its predecessors to the next level. Every punch, kick, throw, and special move feels impactful in the dances of death in which its characters participate. Once you get a fe…]]></summary>

Nintendo's latest entry in its Nintendo Switch Online-exclusive Battle-Royale-style series — which includes Tetris 99, the dearly departed Super Mario Bros. 35, and the soon-to-be dearly departed PAC-MAN 99 — returns a fan-favourite racer to a Nintendo console for the first entry since 2004's Japan-only F-Zero Climax.
F-Zero 99 takes all the high-octane Formula-Zero action of the original SNES game and adds online multiplayer with up to 99 players battling it out across a variety of racing modes. It's an addictive and complex game, and you'll need all your wits about you if you want to climb the ranks and make it to the podium.

Samsung is currently running a money-back promotion that brings this high-end PCIe 4.0 drive down to an attractively low price in both 1TB and 2TB varieties. 
You can get £30 back on the 2TB size, bringing the price to £94, while the 1TB size offers £20 back, resulting in a final price of £52. (This cashback offer runs until 9th October 2023, for the record; see their site for more info.) These are great deals and well worth considering if you want to upgrade your PC (or even PS5) with one of the fastest SSDs on the market.

It puts a bucket in front of you and asks if you think you can beat it. It's a question that's lingered every minute since.


I've been playing through Chrono Trigger for the first time, nigh-unspoiled on what makes this role-playing game such a legend in the genre. (So if you're scrolling down to the comments already, please be chill.) I've already been majorly impressed with how Squaresoft's team signals to the player that their actions, big and small, ripple out through the story.


So imagine my surprise when I've been brought to The End of Time, Chrono Trigger's equivalent of the archetypal RPG campfire, and there's a few anachronisms lingering aroun…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a Twitter post, General Manager of Diablo Rod Fergusson indicated that Diablo 4 Season 2, Season of Blood, has so much new stuff that two deep dive streams are already planned to cover it all. No dates for the streams have been revealed as of now, but it's a promising glimpse into the near future of Diablo 4.


Season 1, Season of the Malignant, has been pretty disappointing, to say the least. Sweeping nerfs hit the action RPG with the seasonal update, making the experience feel slower and less fun than the pre-season. To make things worse, the season itself doesn't have much meaningful new content.


If there's enough new content to justify two separate deep dive streams, it may be a bigger season than expected.


@RodFergusson on Twitter


What we know so far


Players were shocked to see Season of Blood revealed at Gamescom opening night, just over a month after the first season began. Thematically, the new season will focus on an army of ravenous vampires plaguing Sanctuary. Season 2 will feature a new quest line where you learn to hunt the hunter.


Gameplay-wise, the new season will add five endgame bosses as well as ways to target farm Uniques and Uber Uniques. Additionally, several quality-of-life enhancements are on the way. Renown rewards will now carry over to all characters, and gems will no longer take up inventory space. A revamp of elemental resistances as well as updates to several stats is also coming.


Blizzard plans to support Diablo 4 for a long time, so it's hard to say they need Season 2 to work out. However, after a disappointing first season, a better second season can show players it's heading in the right direction. Most ARPGs that are thriving now like Path of Exile took a few seasons to find their footing.


Diablo 4's Season 2, Season of Blood, officially begins on October 17 on all platforms. The current season, Season of the Malignant, will also come to an end on the same day.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Star Wars Jedi: Survivor is a fantastic game, largely due to the fact that it does such a good job of mimicking the Star Wars cinematic style. Whether it's the rush of stars streaking past a ship going into hyperspace or the distinct hum of a lightsaber, Respawn really went all out to match the aesthetic of one of the world's biggest movie franchises. One of the most important elements in achieving that is through music, and while the Star Wars sound is iconic and well-known, a good video game score has to be more than just an imitation of what came before. The music for Jedi: Survivor was written by Stephen Barton and Gordy Haab, and when I ask them what makes a good video game soundtrack, they answer in unison.

Note: NBA 2K24 does not allow you to take in-game screenshots on Switch. The images throughout this review were taken from the game's page on Nintendo's website.

Whenever September rolls around, you can expect a new entry in 2K's NBA series to bounce onto the court. These games aren't usually all that revolutionary, with a handful of new features and surprisingly good performance on Switch giving them enough to get by. We expected the same from NBA 2K24, but having got to grips with the latest title, the rinse-and-repeat formula is beginning to show its age, and purchasing the series annually has never been a less attractive prospect.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[yeo, the developer of such titles as The Friends of Ringo Ishikawa and Arrest of a Stone Buddha released their next game Fading Afternoon on September 14. 


Fading Afternoon is an RPG beat ‘em up following Seiji Maruyama, a member of the yakuza who has recently been released from prison. Per the game’s page on Steam, there are multiple endings, a variety of minigames, and an entire city to explore. Admittedly, yeo was sparse on the game’s details, but one sentence has this writer immediately intrigued: 


“Old tropes are here but you can choose to not follow them. The question is — does anything really matter that much now?”




yeo released The Friends of Ringo Ishikawa on May 17, 2018, and their second game Arrest of a Stone Buddha on February 27, 2020. A manga adaptation of Ringo Ishikawa was published later in 2020, on October 9. Fading Afternoon marks the developer’s return after more than three years.


Fading Afternoon will normally set you back $19.99, but if you buy before September 21, you can get it for $17.99, which represents a 10% discount. At the time of writing, the game has been received quite well, earning a “Very Positive” label just a day following its release.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Unexpected Studios has announced that their co-op furniture building game KallaX will release on PC September 18, 2023.


I don’t know why prefabricated furniture instructions sometimes tell you to work with a partner because building furniture together is one of the quickest ways to drive someone to desperate ends. When we moved a few years ago, my husband and I bought a lot of Ikea furniture, and it’s amazing that we’re still together. However, near the end of it, I was quietly assembling media centers by myself in the other room.




KallaX, for some reason, is attempting to replicate that experience endlessly in a co-op video game format. You play as little space men who must work together to gather parts and assemble furniture to ship out. It’s one part Overcooked and two parts malicious intent. It’s the whole experience: instructions, construction, and violent urges.


I usually bring these sorts of games to play with my parents and test their 40-some years of marriage. After all those years, my father has become an expert at annoying my mother, and it has never stopped being funny. Unfortunately, the current release is PC only. It’s a lot harder to gather people around my computer monitor, and while there are options to stream to my TV, I’m not lugging my PC to my parents’ house. Hopefully, a console port will follow, but for now, KallaX will have an online co-op if you feel comfortable playing with people outside the range of a good, motivating charlie horse.


KallaX releases for PC on September 18, 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lies of P is a dark fantasy soulslike that retells Pinocchio's story with a grim twist. It's replicating Bloodborne's vibe which not many other big-budget games have tried. The parallels are so blatant between the two that it almost comes as a detriment to the game.


What Bloodborne doesn't have is a hanging puppet with a sign reading "APAB" on it. Lies of P doesn't have one either now, as it was removed from the game before release.


The sign appeared in one image, referencing the saying "All Cops Are Bastards" or ACAB. It stands out so much that it caught the eye of videogames.si's Georgina Young, who interviewed Lies of P's director Ji-Won Choi about it.


Despite being such a small part of the game, Choi was happy to talk about it. He clarified that the sign stands for "All Puppets are Bastards" before jumping into its removal.


The sign's removal came down to not wanting to be "judged based on following trends," according to Choi. Lies of P had several other "risky factors" removed to not alienate players. 


If left in the final product, it could have echoed something like Deus Ex: Mankind Divided's "mechanical apartheid" which was seen as being in bad taste. Lies of P differs in that APAB never took a large role its marketing.


A part of me wonders if other in-game signs took real-life inspiration since the other signs had no elaboration. Puppets are the game's antagonists, and their depiction could have also taken more real-world inspiration at one point.


This hypothetical version of Lies of P and the sign are not in the final product. At least the game's message still appears to be that all puppets are bastards.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the things I like best about Die Gute Fabrik's forthcoming Saltsea Chronicles is an optional feature. It's a card game, Spoils, which you can play while sojourning upon the game's islands and searching for clues about your ship's missing captain, Maja. Here's how it works: two teams of two characters take turns to play cards, moving in clockwise around a table. Players must follow the lead player's suit, and the highest-scoring card wins the trick, with four tricks comprising a round. It might sound like a straightforward competition, but different islands offer different house rules, and there are twists that reflect the game's ethic of community, mutual respect and diversity, and help animate the detail of its gently post-apocalyptic oceanic world. 
The winning card from each trick is handed to the loser, so victory is, in its way, an act of generosity. Score more than 100 points in a round, meanwhile, and the "Hoarding" rule means you must relinquish those points to the other team. As Die Gute Fabrik's CEO and creative lead Hannah Nicklin observes, this fits the anti-capitalist politics and mythology of Saltsea, in which "hoarding is sort of seen as the apocryphal cause of the flood". The Spoils tutorial menus riff on this with a cute but mildly unsettling image of a sinking ship.

With two fantastic Spider-Man games under Insomniac’s belt, Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 feels like the culmination of the 2018 game and 2020’s Miles Morales in all the best ways. At a recent preview event, I spent roughly 90 minutes swinging and gliding across its new and improved New York City, taking down scores of bad guys and even challenging the Lizard. When my session concluded, I walked away thinking one thing: The first two games swung so that this third act could soar.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The demo for One More Level and 505 Games' first-person slasher, Ghostrunner 2, is now available. However, that's not the exciting bit about it. Instead, this particular shindig is a big deal because the demo features one of the game's big new gameplay hooks: a driveable motorcycle. While trailers have shown off this feature, it wasn't necessarily a given that it'd be available for players to check out in the demo. Especially since the game is due to launch soon, on October 26.


Ghostrunner 2's vehicular combat is already a bit of a point of contention in the community, however. On the game's subreddit, players have highlighted a wealth of bugs in the demo and a bit of indecisiveness as to whether One More Level did the right thing when it decided to include the bike. To that end, this demo may not jive all that well with all the fans of the original Ghostrunner.

Will Ghostrunner 2 pull combat bikes off?


The opinions on Ghostrunner 2's all-new bike are mixed so far, it would seem. While some players enjoy its speed and brutality, others are put off by their lack of control over the machine. If One More Level intended for the bike to be this game's wow feature, it might not pan out on this merit alone.


The good news, though, is that the demo itself shows that Ghostrunner 2 is a true-to-form sequel. Players should expect an ability rebalance and a slightly modified movement system, with a greater focus on having a coherent narrative and, according to the devs, more freedom in creating a character build. All great news for those who just wanted more of Ghostrunner, of course. But the bike itself may end up being a bit of an acquired taste for the community in general.


Ghostrunner 2 will launch on October 26 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.

Even that long-awaited PC release of Final Fantasy 16 can't quite compare to this, if you ask me, and I might even be more enthused by it than the prospect of a Switch 2. And I don't even really like Final Fantasy VII! That's how much Nomura's mad, timey-wimey game child has sunk its teeth into me. I'm mostly here just to see what mad nonsense comes Cloud's way next - and from the looks of things, it's a lot.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The sequel to 2018's highly acclaimed arcade racer Horizon Chase Turbo has officially launched on PC and the Nintendo Switch, though many might've missed this due to its Epic Games Store exclusivity. Indeed, the king of free game giveaways has scored yet another exclusivity deal, following a relatively long period of not going after them. The last high-profile Epic exclusive was Dead Island 2, discounting the variety of Ubisoft titles that are specifically avoiding Steam, but this time, it makes sense that it's happening.


Notably, Epic Games acquired the Horizon Chase developer, Aquiris, earlier in 2023. Given that he studio had previously released Horizon Chase 2 on mobile phones with plans to release it on the Switch and PC later on, it was rather easy to see the writing on the wall.

Fed up of waiting for a big publisher to revive a series that’s been lying dormant for decades?

Enter Bomb Rush Cyberfunk, as authentic a sequel to Jet Set Radio as you can get. Dripping with style and oozing cool, the team have crafted a carefully observed love letter that both respects and advances the original duology in meaningful ways, while taking a step back in others.

More specifically, the year 861 is when protagonist Basim Ibn Is'haq's journey begins in this city, the technological and cultural epicenter of the region at the time. After playing more than two hours of Assassin's Creed Mirage in developer Ubisoft Bordeaux's France-based office, I was impressed with its take on Baghdad. 
I love the open-world RPGs of the series' recent years, especially Assassin's Creed Origins and Odyssey, but I’d be lying if I said I was a fan of their respective cities. It's not that I didn't enjoy them, but they weren't memorable in the same way Assassin's Creed II’s Florence or Assassin's Creed Unity's Paris was.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Despite a couple of delays, Frictional Games finally released Amnesia: The Bunker in June, representing a return to form in the iconic Amnesia series. Now, get ready for an even tougher time in this WW1 setting, as an even tougher difficulty mode is on the way.


According to Creative Lead Fredrik Olsson (as spotted by Rock Paper Shotgun), the latest Amnesia game is getting a Halloween update, which includes a "shell shocked mode." This new difficulty will see the immersive sim horror game present an even greater challenge for players.




For starters, the admin office – where safety is pretty much a guarantee – will now have a wooden door instead of its usual metal barricade. This, presumably, means the stalking monster will be able to get to the player, thus assuring nowhere is safe.


Nope. Can't hide there, either.


At times of great stress, at least you can always count on the menu to pause the action, giving you a moment to rest. Not in the update. According to Olsson, time will not stop when you enter the menu screen.


What else? Oh yes. The update for Amnesia: The Bunker will also be introducing "new and randomized locations of corpses, dog tags and bunker rats."


And if just these features weren't enough, it also looks like the pistol – your one and only defense – is going to be stored in a locker. Therefore, you'll have to find a code for the padlock before you can get to it.


There doesn't appear to be an exact date for when this patch is going to start rolling out, so look out for it in the closing days of October. Suffice it to say, "shell shock mode" is going to sort the Amnesia wheat from the chaff.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Around the launch of the Xbox Series X/S, there were a few strange products from Xbox, including the Xbox fridge. The latest gimmick from the company is the Xbox Mastercard, which is equally as unexpected but may provide more practical uses. 


As explained in the blog post, the no annual fee Xbox Mastercard will allow you to earn points as you spend. The points can be spent on games and add-ons at xbox.com. For anyone enticed, take note that there are terms and conditions. The card is only available to customers in the continental United States, Alaska, and Hawaii from September 21. 


To sign up for the card, you'll have to be an Xbox Insider, which is simply a program where you can give feedback on the latest Xbox system updates, features, and games. If you don't want to join the program, you'll have to wait until 2024 when the card will be available to all players in the USA. 


Image via Xbox.


Why does the Xbox Mastercard exist


With a large Xbox logo on your credit card, you'll quickly let your cashier know exactly what kind of person they're dealing with. You'll also gain points when spending at the following places:



Microsoft - you earn 5x points on eligible products on the Microsoft store


Streaming - you earn 3x points on participating streaming services such as Netflix and Disney+


Delivery - you earn 3x points on participating dining delivery services such as GrubHub and DoorDash


Everyday purchases - earn 1x on everyday purchases



There are also some additional benefits that may appeal to anyone who spends a lot of time gaming. You'll get three months of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate after your first purchase if you're a new Game Pass member. There's also the option to personalize your card with your gamertag. 


It appears the Xbox Mastercard will find a cosy home alongside other quirky gaming products such as the Resident Evil 4 chainsaw controller and the luxurious Starfield chair.

The Trails series is known for its incredible worldbuilding through many different games, including Trails of Cold Steel, Trails from Zero, and Trails to Azure, as well as Trails in the Sky. The events of those games culminated with Trails into Reverie, which finally got a localized release this year.
The Legend of Nayuta: Boundless Trails, however, has absolutely no connection with the mainline games. That’s actually a good thing as it means Boundless Trails can implement new mechanics without being beholden to them. This has an engaging real-time action combat system with plenty of great worldbuilding through side quests. However, the story is rather simplistic and sometimes the platforming feels imprecise. Still, Boundless Trails is a worthy spin-off deserving of the Trails name.

It was one of the games that popularized dungeon crawlers and helped translate tabletop RPGs to the home computer. It’s not the first, however. Richard Garriot’s Akalabeth predates it by a year and DunjonQuest: Temple of Apshai by two. Even before that, there were attempts to recreate Dungeons and Dragons on mainframe computers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the opening section of Starfield, we're introduced to Vasco, the bulky robot that assists you on your quest to meet up with Constellation. Now, a figurine of the heavy-duty machine will soon be yours to own. But it's going to set you back a bit.


As spotted by GamesRadar, a company called PureArts that specializes in collectibles is launching its own line of Vasco figures. The Starfield companion is available to pre-order now, with a proposed release date of Q3, 2024.




The model itself is fully articulated and is a 1/6th representation of its video game counterpart. However, be prepared to fork over quite a bit as it's priced at $369. That does seem quite steep for a figure of a video game character.


Some more details


Images on the site, as well as the above video, show how much detail has gone into this replica of the Starfield NPC. As well as having 15 points of articulation, this Vasco keepsake has also been licensed by Bethesda, so it's a legit piece of memorabilia.


Some additional info:



Polyresin


Highly detailed painted sculpt


Fully articulated legs, arms, hands, and fingers


Scuffed paint and dented panels give a genuine in-game feel


Exclusive Item: "The Artifact" on a wood base



Basically, if you've been digging Starfield lately, and you're a fan of collectibles, this could be right up your alley. It is quite pricey, but its level of detail and the fact that it's been officially licensed may explain the cost. To some extent, at least.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just weeks following the launch of Immortals of Aveum, developer Ascendant Studios has laid off approximately 45% of its team, according to a report by Polygon’s Nicole Carpenter and testimony from some of the impacted employees. Ascendant CEO Bret Robbins explained the layoffs in a Twitter post as “a painfully difficult, but necessary decision that was not made lightly.”




It is unclear at press time what the specific reason for the layoffs is, though the Polygon report says a former Ascendant employee attributed them to Immortals of Aveum’s poor sales. Robbins doesn’t elaborate on that in the public statement, though he does say “we have to make this adjustment now that Immortals of Aveum has shipped.”


Immortals of Aveum launched on August 22 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series, and PC. The game was published by EA and marketed as an EA Original, but despite that, according to SteamDB, player totals haven’t exceeded 200 the entire month of September. It would seem the game could be a contender for worst selling game under the EA Originals branding, as stated by an anonymous former employee in the Polygon report.


Robbins, in his post on Twitter, confirms that Ascendent is “supporting those affected in every way we can, including comprehensive severance packages and job placement assistance,” and goes on to assure the current team, as well as those involved in these layoffs, that the studio will continue to support the development of the Immortals IP “with future updates and offers.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[They ain't pleased.
Unity recently announced plans to charge developers a fee each time a game utilising the Unity engine is installed via its new 'runtime fee' policy.
While there are caveats to the policy in terms of its structure (there are minimum revenue and total install numbers to consider, for example), there's no doubt that this will significantly impact studios upon its implementation from January 2024 (including, bizarrely enough, Nintendo - the 2021 Pokémon titles Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl were built by developer ILCA using the Unity engine).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The inexorable charms of Lil Gator Game are officially making their way to PlayStation and Xbox platforms. Playtonic Friends and developer MegaWobble confirmed plans for the ports, which will launch on October 10, 2023. Newly supported platforms include PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S. 


Those who pick up the PlayStation or Xbox versions will get access to the full game and the new content that dropped on Switch and Steam last month. That includes New Game+ mode, as well as the "baby mode" that's accessible from the main menu. 


An updated trailer is here for a refresher on the adventure game that emphasizes joyful exploration. The preview offers another look at the game's quaint action and playful sense of fun. 




A view to a chill


In addition to the main content, Playtonic provided details on the presentation of the ports. Lil Gator Game will run in 4k on PlayStation 4 Pro, PlayStation 5, Xbox One X, and Xbox Series X. It will be 1080p on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Xbox One S, and 1440p on Xbox Series S. All of the PlayStation and Xbox versions will also run at 60fps. 


With less than a month to go before the October 10 launch, the PlayStation and Xbox store pages are now live for Lil Gator Game. Those who long for bygone days of wide-eyed exploration and want an experience that goes light on pressure might find it to be a quiet delight.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[US author and artist Bill Willingham has rather dramatically announced that he is placing the Fables comicbook property in the public domain, including all Fables spin-offs and characters. This means that - pending a judgement from third-party legal experts, anyway - anyone can now create art of any kind set in the Fables universe. "What was once wholly owned by Bill Willingham is now owned by everyone, for all time," the author wrote on his Substack. "It's done, and as most experts will tell you, once done it cannot be undone. Take-backs are neither contemplated nor possible."


You might recognise Fables as the universe in which Telltale's The Wolf Among Us is set. It's a grubby noir fairytale world in which bedtime story characters like Snow White and Prince Charming live discreetly among regular humans, aka Mundies, having been driven from their homelands by a mysterious Adversary. I confess I've not read any of the original comics - I've only ever played the Telltale adaptation, which I enjoyed. I feel guilty about that in hindsight, because Willingham seems to have a pretty dim view of Telltale's work, though that's partly to do with what he considers to be his longstanding unfair treatment by Fables publisher DC Comics.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Riot Forge have been quietly building up quite the catalogue of League Of Legends side story games over the last couple of years. In November 2021, they launched the double whammy of rhythm runner Hextech Mayhem and turn-based RPG Ruined King, and this year alone we've already had action RPG The Mageseeker and narrative platformer Conv/rgence. As you can probably tell, they're all focused on different genres, different League heroes, and have all come from different developers - and soon they'll be joined by Song Of Nunu, the next game from Rime developers Tequila Works. 
I got to play a very small slice of it at Gamescom last month, and yep, if you've been craving another low stakes adventure that's all but guaranteed to wrench at your heartstrings and wibble your tear ducts, Song Of Nunu will almost certainly fill that Rime-shaped hole in your life when it comes to PC on November 1st.

To someone like Microsoft executive Sarah Bond, AI's prospects are exciting. She's the head of creator experience and ecosystem at Xbox, and in an interview with Inverse, Bond sheds light on where she believes gaming should go.


According to Bond, gaming is on the "precipice of a YouTube or SoundCloud moment" where technology will allow greater collective freedom. She refers to a future of "citizen creators," a democratized creation space further fueled by AI.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today's double-header of showcase streams has come to an end, as the September 2023 Sony State of Play just wrapped. It had some ups and downs, but certainly went out with a big closer.


Both today's Nintendo Direct and State of Play ended on remakes of beloved RPGs, which is pretty rad. In Sony's case, Square Enix brought out the big guns with Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, locking in a launch date for the second entry of its remake trilogy that really isn't too far off.




But let's not discount the other announcements, either. There's a surprising reveal of some DLC for Tales of Arise, some fresh looks at known games, and of course, virtual reality games. No State of Play is complete without some VR. Here's all the headlines.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During the September 2023 State of Play, we got a Release Date Announcement Trailer for Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth. At the end of the trailer we got a first look at the Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth Collector's Edition, and oh boy is it beautiful. Included is a 19-inch Sephiroth statue—in pure Sephiroth form, might I add—as well as a sick-looking steel book. Unfortunately, you're gonna have to shell out a lot of Gil for this one. The Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth Collector's Edition is priced at $349.99.




Materia(l) things


As per usual with Square Enix Collector's Editions, supplies are limited and only available through the Square Enix Store. Full contents include the Deluxe Edition of Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth, the Sephiroth statue, and the following DLC:



Moogle Trio Summoning Materia (DLC)

A summoning materia that can call "Moogle Trio" in the game.




Magic Pot Summoning Materia (DLC)

A summoning materia that can call "Magic Pot" in the game.




Accessory: Reclaimant Choker (DLC)

A choker with an effect of restoring HP when an enemy is defeated.




Armor: Orchid Bracelet (DLC)

A bracelet that gives courage to traverse an expanding world.




Armor: Midgar Bangle Mk. II (DLC)

A bracelet worn by travelers leaving Midgar.





As much as I want this, I don't think I can justify it. The statue looks decent quality, but certainly not price-of-a-console quality. But, for those who collect this stuff, I'm sure this is just what they were looking for. Still, it does feel like the price on these Collector's Editions continues to rise while the contents shift to mostly digital stuff.


For me it's all about the steelbook, which it appears actually comes with the Deluxe Edition which is priced at $99.99. That seems a bit more reasonable to me.


Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth releases exclusively on PlayStation 5 on February 29, 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Two years after launch, Tales of Arise is getting another slice of story. Tales of Arise - Beyond the Dawn looks to add more onto the tale of Dahna and Rena on November 9, 2023.


Shown during today's State of Play, the trailer shows the whole gang reuniting, one year after the events of the main game's story. Alphen looks to be taking care of a child that's on the run due to her lineage, and the crew gets wrapped up in the drama around it.




We can see the return of some familiar faces and locales in the trailer, as well as some new sights to see. In a press release, Bandai Namco says to expect over 20 hours of new game content with new quests, dungeons, boss fights, and a new story arc.


It sounds like there will also be a bit of a new start in this expansion. In a PlayStation Blog, producer Yusuke Tomizawa says that although Beyond the Dawn is a sequel to the main story, the team wanted all users to be ale to enjoy the game at "the appropriate level of design."



"In order to ensure this, a certain level of skills and other statuses are provided at the start, and we did not adopt a simple transfer of levels and statuses from the main game. Instead, we have prepared bonuses such as money and skill points based on the clear data of the main game, so we hope that you will enjoy the new story while taking advantage of these bonuses and developing the characters to your own liking."
- Yusuke Tomizawa, General Producer, Bandai Namco



Arise once more


Honestly, I really didn't see this one coming. I really liked Tales of Arise, and it seemed to get some newcomers into the Tales series in general too. Even though the original game wrapped up pretty neatly, I won't say no to more time with this team.


Tales of Arise - Beyond the Dawn is set to arrive on November 9 for PlayStation

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Put down that controller. Dr. Tom Tilley has shown us the way to play Puzzle Bobble (also known for years as Bust-A-Move in the West) as the Gods of Finger Dexterity intended: by using a salad spinner.


If you’re like me, you don’t put dirty plants in your mouth, so you might not know what a salad spinner is. My research suggests that it’s a device used to remove water from leafy vegetables after you wash them. It uses centrifugal force to separate the water and dry the leaves. This means that when you drown the salad in ranch dressing, the creamy sauce will stick to it.




To turn this device of vegetal torture into a controller, Dr. Tilley used some cardboard, an optical mouse, and an external button. Then, when the crank is turned, the mouse movement is read on the game. I’m not sure if this is a PC port of Puzzle Bobble I’m not aware of, or if he’s edited the input. That seems like it would be the hardest part of the process for me.


This isn’t the first Puzzle Bobble controller that Dr. Tilley has MacGyver’d together. Previously, he has created a similar contraption using a coffee grinder. He also got a little more constructive with some tubing. On top of this, he made a Katamari Damacy controller with an actual ball. It’s pretty creative stuff. Meanwhile, I can rarely be bothered to set up my racing wheel.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s almost time for Spider-Man 2, and it’s in that sentiment that Insomniac Games has revealed a brand new look at the game in today’s PlayStation State of Play. In this first look at how the sequel aims to evolve the open world concept, senior director Bryan Intihar showed off the game’s world, which has effectively doubled in size when you consider the inclusion of both Brooklyn and Queens. 




Players can now take advantage of the web-wings, which, when paired with traditional web-slinging, can completely change how they explore the game world. There will be more varied locales to check out with these new transportation mechanics, including Midtown High and Miles Morales’ very own Brooklyn Visions Academy. As players traverse New York fighting baddies left and right, they will be able to switch between Peter Parker and Miles Morales at will, and because of the PlayStation 5’s advanced hardware, the transition time is nearly nonexistent, according to Intihar.


Tied to the increased size of the overworld is the new district rewards system which will unlock a variety of rewards, including fast travel points, on the off chance players don’t feel like manually traveling. One feature that makes a return from past installments is the ability to customize appearance. According to Intihar, Spider-Man 2 will feature more than 65 different suits to pick from.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During the Sony State of Play, Square Enix announced its Splatoon-like multiplayer shooter Foamstars will host an open beta test at the end of this month, starting September 29.


The online paint war kicks off its Open Beta Party with two game modes, both pitting players against each other in chaotic arenas with teams of varying sizes. The Foamstars test run launches with two game modes, Smash the Star and Happy Bath Survival.


As for dates, Square Enix included a Foamstars open beta schedule adjusted based on timezone.



September 29, 6pm - October 1, 11:59pm PDT


September 30, 2am - October 2, 7:59am BST


September 30, 3am - October 2, 8:59am CET





In Smash the Star, you'll compete in a team deathmatch mode where the rules change as challengers are knocked out. Happy Bath Survival — what a name —whittles teams away into a last-team-standing affair.


If you choose to go all in earlier, your progress in the Foamstars open beta won't carry over to the game's full release. It's also only available for folks on PlayStation 5, though the multiplayer shooter will launch for the PS4, also. 


Today's State of Play ushered in a handful of new announcements, like a demo for Ghostrunner 2 out today and a look at Sony's new PlayStation controller offerings. However, Square Enix still stole the show with its update on Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, showing off brand-new footage and a fancy collector's edition featuring the series' best-conditioned baddie, Sephiroth.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As part of the September 14, 2023 State of Play, Sony has revealed the release date for the anticipated Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth. It will be releasing on PS5 February 29, 2024. Just a little under four years since the release of Final Fantasy VII: Remake.


The announcement comes with a new trailer that shows a nice mix of old and new. Vincent shows up, but we only see the back of his really epic mullet. We get a peak at Junon, which is looking pretty fly. Tifa also mentions weapons, the optional bosses from the original version. The Golden Saucer makes an appearance alongside Chocobo Racing.




Cloud rides around on a Segway while wearing a pastel-colored polo shirt. I don't remember that happening in the PS1 title, but my memory is more perforated than a tea bag. There's a bunch of other stuff that happens, but I don't want to say anything confidently in case I just imagined it.


It's some good stuff, nonetheless. I always felt that Final Fantasy VII got a lot of mileage out of its style, even when the story was sometimes a bit lacking. The remakes go a long way in preserving that while also making the world feel a bit more grounded.


Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth launches on PS5 on February 29, 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, during Sony's recent State of Play livestream, we got a look at both the upcoming PSVR2 update and story DLC for the Resident Evil 4 Remake. 
The VR trailer is brief but does show the game in action. Much like the other VR port of RE4, the move brings the whole game into virtual reality. The big news is that the update is coming this winter.


More immediately, we finally got confirmation that "Separate Ways" is coming to RE4. For the uninitiated, Separate Ways was a side campaign starring, you guessed it, Ada Wong, initially released with the PlayStation 2 and all subsequent versions of the original Resident Evil 4. Separate Ways will be released next week, on September 21.
Moreover, Both Ada Wong and Albert Wesker will be made available as playable characters in the Mercenaries game mode.
For more Resident Evil 4 Remake, check out our review.
Correction: An earlier version of this story mistakenly identified "Separate Ways" as "Assignment Ada." We regret the error.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bennett Foddy, the developer behind Getting Over It, released another trailer for Baby Steps during today's PlayStation State of Play. Foddy, along with fellow developers Gabe Cuzzillo and Maxi Boch, are bringing Baby Steps to PlayStation 5 next summer. 
Today's trailer stopped short of revealing a more exact release date, though. Baby Steps was revealed during a June PlayStation State of Play earlier this year. In it, players control Nate, an "unemployed failson with nothing going for him until one day, he discovers a power he never knew he had: putting one foot in front of the other." And as you might expect, players will control Nate on his journey to discover more of the world around him. 
Check out the new Baby Steps trailer for yourself below:


Baby Steps will hit PlayStation 5 and PC during the summer of 2024.]]></summary>

Ascendant founder and CEO Bret Robbins released a statement on Twitter today, explaining the large reduction in staff. He says it was a painfully difficult decision but a necessary one following the release of Immortals of Aveum on August 22. Here’s Robbins’ statement in full:

These layoffs follow the release of Immortals of Aveum, a game we thoroughly enjoyed, on August 22. Before its launch, we went hands-on with Immortals of Aveum at Ascendant Studios and talked with the team about creating a new first-person shooter in Unreal Engine 5.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Another Code: Two Memories, or Trace Memory as it's known in North America, is a Nintendo DS game that launched on the handheld device way back in 2005. Its sequel, Another Code: R – Journey Into Lost Memories, launched on the Wii in 2009, but it never came to North America. Now, players can experience both games when Another Code: Recollection hits Switch in January. 
Another Code: Recollection is an enhanced collection of Trace Memory and Another Code: R launching on Switch on January 19, 2024. During today's Nintendo Direct, Nintendo revealed this collection of games with a new trailer showing enhanced visuals while pulling back the curtains on protagonist Ashley, who is traveling to the remote Blood Edward Island in search of her father. 
Check out the Another Code: Recollection reveal trailer for yourself below: 


After Ashley receives a letter from her father, who she believes to be dead, a chain of mysteries and visions from the past is set off, sending her to Blood Edward Island. There, Ashley must investigate her surroundings while solving puzzles to reveal the truth. Another Code: R completes Ashley's tale. In it, she journeys to Lake Juliet two years after the events of Trace Memory to uncover the hidden truth surrounding her mother. 
"This collection includes fully enhanced versions of both original games, featuring overhauled visuals, fully explorable environments, new voice acting, puzzles, music, and more," Nintendo's description of the game reads. "Optional hint and navigation systems have been added to help players new to adventure games." 
Another Code: Recollection will cost $59.99 and launch on Switch on January 19, 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dave the Diver has been one of the sleeper hits of the very busy year of video games that 2023 has been so far and continues to be. Dave the Diver hit PC earlier this year but now, developer Mintrocket has revealed the sushi restaurant management game will hit Switch next month. 
More specifically, Dave the Diver will launch on Switch on October 26, and it will do so with Switch-exclusive bonuses, but only for those who preorder.


The game will cost $19.99 on Switch and you can preorder it on the Nintendo eShop right now. You can also check out a demo of the game on Switch right now, too. Preordering the game before its release will get you a bonus skin for Dave's boat and an exclusive lamp decoration for the sushi restaurant. Mintrocket describes the boat skin as nostalgic and themed after an 8-bit visual style, whereas the lamp depicts Dave "in [a] charming retro style." 
"We're over the moon seeing and hearing the reception to our first game," Dave the Diver game director Jaeho Hwang writes in a press release. "Bringing this to the Switch community has been an important goal for us as we think the console is a home where the players will truly appreciate everything Dave the Diver has to offer." 
For the uninitiated, Dave the Diver tasks players with diving underwater to gather ingredients by day that are used to serve hungry customers at a seaside sushi restaurant at night. However, there's a mystery bubbling up from "the deepest depths of the Blue Hole, the setting that [Dave] will swim through in this incredible journey." 
Dave the Diver is currently available on PC. It hits Switch on October 26. 
While waiting for its Switch release, read Game Informer's Dave the Diver review.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Robotality and publisher Chucklefish have announced that Wargroove 2 will be released next month. More specifically, the sequel hits Switch and PC on October 5, just a few months shy of the first Wargroove's fourth anniversary. 
Chucklefish announced the Wargroove 2 release date during today's Nintendo Direct alongside a new trailer showing more of the game's beautiful pixel art and challenging turn-based combat. It also highlighted the new commanders to control, a new playable faction in Wargroove 2, and the sequel's three interweaving campaigns. 
Check out the Wargroove 2 release date trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, this new trailer reveals the Faahri Republic, which Chucklefish describes as "a nation of curious mouse-folk who have landed in Aurania on a scholarly expedition."
"What the Faahri Republic lacks in military experience, they more than make up for with academic theory," a press release reads. "Equipped with mysterious crystal technology, Commanders Lytra, Pistil, and Rhomb must work together in pursuit of information for their mysterious benefactors." 
Elsewhere in the press release, Chucklefish says Wargroove 2 features new recruits and veteran wardogs to control alongside the game's new commanders. You can supercharge those commanders with a newly updated Groove system, too. Once you're done with Wargroove 2's three campaign arcs, you can battle with or against friends in co-op and multiplayer modes, both locally and online, with up to three other players. 

Preorders for Wargroove 2 are now live on PC and Switch. On Steam and Nintendo Europe and North American eShops, you can preorder for 20% off today. The game's full price is $19.99.
Wargroove 2 hits Switch and PC next month on October 5.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Vanillaware released 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim in 2020, and it was a bit of a sleeper hit. However, this team is also behind other games like Dragon's Crown and Odin Sphere. Now, Vanillaware has announced Unicorn Overlord, a new tactical fantasy RPG, and it launches March 8 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4 as a digital-only game, and Switch.
During today's Nintendo Direct, the team announced this new game with a trailer showcasing its various characters, unique art style, and tactics gameplay. And perhaps unsurprisingly, it looks great. 
Check out the Unicorn Overlord reveal trailer for yourself below: 


Vanillaware says Unicorn Overlord combines overworld exploration with an innovative battle system that's very reminiscent of Vanillaware's combat style. In the game, you'll "traverse the vibrant world, cultivate a grand army with over 60 uniquely designed characters, and grow your renown throughout the five nations in this unique epic fantasy experience." 
In addition to a Standard Edition of Unicorn Overlord, Vanillaware will also release a Collector's Edition that includes a physical copy of the game, a premium box, a 16-bit BGM soundtrack CD that consists of two discs with 10 tracks on each, a 132-page artbook, and an original card game for Unicorn Overlord that includes 239 cards, tokens, and markers. The Collector's Edition also includes the "Atlus x Vanillaware Heraldry pack and preorder DLC, which lets you customize the Liberation Army’s flag with emblem designs from Odin Sphere, Dragon's Crown, and 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim." 
Unicorn Overlord launches on March 8, 2024, on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4 (digital only), and Switch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During today's Nintendo Direct, the company announced release dates and windows for some highly anticipated Amiibo figures, namely, the Zelda and Ganondorf Amiibo for The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, the Noah and Mio Amiibo for Xenoblade Chronicles 3, and the Kingdom Hearts Sora Amiibo for his inclusion on the Super Smash Bros. Ultimate roster. 
All five Amiibo look great, as Nintendo has especially become great at making these figures compared to the first few runs of Amiibo. Nintendo announced that the Zelda and Ganondorf Amiibo for Tears of the Kingdom were coming back in June, and now we know exactly when: both hit stores on November 3. While the two figures were announced together, each will be sold individually. Each Amiibo unlocks a special fabric for your paraglider in Tears of the Kingdom and special materials and weapons for the game. 
The Xenoblade Chronicles 3 Noah and Mio Amiibo go live on January 19, 2024. These two will be released as a single set. The Noah Amiibo gets you Consul N’s Armor for Noah in-game and the Leisure Time outfits for Noah, Lanz, and Eunie. The Mio Amiibo unlocks Consul M’s Armor for Mio and Leisure Time outfits for Mio, Sena, and Taion. 
And finally, the Kingdom Hearts Sora Amiibo for Super Smash Bros. Ultimate will join the figure lineup sometime in 2024. 
While waiting to get each, read Game Informer's review of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and then read Game Informer's review of Xenoblade Chronicles 3. After that, watch the Kingdom Hearts IV reveal trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Supergiant Games, the company behind Hades and Bastion, has revealed that it will launch Hades II into Early Access in the second quarter of 2024 on PC via Steam and the Epic Games Store. The company stopped short of revealing a concrete date, though. 
Supergiant announced Hades II during The Video Game Awards 2022 last December, with plans to launch it into Early Access. This is the same strategy they took with the first Hades before its critically acclaimed 1.0 launch in 2020 on PC and Switch and 2021 on PlayStation and Xbox. Now, roughly nine months later, Supergiant has released a development update about the highly anticipated sequel, which is where it revealed the Q2 2024 Early Access launch window.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bloomberg reports that two Unity Technologies Inc. offices closed today following a "credible death threat" amidst ongoing controversy regarding a new per-install fee implemented for developers using Unity. The company also canceled a planned town hall, according to Bloomberg. 
Two days ago, Unity revealed plans to charge developers using the Unity video game engine a per-install fee that would be enacted every time a player installed their games. Developers were quick to point out issues with this per-install fee, like players' ability to install, delete, install, rinse, and repeat to cost developers money as a form of retaliation, amongst other things. Many developers publicly called for Unity to walk back these changes. While Unity has addressed some of the concerns, developers are still wary of trusting the company moving forward, with some developers signaling they might move development to completely different engines in light of this fee. 
Unity CEO John Riccitiello had plans to address company staff during a town hall this morning but instead canceled it and closed the company's Austin, Texas, and San Francisco, California, offices as a result of death threats Unity received it perceived to be credible.

The terrible beauty of that generator-based exploration and scavenging loop. That moment when you walk just a little too quickly down a corridor, and hear the awful rummaging in the walls. The agonising discovery that not only is it possible to roam with the lights out, but pretty much required, beyond a certain point. The dense burden of grasping more or less where to go, without knowing how to survive the journey - and above all else, those goddamn rats, always encountered where least convenient. Shoo! Shoo!
It's by far the most oppressive and demanding horror game I've played in recent memory, and it'll get considerably worse with the release of the Halloween update.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On paper, Final Fantasy XIV doesn’t do a very good job of encouraging fishing. FFXIV’s lead director and producer Naoki Yoshida — known as Yoshi P — wanted to create something that was "fun, but relaxing”, and there aren’t a lot of material rewards for the time you put in. You can sell the fish or break them down into other materials, but really the only reason to fish is for the sake of fishing itself. 

And yet today Final Fantasy XIV is home to a close knit fishing community of over 27,000 people. This single shared interest has spun off into many different directions, including fishing as a competitive journey, the process of building a space for the hobby itself, and even a kind of metagame. But the main thread tying these all together is the love for fishing, and the community’s central hub is actually located outside of the game - in a Discord server called Fisherman’s Horizon, lovingly nicknamed Fishcord.

I fear we are reaching that point with the life and times of Mary Read, my Starfield character and nowadays quite accomplished space pirate, who has sworn never to land on a planet ever again. 


Immediately after conquering the Chimera in Part 2 of the Starfield No-Planet Run, I commandeered a UC Longsword II on the other side of the same system. The Longsword has proven a predator without equal, charging straight through opposing craft even when they've got several levels on me, its unforgiving autocannons forming the dominant bassline of every encounter. Frankly, it's getting repetitive, and while the obvious remedy is to plunge cackling and crying into a star system with an AI threat level in the high double digits, I doubt that will really alter the rhythms of Starfield's ship combat - it'll just mean I have to do some grinding.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[NCSoft has announced that Battle Crush, its upcoming battle royale brawler, is coming to Nintendo Switch in addition to the previously known PC and mobile release. On top of that, the company revealed that all versions will receive a closed beta test next month, complete with crossplay.
In Battle Crush, players choose a character and fight to be the strongest of a pool of 30 players as the ground collapses around them. Due to ever-encroaching waves of enemies and unique battle arenas, players must be thoughtful with their placement and strategies. The player characters, called Calixers, cover a wide range of influences, often drawing inspiration from mythological figures. Battle royale may be the main mode, but Battle Crush also offers Brawl mode, where a player chooses three Calixers to fight with on a smaller map, and Build-Up, a one-on-one mode where two players compete for a best-of-five series.
Players can sign up for Battle Crush's closed beta test, which is slated to run from October 23 through October 30 on Switch, PC, and Android. Battle Crush is currently planned to launch in spring 2024.]]></summary>

The 2020 launch of Cyberpunk 2077 was terrible. Anticipation reached a point that no reasonable game could meet. Cyberpunk could have potentially grappled with those lofty expectations, but the major problem was its technical proficiency – or lack thereof. Despite the game getting good reviews (a product of press only being given PC copies) for most players, the game crashed frequently or was riddled with bugs. The PlayStation 4 version was pulled from shelves and taken offline. The content of the game – the story, the characters, the mechanics – was barely discussed in the face of players struggling even to explore the neon-soaked streets of Night City. It was a disaster, and fingers were pointed in many directions at…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this summer, Nintendo revealed WarioWare: Move It, a new game set in the long-running "microgame" series. Ahead of its release later this year in November, Nintendo released a new trailer for WarioWare: Move It during today's Nintendo Direct. In it, we learned more about its various microgames and what a "Form" is. 
Forms are the specific poses players must perform during microgames. You might have to squat down and flap your arms, like a chicken, to push an egg out of your virtual WarioWare: Move It avatar, for example. In these microgames, you'll need to perform the correct action while in the right form as quick as you can. And you'll need to do so quickly because Nintendo says microgames come one after another in quick succession. 
Check these WarioWare: Move It microgames out for yourself in the trailer below: 


Eslewhere in today's trailer, we learned more about WarioWare: Move It's Party Mode, which will allow up to four players to compete against each other. You might have to reach a goal without getting caught by Medusa's gaze, for example, or settle a score in an arena to be the last one posing. 
Between Party Mode and the single-player modes of WarioWare: Move It, Nintendo says there are over 200 microgames to play through. 
WarioWare: Move It hits Switch November 3.

F-Zero 99 is a battle royale version of the game, similar to other recent Switch experiments like Tetris 99 and Mario 35. Check out the reveal trailer below.


The game will take place on classic F-Zero courses with machines from the original SNES game, and as the name implies, it will support up to 99 players at once. In addition to beating the competition, you'll have to avoid running into obstacles to keep from exploding. You can also complete missions to unlock new cosmetic options to customize your machine.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this summer, Nintendo announced that Princess Peach was getting her own game. At the time, they referred to the project as Untitled Princess Peach Game but during today's Nintendo Direct, the company revealed its official name: Princess Peach Showtime! 
Princess Peach Showtime hits Switch early next year on March 22. Alongside the reveal of the game's name and its release date, Nintendo also shared new details about what to expect. Princess Peach and some Toads took a trip to the Sparkle Theater to see a play. But when the Wicked Grape and the Sour Bunch arrive, it's up to Princess Peach to save the day . 
Check it out for yourself in the Princess Peach Showtime trailer below:


Princess Peach hops onto the stage with the help of Sparkle Theater guardian Stella to take down the Sour Bunch and hopefully, their leader, Wicked Grape. To do that, Princess Peach will have to make her way through a variety of plays, transforming along the way. We see her become Swordfighter Peach, with a Muskateer-esque outfit to go with it. As Swordfighter Peach, she can use a rapier to take down the Sour Bunch and other enemies before her. But that's just one play. 
Today's trailer also revealed Princess Peach will become Detective Peach to determine who is stealing artifacts from a museum. We also see her become Patisserie Peach in an effort to find stolen desserts, and Kung Fu Peach to stop the Sour Bunch from taking over a martial arts school. 

This was just a taste of the transformations that await in Princess Peach Showtime, too. 
Princess Peach Showtime hits Switch on March 22, 2024.

First, Action Commands will increase the damage dealt or reduce how much damage you take. If you time your attacks just right, you're able to damage all enemies at the same time. A gauge in the lower left corner of the screen will fill with every Action Command, which can be used for a Triple Move, which combines the attacks of all three characters in your party.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Splatoon 3 entered the Switch's library with a splash last year, but Nintendo isn't done supporting the squid-based shooter just yet. Today, we got a new look at wave 2 of the game's expansion pack, titled Side Order. You can watch the trailer below.


The trailer takes place at the foot of the Spire of Order, a new location largely devoid of color. We see the return of Agent 8, the protagonist from Splatoon 2's Octo Expansion interact with a new character named Acht (which is notably German for the word "eight"), who claims to go "way back" with Marina, one of the hosts of Splatoon 2. Meanwhile, Pearl, her co-host, seems to be embodying a robot that accompanies Agent 8 throughout the world.
Acht gives Agent 8 color chips that modify their abilities, like increasing certain damage types or boosting run speed. After the trailer, Takahashi mentioned that the DLC was designed to be played "over and over again," possibly implying the game will have roguelike elements. You can check it out yourself when Side Order hits the eShop in spring 2024.

I actually wrote about Deathbulge in a round up of best demos in a Steam Next Fest back in 2020, at which time I enjoyed the RPG antics of a band entering a cursed Battle Of The Bands competition and finding out that it's a fight to the death. The full thing came out a month ago without my noticing, and got past the endpoint of the demo. It's fun! I'm enjoying the combat, which is both real-time and turn-based, and has some surprisingly deep tactics attached to it. But more importantly, the full Deathbulge game starts in a town where you enter houses by kicking doors in.

Anton Napolsky and Valeriia Ermakova were arrested in Argentina, where they are currently 'home confined’ pending their extradition battle. Meanwhile, their lawyers are trying to convince a New York federal court to dismiss the case for a myriad of reasons.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When the Lenovo Legion Go revealed itself, I was unconvinced by its portability credentials but enticed by the wireless mouse transmogrification of its detachable, Nintendo Switch-like controllers. A sparkling sliver of Swiss Army handheld design, providing a familiar taste of desktop play that the Steam Deck or Asus ROG Ally could never achieve without a USB dock.
Turns out, now that I’ve tried the Legion Go for myself, I was worried about the wrong thing. It’s nowhere near as heavy or cumbersome as it looks, and while the breakaway controls remain an exciting prospect, they also risk introducing an acute pain point. At the very least, the model I tested proved highly vulnerable to lead-handed RPS hardware editors, because I left the building very much with the impression that I’d broken it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As gaming at large gorges itself on a feast of fantastic titles, PCVR crawls beneath the table licking up the crumbs. There are tasty treats simmering in the kitchen, like the remake of The 7th Guest and sequels to I Expect You To Die and Arizona Sunshine, but right now all the fine dining is happening on Quest and PSVR2, covering which would involve running my thumb under RPS' hermetic PC seal.


In my desperation, I've turned to golf, something I would never consider under normal circumstances. I feel about golf the same way I feel about the UK Conservative party, insofar as both occupy space that would be better filled with trees. But I haven't gone totally tartan slacks. We're only entering the realm of minigolf, which I am more positively inclined toward. It lacks the pretensions and exclusionary nature of its bigger, paunchier cousin. Anybody can rock up to a minigolf course with a putter and nobody will sneer at you for being shit at it. It's also small and inherently naff, traits I can likewise relate to.

The company will only make developers pay extra for the first installation of a game on a new device - so no fees for reinstallations, in theory, and no prospect of spiteful players "install bombing" games to drive up costs for their creators. However, the company haven't stated how or indeed, if they can distinguish legitimate from illegitimate installations in advance, seemingly because their method for tracking installations is based on "estimates" using a proprietary data-gathering system, which they aren't able to discuss in depth.

Minecraft! After a month reporting on the barren planets of Starfield and plundering the rather more involving dungeons of Baldur's Gate 3, it's almost steadying to remember that these supposed titans are but momentary flickers, transient particles in the sunken Creeper eyesocket of Mojang's behemoth. And what a time to rediscover the game. Vanilla Minecraft has always felt like an autumnal creation to me, even before they added all the pumpkin heads - a game of long nights and campfires, with an ambience derived from Tove Jansson's Moomin books. Anyway, here's the teaser trailer for Minecraft Live.

I think the outcome is partially from a love of cards, and partially a dislike of the impact fast travel has had on game design. Can't deny it's convenient, mind. This week, I ask you to pick between taking things you want and something that should always have been ours. What's better: capturing enemy buildings, or hand grenades exploding on impact with enemies?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There’s something that feels oddly momentous about sending one of Dune: Spice Wars’ harvesters to get to work worm-dodging while hoovering up MSG (magical space glitter). It was, after all, Dune II’s implementation of these trucks that are largely responsible for the shape of the entire RTS genre. I’ve mused before that if you count Alien as something that wouldn’t exist without Dune, along with the effects the RTS had on esports, it's wild to consider how different gaming could have been if Frank Herbert hadn’t visited Florence in 1957 to chronicle a natural phenomenon. It’s one heck of a butterfly effect, which is fitting, because Spice Wars itself can often feel like a creative exploration of how integral butterfly effects are to grand strategy rulesets. Forget those harvesters for a moment, because this dry but undeniably captivating 4X is all about the steamroll.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You can’t fault the pitch. In Gunbrella you’re a sort of cowboy dude with a shotgun that’s also an umbrella. You use the umbrella to deflect enemy projectiles, block attacks, fly up into the air like a furious Mary Poppins and zoom along ziplines. You use the shotgun, as you might reasonably expect, to do the majority of your big murdering.


Gunbrella is a classic 2D platform shooter in the style of a steampunk western. It’s like Deadwood crossed with Singin’ In The Rain, if Gene Kelly ever used his umbrella to blow holes through anyone who didn’t sufficiently praise his tap dancing. Some light exploration bits have you travelling by train from frontier towns to mining villages, much of them decorated with giant spinning cogs – so you know it’s steampunk – and populated by a small cast of quest-giving locals, pill-dispensing shopkeepers and monologuing villains.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of my favourite TV shows is The Rookie, because you never have any idea what could happen next. No episode can go more than five minutes without some kind of twist, often with no relation to anything that has happened up until that point. Like, you think the stand-off between criminals and their victims in a courthouse nuclear bunker has been resolved, but it turns out that while the camera was off him, a lawyer got stabbed by someone else. Hauma is bringing that kind of energy to the visual novel space. 
You play as Judith, a former detective and champion boxer who's wrapped up in solving the case her grandfather was working on before he died. On its face, Hauma is therefore a detective game in a pretty cool 2D comic book-style, with a slightly worse version of the Frogwares Sherlock Holmes mind palace as your inventory of clues, which you combine to logic your way through puzzles. But at the point where you're in a tunnel under the ruins of a Nazi temple in Munich, having discovered that the MacGuffin is a shin bone carved with the recipe for an eternal life drink (which was stolen by some nuns and taken to Bavaria, and then the nuns all got pregnant I guess?) - and, secondly, having recently survived a massive explosion at an Oktoberfest beer tent - you kind of think, well, things have gotten quite out of hand, haven't they?

Lies of P developer Neowiz proudly calls its The Adventures of Pinocchio-inspired action game a Soulslike, drawing direct attention to its From Software inspiration. The proclamation is a bold and risky move. While there are great contenders in this action subgenre, even the best are a few marks from what From Software creates and I went into Lies of P with that expectation. But then I put 40 hours into Lies of P in just five days, something I rarely do with any game. And then I doubled back on a save to get …]]></summary>

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2023/09/13/nintendo-direct-announced-for-tomorrow-with-40-minutes-of-games-coming-this-winter"/>
        <updated>2023-09-13T14:03:56.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo has consistently been a fan of airing Nintendo Directs during September, with the usual September Directs being some of the most exciting of the year. And the company will continue that streak in 2023 as it has announced a Nintendo Direct will air tomorrow, September 14.
The company revealed this on Twitter today, stating that the direct will run for "roughly 40" minutes at 7 a.m. PT/10 a.m. ET on September 14. 
Tune in on Sept. 14 at 7 a.m. PT for a #NintendoDirect livestream featuring roughly 40 minutes of information focused on #NintendoSwitch games releasing this winter.
https://t.co/tUb8vyZNfx pic.twitter.com/WJcQ5ZQl1b
September 13, 2023
As for what to expect, there's a lot of unknowns circling this Direct. Super Mario Bros. Wonder is the big upcoming release from Nintendo, but that just got its own dedicated direct last month. That's the same direct where we learned Nintendo was releasing a new Mario Red OLED Switch, too. 
Detective Pikachu Returns is another big Switch exclusive releasing next month, and it's likely we'll see more of it during this Direct. We just went hands-on with it last week and you can read our impressions of that here. There's plenty more coming to Switch in the last few months of 2023, too, but admittedly, exclusives are sparse. September Directs from Nintendo usually give players a look ahead at the next year so we're hoping to learn more about the company's 2024 plans. Considering "this winter" dips into next year, it seems we will learn more about the early months of 2024.
On that note, Nintendo reportedly demoed the Switch successor to developers at Gamescom last month, and other reports indicate this new console will be portable like the Switch and is targeting a release in the second half of 2024. Perhaps we'll learn about it during this Direct. Only time will tell. 
This Nintendo Direct will air at 7 a.m. PT/10 a.m. ET and will run for roughly 40 minutes. 
What do you hope to see from this Nintendo Direct? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cor, has it really been almost half a year since we've done one of these? Apologies, readers. I honestly don't know where the time goes. It's probably because we're spending too much time with our favourite guilty pleasure games, which is the subject of this latest Ask RPS column.  
The question comes courtesy of ronzilla, who asked: What were your favourite guilty pleasure games of 2022? As in, I play this all the time and I'm semi-embarrassed to admit it? 
A good question! In canvassing the wider RPS Treehouse for their responses, it quickly became clear that most of our guilty pleasure games extend way beyond the bounds of just the year 2022, so we've answered a bit more broadly than the original question perhaps intended. Still, hopefully there are still some entertaining answers in here nonetheless.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The internet isn’t fun anymore. Actually, that statement isn’t severe enough to reflect how bad the internet is these days, so let me try that again: being online in 2023 is a fucking nightmare. There are only three websites. They are all designed to make you angry because it’s the most profitable emotion. Your aunt was indoctrinated into fascism by a page called “This country used to have real bin men” after she liked a meme about glass milk bottles in 2012. Every boy you went to school with has a podcast about football now. Your Mam once warned you about spending too much time on the computer but now spends eight hours a day playing Hay Day on her phone. AI was meant to let us lie in fields and read books, but instead it’s being used to show you what Breaking Bad would have looked like as an anime.
But it didn’t used to be like this! Obviously I don’t need to remind our regular readers about the glory days of the information superhighway because some of you are old enough to be my Dad (and I’m thirty-one) but just in case a member of Gen Z has stumbled upon this article by accident: the internet used to be fun. Like, really fun, and Hypnospace Outlaw is living proof of it.

In response to widespread criticism of the changes from game developers, Unity have since posted a further statement, saying, "Yes, this is a price increase and it will only affect a small subset of current Unity Editor users."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple held a special keynote event today to reveal the iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max, new Apple Watches, and more. While new iPhones aren’t exactly surprising given the company's annual cadence, what is surprising is that Apple has also announced that Resident Evil 4 (Remake), Resident Evil Village, Assassin's Creed Mirage, and Death Stranding are coming to the iPhone 15 Pro and the iPhone 15 Pro Max, as reported by IGN. 

While details were sparse, Apple showed a few screens of the games on a virtual version of the iPhone 15 Pro during today's event, stopping short of showing gameplay of these games running on the newly announced phones. It's unclear what the gameplay experiences for these games will be like on the iPhone 15 Pro and Max; considering it's already possible to connect a Bluetooth controller, like the PlayStation DualSense or Xbox Series X/S gamepad, to various Apple devices, it's not a stretch to assume that’s the best way to play these games on this new device. 
As for how these games run on the devices, that remains to be seen. Apple says both Resident Evil games and Death Stranding will be available on the phones later this year, while Assassin's Creed Mirage hits the devices in the first half of 2024, according to IGN.
Resident Evil 4 Remake launched earlier this year, while Capcom released Resident Evil Village in 2021. Assassin's Creed Mirage is Game Informer's current cover story game, with an exclusive coverage hub as well, and the latest entry in this long-running franchise hits PlayStation, Xbox, and PC on October 5. 
Read Game Informer's Resident Evil 4 Remake review here, and then check out our thoughts on Resident Evil Village. For more about Assassin's Creed Mirage, check out our exclusive coverage hub here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft has announced a new Xbox Series X/S controller with a deep purple color scheme on the front and a bright white back. Aptly, this new controller is titled "Astral Purple." It looks great and is available for preorder now before its September 19 release date. 
Xbox says, "This rich purple color has a distinct regal look to spice up your gaming setup and bolster your collection," noting that the dark purple theme carries over to both thumbsticks, all four face buttons, and the three menu buttons in the center of the controller. The triggers, bumpers, and d-pad feature a matte black finish, and the back case is a bright white. 
Like most other Xbox Series X/S controllers, the Astral Purple edition will cost $64.99. It's available for preorder and releases on September 19. As expected, it features all the usual bells, whistles, and features of the standard Xbox Series X/S controller, so if you’re looking to add a little more purple to your collection, this might be for you. 
While waiting for its release, check out the Stormcloud Vapor controller revealed last month and then read about the Xbox Elite Series 2 "Core" Edition controller. After that, read Game Informer's list of the top 10 best Xbox Series X/S games.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[NetherRealm Studios' latest 2D fighter, Mortal Kombat 1, is right around the corner. Premium and Kollector Editions of the game go live this Thursday, September 14, and the regular edition goes live next week on September 19. Ahead of the game's release, NetherRealm has released the official launch trailer, featuring four minutes of new gameplay, fatalities, gore, and more. 
Today's trailer also features our first look at gameplay for Shang Tsung, whom you get if you preorder the game, more of the story, which centers on a rebooted Mortal Kombat universe by way of Fire God Liu Kang, and Reiko, General Shao's second-in-command. Check it out for yourself below:


Shang Tsung is still a sorcerer and his moveset in the trailer reflects that, with fiery projectiles, massive combos, and the ability to morph into other fighters. Reiko, on the other hand, is described by NetherRealm as "a savage warrior with a fighting style that matches his fierce persona." Elsewhere in the trailer, we get new looks at many of the roster's other fighters, like the Jean-Claude Van Damme skin for Johnny Cage and the recently revealed Nitara, who Megan Fox voices. 
Mortal Kombat 1 hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC on September 14 for Premium and Kollector editions of the game. The rest of the editions go live on September 19. 
While waiting for the game's release, watch Ed Boon talk about Mortal Kombat 1 on hot wing-eating interview show Hot Ones, and then watch this Nitara gameplay trailer. After that, read our hands-on impressions of Mortal Kombat 1's Invasions and Story Mode.

Id Software's 1997 shooter was fancied up with a remaster released as a free update in August, complete with all the old stuff and one notable new addition. MachineGames, the studio behind the modern Wolfenstein games, have created a whole new story campaign for the remaster. I've really enjoyed playing it. It's the old Quake 2 you know and have complicated feelings about, filtered through modern design sensibilities. I think both veterans and newcomers could enjoy blasting these biomechanical alien horrors.

Lake added that, Remedy's sense of audience expectations notwithstanding, he himself has difficulty setting aside hours for longer games. "[It's] just struggling with finding time and you know, being interested in a story, wanting to see it through," he said. "So it can even be daunting at times to start playing a game that you know is really, really long."

There's also a physical limited edition coming to Europe on 23rd October, for those of you who revel in such things as portraits of faction leaders, packs of cosmetics and posters of the game's campaign map, which you can also check out in the new campaign flyover video below.


In case you're wondering, I've checked with the authorities and yes, PHARAOH should be written in all capitals, making a laughing stock of all previous RPS reporting. If it feels unnatural, try to imagine that you're bellowing the game's title from the summit of a pyramid, so as to remind your embattled subjects of your magnificence. RPS boss Katharine behaves similarly in morning meetings. "EDITOR-IN-CHIEF," she roars at us repeatedly, until somebody rushes her the daily traffic reports, a steaming goblet of sphinx eggs and a gif of a crafty kill in Shadow Gambit.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["Usually, when a player is going through a strategy game, they figure out how things work by trial and error," Total War: Pharaoh's game director Todor Nikolov tells me at this year's Gamescom. "And once they do, they feel the urge to start a brand-new campaign because they've already figured out that portion of the gameplay."
Sitting across the table, these words ring frighteningly true for me. Unbeknownst to Nikolov, he has just described the exact experience I had playing the 50-turn campaign preview for Pharaoh a week earlier to an absolute tee. Unlike the far more knowledgeable brain of frequent RPS contributor Nic Reuben, I am a complete babe in arms when it comes to the Total War juggernaut machine, and it took me attempting to play two other games in the series (Three Kingdoms and Troy) and several restarts in Pharaoh itself before I felt just about confident that I (very vaguely) knew what I was doing. At the time, I thought, 'Man alive, how is Total War still so rubbish at teaching players how it works?' But when I speak to Nikolov a week later, he has some very welcome news for me: there's going to be a dedicated tutorial campaign where players can (hopefully) find their feet. Music to my ears.

This song believes in you, aggressively so. "MythForce! MythForce! Everyday people become heroes! / MythForce! MythForce! You and me, we can defeat evil!" The roguelike dungeon dallying that follows doesn't take that "you can do it!" Saturday morning cartoon flavour to its comedic conclusion in the same way an Adult Swim animation might, or a Devolver game would. Instead the real focus seems to be function over flavour, resulting in a skeleton-battering jaunt that is competent and comfortable, yet never fully embracing the silliness promised by the sick guitar riffs of the theme.

Rather than tasking players with cooking a proper dish, developer Terrifying Jellyfish presents a playspace of ingredients, tools like blowtorches and meat tenderizers, and a suite of odd abilities that change gravity, freeze food, and make your culinary ingredients dance — all in the name of playfulness. While levels contain hidden experiences you can unlock by specific interactions, there's hardly a central goal in Nour. Similar to Townscaper, this joyful release is more akin to a toy than a game, and it's so much fun.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Being a dedicated spacer I've never had much interest in the base construction aspect of Starfield, but that was before I learned that you can spacewalk by means of console commands, aka cheats. Reddit user WeirdConcern4666 made history on this front yesterday. Here's how you do it: 1) get up from the cockpit controls, 2) hit the tilde key to open the command console at the bottom of the screen, 3) type "player.setpos x 10" to teleport your character outside the ship, then hit return and 4) type "setgravityscale 0" to engage zero gravity and stop your character plummeting endlessly. Then hit the tilde key again to close the command console, and well, there you go.
Space sure is bigger outside a spaceship, isn't it? Just as well you brought that jetpack. If your vessel of choice is on the bulky side, like mine, you might need to increase the number on the end of "player.setpos" to escape the invisible barriers around your craft's exterior. Witness my character Mary Read's first attempts at a spacewalk below. If you've somehow discarded your jetpack, you can always punt yourself about with the recoil from an appropriately chunky firearm.

Alongside Todoroki, Eijiro Kirishima and Mina Ashido are in the Item Shop available for purchase.

With Todoroki on the island, developer Epic Games has added his Ice Wall as an item to the game. With the Ice Wall, you gain the power to summon glacial shields that stand taller than players anywhere. It has a large pool of health and remains in play until its health is depleted. Plus, when you use it, everyone around it is knocked back. They also gain icy feet, which will cause them to slip and slide all over the place.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I don't know about you, but after spending 100+ hours in both Assassin's Creed Odyssey and Assassin's Creed Valhalla, I'm well up for an AC game that reins its open world in a bit and goes back to the sort-of single city stab-athon the series used to be. The ones where stealth actually mattered, and you felt like a proper assassin working from the shadows. Assassin's Creed Mirage is all this to a tee - as Ubisoft have taken great pains to remind us over the last year as they gear up to celebrate the series' 15th anniversary. 
And after spending three hours playing some of its early mission sequences, I can confirm this is very much a game whose sole purpose is to scratch that nostalgic itch good and proper (before we inevitably hurl ourselves into the still very ambiguous void of whatever the heck Assassin's Creed Infinity is). If, however, you don't have much fondness for those older games, and prefer the more action-oriented RPG-ing of recent Creeds, Mirage is probably going to feel like a step backward from all the things you know and like - and you may be better off waiting until the next big open world entry set in feudal Japan pitches up instead.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The first time I heard of Steam it was, as you might expect, in conjunction with the release of a little FPS called Half-Life 2 back in 2004. You needed Steam to access it, whether you bought the digital version or a retail copy. Given relative unfamiliarity with digital distribution, the nascent status of broadband internet in the UK and US, and the much greater importance of physical game sales at the time, this caused quite a stir. I remember being alarmed by an op-ed over on GameRevolution.com that held forth at length about the risk of conflicts between Steam and other software, if players were outright required to leave it running. How quaint those anxieties seem today - the day of Steam's 20th anniversary. And yet, there's nothing quaint about Steam's ability to shape the field in which it operates.

NBA 2K24 should have been the perfect platform to celebrate Kobe Bryant's career and his ever-lasting influence on the game of basketball. Instead, his legacy gets overshadowed by omnipresent microtransactions and stale game modes. As a result, NBA 2K24 feels like a dull, lopsided blowout as opposed to a memorable, adrenaline-inducing affair like the ones the Black Mamba often blessed us with throughout his career.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hitting pause in a video game is like dropping a wall across it. On one side of the wall lies what is called the diegetic space of the game, aka the fictitious world, which is generally the aspect that receives the most interest, the aspect that tends to attract the weasel word "immersive". On the other side of the wall lie menus, settings and other features that form a non-diegetic layer of bald operator functions - technical conveniences and lists of things to tweak or customise, from graphics modes to character inventory, that are cut adrift in a vacuum outside of time. 


In theory, the pause screen and its contents are not truly part of the game. There is no temporality, no sense of place, no threat, no possibility of play, no character or narrative, no save the princess, no press X to Jason or pay respects, no gather your party before travelling forth. As the scholar Madison Schmalzer points out in the paper I'm wonkily paraphrasing here, "the language of the menu itself emphasizes the menu's position as outside of gameplay by labeling the option to continue as 'resume game.' The game world is always privileged as the site that gameplay happens."

We enjoyed the game, giving it an 8.25 out of 10 – you can read our review here. If you haven’t jumped into From Software’s latest action title yet, though, you might be in luck because a new patch that's now live buffs various weapons and adjusts some boss attacks. 
From Software released Patch 1.02 today, and while the overall update is small, it buffs nearly 10 weapons and fixes a smattering of bugs. The studio says, “[This] new patch has been distributed to improve gameplay stability and make balance adjustments” and that it is “focused on balance adjustments that will allow players more build diversity in the early and mid-game whe…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There was a time back in my school days when cardgames were all the rage. Everybody had a deck of playing cards in their pocket for cheeky 15 minute rounds of Texas Hold 'Em between lessons, with Milky Way segments and Niknaks wagered in place of chips. Yes, I'm aware I'm starting to sound like Grandpa Simpson, and no, this wasn't from some murky era before the invention of videogames. It was the heyday of the Gameboy Advance! I'm not sure what we were thinking. But two things: 1) decks of playing cards are cheaper than game consoles, and 2) part of the fun, possibly, was that nobody really knew how to play the ostensibly well-known cardgames we were playing.
With the benefit of hindsight, I suspect there may have been creative liberties taken with the rules at times. I knew hair-pulling wasn't a legal move in professional poker. Anyway, I'm reminded of all this by Dungeons & Degenerate Gamblers, a warped and mildly satirical, 90s-styled take on Blackjack from Purple Moss Collectors.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[AMD's Radeon RX 6800 and 6800 XT graphics cards have proven surprisingly popular even into 2023, as new price drops (and relatively modest gen-on-gen performance increases for newer models) has left them as competitive options in terms of value for money. 
Today we've got a deal on the RX 6800 non-XT, with an MSI model going for just under $400 at Newegg. That's a $70 reduction from its usual price and $20 cheaper than the cheapest RX 6800 model on Amazon. That's an awesome deal for a strong 1440p graphics card that comes with a copy of Starfield Premium Edition (which includes the Shattered Space story expansion, a digital art book, the game's OST and a few weapon/suit skins on top of the base game).

I also know that its video game adaptation, released in 1995 for the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive, was a 16-bit platformer with a similar appeal to other Disney games of the period like Aladdin and The Lion King.

Both those games were re-released in 2021, and now it's Gargoyles' turn. There's a first trailer for Gargoyles Remastered below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Baldur’s Gate 3 is the latest, and perhaps greatest, attempt to bring the Dungeons & Dragons game to the video game world. At the same time, it’s a new chapter in a long legacy that surrounds the interplay between the original tabletop RPG and the video gaming hobby. It’s a strange truth that, even as a video game, Baldur’s Gate 3 has emerged as one of the most potent arguments in years for trying out the actual D&D game at a table.
When I was a kid growing up in the ‘80s, playing D&D was not something you would readily admit to. Beyond the open ridicule you might face from your peers, it had a genuine chance to get you barred from some of your friends’ homes. No joke. More than a few parents back then truly believed that D&D was tantamount to actual demon worship, and they wouldn’t want t…]]></summary>

For context, this laptop has a list price of $2099 and still seems to be selling new for $1679 on Amazon - so this price is very reasonable indeed.

The P5 Plus is a drive that we've covered many times over on the RPS Deals beat, as it comes very close in performance to the top options in its category - your Samsung 990 Pros and your WD SN850xs - while often costing much less.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I first clocked the mysterious-looking OU when Japanese indie collective Asobu did their pre-Bitsummit showcase stream in 2021. It wasn't entirely clear what OU was going to be at that point, other than a sort-of-puzzle game about an amnesiac boy who'd found himself in a fantastical world of picturebook pages, and even when Alicia Haddick played it for herself at Bitsummit proper the following year, OU still had a strong, impenetrable sense of ambiguity about it.  
But its striking art and rustic guitar soundtrack have stuck in my mind ever since, and finally, OU is now out in the wild. I've only played about two hours of it so far, but it's clear there's still a lot more to discover within its dreamy little vignettes. It's one of those games that's designed to be played multiple times to get the full extent of the story, and I've just hit the first of those Nier Automata-esque restarts. Honestly, I'm not quite sure what to think of it yet, but one thing is certain: I can't get it out of my head.

Publisher Behaviour Interactive (from Dead By Daylight fame) have now announced a free open playtest, available to everyone from now until September 21st. As lovely as the game looks, I’m excited to try Islands Of Insight for myself.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Although most of my favourite films are tragedies, games with a grim and heavy premise don't often appeal to me as much as you'd think. I wasn't quite expecting to enjoy The Man Came Around, then, as it's about a group of desperate people trying to cross the border to escape their authoritarian government. In Winter, no less.
It's actually rather light in practice, although not in a flippant or trivialising way. The message is clearly that these things are serious and our sympathies should be, well, basic concern for the wellbeing of other people. But it's not as miserable to play as games with such serious themes often are. The premise is serious, but the act of playing it is not. I'd call it "diverting" rather than "entertaining", but the bottom line is there's a good afternoon or two in there for you.

Scrolling through social media channels, you’ll find that players have hammered away at their own unique designs while also creatively remaking other iconic vessels from Mass Effect, Star Wars, Halo and, of course, our friend Thomas The Tank Engine. There’s also been a shocking lack of, uhm, male organ-shaped spacecraft which makes putting this post together much less hard. But for now, onward! Let’s admire some cool ships.

I spent most of my hour-long demo session steadily working my way through its extensive tutorial, as I have not, in fact, played Cities: Skylines before now - although I can at least confirm that its tutorial is very newbie-friendly, and that I now feel more prepared to give it a go properly when it comes out in full on October 24th.
But the thing that really impressed me was just the sheer scope of its playable spaces. We've known since the end of July that its maps are roughly 5x bigger than those in the first game, and when I saw Colossal Order's Maps & Themes video, I thought, 'Yes, those sure look enormous!' But actually seeing them in person really put things into perspective for me, especially when I tried zooming the camera out and it just kept going and going and going and…

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Paradox have announced that Star Trek: Infinite is coming out on October 12th. Infinite’s previous trailers already made it look like a "Stellaris in a different version of space" affair - which is by no means an unfavourable comparison - and the latest footage shows off more grand strategy shenanigans. Planet management. Lotsa menus. Expanding factions, sometimes peacefully if you prefer a clear conscience.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On today’s installment of Bad Calls I Have Made, I will cop to never really buying the idea of Starfield needing an SSD. Even among its astronomical system requirements, an inflexible demand for solid state storage seemed like a stretch; after all, Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart runs mostly fine on a hard drive, and in a previous life that game was employed as a cheerleader for the PS5’s SSD. Starfield would probably just have rubbish load times or texture pop-in or something, and all would be revealed once I could try it on mechanical storage. Which I now have.
So, can you play Starfield on an HDD? No. It’s bloody awful.

Since Lars Sundström, aka lman, joined our team as the iOS porter, we have made significant progress. Thus, you no longer need to compile ScummVM yourself in order to add it to your iOS or iPadOS device. 
If you want to help by testing this version, just follow this Testflight link and enroll yourself in the test program. This may require installing Apple’s Testflight app. You can find instructions on how to install games and how to play them on our documentation portal.
We truly appreciate your feedback. You can share your thoughts with the Testflight feedback feature, where you can attach screenshots and post detailed descriptions. Alternatively, you can use our bugtracker, e-mail us at ios@scummvm.org, or post on our Discord Server. Your help will let us eventually add ScummVM to the App Store.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some would say the best way to wind down after a rough day down the Content Reactors isn’t to play a grotty occult horror game, but I caught a trailer for Tenebris Somnia earlier, and couldn’t help myself. In this foetid offering from Argentinian devs Andrés Borghi and Tobías Rusjan of Saibot Studios, you play a young woman, Julia, who is visiting her film-maker ex-boyfriend to drop off their old apartment key. Julia’s having a hard time getting over the break-up, but she’s clearly doing better than her ex: his apartment is full of broken glass, anomalous red gloop and creepy occult books. 


The game’s twist is that it’s two visual styles thrust into the same frame. On the one hand, you'll explore an 8-bit world of unpleasantly bright colours, finding and combining objects adventure-game-style. I say adventure-game-style, because this is a bit more energetic than most adventure games – you can equip and swing a wrench, and there’s a run button. On the other hand, well. Click the headline to find out, if you dare. Yes, this is me trying to do a jumpscare. Brace yourself! (It's just occurred to me, 24 hours too late, that the above joke only makes sense if you're viewing our Latest feed. Everybody else, erm - scroll down?)

Either way, I’ve recently developed an intense appreciation for teeny, tiny microgames, to the point where I’ve essentially been begging in the RPS Slack channel for recommendations. Just one more Steam link and I’ll be fine, promise.
And I don’t mean short games in the seven- or eight-hour sense. Not even film-length games like Portal or Jazzpunk. No, I seek to gorge on the slightest sub-hour canapés, games in which you can see and do everything in one or hour or less. "Irresponsibly large"? Another time, Mister Starfield, I crave something irrevocably small.

This is important because ScummVM currently supports only the Macintosh versions of these games. These versions were produced by Tetraedge and are built on a completely different engine than the original Windows versions; basically, they are reimplementations, not ports. Now, thanks to the folks from ZOOM-Platform, you can easily obtain these game variants.
