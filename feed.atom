        <updated>2024-08-08T15:56:07.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The General Store in Fields of Mistria starts out with a fairly limited list of stock available to purchase. Although you can get by with the early items, it’s a good idea to upgrade the General Store once you’re able to. 


Unfortunately, you’re going to have to check off a few things before you can finally upgrade the General Store, so do the following first:



Unlock the Mines and reach level 20


Break the Water Seal on level 20 of the Mines


Repair the Mill 



How to upgrade the General Store in Fields of Mistria

The quest to begin the upgrade process for the General Store will come in the form of a letter in the mail from Adeline shortly after you finish repairing the Mill. The quest itself works in the same way as repairing the Bridge and Mill, with a donations box where you need to put the following resources:



300 Wood


500 Stone


5 Copper Ingots 


5 Iron Ingots



The Iron Ingots are the reason you need to break through the Water Seal in order to get this quest completed. Iron Ore is only available on floors 21-40 of the Mines, which are only accessible once the first seal is broken. 


You’ll also need a sizable sum of 3,000 Tesserae in order to complete the General Store’s makeover. Once you’ve raised this and placed all of the required resources into the donations box outside the Store, talk to Adeline to begin the upgrade.

Upgrading the General Store expands the available stock, enabling you to purchase items which you wouldn’t have been able to before. After upgrading, you’ll find a new range of seeds, furniture, and cooking ingredients available. 


However, the most exciting new item which becomes available for purchase is the second Backpack upgrade, which increases your on-player inventory to 30 slots.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new Diablo 4 season, a new chase for build-defining Uniques. If you're a Rogue looking to up their Combo Point game with Condemnation, you've got two pretty good options and a whole lotta quality of life to help you find it. All you'll need to do is fight two endgame bosses and cross your fingers.


How to summon Varshan and the Beast in Ice


Once you reach World Tier 3 by completing the Cathedral of Light dungeon in Kyovashad, you'll be able to summon and tackle endgame bosses. Each of them has their own loot table, but Condemnation drops from just two: Varshan and the Beast in Ice.


Varshan can be summoned within the chasm located next to the Tree of Whispers. As of season 5, it only takes Malignant Hearts to summon him, and if you've got other body parts from bounties or Grotesques Debtors you can turn them into Hearts at the Alchemist. What's more, you can summon him repeatedly without having to leave starting this season.

The Beast in Ice also got a lot easier to fight: just collect 9 Distilled Fear, which drops in Tier 30+ Nightmare Dungeons and head to the Glacial Fissure. No more crafting Sigils just to fight a boss, and, like with Varshan, you can summon him repeatedly. 


Fighting these foes shouldn't be too difficult if your build is somewhat optimized and you've got maxed resistances (Shadow for Varshan, and Ice for Beast in Ice, duh). If you're really lucky, you won't have to fight them at all, since Condemnation can drop from regular foes at a very low rate. Happy farming!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last year, the release of Counter-Strike 2 led to a resurgence in popularity for Valve's tactical first-person shooter franchise. A change of engine and a fresh coat of paint led to many of the game's maps looking fresher than ever.


In Counter-Strike 2, the Active Duty map pool determines the maps used in esports tournaments, as well as what can be played in Premier Mode. The pool is usually updated every 6-12 months, rotating maps in and out to ensure that the game never feels stale.

Current Counter-Strike 2 Active Duty map pool


Here are the seven maps featured in Counter-Strike 2's Active Duty map pool at the moment:



Ancient


Anubis


Dust 2


Inferno


Mirage


Nuke


Vertigo



Of the current Active Duty CS2 maps, Dust 2 is the most recent addition. It was previously removed in November 2022, before being reinstated in April 2024, replacing Overpass. Dust 2's history spans as far back as 2001, so it's a classic that keeps players coming back for more.


Valve tends to be secretive about Counter-Strike 2 updates. Because of this, we don't quite know when the next update to the Active Duty map pool will come. Many CS2 professionals are outspoken about their dismay at the current selection of maps, so it might not be long before change comes along.


Competitive Counter-Strike 2 maps


Outside of the Active Duty map pool, there are also several CS2 maps that gamers can play in the Competitive playlist. While you can't search for these maps in Premier Mode, they still offer a good time. When Valve decides to switch things up in the map pool, these are the maps it will choose from when not adding a new one.


Bomb Defusal



Mills


Overpass


Thera



Hostage Rescue



Italy


Office



Some maps from Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, such as Cache, Cobblestone, and Train, have yet to return. Valve has yet to confirm whether they will come back in a future Counter-Strike 2 update.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Do you remember when Ziggurat announced a remaster of Rendering Ranger: R²? I had forgotten about it (thanks for the reminder, Gematsu). However, it has resurfaced as Rendering Ranger: R² [Rewind]. It’s coming to PC, Switch, PS4, and PS5 later this year.


Ziggurat’s press release states Rendering Ranger: R² is the most expensive SNES game in the collector’s market, which isn’t true according to PriceCharting.com. It is, however, the most expensive Super Famicom game.




It also describes it as a side-scrolling action game, which might seem rather vague, but that’s because it alternates between horizontal shoot-’em-up and terrestrial run-and-gun. It was created by some of the people behind Turrican and Giana Sisters. Weirdly, it only came out in Japan, despite Rainbow Arts Software being a German company. According to Ziggurat, it only sold about 10,000 copies.


As a note, it did get an SNES release by Limited Run Games in 2022/23. They are also listed as developing the re-release, which means it will be powered by their Carbon Engine. That means it will have rewind, save states, and CRT filters. It will include Rendering Ranger: R² as well as Targa, the unreleased Western version.


Rendering Ranger: R²’s big claim to fame (aside from its price tag) is its technical showcase. It makes great use of the console’s scaling and rotating abilities, and ties in some 3D-to-2D objects, not unlike Donkey Kong Country.


It’s always nice to see an obscure old game get another chance at finding an audience.


Rendering Ranger: R² [Rewind] is coming to PC, Switch, PS4, and PS5 later this year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After a month of beta testing earlier in 2024, Arena Breakout: Infinite now has a solidified release date on the horizon for its early access debut. 


Morefun Studios has confirmed Arena Breakout: Infinite will be released in early access on August 12, 2024, at 7 pm PST / 10 pm ET / 2 am GMT (August 13).  You can pre-load the game a day earlier for an ideal headstart. This is a little more than a month after its closed beta ended on June 28.


The devs didn't reveal any details about the game's full release yet. They have further mentioned players will be able to download the game files from their official website only during the entire early access period.




As a result, the Steam page for Arena Breakout: Infinite will be up the entire time but you won't be able to download the game from Valve's game client. So, if you want to jump back into the immersive tactical extraction FPS this August, downloading from their official website is the only way to go.


The early access will kick off with three maps namely Armory, Farm, and Valley. You can also choose from an arsenal of 48 unique weapons and there will be an all-new realistic climate system that will alternate between sunny and overcast weather conditions. Some other new features include a Kill Cam and an option to spectate.


"There's no wipe planned for now" the devs have confirmed. The primary areas of focus during the early access include "optimization, new features, fine-tuning gameplay mechanics, and balance monetization systems."

Catfish in Fields of Mistria, like they often do in the real world, inhabit the ponds and lakes of Mistria. This does limit where you can find them, but you do still have a couple of options for fishing locations if you want to have a change of scenery. 


The first location is on the Eastern Road (shown above), in the ponds and lakes which are lined by Cattail Fluff. The second is up near the Manor House in Mistria itself, where Adeline and her family live. To the left of the Manor is a pond where you can also find Catfish:

Either way, you might have to spend quite a bit of time fishing before you manage to catch a Catfish. They seem to be on the rarer side of fish in Mistria, so you’re likely to catch a lot of other fish in your efforts. On the plus side, a lot of these fish can be donated to the Museum or otherwise sold for a good of profit. 


Thankfully, there are no weather or time restrictions surrounding Catfish that I’ve noticed, meaning you can catch them at any time of the year, regardless of whether it’s raining, snowing, or the sun is blazing down on you.

While the game currently has certain limitations when it comes to modes, it's pretty well-optimized.

That said, there are certain settings you can tweak to get the best possible performances.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you're wondering what the Spotlight Hour schedule for August 2024 looks like in Pokémon Go, we have got you covered.


In Pokémon Go, Spotlight Hours are weekly events during which the spawn rate of certain Pokémon increases. Along with that, you also get more Candy, Stardust, and XP bonuses. Its regular schedule is every Tuesday, starting at 6 pm and ending at 7 pm in your local time.

Next Pokémon Go Spotlight Hour date and time


The next Pokémon Go Spotlight Hour is on August 13, 2024, between 6 to 7 pm. During this time next week, you'd find Lileep spawning more than usual.

Rainbow Arts' Rendering Ranger: R² is one of the rarest Super Famicom games in existence, but thanks to a partnership between Ziggurat Interactive and Limited Run Games, it's now heading to the Switch and will launch this Winter.
Although initially announced back in 2022, Ziggurat and Limited Run have been fairly quiet on the release since then, but fans can finally get their hands on either a digital version or physical edition later this year, bringing a swift end to the title's long-running scarcity. Originally released in Japan in 1995, only 10,000 copies were made and it quickly became one of the most sought-after console games of all time.

Khaligrad is plenty scrappy. Its edges are rough and you have to figure it out yourself, but it's more intuitive than it appears, and easy to operate once you discern some basics. It's scrappy too in that it's, well. It's Stalingrad. Not really: its world is so fictional it's their 15th century. But the invaders are explicitly fascists and the defenders communists embroiled in a long and brutal semi-guerrilla city war with World War 2 technology. Thankfully, it's stripped of any actual fashy or genocidal play-acting beyond each side doing "hail the empire/union" bits as a sign off.
I think that's why, despite its brutal and difficult setting, it's this year's entry in the long tradition of Low-Intensity Strategy Games For When Hot Why Hot Please Stop You Cannot See My Begging Tears For They Evaporate.

A post on X refers to the latest hotfix as a "calibration" update, which has started rolling out for the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC, which was released back in June. Despite the fact that the base game is largely considered one of the greatest role-playing releases in modern times, the expansion is sitting on a recent review score of "mixed" on Steam. Go figure.




Anyway, here's everything you need to know about the update, which is rolling out to all platforms.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good news for people who only own a PS4 or PS5: Vampire Survivors is finally hitting your favorite – and possibly only – platform. Vampire Survivors arrives on PS4 and PS5 on August 29.


What’s the best way to describe Vampire Survivors to someone who hasn’t experienced it? It’s a game where you glide around big maps while stuff falls out of your pockets and hopefully onto hordes of enemies. You don’t actually do anything to empty your pockets. It just happens automatically, so your job is to avoid touching bad people while also jamming more stuff into your pants. You can play it with one hand.




If you want a more in-depth explanation, I reviewed it when it came out on Switch, then also gave tender critiques to the Emergency Meeting and Operation Guns expansions.


But while this paradigm-shifting game has been available on practically every other platform aside from ones belonging to Sony. Poncle has been working on a port for some time, but it has been held up by Sony’s submission process.


One important thing to note is that the new PlayStation trailer notes that the base Vampire Survivors is the same price as a peri-peri wrap. I’m not sure where they’re getting a peri-peri wrap for $4.99. I call hogwash. Not for quite some time have I witnessed a chicken dispensary offering such a beloved dish for such a low price.


Anyway, Vampire Survivors is available on practically every platform except PS4 and PS5. It will be released for PS4 and PS5 on August 29.

Everything new in Diablo 4 Season 5


Diablo 4 Season 5 is much smaller than normal seasons because it focuses on fixing what came before it, namely the loot system revamp introduced in Season 4. The revamp fixed many issues with loot, but also created several new ones that the developers have decided to tackle with the big update. 


Season 5 is slated to last merely two months instead of the usual length, and that notion sets the stage for how much new content is actually in the season.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After making a mark on several platforms, such as mobile, Xbox, and Playstation, Stumble Guys is ready to launch on Nintendo Switch. The 32-player party royale has officially locked in a date for its Nintendo debut.


After a few months' wait since its February 2024 reveal, here is the release date and pre-order rewards for Stumble Guys on Nintendo Switch.


What is the release date for Stumble Guys on Switch?


Stumble Guys is officially making its Nintendo Switch debut on August 20, 2024. The best way to get access to the game for anyone is through the Nintendo eShop, which will be free after the release. It also supports 10 different languages. You can also pre-order the game, and your reward will be an exclusive Founder's Pack.




Stumble Guys pre-order rewards for Nintendo Switch


Upon pre-order, you can get several rewards from the developer, Scopely. Here is the list of rewards that are in the Founder's Pack:



'Oh Yeah' Victory animation


Hi Sp33d P0rtia Mythic Stumbler


2000 gems



Not only that, you will also be provided with a starter pack, which will contain the following rewards:



'Crimson Skull' Legendary Stumbler


'Skeleton' Footsteps


1600 gems



Does Stumble Guys support cross-progression for Switch?


This game does not support cross-progression for Switch, which means that you cannot play with the same account across different platforms. However, you can play against other players from different platforms, as cross-play is available in this game. 


Not only that, there will be no syncronization in Stumble Pass and store offers between Switch and other platforms at the beginning of the launch. However, you can expect it to get synced in the future.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Murky Energy Residue is an essential resource in crafting characters and catalysts in The First Descendant. You don't get it by research but needs to be farmed and here's how you can do that easily.


You can use the Murky Energy Residue reagent to craft a Stabilizer for Valby as well as the Crystallization Catalyst. The best part about getting this resource is that you don't need to play the game in Hard mode and the farming process is quite simple too.


Screenshot by Destructoid


Best way to farm Murky Energy Residue in The First Descendant


Murky Energy Residue is mostly found in Sterile Land at:



The Forgottense in the Restricted Zone (Southeast corner of Sterile Land)


Unknown Laboratory in the Classified Area (Northwest corner of Sterile Land)



These two POIs are Calling of the Descendant missions where you have to defeat monsters to get these reagent drops. You can fast travel between these points by using either of the temporary or permanent Outposts.


The monsters drop approximately 10x Murky Energy Residues per run, sometimes more, so you'll need to defeat them quite a few times if you want to craft Valby. That's because Valby Stabilizer consumes 40 such reagents during its research process. This means you'll need to defeat this monster at least four times to get enough materials.


Best Descendant to farm Murky Energy Residue


Bunny is the best Descendant to farm Murky Energy Residue. After several trial runs using different Descendants, we found Bunny to be the most suitable candidate as she is fast and can deal splash damage to many enemies at once.


Bunny is also one of the best and least expensive Descendants you can unlock early in the game, so not choosing this character for these runs would be a no-brainer.

Console releases are planned, but unspecified; however, given that CrossCode eventually hit all platforms, including Switch, we're pretty hopeful we'll be playing this on the Switch successor.

I had a co-worker once who said that Wednesdays are best, but that guy is a jerk. Fridays are the best, and that’s because it’s when the Destructoid Changelog Newsletter gets delivered.


The Destructoid Changelog Newsletter is a fascinating look at the site’s weirdest and otherwise hippest new articles for the week. I, personally, hand-pick the ripest word clumps and hurl them at you in one easily digestible wrap. You’ll get a handout of reviews, features, and news that will help add a bit of color to your world. Find out what you missed through the magic of bespoke summaries and hyperlinks.


As a bonus, I’ll tell you about the strangest games I’ve been playing that week. Am I always playing a weird game? You’d probably be surprised. Perhaps even shocked! Maybe even concerned.


It’s completely free and only requires your email address. You have nothing to lose unless you have finite inbox space. Just plop your email address into the designated and well-labeled text box that should be somewhere in the middle of this article to subscribe to another distraction that will help you make it to the weekend.

For the studio's next game, co-founders Raphaël Colantonio and Julien Roby are leaning into comparisons with their old endeavours at Arkane more earnestly. The new game - currently untitled and without a release date - is a first-person sci-fi RPG set in an alternate-1900s North America, which ostensibly combines the ingenuity and gadgetry of Dishonored and Prey with a "real RPG" experience redolent of Skyrim and modern-day Fallout.

This time, two classic Jaleco games have made their way onto the hybrid console courtesy of publisher City Connection: Pinball Quest and Yokai Club, both developed by Tose.
For those unfamiliar, Jaleco was a prominent force in the days of the Famicom, putting out dozens of console and arcade titles as far back as 1982. It would eventually go on to file bankruptcy in 2014 and its assets subsequently transfered over to City Connection. And now here we are!

The new Type-8 Transporter is a medium freighter capable of hauling a maximum of 406 tons of cargo. It's got a default jump range of 17.55 light years and two big prongs sticking out of its face like a sci-fi forklift. Cool. The catch is that this ship can only be bought with real money for now, say the developers. This is part of Frontier's new strategy of having paid-for ships in the game. I don't really play Elite Dangerous anymore, so I don't have strong feelings about that. But I do have strong feelings about the space trucker advertisement the developer has put together for the new ship. Come watch it with me.

We had high hopes for Trinity Fusion after playing it at PAX East two years ago, and we’re happy to say, it doesn’t disappoint. The concept is great. A human-made multiverse — made up of Prime, the Overworld, the Underworld, and the Hyperworld — is collapsing, and the only way to fix it is to merge all of the different worlds back together.
You play as three different versions, called counterselves, of a woman named Maya: Altara, Kera, and Naira. Each comes from a different world and has different abilities. Altara has access to unique ranged weapons thanks to her prosthetic arm and a double jump. Naira can wall jump. And Kera can launch enemies into the air and perform air combos. Everything’s better with air combos.

Still, after messing around with Sliding Hero’s Steam demo, I think this one might have much longer legs than its restrictive-sounding concept suggests. All the better to endlessly slide with.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hurry!
Last month, we reported on the rather sad news that Mushihimesama, the wonderful bullet-hell shmup from developer Cave, would soon be delisted from the Switch eShop.
Well folks, there isn't much time left. Mushihimesama will disappear from the digital storefront later this week on 10th August 2024. If you're on the fence about whether to pick it up before it vanishes into the ether, then perhaps a cool 50% discount will push you over the edge.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Respawn Entertainment introduced a whole new map for players to explore with the release of E-District, their take on a cyberpunk playground. E-District is Apex Legends’ first-ever night map, and it arrives with a new game mode where players automatically respawn the moment they’re eliminated.


Currently, only the trios revival mode is available in Apex Legends, with no duos mode in sight (much to the frustration of some players). E-District was also the only map you could get into when Season 22 launched, but Respawn Entertainment accidentally removed E-District from the rotation pool for ranked games.




Respawn has now put out a statement, announcing that E-District has been added back, but with a catch. Apex Legends players will only get to queue up for ranked games in E-District from August 9 onwards, and this map exclusivity will remain in place until August 12.


After August 12, Apex Legends ranked games will once again operate on a rotational basis with ranked games taking place on Broken Moon, Storm Point, and E-District maps.




This extended duration could help players get more accustomed to the new map’s POIs and figure out rotational plays that can help last longer during ranked games. And with new akimbo weapons in the mix, E-District looks to be the right playground to get used to dual-wielding the likes of P2020 and Mozambique.


Apex Legends Season 22, titled Shockwave, launched on August 6, 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It is I, the wound salter. The injury insult adder. Life By You, the simulation life-em-up from Paradox, was canceled in June after being delayed indefinitely. The day after the cancellation - which Paradox CEO Fredrik Wester implied was down to a “lacking”, unfixable development state - designer Willem Delventhal spoke about his time at the subsequently shuttered Paradox Tectonic. He claimed the team spent a month “in purgatory” prior to being told of the game’s cancelation and studio shuttering two weeks before launch, despite being told by higher-ups that work was “exceeding expectations.”
We’ve now got another look at a game we’ll likely never get, thanks to a thread by Twxbbly user SimMattically collating unseen screenshots from portfolios by several artists who worked on Life By You.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apex Legends Shockwave Season 22 is live now, and it brings a new map among other additions to the game. Among those new features is the introduction of Akimbo weapons mode. This refers to the dual wielding of weapons in Apex Legends, where you have certain weapons in both of your hands to deal damage.


Even though akimbo weapons are fun to use in Apex Legends, there are some things to keep in mind about using two P2020s or two Mozambique together. There are certain buffs and nerfs attached to these combinations. For starters, weapons in akimbo mode turn into automatic weapons, meaning you can just hold onto that trigger and the weapon would continue to fire.


There are no optics available when weapons are in akimbo mode, so you only have the option to hipfire these weapons. To make up for this, Apex Legends players who wish to re-enable optics can holster the second weapon by using the select fire toggle input.

Respawn has added an increased rate of fire and has doubled the magazine size for akimbo weapons. However, there will be a longer reload time (since you have to reload two weapons at the same time). Given that akimbo operates in hipfire mode, looking down sights by aiming will slightly reduce the hipfire spread, so even if there is no optic in place, players shouldn’t forget to aim down sights for better accuracy.


So far, akimbo mode is available only for the P2020 pistol and Mozambique shotgun, making it possible to have two P2020s or two Mozambiques in battle. Akimbo weapons have added a whole new layer to how battles happen in Apex Legends, and while there are only two weapons so far that you can dual-wield, we will perhaps one day get to wield even two Wingman together.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's almost there.
The Switch has been a huge success for Nintendo and it looks like the hybrid system is currently on track to surpass the sales of Sony's PlayStation 2 in the US.
According to an update from Circana's executive director and industry advisor Mat Piscatella, as of June 2024, Switch life-to-date US unit sales are now only 1.1 million units away from the PlayStation 2. The Switch is currently the third best-selling unit of all time in the US (since 1995), placing behind the PS2 and Nintendo DS.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While the standard Worn Tools can serve you well initially, upgrading your materials is crucial to collect more advanced items. This includes Iron Ore, a resource that can be quite challenging to locate. We're here to guide you on where to find Iron Ore in Fields of Mistria and what requirements are needed.


Fields of Mistria Iron Ore farming guide


To obtain Iron Ore in Fields of Mistria, you'll need to venture to Level 21 and beyond in the Mines. A barrier will block your path to this level, which you can overcome by unlocking the Water Seal with a few specific ingredients. Collecting a Ruby, Lantern Moth, Stone Loach, and Upper Mines Mushroom will grant you access to the area.

Before you go off into the Mines, ensure to bring a lot of stamina resources to reach the higher levels. The Full Restore spell can be excellent for this, as well as the Stamina Syrup from Valen's Clinic. You may want to pick up some healing remedies, too, just in case an enemy comes knocking at your door.


Once you've unlocked the Mines Level 21 in Fields of Mistria, use a Copper Pickaxe to mine the Iron Ores. Treasure chests and digging spots also provide more of this resource, spawning a whole bundle.


If you have some money to spare, you can purchase Iron Ore and other materials at the Blacksmith's Shop. Balor's Wagon occasionally has Iron Ingots, but they cost 300 Tesserae. With enough resources, you can upgrade your tools and expand their charging range. Additionally, Iron Ingots can be used during the Repair the General Store quest, which will be unlocked during the game's later stages.

The Episode quietly delivered a secret world boss encounter to Nessus, rewarding Radiolite and two Triumphs. However, before players can test themselves against the encounter, they'll have to complete several prior steps that involve the seasonal story and the new Battlegrounds.


Though Destiny 2 has shed its seasons for episodes, content and structure have initially appeared pretty consistent between the two models. Typically, alongside narrative missions and seasonal activities, a given Season (and now Episode) will hide a few secrets that lead to hidden encounters (like the Whetstone Exotic mission).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Epic Games will soon stop locking items forever within Fortnite Battle Passes, which may hopefully curb the FOMO feeling that often comes with live-service games. But there's a catch (of course). Fortnite Battle Pass items won't appear in the Fortnite Store for 18 months after the pass expires. 


It's not the only catch. In the announcement from developer Epic Games, not all items in a Battle Pass will appear in the store after the time limit expires. 


"Shop selection is dependent on a variety of factors, and there is no guarantee that a Battle Pass item will come to the Shop after this change goes into effect," Epic explains in a Q&A. "If an item in a future Battle Pass will never be available outside the Pass, we’ll let you know!" Rough.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Morel Mushroom is one of the rarest ingredients in Fields of Mistria, typically only spawning in a select few locations. Fortunately, there are two ways to obtain this particular item, and we're here to show you what needs to be done.


Where to find Morel Mushrooms in Fields of Mistria


You can find Morel Mushrooms in The Narrows and the Beach during the Spring. They also appear in Balor's Wagon, where they can be purchased for 100 Tesserae each. If you want to get them for free, look around the riverside of The Narrows. 


Screenshot by Destructoid


I spotted one of them up above the Mine's entrance; however, this can only be accessed after completing the Beautification Project.


Screenshot by Destructoid


In addition to the Narrows, some players have discovered the Morel Mushroom next to the lighthouse at the Beach. Unfortunately, they aren't guaranteed to spawn here, but you can at least try to look here daily.


Since Morel Mushrooms are incredibly rare in Fields of Mistria, I highly recommend waiting for them at Balor's Wagon. Regardless of the current season, they'll eventually appear in the shop's Forageables section. Those who don't see them in Balor's inventory will likely need to wait a few days. This shop's selection changes daily, so keep checking it while entering Mistria.


You can cook the mushrooms and create recipes for stamina and health. In addition to meals, they can be donated to the museum or given to a villager upon request. Romanceable characters like Juniper also enjoy Morel Mushrooms as a gift, improving relationship levels in return.

Regardless of whether you became interested in romancing March the moment you met him or consider him a second choice after his brother Olric, knowing his gift preferences can help you win his heart quickly.


March's loved gifts in Fields of Mistria


Since March is the town's local blacksmith, he's all about having free ores to make his job easier. While regular ores will still make him happy, perfect versions are where you'll really elicit a reaction, especially if you save your gifts for his birthday on Spring 16.

Sega has released its Q1 financial report for the three months ending 30th June 2024, and while net sales are down 3.2% year-on-year, the company's entertainment division (which includes video games) is up 34% (via GamesIndustry.biz).
A large part of this increase has been attributed to the developer's acquisition of Rovio, the maker of the hugely popular Angry Birds franchise. Sega acquired the company back in August 2023, and it seems to have given it a bit of a boost this quarter, where it made 8.7 billion yen.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A great vacation, or Natsu much?
In a world where problems and frustrations seem to be around every corner, you might find yourself wanting to escape from it all. Maybe you dream of taking in the Japanese countryside, strolling around in a field of sunflowers, catching some bugs, fishing, all without a worry in sight. Well, if that’s what you’re looking for, and you don’t mind muddy textures, a little funky translation, and blocky 3D models, then this is just the game for you.
Natsu-Mon: 20th Century Summer Kid takes place in Japan right around the turn of the millennium. August 1999, to be exact. You play as 10-year-old Satoru, who’s traveling with his circus-owning parents, and since you’re only a kid, you aren't performing and instead have all the free time in the world for the 31 days the circus is in town. Each day follows roughly the same structure. Wake up, eat breakfast, do morning stretches, and then you’re free to do what you please until 5pm, when dinner-munching commences, and afterward, you’ll also have some nightlife hours before you enter dreamland.

Other measures are designed to improve voice actor working conditions, and stop companies using their voices and likeness as fuel for generative AI tools without their consent. It's both a praiseworthy endeavour and an interesting breakdown of the voice-actor's trade.

No matter how you come across it — whether by following the Geoglyph sidequest or simply stumbling upon it by chance — it's a magical moment, and gives you one of the best swords in the game. But what if we told you there was a way to make it even better...?
Fans have managed to find a way to make the Master Sword "unbreakable" via an extremely long and convoluted process of glitches, and YouTuber El Duende 05 has documented the steps in an hour-long video. Yes, an hour (thanks, ReadWrite!).

The generational uplift is very compelling, even in single-threaded Linux workloads shooting ahead of Intel's 14th Gen Core competition, across nearly 400 benchmarks these new Zen 5 desktop CPUs impress, and these new Zen 5 desktop processors are priced competitively. I was already loving the Ryzen 7000 series performance on Linux with its AVX-512 implementation and performing so well across hundreds of different Linux workloads but now with the AMD Ryzen 9000 series, AMD is hitting it out of the ball park. That paired with the issues Intel is currently experiencing for the Intel Core 13th/14th Gen CPUs and the ~400 benchmark results makes this a home run for AMD on the desktop side with only some minor Linux caveats.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sail the high Ys.
If you've played an Ys game before, you know that our red-haired hero Adol Christin is pretty partial to a boat. He's also partial to a shipwreck or three. Adol's very first adventure in Ys I starts off with his boat being destroyed by a storm; Ark of Napishtim opens with Adol washed up on the beach; and in Lacrimosa of Dana, his ship is attacked by a sea serpent.
Adol is hit by sea disasters so frequently that it's joked about both in-game and by the community; there's no way we're getting on a boat with Adol, even if it's just a raft. But in Ys X: Nordics, that's exactly what you have to do — not just get on the boat with him, but enhance it, control it, and crew it. How did Nihon Falcom manage to go 35 years without giving us the helm of a ship?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Heads up!
If you're anything like us, then chances are you've been replaying Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty on and off for nearly 25 years. Yet despite this, it seems that new things are still being discovered in Hideo Kojima's 2001 stealth masterpiece.
Take those pesky guards, for instance. MGS2 offers up a smorgasbord of options to avoid or take out your enemies, including tranquilising them in the gonads, distracting them with noise, or straight up somersaulting into them. One player has found out, however, that if you're particularly determined to complete a non-lethal run of the game, you can recruit a few seagulls to send your foes packing (thanks, Automaton).

This is not the murmuring of some poor sod on a nineteen-hour Dota 2 binge who’s started thinking that the crumbs in his keyboard resemble a viable snack, but a bold new reality, one I recently found myself staring down during a trip to Asda. The supermarket chain – third biggest in the UK by turnover and purveyors of ill-fitting clothes and surprisingly good doughnuts alike – has added light-up gaming mice, keyboards, and headsets to its mountain of own-brand wares.
Asda being what it is (Americans, if you’re unfamiliar, think Walmart with less gun violence), it’s all dirt cheap as well. £17 for a full-size keyboard. £16 for an FPS mouse. Overwhelmed with curiosity, I ended up taking home a complete starter set (keeb, different mouse, headset, and mousemat) for £45, or about a third of the price of the Logitech G515 Lightspeed TKL that I’d shortly kick off my desk. Could this be a new frontier in affordable PC hardware, bringing tech to the masses in a way no specialist retailer ever could, or should supermarkets stick to cereal and meal deals? Surely the Asda Tech (real name) 4-in-1 Gaming Kit would have the answers.

As of the game’s latest hotfix blog, we’ve now got a better idea when we’ll start seeing some of these “smaller bits and pieces.” Bits and pieces? In this economy? Yes, and this month in fact. “Late August” to be precise by quoting a vague statement precisely.

I'm pretty sure not having eight gigs of RAM is heretical, but never fear, you can probably compensate by taking a leaf from the God-Emperor's book and arrange for a host of dying psykers to pour their brain energy into your motherboard.
All of which is to say that Focus Home have released the system requirements for huge-shouldered action game Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2. Find them proudly emblazoned across the header image above, and written out for easier copy-pasting in the blockquote, below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As the wait lengthens for Hollow Knight: Silksong, other Soulsy creature features are scurrying to fill the breach. We had Deviator last week - now, it's time for a bumper helping of the heebie-jeebies in the shape of Perennial Order. The title makes it sound like an eBay delivery of potted geraniums. The game festering beneath is actually a "plant horror" boss rusher with twin stick melee controls, unlockable "Instinct" abilities and one-hit deaths.
In a gift to headline writers everywhere, the developers, four-person Gardenfiend Games, are calling it "Hollow Knight meets Titan Souls", and who am I to deny them? It's got one of those "painterly" art styles, too, though other words come to mind, such as "rotted" and "unhallowed" and "manky". It's out on 6th September. Find a trailer nested below this paragraph like a venus flytrap poised to clamp around your fingers.

Because today developers Paradox revealed the ins and outs of another feature from the DLC that is way more exciting than some fusty old Greeks. It's called "landless adventurers" and it'll let you play as disgraced dirtbag travelling the world in a sort of medieval gig economy. You'll be making camp, gathering followers, taking random jobs from local rulers, and catching infectious diseases as you try to travel safely through war-torn regions. It sounds amazing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Horka polevila, ale žár nadšení Strahováků z techniky nepolevuje! Za poslední měsíc se stalo několik událostí doslova kosmického charakteru. Došlo k úspěšnému startu a vypuštění sond z rakety Ariane 6, Boeing vyslal Starliner na oběžnou dráhu, kde nyní jeho pasažéři neplánovaně už druhý měsíc setrvávají. KiCAD má novou verzi a blíží se konference k jeho dalšímu vývoji. Objevil se nový čip kombinující RP2040 s ethernetem a povedlo se na čipu vytvořit pulzní safírové lasery. Jsou vám tyto novinky málo? Pak jsou na Virtuální Bastlírnu připravená i obecnější hardwarová témata!

Za HW lze probrat zajímavé nově objevené parazitní jevy v SiC MOSFETech, jak se dá operační zesilovač "zaseknout" nebo k čemu jsou dobré ztrátové koaxiální kabely a kde je sehnat. Samozřejmě bastlíři narazili i na kuriozity, například doutnavkovou logiku nebo plošňák, jehož součástí je ohýbačka na THT součástky.

Software ani tentokrát nezůstane stranou - kromě již zmíněné nové verze KiCADu se dá podívat na stavbu linuxového managovaného switche, NanoKVM, převod videa z DisplayPortu na eink nebo emulátor NESu na Picopadu.

Jak je zvykem, s postupem večera se jistě přejde i k lehce bizarním tématům - kupříkladu, co provedl CrowdStrike, jak zprovoznit Doom na erotických hračkách pro pány, jak vypadá nestandardní 12V USB nebo jak se ztrácí některé části audio záznamů z CD, protože je většina SW neumí správně přečíst.

Příští Virtuální Bastlírna se pod taktovkou projektu MacGyver studentského klubu SiliconHill bude konat ve středu 7. srpna od 20:00 minimálně do 22:00 (ale obvykle končí o dost později). Odkaz na konferenci se před samotnou akcí objeví na bastlířské wiki.]]></summary>

Still: I've skinned and filleted enough COD in my time to know that Black Ops 6's new "omnimovement" system is going to ruffle as many feathers as it smooths. The short version is that it turns you into Max Payne.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In his Vampire Survivors review, Matt Cox described the game as something he could play with "one hand in a packet of crisps". I think about this quite often, actually, as someone whose largely offline friends (or Fortnite/FIFA pals) ask me to recommend them a game that's good or interesting. Show them something popular like Elden Ring and, despite its grandeur, it might prove too much in all facets. But Vampire Survivors? It's an easy sell: simple, digestible, ridiculous value.
All of this is to say, One BTN Bosses is from the same school of the easy sell. You can fight bosses with one hand in a packet of pickled onion Space Raiders, after all.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You’re dead at the start of rhythm-combat  RPG Nocturne, just arrived in some sort of afterlife waiting room after the apparent extinction of humanity. You get your bearings, and you soon meet up with another, only slightly irritating, small child. His name is Kimothy, which sounds like something you’d only say as a joke to annoy friends named Kim, and then only once because it would be stupid to say it again. It’s fine! Leaves flutter, rays of sun cavort through trees, and the music is utterly gorgeous. The game opens on twinkly piano and mournful strings, infused with a good dose of stirring JRPG whimsy, and soon transforms into whatever the genre of music is called that makes you want to immediately go on a massive adventure. Potion-punk. Slime-swing. Limit breakcore etc.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Is early adoption a chump’s game? I dunno about that, though between the Asus ROG Ally X and the Steam Deck OLED, those who stayed their hand on their earlier handheld gaming PC counterparts do have a couple of quality second-genners to choose from. Valve’s effort manages to wring multiple performance, design, and battery life improvements out of its new display, while the ROG Ally X makes similar upgrades with a bigger-yet-better take on the original ROG Ally.
The only thing to do, clearly, is make them fight. It’s probably in the Irish Code Duello or something: "Should one portable games box impugn another’s honour by releasing shortly after it, satisfaction must be claimed through a comparison article." My hands are bound here, folks, though if you yourself have been playing the waiting game on a handheld purchase, perhaps this little head-to-head can help you pick the right one.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cinematic platformer Bionic Bay opens on a scene of a very large egg doing very bad things - easily my third favourite genre of speculative fiction. You awake to a world of tree trunks that twist like viscera and corroded contraptions powered by luminous goop that’s stored in the balls, uh, big glass orbs. A beam of light soon fills your character with newfound vigour, which is a nice moment of triumph in what otherwise feels like a deeply oppressive rust pit, all unsteady platforms and jagged pipes.
It doesn’t take long before you start spotting examples of the reason Bionic Bay went viral earlier this week. Above your head hangs a painstakingly detailed mass of vents and cables, looming lifelike with dust and shadow and history. I stood and stared because I’d seen how the sausage was made, but I like to think I would have lingered longer than usual anyway. It really is just that impressive.

I randomly watched one of Stay/Night's many anime spin-offs, Fate Zero, during the pandemic lockdowns.

As such, I think I'm the nearest thing RPS has to a Fate "expert". Join me for a brief and sporadically informed tour of a universe that has Shaped The Culture like few others.

When the press got wind of it, the major countered that "everyone was happy", which is hard to argue with, especially since there are no official cinemas nearby.

As a result, telecoms regulator AGCOM has summoned Google and Cloudflare to an official meeting to hear all about their plans to defeat piracy. The Italian Competition and Market Authority recently launched an antitrust investigation against Google, so the meeting in September will take place under dark clouds.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the neat things about Norland's fantasy medievalism is that specialist knowledge is tied to characters. So if there's only one person in your village who knows how to brew tastier beer, and they die after being freakishly savaged by a passing wolf (it happens), suddenly your village will have no artisanal lager master. The results may be devastating. Luckily, you can share knowledge in a number of ways - by copying books, or having "wise conversations". The exception to this is child characters, whose pea-sized brains can't learn specialist knowledge, only soaking up basic attributes like "manners" from the teachers you assign to them. Well, until now. The developers for the Rimworld-meets-Crusader Kings catastrophe simulator have made kids a little smarter. They'll now learn more important things from their adult teachers.

It seems just yesterday I was getting very jealous at Matthew Castle (RPS in peace) for getting to preview the sequel to my beloved Shadows Of Amn. Fast forward several turns, Larian’s RPG banger is officially one year old since release, and there’s now a much higher chance that strangers at pubs will understand why my failed romance with Jaheira as a youth was such a deeply heartbreaking experience. Baldur’s Gate 3 itself looks to be done and dusted following the upcoming patch, but Larian now seem to be gearing up for their next charm offensive with a new “community focused” YouTube channel, as well as further teasing their two games currently in development.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've never learned to drive, but every so often a well-meaning friend tells me I'd be good at it, because 'look, Edwin, you play all those driving games, surely they've taught you the basics'. Friend, here is what driving games have taught me: traffic lights are there for regional flavour; drifting is the same thing as cornering; other cars exist to serve as bumper cushions when overshooting a turn. Certainly, nobody wants a guy whose ideas about automobiles come from 2018's Wreckfest to be involved in the school run. On which note: THQ Nordic have just announced Wreckfest 2 - a fresh helping of destruction derby with fancified visuals and newly animate drivers who flinch and gesticulate when other drivers smash into them. Witness the carnage in the announcement trailer below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's a hell of a thing to showcase a remake weeks after kiboshing the developers of the original game. In early July, Gothic creators Piranha Bytes were reportedly shuttered as part of Embracer Group's mad race to trim costs, following their decade-long acquisition binge. Watching THQ Nordic's new Gothic Remake trailer, below, feels a little like watching a vivisectionist parade about in somebody else's skin. Still, the remake's developers Alkimia Interactive aren't to blame for Embracer's fuck-ups, and I am selfishly happy to see Gothic return as an Unreal Engine 5 production - even if I didn't play the original back in 2001.


Sin did play the original game, and in her 2016 retrospective, she paints an absorbing picture of a dark fantasy "microsociety" in which every community "has a reason to exist, a means of providing for itself, a social order, and a long term goal". It's a setup that reminds me of my beloved Roadwarden, even as the sight of grumpy lizards slinking through undergrowth has me silently mouthing "fus roh dah".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Titan Quest 2! Now there's a name you can set your watch by. No colons, no bespoke jargon, no tortuous subtitles like "Gaia's B.O.U.N.T.Y." or "Hyperion's Wild Rumpus" - just the steadying prospect of a titanic quest that, who knows, may involve actual titans. The action-RPG beneath the moniker appears similarly straightforward: it's about following a plot thread through a mythological world in top-down view, smashing Ancient Greek giga-crabs and the like to obtain shinier, pointier varieties of gear. I'm sure I don't need to tell you that there's an endgame in which you farm monsters for crafting materials.


Like Pandora opening her box, but without the accompanying tidal wave of sickness, curses and death, THQ Nordic have released a new trailer that talks you though all of this in detail. Here it is...

Both Noseworthy and Smith appear to have lost their jobs in the course of Bungie's brutal cost-cutting this week, but Payback's cancellation pre-dates the layoffs. Envisaged as a Destiny spin-off, rather than Destiny 3, it was apparently dropped "a while ago".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The first World Of Goo was a cheerful parade of goopy engineering with a sense of never-ending novelty (well, never-ending for about four hours). Every level would introduce a new goo type or a twist on the basic bridge-building puzzle that challenged you to get a gaggle of gurgling balls to the nearest pipe. World Of Goo 2 pursues that sense of novelty with just as much twitchy eagerness as its predecessor, throwing new toys and goos at the player in an effort to keep you on your sludge-coated toes. That pursuit doesn't always result in pleasing new levels, though. There is a "hit and miss" feeling to things this time around. But those hits are hits. For anyone who has spent the last 16 years yearning for more sticky structure-building: I hope you like comically unpredictable fluids.

Now that Valve have shown it’s possible to quickly turn around an upgraded handheld without enraging owners of the original, Lenovo have hinted at a new Legion Go, MSI have revealed an improved Claw, and Asus have released this here ROG Ally X. A ROG Ally, again – but better? Yes, it is, in almost every way except the speed at which it’ll plunge you into financial destitution.

The Cuphead influence runneth so overly that it feels trite to even point it out, and I do think maybe opting for different music would have served it far better in this case, but you can’t deny that Ghosts n’ Goblins lance throw.

Now Mountaintop Studios, a new studio whose ranks include ex-Bungie and Respawn devs, have chucked themselves into the tactical FPS gauntlet with Spectre Divide. Made with input from former CS pro and streamer Shroud, it looks a bit like a mix of CS and Valorant, but has a big gimmick that sets it apart from the two: you can swap between two bodies. I… am cautiously optimistic? I think?

The latest cuts were necessary to prevent continued losses, says the report, after Bungie missed Sony’s targets following the release of last year’s Lightfall.

Suno and Udio are welcoming discovery, noting that the law has always permitted comparable uses of copyrighted works.

Well, I got up this morning and made a small suburban village with a hospital, school, police station and a cafe in the space of 20 minutes. This is the backwater burg of Edwitherington. Population: 8 - one for every non-residential building in town. Major imports: ornamental lampposts, because I like to cultivate an old-timey mood. Major exports: traffic jams, because I've laid out my village in the form of a small crescent leading back to the freeway, which means that there are two traffic light junctions about 100 metres apart.

It got shut down last year as Activision focused their efforts elsewhere, making the map unplayable. But you can now revisit those bullet-strewn beaches. In theory, anyway. Activision have released it as a 4GB open-source project that can be explored in a 3D model-viewing tool. That's cool. But among their reasons for doing so, there lies a predictably grubby logic: they want people to use the data to train AI.

In my brief time with massive Fallout 4 mod Fallout London, I’ve read a delightful terminal entry about a scientist who named his favourite radiated shrew “Big Dave,” thwacked several of said Radshrews with a walking stick, gulped down some expired pink wafers, and been informed of train delays due to “leaves on the track.”
“A British transport joke!” I said to myself, marinating in the sufficient amount of crown-mandated mild amusement. “Our organ-floggingly expensive yet vital public services are crap!” I was having a good time. Then the game public transported me straight to my desktop, and continued to do so at regular intervals over the next few hours, ranging from “just as this conversation was getting good” to “just as my save was about to load.” My upper lip almost quivered, I tell you.

Happily, I didn’t spot any bear mascots in Planet Coaster 2’s new deep dive trailer.

The list is enormous and designed expressly around improved replayability - take that, Las Vegas Dome.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In case you skipped the headline, I’ll repeat myself. Among the wonderful sights contained in space-poking adventure game The Great Fluctus are: beans, slug milk, alien volleyball, egg arguments, and massive frog. Additional screenshots suggest this frog later acquires wings. Like a captive Generation Game host, I am helpless but to shout out more incredible sights as they flutter past on the conveyor belt of pure flippin' videogame before me. It’s got dance parties with horrible gorilla aliens. It’s got building, namely the Statue Of Liberty out of goop, just as George Washington’s goop clone intended. It’s also got just sitting on a bench, enjoying some lovely serene space scenery.  Feast your famished face on the trailer.

Specifically, laidback intercity services with nobody else in the quiet car and certainly, none of those screeching smaller bipeds, or "children" as they are scientifically known. That idyll is now lost to me thanks to Covid: I have vulnerable family members and continue to be careful about social distancing. As such I spend most train journeys these days lurking between carriages, trolling the door sensors and scowling furiously at anybody who visits the loo. But now, thanks to the obscene magic of video games, I can get my fill of authorial locomotivation once again.

In a pastime that’s had several decades to perfect the art of hitting men with sharp objects, that’s quite the accomplishment. Since releasing in 2022, Torn Banner have lavished the player base with free horses, angry peasants, and most recently, the Regicide update - hosting a climatic tete-a-tete between two angry crownmen. With work on No More Room In Hell 2 well underway though, Torn Banner have decided to call it on Chiv 2, which they now consider “feature complete.”

Original story:
Earlier this month it was reported that Skibidi Toilet, the YouTube phenomenon, may be heading to film and television via director Michael Bay. Now Invisible Narratives, a production company co-owned by Bay, has apparently sent a DMCA takedown notice to Garry Newman, citing the large number of Skibidi Toilet games and assets advertised within Garry's Mod.

Skibidi Toilet uses assets derived from Half-Life 2, however, and owes a lot to the Garry's Mod machinima scene. And the animation's original creator, best known as DaFuqBoom, is claiming innocence over the DMCA.

Whereas AMD’s first take on driver-level frame generation – the same kind of framerate-roiding image generation trickery that FSR 3 and DLSS 3 are based around – came yoked to a barrel of jittering, stuttering, and visual artefacting issues, Fluid Motion Frames 2 is as smooth and you’d like. Without compromising on the ability to deploy it in theoretically any DirectX 11- or 12-based game, too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[British comedy is too often defined by its relationship to America: either as merely irony and sarcasm, which we're told Americans don't understand, or as a sprightly ideas factory for works such as The Office, which Americans can bless by re-making at scale.

Peel back the curtains of American cultural hegemony however and you may find the true pulsing core of British comedy that lies beneath: innuendo. No American network is in a bidding war to import Vic and Bob or remake Bottom, and Carry On and Benny Hill are assumed to be anachronisms in our modern times, but Thank Goodness You're Here! enters the conversation with a nudge and a wink. It's a cheeky 2-3 hour adventure through a small northern town, and it's here to educate the entire world of our nation's obsession with sausages and bare bottoms.

I enjoy the militant reductiveness of this character motivation. There are sprawling underground ecosystems to discover, yes, weird plants to harvest, fractious clumps of tentacles to appraise, avoid or slaughter. But all of these things are contemptible details to be swept up and bagged and thrown in the dumpster.

Well, Enshrouded may provide some or none of these experiences, but what its latest update does is capture their spirit. You'll now be able to choose from several difficulty presets to dampen or spice up the game's challenge. Otherwise, there's new customisation options and some quality of life tweaks, too.

He's the presenter of Krypta FM - pronounced with the chopped staccato of every good radio announcer as Kryp! Ta! FM! - and you are his eager listener and hopeful protege. Sniff the evening air. Breathe deep! The small town world that lies sleeping all around you is just teeming with cryptids, surely. Anyone seen a mothman lately? A werewolf?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Overwatch 2 director Aaron Keller has posted a lengthy blog on Steam about the transition from 6v6 player matches in the first Overwatch to 5v5 in the poorly received free-to-play sequel. It's a juicy read for armchair designers and lapsed Overwatchers like myself, packing in analysis of class roles and the shift from the free choice of heroes to single hero picks and enforced team compositions.
In broad strokes, Keller summarises how the Overwatch experience has drifted away from "player freedom and creativity in order to create a more balanced, consistent and competitive experience for players". It's possible, however, that Overwatch 2 will swing back in the other direction, as Blizzard are now "exploring how we can test different forms of 6v6 in the game to gauge the results", with a view to restoring some of the joyful chaos that saw entire teams of Reinhardts charging the objective in formation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The story of Mortal Kombat games in recent years has been a mish-mash of double-crosses, weird friendships, and alternate dimension wobbles. They often feel like a casualty of Marvel movie bloat. Mortal Kombat 1 was marketed as a "reboot", for example, but is really just a continuation of previous nonsense, with developers NetherRealm saying "I don't know, stick a multiverse in it." Yet from that multiverse now arrives another bad guy, bringing new story chapters for the fighting game's first big expansion, as well as extra characters like the liquid metal murderer from Terminator 2, a Conan of the barbarian persuasion, and the masked killer of the Scream movies.

Sorry, America! Anyway, let's have a looksie at the PC game release sheets.

Thus far, Eyeo GmbH, the company behind Adblock Plus, has come out on top. However, with Axel Springer's reformulated claims now rooted firmly in copyright law, the stakes are high at Germany's highest court. A long-running lawsuit involving Sony and a cheat device may yet hold the answers.
