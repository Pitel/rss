My dad used to tell me that, when he was young, the world was in black and white. For a long time, I didn't think to question it - after all, every shred of historical evidence we had from the 1950s and before was in black and white, too. Unfortunately, I grew up, and realised that my dad - as all dads are wont to do - was pulling my leg. Still, I could never quite imagine the past as anything more than sepia-toned, even when poring over colourised photos and videos from bygone eras.

We could argue all day about which Zelda is technically the best. In fact, we often do, especially with the 35th Anniversary of the series this year. But no matter how many times we yell at each other that Majora's Mask is better than Ocarina of Time, or that Oracle of Ages and Seasons are underrated, there can be no definitive ranking.

The Nintendo community is a tight community. It is a community of joy that is shared online and at events. One of the community's most loving, energetic, and hard-working members was Bobby Pauls – also known as The Nintendo Guru. After a long-fought battle in the hospital with COVID-19, Bobby Pauls sadly passed away on Friday, February 26th, 2021.
I was fortunate enough to share many great moments with Bobby online as part of his streaming channels on YouTube and Twitch, as well as in person at E3 in 2018. I have very fond memories of Bobby’s Splatoon 2 streams, his frequent Nintendo news updates, and interviews he would do with personalities from the Nintendo community. He always brought his “A game”.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After tackling Metroid in Season 1, the second season of Game Informer's Video Gameography podcast moves on to one of the biggest shooter franchises in existence: Halo. This week, we examine Bungie's blockbuster Halo 2.
Halo 2 was released on the original Xbox on November 9, 2004, and it was an even bigger success than the original. The lead-up to Halo 2 was full of anticipation, but its development was anything but easy. For the next hour as we talk about Halo's massive lore, the Arbiter's secret origins, Bungie's original grand plans for multiplayer, and how the studio was almost forced to release Halo 2 several years early.
Join hosts Ben Reeves (@BenjaminReeves), Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), and former Game Informer video editor Wade Wojcik (@WadeWojcik) as we unpack the history and impact of Master Chief's grand sequel.  And for more Halo, be sure to check out our definitive ranking of every Halo game.
Check out the rest of our podcast on the Video Gameography hub. If you'd like to get in touch with the Video Gameography podcast, you can email us at podcast@gameinformer.com. You can also join our official Game Informer Discord server by linking your Discord account to your Twitch account and subscribing to the Game Informer Twitch channel.

Well, here we are. Eight months after The House In Fata Morgana's release, and six months since our first diary entry of "the game better than Breath of the Wild", it's finally time to actually, finally review it.
Fata Morgana is an subject of bafflement, a tantalising enigma, and a frequent point of mockery, all because its Metacritic score (which was a perfect 100, and is now a measly 97) elevated it into being described as "one of the best games of all time" on Switch. This placed it alongside such classics as the aforementioned Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Super Mario Odyssey, and Hades. PC Gamer included it in their latest "Top 100 PC Games" in September. Visual novel fans already knew this, of course — it's well-reviewed for a reason — but anyone outside of that genre sphere was left to wonder how good an anime visual novel could actually be, and point out that Fata Morgana's high score comes from just nine critic reviews, as opposed to the dozens those games above have to their names. There has to be a catch, right?

GoldenEye 007 has been back in the news lately. We've known for a long time that Rare planned an Xbox Live Arcade remake of the acclaimed shooter and, courtesy of Youtuber Graslu00, we recently got a full look at what that could have looked like. Since then, several people have managed to get their hands on the leaked remaster and play it themselves, either on modded Xbox 360 systems or via emulation.

So, this is Christmas. And what have you done?

Over the holidays we're republishing some of our best features, interviews, opinion pieces and talking points from the previous 12 months from staff and contributors alike — articles that we feel represent our best of 2021. In them you'll find our usual mix of thoughtfulness, frivolity, retro expertise, gaming nostalgia, and — of course — enthusiasm for all things Nintendo. Enjoy!

On 20th January 2021, Nintendo artist, designer, producer and director Takaya Imamura posted his first ever tweet announcing that he was leaving the company after 32 years. Imamura isn't retiring — he's only 54 — but his departure signals the end of an impressive Nintendo career spanning the 16-bit era to Switch.

Ho ho ho! Yes, the most wonderful holiday of the year has officially arrived and it's time to start cracking out the sweetmeats, beverages, and — if you're reading this — video games. It's Christmas!
Following on from an all-round miserable 2020, this year has been... well, not a whole lot better really. COVID-19 restrictions continue to come and go and come again in many places around the globe, and it's looking like things will continue in a similar vein as we head into 2022 in a week's time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Book of Boba Fett arrives on Disney+ on December 29, but you don't have to wait that long to play as the feared bounty hunter in Fortnite. He was added to the store today, sporting his new look from the forthcoming streaming series.
If you purchase just the Boba skin, you'll also get his Z-6 jetpack, as well an emote where he using his targeting computer. You can also separately purchase his starship (formerly named Slave One) as a glider, and his gaffi stick as a harvesting tool. You can get everything together in a bundle should you want it all.
If you can survive a sarlacc pit, nothing’s impossible!

December 25, 2021
Boba isn't the only Star Wars character in Fortnite today. While it's a bummer he's the only new face from The Book of Boba Fett, Epic Games did bring back the previously released imperial storm trooper skin, along with a Y-Wing glider, and a dark side emote.
There's a chance more characters from this series will appear in Fortnite over time, but for now, we'll just have to use the new renter of Jabba's Palace. Unlike Fortnite's release of The Mandalorian content last year, Boba Fett's arrival doesn't add new missions or armor upgrades – it's just the skin and themed accessories.
Epic updates Fortnite's store every day with new content at 4 p.m. PT. We're still waiting for Matrix skins, which we believe will be coming after the recently added emotes and glider, but there's a chance that's all we'll get. Epic may be moving on to Star Wars and other properties in the days ahead. We'll have to wait to see what comes next.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Those who enjoy gaming have their reasons for loving the hobby. Still, one prevailing thing that keeps us coming back to keyboards and controllers is the ability of video games to take us to new worlds, introduce us to new characters, and ultimately tell us stories that stay with us long after the credits roll. Maybe someone’s looking to explore a fantasy realm to get away from what might be a more mundane setting here on Earth. Perhaps someone feels homesick and wants to visit a game world that happens to be their old stomping grounds.
Games can even take us to different time periods and seasons, too. Here are some of our favorite games that take place during the holidays.

The year is 1999. I'm in a GAME, in Loughborough town centre. The grey carpet is sticky, the awful fluorescent lights are so dim I can barely see, and everything sort of smells like stale sweat. I'm standing in the N64 section with my brother, both of us clutching a small fortune in pocket money, browsing games that we know nothing about, because we don't know that reviews exist yet. We are children, and our buying habits tend to be dictated by whichever colours are brightest, and what we can actually reach.

It's a list we will be updating as often as games worthy of inclusion release. We will kick games off and add new ones as the Switch's library grows.
Please note that while the list below contains 10 entries, we aren’t actually ranking them – if a game has made it this far (and managed to stay here), it’s a must-play, period. As such, we’ll be listing entries in reverse chronological order. Also, you’ll find a rundown of previous entries at the bottom of the list. While those titles have gotten bumped for bigger and better experiences, they are still all great games in their own right and…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Our team's picks for the year's finest games.
As 2021 comes to an end there's plenty of gaming to reflect upon. It was a relatively busy year from Nintendo as it kept up momentum for the Switch, which added the OLED model and continues to be a top-seller.
The year started with Nintendo's first-party slate looking relatively quiet, but that was rapidly fixed with a steady flow of releases big and small, with some ports thrown in to fill gaps. All told we were kept busy and there were a few huge releases from the big N, while third-parties also did their bit. There were a few notable big 'uns from Capcom, SEGA and Atlus, as examples, while the eShop continued to serve up a lot of the finest Indie games.

#1 Deku Tree – Why does the Deku tree outrank every other tree in gaming? Because it’s from The Legend of Zelda, and The Legend of Zelda is like the coolest thing ever. Haven’t you heard? Everything Zelda related should be ranked number one. That’s how journalism works. Also, the Deku Tree has a mustache. Double win.

#2 Teldrassil – The old world tree from World Of Warcraft is home to the Night Elves. Of course, the Night Elves suck because they are part of the Alliance, so we weren’t going to include Teldrassil. However, then we heard that sometimes stupid Night Elf noobs fall off the tree and die, so we moved this tree up to number two…]]></summary>

Persona 5 (and its Royal expansion) is easily one of my favorite games of all time. The limited details surrounding the next game’s narrative, combat, and music have forced superfans like me to make their own wishlists. So, here are six – that’s right, six! – features I’d like to see in Persona 6:

While Wrestling Empire is no critical darling, sole developer Mat Dickie is used to that reception, having been making his own professional wrestling games since 2000. Despite unusual visuals and unpredictable gameplay, these titles have achieved a cult following – it's not a huge leap from the suspension of disbelief required to enjoy wrestling to the suspension of disbelief required to enjoy Wrestling Empire.

It's an old chestnut now. Way back in 2006 it was disappointing — if not surprising — that Mother 3 wasn't brought to the West, but after Lucas came to Super Smash Bros. in 2015 it seemed like a foregone conclusion that we'd see the third part of the EarthBound trilogy officially localised at some point.
It wasn't to be, though — at least not yet. In the video above Mother uberfan Zion-from-Nintendo-Life-here is joined by fellow video fella and EarthBound advocate Jon-from-Nintendo-Life-here to discuss a few facts and theories about the franchise, the years of hearsay, the state of play right now, the forms in which Mother could potentially return in the near future (or, indeed, the distant future), and how they feel about it all.

To prevent overcrowding and crashing servers, Square Enix have had to halt free trials and new sales to keep the game stable after an unprecedented surge in popularity this summer. Between that and the global shortage of materials to add more servers, it may be quite some time until new players are able to experience it. If you have an active subscription and manage to brave the long queues however, you’re one of the lucky few who get to experience something truly special.

If I have to. The indie games I've been playing recently all have a bit of an end-of-the-world flavour to 'em, whether literal or metaphorical or by your own hand, if you feel like it. I dunno, I actually found them strangely relaxing, as a sort of counterpoint to the chaos of my own life during the holiday season. See what you think.

Indie game developer Monsoon Studios has revealed that the crowdfunding campaign for its NES action title Cooper Jacket has been a success.
The game – which offers a simultaneous 2-player mode and takes inspiration from the likes of Contra and Commando – had a very modest funding goal of just $9,000. Thanks to the support of 244 backers, it has managed to raise almost twice that amount, finally securing $16,000 of cash.

Nothing says 'bad family Christmas' like being tortured for 109 years by a sentient supercomputer which nuked humanity and keeps only five people alive to torment. The 90s point 'n' click adventure game is a grim one (so grim!), but one which does have its fans.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's always awesome when you can see your favorite pokémon tagging alongside you in the well-loved RPG. But now, some fans can recreate that feeling in real life with the new Pokémon Collection from Secretlab. The gaming chair company has given its Titan Evo 2022 Series the very best makeover, with the ergonomic seats sporting two of the franchise's most recognized mascots. One of the offerings features an adorable image of Pikachu, with yellow lettering and accents to match. The other orange-and-blue-laced option in this fresh collection is packing a Zard. Both chairs come with a pair of pokéballs stitched into the upper left corner, the creatures' pokédex number in the right, and a handful of themed, custom stitching throughout. 
But before you go off to try and snag one of these functional gaming collectibles, we have good and bad news. The bad? Secretlab's collection is only available in Japan right now while supplies last. So, it would seem like anyone outside that country is out of luck for now. However, there is a glimmer of hope as the manufacturer has provided a link on its website that will allow you to "register interest." We hope this means that – given enough people click the link and provide their email – Secretlab will consider selling these unique products around the globe. So if you'd like to get more news on the chairs and hopefully bring the Kanto-region pokémon to your region, check out the collection's official website.

Narrowing down our favorites wasn't easy, but after much deliberation, here are our top picks for the best heroes and villains of 2021. 
Please note: Neither list is ordered, so just because one character comes before or after another doesn't mean we consider them better or worse in any way. 
HEROES
Ethan Winters – Resident Evil Village
The best horror protagonists are relatable; people who find their circumstances both as terrifying and hard-to-believe as we would in the same situation. This is what makes Ethan Winters such a good lead in the two Resident Evil games he's starred in – Resident Evil 7: Biohazard and this year's excel…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[New year, new Games with Gold lineup, and this upcoming month's titles all seem to have a theme. We are looking forward and backward with a slew of games that run the gamut from ultra-futuristic to retro-futuristic. Come January, Xbox owners with Xbox Live Gold membership or that subscribe to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate will be able to grab the titles listed below for free:
NeuroVoider: Available January 1 to 31
Aground: Available January 16 to February 15
Radiant Silvergun: Available January 1 to 15
Space Invaders Infinity Gene: Available January 16 to 31
As usual, the games are only available for a limited time, so make sure you catch anything you are interested in before it leaves the service. The first up on the list is NeuroVoider, a twin-shooter RPG that sets waves of robotic baddies after you. You'll have to take each of them down to end the neverending war that's been tearing up the cyber futuristic world. Coming in the same window as NeuroVoider during the first half of the month is Radiant Silvergun. The vertical scrolling shoot 'em up was first released in 1998 but has been shined up for modern players.
In the back half of the month, players will be able to pick up Aground and Space Invaders Infinity Gene. The second title, a fresh twist on the well-known Space Invaders franchise, is only available until the end of January, so pick it up as soon as you can. However, Aground, a game focused on building and crafting set amongst the stars, will be available until the middle of February. 
While the end of the year is fast approaching, we still have a little bit more time left in December. So, if you have not picked up last month's Games with Gold, you can pick those up now. This month's free titles included The Escapists 2, Tropico 5: Penultimate Edition, Orcs Must Die, and Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet. There are some good titles in there, so don't miss out if you have Xbox Live Gold or Xbox Game Pass Ultimate.
What do you think about 2022's opening Games with Gold? Let us know in the comments below.]]></summary>

There's some Christmassy-ness flowing in to tide me over, thanks to the mini-Christmas tree in my room. Every year it's popped on the wardrobe alongside an honorary Lynx Africa. They share the same festive colours, after all.
Having pondered my tree for a bit, I thought about trees in games and how they make for good side quests. Now join me by the bark, as I examine why this might be the case in a roundabout manner.

The new Uncharted film is only months away and we just got a brand new trailer to pick apart. Much of the footage isn't new, following the first trailer that was released back in October pretty closely. However, this new look at the upcoming adaptation does give us a few fresh tidbits, including a little more backstory on Moncada, the movie's antagonist played by Antonio Banderas. It seems, his family did more than search for the unbelievable fortune central to the story, they found it but were then betrayed. We'll have to see how this ties into Nathan Drake (played by Tom Holland) and Victor "Sully" Sullivan's (played by Mark Wahlberg) plans to recover the glittering treasure. 
One of the biggest reveals of the trailer came at the end when we get our first glimpse of Sully in the film with his characteristic mustache. In the games, Sully's facial hair is one of his defining features, and one that Uncharted fans immediately noticed was missing in early character reveals. While it felt strange to see the mentor without it, the change made some sense considering this movie takes place before the Naughty Dog series. However, it looks like Sully won't stay clean-shaven throughout the whole film, and you can check out the reveal, along with the rest of the new details in the trailer above. 
Sony Entertainment Picture's Uncharted will release in theatres on February 18. Recent posters found on Fandango showcase some pirate-worthy imagery, of which we see more in today's trailer. This led some to believe that the upcoming movie may have ties to Uncharted 4: A Theif's End, which features a graveyard of similar-looking vessels. However, it's hard to tell exactly what connections we will see between the games and the upcoming adaptation. There's only two more months until we find out.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Every long-running series has its turning points, times that demand reinvigoration and forward-thinking. Tales of Arise was Bandai Namco’s opportunity to enact meaningful change and enter a new console generation soaring. The developers didn’t let the opportunity pass by, rising to the challenge and breaking franchise sales records in the process. Tales of Arise took interesting risks and made smart improvements, resulting in a fantastic RPG full of endearing characters, intense battles, and rewarding exploration.
In its 26-year run, the Tales series has always had a passionate fanbase, but Tales of Arise helped expand the franchise’s reach and elevate its established formula to make it one of the best entries in years. While retaining the series’ essence, Bandai Namco brought in a new visual style, more strategic combat, and a mature story about warring nations. The latter especially made its mark for how it tackled socio-political issues, like racism, authoritarianism, and mental illness. Read more...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been just around two years since Telltale Games announced its return. Populated by some of the former studio's staff and led by a new team, the company announced a follow-up to The Wolf Among Us during The Game Awards 2019. Then things seemed to go quiet, leading many to speculate on how the newly reformed studio was doing. However, Telltale has recently been very vocal about the status of its projects and the studio itself. This most recent post from Telltale's official Twitter account runs down a list of the studio's recent milestones and what it hopes to achieve in the near future. It begins, "Telltale is back." Then the post moves on to assure readers that the company, while trying to stay true to the Telltale legacy, is changing things up and steering clear of the problems that plagued the original studio.
Perhaps the most eye-catching part of the message comes near the end, in the section detailing what comes next. It seems like we will be hearing more about The Wolf Among Us 2 soon. As you can read below, the post states the team will be ready to reveal more news "early next year when we can go deeper into things."
While we are excited to hear news about Telltale's upcoming sequel, the studio has more projects on the horizon. Announced just weeks ago at The Game Awards, The Expanse: A Telltale Series will be an adaptation of the popular Amazon TV show and is being co-developed with Life is Strange: True Colors studio Deck Nine. The two developers have a strong storytelling history, giving us a lot to look forward to in the title.]]></summary>

My days at work were mostly spent alone in a dark projection booth above a corporate auditorium. To spice up my evenings and force some human interaction on myself, I started playing Magic: The Gathering at a local game shop. I spent multiple days a week there, learning how to draft, build decks, and catch onto the lingo and language of the game. Slowly, I incorporated myself into the small group of regulars, and day by day, I felt less alone.
While shuffling decks and slinging spells against these new acquaintances, I noticed shared mannerisms and social archetypes people took on within my little corner of the Magic community. Let me tell you how pleasantly surprised …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I was younger I watched a nature documentary narrated by David Attenborough (I realise that doesn't narrow it down) and in this nature documentary David told me about a cave. It is a very big cave, and every night a huge colony of bats come screaming out of the entrance. They spend the day clinging to the ceiling of this big cave, and all their bat poo falls down and has become a towering heap carpeting the floor.
But then David said look, the carpet is moving. And it turns out that the whole bottom of the cave is covered in cockroaches and giant centipedes. And if ever a small baby bat or an old injured bat falls, it is eaten alive by this hoard of chittering insects. This nature documentary haunted me, for it was the worst thing I could imagine happening.
Anyway, Nate has been to that cave and he's going to tell us all about it for this episode of our supporters only podcast, The Nate Files. Thanks for being a supporter, pals!

Ever a broad church, 2021's seen enough releases to keep ten of me busy, from the easy-going Legion War to the month-consuming Shadow Empire. I don't know about you, but my personal "to play" list is out of control.
And yet, while we've had plenty to enjoy this year, it's felt like a period of build-up to something bigger. I'm not one for looking forward. If a game's not out yet it tends to disappear from my mind, making room for a hundred other recent releases in this age of plenty. That I've less interest in looking back over this year than I do pondering the next suggests that maybe we're in for something special in the coming twelve months. Or perhaps it's just been a rough one and I'm very sleep deprived and don't want to think about 2021. Either way, let's have a look at what's in store for strategy fans in 2022, yeah?

There are plenty of fantastic fighting games out there, both old and new. As Arc System Works continues to update its older Guilty Gear games with rollback netcode, those fighters are given new life. However, is there room for another fighter with recent entries in the genre, such as Guity Gear Strive, and others on the horizon like SNK's King of Fighters XV? After going hands-on with the DNF Duel beta over the past weekend, Game Informer editor John Carson thinks so. 
Game Informer editor and today's host, Wesley LeBlanc, is joined by John, AKA The King of Late Night, AKA possibly the greatest fighting game player in the world, to discuss the recent beta test. The two also talk about what makes DNF Duel different in a busy genre, where its inspirations lie, and most importantly, how it feels to play. 
In this New Gameplay Today, we also have 15 minutes of action-packed DNF Duel Beta gameplay on top of the discussion topics above. Thanks for watching, and be sure to let us know what you think of this upcoming fighting game from Eighting and Arc System Works.]]></summary>

This week's reveal focuses its sights on Electronic Arts' Star Wars Battlefront II video game from 2017. Hasbro is bringing four new action figures from the game to market. All four are Clone Troopers decked out in some of the game's unique armor coloring. Three of the figures fall into the 3 and 3/4-scale Vintage Collection, with the final one joining the Gaming Greats Black Series line.
The latter figure is the Umbra Operative Arc Trooper with a cool black and orange coloring. This clone stands at roughly six inches in height and comes with two pistols. It will be sold exclusively at GameStop with an expected ship date next April.

        <updated>2021-12-22T21:01:29.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Brandon Sanderson, the famed author behind fantasy series Mistborn and The Stormlight Archive series, has revealed he’s working on a video game. 
This news comes by way of a recent blog post he made titled “State of the Sanderson 2021,” which, like previous “State of” posts made by the author, details what he has going on in his career. He mentions feature films, TV series, and more, but he also quickly divulges that he’s been working on a game for a while and we might be seeing it soon. 
“I’ve been working on a video game for several years, and I suspect it will be announced this year,” Sanderson writes. “So commence speculation.” 
Sanderson’s post includes a note that says the game is not based on one of his properties and is instead something new he built with the team he’s working with on this project. He also said that people will recognize the company developing the game but playfully suggests it's “probably not the one you’re thinking of right now,” nor is it “that other one either.” 
And that’s all Sanderson had to say about this game. Sanderson entering the video game scene would be quite a treat for fans of the author, whose only other experience in games is minimal. He wrote a novella e-book in 2011 for Epic Games Infinity Blade series called “Infinity Blade: Awakening.” (Editor's note: he has also worked on some fiction for Magic: The Gathering. – JC) However, as the author notes that this game won’t be based on one of his own series, those holding out for a Mistborn RPG will have to continue their wait. 
Perhaps this development will go so well that Sanderson decides to greenlight a Mistborn game of some kind. While not a full game, you can technically get a taste of Mistborn in the form of a game by way of Fortnite, which recently sold a skin based on Kelsier. Be sure to check out Sanderson’s entire “State of” post for more information about what the author is up to. 
Are you excited to see the game Sanderson has been working on? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In celebration of our Horizon Forbidden West cover story, which digital subscribers read now, we're letting you get a look at the new screens Guerrilla Games shared with us for the story. These shots were provided exclusively to Game Informer for our extensive 12-page feature to highlight certain aspects we discussed.
For some context for the images below, they mostly feature a new area called the Daunt, which is a canyon at the eastern edge of Sundom (Carja territory). This new settlement acts as an onboarding area to get players up to speed with the game’s new mechanics. It is Aloy's last stop before she heads to the Forbidden West. These screens also provide a view of a market and tavern to show off the more lively locales.
Lastly, there's a look at a new machine called the Burrower, which is a successor to Horizon Zero Dawn's Watcher. This common recon machine can tunnel underground and resurface in unexpected locations. When it senses danger, it emits a high-pitched sound to call allies and stun enemies.  According to game director Mathijs de Jonge: "We wanted to add even more character and locomotion to the machines in Horizon Forbidden West, so the Burrowers are very similar to otters or weasels: flexible, quick, and pretty ferocious!"

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The upcoming immersive sim western from former Dishonored and Prey devs, Weird West, has been delayed. 
Previously due out on January 11, 2022, on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC, Weird West will now hit those platforms a little over two months later on March 31, 2022. As for why, the team at Wolfeye Studios needs more time to make it as great as it can be. 
Click here to watch embedded media


“Weird West is an impressively deep mix of action RPG and immersive sim elements built on the Wolfeye team’s experience with Dishonored and Prey,” a press release about the announcement reads. “Early feedback is fantastic but, as is the case with any immersive sim, there are a lot of variables that can lead to unintended consequences. More time is needed to deliver an experience that the community expects from Wolfeye and Devovler. The team understands this might be a disappointment to folks, but want to sure that the game they’ve worked on for years is launched in the best form possible.” 
Weird West was first announced during The Game Awards 2019 and it promised a very weird west indeed, complete with gunslingers and fantastical creatures. Two years later, one Game Informer editor went hands on with it and determined that Weird West is a wild west worth exploring.

We learned a month later – this month – that Ubisoft’s comments in November were less a broach of NFTs and more preparation for a reveal of its NFT-based platform called Ubisoft Quartz. 
Quartz is now live as a beta where players can earn NFT cosmetic items to use in Ghost Recon Breakpoint. However, the announcement and reveal of Quartz was met with criticism, with many calling for Ubisoft to back off the idea of NFTs in its games. A report from Eurogamer reveals that Quartz Digit recipients have sold a total of just 15 of these NFTs, likely a number much smaller than Ub…]]></summary>

Between now and January 5th, thousands of games will be discounted across Steam, and you'll also be able to claim a free sticker every day as well, for those of you who enjoy that sort of thing.

While that’s true, what’s at the heart of the Halo franchise does not change – it’s Master Chief, Cortana, some punchy guns that don’t get old, and a soundtrack that never lets up. Throughout the decades, Chief and Cortana (and buddies like Buck) have found themselves on Earth, Sanghelios, hurtling through space, aboard exploding rings, and more. But no matter the locale, we were finishing the fight – even when some of those battles were more grueling than others.
Sadly, Chief was absent from the fight the Game Informer editors partook in to rank all the Halo games from worst to best. It’s important to note that we opted to rank only the Xbox console FPS Halo games, which means you won’t find mobile, arcade, or RTS spinoffs like Halo Wars or Fireteam Ra…]]></summary>

I envisaged myself wiling away most evenings with my mates, playing Oddball and Slayer and laughing like someone from those video game adverts, swaying violently with a controller in hand.
I now know the reason why and I hate to admit it. Infinite doesn’t have a battle royale mode, which I've come to realise is the perfect FPS template for gaming with my mates. Something about it just works, you know? Listen, let me explain.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know almost nothing about Alfred Hitchcock. He’s the kind of archetypal director whose work I’ve been exposed to in bits and pieces without ever actually sitting down to watch one of his films in full. All of that is to say that, upon starting Alfred Hitchcock - Vertigo the game, I was in no position to judge whether it was a faithful adaptation of the film or to recognize all but the most obvious illusions to Hitchcock’s body of work (look, birds!). That’s okay, though, because as it turns out, Vertigo is an original story based on a collage of Hitchcockian concepts, not a direct adaption of the 1958 film by the same name.
Vertigo the game follows author Ed Miller as he grapples with a debilitating case of vertigo–a condition that leaves him unable to stand as the world appears to spin around him–and paralyzing guilt over the death of his daughter and her mother, Faye, after their car falls off a bridge into a ravine below. With Ed bed ridden, it’s up to Dr. Julia Lomas, psychologist and psychiatrist, and Sheriff Nick Reyes to unravel the mystery of what really happened, and whether Faye and his daughter even exist. My thoughts on how Vertigo goes about telling this story are... complicated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Halo Infinite is joining in on the winter holiday fun other live-service multiplayer games take part in each season, and similar to those, there are plenty of free rewards to earn by taking part. 
Dubbed Winter Contingency, this event began yesterday, December 21, and will run until January 4. What’s more, there are ten free rewards for all players to earn, and earning them is simple: play a match of Arena or Big Team Battle. That’s it. 
Click here to watch embedded media


“Rewards will be unlocked over time, meaning they will not all be available to grab on day one,” a Halo Waypoint blog post about the event reads. “Think of Winter Contingency like your in-game Halo advent calendar: you’ll unlock one reward each day, with the event running through the morning of January 4, 2022. To be clear: While the daily rewards conclude on December 30, what this means is you’ll have several extra days to catch up on any items that you may have missed.”
For example, if you didn’t play a match yesterday, you’re one day behind, but because the event lasts until January 4, you’ll earn your final reward on December 31 (assuming you play a match every day in between now and then). 
Speaking of rewards here’s what you can expect: 
Day 1: Wild Justice nameplate
Day 2: Peppermint Laughter armor coating
Day 3: UA/Tatius shoulder left pad
Day 4: UA/Tatius shoulder right pad
Day 5: Peppermint Laughter MA40 Assault Rifle weapon coating
Day 6: Snowmageddon backdrop
Day 7: Navlogcom nameplat
Day 8: Peppermint Laughter MK50 Sidekick weapon coating
Day 9: Myesel ammo pouch
Day 10: Sunset Contessa armor coating
If you’ve already nabbed your daily reward today and need something to do, check out the official Game Informer Halo Infinite review. Then, give our breakdown of everything available in the Halo Infinite shop this week (including a very Iron Man-esque armor coating and cat ears) a look.

It’s become so popular that Square Enix have temporarily stopped selling the game, taking its Starter and Complete Editions off sale. All the while, some low-poly grapes stayed static in the breeze. Jagged, delicious, minding their own business. Until their blockiness was papped and thrust into the public eye. Memes ensued and the grapes became the talk of the town, so much so that they’ve been smoothed out in the latest patch, much to everyone’s dismay.

It's a gorgeous-looking adventure that came out in early access back in October, but unfortunately the launch didn't go as well as the devs had hoped it would. Yesterday, they announced that they've had to lay off around 25 employees to keep the studio going. They add that development will continue, albeit at an understandably slower pace.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rockstar Games is once again treating PC gamers to something a little extra by giving out a free game with the purchase of Theft Auto: The Trilogy – Definitive Edition.  
As an incentive to buy the collection through Rockstar's store on PC, you'll be able to redeem an additional free Rockstar game to add to your digital collection. That's on top of the advertised 20% discount and the free original versions of the trio of games that were brought back as a make-good for performance issues at launch.
Which games can you snag for free? It's, of course, a selection of titles developed by Rockstar, but there are some great options to choose from. However, you only get one, so choose carefully. Here's the list:
Grand Theft Auto V: Premium Edition
Grand Theft Auto IV: Complete Edition
Max Payne 3
L.A. Noire
Bully: Scholarship Edition
If you already own those games through Rockstar's launcher, you won't be able to redeem a second copy. But, there are a couple of alternatives, like a Great White Shark Cash Card for GTA Online or 55 Gold Bars for Red Dead Online.
You can find the holiday deal on Rockstar's site, which will be available through January 6, 2022. Unfortunately, the deal is only available through Rockstar's storefront, and there aren't any similar deals extended to console players.
Will this incentive be enough to get you to pick up the remastered trilogy on PC? Let us know what you think in the comments.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Assassin’s Creed series debuted in 2007, and since then, the series has become a fixture in the gaming landscape. It received reliable annual installments (or more!) for several years; that cadence has relented a bit now, but the franchise's long history has certainly left us with no shortage of Assassin’s Creed games to enjoy. But how do they stack up against each other?
 We originally published a version of this list back in 2015, but more Assassin's Creed games have released now, and some of our perspectives have shifted. So we are taking another look at the titles in the whole main series (no spin-offs or side-stories) and ranking them, highlighting the best moments and acknowledging the weaknesses in each.

Since the launch of the free-to-play multiplayer component, 343 Industries has done a nice job of offering up colorful items for players to purchase. The latest rotation brings a bundle that alienates dog lovers but should make cat enthusiasts feel right at home.
This week's pricey 2,000 credit bundle is called Fire and Frost and gives your Spartan the red-and-gold coloring of Iron Man. To use this armor coating you need the Yoroi and Mark V armor core. The bundle also comes with the Trash Removal stance, and Tempest of Blades emblem, nameplate, and weapon decal.
The most comical item this week is the Cat Lovers bundle that gives your Spartan helmet cat ears. You also get a faded blush armor coloring and a Tabby charm for your weapons. If you just want to look like a cat yet want to show off your love of food through the charm, the Chow Down bundle gives you a pizza slice charm, a bacon charm, and a Second Breakfast emblem, nameplate, and weapon decal.
For those of you seeking more realism, the Maltese Mayhem Weapon Set offers a variety of weapon models, such as the Critpoint Shroud design for the MK50 Sidekick. You also unlock the Maltese Mayhem weapon coloring.]]></summary>

The report also says that “at least five of the top 25-credited people from the company’s biggest 2021 game, Far Cry 6, [are] already gone,” noting that on the Assassin’s Creed Valhalla side of things, 12 of the top 50-credited developers from that game have departed …]]></summary>

First reported by Nintendo Life, Raw Thrills boss Eugene Jarvis recently took part in a Reddit AMA where he talked about a number of video game-related things, including the recently-released Cruis’n Blast. He said that the next goal for the team is online multiplayer.

“Online multiplayer is out next goal for Cruis’n/Switch…when we get our online multiplayer going, we’ll definitely look at bringing on some more content,” Jarvis said in the AMA. 
While not official confirmation that online multiplayer and additional content are coming to Cruis’n Blast, it’s at least nice to hear that Raw Thrills is looking into both. That’s great because one Game Informer editor who wrote up their first impressions of the arcade racer noted that it was a disappointment Cruis’n Blast didn’t feature online multiplayer. 
Elsewhere in the AMA, Jarvis said he’d love to see the original Cruis’n Nintendo 64 trilogy ported to Switch and that he’ll “talk to Miyamoto” about seeing what Raw Thrills can do. 
Only time will tell if online multiplayer and additional content like new cars and tracks make their way to Cruis’n Blast. For now, check out our thoughts on in it this episode of All Things Nintendo, which is Game Informer’s Nintendo podcast, and then read about how Cruis’n Blast is an unapologetic, enjoyable arcade racing throwback after that.

Best known for the shooter Killzone series, Guerrilla flipped the script and ventured into the open-world action/RPG genre, inviting us to a post-apocalyptic Earth where massive, animal-like machines have become a part of the ecosystem. Horizon Zero Dawn was an overwhelming success, with adrenaline-pumping battles, an awesome protagonist in headstrong Aloy, and exciting discoveries around every bend. We couldn’t wait to experience more, especially since Guerrilla had left some loose ends hanging. Thankfully, the highly anticipated sequel, Horizon Forbidden West, is just around the corner with its February 18 release date.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We’re in Year 2 of the new-gen consoles from PlayStation and Xbox, and it’s still as tricky as ever to get your hands on one. 
This is due to several reasons, including the rise of online bots that automatically purchase these consoles, the resale market, and more, but perhaps chief among these reasons is the ongoing chip shortage. These chips are used in the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S consoles, which means PlayStation and Xbox cannot produce as many as they’d like as quickly as they’d like. Unfortunately, after AMD CEO Lisa Su said back in October that the chip shortage could last into 2022, the CEO of Intel has now said he believes it could last into 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It might be a while until we learn more about the Ghost of Tsushima movie adaptation currently in the works.
That’s because director Chad Stahelski, who’s perhaps best known for directing all three John Wick films (as well as the upcoming fourth one, too), told IGN in a new interview that the team behind it wants to do right by the game. To do that, the team is taking its time.

“We just want to do it right,” Stahelski said. “You know how video game adaptations can go. So we’re taking our time and doing it right. We’re working very closely with game developers to make sure we stick to what’s great about it.” 
IGN notes that Stahelski stated that a script is still being developed for the movie. He also said that fans of Ghost of Tsushima “would be very happy with what we’re working on,” noting that he’s played it “many times,” which is something that initially drew him to the project.
When asked if Jin Sakai English voice actor Daisuke Tsuji would be reprising his role in the film, Stahelski said, “we’ll see,” and they “haven’t gotten that far yet.” Only time will tell for now. 
For now, read about the original announcement of a Ghost of Tsushima movie and then read about how Tsuje really wants in on the film – he even said he entirely agrees to butt-nudity in it. Read our thoughts on the game in Game Informer’s Ghost of Tsushima review after that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The ancient Egypt of Assassin’s Creed Origins is a visually stunning place to explore, and it could soon look even better. 
That’s because Ubisoft has revealed that it’s looking into adding 60 FPS support to the Bayak-led Assassin’s Creed title. This news was announced today, December 21, which also happens to be Assassin’s Creed Day. No, it’s not an anniversary for the first Assassin’s Creed title or any title in the franchise. It’s the day of the Winter Solstice, and in Assassin’s Creed lore, December 21, 2012, was supposed to be the end of the world. 
Happy #ACDay 💝

December 21, 2021
However, Desmond Miles sacrificed himself to save the world from the destruction of Juno. That happened in 2012’s Assassin’s Creed 3. Assassin’s Creed Origins would be released on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC five years later. As the name implies, its story represents the origin of the Assassin Brotherhood (or at least what would one day become the Brotherhood). It sounds like soon we’ll be able to experience that origin story in 60 FPS. 
Unfortunately, those looking for more will have to wait and see what comes of this update, as Ubisoft did not reveal anything else. There’s no word of when this 60 FPS patch might go through, nor is there a definitive guarantee it will happen – just Ubisoft’s assertion that it’s “looking into adding 60 FPS support for Assassin’s Creed Origins.”

After that, read about the now-live crossover between Assassin’s Creed Odyssey and Assassin’s Creed Valhalla, and then check out Game Informer’s ranking of all Assassin’s Creed games.

Games that were delayed by the pandemic last year finally got their due in 2021, but in turn many of the releases we were expecting this year have inevitably slipped into 2022. The pandemic has affected games of all sizes this year, and I don't think it will go down in the history books as one of our all-time greats. There were still plenty of fantastic games that came out this year, mind, and we're still counting down our absolute favourites over in our Advent Calendar. 
That said, I do think 2021 will prove to be a pivotal year for RPS - and not just because I stole Graham's key card and changed the locks on the front door of the Treehouse. It's been a year of immense change here at the site, so I wanted to take some time to reflect on everything that's happened this year, and look forward to what we've got in store for 2022.

This news comes from Nintendo Life, which reports that Konami announced this news alongside many other features players can expect in Master Duel during the Jump Festa 2022 event recently held. The game is not yet out, but it’s expected sometime this Winter, which means its release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, PC, iOS, and Android could be imminent. For now, you can check out its official trailer.

As noted by Nintendo Life, duelists can expect the following features in Master Duel: 
4K resolution duels
Over 10,000 cards to unlock across the series’ history 
A Solo Mode campaign
Deckbuilding and a large database with Decklists
Tutorials to teach players how to play 
Special events and tournaments 
Because of today’s news, duelists can now expect to be able to play their Xbox-owning friend while on a PlayStation, for example. Or, they could play on their mobile device while their opposition plays on PC, thanks to Master Duel’s crossplay support. And thanks to cross-save support, players can freely switch between platforms. You can play primarily at home on a console or PC and then take your progression with you on the go via your mobile device. 
While waiting for Master Duel, read about its reveal and the reveal of Yu-Gi-Oh! Rush Duel Saikyou Battle Royale that happened alongside it. Check out why one Game Informer editor believes Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel might finally be what fans are looking for after that.

“In order to bring you the best experience possible, we’re giving ourselves the necessary time to apply final polish while finishing development on the game,” a Steam post from Square Enix reads. “We’re adding some new items for those that pre-purchase either the game individually or have purchased the bundle. We’re looking forward to sharing the final title in our pixel remaster series with you all early next year and we hope you’re looking forward to it.” 
As far as pre-purchase items go, players will get Locke’s Theme (Timelapse Remix), The Decisive Battle (Timelapse Remix), Terra’s Theme (Timelapse Remix), Searching for Friend (Timelapse Remix), and Aria di Mezzo Carattere (Instrumental). They’ll also get two Final Fantasy VI wallpapers, and two more wallpapers from the pixel remasters of the first six Final Fantasy games.

Originally announced in 2016 for an early 2017 release under Steam's now-defunct Greenlight program, you'd be forgiven for thinking that Blazing Strike was canceled. However, after years of fine-tuning the gameplay, seeking different methods of funding the project, and undergoing a full visual overhaul, Blazing Strike is finally poised to launch in 2022. I went hands-on with a recent build of it and came away impressed with how the game pays loving homage to the 2D fighters I grew up with in the '90s.
In late 2016, developer RareBreed Makes Games delayed the planned playable Steam demo indefinitely. Following an abandoned Kickstarter…]]></summary>

I began The Gunk with eager anticipation, blasting across the swirling clouds of the cosmos. The opening cinematic is beautiful and full of promise. Unfortunately, it is also the apex of the short game’s trajectory. In a game filled with alien worlds splashed with color and populated with extraterrestrial mysteries, The Gunk falls surprisingly flat. Fortunately, this spacecraft manages to stay afloat with likable characters, solid gameplay, and a serviceable story.  
The Gunk’s heroes, Rani and Becks, are a pair of plucky and impoverished space haulers. They touch dow…]]></summary>

I never thought an autobattler RPG would hook me the way it did, but I spent hours upon hours helping a little knight circle a seemingly endless void, and had a wonderful time doing it. If you didn't have a chance to play it earlier this year, it's now free on the Epic Game Store until tomorrow. I heartily encourage you to pick this one up, it's one of our favourite games of 2021.

I'd have given up on the game if it weren't so interesting. For one thing, none of those deaths were final. He died as a child and came back. He died as a teenager and came back. These were not saved games, but ordinary occurrences. It's an interesting world made infuriating by awkward design choices.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week's episode of the Ultimate Audio Bang is both festive, but tinged with sadness. It's Imogen's final run of the pod and I'm very sad about it. But we (I) gather ourselves and chat FPS news, like how PUBG is going free to play, Overwatch actually has something new, and lots of Halo Infinite stuff. We also get one final update on Imogen's Apex Legends rank. I'd love to say it's positive, but it's actually quite crushing. Merry Christmas.

They didn't have much to say about it at the time, but last night they announced it properly. Named Nine Sols, it's an action platformer with combat inspired by Sekiro. Honestly, they still don't have much to say about it beyond that, but they have released a gorgeous poster featuring a cat-like character that you can see in full below.

This is the eighth mainline game in the long-running pizzeria-based horror series (I know, there are loads of spin-offs too), and for the first time it will let players properly roam free, rather than be tied to a desk monitoring cameras.

Halo Infinite's best place is its open world, through which you can swing like a honking metal Tarzan and do sweet Warthog jumps from cliffs. But its best level, the most satisfying A-to-B gun boulevard, comes late in the campaign (spoilers ahead). The House Of Reckoning is a series of rooms where contrived artificial battlefields have been constructed inside an alien fortress. They are abstractly human structures surrounded by sand, as if your extraterrestrial enemies have been playing house but believe a homo sapiens' house looked exactly like a chunk of Normandy beach circa 1944. The narrative reasoning behind this level is absurd. But the fights that occur within are excellent.

Before we get to that, though, we must first discuss (at length) whether 200 t-shirts is a lot of t-shirts, what Nate is having for his Christmas dinner, what kind of cop duo would be named Halloumi & Date, and also what our favourite Christmas songs are.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Final Fantasy VII Remake certainly knows how to make a good first impression. The original's bombing mission sequence, which sees Cloud and co. blow up a planet-killing mako reactor in the industrialised hellhole of Midgar's city centre, was already one of the Final Fantasy series' best openers, but here we get to really luxuriate in every last detail of its twenty-four-year glow-up. Director Tetsuya Nomura may have a reputation for excess in JRPG circles (both in his tangled storylines and his passion for buckles and belts), but in FF7R that tendency toward indulgence has been applied with deadly, laser-like precision.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CD Projekt have announced plans to pay out $1,850,000 (£1.4 million) to settle a class action lawsuit brought by investors over Cyberpunk 2077's troubles. The suit started in December 2020 with investors primarily upset with the fact that the console version was in such a state, claiming that CDP hadn't been honest about the game and its prospects. CDP say that the proposed settlement terms make clear that though they are paying out, this "does not imply admission of any responsibility".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s been nearly a year since Nvidia started reissuing older GPUs, like the GeForce RTX 2060 and GeForce GTX 1050 Ti, to help deal with the great worldwide graphics card shortage. More recently, Nvidia went a step further, quietly launching a brand new version of the RTX 2060 that doubles its VRAM to 12GB.


Emphasis on the “quietly”, mind – even if you’ve been regularly checking for available GPU stock or perusing our graphics cards deals guide, you probably won’t have even noticed there’s a 12GB RTX 2060 knocking around. So what’s the deal with this mysterious card, and should you even consider buying an RTX 20 series card in this day and age?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Gunk might not be the most sophisticated name in the universe for a gooey black jelly that pulses with an ominous red light, but goodness it sure is appropriate. As space haulers Rani and Becks touch down on a forgotten planet in search of a strange energy signal, the place is absolutely gummed up with the stuff. It oozes and throbs in the caves, plains and rivers of this once vibrant landscape, and the urge to suck it all up into Rani's chunky power glove (a literal hand vac in this case) is overwhelmingly strong. After all, when it turns the ground black and saps the world of all its colour, this is one case of Extremely Bad Vibes you'll want to remedy as soon as possible. 
Your reward for scooping up all the gunk in any given area is the kind of graphical wizardry video games do best. A burst of light, a shruum of sound, and the world is instantly transformed back to its former glory. Despite its gloopy namesake, The Gunk is frequently stunning, its soft pastels and coral-esque flora showing such an eye for jaw-dropping visuals that it's hard to believe this is SteamWorld developer Image & Form's first ever 3D video game. If this is what they've been holding back on all these years, then their upcoming action adventure SteamWorld Headhunter should be a real treat for the old eyeballs. That said, while Image & Form have clearly navigated their 2D to 3D transition from an art perspective, their typical flair for adding their own spin to different genres has been less successful. There's a lot to like about this 3D action platformer, but it's missing that spark to really make it sing.

This latest OlliOlli game swaps out the 2D style for a cel-shaded 3D world that looks absolutely lovely. Or radical. Or sick. Or other skater words. The action-platformer's plot sounds great too, it drops you into Radlandia on a search for the skate gods. Skate gods! Don't anger them, kiddos, they'll break your collarbones.

Babble Royale is a new Scrabble-like battle royale where 16 players fight to be the last letters standing. You have to make words in such a way that you escape a zone that's closing in, and attack other players by building words off of theirs. I honestly didn't think it would work, but man, it absolutely does.

I crave an altogether more sedate beginning to next year, and so my mind turns to games in which violence, reflex or any other kind of unblinking attentiveness takes a back seat. 
Looking for a broader mixture of games? Check out our regularly updated list of the best PC games you can play right now.
Primarily we're talking violence-free games here, but I wanted to drill a little deeper than that - so nothing that generally requires a competitive streak. I'm chasing a certain feel rather than a certain category. Flying, walking, puzzling, driving, building, dreaming, climbing, stretching, swinging (not like that), swimming, wondering: these are just a few of the ways in which flashing pixels can make you feel a very different sort of accomplishment.

They’re expensive, often cumbersome, drastically over-designed things that lean way too heavily into the g4m3r aesthetic, and that’s coming from someone who’s built up something of a tolerance to it from years of unprotected RGB exposure. I’ve sat on them and have even shared homes with some of them, but have never, ever seen the appeal over a halfway decent office chair.

That’s one thing I learned from my time with this kung-fu caper. To keep my fists flowing, I needed to be patient, and not mash the buttons. Seriously, slap those buttons with zero thought and you’re dead.
Death in Sifu means you age, and if you die lots, you age faster. Hit 70 and you won’t be rising from the dirt again. Instead, you'll have to start your quest for vengeance over from the beginning. While it can be tempting to cling onto your youth for this reason alone, I actually liked growing old, with my beard and my harder-hitting attacks. Not only do you develop a relationship with your body in Sifu, but your trips to the afterlife also help you master its myriad of moves. Sifu really does get better with age.

Okay, so actually we don’t have much time left now. You must play these beat 'em ups before they disappear into the realms of non-free (sort of; you know what I mean). Here’s why.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of my absolute favourite platformers, Rayman Origins, is free to keep on Ubisoft Connect right now. Ubisoft are giving the 2D side-scroller away as part of their 35th anniversary celebrations, which is wonderful news. It's one of the best co-op games I've played, so it's a perfectly timed freebie if you're in need of something to keep friends and family entertained over the holiday period.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Inscryption is, without a doubt, the best game I've played this year. It's creepy, surprising, and superbly fun, and now you can play the best part for as long as you please. Developer Daniel Mullins has released a "mini-expansion" in beta on Steam, which (minor spoilers ahead!) makes its animal-based card game a standalone roguelike experience. Named Kaycee's Mod, it's slightly tougher than what you might have played already, and adds new challenges too, so you can keep going back in for more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I finished watching The Game Awards reveal trailer for Rumbleverse, the new Epic-published battle royale game that looks a bit like Fortnite but with melee combat, I raised a practiced eyebrow of derision. "Well, that looks terrible," chortled I, knowing full well that I'd still give it a go at the earliest opportunity because I am an absolute sucker for battle royales.
Two things happened later that day that I did not expect. First: I got the opportunity to dive into Rumbleverse's action-packed 40-player matches far earlier than I'd anticipated, as part of a one day early look at the game. I downloaded and installed it in short order, and jumped right in. Two hours later, at 1am in the morning as the servers shut down, I happened across a second, far more unexpected thing. I found myself absolutely desperate to play more. I've sunk thousands of hours into Apex Legends, Fortnite, Plunkbat, Hunt: Showdown, Warzone, and various other behemoths of the genre. Yet those two hours I spent playing Rumbleverse might be the most fun I've ever had in a battle royale.

And then you think: why wouldn't someone make another game where you climb and bring low gigantic beasts? After almost three years in early access, Praey has reached v1.0, adding two new boss battles in the process.

The video is pre-alpha footage and it emphasises that this is still a work in progress, but the character creator (called Paramaker, a name chosen by the game's community) looks ridiculously detailed even so.
Paralives is a life sim game that may even have the chops to topple The Sims' supremacy when it launches. This video of the character creation is the beefiest look at Paralives we've had for a while. Marvel as the Paras change musculature, fat distribution and weight before your eyes. Importantly, you can give your Paras some sick tattoos and amazing patterned jackets, because what's the point making a tiny puppet to play with if they're not well cool?
