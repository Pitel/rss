        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been a big year for Cyberpunk 2077 and The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt developer CD Projekt Red. It released Phantom Liberty, the first and only expansion for Cyberpunk 2077, debuted its soundtrack on streaming services, revealed plans for a live-action Cyberpunk project, and just this week, nabbed four nominations for The Game Awards 2023. Now, CDPR has announced it is working on a mod editor for The Witcher 3 that will hit PC sometime next year for free. 


"We're thrilled to announce that we're working on a mod editor for The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt," a tweet from the official Witcher Twitter account reads. "It will allow you to create your own experiences in the game by making something completely new or editing existing quests and content. We're planning on releasing it for free in 2024. Stay tuned – we'll have more to share next year."

Notably, CDPR says this mod editor for The Witcher 3 will allow players to create their own experiences in the game, meaning people can develop their own fantasy adventures starring everyone's favorite monster hunter. In a reply on Twitter, the official account confirms this mod editor will only be coming to PC.
If you haven't yet played The Witcher 3, you should and you can read about why in Game Informer's review of The Witcher 3.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's-an-RPG!
On paper, Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars is a game that probably shouldn’t exist. It brought together Nintendo’s platforming icon with RPG giant Square in a way that seemed impossible, imbuing the denizens of the Mushroom Kingdom (and beyond) with bucketloads of personality beyond the hops, jumps, and yelps they were previously known for. It’s got humour in spades, from tongue-in-cheek jokes to characters pantomiming events whenever they retell them. It’s weird and hilarious, and it knows it — and that’s why people love it.
So it’s a darn good thing that Super Mario RPG, the Switch remake of 1996's turn-based favourite, retains the weirdness that gave the SNES original a special charm. Not a hair is out of place in this remake. We said in our preview that this is one of the most faithful HD adaptations we’ve ever played, and now that we’ve seen everything the game has to offer, we stand by that statement, and it’s all the better for it. This is a magical experience reworked to near perfection with high-definition clarity.

Oh, you’re still here. That’s understandable. After all, I don’t think you needed me to tell you that Super Mario RPG is a fun game. This unique collaboration between Nintendo and Squaresoft garnered a devoted following almost immediately upon release, and that passion from its fans endures to this day. While this is technically the origin point that led to the Paper Mario and the Mario & Luigi series, Super Mario RPG remains one of the wackiest and most surreal games the mustached plumber has ever starred in. Quite frankly, it's a miracle we’re even seeing this game again at all.

The original Super Mario RPG, released for Super Nintendo in 1996, felt like it was meant to be your first RPG. In an era when Final Fantasy tried its best to tell mature stories within the medium's limitations and Dragon Quest demanded hours and hours of your time, Mario’s adventure felt much brighter and more manageable. Familiar characters, a lighthearted story, a reasonable length, and timed button-pressing during combat made it stand out against the competition. Revisiting the game more than 25 years later in this new remade shape shows the original formula did n…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this year, it was revealed that a stop-motion animated Pokemon series is in the works. We've gotten our first trailer and it's outrageously cute. 


The Pokemon Company has partnered with Netflix to produce Pokemon Concierge. The series follows a girl named Haru (voiced by Karen Fukuhara) who begins work at a tropical Pokemon Resort. She quickly discovers just how peaceful the resort can be but it's not all relaxing, as she also has to ensure the Pokemon have a good time.  




The stop-motion is being done by Dwarf Animation which also handles My Dad the Bounty Hunter.  All the Pokemon look criminally cuddly with their felt skin and adorable cries. The trailer features a catchy theme song by Mariya Takeuchi, and it gives the impression that we'll be in for a tranquil but action-packed adventure. 


Haru will meet Tyler, Alisa, and Watanabe during her time at the Pokemon Resort. The original animated series has been running since 1997, so you aren't alone if you've had more than enough of it. This unique spin-off could be a great way to get old fans interested in the Pokemon world again.


The series has four episodes that are 14-20 minutes each. It hits Netflix on December 28.

It says it is doing so to align with "the new competitive market." 505 Games is the publisher behind games like Ghostrunner 2, Control, Payday 2, the PC version of Death Stranding, and more; it's unclear how much of that team will be affected by Digital Bros' overall plan. 
"Digital Bros has reviewed its projects to align with the new competitive environment," it writes in a press release.

The game first started in 2012 with its sights set on a modest mobile horror experience. Anyone who has ever worked on anything creative knows how easy it is to get carried away, though. What began as a mashup of concepts inspired by Resident Evil and adventure games like Five Days a Stranger — with the lo-fi restraint of something like The Legend of PicoHERO — fell prey to overambitious scoping. 


Catechesis soon expanded beyond the limits of mobile and continued to grow from there. Eventually, after regularly revealing new characters, maps, and other additional content, the…]]></summary>

We are so close to the release of Nintendo's next big release of the year that we can almost smell it (gross). Yes, Super Mario RPG is set to leap back onto Switch on 17th November — that's this Friday — and, after being particularly enamoured with the remake when we went hands-on with it earlier this month, we are eager to see what the review scores are looking like for the return of this SNES classic.
Well, we can now start to get an idea of what the critics think thanks to Ryokutya2089 (via Gematsu) as the review score from Japanese publication Famitsu has been revealed. Long story short, it's looking really rather good.

It’s powered by what the developers are calling “living ink”, an art style that fills in each papery map as you play. 


The game certainly looks arresting: your cursor is a quill, the HUD is a collection of smaller parchment scraps, and the terrain is a slowly brightening wash of swirling colours, leaking beyond the outlines of trees and buildings. Lovely stuff. And what's more, you get to beat up a bunch of wolves.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[And they call it a mine!
One of the many adorable-looking titles that appeared in yesterday's Indie World Showcase was Core Keeper, a mining sandbox game that will be unearthed on Switch in 2024.
There is a good level of Stardew Valley-style vibes in this pixel art farmer/builder, though this one is set in a mine — groundbreaking... literally. Developed by Pugstorm, Core Keeper will see you drawn into an ancient underground area thanks to a mysterious relic. In the hopes of one day escaping, what you do down there is up to you: you can explore the caverns, take down enemies and upgrade your skills, or collect resources to build a life for your community under the earth.

Konami has released a new update for Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 1, bringing the compilation up to version 1.3.0.
The patch notes cover all platforms, so while there's not a great deal here for Switch players, there are a couple of notable improvements, including frame rate fixes for Metal Gear Solid 2, and cutscene fixes for Metal Gear Solid 3.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Naughty Dog has been pretty quiet on the gaming front this year, though the HBO series continues to be popular. According to Production List, filming for season 2 is scheduled to begin on January 7 next year. 


Like the prior one, season 2 will be filmed in Canada. Production List has Craig Mazin and Naughty Dog's Neil Druckmann returning as producers and writers. Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey also return, presumably reprising their roles as Joel and Ellie respectively.

What to expect from season 2 of The Last of Us


The upcoming season will be split into two parts. This makes sense for anyone familiar with The Last of Us Part 2. In a prior interview with Deadline, Mazin also discusses how the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes affected work. When it struck, they were in the middle of scriptwriting, but that had to be put on hold. 


They had gotten pretty far already, and Mazin was able to "write and submit the first episode right before the deadline hit." According to Mazin, the next season of The Last of Us is scheduled to air in 2025, though nothing is certain yet. Despite the setback, he still really wants "to try and get this show on the air when it’s supposed to be on the air." 


Mazin also gives hope that the series won't end with the second season. There are already ideas being tossed around, and he is adamant that the "show will not end with Season 2 unless people don’t watch it and we’ll get canceled." 




Many franchise fans have also been waiting for the multiplayer counterpart of The Last of Us Part 2 to launch. For a while, it seemed like the project had been scrapped but Naughty Dog game director Vinit Agarwal has confirmed he's still working on it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are plenty of mysteries to solve and secrets to uncover in Alan Wake 2. Don't forget to get to the bottom of Mayor Setter's campaign, as it comes with a surprising revelation. Alan Wake 2 spoilers are below. 


As you explore Bright Falls, you'll likely notice all of Mayor Setter's ad campaign. The ads are eye-catching, especially because despite the passionate campaign, it doesn't seem like Mayor Setter has much competition. The game does give you hints along the way regarding who the mayor is, though it's easy to not piece the story together if you're not paying enough attention.

Meeting Mayor Setter


There are six Mayor Setter ads scattered throughout Bright Falls and Watery. You'll find them on the parts of the map marked below.

By Return 6: Scratch, you will have access to all the ads, but don't go any further, or else you'll be locked out of full exploration. Find them all then head into Saga Anderson's Mind Place where you'll find a poster depicting the cutest dog. Go to Suomi Hall, and you'll discover the dog on stage, waiting to be petted. That's Mayor Setter! 


It's worth petting the dog, as you'll earn the Nice Things in Life achievement, and you'll score a charm that allows you to see all collectibles on the map. This is very useful to have if you're aiming to 100% complete the game. 




Mayor Setter has become quite popular among Alan Wake fans on Twitter and Reddit, indicating that the pup politician has a good shot at winning debates without barking a word. Petting Mayor Setter is also a nice break from the more morbid petting Saga does when she encounters taxidermy deer heads.

The game was meant to be released at the end of the month across all platforms, but due to some "recent confusion," it seems the remaster has gone live early in these regions. As a result, these versions will include a number of known bugs and are missing some quality-of-life improvements.

All three core worlds—Losomn, N'Erud, and Yaesha—were so distinct and immersive that they very well could have been their own games. In the first Remnant 2 DLC, players revisit Losomn in an attempt to track down the One True King.


The new Forlorn Coast adds another variant to Losomn, making it one of the zone's three roll possibilities. The mad king thinks everyone has betrayed him, and teleports his castle smack dab in a Dran coastal town. After my roughly seven-hour journey through the new area, I was pleased with the content the DLC added to Remnant 2. To put it simply, this is just more Remnant 2, and that's not a bad thing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A huge part of Cities: Skylines appeal lay in its modding community, which expanded on the citybuilder's robust foundations with new maps, assets and more for years post-release. Cities: Skylines 2 is still waiting on its own official mod support, but Paradox have offered a new update on progress, saying that the editor is "a couple of months" from being in a releasable state, with no concrete timeline as yet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[10 islands enter, one island wins. The Game Awards' Geoff Keighley has orchestrated an in-game opportunity in which players can now vote on the battle royale title's best user-created island of the year.


The announcement came from Keighley this afternoon. In collaboration with Nighttimes and Studio 568, the partnership has created a hub world that Fortnite players can travel to to vote in-game on what they believe is the best original locale out there.




The in-game experience is something The Game Awards creator, Geoff Keighley, has been excited about for years:


"Ever since I hosted Live From Risky Reels in Fortnite in 2019, I’ve been thinking about ways The Game Awards could bring our celebration inside the games we play every day," said Keighley in a press release. "Our Fortnite island is the first experiment in this direction, and I’m particularly excited to help shine the spotlight on the amazing user-generated community around the world."


The Game Awards Island, located in-game at 0853-1358-8532, features 10 creator-made islands that can be voted on once a day per Epic ID. After players finish voting, they can explore the custom island to find Game Awards statues scattered throughout. If all of the statues are found, players will enjoy a nice XP boost for their efforts. 


The Game Awards Vote in Fortnite event begins today and runs until December 6 at 6:00 p.m. PT. The winning island will be revealed the following night, December 7, during The Game Awards live and within The Game Awards Fortnite island. For more The Game Awards coverage, check out all of this year's nominees here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's always room for one more good one.
In 2019, a small French studio called Hibernian Workshop released a game called Dark Devotion, a promising 2D soulslike that was met with mixed reviews, but managed to garner a passionate fanbase. A couple of years later, the team returned with a Kickstarter pitch for a new roguelite called Astral Ascent, which hit its funding goal within two days and managed to blow past it considerably in the weeks to come. Since then, the crew has been busily working away at it while sharing periodic updates, and the day has now come that Astral Ascent is seeing its full release. We’re happy to report that this is a tremendous new entry in the Switch’s packed roguelite library, quickly inserting itself amongst the very best.
Astral Ascent is set in a modern fantasy land called the Garden, which is a lush and beautiful prison guarded by 12 godlike jailers, each based on a Zodiac symbol. You play as one of the prisoners in this magical place, trying your absolute hardest to break out and secure freedom for both you and your allies. Each of the Zodiacs has a unique personality and clearly knows their prisoners personally, and as you engage in your endless attempts to escape, more of the backstory is slowly revealed that highlights the connections between these characters and why they find themselves locked in this seemingly eternal loop.

If you're unfamiliar with the title, the comedic actor describes it perfectly in the video as "a real-time physics simulation game with fully destructible environments." Essentially, it's a sandbox game where you can blow literally everything up. As Wilson so eloquently puts it, "Breaking stuff is fun, and the bigger the stuff, the bigger the fun."

What might be coming after it? On that front, Valve suggests that the Steam Deck 2 is pretty far out.


In a recent interview with Axios, Valve's hardware designer, Yazan Aldehayyat, said that "[Valve thinks] that a Steam Deck 2.0 is necessary. Steam Deck OLED was necessary. We feel like there's a road map ahead of us." Indeed, the OLED version of the device might effectively target the very same performance envelope as the baseline, but it does deliver some key wins with a bigger battery, a hugely improved display, and other quality-of-life boons. It too is just the next step in what appears to be a longer journey for the company…]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-11-14T19:07:37.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Netmarble is working on an open-world action game based on The Seven Deadly Sins manga and anime, and it looks pretty ambitious if the latest trailer is any indication.


The new preview made its way online just ahead of the 2023 G-Star event, which will be held in Busan, South Korea, from November 16 to 19. As pointed out by Gematsu, Netmarble got in on the showcase with a video highlighting some of the Unreal Engine 5-powered combat and exploration. See how the world of Britannia looks in The Seven Deadly Sins: Origin trailer below.




Apocalypse Soon


Based on the manga by Nakaba Suzuki, The Seven Deadly Sins: Origin features a bunch of characters from both that and sequel series Four Knights of the Apocalypse. Tristan Liones, the son of original leads Melodias and Elizabeth, serves as the main protagonist. The visuals accompanying the game's open-world trappings look straight out of the anime adaptation, which includes multiple seasons and films. 


This isn't the first journey into Britannia for the developers. Netmarble previously worked on mobile and PC outing The Seven Deadly Sins: Grand Cross, billed as a "cinematic anime game." I didn't personally play enough of that one to say for sure if it has a mine cart section or not. Origin, on the other hand, definitely has a mine cart section according to the new trailer. In a perfect world, it'll at least be better than 2018's dismal Knights of Britannia. 


The Seven Deadly Sins: Origin currently has its sights on consoles, PC, and mobile. There's no release date in place at the time of this writing, but hopefully we'll find out when to expect it soon.

Právě probíhají snahy o reverzní inženýrství nad koprocesorem RP1 od Raspberry Foundation, protože dokumentace ještě nebyla uvolněna. Zároveň HackADay vydal novou analogovou badge a vyhlásil soutěž, a také vznikl nový zajímavý demoboard s 2x RP2040. Zároveň byly uvedeny nové tiskárny z dílen Prusa Research. Strahováci také byli na OpenAltu, kde měli několik přednášek a můžou vám z nich ukázat pár zajímavostí. Věděli jste, že jde vyrábět plnobarevné plošné spoje? Ano, už se nemusíte omezovat na jednu barvu, brzy bude dostupná plnobarevná výroba. Také bude k vidění náhrada za drahý systém Tag-Connect nebo ryze český cín SN100C. Chcete vědět, jak jednoduše se dá napadnout iPhone Flipperem nebo jak se hackuje šifrovaná flashka? Pak se vám určitě budou líbit softwarově orientovaná témata. Samozřejmě si bastlíři ani tentokrát neodpustí poněkud bizarnější témata, třeba na co nepoužívat rentgen, co dokáže Arduino ve velmi nesprávných rukou nebo kde všude se dá najít NodeRED.


Příští Virtuální Bastlírna se pod taktovkou projektu MacGyver studentského klubu SiliconHill bude konat ve středu 15. listopadu od 20:00 minimálně do 22:00 (ale obvykle končí o dost později). Odkaz na konferenci se před samotnou akcí objeví na bastlířské wiki.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[No (minish) cap.
Publisher Raw Fury popped up in today's Indie World Showcase to give an update on the gorgeous creature-collecting deckbuilder, Moonstone Island, which we now know will be flying onto Switch in Spring 2024.
Aside from the pull of the retro Zelda-style visuals, this game seems to have a little bit of something for everyone. This life sim will see you exploring over 100 procedurally-generated islands, collecting creatures and crawling around the dungeons therein with card-based battles. Then, you'll return home to plant crops, decorate your house, mix potions and maybe even find love — pretty packed, eh?

During today's Indie World showcase, A Highland Song has been announced for Nintendo Switch, and it's not far off either, launching next month on December 5th, 2023.
Featuring adaptive storytelling that caters to your own choices, A Highland Song sees you traverse across the Scottish Highlands against the beautiful music of some of Scotland's leading folk bands. It looks really nice - kind of a lighthearted take on Oxenfree - and we're absolutely loving the trailer music from Talisk.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blade Chimera, a new title from Team Ladybug and WSS Playground — the teams behind Touhou: Luna Nights and Needy Streamer Overload, respectively — and published by Playism, was announced to be coming to the Switch at today’s Indie World Showcase. It’s a 2D, side-scrolling action game set in an abandoned neon cyberpunk city, and I am totally here for it.


In the announcement trailer, we’re shown a bit of the combat against monsters like a horde of giant frogs, mechanical dragons, and what seems to be a demonic sumo wrestler. But, what I think is the coolest part is that the main character’s sword has the ability to create structures to help them get around tricky obstacles. In the trailer, for example, we can see the sword manifest a bridge to help them cross from one area to another, and later we see the sword create an escalator to help them progress.




It also looks like the sword can be used for more practical uses during battle. In the trailer, we see the sword trapping one of the giant frogs in its radius and inflicting constant damage for a couple of seconds, and later we see it creating cover that blocks a particularly threatening bird enemy’s beam attack.


Blade Chimera is set for release in the Spring of 2024, and it’ll be available on the Nintendo Switch. If more information, including other platforms or a more specific date are made known, we’ll be sure to update this page accordingly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While we still wait for confirmation on Nvidia's alleged RTX 4080 SUPER, Team Green's most powerful graphics card continues to have overheating problems. In fact, one repairman has experienced such an influx of broken GPUs they've had to take their health into consideration.


As spotted by Tom's Hardware, repair shop Northridge Fix has said it's been receiving between 20 and 25 Nvidia RTX 4090s a week. All of which need fixing due to melted power connectors.




In a recent YouTube analysis video, a repairman for the company has said that he's had to purchase a face mask so he doesn't have to keep "smelling the burn on those connectors," referring to the ones on the broken graphics cards.


The smell is "unbearable"


Health risks aside, this influx of GPUs being sent to Northridge Fix is part of an ongoing problem with Nvidia's piece of enthusiast hardware. The RTX 4090s have been known to have overheating issues since day one, but concerns have been largely dismissed as being down to "user error."


The footage also shows the amount of 4090 cards that have been sent to the repair shop. More than 10 have been fixed recently, with the repairman concluding that the "melted connector is not a user problem."


The fact that the RTX 4090 has a TDP of 450W could be part of what's causing them to overheat. Compare that to the RTX 4080 with a TDP of 320W (according to TechPowerup), and it's easy to point a finger at the culprit.


The Ada Lovelace range has been out for over a year now. At the time of writing, Nvidia doesn't appear to have made significant steps towards addressing the issues with the 4090. It's possible more cases will come to light.

Despite the noticeable lack of Hollow Knight updates, though, there were quite a few games that caught my eye. This didn't feel like a big showstopper, but it's definitely tacked a few more games onto my watch-list. And heck, with a few available today, it's added onto my increasingly large 2023 backlog.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The name sounds terrible, but Second Impact Games’ Super Crazy Rhythm Castle is out today to remind us that Konami still sometimes publishes video games.


Super Crazy Rhythm Castle is, predictably, a rhythm game, but the whole musical gameplay is set alongside an adventure mode. Rather than just be a series of similar challenges, the musical tracks are set alongside a variety of different situations and utilized for different means.


Not only that, but you can team up with other humans for four-player co-op so you can suffer from your friends and family’s complete lack of rhythm. I often play Rock Band with my family, and it’s best if I just focus on what I’m doing while they hack away at easy mode. Speaking of which, you can fine-tune your difficulty.




You may have been excited by Konami’s inclusion as the publisher. The Konami name still evokes thoughts of Goemon and Castlevania in my head. But while no classic characters are shown off in the trailers, someone does pick up a Famicom-looking Holy Cartridge that announces it contains Vampire Killer from Castlevania. Aw, heck yes.


It’s actually an entertaining-looking little title. I had planned on checking out the demo during the recent Steam Next Fest but didn’t get around to it. But maybe I will. And if you’re interested but not sold quite yet, you still can.


Super Crazy Rhythm Castle is available now on PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Switch, and PC.

WayForward took to today's Indie World Showcase to reveal that a lost chapter of the Shantae series, Shantae Advance: Risky Revolution, will be hair-whipping its way onto Switch in 2024.
This one was originally in development for the Game Boy Advance back in 2001 before being shelved, but now WayForward has brought back the original team to fill in the gaps in Shantae's story. We heard of this revival back in July, but today is the first confirmation of a Switch version — which, of course, we love to see.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today's Nintendo Indie World event presented plenty of gorgeous titles for the Switch. One standout is Inkle's A Highland Song which attempts to capture the feeling of exploring the wild and wide Scottish mountains. 


According to creative director Joseph Humphrey and lead level designer Nat Clayton, their own experiences adventuring through nature influenced the game. As they explain, the Scotlands wilderness is exceptionally beautiful, but it is also a dangerous place that can take you by surprise if you aren't prepared. 


Inkle has tried to capture this in A Highland Song which features both tranquil and treacherous landscapes. You'll have to tackle difficult climbs and fast-paced rhythm runs to survive the often unforgiving outdoors. It features an art style too adorable to not fall in love with, and the trailer reveals that you'll be treated to several breathtaking scenes of the natural environment.

How you explore your environment will dictate how the story plays out. We don't know much about the story yet, except that the heroine is on a quest to go to the sea by Beltane. As you unravel the tale, you'll be serenaded with relaxing Scottish folk music to ensure your journey is unforgettable.  


The game launches on December 5 this year, and pre-orders begin today. If you're looking for something relaxing yet captivating, A Highland Song seems like it might be worth a peek.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Humble Games and Memorable Games have announced their investigative life sim, On Your Tail, for a 2024 release window.


I like life sims and being made to feel smart for completing simple tasks. On Your Tail has you step into the hooves of Diana, an "intrepid young detective," as she tries to unravel a mystery set within a seaside town. I guess the mystery isn't too pressing, though, since you can also spend time on the beach, make friends, and go fishing. Crime can wait; it's time to relax.




The detective game genre is getting a little crowded these days, but I can't help but get excited by the dioramas. You collect clues by investigating, which take the form of cards that you play in a diorama sub-game. It looks cute. Who doesn't love a good diorama?


As an added bonus, in the Indie World Direct, Andrea, the game's executive producer, wears an incredible shirt. It is, as Destructoid's own Eric "Lightspeed" Van Allen refers to it, "Indie World Dip."


On Your Tail is set to release in 2024. The Direct only mentions a Switch release, but there's a Steam store page up for it, so it's at least coming to PC, as well.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last July, I reported that the once-lost GBA game Shantae Advance would launch on the Game Boy Advance in 2024. While this was a neat revival, many at the time wondered if we might also see this title on platforms that aren't more than a decade old. Thankfully, we have an answer now.


Announced during today's Indie World Showcase, Shantae Advance: Risky Revolution will also launch on Nintendo Switch next year. Based on the footage shown, it appears to be a mostly faithful port of the upcoming GBA title. This even extends to the multiplayer Battle Mode, which players can play locally in this version. That said, the character portraits do flex the better-than-GBA resolution, more closely resembling what we saw in Shantae and the Pirate's Curse.




After the presentation, developer WayForward went on to clarify that Shantae Advance will also appear on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and PC. Additionally, we got confirmation that those character portraits will still be in the Gameboy Advance version of the game, just not in HD like the trailer shows.


We still don't know exactly when Shantae Advance will arrive in 2024. But we'll certainly keep our eyes peeled as we learn more about these unearthed games.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As refreshing as a river in a dry land.
Never let it be said that Atlus is one to let its star franchises go untapped. It’s now been seven years since the Phantom Thieves were first introduced in Persona 5, and since then we’ve gotten an enhanced re-release of that game, a dungeon crawler, a rhythm game, a musou, an anime, a manga, and several crossovers with other franchises, such as Joker making an appearance as a fighter in Super Smash Bros. While we continue to wait for the inevitable unveiling of Persona 6, Atlus has decided to keep the spinoff train rolling right along with Persona 5 Tactica, a tactical RPG featuring the beloved cast in yet another new adventure. We’re happy to report that Persona 5 Tactica doesn’t feel like a half-hearted attempt to cash in on the Phantom Thieves once again — this is an engaging strategy game with plenty of cool ideas and fun moments.
Persona 5 Tactica picks up during the events of Persona 5, when the Phantom Thieves are hanging out in Café Leblanc and find themselves suddenly pulled into an alternate universe that might or might not be the Metaverse. Our daring heroes’ powers don’t work quite the same here, and they soon find themselves accosted by a crazed, powerful bride named Marie who commands a legion of Shadows. Marie rules over her domain with an iron fist, and she easily crushes the Phantom Thieves, kidnapping and brainwashing all but Joker and Morgana. These latter two are just about to be subdued themselves when they’re saved by Erina, a mysterious girl who leads a small resistance effort that Marie is hellbent on stamping out. The two thus team up with her and set out to reclaim their friends, hoping to defeat Marie and escape from this strange world.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Persona 5 kids are trapped in high school, their semesters stretched into infinity by the inescapable march of spin-offs that have been retroactively stuffed into every available blank spot. Since the credits rolled on Persona 5 (and also before, and sometimes concurrently), the Phantom Thieves have spent their time in a rubbish Dynasty Warriors knock-off, got lost in a dream about a really cheap rhythm-action game and ended up trapped in a cross-generational dungeon crawler. Now they find themselves embroiled in - of all things - an X-COM style turn-based strategy game. 


Your energy for Persona 5 Tactica is going to come down to how much tolerance you have for the Persona 5 brand’s Baz Luhrmann-style maximalism. If you're emotionally invested in the gang, it'll definitely help. But even if you're a Persona veteran or a total newcomer, you'll find the story a bit loose, the chats a bit tiring, and the combat a bit simplistic. Then again, if you're a Persona fan, it's still more than a good excuse to sink back into another adventure with your pals.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Persona series has its fair share of spinoffs. In fact, there are now more Persona offshoots now than mainline Persona games, and that’s where Persona 5 Tactica finds itself: a new take on some familiar territory, showing the Phantom Thieves in a more strategic light.


For Tactica, this means adapting the mechanics of Persona not to fighting games, dancing, dungeon-crawling or musou, but to tactics. And it does work well, even when its best sides take a little while to appear.

Persona 5 has become its own sort of mini-franchise within the Persona series. With many spin-off titles released over the years, such as Persona 5 Strikers, Persona 5: Dancing in Starlight, and Persona Q2: New Cinema Labyrinth, Atlus seems to love using Persona 5’s popularity to explore new stories and gameplay ideas. However, I applaud Atlus for making all of these spin-offs in completely different genres from each other. The latest, Persona 5 Tactica, delivers an entertaining story, a colorful cast of charact…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Making a strategy game is "harder than people give it credit for," Bit Reactor's CEO Greg Foertsch tells me. The same could probably be said of any game this year in particular, but having spent over 20 years shepherding the art teams at Firaxis on Civilization, XCOM, Sid Meier's Pirates, Alpha Centauri and most recently Marvel's Midnight Suns, Foertsch has seen firsthand what it takes for strategy games to break new ground over the years, and what an arduous road it's been for the genre to get where it is today. Not only was it "late to party on 3D, they were late to the party on consoles," but it's also "suffered from lower budgets, which means it just hasn't pushed in the way that other genres have," he says. 
Even now, "it's got some catching up to do," he continues, but there are plenty of reasons to be positive, too. As we speak at the beginning of September, our conversation quickly turns to Baldur's Gate 3, whose enormous success Foertsch cites as a clear and obvious sign that "there's a thirst for something different now," both within RPG circles and, perhaps a little unexpectedly, for strategy heads as well. It's his hope that his own upcoming project, the closely guarded Star Wars strategy game his new studio Bit Reactor are working on in collaboration with Respawn, will follow in these lauded footsteps. "We want to make a game and just have people say, 'Man, that's amazing game, and oh, it happens to be strategy.' That's the goal."

Much like The Boys, it's got a not-very-nice version of Superman, Omni-Man, who you might have seen doing not-very-nice things in Mortal Kombat lately.
Skybound and Kirkman's first videogame based on the license isn't about Omni-Man, though. Developed by Terrible Posture Games, it's about Atom Eve, a high-school do-gooder who can manipulate the atomic structure of the world, changing one thing into another.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you’ve been enjoying Jusant, Don’t Nod’s post-apocalyptic climbing sim, you might also like the alpha playtest for Chasing The Unseen, which has just been updated with a new level. It doesn’t have Jusant’s quietly innovative grip and abseiling mechanics – the climbing is closer to Shadow Of The Colossus, consisting of just one button you hold to cling on till your stamina runs out. Nor does it have the Don’t Nod game's beautifully nested chunks of backstory - no seashells you can press your ear to, alas. But it does have massive flying cephalopods, giant red mushrooms, and floating, fractured landscapes of rock and grass. 

The gameworld drifts whimsically between categories, neither macroscopic nor microscopic, at times a kind of ocean reef, and at other times, a mysterious, alternate dimension we might summarise as “Cthulhu’s Zen Chillout Room”. The climbing aside, you can glide short distances by inflating what looks like a blowfish, and there are (regular-sized) capybara to chase down and collect. When you die, the game plays a didgeridoo at you in a faintly jocular way. The whole thing pongs of quantum physics.

As revealed by the company's Gamescope GitHub page, however, there appear to be two companies supplying the display.


As per line 906 of the referenced GitHub, Valve is sourcing the much-touted Steam Deck OLED display from two separate suppliers: SDC and BOE, which stand for Samsung and BOE Technology, respectively. This isn't necessarily cause for concern on its own, as these are the same companies that supply OLED displays for Apple's own iPhone 15, but it is certainly worth taking into account, considering one of the original Steam Deck's early stumbling blocks: the whiny fan noise.

This time around, you can expect new games like Persona 5 Tactica and the console version of Dune: Spice Wars, as well as DLC and updates, and more. And, per usual, some games are leaving Xbox Game Pass this month. Let's break it all down below. 
Available starting today is Coral Island for Xbox Series X/S and Xbox Cloud gaming. Coral Island "invites players to be who they want and experience enchanting island living at their own pace – living off the land, nurturing animals, building relationships with a diverse cast of townsfolk, making the world around them a more vital and harmonious place."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Given the hype surrounding it prior to release, pretty much everyone expected Starfield to be a rousing success. However, most probably expected (hoped, even) it would have a healthy amount of staying power. But as recent stats show, Bethesda's newest IP is experiencing a drop in popularity.


According to the data on SteamDB (as spotted by Rock Paper Shotgun), Starfield has fewer people playing the game right now than Skyrim. At the time of writing, the former is just shy of 14,000 concurrent players, while the latter has nearly 16,000 for the Special Edition alone.


Add onto that the 1,796 fans playing just regular Skyrim and we get a picture of just how much more engaging Bethesda's 2011 epic RPG is.


It's a tall order to beat Skyrim


Of course, given TES5's legacy – and having just celebrated 12 years – it's a tough act to follow, even from the game's own developer. Starfield launched to significant feedback, most of which was pretty glowing, but interest is definitely waning now.


Maybe this is a question of overhype. Often, video games struggle to match the expectations that people have, and some of the time, it's the fault of the developer for pushing a product too hard (hello, No Man's Sky).


That's not to say Starfield is a bad game. It's been nominated for Best RPG at this year's The Game Awards, so it's not exactly without merit or kudos. There's just something about the fact that one of the most anticipated releases of this generation is seemingly losing its audience. And it's only been out a couple of months.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This year's surprise Soulslike hit, Remnant 2, may end up being a substantially bigger game than anyone initially expected, according to Ben Cureton of Gunfire Games. Cureton is the Principal Designer working on Remnant 2, and he revealed that "there is a very good chance" more DLC will be coming.


This information comes from the latest of Gunfire Games' several AMA threads on Reddit, where Cureton goes into substantial depth about Remnant 2 and its ongoing development by responding to the players' questions. While it has been known for some time now that Remnant 2 would get three major DLCs post-release, Reddit user Korten12 asked whether more DLC might be coming once they are out. Cureton, using his "verytragic" Reddit account, responded with the quote featured above.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While the original Alone in the Dark arguably set the scene for modern survival horror, Resident Evil is the one most think of when it comes to the genre. Capcom's legendary series has endured and while official remakes have been hitting the ground running, fan projects have also been attempting to leave their mark.


Team Arklay has recently uploaded a trailer for its unofficial remake of the first Resident Evil entry. Simply called Biohazard RE1, the upcoming game is being made in Unreal Engine 5, and from what we can see in the footage, it looks pretty impressive.




While it's fair to say it's not exactly sporting photorealistic visuals, the post-cutscene moments definitely breathe new life into the OG RE. It should also be noted that this trailer is representative of work that's currently in progress. As such, we can expect things to look even better further down the line.


A mix of old and new


What's interesting about this fan remake is it seems to aim for the graphics of a more modern Resident Evil installment without compromising on some of that old horror movie cheese. The series has notably become a bit more serious and gritty over the years, so it's nice to see Team Arklay keeping some of that goofiness.


Biohazard RE1 is still in development, with no projected release window yet. However, we know the game will give you the option to choose between the over-the-shoulder camera or go old school with a fixed camera perspective. Again, it seems to be going for a mix between classic and modern RE.


The future of Resident Evil is looking pretty good at the moment. Brand-new entries and official remakes have kept Capcom's franchise fresh and exciting. There was a period in which the RE name was starting to lose focus. However, with the way things are going, a ninth mainline game is something fans will be looking forward to.

I haven’t been as mixed on a Call of Duty game in a long time since Black Ops 4; another game with a problematic release given its lack of a campaign. On the one hand, this game features some of the best foundational gameplay since my favorite era of Call of Duty. But then, on the other hand, it lacks substance and relies too heavily on nostalgia best left in 2009.

Mustakro on Twitter has taken their enjoyment of the game's boss designs and turned some of Lies of P's toughest challenges into Cuphead-style bosses, and it rules. 


I came across Mustakro this morning, scrolling through my Twitter feed, when I saw a really awesome rendition of Lies of P's King of Puppets boss (one of the most difficult in the game) in the style of Rubberhose, which is that classic animation style popularized in the 1920s seen in Cuphead.

The MtG x Tomb Raider Secret Lair set launches on November 20, and it will feature the following cards: 



Lara Croft, Tomb Raider


The Lost Valley 


Heart of the Explorer


Storm of Yamatai 


The Grim Whisper


Totec's Spear


Kitezh, Sunken City


Treasure



As seen, there's plenty there to amuse franchise fans, including the Storm of Yamatai card which features the setting for Tomb Raider (2013), and Kitezh which makes an appearance in Rise of the Tomb Raider.


Lara's card is also interesting card with comes with the following ability: "Whenever Lara Croft attacks, exile up to one target legendary artifact card or legendary land card from the graveyard and put a discovery counter on it. You may play a card from exile with a discovery counter on it this turn." 


The collaborations have been a hit with fans, and Wizards of the Coast senior product designer Daniel Nguyen seems to know why. In an interview with IGN, he states "the goal is always to create products that respect and celebrate the partner, the fans, AND that the cards in the drop feel like they belong in someone's deck." Achieving all these goals requires a delicate balance, but WotC has been doing a commendable job at it. 


You can expect more exciting crossovers in the future. It has been announced that thanks to a Marvel partnership, cards featuring Marvel's superhero pantheon are coming in 2025. Fallout and Final Fantasy are also coming to MtG next year.

Though Alan Wake 2 still tracks the story of the fictional famous writer who finds himself up against supernatural forces, the inclusion of Saga Anderson allows players to switch between two realities and experience the narrative from different perspectives. It was a bold move, especially considering how long fans have waited to finally spend some time with Alan, but judging by critical reception, the risk paid off.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Xbox has a long history of making novelty consoles, and the latest one you'll get to enjoy is the chocolate bar Xbox Series X inspired by the upcoming Wonka movie. 


The Wonka Xbox is designed to look like a delectable chocolate bar straight out of the fictional chocolatier's factory. It comes bundled with a display that looks like the front of Willy Wonka's whimsical store. 


Despite how delectable it looks, you can't sink your teeth into the console, though Xbox has come up with ways to satisfy your sweet tooth. There's also an Xbox controller that is 100% edible. It comes in a gold wrapper and is accompanied by 5 chocolate truffles themed around gaming.

Xbox goes bonkers for Wonka


Taking inspiration from Roald Dahl's iconic children's tale, you'll have to enter a competition for the chance to score a Wonka Xbox. To do so, simply follow Xbox on Twitter and retweet the competition announcement with the hashtag #XboxWonkaSweepstakes. It appears that this will be your only shot at a chocolate Xbox, as the prizes are "limited to sweepstakes only – not available for retail." 




The chocolate console isn't where the Xbox and Wonka collaboration ends. As the announcement reveals, the Microsoft Experience Centres in Sydney, London, and New York will feature a Willy Wonka-inspired display and puzzle box in the shape of a briefcase. Solve the puzzle, and you'll stand a chance to win some custom Xbox goodies. 


The upcoming film hit screens on December 15, and it explores Willy Wonka's rise to stardom as a quirky chocolatier. Timothée Chalamet takes the lead, with Paul King serving as director.

They go on to say that while those regions will have access to the Switch version of the game early, it will be a version with "known bugs and missing quality-of-life improvements." Nightdive also says that a patch for these issues already exists, but they can't deploy it at the early launch in these regions. Furthermore, because of the mix-up and the certification process, they expect that the patch won't be available for these regions until mid-December, whereas other regions and platforms will have it at…]]></summary>

Mashing up my favorite Spirited Away and Stardew Valley and featuring my favorite pastimes of taking baths and drinking tea, it had everything going for it. Heck, the protagonist is a writer who travels to the countryside to work on their latest book. I'm a writer. At least, I sometimes claim to be.


But after nearly 20 hours, I was a season and a half into the game. I’d befriended a handful of spirits and villagers. The bathhouse was coming along. But it was crawling. Forget relaxing; going back to Spirittea was beginning to just add to my misery. Something went wrong here.

I’ve been fighting a losing battle to try and get Extreme Paintbrawl working on a modern PC. That game has the reputation of being the absolute worst game ever built in Ken Silverman’s wonderful Build Engine. While the engine was home to games like Duke Nukem 3D, Shadow Warrior, and Blood, it also had a lot more questionable games. Last week, I covered 1998's Nam. This week, we’re looking at another game by the same developer, World War II G.I.. Maybe next week, we’ll look at William Shatner’s TekWar if I can get it working. Let’s hope not!

Call of Duty cycles through its lineup of villains on a yearly basis. Sometimes it's Nazis, other times it's Russian nationalists or zombies. But the most dangerous threat is one without a lust for brains or access to weapons of war; it's stagnation. And while many Call of Duty teams often switch up just enough variables to stave off monotony, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III fully submits to the annual churn.

Today though, it's down to $19 on Amazon, a sweet 32% discount that makes it near impulse buy territory for anyone that has a PC for which a regular mouse and keyboard setup isn't quite convenient.

Fingers crossed, the anniversary return of the series’ earlier video games might lead to some of its overlooked adaptations getting their chance in the spotlight. In other words: when will Trespasser finally get the respect it deserves?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After months of character reveals, Tekken 8 has announced the final fighter of its launch roster: Reina. This brand-new character sports a lightning-quick moveset, earning her the nickname “Purple Lightning," and has mysterious ties to the Mishima clan.
Bandai Namco states that little is known about Reina's history besides she’s a student of the Mishima Polytechnical School. For some reason, she really wants to fight Jin (move over, Hwoarang), and based on her gameplay trailer, she seems more than capable of taking him on. Check Reina out in action below. 


With Reina’s addition, the 32-fighter roster is now complete. Here’s the full list of characters, with new fighters denoted and links to applicable articles/trailers:
Alisa Bosconovitch
Asuka Kazama
Azucena Milagros Ortiz Castillo (New)
Bryan Fury
Claudio Serafino
Devil Jin
Feng Wei
Hwoarang
Jack-8 (New)
Jin Kazma
Jun Kazama
Kazuya Mishima/Devil Kazuya
King
Kuma
Lars Alexandersson
Lee Chaolan
Leo Kliesen
Leroy Smith
Lili Rochefort
Ling Xiaoyu
Marshall Law
Nina Williams
Panda
Paul Phoenix
Raven
Reina (New)
Sergei Dragunov
Shaheen
Steve Fox
Victor Chevalier (New)
Yoshimitsu
Zafina
Additionally, the game's first Season of post-launch DLC will add four unannounced fighters. These characters will be released separately each season throughout 2024, with the first arriving sometime in the spring. 
Tekken 8 launches on January 26 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. Check our early hands-on impressions of the game here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Amazon is laying off 180 jobs in its games division, hopping on the tragically overcrowded bandwagon of layoffs in the game industry this year. The news comes via Aftermath, which reports that the layoffs are focused in two areas – the Crown Twitch channel, which will reportedly be eliminated altogether, and the game growth teams. Employees were notified of the changes through an email from Christoph Hartman, VP of Amazon Games. This is the second wave of layoffs this division of the company has faced this year.
An excerpt of the announcement email can be read below:
There have been so many layoffs in the gaming industry this year that it's getting hard to keep track of. Last week, we learned Free Radical Design is on the verge of closing down and that Ubisoft laid off more than 100 employees. The week before that, roughly 100 employees were laid off at Destiny 2 developer Bungie. 
In January, Microsoft laid off 10,000 employees amidst its ongoing $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard, which it completed last month. 
In August, Striking Distance Studios, the team behind last year's The Callisto Protocol, laid off more than 30 employees, and that same month, Mass Effect and Dragon Age developer BioWare laid off 50 employees, including long-time studio veterans. The following month, in September, Immortals of Aveum developer Ascendant Studios laid off roughly 45% of its staff. 
Just last month, The Last of Us developer Naughty Dog laid off at least 25 employees, and Telltale Games underwent layoffs as well, although an actual number of laid-off employees has not yet been revealed. And in late October, Dreams developer Media Molecule laid off 20 employees.
The hearts of Game Informer's staff are with the people laid off from Amazon Games, along with everyone else who has lost a job this year.

While the throwback 3D platforming adventure looked great in its own right, what caught a lot of people's attention was the team behind it.

Whitehead isn't alone, though, as various other Evening Star developers also worked on Sonic Mania. While we've still got some time before the game's release – it's due out sometime in 2024 – Game Informer has a special sneak peek at its music and can exclusively reveal three tracks from the game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alan Wake and Control developers Remedy Entertainment have announced that their untitled co-op shooter, the artist formerly known as project Vanguard, will no longer be a free-to-play game - largely, it seems, because the free-to-play business is looking a bit dicey. The game has been given a new codename to celebrate: Kestrel. It's still a co-op multiplayer affair, however.


The reboot follows an evaluation period during which Remedy and publisher Tencent discussed a proof-of-concept version of the game, as we reported last month. They've now kicked it back to the concept phase "due to uncertainties in creating a successful game [in] the rapidly changing free-to-play market and associated risks". A few members of the old Vanguard development team have moved to other Remedy projects, while the core leadership and certain select developers carry on with Kestrel.

November 13, 2023
As with every Indie World Showcase, the question must be asked: is this the time where we finally see Hollow Knight: Silksong, the Hollow Knight sequel from developer Team Cherry that began life as a DLC to the original game? It probably won't be but it's always fun to get your hopes up a little bit so that they may be gently crushed. 
Tomorrow's Indie World Showcase for Nintendo Switch begins at Noon ET. 
In the meantime, read Game Informer's Hollow Knight review and then check out everything announced during the last Indie World Showcase, which was held in April, for a glance at what to potentially expect with tomorrow's.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Studio Ghibli's Spirited Away is a film about a spoilt young girl who is obliged to work at a bathhouse for supernatural creatures, after her parents are turned into pigs by a wicked witch. Spirittea from Edmonton, Canada-based Cheesemaker Games is Spirited Away in the guise of a Stardew Valley-style management sim. Released today, it casts you as a wholesome young entrepreneur who has just arrived in a town full of rogue supernatural creatures. To free the town from its spectral infestation, you must renovate an old mountain bathhouse and treat each phantom to a jolly good scrub. You might also need to deal with some Unfinished Business, such as tracking down a lost possession. At least there's no witch to worry about. That I know of, anyway.


I have fond memories of Spirited Away - it was the film that re-introduced me to anime as an undergraduate, following the traditional early-career middlebrow otaku phase of obsessing over Akira, Cowboy Bebop and Ghost in the Shell while turning my nose up at stuff like Naruto, because it's "just for kids". I was on the brink of pitching a Spirittea review, but then our reviews editor Ed Thorn emerged howling and gibbering from the floorboards and asked me to review a 100-hour RPG instead (won't spoil), so I'll have to settle for trying the demo.

I would like to propose an analogous theory for horror games and cute games whereby past a certain point of cuteness, the videogame in question teeters over dramatically into dread and nausea. We could call it the "horseshuwu effect".


As evidence of this, please witness the unholy magnificence of Saccharinity of Starfield, a Starfield mod from lucyprrrr and the Sakura Candy Society, which treats Starfield's items, spaceships, buildings, vegetation, planet models and, worst of all, people to a barbie-doll makeover reminiscent of a seriously overclocked shoujo anime.

As such, I'm tickled gall-bladder-pink to hear that Blizzard consider the action-RPG series "a wonderful platform" for different types of game, now that they've made the leap to an open world format. 


For the most part, said experimentation will occur in the course of Diablo 4 expansions - the first of which, Diablo 2 throwback Vessel of Hatred, will launch in late 2024, adding a new class to the game described as "never before seen in the Diablo universe". But from the sounds of things, there's scope for the "franchise in general" to evolve too.

It has been almost a year since the release of Warhammer 40,000: Darktide, meaning it's been now a full year of apologies, paused expansions, and transformative patches. And yet it lives.

The co-op shooter now seems on firmer ground, and to celebrate it's getting a two-part update called The Traitor Curse. Part one will add a new zone and mission, among other updates.

Naturally it became an internet sensation all the way back in 2007, bolstered further by the release of the source code in 2011 and a tidal wave of fangames that followed.

Now there's an easier way to make those fangames. I Wanna Maker is a freeware precision platformer with level editor and easy level sharing, and it just hit version 1.0.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Roadwarden's creator, the Polish writer and designer Aureus of Moral Anxiety Studio, is an enthusiastic and inventive player of table-top games. Many of his ideas for 2022's finest historical fantasy RPG have their twitching, eldritch roots in pen-and-paper sessions with friends. Take questions of money and wealth. Speaking to me over Zoom one rainy October afternoon, Aureus recalls one particular table-top campaign he ran in which, after 10 or so sessions, the player party had sunk into abject poverty. "They reached a collapsed village, [and] they said, 'is there a cart around here?' So I rolled the dice and decided that all right, there is a wagon, that's completely functional with all its wheels and so on. So they just started to walk around and shove on the top of their wagon, whatever of value they could find. 


"They had no shame!" Aureus goes on. "Just gathering all the scraps of iron, all the tools, knives, musical instruments, pieces of fabric - anything they could find, they were just taking it all with them on the assumption that whenever they reached a civilised spot, they're just going to sell it all."  This was foolhardy behaviour, because all the objects in question were trash with little resale value. "So they at the same time they had more than they could ever need, and they had pretty much nothing. They mainly had a hindrance that was slowing them down - this wagon full of stuff was just difficult to move through the paths."

Spider-Man sees the friendly neighborhood hero battle a star-studded gallery of villains in an original adventure chock full of comic book goodness. As Spider-Man's first fully 3D action-adventure game, it laid the groundwork for mechanics such as web-swinging, a variety of web shooter attacks, and wall-crawling stealth gameplay. Let's see how it holds up 23 years later.

It comes courtesy of Aerothorn, who asks: What is your favorite co-op gaming memory? (along with the additional clarification that these memories don't need to be confined to designed-for-co-op games, but could also stem from playing a single-player game with a friend. "I used to play Descent with me piloting and my friend gunning!" they said).
So which games make us think of happy times with pals and good company? Come and find out below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Speaking to investors in an earnings call this week, GTA 6 publisher Take-Two's CEO Strauss Zelnick had a bit to say about the eternally uncontroversial topic of videogame prices. In news worth holding the press for, he thinks they're pretty cheap for what you get in return.
Zelnick cautioned one investor against "generalising" about the state of game pricing based on the recent fortunes of TV and movie subscription services like Netflix, which have had to increase subscription fees to match their expenses after underpricing themselves initially to grow their audiences. Videogames might be all about subscription services these days, Zelnick said, but that doesn't mean they are subject to the same commercial logics as ye olde non-interactive media. In particular, it doesn't mean publishers are currently able to raise videogame prices, even if they feel like they're overdelivering.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Put your sleuthing caps on, detectives—it’s time to solve some mysteries! We are proud to announce that a whole batch of HeR Interactive’s Nancy Drew games are now ready for public testing:
In Nancy Drew: Stay Tuned for Danger, a soap opera star needs your help in uncovering who is behind a series of death threats that sound a little too real for comfort. 
Nancy Drew: Message in a Haunted Mansion has you helping out with repairs in a Victorian mansion. However, a series of strange accidents, plus some murmurings of a ghost haunting, quickly threaten to turn this renovation into an investigation.
In Nancy Drew: Treasure in the Royal Tower a failed ski vacation at an eccentric castle with even more eccentric inhabitants soon turns into a quest to uncover a lost piece of the history of the French Revolution.
And if you’re looking for something more thrilling, in Nancy Drew: The Final Scene, you will find yourself racing against the clock to find your kidnapped friend, while also saving a historical theater with more than a fair share of secrets from demolition.
The games are available for purchase through HeR Interactive’s website or Steam (Stay Tuned for Danger is not available on Steam, however). Or if you already own a CD copy of the games, their English and Russian variants will also work. To play them with ScummVM, you will need a daily development build. As always, if you encounter any issues, please submit a bug report to our issue tracker.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The fake video games in movies and TV shows can be difficult to understand, for an obvious reason: they're not real games. Their function is providing a few seconds of motion, colours, and noises, and possibly a premise for a plot to riff on. They don't need to be coherent or good. Still, sometimes these glimpses and ideas are interesting enough that I quite enjoy trying to figure them out. Take Gods Of Combat, a fake first-person shooter featured in police procedural show Criminal Minds. Apparently it's such a great game that the only way to achieve a similar high after being banned is hijacking a schoolbus and forcing teenagers to kill each other.
Here's a fun (nonlethal) game we can play together, reader dear: I'm going to describe Gods Of Combat as best I can, then you tell me how you think it works.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As a staunch Nintendo head in the early console days, I would say my affection for PS1-era games is... present, but not particularly palpable. For me, the PlayStation One was mostly a machine to play Final Fantasies VII through IX on, and not much else (it was a very belated and cheap second-hand purchase, I should note, and games were still sufficiently expensive back then that maintaining two healthy game libraries for both the family N64 and my new Squall box was nigh on impossible). Nevertheless, I've been increasingly fascinated by the revival of PS1-era games in recent years, and it's been interesting to see which modern games have been "demade" in this style - see Bloodborne PSX - and which ones have made it their own from the off - see Signalis, Heartworm, and many others. 
Crow Country is the latest game I've seen to take up the PSX mantle, and it combines the chunkiness of Final Fantasy VII-style character models with the grimy survival horror of something like Resident Evil to brilliant effect. Made by SFB Games, the same devs wot made the also excellent Tangle Tower, it's currently got a very good demo up on Steam at the moment, and it's got me thinking: what do you like most about PS1-era games on PC, and which ones are your all-time favs?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you've seen Netflix's Arcane League of Legends animated series, there's a high probability you really like it – the show's great, even for non-League of Legends fans. It tells the heartwrenching story of sisters Vi and Jinx and their struggle to come to terms with each other in the high-tech (and magical) utopian city of Piltover and its seedy underbelly known as Zaun. The first season hit the subscription streaming service in November of 2021and now we know that Arcane Season 2 hits Netflix this time next year. 
More specifically, Arcane Season 2 drops on Netflix in November of 2024. To coincide with the news, Netflix has released a short teaser featuring Jinx. Check it out below:

With roughly a year to go before Season 2, if you haven't yet watched Arcane, which features voice actors like Hailee Steinfeld, Yuri Lowenthal, Ella Purnell, and more, you've got plenty of time to do so – and it's well worth your time!
In the meantime, check out the League of Legends Jinx champion skin that was added to Fortnite to celebrate Arcane, and then read Game Informer's review of Ruined King: A League of Legends story. Read about Convergence: A League of Legends Story after that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[World of Warcraft's expansion pack The War Within, out next year, comes in several flavours. There's the standard version of the pack, which includes access to previous expansions, currency for cosmetics and a level 70 character boost. The Heroic edition gives you all that plus a mount, a pet and extra in-game cash. And then there's the most expensive Epic edition, which includes a pet, two toys, 30 days of game time... and three days of early beta access to the game, yours for $89.99 in the states. 


Naturally, World of Warcrafters are rather concerned about the last bit. It's the first time Blizzard's long-running MMO has taken the paid early access approach, recently adopted by Starfield and Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 - there have been early access betas in the past, but they've been doled out by lottery. Blizzard's game director Ion Hazzikostas has now moved to reassure the grousers and gripers, promising that The War Within's Epic edition won't give minted early worms the edge over those poor peasants who scoop up the less pricey versions.

The 2TB model is currently discounted over at Amazon US, where you can find it for just $103 rather than its usual $128 - one of the best prices we've recorded for a 2TB drive of this speed and quality.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Valve has unveiled its first upgraded iteration of the Steam Deck. Dubbed simply the Steam Deck OLED, the new handheld features several technical and form factor improvements, and it goes on sale next week.
As the name implies, the device boasts an HDR OLED screen to produce more vibrant colors. It also boasts a larger battery for an increased charge – 30-50% more battery life depending on the game, with Valve pointing out that the OLED screen consumes less power.
The device also includes an updated and more efficient AMD APU and Wi-Fi 6E, resulting in downloads up to three times faster for increased bandwidth and lower latency. Steam Deck OLED also runs cooler thanks to its bigger fan and improved thermals. Overall, the device is 5% lighter than the original model.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To quickly recap my Steam Deck OLED review, Valve’s refreshed handheld is brilliant, serving up major improvements to screen quality and battery life while making loads of little quality-of-life tweaks. Its reveal was a surprise, mind – haven’t Valve repeatedly said that there wouldn’t be another new Steam Deck for ages?


Not quite. That warning was always qualified in that a more powerful Deck was still a ways off, and the Steam Deck OLED’s performance improvements are both tiny and a likely incidental result of its efficiency savings. This very point was repeated to me in an interview with Valve designer Jay Shaw and software engineer Jeremy Selan, which also covered the Steam Deck family’s future, its current struggles with intensive big-budget games, and why they want "more, more, more" rivals like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go.

I was told as much on the Steam Deck’s first anniversary earlier this year, and according to Valve designer Jay Shaw and software engineer Jeremy Selan, that stance won't change once the Steam Deck OLED releases on November 16th. In an RPS interview, the full version of which is coming soon, the two developers explained why the real next generation of Steam Deck will take a few years – and why they decided against making the Steam Deck OLED’s new processor more powerful as well.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I didn’t know the Steam Deck OLED existed until last week, and yet it’s essentially something I’ve wanted for nearly two years. As great a handheld gaming PC as the original Steam Deck is, its slightly bland IPS display and short battery life are some definite weak points – points to which newer, shinier rivals, such as the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go, have been happy to apply pressure.
Valve are keen to stress that this OLED-equipped model represents an update, not a whole generational switcheroo. Yet there’s much, much more behind that screen that just some different diodes. This is a lighter, brighter, longer-lasting, sometimes even faster-running take on the SteamOS handheld, and one that sneaks in some surprise upgrades as often as it addresses issues with the original Steam Deck. I love it.

It’s a "definitive" refresh of the existing Steam Deck handheld PC that swaps the underwhelming IPS display for a brighter, more vibrant OLED panel, while making numerous battery life improvements – up to and including a new, more efficient AMD APU – that promise significantly more time away from the mains. It’s not far off either: the Steam Deck OLED’s release date is November 16th, just one week away.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For Vladimir Makarov, the babyfaced villain of Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, trust and morale are irrelevant concepts. As he makes clear to his army of Russian ultranationalists, he is interested only in their quiet, unwavering loyalty. Evidently, Activision expects much the same from its army of COD fans. This latest Modern Warfare campaign follows disconcertedly close on the heels of 2022’s entry because, as per Bloomberg, it began life as a mere expansion. Rather than allow a fallow year, Activision has upgraded that expansion’s status to a premium release, and charged $69.99 for pre-orders - granting early access to the single-player campaign as an enticement.


Instead of Modern Warfare’s usual lead studio, Infinity Ward, development duties have fallen to Sledgehammer, the outfit most recently responsible for 2021’s unloved Vanguard. And in an industry where AAA FPS games now regularly take half a decade to make, this campaign has reportedly come together in less than two years. Reader: it shows.

Pre-ordering players and a few lucky journos (whom we absolutely don't fear and resent for receiving copies early) have been able to play the campaign since 1st November, and the reactions and reviews thus far haven't been great.

Braid was first released for Xbox 360's Live Arcade on August 6, 2008, and stars Tim, a boy searching for a princess captured by a monster. The 2D platformer centers on time manipulation mechanics that players utilize to solve puzzles and locate/assemble jigsaw pieces.

A faked death finally saw him freed from the shackles of the yakuza with one big catch: he couldn't ever see his family again. Since then, we've had the plucky Ichiban take on the mantle of Tojo Clan nastiness in Yakuza: Like A Dragon (7), with its sequel Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth (8) set to wash up on Hawaii's shores next year. What do we know about Infinite Wealth? Kiryu is set to return as a protagonist alongside Ichiban, with an all-new haircut. And more importantly, what has Like A Dragon Gaiden got to do with any of this? Well, it's a shorter stop-gap between the events of Yakuza 6 and Yakuza 8 that fills us in on what Kiryu's been up to this whole time.
But aside from moreish minigames and a fantastic Agent persona with web-slinging abilities, Kiryu's epilogue is a far cry from Yakuza's best stories. By no means is it bad, it just isn't the best introduction to the series for newcomers, and even longtime fans will struggle balancing his resurrection with its heavy feelings of repetition.

I want someone who really, really loves and hates things, and gives you reasons why.”
It’s a trait which Giovannetti has in common with his Megacrit co-founder, Casey Yano, and has possessed ever since he was a kid growing up in Woodinville, 30 minutes outside Seattle. It’s matched by a competitiveness that first emerged in Warhammer 40,000 tournaments as a teen. Before he was old enough to drive, Giovannetti would ride his bike to the local game store and play until the early hours of the morning.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[GTA 6 publisher Take-Two Interactive’s CEO Strauss Zelnick has been on the blower to the company’s investors about the idea of making games using the latest artificial intelligence content generation tools. Echoing his relatively guarded enthusiasm for NFTs a couple of years ago, he’s sort of mixed on them, regarding AI tools less as transformative technologies than simply the latest step towards the eternal industry objective of More, Faster And Better For Less.
Zelnick thinks automated learning and generation tools will make development more “efficient” and games, overall “better”, but in terms of Take-Two’s own bottom line, any gains will likely be offset by the fact that other big companies have access to the same tools, and by the fact that Take-Two will take advantage of said efficiencies by setting more ambitious goals. As such, he doesn’t think using generative AI will lead to lower prices for big commercial games. If you’re a developer that can’t afford to buy or license generative “AI” tools, Zelnick added, you can expect competition to become “more intense” in the coming years. Good stuff.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this summer, amid an incoming typhoon, Game Informer visited the Bandai Hobby Center Shinkan, the 132,000-square-foot factory where the entertainment company manufactures its iconic Gundam model kits. If you purchase a new Gundam model kit at your local store today, it originated in this facility in Shizuoka, Japan. The factory contains 35 plastic color-molding machines – 25 electric and 10 hydraulic – all helping produce millions of models yearly.
Bandai Spirits employee Miyuki Nakagiri, the subject matter expert on how exactly the factory operates, escorts us through the building. Our translator during this tour is Atsuo Yoshimura, a video game production manager who’s worked at Bandai Namco for the last 17 years. Notably, Yoshimura worked on last year’s Elden Ring – Game Informer’s 2022 Game of the Year, and most recently, Armored Core VI Fires of Rubicon. Additionally, Yoshimura was instrumental in helping to coordinate Game Informer’s recent Armored Core VI cover story trip.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Intel's Core i5 12600KF is one of the company's best value gaming CPUs, and today it's down to $155 at Walmart (fulfilled via Newegg) versus its standard price of $220. 
This chip offers solid gaming performance in modern AAA games plus PCIe 5.0 and DDR5 support (with the correct motherboard) all while costing significantly less than competing CPUs like the later 13600KF ($285) or AMD's Ryzen 5 7600 ($229) which offer only marginally better performance at 1080p and are basically the same speed at 1440p or 4K. 
For reference, I saw the 12600K deliver a minimum of 85% of the performance of the later 13600K (and by extension the nearly identical 14600K), while costing 54% of the price with this deal - surely that makes the 12600K the obvious choice?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As regular readers of this column will know, I'm a big fan of OLED TVs and monitors. One of my favourites is Dell's Alienware AW3423DWF, a 34-inch ultrawide that offers a fairly standard 3440x1440 165Hz spec - but its QD-OLED panel makes for a night-and-day difference against your standard VA and IPS panel alternatives, with perfect contrast, near-instant pixel response times, gorgeous colour reproduction and stunning HDR. 
It normally retails for around £929, but today it's down to £739 when you use the code GROUPON8 at Dell UK. That's about as cheap as we've ever seen it, and well worth it for anyone that wants a monitor primarily for gaming rather than content creation or mixed purposes.

Having built yourself a no-name crim, you galloped around cranking out cash and XP by means of glorified sidequests handed down by headliners such as Lamar. Skip forward to 2023, and as Alice0 observed when we discussed Rockstar's GTA 6 announcements this morning, GTA Online is effectively an MMO with ten years of updates, expansions and community projects under its belt. The no-name crim has become the star attraction.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hallowe’en may be over (just), but for this month’s Reality Frights, I’ve got a wonderfully seasonal game for you. It’s the brand-new remake of the grand old mystery puzzler The 7th Guest, a game which Bill Gates notably referred to as “The new standard of interactive entertainment.” In fairness to ol’ William, he said this seven months before Doom blew out the new standard’s insides with a 12-gauge shotgun, shunting PC gamers’ tastes away from kitsch adventure games and toward grisly murder-fests. But The 7th Guest is nonetheless fondly remembered for its spooky atmosphere, alongside its blend of pre-rendered backgrounds and live action cutscenes you could call ‘pioneering’ had it not proved such an evolutionary dead end.
Today, the original 7th Guest looks more dated than Henry VIII, which is probably why this remake replaces everything but the very skeleton of the 1993 original. The game still takes place in a creepy mansion belonging to a murderous toymaker, and still involves six eccentric guests to the house searching for a missing boy named Tad. But it’s otherwise been completely rebuilt, with whole new puzzles and whole new mechanics, all designed to be experienced in first-person VR.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If there's one genre I've never quite had the reflexes or spatial awareness for, it's the bullet hell shooter. I've long admired their intricate dances of orbs and criss-crossing laser fire, but I have long resigned myself to merely being a spectator of such games, rather than an active ship pilot. Cobalt Core, however, is exactly my kind of speed. It's not a bullet hell shooter, but it is about two spaceships facing off against each other in an eyes-locked duel of incoming cannon fire, and sliding side to side to avoid getting exploded as you attempt to unravel the mysterious timeloop your crew of weird space animals appear to be stuck in. Just, you know, in a neat, turn-based fashion, where your opponent's attacks are flagged up in advance, and you must use your randomised deck of cards to weave and dodge your way to victory. It's very moreish, and very Into The Breach. I love it.

According to a new financial briefing from the company, it plans to support the Switch seemingly long after the release of rumored new-gen hardware expected to launch next year. 
It's been a big week for Nintendo, with the company revealing that Super Mario Bros. Wonder is the fastest-selling Super Mario game in the series and that a live-action Legend of Zelda movie is on the way. We also learned yesterday the Switch has surpassed 132 million units sold on the heels of great results for The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and Pikmin 4. Now, Nintendo has pulled back the curtains a bit on its approach to the Switch platform moving forward.

The next game from developer Arbitrary Metric, Roman Sands RE:Build, is... very different, at least on the surface.


The first Act of the new Steam demo sees you staggering onto the beach below some kind of tropical resort. You wander up past the pools to the cavernous lobby and are immediately set upon by haggard guests, who appear to think you're a member of staff. So you become a member of staff, fetching margaritas, tracking down the check-in ledger and running downstairs to adjust the boiler settings. You earn XP from quests towards employee ranks that unlock useful items at vending machines. And you try to work out what you're doing here, and why everybody's so terrified of the sun. I haven't deciphered the mystery yet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rockstar Games will release the first trailer for its highly anticipated sequel to 2013's Grand Theft Auto V, which became the most profitable entertainment product of all time in 2018, next month. As of August, Grand Theft Auto V has sold more than 185 million copies since its release 10 years ago. 
Official news of this trailer from the Rockstar Twitter account comes less than a day after a Bloomberg report that states Rockstar will reveal the sequel, presumably titled Grand Theft Auto VI or Grand Theft Auto 6, this week with a trailer for it arriving sometime next month; Since the release of this report yesterday, Rockstar has confirmed a trailer for the next Grand Theft Auto will, in fact, be released in December. 
We are very excited to let you know that in early December, we will release the first trailer for the next Grand Theft Auto. We look forward to many more years of sharing these experiences with all of you.
November 8, 2023
Game Informer has reached out to Rockstar's parent company Take-Two Interactive to ask about this report and reveal and will update the story if more information is learned. 
The journey to the reveal of the next Grand Theft Auto has not happened quietly. In September of last year, unprecedented leaks gave fans a potential look at the sequel in over 90 videos showcasing secret in-development footage of the open-world crime sequel.  We also learned last year that the game reportedly stars a female protagonist. Bloomberg says this Grand Theft Auto V sequel is set in a fictional version of Miami and features the aforementioned female protagonist as well as a male protagonist. 


While waiting to learn more about Rockstar's next game, read Game Informer's Grand Theft Auto V review and then read our thoughts on Red Dead Redemption II. After that, read Game Informer's ranking of every single Rockstar game.

So. Over the past 12 months or so I got very sick and it didn't go away. Eventually I was diagnosed with severe heart failure, most likely from a virus. It will continue to greatly limit me for the foreseeable future and as such I've had to stop working in the manner I once did.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The open world co-op survival game I liked most was Wurm Online, in which every action was performed via a right-click menu and we needed a town meeting to discuss who would spend the hours necessary to flatten a small patch of land. 

I therefore look at co-op survival game Enshrouded, with its voxel building, grapple hooks, wingsuits, and think: pah, what tomfoolery. This looks fun. Not at all my sort of thing. It might be yours, though. It's now got a January 24th release date and a new trailer, below.

        <updated>2023-11-07T18:57:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, Ubisoft is the latest developer to join 2023's wave of layoffs. According to IGN, the company laid off a total of 124 employees. 98 of them were based in Canada, which IGN calculates as roughly 2% of the company's Canadian workforce. The cuts included administrative and IT workers, some of whom were employed at the Hybride VFX studio, a company that has worked on shows like Ahsoka and The Mandalorian.


"These are not decisions taken lightly and we are providing comprehensive support for our colleagues who will be leaving Ubisoft during this transition," the company told both IGN and Kotaku. "We also want to share our utmost gratitude and respect for their many contributions to the company. This restructuring does not affect our production teams." Another quote obtained by Kotaku claims that the layoffs are to allow Ubisoft to "to optimize its resources to be more sustainable in the long term."
This news comes after a year of several big Ubisoft releases, including Assassin's Creed Mirage, The Crew: Motorfest, and Just Dance 2024, but that's in spite of the fact that they canceled several games this year and delayed Skull and Bones... again. Unrest at the company has been ongoing as well: back in September, IGN reported widespread frustration after employees were suddenly called to return to in-person working conditions.
Ubisoft now joins Bungie, Media Molecule, Telltale Games, Team17, Epic Games, Naughty Dog, Microsoft, and more on the unfortunately long list of companies that have laid people off in the past year.

The word "anacrusis" refers to a set of syllables that precede the first metrical foot in a line of poetry - an intriguing moniker for a game that is essentially Valve's Left 4 Dead, but set in a 1970s-styled high tech facility reminiscent of No One Lives Forever. I'll be honest, I haven't been keeping up with The Anacrusis, and assumed that it was one of those top-drawer philosophical puzzlers. Come on, there isn't even a pun in the title!

Resident Evil Village hit the App Store just last week, and today, Capcom has let us know when Resident Evil 4 Remake is coming to the platform: December 20. You can see some screenshots from the Apple port below. 

The game won't be available to all iPhone owners, however. Resident Evil 4 Remake will only be available on the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max, meaning you'll have to grab the newest product in order to play this game on the go. That said, it will also be available on iPads and Macs with the M1 chip or later. If you're a diehard Apple fan and have multiple RE4 Remake compatible products, you'll be happy to know that the game also supports cross-progression between Apple devices, so you can start a save file on your Mac at home and pick it up on your phone when you're on the go.
The game is available for pre-order on the App Store now, but players will be able to start the game for free before committing to a full purchase. Its recently released DLC, Separate Ways, will launch alongside it as well. While we haven't been able to go hands-on with this version of the game quite yet, we like Resident Evil 4 Remake quite a lot: you can read our review for it right here.]]></summary>

I can almost see Croteam's writing team now, chuckling inwardly to themselves as they do a big silent wink to camera from behind the robot's eyes. You're not fooling me, Croteam. I'm here to solve puzzles and discuss philosophy, and I know you are too. You can't stop talking about philosophy in this game, and frankly, I wouldn't have it any other way. 
Millenia may have passed since the events of The Talos Principle, but the problems faced by this new society of advanced robo-humans (of which you are number 1000 to be 'born' into this world) still feel all too relevant to the issues posed by the lives we're living today: what is the price of progress? Will we ignore the mistakes of the past and push the world toward irreparable destruction? And why have cats remained loyal to this new race of robo-people, cementing their status as the superior future pet, when dogs have devolved back into vicious wolves? There are some puzzles too, I guess. Those are pretty great as well.

When the original Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl came out in 2021, it was a relatively bare-bones experience, but those bones were solid. Despite lacking many single-player modes, items, and even character voices, the core gameplay was good enough to keep the game afloat until it received refinements via online updates over the next two years. Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2, however, comes packaged with all those improvements and more. Developer Fair Play Labs has learned its lessons, and while the game isn't without its faults, it's a more-than-worthy follow-up.

After a recent patch a few weeks ago that made the game easier and added in some Halloween festivity, developer Hexworks and publisher CI Games have released its schedule of content for the game and it includes new questlines, two new events, more armor and weapons, and more. 
The roadmap also includes a "regular weekly cadence of updates focusing on bringing further stability, performance optimization, and balancing improvements to the game, including its online crossplay experience." 


Stopping short of specifics, Hexworks says before the year's end, it will add multiple new quest lines to Lords of the Fallen, with the opportunity to unlock some unique armor sets and weapons. The studio says some of this armor and weaponry has been co-created with the community during recent collaborative livestreams. Plus, the studio says "players can look forward to 12 new spells, new finisher attacks, and a whole host of community-requested features, including the recently revealed New Game Plus (NG+) modifier system – a first for the genre, and highly anticipated by the Lords of the Fallen community." 
"At Hexworks, we're incredibly proud of the open relationship we're fostering with our community," studio head Saül Gascon writes in a press release. "We are actively listening to their constructive feedback and working diligently to deliver what we believe, collectively, will elevate Lords of the Fallen further. Every addition to the game is a labor of love, as we strive to push both it and the genre's boundaries."

Alan Wake 2 Update 1.0.9 
PlayStation 5: Update 1.00.09
Xbox Series X/S: Update 1.0.0.9
PC: Update 1.0.9
Xbox Series – A workaround fix for the issue where the audio cut out intermittently in the Prologue. We are expecting a full fix for this issue in an upcoming update.
Room 665 – Fixed an issue (again) with the Echo scene not aligning and unlocking correctly (this was fixed in the previous update, but Echo hell still persisted)  
Local Girl – Fixed an issue with a mouse (with a big presence) blocking progress.
And that's everything in the latest Alan Wake 2 update. Catch up on everything the Alan Wake 2 update from last week fixed with the game here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Switch continues to inch closer to becoming Nintendo's best-selling hardware ever, as it has now surpassed 132 million units sold. It did so thanks to great software sales for new first-party games released this year like The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and Pikmin 4. 
This news comes from Nintendo's Fiscal Year 2024 second quarter financial results, which ended September 30. In it, we learn the Switch has officially reached 132.46 million units sold, getting it closer to the company's best-selling hardware, the Nintendo DS at 154.02 million units sold. The only other console above the DS overall is the PlayStation 2 at roughly 158 million units sold. 


It's possible the Switch reaches the DS' numbers, assuming a new-gen console doesn't end sales of the hardware. And consider…]]></summary>

The developers in question are a mixture of former full-time staff and former Keywords Studios QA testers who have worked on Dreadwolf under contract. They've organised pickets outside BioWare Edmonton's offices in Canada, and are calling on BioWare fans to get involved on social media, while trying to engage current BioWare staff in conversation about unionisation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlayStation integration with X (formerly known as Twitter) is ending for PS5 and PS4 next week via a new update. That means users will no longer be able to directly upload screenshots and video clips from the console to the social media site.
An announcement update posted to the PlayStation Support page states that on Monday, November 13, X integration will end, which includes the ability to “view any content published on X on PS5/PS4, and the ability to post and view content, trophies, and other gameplay-related activities on X directly from PS5/PS4 (or link an X account to do so).”
While a bummer for those who make frequent use of this feature, which offers a simple method of posting gameplay content to the platform, there are a couple of more involved alternatives depending on your platform. If you’re a PS5 user, you can still use the PlayStation mobile app to upload gameplay captures to then post on X. You can read how to do that here. PS4 users have to rely on ShareFactory and do a bit more work, and you can read those steps here.
Microsoft made the same move in April by disabling sharing to X directly from the console and instructing players to instead use the Xbox app on mobile (with some speculating the decision was made to avoid paying the platform's then-new monthly application programming interface (API) fee). This now means that the Switch will become the sole console that supports direct media sharing to X. 
What do you think about the decision to end X integration? Did you use this feature regularly? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blizzard Entertainment has revealed that the first expansion for Diablo IV is called Vessel of Hatred, and it hits the game late next year. The Diablo team revealed this news over the weekend during BlizzCon 2023, which is also where we learned about three new World of Warcraft expansions and three new Overwatch 2 heroes coming to the game. 
During BlizzCon 2023, Blizzard kept Vessel of Hatred details light, stating it will share more details next summer. As for what to expect, it features a campaign that continues the dark tale that began in Diablo IV. "Vessel of Hatred brings players back to learn the fate of the prime evil Mephisto and his demonic plans for Sanctuary," a press release reads. "Travel to the lush jungles known by the locals as Nahantu." 
Check out the Diablo IV: Vessel of Hatred expansion announcement trailer for yourself below: 


Blizzard says Vessel of Hatred will allow players to traverse an exotic new region, vanquish new evils, and perhaps most excitingly, explore fresh ways to kill demons and loot chests with a completely new Class "never seen before in the Diablo universe." 
And that's all Blizzard shared about Vessel of Hatred. Diablo IV's first expansion is due out in late 2024. 
For more about the game, read Game Informer's Diablo IV review and then check out this story about how Diablo IV (and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III) won't be coming to Xbox Game Pass this year, even though Xbox now owns Activision Blizzard. Read about the ongoing Diablo IV Season of Blood after that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blizzard Entertainment has revealed the next three heroes of Overwatch 2, including Mauga, a new duel-wielding tank hero that hits the game next month. Plus, the Overwatch 2 team teased a new DPS hero and Support hero hitting the roster sometime down the line. 
Mauga was actually playable for free as a part of a limited-time trial run for the tank hero this past weekend, but he's already out of the game; his real debut happens alongside Overwatch 2's Season 8 launch on December 5. "Equipped with two chain guns (Gunny and Cha-Cha), Mauga is ready to bash through the front lines of his opponents and tear through anyone that stands in his way with tons of fire-power," Blizzard says about the hero. 
Watch the official Mauga gameplay trailer below: 


Here are some additional Mauga screens from Overwatch 2: 

Elsewhere during the Overwatch 2 BlizzCon 2023 presentation, which is where Mauga was revealed, Blizzard pulled back the curtains on two more heroes coming to the game sometime in the future. The first is a DPS hero named Venture, with a unique Splatoon-ish weapon: 
The second is a new support hero codenamed Space Ranger, and given this hero does not yet have an official title, it's the hero we're expecting to debut in Overwatch 2 last out of these new ones. 
The final piece of Overwatch 2 from BlizzCon 2023 is Clash, a new PvP mode where two teams are tasked with capturing five distinct points on a map. Perhaps most excitingly, Blizzard is bringing back Overwatch map Hanamura as playable in Clash, except under the new name Hanaoka. Here's a look at Hanaoka below: 
For more about BlizzCon 2023, read about the three World of Warcraft expansions announced during the event. After that, read Game Informer's Overwatch 2 review, and then check out our Diablo IV review.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I reviewed Hunt: Showdown for a different parish back in 2019, it was a swampy, stealthy, slow-paced extraction FPS that consisted of weaving through mouldy undead and pockets of inconveniently noisy wildlife, ears pricked for the rustle of a rival player in the bushes. It was a game in which every footfall felt like a gamble and every second lasted an eternity, even before you entered the lair of a giant spider. Fast  forward to 2023, and streamers are playing Hunt: Showdown like it's Titanfall 2, scurrying along walls with scant regard for the NPC cannon fodder below, duelling each other on rooftops with pistol shotguns, and tearing through those poor, befuddled boss monsters like sandcastles.


Thus the fate of any competitive shooter lucky enough to acquire a seasoned pro following, I guess. But still, returning to Crytek's PvPvE shooter has been a shock, and speaking to the development team, it sounds like the devs themselves have been struggling to keep up with the more ambitious players, too. Showdown was never expected to endure quite this long and evolve in quite this way, according to general manager David Fifield, and managing the community's ambitions for the game is as much of a challenge as compensating for the limitations of its ageing engine.

Naturally, those experiments devolved from a noble effort to remove the stain of cars into a sadistic urge to drive thousands of my own people on a never-ending hell march.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are very pleased to announce today the start of the testing period of two single-game engines: Kingdom: The Far Reaches and Escape From Hell!
Kingdom, was developed and released by Interplay in 1995. Only the DOS version of the game (available on gog.com) is supported. It's a cartoon FMV game, with an inventory, in which you have to guide Lathan Kandor through a medieval world, discovering the magic spells and the items required to defeat an evil wizard. 
Escape From Hell, was developed for Electronic Arts by the game veterans Richard Seaborne and Alan Murphy and was released in 1990. You play Alan in this keyboard-only Role Playing Game and visit Hell, looking for your girlfriend who was accidentally teleported there.
Both games use heavily hardcoded logic which is error prone and requires a lot of testing, so we need your feedback more than ever as they are both incompletely tested. There is sadly only one known demo for Kingdom. Support for the Windows and Mac versions of Kingdom may come later! Please contact us if you have some other demos of both games.
To play any of these games, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker and please take some screenshots along the way!

In dozens of local and international news reports, this 'official' figure is cited verbatim. We have zero faith in it, and we aren't alone. After a silent unreferenced edit, the police press release now reads €366,250, but the government's copy remains intact.
