        <id>https://www.destructoid.com/?p=347477</id>
        <link href="https://www.destructoid.com/silent-hill-transmission-october-19-2022/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=silent-hill-transmission-october-19-2022"/>
        <updated>2022-10-16T22:09:51.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Straight from the horse's mouth
Since the premature death of Silent Hills and the P.T. demo, we've seen a constant stream of supposed leaks and rumors about what will be the next Silent Hill game. Plenty of people claim to have inside information, but this Wednesday, we'll hear it directly from the people who actually run the show. Konami dropped word on Sunday that a Silent Hill Transmission will broadcast on October 19 and will feature "the latest updates for the Silent Hill series."
https://twitter.com/Konami/status/1581754864702398464
It's anybody's guess what we'll see in the show, but I'd put my money on Konami pulling back the curtain on that recently uncovered Silent Hill: The Short Message product listing. Could The Short Message be a new game or a remake of one of the previous games in the series? Is it that Abandoned game we've all stopped making fun of? I used the Silent Hill: Shattered Memories key art in the banner image because Sam Barlow mentioned a follow-up to that masterpiece in the past. And Masahiro Ito seems to be aware of it. I guess as long as Konami isn't revealing a new pachinko machine, it should be worth tuning in for.
The Silent Hill franchise has been in purgatory for about a decade following the release of Downpour and Book of Memories in 2012. Hideo Kojima famously tried to take the reigns of the franchise in 2014 with Silent Hills, but following a well-publicized fallout with Konami, he left the company and the project behind to form his own studio. There have been many rumors of Kojima creating a Silent Hill game over at Kojima Productions, but there's not been anything concrete on that front.
Whatever it is, fans won't have to wait long. The Silent Hill Transmission is set for October 19 at 2:00 pm Pacific.

Because we live in an era where so many of the best things in life carry more baggage than a member of the royal family going on a weekend holiday, there are now calls for a boycott of Bayonetta 3 coming from the actor who gave Cereza her voice in the English-speaking world. As was recently reported, voice actor Jennifer Hale is taking the reins of the title character in this month's big Switch release.
In an interview with Game Informer, Yusuke Miyata, who is directing the series' third entry, said Hale was offered the role because "Various overlapping circumstances made it difficult for Hellena Taylor to reprise her role." Today, Taylor, who was the English Bayonetta voice actress in the first two games of the series as well as Anarchy Reigns,…]]></summary>

You’re rolling the dice whenever you pick up a game with “Simulator” in the title. Is this going to be an attempt at accurately translating something into a video game, or is it going to abandon all reason and present some sort of unhinged parody? Priest Simulator is definitely in the latter category, but rather than just having some wacky controls that make the whole performance absurd, it goes a few steps further, into a storm drain, and gets washed out to sea.
You technically get up to some priest business in Priest Simulator. One could also argue that you even play as a priest. Maybe my knowledge of priestly happenings is skewed in some way, but if you asked me what a priest does, my answer would be: not this.

One of Bayonetta 3’s most head-scratching elements is Platinum’s decision to switch Bayonetta’s voice actor from Hellena Taylor to Jennifer Hale. Taylor played the Umbra Witch in the first two games, but Platinum explained in our cover story that she wouldn’t reprise the role due to “various overlapping circumstances.” Taylor had been largely quiet on the issue, presumably due to a non-disclosure agreement, but has broken her silence with a fiery message claiming “immoral” compensation from Platinum as the reason her role was recast.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Featuring Mario and his Mushroom Kingdom friends.
The Mario games have been a core part of Nintendo fandom for decades now. Mario as a solo sibling has been around for even longer than his own series, first appearing — of course — as Jumpman in 1981's Donkey Kong.
Despite having his name in the title, the Mario franchise isn't about the Italian plumber alone. He was joined by his faithful brother Luigi in the first Mario Bros. arcade game in 1983, who also has a successful franchise of his own with the Luigi’s Mansion series. As well as that double trouble duo, you've got Princess Peach, Toad, Yoshi, and a bunch of antagonists to bop on the head as you run and jump your way through the Mushroom Kingdom. This cast of characters can also get quite competitive, whether playing Tennis or Golf or screaming around the track in a Mario Kart.

Existing default picks Steve and Alex are going to be joined by seven new characters who reflect the wider world, although Mojang wouldn’t reveal any more about them ahead of today's Minecraft Live stream. Not even their names, alas. I was going to suggest Pugh, Pugh, Barney McGrew, Cuthbert, Dibble and Grub, but then realised that leaves one short. Gandalf, maybe?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["$4000 USD...this is an insult to me".
Earlier this month, PlatinumGames confirmed Hellena Taylor would not be returning as the voice of Bayonetta in the third outing Bayonetta 3 due to "various overlapping circumstances". In an update, the voice actor has now directly responded to this - taking to social media to explain in her own words why she didn't voice the character in the third game.
Long story short, she feels the offer of $4,000 USD "to do the whole game...as a flat rate" was an "insult" to her, and the amount of time she took to work on her talent and everything she had given to the fans and series. She also claims the "Bayonetta franchise made an approximated $450 million dollars...not including merchandise".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It means "village romanticization".
In an age where it feels like many big-budget projects are falling victim to 'FOMO mechanics' and stricter price schemes, it can be refreshing to play a game that focuses on simplicity, like Dorfromantik. Here you have a puzzle game that doesn't chase after complex mechanics, cutting-edge design, or intense action; Dorfromantik is simply about building warm, rural countrysides at your own pace. No pressure. No noise. And though it sacrifices some of its long-term appeal with this approach, we commend Dorfromantik for committing wholly to the peaceful atmosphere it endeavors to create.
Based around a simple score-based puzzle, you start off with a single hex tile floating in space and your goal is simply to build out a countryside as far as you possibly can by adding to it. Each hex tile in your stack has a collection of things like houses, forests, or rivers on its various edges and you get points for each edge you can match to an already placed tile.

I’ve been to Hooters at some point during my teen years. I can tell you that all the hormones in the world would not take away from how awkward I felt. I’d say it was mutual shame, like getting your genitals waxed, but I don’t know who would take that job not feeling comfortable with the implications. So, the shame was all me. It’s like going to a strip club; I understand the purpose, but I’m still afraid to make eye contact. At the very least, I respect a place that moves ogling out of parks and beaches and into a consensual environment, but I have damage in the ogling center of my brain.
Believe it or not, Hooters actually had a video game. Sort of like how McDonald’s had McDonald’s Treasure Land Adventure, except instead of mascots, there are tits. …]]></summary>

In the years since we first ventured out onto the great plains of a truly open Hyrule in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, we’ve found all the shrines, defeated Calamity Ganon and scoured the kingdom for every last item and Korok seed. We’ve seen it all — and we went back to see it again in Labo VR — and now we’re looking for something else to scratch that Zelda itch. Tears of the Kingdom is coming, of course, but we need another hit.
We’re sure many of you can sympathise. A Zelda game is an event to savour, and the wait for the next entry can be tough. Breath of the Wild’s open world lasted us longer than most, but we’re getting anxious for another action-RPG fix. The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening was short and sweet, and Skyward Sword HD helped some, but we want more.

We did it, everyone. We made it through the working week with only 306 Pokémon Scarlet and Violet news drops to write of - perhaps this is a slight over-exaggeration, but you get the picture.

This week we were lucky enough to head behind the scenes at Ubisoft to get a look at Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope as the game nears release. We also got all nostalgic over the passing trend of hearing licensed music in video games, and we got a chance to chat to Sea Power - the geniuses behind Disco Elysium's soundtrack.

Overwatch 2 got off to a bumpy start, but in terms of the game's launch population, the sequel has apparently set an "all-time record" - reaching 25 million players in the first ten days of the game's availability.
In an official Blizzard press release, it was mentioned how this number was "nearly triple" the previous daily player peak" from the original Overwatch. Here's what company president Mike Ybarra had to say about this milestone:

Nintendo has taken the servers for Switch Sports down, suspending online play and save data backup while it investigates a new issues causing crashes.
As shared across the different Nintendo social accounts, a bug has been found in the latest Ver. 1.2.1 update of Nintendo Switch Sports. It's been causing crashes during the pre-match loading screen, affecting both online and offline play.
While Nintendo has suspended the roll-out of the update, it's also taking servers down temporarily while it investigates. Online play will not be available, obviously, and save data backup will be suspended as well.
https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1580939363797504000
A quick pause in play
Ver. 1.2.1 for Switch Sports was released earlier this week, on October 12. Its goal was to strengthen measures against disruptive behaviors. That entails any violations of Nintendo's Community Guidelines, including fraudulent behavior, including save data manipulation.
The previous update, Ver. 1.2.0, added a fair bit to the Wii Sports successor. One-on-one and four-on-four soccer got leg strap support, volleyball received a new slide attack move, and some nice features were added for online play.
In our review of Nintendo Switch Sports, it sounds like while the single-player progression wasn't the most rewarding, it still had a good bit to offer for multiplayer gatherings. And honestly, who doesn't have fond memories of bowling?
Hopefully the online sees a fix soon. Meanwhile, Nintendo Switch Sports is still due to receive its golf update, which was pushed out of September but should arrive sometime in the holiday season.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Reeled back in before it got out
Nvidia has announced it is "unlaunching" one of its upcoming graphics cards. The RTX 4080 12 GB card was one of two 4080s set to launch next month, but Nvidia is halting the smaller of the two.
"The RTX 4080 12GB is a fantastic graphics card, but it’s not named right," reads a statement from Nvidia. "Having two GPUs with the 4080 designation is confusing."
So the 12 GB card will be "unlaunched," and the Nvidia RTX 4080 16 GB will still arrive on November 16.
The 4090, meanwhile, went live on October 12 and has been reviewing pretty alright as the powerhouse of the new line.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glz5B-4IlKE
What's in a name?
The name is one obvious distinction, as having two somewhat similar-sounding cards might be one issue. But the 12 GB and 16 GB configurations are actually a bit more different than the names might imply.
The hardware folks over at Digital Foundry did a breakdown of the distinctions between the two cards, as well as the 24 GB RTX 4090.
While the names imply a difference in VRAM, the 12 and 16 GB are actually fairly different cards. They have different core processors, with "wild variations" in the compute power and memory bandwidth. Nvidia's own benchmarks have been a bit weird too, compared to the previous 3000 generation of cards.
Suffice to say, it sounds like there were a lot of questions and concerns around this particular model, and Nvidia is taking the option to shelve it. Focus can all go back on to the 16 GB card and the 4090 that way.

Overwatch 2's launch has been nothing short of tumultuous, which game-breaking bugs and supposed DDoS attacks abound. There's still a lot left to be cleaned up, and while Blizzard has been clear that they're working to improve the game and fix the bugs as fast as they can, the company has made it clear that they won't be tweaking character stats or abilities for a couple of months.
A blog post from Blizzard's website (via Eurogamer) let players in on how the devs are feeling about the current state of the game -- when it comes to hero balancing, "[they] have been happy to see that no hero’s overall power level is far out of line with [their] goals."

Dead Space celebrates its anniversary today, and so EA Motive showed off a little more of its upcoming remake of the first game. Today we got an in-depth look at the remade Dead Space, highlighting zero-G movement, peeling, and the Intensity Director.
In the section shown off, Isaac is trying to get back to the Refueling Station. This entails going back through the Machine Shop, which means backtracking. And as the developer points out in the voice-over, things may change a bit.
Different enemies may be around. Lighting and ambiance may have changed. The frights are a little less static, and rooms already traversed once are not safe forever.

Are you adequately prepared to rock? Arc System Works sure hopes so, as next week will see the publisher launch an open beta to test the rollback netcode update for its excellent anime fighter Guilty Gear Xrd Rev 2 — The beta will kick off October 17 on the Steam release of the 2017 smasher.
While ArcSys is currently enjoying the fruits of more recent entry Guilty Gear Strive, its predecessor is still tightly-held by many of the GG faithful as one of, if not the, finest entry in the long-running fighting game franchise. Recognizing this, the developer is taking steps to ensure that those players who still wish to party like it's 2017 are afforded the best experience available, with the same silky smooth netcode that younger brother GG Strive offers.
To get folks in gear (pun fully intended) for the beta, ArcSys is also holding a slew of discounts on the Guilty Gear Steam back catalog. New and veteran players can bag several titles including Guilty Gear Xrd Rev 2, Guilty Gear XX Accent Core Plus R, and BlazBlue Cross Tag Battle, alongside their respective DLC, for hugely discounted prices. It should be noted that none of these games feature the new and improved version of Testament, but Baiken and Bridget are in the mix, so they're well worth your dollarydoos.
Prepare to meet Elphelt. Be very afraid.
Guilty Gear Xrd Rev 2 is available now on PS4 and PC. The rollback netcode beta test will take place from October 17 to October 31. In addition, Guilty Gear Strive is available now on PlayStation and PC platforms, with an Xbox port arriving in spring 2023.

A new Pokemon for the Paldea region makes its debut. Bellibolt, the EleFrog Pokemon, will be debuting in Pokemon Scarlet and Violet.
The new monster-pal for Paldea was teased earlier this week in a video, spotlighting the region's Electric-type Gym Leader Iono. Today, the Leader/influencer/streamer Iono returns to debut just what her partner Pokemon is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkfN-jyEcrI
Bellibolt is, as you can tell, an Electric-type frog. As Iono notes, those giant bumps on the side of its head are not eyes.
Instead, its actual face is that little smiley face you see in the middle, above its electricity-generating belly. A Bellibolt can expand and contract, generating electricity for shocking attacks it discharges from those bumps.
Its ability, Electromorphosis, is a new one. When Bellibolt is hit by an attack, it charges up, boosting the power of its next Electric-type move. Seems like it could be an interesting frontline tank for your Pokemon party.

A new pal in Paldea
Bellibolt is another in a string of reveals for Pokemon Scarlet and Violet. We've been gradually meeting more and more of the newcomers over the last few months. Pokemon like Wiglett, Grafaiai, and more are in store.
Plus, we're also getting a good look at some of the people living in Paldea too. Iono is the third Gym Leader we've seen so far, and will act as one of several the player will need to topple along Victory Road.
From auto-battling and TM crafting to the glorious lil' buddy called Lechonk, we're getting a pretty good idea of what's ahead for Pokemon Scarlet and Violet. The new generation of Pokemon games isn't too far off, either.
Pokemon Scarlet and Violet go live on Nintendo Switch on November 18, 2022.

It's fair to say that when OlliOlli World was released back in February of this year, we loved it (check out or 9/10 star review if you don't believe us)! After the sweet sci-fi expansion in May's 'Void Riders', we are pleased to hear that another expansion is on its way - if not a little upset to hear that it will be the game's last one.
Publisher Private Division released a tweet today detailing 'Finding the Flowzone', the next nautical-themed add-on to come to the game on November 2nd. Not to do things by halves, this announcement came in the form of the purest art - an original sea shanty.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Front Mission 2: Remake screens have appeared on the official Nintendo Store listing
While footage of the upcoming Front Mission remakes has been slim, new Front Mission 2: Remake screens give us a better look at the project. The screens come directly from the Nintendo Store listing, which was updated recently.
In case you haven't played the Front Mission franchise before, it's a classic tactical strategy game from G-Craft/Square Enix (then Squaresoft). It was wildly successful at the time, especially among SRPG fans, which led to these very remakes being dug up in the modern era. Developer Storm Trident and publisher Forever Entertainment (alongside of Square Enix) are handling the remakes.
Here's a quick brief on the second game, which takes place 12 years after the original:
"12 years have passed since the second Huffman conflict. The impoverished People's Republic of Alordesh has been suffering a severe economic decline ever since the war ended. In June 2102, soldiers of the Alordesh Army rise up and, led by Ven Mackarge, declare independence from the O.C.U. (Oceania Cooperative Union)."

As a reminder, Front Mission 1st: Remake is out in November, and Front Mission 2: Remake will be arriving in 2023. Nintendo also announced a Front Mission 3 remake project slated for "the future," though no window is in sight.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Evolution Halted
Citing 'unexpected challenges', Sega, Aspyr Media, and developer Amplitude Studios have announced that the console release of epic strategy title Humankind will no longer meet its November 2022 release date — No timeframe was offered as to when the PlayStation and Xbox ports would see the light of day.
"We and our partners have run into unexpected challenges in porting Humankind to consoles, and have to delay the release on Playstation 4/5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S until further notice," reads an unfortunate statement on the game's official blog.
"We know this will be frustrating for many of you, but we believe this delay is for the best, as we want to make sure to provide the best possible experience to console players. Unfortunately, we're not in a position to give a timeframe on a new release date right now, but we will update you all as soon as we can. In the meantime, anybody who has pre-purchased on digital storefronts will receive a refund where applicable in line with platform policy."
Officially launching on PC in the summer of 2021, Humankind is an evolutionary strategy simulation that is similar in fashion to the popular Civilization series, and tasks players with evolving Man as a species from rocks and fire through to the most contemporary and technologically sound eras imaginable. Of course, being human, there are plenty of pitfalls and barriers en route, including politics, famine, disease, and man's seemingly most popular pastime, war.
While critics were a little down on Humankind's "safe" approach to the evolutionary strategy genre, the title was praised regardless for its gameplay, structure, and general thematics. Now available to purchase on PC via Steam, PlayStation and Xbox players will have to stay tuned for further news of the troubled console port.

The presentation featured an extended guided walkthrough showing off new gameplay footage as well as a rundown of features designed to make the game more terrifying than ever. 
The video’s side-by-side comparisons illustrate the major differences between the original and the remake. One big change is that the Ishimura is now a seamless, interconnected ship that players can explore more freely. For example, using Isaac’s rocket thrusters to soar through areas you could only walk through before. A new system called the Intensity Spawn Director remixes necromorph spawn points, ensuring they’ll ambush veteran players in unexpected ways and, sometimes, in greater numbers. Dead Space also features improved necromorph dismemberment, new side quests designed to flesh out the supporting cast, new alternate fire modes for weapons, new puzzles, and more.

You've likely seen similar games, but this one mixes the usual 2D pixel puzzle business with some hazardous platforming, and a cloning system that rapidly move beyond the obvious "standing on your own shoulders" uses.
The balancing of all that didn't quite work for me, but I'm generally fairly averse to puzzle games and demanding platformers, so you ought not to count that against it. If you're more the type to take apart a puzzle step by step than to wing it while your subconscious yells from the sidelines, this could even be a real gem.

Fledgling studio Dramatic Labs has announced that its graphic adventure game Star Trek: Resurgence will no longer meet its 2022 release date — The space opera adaptation will now launch in April 2023 on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.
"Production has been advancing steadily all summer, but we have made the difficult decision to move our release date out of 2022 in order to give the game a final coat of polish, and create a truly immersive Star Trek experience," writes the developer in a statement posted to Twitter.
"Our love and admiration for Star Trek is instrumental to this decision. We're proud of what we've accomplished so far, and this continues to be a passion project for everyone here. We are incredibly grateful — and excited — to be able to work within a universe that means so much to so many. We can't wait for you to see it all and look forward to taking you on an adventure unlike any Star Trek game that's come before."
Originally revealed at The Game Awards just last year, Star Trek: Resurgence is a narrative experience in the vein of Telltale Games' litany of choice-based adventure games. Studio Dramatic Labs is itself made up of former Telltale Games employees, and thus one can likely expect the people politics, dramatic tension, and moral decision-making of games such as The Walking Dead, The Wolf Among Us, and Batman: The Telltale Series.
Star Trek: Resurgence will launch April 2023 on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

The namesake feature of Nintendo's hybrid console has been perhaps the key factor in its continued success. The Switch's ability to, well, switch means it fits neatly into any lifestyle whatever your situation, but that doesn't mean there aren't use cases it doesn't quite cater for. For our part — and especially in the pre-Switch OLED days — we've often wished we could use our laptop screen or even play via a tablet to get a boost in screen size over the Switch's screen in tabletop mode. We're surrounded by large screens in the office, but we can't play on as many of them as we'd like.

It pits you against the Borg. It lets you visit Deep Space Nine. You can even battle the powerful and scary Crystalline Entity that wiped out Data’s homeworld. As a Trek fan, I enjoy Star Trek Online far, far too much.

Have you ever been bowling on Wii Sports and thought, 'I wish these lanes were kinda like a giant floating puzzle?' Well boy, oh boy, do we have the game for you.
Super Funky Bowling has released on the Switch eShop today, taking the principles of bowling and making it, well, funky. This is less a sports sim than it is an action-based puzzler, where you will have to navigate a series of winding lanes to knock down all of the pins.

We're at the tail end of the week already, but last week's UK chart data from GfK has just come in, and there's no change at the top as FIFA 23 retains the top spot. Not surprising in the UK — though the Switch version only makes up 8% of those sales given that it's the Legacy Edition — but Splatoon 3 is still comfortably in second.
Last week's (2nd - 8th October) two new entries come in the form of two long-awaited Switch ports. NieR:Automata lands at 6th, with 99% of all copies sold being the Switch release (the additional 1% comes from the 2019 PS4 Game of the YoRHa Edition). And No Man's Sky enters at 8th, with 92% of sales coming from Nintendo's hybrid console. One of the best action RPGs ever and one of the biggest redemption stories in gaming, both with solid Switch ports doing well? Good news all around.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A thousand apologies, friends, for the gap in your Nate Files timeline. Unfortunately, while on a deep sea dive to retrieve the tapes of episodes 13 and 14 (an expedition funded by supporters; your generosity is always appreciated), my ship was attacked by a large and unusually toothsome whale-like creature. The cursed thing took a huge bite out of the side of our noble vessel, The Squiggled Egg, and we were forced to abandon ship. It was only by the grace of the botswain Hughbert Threads that I'm alive to write this post today, as the man gave his life beating back the foul beast, giving a large part of the rest of the crew time to get away. Alas, in the confusion, I only secured episode 14, and episode 13 is now lost to time. That is definitely what happened, and not that the digital recording got mangled somehow.
Still, episode 14 (which is now episode 13, even though I say 14 in the recording) is now here for you to enjoy. It's all about bad and obsolete palaeontology - the weird ways people in history interpreted fossils, and why.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a new trailer, the Pokémon Company and Nintendo unveiled the mystery Pokémon teased in a video earlier this week. Their name is Bellibolt, and they’re the signature partner of Iono, the newest gym leader from Pokémon Scarlet and Violet.


In Wednesday’s initial video, Iono introduced herself as not just a gym leader but also a streamer. She then asked her fictional followers to guess what her mystery partner Pokémon was based on a handful of details, including its type, the placement of its eyes, and the fact that it’s “so cute.” If you had trouble guessing, don't feel bad; today, we’ve learned that her partner is a new Pokémon altogether.
Nintendo and The Pokémon Company released a series of follow-up tweets, giving us new information about Bellibolt that sounds like it was pulled right from the Pokédex. One of the images reveals that they have a new ability called "Electromorphosis," which allows Bellibolt to power up their next electric-type move after being hit by an attack.
Say hello to the new EleFrog Pokémon, Bellibolt!

You'll be able to add Bellibolt to your team when Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet come to switch on November 18.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Star Trek: Resurgence is the latest title to get pushed into 2023. The narrative-driven sci-fi adventure will now launch in April to ensure it receives a final coat of polish.
Developer Dramatic Labs announced the news on Twitter, stating it’s taking the extra time to ensure “a truly immersive Star Trek experience”. You can read the full statement below (click the image to enlarge).
Resurgence was first announced during The Game Awards 2021 and is a choice-driven adventure game that follows a similar design template to Telltale Games’ titles (Dramatic Labs consists of ex-Telltale employees). The story unfolds shortly after the events of Star Trek: The Next Generation as players control two original characters, an officer and a commander, to solve a mystery aboard the U.S.S. Resolute. The narrative and your relationships change depending on your choices, and gameplay features light combat and puzzle-solving. Resurgence is currently slated to launch on PlayStation and Xbox consoles and PC. 
We played a demo of Star Trek: Resurgence during Summer Game Fest in June, and you can read our hands-on impressions here. You can also keep up with the plethora of big titles that have been delayed to 2023 by checking out this list.]]></summary>

It's been quite some time since Sony put together a special bundle for one of its upcoming releases, but the industry giant is preparing to do just that with the launch of one of 2022's biggest releases, God of War Ragnarok, which will be bringing its skull-crushing chaos to PS4 and PS5 November 9.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcNalDmDrBU
The new God of War Ragnarok PS5 bundle will include a disc-based edition of Sony's shiny white baby, along with a standard controller and a digital download of Sony Santa Monica's highly anticipated sequel. The price for the new bundle is yet to be disclosed. A little bafflingly, this bundle will not include the recently announced God of War DualSense controller, which will be released as a separate standalone accessory.
The bundle was revealed as part of a new "Next Gen Immersion" trailer, which spotlights God of War Ragnarok running on the powerful PS5 platform. It should be noted that Ragnarok is a multi-generational release, so PS4 players will be able to pick up the new game for their platform of choice. Given how much the 2018 original made my PS4 sound like a Boening 747 was about to land, I dread to think how much the grand-looking sequel will get the black boxes sweating.
God of War Ragnarok launches November 9 on PlayStation platforms.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Long Live the King
Gameloft has announced that it will be releasing the first major content drop for Disney Dreamlight Valley next week — Launching on PC and console platforms on October 19, the update will bring with it new story scenarios, a new Star Path, and will see the unwelcome arrival of the master of betrayal, Scar.
Scar, the antagonist of 1994's The Lion King, is the dishonorable brother of king Mufasa and the uncle of prince Simba. Wracked with jealousy and anger at his "hanger-on" status in the regal family, Scar surreptitiously befriends the hyenas of the Pridelands, ultimately executing a scheme that costs his brother his life, banishes Simba to the jungle, and sees Scar step in as king, leading to austerity, death, and the breaking of the ecologically vital "Circle of Life".
And now, he's gonna be your best pal. Thanks for that.
https://twitter.com/DisneyDLV/status/1580589187253805056?s=20&t=ftgLQxTwG0IakWIJAdC3YA
In addition to the arrival of The Lyin' King, the update will add a new "Star Path", (think Rainbow Six Siege's Battle Pass but, yknow, without all the killing?), offering up new items, decorations, and other goodies for your Animal Crossing Island Disney Dreamlight Valley. Players can also expect a new extension to the hobby title's story scenario, as well as several under-the-hood fixes, tweaking issues such from audio/visual problems to quest blockers, unresponsive NPCs, and other irritants.
Disney Dreamlight Valley is available now on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch. You can check out our own CJ Andriessen's thoughts on the game in his Early Access Review right here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You know what's quite lovely if you can afford it? Having a truly massive hard drive or SSD. Back in the day, I was over the moon when I picked up a 750MB drive for my gaming PC - I could do a full install of Civilization 2! And have room left over for X-Wing Alliance! These days, PC storage offers slightly larger capacities, but the thrill of having a really giant drive remains as strong as ever.
That brings me to the subject of today's deal post: the Crucial P3, a 4TB (!) NVMe drive capable of 3500MB/s sequential reads, is down to £299.99 at Amazon. That's a £90 reduction from its usual price, and an incredible deal for one of the biggest NVMe SSDs on the market.

Sega, in an effort to win over those still sitting on the proverbial fence, continues to roll out new trailers for its upcoming 3D adventure, Sonic Frontiers — The studio's latest trailer focuses on the skills and abilities that our iconic hero will put to use as he battles through a strange and esoteric new world.
While most fans of The Blue Blur has been happy to throw a lil' spin dashin' in harm's way, Sonic Frontiers will see the high-speed hog adopt a wide variety of new combat moves, ranging from dash kicks and punches to homing attacks, head stomps, and the return of the famous "Drop Dash" ability. Given that Sonic Frontiers' army of guardians is particularly well armored, with varying weak points, it will be up to the player to adapt to each encounter,…]]></summary>

Modern Warfare 2 players on both Battle.net and Steam will need to register a number.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hair today, gone tomorrow
Ramping up those hyper engines beyond capacity, Nintendo has released a four-minute trailer for its long-awaited sequel Bayonetta 3, ahead of the game's October 28 launch on Nintendo Switch. The new preview features the Umbra Witch in typically fine fashion, battling alongside new and familiar allies.
Titled "Bayonettas Everywhere?!" the trailer mixes fast 'n' frantic gameplay with snippets of the game's cinematics — perhaps showing a little more than is necessary, frankly. Our favorite hair-whipper is showcased battling an array of demons, monsters, and ghoulies, while tighter attention is paid to her new punk-rock protege, Viola. This young and spirited witch-in-training will accompany Bayonetta in her battle against a fearsome new enemy: the time-warping Homunculi.
You can check out the trailer below. Personally, I think it shows off a little too much story.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hh6bwdYgbio
In addition to the story and gameplay footage. The preview offers another look at the "Demon Masquerade" an ability that will allow the unholy one to channel various otherworldly beings — including demons Gomorrah, Malphas, and Phantasmaraneaeto — to both tweak her attack option and offer up brand-new combo routes, allowing our girl to switch up her battle abilities in the thick of the action.
More curiously, the trailer ends with a delightful-looking side-mode, that sees long-time Bayo pal Jeanne infiltrating a subterranean complex in delightful 2D action. The footage is reminiscent of the classic 1994 arcade release Elevator Action Returns, and is, surprisingly, one of the trailer's coolest elements. Bayonetta 3 might have teased us with the very longest of waits, but the sequel seems to be shaping up very nicely indeed. Besides, if we aren't being teased, is it even really Bayo?
Bayonetta 3 launches October 28 on Nintendo Switch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Scorn is a deliberately grim game with a lot of body horror. Best avoid it and this review if you have issues with body horror themes.
I was talking to a friend about Scorn and they asked, "Is there a story?". And yeah, Scorn has a story. At some point there'll be a two hour YouTube video outlining how it has a clear and nuanced plot, or that it's a metaphor for periods and erections, or both. In the immediate, it's about slithering out of a pod, staggering through the desert, and finding yourself in a strange, huge rotting machine made of rock and flesh that's already decades into abandonment and decay, and where most things look a bit penisy or womby. It's about the lizardy parasite latched to your back gradually transforming your body. It's about grim squishy noises and survival.
Scorn doesn't have dialogue, or a map. It doesn't really have a HUD, it doesn't have quest markers, and your character will not, upon seeing a strange new device, say something like "Hmm... seems like a key. Maybe if I find the two missing ones, it'll open up a way forward!" out loud. It won't even pull focus to the corridor you should check next. You just have to look around, experiment, and figure it out. I think I like it. I don't know if I can recommend it.

I make it no secret that farming/community simulators are one of my favorite genres, and this year has been full of sweet little games for me to cozy up on the couch with. Potion Permit is one of the titles I was looking forward to ever since I saw the first trailer, which showed off the game’s beautiful pixel art and colorful cast of characters. When it came to the gameplay itself, it looked to be pretty standard fare for the genre, with the exception of the farming side of things. In its place, the foraging and combat take center stage, as well as character-driven questlines.
Fortunately I was able to get a Switch copy of Potion Permit, because it’s one of those games that feels like it was made for a handheld console. It’s a great game to play when you have a few min…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Ryzen 7 5800X was a great gaming CPU when it launched in 2020, and it remains one of the fastest options going despite the recent release of Ryzen 7000 processors late last month. The 5800X also has two major advantages: it works on a wide range of cheap motherboards with DDR4 RAM, and it's way cheaper than the 7700X - especially when it's discounted on Ebay US, as is the case today!
So: let's cut to the chase. The 5800X is down to $229.99 at Ebay, from a list price of $449, meaning it's nearly 50% off. That also makes it $170 cheaper than the equivalent Ryzen 7000 processor, the $400 eight-core Ryzen 7700X. Or, to put it another way, you're paying around 60% of the price for at least 80% of the gaming performance of that newer CPU - not bad, given that you'll also pay way less for a complete Ryzen 5000 system (with AM4 motherboards and DDR4) than a complete Ryzen 7000 one (with AM5 motherboards and DDR5).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[GinoMachino managed to do it, though
The Godskin Duo can be a huge barrier for first-time Elden Ring players, but months after launch, GinoMachino (as spotted by Gamerant) managed to beat them with their bare fists.
Described as a grueling "5.5 hour fight," they do wield a shield to parry (and use abilities), but damage is being done by way of raw punches. The fortitude required to pull off a run like this is frankly insane, as they rarely lose their cool during the run. If you want to check out the whole process, GinoMachino has a Twitch channel, and has titled the run "100 Punch Man."
The Godskin Duo are a tricky boss encounter, especially going in completely blind. While there are zones you can use in the arena to your advantage, and plenty of tricks/builds you can adapt to, the sheer chaos of the fight is tough to navigate your first time through. The gist is that both enemies are coming at you
Initially, I assumed that if you defeated both of them at the same time, the encounter would end. In my first blind pre-release review playthrough, I attempted to methodically bring both of them down to roughly 10% health, then defeat both of them simultaneously. Imagine my surprise when they both revived! Oops! Once I refocused and started to figure out when to take them down (and when their second phase was advantageous to trigger), everything clicked. But to be clear, I used weapons, not fists!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bayonetta 3’s story has been one of its most speculated elements, and a new trailer shows off over four minutes of cutscenes and fresh gameplay. The multiverse takes center stage this time around, and we finally get real looks at the alternative versions of Bayonetta and what they bring to the table.
In addition to Bayonetta and Viola, we see what appear to be three Bayonetta variants. One has a youthful, almost teenage popstar look with strawberry-blonde hair and a hip-hop-esque fashion sense. Another version is clad in almost samurai-like armor. No matter the Bayonetta, the action unleashed by them looks as bonkers as you’d expect. For Jeanne fans, stay tuned until the end of the video, where we get a surprising look at a gameplay segment starring Bayo's BFF.


Bayonetta 3 is Game Informer’s cover story this month, and you can catch up on our exclusive features and videos at our cover hub by clicking the banner below. The game launches on October 28 for Switch.]]></summary>

If you've ever wanted to experience cyberpsychosis inside the world of Cyberpunk 2077, now there's a mod for that. A new Cyberpunk 2077 mod adds a new meter that can, potentially, lead to V going cyberpsycho.
A mod developed by NexusMods user djkovrik called "Wannabe Edgerunner" adds a Humanity stat, much like one in the original tabletop Cyberpunk. This stat changes depending on things like installed cyberware, Berserk mode and Sandevistan usage, and kills.

At different thresholds, V will start to experience different effects. Glitches, at first. But then visual glitches, a critical chance debuff, and finally cyberpsychosis. While this gives the player a nice set of buffs, it also insta-spawns the police if you're in public.
To balance it out, this mod…]]></summary>

Sony has released a brand new update for its top-of-the-line gaming platform PlayStation 5 — The PS5 22.02-06.02.00 update adds a number of under-the-hood performance fixes and brings new sorting and categorizing options for the strangely compelling dashboard culture that is "Trophies".
When you now click the Trophy icon on the PS5 dashboard, you can access a full list of all "still to do" achievements, so you can plan your next grinding session in style. Additionally, players can now pin specific challenges to the top of the list, or even snap the list to the screen, thus ensuring that the "Collect 100 hidden items" challenge that has been keeping you awake all night is now hanging overhead like impending danger — constantly prodding you with your abject failure.
Activity Cards have also been tweaked in the new update, and will now be sorted into generic categories such as by game, single-and-multiplayer activities, and online/offline activities. Again, this very minor tweaking of the system hopes to help players more clearly see what tasks need — that's NEED — performing, ensuring that you never leave your couch and ultimately surrender to the television.
PS5 software update version 22.02-06.00.01 is now live on the PS5 platform.

Beyond that, I know that it's a strategy RPG, and I know that it's out on PC as of today.

While there are a number of games dropping on the Nintendo eShop this week, one of the bigger releases is easily Xenoblade Chronicles 3 Expansion Pass DLC Vol. 2. Teased recently via a Nintendo Direct, the DLC includes the fully playable Ino hero, as well as a challenge mode that lets you "collect crystals and exchange them for valuable accessories and new outfits."
As for what's next for the Xenoblade Chronicles 3 expansion pass, we have a longer wait until April 30, 2023, when wave 3 arrives. It'll also include a challenge battle mode, as well as a new playable character, and more outfits. Then the golden goose arrives in December of 2023, when the "new original story scenario" (which is hopefully expansion-level quality) drops. Depending on how they handle it, it could be a big franchise moment.

Set one year after the events of Marvel’s Spider-Man, the story follows Miles as he battles the Roxxon corporation and the mysterious Tinkerer. A new trailer shows off the game’s PC features, which are comparable to the first Spider-Man game. Improvements include ray-traced reflections/shadows, unlocked framerate, ultra-widescreen support, Nvidia DLSS 3/DLAA support, Nvidia Reflex, and DualSense controller support. Check it out below.


Here are the PC specifications as well (click the image to enlarge). 
We scored Miles Morales a 9 out of 10 when it was released in November 2020. Former editor Andrew Reiner wrote in his review that: 
"For a second act, Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales satisfies. Taking to the web-line and soaring across a wintery New York skyline is every bit as enthralling as it was before, and Miles develops into a fantastic hero. This follow-up doesn’t have as much of a sinister punch, but it delivers some great plot twists and concludes with another eye-opening post-credits sequence that teases an exciting future for Insomniac’s Spider-Man series."]]></summary>

Another Marvel's Spider-Man has locked in a date for a PC port. Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales hits PC on November 18.
The PC version of Miles Morales will have PC features and settings, similar to the Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered port that hit PC earlier this year.
These include some fancy graphics options, like ray-traced reflections and new ray-traced shadows. NVIDIA DLSS 3 is also being supported, as are other options like DLSS 2, DLAA, and NVIDIA Reflex. And hardware-wise, Miles Morales will support ultra-wide gaming with ratios of 21:9, 32:9, or even 48:9 through triple-monitor setups.
That's on the extreme end of things though. According to today's PlayStation Blog, Insomniac is also supporting other configurations aside from high-end PCs; namely, portable PC gaming devices. DualSense haptics will also be supported, if you wire one in over a USB connection.

A shocking spin of the web
If you don't own Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered, then no worries. This is a standalone entry. It's going for $49.99 on Steam and Epic, and pre-orders will net a few in-game goodies a little earlier than you'd normally achieve them.
Miles' Spidey adventure is one I never got around to finishing on PlayStation 5, so the prospect of revisiting it is pretty appealing. It's received some high praise, and I like the idea of a short, cinematic Spider-Man game to zip through.
Nice to hear that portable PC devices are a consideration too, for those who have been picking up a Steam Deck now that they're extremely available. The Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered PC port wound up being pretty good, and I'd hope the same holds true for Miles Morales' hop over to computers.
Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales arrives on PC on November 18, 2022.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We celebrate all three of us being back on the Electronic Wireless Show podcast, but two thirds of us being be-plagued, by talking about rejuvinating the Earth - truly, the podcast host of us all. Inspired by new eco-friendly farming game Coral Island, which I've been playing this week, we talk about our favourite games that roll with an ecological protection theme. This is hard for Matthew, because he hates the environment (unless his immediate environment contains a can of Rio).
Matthew comes through with an excellent Cavern Of Lies about trees and tree monsters in games, where he attempts to pull the illusive Double Beckford on us. Does he succeed? Listen to find out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Detective games are often about filling in the blanks. A terrible crime will sit at the heart of them, yes, but most take place in the days and weeks that follow, where the bulk of your time is spent gathering clues and building a case to work out whodunnit. Rarely do you get to glimpse the immediate aftermath of the crime itself, where all the major suspects are still in play and their pockets are stuffed with incriminating evidence they'll no doubt be disposing of in the coming minutes. 
The prime exception to this rule is Lucas Pope's Return Of The Obra Dinn, which gives you a time-travelling pocket watch to revisit the scenes of its many, many murders and work out exactly what happened to its 60-strong passenger list on its titular, ill-fated ship. Frogwares' Sherlock Holmes games and their mind palace visualisation techniques also warrant a mention here, and maybe even Outer Wilds at a push, if you count its 22-minute timeloop as an investigation scene several millennia in the making. But it's Obra Dinn that Color Gray Games emulate most strongly with their impressive debut in The Case Of The Golden Idol, which gives you a series of 12 murders to solve, each of which is presented as a freeze-frame vignette at the moment of death. You're still filling in blanks here, slotting names, objects and eventually verbs in its various scene scrolls to deduce whodunnit and howtheydunit, but this intriguing tale of 18th century high (and a secret) society, betrayals, backstabbing and murder most foul is a mystery game for the ages.

That’s why the game’s Steam version will have its own tutorial. Co-creator Zach Adams has roped in a novice playtester to try the tutorial out, in the form of his wife Annie. Annie bounced off the original, not-so-visually-appealing version of Dwarf Fortress. Yet, says Adams, the tutorial seems to be working to help Annie ease into the game at last.

The way she wanted to organise keys wasn't what the game thought was the right way, and her article examined this frustration; she described the canonical correct solution as being that of a "domestic Joker".
The developers at Max Inferno Studios read this article and decided that, you know what? Alice0 was on to something. They contacted us to let us know that her piece was the inspiration for adding a feature called Let It Be, a skip puzzle function that you can access at any time. Anne Macmillan, who's a co-founder of Max Inferno Studios as well as artist and animator for A Little To The Left, was kind enough to talk to me about it.

I firmly believe that Dead Rising is an all-time great, but also understand why folks have (reasonably) cooled on the game’s particular quirks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, yes, it’s me, once again banging on about the WD Blue SN570. I just think it’s neat: a highly affordable yet remarkably quick M.2 SSD, with multiple capacities to choose from and regular sales making it even cheaper. Speaking of, today is the last day of the Amazon Prime Early Access Sale, which has the 1TB Blue SN570 down to £65.
That’s not quite its lowest price ever, but it does match its flash sale pricing during Prime Day back in July. And is an utter pittance for a 1TB NVMe SSD, let alone one that’s actually quite speedy. Amazon UK also have the 2TB version on sale for £128, just £1 more than its lowest dip on record (Prime Day 2022 again, as it happens). These prices are only available to Prime members, but the Blue SN570 ranks highly among the best SSDs for gaming, so they're well deserving of your cash if you’re in need of PC storage improvements.

Each and every week the game pile grows higher, forming the walls of a virtually impenetrable digital structure known only as the ‘backlog’.

On that light note, it’s nice to see that SteamDB now has a section showing what games are coming out on Steam every week.

Below Deck: Mediterranean had me covered last winter (alongside its Sailing Yacht spin-off), as I watched super yacht crew toil to meet the demands of the wealthy and unhinged. Then Love Island stepped up to fill a large portion of my summer with curated chaos. One guy confessed "I licked her tit or whatever," in a shock revelation to his betrothed.
What's on the reality TV menu for winter? Ainori Love Wagon: Asian Journey, baby. It's on Netflix and I'm convinced it shares great parallels with some of my favourite RPGs of all time.

        <updated>2022-10-12T14:28:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Final Fantasy VII The First Soldier, the mobile multiplayer battle royale, is being shut down in January. The news comes a month shy of the game's one-year anniversary, having launched for iOS and Android in November 2021. 
Square Enix states that it feels it hasn’t delivered the experience it aimed for, so it will begin winding down service starting today. A roadmap on the game’s website lists a three-step sunsetting schedule. Today, you can no longer purchase Shinra credits from the shop, but you can still spend the credits you own until the game shuts down. On November 1, support for non-English localization ends (meaning text will only be displayed in English going forward). Finally, on January 11, The First Soldier goes offline for good.
Here's the full End of Service announcement via Twitter:
The First Soldier was revealed in February 2021 alongside another mobile FFVII RPG, Ever Crisis (which has yet to release but has a closed beta planned for this year). The third-person battle royale took place before the events of FFVII and pit 75 players against each other as SOLDIER candidates. In addition to using firearms, players wield magic and even summons. Square previously stated The First Soldier was an attempt to attract a wider fanbase to the FFVII universe while giving existing fans a new way to enjoy its mythos. 
Unfortunately, this isn't the first Square Enix published multiplayer game to get the axe this year. Babylon's Fall, Platinum Games' live-service action RPG, is also being shutdown in February, less than a year after its ill-received launch. 
While The First Soldier is going away, plenty of FFVII content is in the pipeline. As previously mentioned, Ever Crisis remains on the docket, and Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII Reunion releases on December 13. Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, the follow-up to Remake, is scheduled to launch next winter.]]></summary>

It’s gross. But. You know. It’s also kind of great.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Pokémon Company and Nintendo have released a new Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet trailer all about Iono, the electric-type gym leader of Levincia and the most popular streamer in the Paldean region. 
If you're expecting a look at Pokémon Scarlet and Violet gameplay or the reveal of some new Pokémon or gameplay mechanics, temper your expectations because this video is all about Iono. Check out the gym leader Iono trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, there's a lot going on in this new video. Iono is very much a Paldean influencer, which is a fun addition to the universe of Pokémon, but she's also a gym leader that we'll be facing off against in the game. As for her type, it's Electric, and while not confirmed, it seems the video is hinting toward a gym challenge for her. Before actually battling her, we might have to successfully complete her "who's that Pokémon?" test.
In this instance, she describes her very own Pokémon pal, but we don't get the answer. Perhaps we're meant to know what it is based on her description or maybe she's describing a Pokémon we haven't yet met. Only time will tell. Fortunately, we don't have to wait too much longer to meet this "Supercharged Streamer" because Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet hit Switch on November 18. 
In the meantime, check out this 14-minute Pokémon Scarlet and Violet gameplay trailer from last week, and then watch this video all about Wiglett, a new Diglett-like Pokémon. Check out this trailer all about competitive play after that, and then read our Pokémon Scarlet and Violet preview for more details about Paldea, Terastallizing, and more. 
Do you have an idea of which Pokémon Iono is describing in today's trailer? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

        <updated>2022-10-12T13:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Witchfire has been one of the most promising-looking shooters since its reveal in 2017. The dark fantasy romp was slated to launch in early access later this year, but a shift in design has forced developer The Astronauts to push that launch into next year.
The Astronauts has decided to rework Witchfire’s arena-style combat into an open-world format. Creative director Adrian Chmielarz writes in a blog post that the change makes Witchfire a “better” game. 
“The feature is now 95% implemented. It makes the game better. It is kind of hard for me to imagine the player did not have that freedom before. Sure, you can still be trapped by the witch in this or that spot, and some doors will be closed until you find a key, and it might be too dangerous to enter areas closer to the boss before you are ready– but the world is wide open for you to explore in almost any order, and you can both push forward and retreat as you please.”
Chmielarz also teases more Witchfire news to emerge in the next week or so. It won’t be gameplay footage but rather content promoting the game’s art and world in some fashion. 
Witchfire blends gunplay with the supernatural as players wield guns and magic to fend off otherworldly threats. The game is set in an alternate reality where you’re tasked with hunting down a witch at the behest of the church. The Astronauts previously developed The Vanishing of Ethan Carter, and the studio is made up of ex-People Can Fly employees. 
Witchfire is still slated to launch on PC via The Epic Game Store in early 2023. You can watch the most recent trailer from this year’s Summer Game Fest here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Saints Row reboot sees its first major update next month, but don’t expect any new stuff in Santo Ileso to play around with. Devs Volition insist this one’s just concentrating on hunting down and squashing the game’s many bugs. As we noted when it was released in August, Saints Row has rather a few technical issues. While Volition say this means they’re not at the stage where they can be “talking about roadmaps and expansions”, they are at least releasing a free cosmetic pack this week that includes some boots that look like bananas.

Inspired by series like Final Fight, Kung-Fu Master, and Karate Champ, the fighting genre emerged in arcades, buoyed by a few significant players in the space. One of those franchises was Mortal Kombat, a bloody, gory fighting game that took concepts from other fighting games and dialed them to 11. The series became notorious for its spine-ripping, heart-grabbing, limb-chopping action, but beneath the controversies and the hearings was a technically sound, capable fighting game. 
The Mortal Kombat franchise has continued to grow and evolve, showcasing massive staying power in a sometimes ruthless industry. Now, 30 years into the series' existence, Mortal Kombat has proven it's here to stay as one of the preemin…]]></summary>

This punk rock-inspired warrior hails from another universe and is an Umbra Witch in training. She doesn’t have the same handle on her abilities as Bayonetta (nor her confident elegance), so Viola sports a vastly different playstyle that reflects her inexperience. 


Instead of being adept at using a variety of weapons like Bayonetta, Viola only uses her katana and throwing darts. She also summons her demonic companion Cheshire for backup. What she lacks in finesse, though, she makes up for with raw power.
Playing as Viola, her style feels noticeably more deliberate. She’s still quick, but her sword attacks feel more measured and, most of all, impactful. This approach tells me t…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I picked up the Romancelvania demo at Steam Next Fest on Alice Bee's recommendation, and she was quite correct when she described it as "extremely relevant to [my] interests". So relevant, in fact, that I'm starting to wonder if this wasn't an attempt at psychological sabotage disguised as a friendly gesture. (You wouldn't do that to me, would you, Alice?)
Romancelvania is exactly what it sounds like: dating sim meets Castlevania. No idea how I missed it during my own perusal of the demo list, because unsurprisingly it's immediately become my favourite thing I've ever played at a Steam Next Fest. I was so drawn in, in fact, that I've been having a tough time putting it down, even when I really need to — hence my suspicion that this was some sort of test on Alice's part. No idea if I've succeeded or failed.
The demo starts on a promising note, awakening you in the persona of a comically brooding and exaggeratedly shirtless hunky Dracula. (The final game will include the option to play as a Lady Drac, if you prefer, who will not be shirtless, but not by a large margin.)

Before we jump on what’s new, the core of Bayonetta 3’s combat remains the same, so veterans will find it easy to slip back into the fun dance of chaining combos, peppering foes with gunfire, unleashing torture attacks, and split-second dodging to trigger the time-slowing Witch Time effect. However, one of Bayonetta’s new tricks is Demon Masquerade. Weapons are now imbued with the power of Bayonetta’s many Infernal Demons.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Coral Island  self-describes as a "reimagining of farming games", but if we're being real it doesn't reimagine the Stardew Valley template totally differently. The titular island, and your overgrown plot of farmland on it, has almost the same layout as Stardew Valley, and the tasks you do - growing stuff, keeping animals, making friends with locals, exploring a mine five levels at a time, and appeasing local spirits by giving them bundles of different crops - will also be very familiar to any DewHeads (that's what we call ourselves).
That's not to say Coral Island isn't good. It's all in very beautiful bouncy 3D, for one thing, and I found the island setting (which impacts the flora, fauna, and architecture in general) made everything feel less like work. Combined with a thread of environmentalism weaving through the game, and the fact that Coral Island is slightly easier than Stardew Valley, and you feel like you're doing more progress in less time. If you loved the vibe of ConcernedApe's smash hit, but found the need to hand-write your own almanac a bit intimidating, this is the game for you.

Kinoshita also went into some detail about Additional Orders’ other characters, including punch-maestro Chris Redfield.

Time to get cooking!@monsterhunter DLC is coming to Sonic Frontiers November 14th, at 5pm PST - for free! pic.twitter.com/4OV4Z4LbPB

According to Sega’s Japanese website, the bundle features the Rioreus equipment to outfit Sonic. You’ll also get a grilled meat set, which not only lets you cook up tasty meat but also play mini-games to raise Sonic’s strength. It's a small bundle but a neat way to return the favor after Capcom introduced Sonic-themed content in Monster Hunter Rise last year. Check out Sonic in his armored glory in the photo gallery below.

The Monster Hunter pack will be available to download on November 14, almost a week after Frontiers launches on November 8. For more Sonic Frontiers, check out the latest trailer featuring the reveal of Super Sonic.]]></summary>

In case you missed the mega-guide that went up earlier, today marks the start of Amazon’s Prime Early Access Sale: a two-day buffet of discounts that’s exclusive to Prime members.

The SanDisk Ultra, one of the best microSD cards for the Steam Deck, is on sale across a choice of capacities – with the 1TB model getting especially juicy >50% savings in both the UK and US.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Remember when Overwatch 2 launched last week and people were struggling to register their pre-paid, or pay-as-you-go, numbers so they could play the game? Well, now Activision Blizzard are planning to insist people sign up for two-factor authentication to play the upcoming Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, too. They’re also warning that players with pre-paid plans might not be able to get the process to work.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It looks like Crash Bandicoot 4: It’s About Time is heading to Steam, with Activision Blizzard announcing the news in an unorthodox fashion. The publisher also appears to be teasing the reveal of a new Crash game 
The publisher sent a special Crash-themed pizza box (from "Aku Aku's Steam-In Pizza Shack") to influencers, such as YouTuber Candian Guy Eh. His unboxing video shows that the box is taped with a not-so-subtle message that Crash 4 heads to Steam on October 18. The game, which launched in 2020, is currently playable on PC only through Battle.net. 
Additionally, the box was also taped with a message that read, “Hungry for more? Try our new Wumpa Pizza for $12.08!” Given that The Game Awards is set to air on December 8, it appears highly likely we’ll find out the nature of this title (rumored to be a party game called Wumpa League) during the annual show.
Are you excited to play Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time on Steam? What do you think the rumored new game will be? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

I was lucky enough to go hands-on with an early build of the Wild Hearts's opening hours to see how it stacks up against its age-old competitor, and whether it has any chance of melting down Monster Hunter's trophy cabinet and forging itself a golden crown.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With Persona 5 Royale set to launch on PlayStation 5, Xbox, and Switch on October 21, Atlus has announced the multiplatforms release dates for Persona 3 Portable and Persona 4 Golden. Thankfully, fans only have to wait a few months before all three acclaimed RPG’s become available on modern platforms. 
On January 19, Persona 3 Portable arrives on PlayStation 4, Xbox consoles, Switch, and PC via Steam. That same day, Persona 4 Golden will hit PlayStation 4, Xbox platforms (including Windows), and Switch. Both titles will also be available on Xbox Game Pass at launch.
Persona 3 Portable is the enhanced PSP port of 2007’s Persona 3 (which originally released on PlayStation 2). It launched in 2010 and has never been ported beyond Sony’s handheld. Similarly, Persona 4 Golden is a PS Vita title and the definitive version of its entry, Persona 4. Golden launched in 2012 and has only migrated to Steam, but that didn’t happen until 2020. 
To learn more about each game, check out our reviews for Persona 3 Portable here and Persona 4 Golden here.]]></summary>

Someone at Valve is evidently aware of this, given the recent Steam Deck video - which we wrote about two days ago - contained a shot of a Steam library with a Nintendo Switch emulator in it.

Oops. Valve have since deleted and re-uploaded the video with the emulator removed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's easy to take backwards compatibility for granted on PC, so much so that we rarely even use the phrase "backwards compatibility". Most old games will simply run, and for everything else there's usually a compatibility mode built into Windows or DOSBox to get it going.

This didn't happen by accident, as an old blog post by a former Microsoft programmer explains. When Microsoft wanted users to switch to Windows 95, for example, they went so far as to add specific code that looked for SimCity and, if it was running, changed how memory allocation worked so that the game wouldn't crash.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Graphics cards are getting bigger, hotter and more expensive - and that first one is more of a problem than you might think. With the RTX 4090 and a whole family of oversized GPUs on the way, those tiny PCIe slots on your motherboard are taking on an incredible amount of weight, such that even mid-range cards can sag and bend over time. 
The best way to prevent this is with a brace, which pushes up from the bottom of your case to the far end of the graphics card, holding it level and preventing all that force from affecting the card or the PCIe slot. You sometimes get a support brace like this free with your graphics card, but otherwise you can pick one up fairly inexpensively from a range of manufacturers.

You can tune in on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central to join in on the fun, or catch the archive when it hits on our Game Informer Shows YouTube channel. 
Released in October 2014 as a Wii U exclusive, Bayonetta 2 is a sequel that almost didn't happen. Despite a strong critical reception to the first game, sales didn't meet expectations, leading to publisher Sega passing on a follow-up. Thankfully, Nintendo swooped in to fund and publish Bayonetta 2, locking it in as a third-party exclusive. Bayonetta 2 features improved combat, new features, an even nuttier plot, and a near-bottomless well of action. Join me, Marcus Stewart, as I dig into my personal GOTY for 2014 and chat all about our Bayonetta 3 cover.

The action platformer came out on PlayStation late last week, but it's not coming to Steam until November 11th. So far, reviews have been quite middling, which isn't wholly surprising in some sense, but having played the public demo the other week, I'm not ashamed to say that I had a pretty all right time with it! Based on two hours of play time, I'd say it's very much in the same kind of vein as your Bayonettas and Nier: Automatas, and I'm 100% down for that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It feels odd saying "Overwatch 1", but Overwatch 1 occupies an important place in my personal and professional life. And all things considered, I do not miss it in the slightest. I spent so much time straining against the game's tug-of-war matches that I simply grew tired of trying really hard at it - or perhaps more accurately, trying not to launch my head through the nearest plaster wall.
Clearly, there was a time where I adored Overwatch, though. A time when I'd grind solo-queue most evenings until 3am, in a bid to climb the ranks ever higher. To what end? My own personal satisfaction, I suppose. I'd eventually hit Master (let me brag just once, okay) and then a few months later, I applied for a job at Gamer Network writing guides about Overwatch's intricacies. I moved to Brighton for my first proper job. Now, with Overwatch 2's release, it all feels like it's come full circle.

I might even come to love it, considering it's already so enjoyable even with a few years of early access left (a fact I forgot until I reached a "work in progress" marker several hours in).
You climb a tower and splat monsters and culty magic nerds. You loot, and avoid traps, chug red liquids, and occasionally die and have to start again. But I enjoyed every moment, and never once hit the usual aggravating points that push me out of the genre. It's good stuff all round, frankly.

Weird RPG does have some fun ideas but sadly, it's too mundane an ARPG to be truly weird—or good. Still, I was delighted when I found a helmet whose stats get better the worse your graphics card is.

Curious, he decided to pursue more knowledge, and landed in the Nier modding Discord server. 


Like him, many other Nier: Automata players who caught wind of the phenomenon sat upright - metaphorically and perhaps literally - and flocked to both Reddit and Discord to check out what exactly was up with the secret area. It was dubbed the "church mystery" or "sadfutago's posts", among other monikers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mortal Kombat was released three decades ago, in October of 1992, and its gory style of fighting has persisted through the years, through controversies, movies, and more. 
The NetherRealm-developed series celebrates its 30th anniversary this month, and the studio has released a new trailer to highlight the legacy of the franchise and bathe players in nostalgia and hype. If you're looking for a special Mortal Kombat announcement, though, keep your expectations in check. Maybe something like that comes at a later date this month – who knows? – but today's trailer is all about Mortal Kombat's 30-year history in video games and other entertainment mediums. 
Check out the Mortal Kombat 30th Anniversary trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, the video above doesn't announce any new movies or games, or even DLC for Mortal Kombat 11, but that's okay because it's still a great watch nonetheless, especially for longtime fans. 
Here are some fun Mortal Kombat 30th Anniversary logos as well: 

For more, read Game Informer's Mortal Kombat 11 review and then read about how NetherRealm is done making Mortal Kombat 11 content as it moves into development of its next game. Check out this interview with Mortal Kombat creator Ed Boon on his career in video games and more after that.

The most recent trailer for The Invincible arrived during this year's E3 madness, and featured astrobiologist Yasna having a suspenseful encounter with a big spider bot and its anti-matter death ray. It was only a five-minute long clip at the time, but I've now played an expanded version of that particular scene, and yep, I still don't much like the look of that there laser bot.

        <updated>2022-10-07T13:41:45.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[More than six years after its original release, No Man's Sky is finally out on Switch today alongside the new Waypoint update, which brings the game up to a new 4.0 version. This update is live on PlayStation and Xbox consoles, Switch, and PC as of today. 
As for what to expect, Waypoint is best described as a major overhaul to No Man's Sky geared toward making the game easily tailored to players, regardless of the experience they're trying to get out of it. If you want something more relaxing and casual, you can do that. If you want a more challenging experience, the Waypoint update lets you do that too. 
"Access the universe of No Man's Sky from anywhere in update 4.0 Waypoint, launching for the first time on Nintendo Switch, and overhauling fundamental elements of gameplay including game modes, inventory size, and usability, milestones, journey cataloging, and much more," the No Man's Sky Waypoint blog post reads. "Tailor every aspect of the game to your unique playstyle with custom game modes. Launch into the action quickly with an existing difficulty preset, or tinker with everything from economy to combat challenge to survival difficulty to perfect your experience." 
Alongside today's Switch release and Waypoint update, Hello Games has released a new trailer giving a tease of what to expect in the 4.0 version of the game: 


As you can see, Waypoint is bringing a lot of changes to No Man's Sky. Alongside game mode customization, there are also new seamless auto-saves, the launch of trade rockets, a new inventory overhaul with streamlined item management, unique Switch rewards, and so much more. Be sure to read the entire Waypoint blog post for all the details.

More specifically, it begins November 11 at 4 p.m. PT/7 p.m. ET. This is perfect timing because it's a three-way battle between Grass-type Pokémon, Fire-type Pokémon, and Water-type Pokémon, the types of the three starters we'll be choosing from in Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet on November 18. Check out the announcement tweet for yourself below: 
Grass-type. Fire-type. Water-type. This debate has perplexed our great philosophers for ages. Let’s settle it.
#Splatfest collaboration begins 11/11 at 4pm PT!

October 7, 2022
The event will begin on November 11 and it will run through 4 p.m. PT/7 p.m. ET on November 13. While nothing is confirmed just yet, the image released alongside today's news seems to tease some Pokémon-inspired gear. Hopefully, we all get to show off our favorite of the three types in our gear and weapons of choice. It's also worth noting that Nintendo calls this Splatfast a "special...collaboration" so there might be even more  Pokémon integration than we expect. Only time will tell. 
In the meantime, read Game Informer's Splatoon 3 review and then watch this 14-minute Pokémon Scarlet and Violet trailer released yesterday.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The new guards of Batman's city rise up in the launch trailer for Gotham Knights released by WB Games Montréal today. 
With just two weeks to go until the October 21 release date, marketing for Gotham Knights has begun to ramp up. We recently went hands-on with the game, and you can read our impressions and key takeaways about how it plays now, and recent videos have shared some of the behind-the-scenes inspirations for the game's narrative design. But now, as the official release date draws nearer, WB Games Montréal is bringing the hype. 
Check out the Gotham Knights launch trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, Gotham Knights' story of the Court of Owls and how they interact with both the Gotham Knights – Batgirl, Nightwing, Robin, and Red Hood – as well as other Gotham villain mainstays like Penguin, Mr. Freeze, Clayface, and Harley Quinn is shaping up to be something exciting for the Bat-verse of games. Fortunately, we don't have to wait too much longer now to experience it for ourselves because Gotham Knights hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on October 21. 
Which of the Gotham Knights will you be maining? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

This news comes after weeks of Kojima teasing a face with the words, "Who Am I?" in bold white letters. The face was obscured due to some neat shadow tricks, but right from the jump, fans tried determining whose face it might be, and it didn't take long for Fanning to become the frontrunner. Continual teasing led us to yesterday, when Kojima finally released the images below, confirming Fanning as the face in question.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Bayonetta 3's first gameplay trailer hit last year, her new braided hairstyle caught the attention of fans for its resemblance to the look of Cereza, the little girl who tagged along with players in the first game. Spoiler for Bayonetta 1: Cereza is the child version of Bayonetta, so perhaps our hero simply wanted to return to her adolescent roots. However, the third game's focus on the multiverse has prompted some fans to consider a more tantalizing theory. 
First, to provide some context, here's a (relatively) quick refresher of Bayonetta's backstory for newcomers or lapsed fans. Five hundred years prior to the events of the first game, Bayonetta, whose real name is Cereza, was born the child of an Umbra Witch and a Lumen Sage. Since the light-worshipping Sages were rivals to the da…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo has released the first trailer for its upcoming Super Mario Bros. movie and it features plenty of the famed plumber as well as Toad, Luigi, Bowser, the Mushroom Kingdom, and more. It also features our first listen to Chris Pratt's Mario.
Pratt teased back in June that his Mario voice is "unlike anything you've heard in the Mario world," and it turns out he's right in that we've never heard Pratt's voice in the world of Mario, which is to say his Mario just sounds like him. Elsewhere in the trailer, which aired during a special Nintendo Direct all about the film today, we get a glimpse at the movie's villain, Bowser, who is voiced by Jack Black, Toad, voiced by Keegan-Michael Key, and even a quick shot at Luigi at the end. 
Check out the Super Mario Bros. movie trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, Super Mario Bros. looks like you'd expect, in line with Illumination's other animated movies like Despicable Me and Minions. It looks like it will be a great time at the theater, making the wait until its silver screen release on April 7 that much harder.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EA has officially revealed Need For Speed Unbound, the first new Need For Speed game in three years, and it hits new-gen consoles and PC this December. 
After leaking earlier this week, EA has released the official reveal trailer for Need For Speed and as leaks and rumors suggested, it's quite a drastic shift in style for the series. It features the slick realistic visuals fans of the series know quite well but this time, it's mixed with an almost anime-like animation style. It looks great, in my opinion, but it likely won't be for everybody. 
Check out the Need For Speed Unbound reveal trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, Unbound represents a pretty drastic departure for the series in terms of visuals but elsewhere, it looks like Need For Speed. There seems to be plenty of car customization, cops to run from, city streets to speed through, and if the reveal trailer's song by A$AP Rocky is any indication, a great soundtrack.
Only time will tell but fortunately, we don't have to wait too long because Need For Speed Unbound hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on December 2. As you might have noticed, the reveal trailer doesn't mention consoles from the previous generation, like the PlayStation 4 or Xbox One, so you might need a current-gen machine to play the game.

On top of that, some players have found themselves unable to play once logged in due to the game's SMS Protect system, which requires you to give Blizzard a "unique" phone number for authentication purposes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last week, Google announced it plans to shut down Stadia on January 18. One of the less-discussed casualties of the news was that Tequila Works’ Gylt, a horror adventure game and the first Stadia-exclusive title, would disappear entirely. Thankfully, that won’t be the case.
Tequila Works has confirmed that it plans to make Gylt multiplatform in 2023. It doesn’t specify which platforms the game will become available on, but it’s a relief to know that one of Stadia’s few original gems won’t be lost to history. 
🎃 We bring terrific news: GYLT is going multiplatform in 2023! More info to come in the upcoming months.https://t.co/ON1pbiGsB9 pic.twitter.com/2sWdseym2G
October 4, 2022
Gylt launched in November 2019 alongside Stadia. It stars a young girl named Sally who searches for her missing cousin across a town haunted by evil spirits. The narrative also serves a commentary on bullying and depresssion. The game’s vibe and art direction evoke films like Coraline or Tim Burton’s animated works and channels games like Inside and Silent Hill. Gameplay emphasizes stealth, with players using a flashlight to defeat enemies. Despite its more innocent veneer, the game has its share of genuinely creepy moments, and I personally found it to be an enjoyable horror romp.
Will you be checking out Gylt before Stadia shuts down or wait to play it elsewhere next year? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony announced its new gaming loyalty program, PlayStation Stars, back in July, and the service is now live in North and South America. PlayStation users can sign up for the free program, but there’s one big caveat.
PlayStation Stars allows players to earn points and digital collectibles by completing “campaigns,” which range from completing small objectives while playing games to larger monthly challenges. Any PlayStation player can join Stars; you don’t need a Plus subscription. 
Completing campaigns also raises your Star Status, a leveling system consisting of four ranks. Everyone begins at Level 1, but doing things like purchasing games from PSN or earning a certain number of trophy rarities raises this level, increasing the quality of rewards you earn. 
Digital rewards, which Sony confirmed are not NFTs and cannot be resold, include models of old PlayStation consoles and characters from first-party titles. You can also redeem points to use as funds for your digital store wallet and to purchase DLC. Points remain available for 24 months after earning them. 
If you’re running to sign up now, there’s already a waitlist to join PS Stars. Sony states that new users will have to wait about two months after the date they register to be accepted into the program. It's unclear why this is the case, but one could assume Sony doesn't want to be flooded with too many memberships at once as it gradually gets the program off the ground. Registration also doesn't seem consistent yet, as some folks were immediately let in while others have been told to wait (and some others still can't access Stars in parts of the U.S. as of publishing). 
PlayStation Stars will launch in Europe, Australia, and New Zealand next week on October 13. To learn more about the program, including its handy FAQ, you can visit its official site here.]]></summary>

Gotham Knights launches in just a couple of weeks, and Batman fans have been excited – and trepidatious – about the Bat clan’s big family adventure. To find out how the project is shaping up, I took a trip to Warner Bros. Montreal to play two hours of the game. I spent time-fighting crime as all four characters, explored Gotham’s open world, and took down criminals alongside a co-op partner. I also chatted with the dev team to uncover more nuggets about what the adventure brings to the table. Here are some general hands-on impressions and intr…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bandai Namco has released a new trailer for the new-gen release of Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot alongside news that it hits PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S in January. 
More specifically, Kakarot comes to new-gen consoles on January 13, 2023, meaning we're just a few months away from this re-release. To accompany today's news, Bandai Namco has released a new trailer showcasing some of DBZ's most iconic moments alongside some comparison clips between the PlayStation 4/Xbox One version of Kakarot and the upcoming new-gen update. Unsurprisingly, it looks a lot better. 
Check it out for yourself below: 


Kakarot on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S features updated visuals that look even better than the original release and 60 frames-per-second gameplay. If you already own the game, you can upgrade to the new-gen version of Kakarot for free. 
This new trailer also teases what's to come in the game's second season pass. The first DLC is called Bardock: Alone Against Fate, and it's a new story arc. Two more story arc DLCs are in the season pass as well. Plus, Season Pass 2 owners will get a cooking item that increases HP and Ki defense. 
While waiting for January, read Game Informer's Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot review to find out why we think the game is flawed but still highly enthralling.

Similar to Capcom's Monster Hunter series, the central draw of Wild Hearts is the massive creatures and how you successfully hunt them down. You craft new weapons and armor along the way, growing stronger and stronger with each hunt, as you attempt to rid the land of Azuma of these beasts. The reveal trailer released last week gave some quick glimpses of what that looks like, but a new gameplay trailer showcases seven minutes of Wild Hearts gameplay.

Instead, the Umbra Witch is brought to life by veteran performer Jennifer Hale.

On the other hand, its concept as a puzzle game sounded new and unique: use a weapon that turns back time on individual objects aboard a space station to stop the Earth from exploding.

Overwatch took the gaming world by storm when it launched in 2016, thanks to its well-balanced roster of unique heroes and terrific objective-based, first-person-shooting gameplay. The game’s popularity endured through the years thanks to a wealth of new content like characters, maps, cosmetics, and game modes, adding to the terrific foundation. However, once the content dried up for Overwatch, the public interest followed shortly afterward. Overwatch 2 represents the re-emergence of one of…]]></summary>

The two discuss how the game runs and looks on Switch, how the experience holds up five years after its original release, and whether Nier Automata is still worth playing all these years later. 
While Nier Automat has, over the year, hit PlayStation and Xbox consoles, as well as PC, it has yet to reach a Nintendo platform...that is until this Thursday, October 6, when The End of YoRHa Edition is released. As for what to expect, this new edition of Nier Automata includes the following:
Nier Automata base game
All previously released DLC
New costumes exclusive to Switch
If you're wondering whether Switch is the platform to play this on for newcomers, or if you're wondering whether this new release is worth a replay, we have you covered in the latest New Gameplay Today, which you can watch below. Enjoy!

The NES pulled the burgeoning industry out of the “video game crash” and introduced countless iconic characters and franchises. It seemed like every hit property received a game at the time. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Top Gun, DuckTales, Dungeons & Dragons, American Gladiators: the list goes on and on. However, one iconic brand shockingly never made the transition into a NES game.

Up next was The Witcher. CDPR has revealed that its next Witcher game, which was announced earlier this year, is being developed under the codename Polaris. The studio says "it is the beginning of a new saga" and that it aims to release two more Witcher games after Polaris, creating a new AAA RPG Witcher trilogy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EA and Motive Studios have released the first official gameplay trailer for the upcoming remake of Dead Space. 
The studio has been slowly releasing new information and video clips of this remake in its behind-the-scenes showcases focused on things like the game's sound, visuals, or something else. But today's trailer marks the first time we've seen this much official gameplay at once and it looks great. Terrifying, of course, but great. 
Check out the official Dead Space remake gameplay trailer for yourself below: 


And here are some high-resolution screenshots from today's trailer: 

As you can see, this remake is looking awesome and we can't wait to go hands-on with it. Fortunately, we don't have to wait too much longer because it hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on January 27, 2023.]]></summary>
