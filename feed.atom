        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Remember when people were licking the game cartridges from their Nintendo Switches back in 2017? The actual company had to make a post on their support page telling people to not do that. Doing so wasn't harmful, but it still shouldn't be done. Now it seems that we're in a time where people are huffing those fumes coming from Valve's Steam Deck. 


A recent Reddit post went viral where someone asked Valve if it’s safe to inhale the exhaust from the Steam Deck’s vents. The original support claim was made on December 8, with Valve responding on the day of the post. This post was (hopefully) made as a meme just to see what they’d say if anything. 


Valve responded to this post with the following:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Anybody remember when Bethesda said we could expect a PS5 and Xbox Series upgrade of Fallout 4 sometime in the future? It's understandable if you've forgotten. It was kind of brushed to the side, but now the studio has a (sort of) update.


In a recent post on the official Twitter account, Bethesda has thanked fans for their patience in waiting for the Fallout 4 next-gen update. However, the developer says it needs "a bit more time" so don't expect it any day now.




The post then ends by referring to it as an "exciting return to the Commonwealth in 2024," which suggests it's coming next year. However, that still doesn't give a lot of details. That's potentially another twelve months we have to wait.


Frozen in time


With all the buzz around Starfield and the hope of hearing anything – literally anything – about the next Elder Scrolls game, word about the upgrade all but disappeared. How long's it been since Bethesda said it was on its way? Over a year?


While Fallout 4 is not everyone's favorite entry in the series, it would be nice to play a spit shined version of it on PS5 or Xbox Series X|S. The game came out in 2015 and while it doesn't have the staying power of Skyrim, it offered up a decent amount of content. And call me a fool if you must, but I quite liked the base-building aspects.


With the vague message about when the upgrade will actually be happening, some fans may be at least a bit placated to know it's still going ahead.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's been a lot of criticism in the gaming world lately. Yes, I'm talking about The Day Before, but it goes beyond that. In fact, negative feedback from the community seems to have gotten so bad that Starfield's design director has had a few (hundred) words to say about it.


As reported by PC Gamer, Bethesda's own Emil Pagliarulo decided to give an honest opinion about "how disconnected some players are from the realities of game development." The thread – which goes on for 15 posts – offers a defense of studios, saying that "designers, programmers, artists, producers, and everyone else" work hard on their projects.




He does understand where frustrations come from, however. Post two starts by being a little understanding, saying that "when you're a consumer and spend money on things, that gives you the right to complain about those things."


The Starfield designer then says he doesn't complain about games on social media for two reasons:



He knows how difficult and time-consuming it is to make a video game.


The fact that he works for a game studio would make it "uncool and unprofessional" to publicly criticize those who work in the industry.



Without wishing to quote the whole thread, the nuts and bolts of it is that Pagliarulo obviously feels there is too much negativity aimed at video games and the studios that make them. There are causes to have complaints, of course, but at the end of the day, "normal people have come together to work FOR YEARS for one goal - to bring you fun and happiness."




It's hard to say whether he's talking specifically about Starfield or something else. It's likely a mixture of many things. Whether you agree with him or not is up to you, but it's obviously something he's been wanting to get off his chest.

I appreciate that a PC gaming site might not be the most natural home for this information, considering both that these are not technically gaming CPUs and that that Meteor Lake’s most hyped-up feature is more of a productivity aid: a Neural Processing Unit (NPU) for client-side AI work. However, as the new H-series parts also integrate Intel Arc graphics for the first time, there is some interesting potential for them to transform lightweight ultrabooks into viable gaming laptops.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Video game openings have always been a source of fascination for me. As a player, you're excited by the prospect of the game to come - the sights you'll see, the challenges you'll face - and first impressions can make or break your entire perception of what a game is versus the one you had stored in your head before switching it on. For video game creators, however, a new beginning is often racked with questions. What, exactly, do you choose to show players first? How will you introduce them to something they've never seen before? And if that game is successful, how do you keep reinventing that first impression across what could be several decades? 
In revisiting every mainline Doom game to celebrate its 30th anniversary this month, it's clear that even id's iconic shooter has wrestled with how to answer these question, and the ways it's tried to reinvent itself over the years paints a captivating portrait of a series trying to move with the times. Nowhere is this more apparent than in its opening levels. Played in close succession, crushing 30 years into not even quite three hours, what emerges isn't just the evolution of one of the all-time great PC games, but also a potted history of the FPS. So join me as we chart Doom's rise, fall and rebirth through the lens of its first stages.

Earlier today, word got out that A24 and Kojiima Productions were partnering up for a live-action feature film adaptation of Death Stranding. News of this partnership came by way of a new A24 shirt adorned with some strands from Death Stranding; the t-shirt's description revealed A24 and Kojima Productions had entered an official partnership.
At the time, official channels for Kojima Productions and A24 had not said anything regarding this partnership. But now, the official A24 Twitter account has confirmed the partnership. 
"It's official: we've partnered with Kojiima Productions on the live-action feature film adaptation of Hideo Kojima's acclaimed video game, Death Stranding," the tweet reads.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Including a lovely winter level.
Sonic the Hedgehog 2 is well known for its cut content, and while snippets of this have been teased over the years, The Video Game History Foundation has now presented what might be the most comprehensive deep dive into Sonic 2's lost stages (thanks, Time Extension).
According to the video, three designers had contributed content that ultimately wouldn't make it into the Genesis / Mega Drive sequel, including Brenda Cook (formerly Ross), Craig Stitt, and Tom Payne. The reasoning behind the levels getting the chop is that Sonic 2 was originally meant to be far more ambitious than the final product, roping in time travel mechanics that would eventually be seen in Sonic CD.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Confession time, readers. Before a couple of weeks ago, I had never played the original Doom. As a child, my family didn't have much money and I didn't get my first laptop until I was 16. Thus, I missed out on a lot of what are now considered PC staples. With dread, I'm often met with the accursed exclamation, "You've not played insert game before?" followed by a good dose of judgment. But what do you do when you need to play through a backlog of games all while keeping up-to-date with new releases for work? With games now stretching out at 100+ hours apiece, where is the time for old classics like Doom?

Publisher Null Games and indie dev Yeah Us! Games have announced Streetdog BMX, an extreme sports game that aims to pedal its way onto Switch next year.

The Nintendo Switch has smashed all sorts of records in 2023 and it turns out it's just done it again in recent times.
As highlighted by Circana (formerly NPD) industry analyst Mat Piscatella, the hybrid hardware managed to surpass "lifetime US unit sales" of Microsoft's Xbox 360 in November, making it the third best-selling system since NPD began tracking data. No sales figures have been shared.

'Tis the season, so we're wrapping up another year of gaming at Destructoid with 2023's best games, and that includes a heavy-hitting category of PlayStation nominees. 


Destructoid's process is pretty simple, our very own Eric Van Allen explains as much in his Indie Nominees rundown. Games can only be nominated in one category, and our 'year' begins in December 2022 — December 2023 games don't make the cut. 


Anyway, in the spirit of kicking another holiday hornet's nest, here's our nominees for best PS4 / PS5 game of the year.

River City Girls, as a game, I don’t love as much. Its art style and soundtrack, on the other hand, I dig with both hands.


To be honest, I was practically married to the NES/Famicom art style of the series. Whenever it moved away from those rectangular meaty-armed brutes, I always felt like something was lost. However, in recent years, we’ve seen that art style preserved. Some of those games that lean on the old 8-bit art style have even felt a little hollow behind the aesthetic, which is probably why I connected so well with River City Girls.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Insomniac is not quite yet done with adding new content to Marvel's Spider-Man 2. Although the promised accessibility update and New Game Plus mode haven't launched yet, more features are coming.


The developer announced that more features are coming to Marvel's Spider-Man 2 via Twitter. It didn't give a specific month, but does state the next update will drop in early 2024.




The most exciting feature announced is replaying missions, since it'll allow players to replay their favorite moments without starting over. Others, like changing tendril colors, are neat touches that add customization, and changing the time of day is great for setting up the perfect shot in photo mode.


New Game Plus is obviously a big one too, as is the accessibility update which is set to add Audio Descriptions. While the former gives players a reason to jump back in, Audio Descriptions could be a huge help for players who haven't been able to start Marvel's Spider-Man 2 just yet.


These additions are also just what's outlined, as Insomniac states in its post that even more are coming. It's honestly in line with how the studio has treated its previous games, adding new features and options some time after launch.


It is nice seeing these updates be as comprehensive as they are and at no additional cost. Hopefully, this trend of new features coming out for free continues for Insomniac. Marvel's Spider-Man 2 was up for seven awards at this year's Game Awards, but didn't manage to take home any trophies from the night.

The acquisition won't cost a dime, and the content will remain in your library. That said, the Epic Games Store will become the default Destiny 2 destination for those who take up this offer. This is the first of several giveaways from Epic, with 17 reportedly set to arrive over the coming days.


Players have been asking for a more accessible entry point in Destiny 2 for years. While the base game is free to play, Destiny's expansions haven't seen much, if any, price drop since release. Sentiment recently came to a head following a round of layoffs at Bungie and the confirmation of the next expansion's delay.

It would not have been, all things considered, an unusual question to ask one of the game industry’s leading personalities. The Entertainment Software Association’s Electronic Entertainment Expo, better known as E3, has long been a dominating feature of the summer. But in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, the ESA hasn’t been able to open the doors to the highly regarded in-person convention.
However, Keighley is the driving force behind Summer Game Fest, a newly established but increasingly successful showcase effectively competing with E3. The query came from one of the many viewers who tuned in to see him speak candidly on YouTube following the Xbox/Bethesda showcase, one of Summer Game Fest’s crowning jewels.

I was fine to wait for a sequel years down the road, perhaps with Kratos and Atreus traversing through a new line of mythological lands and gods. But I wanted some reason to return to its beautiful world, adrenaline-inducing combat, and top-tier characters.

I'm being slightly cheeky here, of course, but the simple fact remains that Bungie has burned through surprisingly massive amounts of community goodwill ever since Destiny 2: Lightfall came out. After moving from one precarious situation into another, it was a bit of a surprise to see the studio embrace certain features and changes that, realistically, should've been in Destiny 2 from the get-go.

For example, more than 40 percent of players customized their analog stick deadzone input in last year's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II. More than half of all players in that game adjusted graphical accessibility settings, too, like motion blur, field of view, and camera movement. 
For this year's entry, Sledgehammer says, "Modern Warfare III provides even more ways to customize the visual exp…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following uncomfortable close to the Xbox and PlayStation Year in Review roundups, Nintendo has provided its own.


Like most other year-in-review wrap-ups, Nintendo shows you the number of hours played on your Switch (Switches, if you’re fancy), what games you prefer, and further breakdowns beyond that. Unlike the PlayStation round-up, it doesn’t try to tell you your horoscope; instead, it just gives you the facts. I’m going to take a guess here, but it’s statistically likely that your top-played game this year was The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. Mine is, and I didn’t even finish it.


Here are some more Year in Review facts about me, which you can totally skip if you don’t care. I put in 295 hours across 58 games. I mostly play on PC and retro consoles these days. Aside from The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, my top played games are Pikmin 4 (which I still haven’t finished post-game on) and Fatal Frame: Mask of the Lunar Eclipse. Hey! I really like those games.

There are some good memories here. I can’t believe I only played 6 hours of Metal Slug. That’s more than the 2 hours I put into Super Mario Wonder. I can totally believe I put 14 hours into Paranormasight. Did you know I played through the entirety of Metroid Prime Remastered in 14 hours before I reviewed it? What I really learned here is that I spent quite a few months of this year feeling depressed and burnt out between deep dives of review games. What a year!


You can stare into your soul, if you want, by just going to this page here and checking your Year in Review. You can even tell Nintendo what your favorite game this year was. Don’t disappoint them!

Nemůžete se rozhodnout, na čem budete mezi vánočními svátky pracovat? Pojďte se pobavit na Virtuální Bastlírnu - online setkání bastlířů, elektrotechniků a obecně nadšenců do techniky, pořádaném bastlířskou dílnou MacGyver. Pro rozproudění konverzace si strahovští bastlíři přichystali několik zajímavých témat a novinek. Ukáží proto novou verzi SDK pro Picopad kompatibilní s oficiálním Pico SDK, nový pěkný hotplate s nastavitelným profilem pájení nebo ST-Link kombinovaný s power profilerem od Nordicu. Pokud máte rádi měřící techniku, žasnete nad zbrusu novou a velice zajímavou napěťovou referenci (tak novou, že ještě není na trhu). 

Ze světa HW strahováci zmíní, jak vypadá zevnitř střela Javelin nebo vojenský dron Baba Yaga. Zapomenout ale nemůžou ani na ukázky toho, jaké různé hacky nové Hackaday Badge už vznikly. Dozvíte se, kde sehnat napěťové a odporové reference pro kalibrace multimetrů. Nebo třeba jak poznat měřením rozdíl mezi berylliovou keramikou a běžnou nebo jak připojovat mikrosondy přímo na křemík integrovaných obvodů.

A aby byla legrace, zmíní i nějaké bizarnosti jako USB-C zdroj na DIN lištu, novou verzi ReactOS chodící na UEFI (někdy), simulátor černobylského reaktoru nebo ATX zdroj plněný kovovými pilinami.

Příští Virtuální Bastlírna se pod taktovkou projektu MacGyver studentského klubu SiliconHill bude konat ve čtvrtek 14. prosince od 20:00 minimálně do 22:00 (ale obvykle končí o dost později). Odkaz na konferenci se před samotnou akcí objeví na bastlířské wiki.]]></summary>

I've actually not played Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands, so my most recent experience with the series goes back all the way to 2008's Prince of Persia. The switch to a 2.5D format intrigued me as it felt like one of those situations where it could be a big payoff, or potentially the wrong move. After playing The Lost Crown for a few hours, it certainly feels like the right choice.

It's an atmospheric and rewardingly meticulous experience that typically pits you against overwhelming numbers, where victory comes about by carefully exploiting reaction abilities, positioning your troop of weary warriors just-so, and manipulating the initiative bar. At times, for me, it's up there with Into The Breach.
But I do acknowledge that it's an acquired taste, not least because the narrative and extra-dimensional setting are relentlessly unpleasant - a terrible soup of mother metaphors and Penny Dreadful imagery, in which you pit clones against Silent Hill monsters, then liquefy the survivors to spawn new characters. What's the appropriate way to follow up a game like that? Ah yes, with an episodic dating sim.

It's a sci-fi odyssey with third-person shooting that looks and sounds a lot like Mass Effect, but it has one differentiating Big Idea (aside from Matthew McConaughey): time dilation, whereby time passes different in different places, depending on relative velocity and local gravity.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You dropped this, Sargon.
Back in June, we went hands-on with Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, a new 2D Metroidvania take on the long-running dashing and slashing franchise. We were thrilled to learn that Ubisoft Montpellier is the team crafting this new adventure as its past games like Rayman Origins and Rayman Legends were incredibly unique works of art, and The Lost Crown quickly joined the ranks of games we’re most looking forward to in 2024.
While our time with The Lost Crown was smooth, snappy, and seems like a promising title for Metroid fans, we didn’t really consider that this new entry could be straying too far away from what made the Sands of Time trilogy and Jordan Mechner's original games so special. There are plenty of titles vying for the throne shared by Samus and the Belmonts, so will this crown lose its luster over time compared to its contemporaries or can this Prince weather the sandstorm that lies ahead?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in May when I first played Ubisoft's new Metroid-like Prince Of Persia game, The Lost Crown, ahead of its reveal at this year's Summer Game Fest, I got to sample several hours' worth of some of the early areas inside its cursed mountaintop citadel of Mount Qaf. Some of protagonist Sargon's powers had been unlocked early to give us a taste of his abilities, and on the whole, I had an exceedingly good time with it. One thing was missing though, and that was any kind of narrative framing for why Sargon was here in the first place. Sure, we'd been told ahead of time that Sargon's main mission in The Lost Crown is tracking down and saving the eponymous Prince of this game, but I didn't actually see any of this in action. Anything with the slightest whiff of story about it had been expertly excised from that initial demo build, and I was left none the wiser about how those opening hours of The Lost Crown would really play out in the final game.
Now, I've been able to play the game from the beginning, with all the story bits slotted back in and Sargon's powers unlocked in the correct order. You may have got a glimpse of some of that stuff in the new trailer released during last week's Game Awards. In the space of two minutes, it sets the scene for Sargon's rescue mission by first introducing all of his fellow warrior mates, and then seconds later showing how they're all at each other's throats as they get increasingly turned around in Mount Qaf's labyrinth. And oh my, I can practically feel all the inevitable backstabbing from here. It's going to be delicious, I can tell, and I can't wait to slice them all six ways to Sunday when The Lost Crown comes out in January.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lightbulb Crew, the developer behind 2020’s Othercide, have announced their next game, Nova Hearts. A departure from their last game, Nova Hearts is a “turn-based combat dating adventure game.” The first episode, Nova Hearts: The Spark will be out on January 17, 2024.


I know what you’re thinking, but if I understand correctly, the combat and the dating are separate. It’s not like you invite someone to a date on American Gladiators. You don’t pummel the affection out of them.




Instead, a “mysterious cosmic force” gives a number of people in town superpowers, which inevitably leads some to use their powers for good and others for evil. That’s fertile ground for the seeds of love to be planted. In Nova Hearts, you “text, chat, and date” your friends and enemies, with your relationship choices affecting the course of the narrative. Hopefully, this means that I can just seduce everyone and have them fight for my affections.


When you’re not trying to get into the tights of those around you, you also fight against monstrosities from another dimension. This takes place in turn-based battles where you “use your strategic know-how, stylish combos, and the tactical timeline” to win the day.


Crossing anything with a dating sim is a great way to get my attention. Why do I like Mass Effect? Dating. What does Baldur’s Gate 3 have that makes it so engrossing? Dating. It isn’t always a formula for success, but it’s basically the soy sauce of game design. Add a dash of it to any game to really bring out the umami.


Nova Hearts: The Spark will be released on PC on January 17, 2024. It will be available for free with the rest of the tale planned for release in Summer 2024.

Now, roughly three months after the game's come out, Payday 3 receives its first major expansion pack, Syntax Error.


Following the "long and complicated" period of patching, Payday 3 developer Starbreeze Studios initially had to put its post-launch content plans on the back burner until the dust settled. That time has now come, from the looks of it, as Syntax Error introduces a high-tech new heist focusing on digital robbery. Alongside the heist, players also get three new weapons, and a suite of cosmetics to outfit their bandits with. The issue, though, is that it's not all that affordable.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The original Doom recently celebrated its 30th anniversary, making me feel quite old. As well as being an early blueprint for the FPS genre, id Software's iconic shooter is also a popular modding playground. Sometimes, these mods harken back to even older gaming days.


Modders Gokuma and Kontra Kommando have crafted a love letter to an absolute classic '80s slasher film. Specifically, they've turned Doom into Friday the 13th. More specifically still, they've based it on the NES adaptation, turning the 1989 side-scrolling game into a first-person shooter.


Image via Team Retro-FPS/ModDB.


Set in Camp Crystal Lake – as you would expect – the mod brings back Jason Voorhees to "slaughter all those that would dare to step foot" into the camp. It's up to Doomguy to stop him, presumably. Currently, there's no full release date, but you can download the current beta from ModDB to try it out.


Life before Doom


It's interesting to see this kind of mod. While it could have been just set in the Friday the 13th universe in any respect, the creators chose to breathe new life (resurrect, if you will) into a game that's even older than Doom.


A lot has certainly changed over the decades for the plucky FPS. Thirty years is a long time in any form of media, but to see id Software's legendary 1993 release keep coming back for more is a strong testament to just how important the game has been to the industry.


There are so many Doom mods out there, some of which change up the formula immensely, not to mention the countless ways of porting the game. There's not really anything else like it in the video game world, so hats off to the studio for bringing it to us.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bandai Namco is continuing with their Tekken 8 character highlight trailers, this time putting the spotlight on the enigmatic Yoshimitsu.


Fun fact (not really), I never really got into the Tekken series, but whenever I did play, it was either using Mokujin (if available) or Yoshimitsu. That’s largely because Bandai Namco has a Yoshimitsu in the Soul Calibur series. They may or may not be the same guy. I’m not really up on my lore.




This trailer is so rad. One part of it harkens back to Yoshimitsu’s victory cinematic against Bryan Fury. There are probably other references in there, but as I said, I’m a dilettante. Most of the trailer focuses on a demonstration of the Manji Ninjitsu fighting style, as well as the thirsty Cursed Blade Yoshimitsu. The trailer also caps off with his rage art, as is customary in these trailers.


Yoshimitsu’s design changes heavily in each Tekken game. While the theme is always cyborg ninja, he varies from being more samurai or buglike with each iteration. This time around, we got a good mix with some cosmic highlights. The armor is obviously Japanese-inspired but has a very chitinous look to it. Even with the new design, the over-the-top chivalry and weird goofiness are intact.


While this trailer is a deep dive into the character, we already knew that Yoshimitsu would be in Tekken 8. Truly, it would be strange if he wasn't. He's part of a pretty hefty cast of 32 characters in the base game.


Tekken 8 releases on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC on January 26, 2024. The PS5 demo arrives on December 14, 2023, followed by PC and Xbox on December 21, 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A good parry mechanic is a kind of redemption. Where blocking - aka holding a button to avoid damage - is a concession to the tedious attritional undertow of many action games, parrying - aka pressing a button on cue to cancel damage and often, prep a counter - is the act of cutting through the bullshit. It passively reduces any and all visual and thematic overwhelm the game would have you experience to a question of timing. 


In the face of a good parry mechanic, the grandest of bosses are equivalent to rank-and-file mobs. You're a monster the size of a building? You're the demonic manifestation of a protagonist's mother issues? You're capitalism incarnate? You're wielding eight chainsaws at once? Ehhh. I'm not just going to survive your onslaught. I'm going to dismiss it. All of it: your absurd DPS, your multiple elemental modifiers, your screen-blanketing special effects, your overcooked core concept, the very laws of physics - poof, gone, as though they had never been. Blocking is akin to maintaining a poker face while you're being harangued by your boss over Zoom. Parrying is politely pointing out that your boss has left his camera on, and that he should probably wear trousers when he's at work. It is "nope" said so quietly that it shuts everything else up.

While the new updates have been adding lots of content, it just so happens that much of it is temporary, at best.


More specifically, even though the developer Turn 10 has been hard at work producing new events and adding them to Forza Motorsport's roster of available content, none of them are going to be permanently available as part of the game's relatively barebones Career mode. Updates 2.0 and 3.0 have both introduced two new Career Tours each (with four unique races featured in every Tour), only to have them taken out of the rotation as their respective seasons get wrapped up.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At the time of writing, Starfield has a mixed review score on Steam. Look, it's not a bad game. It's just not the dynamic-shifting epic Bethesda hoped it would be. But still, the studio is keeping that spaceship flying with some new features coming in the future.


Expect updates for Starfield every six weeks


In a recent post on Reddit, a spokesperson for the developer has said the team is grateful for all the feedback they've received. As well as working on some of the ongoing issues with Starfield, there are currently plans to add mod support (finally), city maps, and "new ways of traveling."

What that last one means specifically is anyone's guess, but the post asks everyone to "stay tuned!" These features will be "rolling out with a regular cadence of fixes and updates we expect to have roughly every six weeks." In that respect, 2024 could be an interesting year for the game.


A slow burner


From one of the most hyped games of this generation to something that's been largely forgotten, Starfield seems to be burning up on re-entry (I promise, no more space puns). While the game attracted over 12 million players, it's been tough trying to keep up that pace.


As we approach the beginning of a new year, we could see things change for Todd Howard's cherished project. The PC modding community is no doubt keeping things interesting, but it's going to take some effort to drive up a lot of new interest in Starfield after that burst of hype.


In short: I don't think we'll be seeing a Cyberpunk 2077-esque redemption any time soon.

As the release date nears, developer Bandai Namco has been releasing more and more about the latest entry in its flagship fighting series. We learned about newcomer Reina last month, and recently went hands-on with the game, too – read Game Informer's Tekken 8 preview here. Now, Bandai Namco has revealed the first gameplay trailer for its "mechanized space ninja" Yoshimitsu. 
It did so with a new Tekken 8 gameplay trailer that shows Yoshimitsu ripping and slicing through various fighters in the game's roster. This ninja is no stranger to the Tekken series, having appeared in every mainline numbered Tekken game since the series' start – he's actually my favorite fighter, and for money, this is his best look yet. 
Check him out in the Tekken 8 Yoshimitsu reveal and gameplay trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, Yoshimitsu unsurprisingly relies on his ninja sword to do a lot of damage to enemy fighters. And he does so with the speed the character is known for. 
Tekken 8 hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on January 26, 2024. 
For more about the game, watch the Tekken 8 fighter reveal trailers for characters like Nina Williams, Paul Phoenix, Marshall Law, Jun Kazama, and Reina. After that, read Game Informer's preview thoughts of Tekken 8 after playing the game for a couple of hours.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When we last checked, there was still a lot of uncertainty about the supposed remake of Knights of the Old Republic. A report suggested it was not being worked on by any studio, but Bloomberg's Jason Schreier says it's still in development. So where does that leave us?


Cut to a few weeks later, and Disney's head of gaming – Sean Shoptaw – may have given us a bit more hope. According to Axios, when asked about the possibility of reviving the much-loved Star Wars game, the exec said there's not "a lot I can say on that point for some hopefully obvious reasons."


Image via BioWare/Steam.


The quote goes on to say that "KOTOR is obviously an incredibly popular game, one that we are incredibly proud of and think that there's still a lot of demand for," before ending with, "I'll leave it there."


Leaving money on the table


Given the sheer legacy of the original Knights of the Old Republic, it would seem remiss for Disney to not offer up an official remake of it. Right now, we're in something of a golden age for remakes and remasters, so it would make sense.


However, at this moment in time, things are still up in the air. KOTOR came out in 2003 and is generally regarded as one of the best Star Wars adaptations in gaming. To not bring it back feels like a wasted opportunity, for both old fans and those who never played it the first time round.


Make of Shoptaw's words what you will, but a lot of people will still be hanging onto the idea that Knights is coming back. I mean, it wasn't a definitive "no," that's for sure.

As a beloved RPG series in Japan, Dragon Quest took a pretty long time to make waves in the West. In Japan, games in the mainline series get released on the weekends to stop people skipping work and school, and the franchise has sold millions just in its native home.
Dragon Quest XI changed that. Originally launched in Japan on PS4 and 3DS in 2017, with a Western release following in 2018, it received critical acclaim and is often considered one of the best modern-day turn-based RPGs. The Switch Definitive Edition in 2019 helped spread the love for the charming JRPG series more, and that game alone has sold over six million copies worldwide.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[God of War  Ragnarök's Valhalla DLC is out now on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4, less than a week after it was revealed at The Game Awards 2023. It features a good bit of story content that acts as an epilogue to the events of Ragnarok, and it's packaged within a roguelite structure, meaning it's heavy on combat. Apparently, there's an endgame challenge in Valhalla so difficult that nobody on the dev team could complete it on the DLC's "Show Me Mastery" difficulty, according to Valhalla's director Mihir Sheth. 
"I am so, so curious to see how quickly players will humble us...as they often do...but maybe this time we've beaten them?" Sheth writes on Twitter, as first reported by Wccftech. 
There is an endgame challenge in #GodOfWarRagnarokValhalla that no one on the dev team has completed on the hardest difficulty 'Show Me Mastery'.
December 12, 2023
God of War  Ragnarök, the sequel to 2018's God of War reboot, hit PS5 and PS4 more than a year ago – read Game Informer's review to find out why it was one of our favorite games of 2022. While many fans expected some kind of follow-up to the ending of  Ragnarök, be it a sequel down the road or an expansion, it's safe to say nobody had roguelite DLC on their bingo cards. But a roguelite DLC called Valhalla is exactly what developer Santa Monica Studios announced last week. Now, God of War Ragnarok's Valhalla DLC is out and apparently has the hardest challenge in the entire series. 
You can watch us tackle the first hour of  God of War Ragnarök: Valhalla in this episode of Game Informer Live.

Sony are "investigating" these reports and say that "they have no reason to believe that any other SIE or Sony divisions have been impacted", which reads to me like an acknowledgement that the leaks are legit. Colour that speculation for the moment, however.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["Consider yourself warned! This book contains scenes of graphic violence!" These are the words that adorn the Doom comic book, which was originally released for promotional purposes during 1996's E3 by GT Interactive and Marvel Comics. "Knee-deep in the dead!" is the next bit of text below the logo, referencing the name of the first shareware Doom episode and beautifully describing the blood-soaked cover illustration by Tom Grindberg, who was apparently tickled enough at the thought of drawing this monstrosity to take time away from working on 2000 AD.
The cover is an accurate peek at the gore and demonic entrails that lie within this epic work of sequential storytelling, which required the writing skills of not one, but two gentlemen - Steve "Body Bag" Behling and Michael "Splatter" Stewart. Both Behling and Stewart have a decent body of work between them at Marvel, where they've penned more civilised fare starring the likes of Ant-Man and The Hulk. The Doom comic, in comparison, seems to have been a thing that was written in a fever dream, and DoomWorld, which lovingly hosts scans of this brisk read to this day, describes it appropriately: "Some time in 1996 a couple of guys got together and smoked what was apparently a large amount of crack and then injected pure heroin into their eyes and then proceeded to create what is now known only as 'the Doom comic.'"

Although it's true that the official specs for the 'Switch 2' have not yet been confirmed, Digital Foundry has previously presented a comprehensive dive into how the console will hypothetically perform based on multiple Nvidia chip rumours.

I think that the popularity of "looting", an English word itself looted from Hindi during the time of the East India Company, is one of the worst aspects of the modern games industry and especially of the blockbuster live service game, which strives to keep its audience coming back by means of fresh loot injections at regular intervals.
I distrust how the randomisation element of much video game looting flirts with actual gambling mechanics. I hate that structuring games around the acquisition of loot creates a framework and an appetite for microtransactions and arguably, NFTs. But I am kind of fascinated by the art of designing loot, and especially when it comes to action RPGs such as Diablo 4 and Path Of Exile 2, because it seems to trade on some irresolvable contradictions.

But according to a former Rockstar developer, the decision to go console-first mostly has to do with marketing.


According to former Rockstar developer Mike York (who's previously worked on GTA 5 and Red Dead Redemption 2 and discussed this in a YouTube video) the company always prioritizes "what sells."


"One of the main things I want to touch on is that the reason why a PC port comes later and not the first thing that comes out is because they want to prioritize what sells," he explained. "Most of the time, especially in the past, PlayStation was the big seller. So what the developer would do is they would focus all their energy on m…]]></summary>

That's dramatic, I know. But in all seriousness, the ESA has officially declared E3 done. After more than two decades, the show will cease to exist, following several canceled or online-only years, and a broken partnership with PAX organizer ReedPop. (Disclosure: I used to work under ReedPop, at the now-shuttered USgamer.)




Frankly, this was the death knell we all knew would toll. It's easy to point at the COVID-19 pandemic as part of the problem, and it was. But speaking as someone who attended E3 2019, the decline was already visible.

As is the case with Resident Evil Village, the VR mode is only available for the main story of RE4 Remake, but this time around you have trophies! I've thoroughly enjoyed my time playing RE 4 virtually so far, and while I've yet to complete the lengthy campaign, there are so many epic encounters I'm looking forward to tackling in VR.

According to the document, Atari owns a non-controlling stake of 53% of the company.


The year has seen quite a few acquisitions by Atari. While it started out by buying back catalogs of game properties, they later announced the acquisition of Nightdive Studios and Digital Eclipse, two of the top developers focused on remasters, rereleases, and overall preservation of video games. In July, they announced their partnership with Playmaji along with a “minority investment,” and now we can see that came at the price tag of €4.6 million

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As we near the end of 2023, many apps that we spend dozens, hundreds, and upwards of thousands of hours on give us our stats in a shareable graphic to share on social media. We got the music ones out of the way like Apple and Spotify, so now it’s time for us gamers to bother our mutuals. PlayStation and Xbox have just now released their year-in-review wrap-up stats apps.


Between now and January 12, 2024, people who have played on the PS4 or PS5 consoles will be given a breakdown of what they did in 2023 regarding all things gaming. It’ll start with what your first game of the year was, then your most played games, highlighting your favorite genre of the year, and so forth. 


Xbox players’ “Year in Review” will do basically the same, showing your overall playtime, showcasing your most played month, a piechart breakdown of genres from this year, and so forth. Graphics can be screenshotted for easy sharing on your preferred social media platforms. 




These stats will keep updating until the end of 2023, so things might change!


How to see your year in review for Xbox or PlayStation


For PlayStation players, head over to wrapup.playstation.com and sign in with your Sony account. This can be accessed via mobile device or PC. You can revisit this page as many times as you like between now and when the event is over. You also do not need an active PS Plus subscription or any sort of additional things to view this.


For Xbox players, head over to xbox.com/year-in-review to check your stats. The same applies here as with PlayStation. Simply enter your login credentials and get a thorough breakdown of all your gaming activity on this platform in 2023.

The bulk of the tunes are already on the Persona 3 and Persona 4 vinyl releases, both of which weighed in on four discs.





With that in mind, if you’re looking for the most enduring songs from the two games, you’d probably be better off with the vanilla versions. Persona 4 Golden, for example, doesn’t include Heartbeat, Heartbreak, a song that has been playing on a loop inside my skull for about a decade.


Unfortunately, it doesn’t look like these two albums are going to fit in the Persona 25th Anniversary Slipcase. They will have to sit cold and alone beyond the embracing walls of the rest of the collection. On the positive, their covers are done by Drew Wise, a longtime contributor with Iam8bit and the artist who did all the 25th Anniversary covers. The Persona 3 Portable cover is even a mirror of the vanilla Persona 3 cover, but features the version’s exclusive female protagonist instead.


Both the Persona 3 Portable and Persona 4 Golden vinyl will be up for preorder on December 14, 2023 at 9am PST. Both albums will run you $31.99 American greenbacks.

        <updated>2023-12-12T20:26:13.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been eight years since developer MidBoss released 2064: Read Only Memories, but we're inching ever closer to a return to Neo-San Francisco. A new trailer arrived for Read Only Memories: Neurodiver with yet another updated release window, this time penciling the cyperpunk sequel in for sometime in the first half of 2024.


When Neurodiver was first announced in June 2019, it was planned for a 2020 launch on PC and Mac. More platforms were added as the release window slipped further. It was moved to Q1 2021, then Q1 2022, and finally Q3 2023 before the latest jump to spring 2024. That release is currently set for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and PC via Steam and the Epic Games Store. You can see some of the characters, story, and inspiration behind the series in the trailer below, complete with narration from creative director John "JJSignal" James. 




Neurodiver has ES88 attempting to track down a rogue psychic known as Golden Butterfly, who is hiding in the memories of others and slowly corrupting them. With an ever-changing form, Golden Butterfly's motivation is a mystery. It's up to you to use your own psychic abilities and your genetically-engineered Neurodiver creature to connect with the fragmented memories, repair them, and ultimately put a stop to Golden Butterfly.


These events are set about five years after the story that went down in 2064. As such, there are a handful of returning cast members you'll get to reunite with, like Lexi and Tomcat. MidBoss is once again attempting to deliver a loving sendup to the Japanese adventure games of yore, and that love is particularly potent in the FM synth-infused soundtrack. If you want to sample it all while waiting for launch, the "Pilot Memory" demo is currently available on Steam.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The first limited-time event for Diablo 4, Midwinter Blight, has officially begun. The Midwinter Blight brings with it a period of perpetual darkness and bitter cold that will consume all of Fractured Peaks. As part of the event, players can take on new event quests, upgrade the new event hub, challenge a new event-specific boss, and earn event-specific rewards including a bunch of new cosmetic items.




A new character, Gileon the bard, seeks to reignite the holiday spirit of Kyovashad by enlisting the players help. The event-specific area, Midwinter Square, will allow players to build it up and upgrade it as they slay new Blightfiend enemies around the Fractured Peaks. Several new items can be used to progress the status of the Midwinter Square to unlock new rewards including a mount trophy, class-specific back trophies, weapon cosmetics, the Shard of the Dawn Offensive Legendary Aspect, Gileon's Brew, and more.


Players can eventually also take on an event-specific boss, the Red-Cloaked Horror.


It looks like the event is only available on Seasonal realms, so those who are playing on the Eternal Realm won't be able to partake without creating a Seasonal character. It seems like an odd choice to not allow characters on the Eternal Realm to join the festive event, but there's probably a reason for it.


The Midwinter Blight event in Diablo 4 is live now and lasts through January 2.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Activision revealed via their Call of Duty blog that several multiplayer modes, including Zombies, will be free for Call of Duty MW3 this weekend. The free access event kicks off on December 14 and will last through December 18. Players will be able to jump in and have free access to six maps, four multiplayer modes, Modern Warfare Zombies, and three of the Ground War maps.

Those interested in checking out the multiplayer will have plenty to try out. Here are the maps and modes that are part of the free event:



6v6 Core Multiplayer Maps: Terminal, Rust, Highrise, Shipment, Afghan, Meat


Ground War Maps: Popov Power, Orlov Military Base, Levin Resort


Core Modes: Team Deathmatch, Hardpoint, Domination, Kill Confirmed, Ground War, War


Playlists: Rustment 24/7 (Shipment and Rust), War Mode, 6v6 Moshpit (featuring Highrise, Meat, Afghan, Terminal), Ground War, Modern Warfare Zombies



Overall it's a nice mix of maps. Terminal, Rust, and Shipment are fan favorites, whereas the map Meat is a brand new map. Players will be able to level up very quickly via Rustment 24/7 which will allow them to check out some of the later-level unlocks to see if they like what is there.


It appears the full Modern Warfare Zombies mode will be included in the free access as well, which is worth checking out. Instead of traditional Zombies maps, MW3 features a DMZ/Warzone style open-world Zombies map.


The Call of Duty MW3 Free Access event begins on December 14 at 1 p.m. ET and will run through December 18 at 10 a.m. ET.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mouse, an upcoming classic first-person shooter sporting a vintage rubber hose animation style, turned heads in May with its first look at gameplay. Although that initial showing was very much a work in progress, today’s video offers a more polished look at what’s to come.
The noir game stars a private-eye rodent cleaning up his corruption-riddled city by using his trusty tommy gun to mow down scores of mouse gangsters in cartoonishly violent fashion. Additionally, we get a look at other lethal methods, such as tossing dynamite, shooting down pianos to crash on top of foes, or just knocking goons' heads off with a good punch. Between all of that, the mouse protagonist consumes spinach and tea for presumably health while engaging in other activities such as collecting baseball cards and chatting with characters.
Mouse is the debut title from developer Fumi Games, and the trailer ends with the reveal of a 2025 release window. 


Mouse is slated to come to PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC. It joins the growing ranks of confirmed 2025 titles such as Grand Theft Auto VI, Monster Hunter: Wilds, Big Walk, Usual June, and Pony Island 2: Panda Circus.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Well, it's been about a hundredth of a femtosecond, let's see what people are trying to port Doom onto now. Oh my, would you look at that! It appears as though it's possible to get id Software's iconic FPS to "run" on cells.


In a meeting of technology and biology, PhD student Lauren "Ren" Ramlan at MIT (as shared by Reddit user AnNdPh) has figured out a way to use E. coli cells to sort of run Doom. Now, I'm not scientifically minded, so I don't fully understand how they do it.




In a nutshell: what they've been able to do is tweak or modify the cells to – for want of a better term – turn them into monitor pixels. This has then allowed them to display the game in a very rudimentary way.


I hope you have half a millennium to spare


While this means the E. coli cells are technically displaying the game rather than actually running it, it's still impressive to see Doom being ported in this way.


Ren also notes that the game is only able to run at one frame every 8.33 hours. Using this figure, they estimate it would take around 600 years to complete it in its entirety. Even the likes of Skyrim can't compete with that kind of longevity.


With the original Doom recently celebrating its 30th anniversary, the legacy of the iconic shooter continues unabated. One can't help wonder where the FPS genre would be without the 1993 release, but one's thing for sure, no one's running Call of Duty on E. coli cells.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Two years ago, developers Fntastic debuted their "open world survival MMO" The Day Before with a fairly lengthy trailer (which has since been scrubbed from their official YouTube channel, but it's been preserved by IGN and Gamespot). It shows a couple of players scavenging a post-pandemic American city slick with detailed lighting effects and reactive zombie hordes. There's crafting, cracked glass, and even a horror tease as a player peers around a corridor with a torch. It was an MMO that promised a mixture of The Last Of Us and The Division, and it quickly became the most wishlisted game on Steam.
Now, days after releasing into early access, developers Fntastic have shut down and you can't purchase the game anymore. Does it come as a surprise? Not really, considering the final product wasn't what they promised - not even close. Instead of an MMO, it was barely an extraction shooter. Consider my words below a record of a rancid time had across its short-lived early access release, then. A time when I would've rather handed a stinging nettle £40 to line my socks than spend another minute in this empty husk.

There's never been a better time to get into Ace Attorney. Developer-publisher Capcom has spent the last few years remastering and re-releasing every game in the series, and with the Apollo Justice trilogy, you can now play every mainline game on modern consoles. And even though the three games in this collection are unchanged story-wise, after going hands-on, we can comfortably say that they've never felt better.
The collection contains three games: Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney, Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney – Dual Destinies, and Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney – Spirit of Justice – …]]></summary>

"It's with a heavy heart that we must announce yet another difficult decision," the post reads.

After more than two decades, the long-running video game conference where developers, publishers, businesses, and press met to check out new games, watch reveals, and more, has been permanently canceled. 
The first E3 took place in 1995 and the last in-person conference happened in 2019. The 2020 event was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but E3 returned for one last bout in 2021 with an all-digital event. The 2022 show was canceled, and this year's event, which was set to happen with ReedPop, was canceled as well.

The last in-person E3 conference happened in 2019 before the COVID-19 pandemic and other complications prevented it from coming back in full form since. Despite struggles, the ESA attempted to bring E3 back in various ways. 
It was canceled in 2020 as a result of the pandemic; the 2021 E3 was an all-digital event; the 2022 show was canceled, and this year's attempt with PAX organizer ReedPop was canned, too.

"After more than two decades of hosting an event that has served as a central showcase for the U.S. and global video game industry, the Entertainment Software Association has decided to bring E3 to a close," ESA president and CEO Stanely Pierre-Louis told The Washington Post. "We know the entire industry, players and creators alike have a lot of passion for E3. We share the passion. We know it's difficult to say goodbye to such a beloved event, but it's the right thing to do given the new opportunities our industry has to reach fans and partners." 
Pierre-Louis told The Washington Post that E3's closure means video games and the surrounding business "has blossomed in different ways," noting that any of the major game companies can create their own individual showcases. He's likely alluding to the format popularized by Nintendo with its Nintendo Directs, which other publishers like Xbox and PlayStation utilize now. "That's exciting for our industry, and it means it's an opportunity for them to explore how to engage new audiences in different ways."

Following the events of Tekken 7, the stage for Tekken 8’s story is set up to be perhaps the most over-the-top yet. In the six months since the defeat of Heihachi Mishima, his son, Kazuya Mishima, has installed a reign of terror over the planet using his devil powers. And while the setup is, quite frankly, a lot to take in, if the first four chapters I played are any indication, the level of spectacle and bombast reaches new levels in Tekken 8’s Story Mode.
The first chapter opens with Lars Alexandersson on a high-tech plane. He mentions the mission is to take down "evi…]]></summary>

Cured, judging from Rivals’ more palatable monetisation plans, of the myxomatosis that killed it in the first place.


From what I played, Tribes 3 can definitely bring back happy memories of zipping around, nicking flags and copping Spinfuser blasts, and the finished article may well have the chops to create some new ones. At the same time, the playtest build was conspicuously short on much of what makes Tribes really feel like Tribes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Terra Nil, the "reverse city builder" from developer Free Lives and publisher Devolver Digital, is coming to Switch next week. More specifically, it will hit the Nintendo console on December 18, as revealed in a new trailer you can watch below. 
While many simulation games task you with creating a new metropolis or saving a colony of humans from post-apocalyptic conditions, Terra Nil instead tasks you with saving nature from climate change and the effects of humans. Instead of building roadways and buildings, you build windmills, calcifiers, and more. 


As you can see, Terra Nil is not only a unique spin on the simulation genre, but a pretty one. It's sure to pop on Nintendo Switch OLED models, too, if you have one.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Update, 12/12/23:
Fntastic, the studio behind The Day Before, announced yesterday that it was shutting down. It said at the time that servers for the game, which launched last week on December 7, would remain operational but that the future of The Day Before is unknown. Now, less than 24 hours later, The Day Before is no longer available for purchase on Steam (although you can still visit the page). 
Plus, anyone who purchased the game is eligible for a refund, according to Fntastic. 
"Answer to those who ask for a refund," a Fntastic tweet reads. "[We and publisher Mytona are] currently working with Steam to allow refunds for any player who chooses to request one, regardless of the game time. Fntastic received $0 and will receive nothing from The Day Before sales."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The party poppers are out, the finger food is ready and waiting to be served, and the guest list for Doom's 30th birthday party is well and truly set. Well, it would be if Doomguy ever lowered the drawbridge to his flying space castle high above the Earth's orbit. I did try and get a radio signal out earlier, but the grumpy sod never responded. Probably too busy organising his trophy case in his man cave, to be honest. But let's face it. Doomguy wouldn't be much fun at a birthday party anyway. He'd be too busy ripping and tearing into his presents to give anyone the time of day, let alone a polite thank you, and then he'd be working on ripping and tearing apart said presents in a display of strength and machismo. 
So Doom's hellspawn have got together to throw their own party for the occasion, and let me tell you, they're having a riotous good time all by themselves. Well, most of them are, anyway, as there are some demons here that wouldn't know how to have fun even if was seared across their skulls with the beam of a BFG9000. Here's every classic Doom enemy ranked on a scale of the most miserable wallflowers to the life and (undead) soul of the party.

Apologies, I realise that reference is more appropriate to Paradox's other recent strategy release, Star Trek: Infinite, but I don't know the Stellaris fiction well enough to think of an appropriate in-joke. If you are similarly lacking in Stellaris knowledge, please rejoice in the fact that Nexus is a stripped-down, sped-up, turn-based version of the legendary space sim, which emphasises snappy tactical and strategic relationships over backstory.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hogwarts Legacy hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC back in February – you can read Game Informer's Hogwarts Legacy review here. Now, as 2023 comes to a close, Google has released the top 10 trending searches in games on Google over the year and in the top slot is Hogwarts Legacy.

While many were likely searching for new trailers, gameplay, and information about the game, there's no doubt some of the Google searching for this game stems from Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling's inflammatory statements about the trans community. Publisher Warner Bros. Interactive says Rowling was not involved with the creation of Hogwarts Legacy, which was developed by Avalanche, but given it's based on the Harry Potter franchise she created, she undoubtedly made money off of it. Nonetheless, it was the subject of many top trending searches on Google. 
As for what that means, Google describes it like so: "This data shows the top trending searches in the U.S., which means the 'trending' inquiries are the searches that had such a high spike in traffic over a sustained period in 2023 as compared to 2022." 
With that in mind, here's the top 10 trending searches in the U.S. for games on Google in 2023:

Whether there’s merit to these rumors, of course, remains to be seen. There’s little use speculating about specs for a rumored, potentially nonexistent console.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Dlala Studios and publisher Walt Disney Games released Disney Illusion Island, a 2D Metroidvania-esque platformer, exclusively on Switch earlier this year. It was nominated for Best Family Game at The Game Awards 2023 – check out all the winners here – and now, Dlala has revealed it is launching new content this week. 
More specifically, the Keeper Up update will go live in Disney Illusion Island for free on Wednesday, December 13. It includes new time trial challenges, quality of life updates like an improved map, and more. 

"In this fast-paced new experience, players must try and beat the clock and show off their parkour prowess, thanks to a set of new challenges arranged by the 'Mavens of Monoth,' a group of 'old Monoth' enthusiasts who want to see if anyone knows how to navigate these lands better (and faster) than them," a press release reads. "Upon entering a course, a timer will tick away as players scramble to grab collectibles through remixed areas of the world, making their way to the finish line in the best time possible." 
Elsewhere in the Keeper Up update, Dlala studios says Disney Illusion Island will receive "a host of quality of life updates, including new accessibility features, new gallery unlocks, and an updated map." 
Disney Illusion Island is available exclusively on Switch, and the new Keeper Update goes live this week on December 13. 


For more about the game, read Game Informer's Disney Illusion Island review and then check out this behind-the-scenes feature about the making of Disney Illusion Island. After that, read this feature about how the Disney Illusion Island team created one of the best musical scores of the year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Banishers: Ghosts Of New Eden is a game of twos. It has two protagonists and two broad ways of playing, leading to two broad narrative outcomes, and is created by a company who, as Don’t Nod’s lead narrative designer Elise Galmard explained to me at a preview event, feel like they make games for two different audiences - fans of noodly narrative intrigues on the one hand, and of fantasy combat games on the other. Among the game's challenges, of course, is to blend these halves convincingly.
A spiritual (hah) follow-up of sorts to 2018’s fairly well-received Vampyr, it takes place in the alt-historical realm of New Eden, which is kind of 17th century colonial North America through the lens of Dragon Age: Inquisition with a pinch of Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice. The titular Banishers are a ghost-hunting couple, the Scotsman Red MacRaith and the Cuban Antea Duarte. Antea is killed at the very beginning of the game, during a battle with an especially noxious spook, but she soon returns as a spirit, and your overall story objective is to either resurrect her body or help her "Ascend" to the afterlife.

As of today, the best prices available in the UK and US are at Overclockers (£330) and Amazon ($358). Both retailers offer the CPU with a free copy of the truly stunning Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In just over a month's time, the entire mainline Ace Attorney series will finally be playable on PC with the arrival of the Apollo Justice Trilogy. Launching on January 25th 2024, this collection bundles together the fourth, fifth and sixth games in Capcom's excellent lawyer 'em up - Apollo Justice, Dual Destinies and Spirit Of Justice - which originally launched on the Nintendo DS and 3DS across a ten year period between 2007 and 2016. It's been funny revisiting the earlier cases of these games after so much time has passed. Apollo's name may be the one on the box, but the series' original cover star Phoenix Wright is never far from the front lines - not only does he get tangled up on the wrong side of the law in Apollo's own debut outing, but he's back as a full-time defence attorney on the (w)right side of the legal bench in the other two. 
At the time, poor old Apollo always felt like he got the short end of the stick as Capcom tried to figure out what to do with the series, and to some extent, he still does - for he never quite gets out from under Phoenix's shadow to completely hold court on his own two feet. But now, after 2021's excellent Great Ace Attorney Chronicles proved that neither time, setting or its lead defence need to be set in stone for the series to carry on, the pressure does feel ever so slightly less intense on a second visit. There's no denying Apollo still has a bit of an uphill climb on his hands, but if, like me, you've been waiting for these games to be freed from their Nintendo-bound prison, this is arguably the best glow-up Capcom's done to the series to date.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Every weekend, indie devs show off current work on Twitter's #screenshotsaturday tag. And every Monday, I bring you a selection of these snaps and clips. This week, like many weeks, my head is full of Metal Gear Rising's RULES OF NATURE. But unlike most weeks, it feels relevant. This week I saw an indie game where you slow-mo slice weapons and armour off robots in a forest and oh, that's doubly rules of nature right there. Plenty of other attractive and interesting indie games are about too, come have a look!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Doom turns 30 this year, and that's a cause for celebration. There are many reasons to commemorate id Software's 1993 jaunt through the demon-infested corridors of Mars, from the fact that you can play it on every device known to man to its undying modding scene that even lets you pet Cacodemons. But I have a personal connection with Doom that's a bit special. It's the first game that made me so sick I wanted to puke.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A year or two ago I interviewed an actual, practising witch, the wonderful Damien Crawford of Purgatory Dungeoneer fame, about how videogames represent magic. I badly need Crawford's thoughts on Emberstorm Entertainment's Reka, published by Fireshine Games, which has just been slapped with a Steam early access release window of Q2 2024.
In this curious, moody survival-ish adventure, you're an apprentice witch who travels about the land in a chicken-legged cottage loaned out by your mentor, the Baba Jaga. The cottage isn't just mobile - you can expand it with second-floor extensions and decorate the interior with jaunty wooden furniture. Sadly, there doesn't appear to be an option to employ gingerbread during construction, nor can you currently fly about on broomstick, but perhaps all that'll be added on the road to 1.0. Here's the latest trailer.

The Maw tends to be at low ebb over the Xmas period, because it has a violent allergy to festive cheer. But for the moment, it still clamours for News.


Some game releases we're pondering this week: squad-based RTS Stargate: Timekeepers (12th Dec), Settlers spiritual follow-up Pioneers of Pagonia (13th Dec, early access), anime chainsaw metroidvania Cookie Cutter (14th Dec), "pixel pulp" visual novel Bahnsen Knights (14th Dec), and multiversal metroidvania Trinity Fusion (15th Dec).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[“When people read anything, no matter the source, they will believe it.” So says Doom designer John Romero on the subject of his relationship with John Carmack. Together, the pair built id Software and the FPS genre as we know it - before the cracks started to show during the difficult development of Quake, ending their professional partnership.
Yet any lasting acrimony has now dissipated. That became apparent when Romero’s new autobiography, ‘Doom Guy: Life In First Person’, showed up on shelves with a glowing back cover quote from Carmack. The latter praised Romero’s “remarkable memory”, and waxed wistfully about their shared impact on the gaming medium. “For years, I thought that I had been born too late and missed out on participating in the heroic eras of computing,” Carmack wrote. “Only much later did I realise that Romero and I were at the nexus of a new era - the 3D game hackers.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[32 inches. That's what I'm looking for in a gaming monitor, but normally screens of this size are just expensive. As you may have guessed from the title though, you can pick up a 32-inch LG gaming monitor for just $187 today, nearly half its original price. 
That's a wicked deal for the LG 32GN600, a VA-panel monitor with excellent contrast, a 2560x1440 resolution and 165Hz refresh rate with FreeSync and G-Sync support.

There has been some negative feedback, however, from players upset that player movement is now slower than it was during the beta.

Except, it's not slower, say the developers - there have been no changes to the movement system at all. Instead they're investigating why it apparently feels slower, and say they've found the culprits.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently I helped a friend spec out a gaming PC to play Baldur's Gate 3 and other triple-A releases, and we opted for a machine with an RTX 4070 Ti graphics card as that fit within her £2000 budget and allows for excellent performance with gaming monitors up to 4K while leaving enough cash free for a high-end CPU and other nice components. 
Today though, you can pick up a pre-built RTX 4070 Ti gaming PC for way less than that - just £1299 - when you get it from Stormforce Gaming in the UK. This build includes a 12th-gen Core i5 processor, 16GB of DDR4 memory, a 1TB PCIe 4.0 NVMe SSD and a 750W power supply, all for £500 off its listed price.

After a too-soon dabble in early access, I was already intrigued by its setting. You'll never guess.
It's a welcome change from dusty radiation or goddamn elves again, and the RPG structure feels flexible and fairly responsive to your actions even before you start picking sides and ideologies. It hasn't quite stolen my heart, but it may well steal some of my christmas.

I have, and this year, despite not having had to stay up until 5am covering it, I'm grumpy enough to point out that we don't actually have to be nice about the great, clomping shiny trainer of marketing in 2023, the year everyone was laid off.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During The Game Awards, we learned that The Outlast Trials is wrapping up its time in PC early access and is heading to consoles next March. The game was first announced in 2019 and entered Steam Early Access in May. 
The game is a co-op take on the popular horror series, with up to four players controlling test subjects fighting to survive in a dangerous test facility. Check out its latest trailer below (headphone users beware: it's got a lot of shrieking streamers). 


The 1.0 launch will include a new Toy Factory trial with new MK challenges. It will also feature new evidence documents, character customization, cell decorations, legendary outfits, an increased level cap, weekly programs, and other quality-of-life improvements. 
The game will be sold alone in a $39.99 Standard Edition and a $49.99 Deluxe Edition that includes the Regent Start Pack, giving players four legendary skins, exclusive cell items, posters, and player icons. 
The Outlast Trials launches on March 5 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alan Wake 2 hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on October 27, but shortly before its release, developer Remedy Entertainment revealed that it would be getting a New Game Plus mode with an alternative narrative and nightmare difficulty, amongst other things. During The Game Awards 2023 last night, Remedy, which picked up three wins during the show, revealed that "The Final Draft" update, which includes the aforementioned New Game Plus mode, goes live next week. 
More specifically, The Final Draft hits Alan Wake 2 on Monday, December 11. It features a new ending to the story of Alan Wake that Remedy says will spark speculation and theory crafting among its most dedicated fans. Plus, there's new lore to find in the form of new videos and manuscript pages. 


"Players will retain all Weapons, Charms, and character upgrades earned during their first playthrough," a blog post about The Final Draft reads. "They should come in handy when you seek the ultimate challenge of trying out the new Nightmare Difficulty level. Brace yourselves for intensified enemies, strategic gameplay, and an adrenaline-pumping experience that will push your skills to the limit." 
You will find all of your unlocked weapons in the first available shoebox for the characters, so don't expect to immediately start the game with all of your weaponry. 
Remedy says The Final Draft update also includes numerous bug fixes and slight performance optimizations that will be further detailed in the complete update notes, which go live alongside the update on Monday. 
The Final Draft update for Alan Wake 2 goes live at 10 a.m. PT/1 p.m. ET on Monday, December 11, on all platforms where you can play the game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Game Awards 2023 was a massive night for games, with more than 30 announcements, premieres, and more. It ended with developer Larian Studios taking home the Game of the Year award for its critically acclaimed RPG, Baldur's Gate 3. Shortly after the win, Larian revealed that the game was now available on Xbox Series X/S, meaning it's finally playable on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.
 

Baldur's Gate 3 director Swen Vincke tweeted, "I had one job and that was to announce this if we won an award – sorry all but happy it's out there," meaning this might have been meant to be an on-stage announcement. Nonetheless, everyone's happy Vincke and the team took the extra time to praise its team of developers and thank fans for the reception during the Game of the Year award acceptance speech instead. 
Xbox players, it’s party time.

The game puts you in the cockpit of a variety of mech suits, which you can customize the look and weapons of, to take on other players across a variety of modes. The biggest battlefield is a 48-player battle royale. If you’d rather play alongside friends, a co-op option allows three-to-six players to team up to complete specialized missions. Other destinations include a 3v3 arena mode and a 6v6 battlefield mode. See the game in action below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As Dusk Falls, the narrative adventure game about two families linked together by a burglary gone wrong, hit Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC in July of last year. More than a year later, developer Interior/Night is bringing the game to PlayStation, but you'll have to wait just a bit longer to play it.
That's because As Dusk Falls hits PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 on March 7, 2024. Interior/Night announced this news during The Game Awards 2023 tonight. It will also launch on the Epic Games Store and GOG on PC the same day. The studio released a new trailer to celebrate the announcement, and you can check it out for yourself below:


This new PS5 version of As Dusk Falls includes new exclusive features like haptic feedback and touchpad controls. Plus, a new audio description accessibility feature will be available on all platforms in March.
"In this uncompromising crime drama of betrayal, sacrifice, and resilience, players explore the entangled lives of two families across decades, starting in 1998 with a robbery gone wrong in small-town Arizona," a press release reads. "The story can be replayed to discover the vastly different outcomes depending on the decisions taken. As Dusk Falls has an innovative multiplayer mode supporting up to 8 players locally, online, or as a combination of both, using controllers or the companion app for Android or iOS." 
As Dusk Falls won the Games For Impact award at last year's Game Awards. For more about the game, read Game Informer's As Dusk Falls review.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The final chapter of horrifying cooperative FPS GTFO is out now, sending it off with a scream as the developers look forward to their newly announced next game. The update,  Rundown 8.0 Duality includes new expeditions, new awful beings to murder you, and new weapons to attempt to stop them. It looks awful in a lovely way. Maybe I'll finally pluck up the courage to give GTFO a proper go, especially as a free trial weekend is running on Steam and the game's discounted too. I'd have to be some sort of coward to ignore that. Some sort of coward who doesn't want to creep and fight through hordes of horrid meatmonsters.

A kick in the dino groin to this year's monster hunting pretender Wild Hearts, perhaps? Who can say. Formally unveiled at tonight's Game Awards, this new Monster Hunter is coming in 2025, and looks to be the jazzed-up successor to Monster Hunter: World. That's not a diss on Rise (which was excellent). Just that it's being developed for PC and consoles first, rather than Switch. And it looks rad as heck. Come and watch the reveal trailer below.

They're called Echoes of the Fallen and Rising Tide, and the former is available to play right now.
Echoes of the Fallen adds new story chapters that takes place before the finale of Final Fantasy XVI. Clive and the gang follow the origins of a mysterious crystal to a strange ruin filled with deadly defenses tied to Eikons and plenty of monsters. Rising Tide is set to launch in Spring 2024 and is a bit more mysterious, but we do see Clive taking on what may be the scariest enemy in all of Final Fantasy: Tonberry King. Oh, and Leviathan pops up too. 


You can purchase each DLC separately or together for a discount in an expansion pass. You can read our review of Final Fantasy XVI here.]]></summary>

Running on Unreal Engine 5 and set in fictional, near-future Colton County, USA, it's a PvPvE affair in which you roam a big ruined map either alone or as a team, fighting other players, NPCs and renegade "natural" elements. Published by Level Infinite, it'll be a premium game with live service elements and microtransactions, and there's no release date yet.

        <updated>2023-12-08T04:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Game Awards are packed with eager looks at highly anticipated games, but the ceremony is full of plenty of surprises too. One of them is a flashy Metroidvania called Tales of Kenzera: Zau, the debut game from Surgent Studios.
Zau is a boy on a quest to bring his father back from the dead. Guided by Kalunga, the God of Death, he uses his ability as a warrior shaman to defeat the ancestral spirits that roam the land of Kenzera. His main tools are a pair of magical masks; with the Moon mask he can manipulate time and crystalize enemies, and the Sun mask allows him to launch fiery spears. Studio founder Abubakar Salim says that the two masks are reminiscent of the Devil May Cry series with the way they allow the player to flip between ranged and melee modes.

The world is inspired by Bantu lore and imagery, with bright colors and mythical beasts. Additionally, the game will be scored by Nainita Desai, a British composer who made the music for Half Mermaid's Telling Lies and Immortality.
Salim founded Surgent in 2019, but most gamers would currently recognize him as the voice of Bayek from Assassin's Creed Origins. According to him, the passing of his father motivated him to create a new project – he wanted to tell a story of grief in the form of a video game. With assistance from the Ridley Scott Creative Group and Critical Role, five years later, Tales of Kenzera: Zau tells that story.
The trailer ended with the news that Tales of Kenzera: Zau will be coming to PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC on April 23, 2024.]]></summary>

Earlier this week, they invited me down to their Guildford offices for a quick, informal chat about the game, which I am going to characterise as Fable meets Microsoft Flight Simulator.

There have been beta sessions before now, but the game is getting a full, proper launch next Summer. The exact date is up in the air still, but according to a blog post from the developers, it will be announced as soon as they can pin it down. Check out the latest trailer below.


In The First Descendant, you play as, you guessed, Descendants – a group of unique characters that each have distinct abilities and movesets. Your goal is to defend the planet from invaders called Colossi using the game's third-person shooting and RPG mechanics. The new trailer gives us a cinematic look at one of those fights, this time showcasing an entirely new Descendant.
There's no gameplay in this trailer, but the team assures fans that they're working to refine said gameplay, based on feedback from the nearly two million players who checked out their last open beta session. The main purpose of that beta was to test crossplay features, which makes sense, since the game is launching on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC. Check it out for free when it launches simultaneously on all of those platforms in Summer 2024.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Sharkmob, makers of the battle royale Vampire: The Masquerade- Bloodhunt, have revealed a new open-world extraction shooter called Exoborne.
The game is a tactical shooter set in an apocalyptic Earth that is being torn asunder by extreme forces of nature, such as massive tornadoes and lightning storms. These calamities were somehow caused by the failure of a mysterious program called Project Rebirth, and now players find themselves fighting for survival in an environmentally unstable southwestern U.S. You play as a Reborn, a survivor outfitted in enhanced suits called Exo-Rigs with special weapons and augment your abilities to survive the myriad of threats, both human and elemental. Check out the cinematic trailer below. 


Exoborne drops players into a shared open world where, either alone or in a party of allies, they will scavenge for resources and extract them while fending off other players. The Exo-Rig bestows special abilities, such as the ability to leap very high, and comes outfitted with a grappling hook and even a parachute, which players can use to engage in aerial combat or even ride maelstroms (think Just Cause). 
The gameplay combines PvE and PvP and features an evolving narrative and sidequests that unfold throughout the otherwise multiplayer framework. Between primary tasks, you’ll also engage in dynamic public events and group missions. Powerful forces of nature add a chaotic wrinkle to fights; expect to engage in shootouts while getting swept up by tornados.
Characters, weapons, and Exo-Rigs can be customized with various mods and upgrades using the resources you extract. As a premium live-service game, Sharkmob plans to support Exoborne with various content updates, such as new live events.
Exborne is being developed in Unreal Engine 5 and is coming to PC and consoles at an undetermined date.]]></summary>

The ambitious space-exploration title promised a universe of possibilities and has since become the poster child for bouncing back from a challenging launch period.
To celebrate the 10th anniversary of the first teaser trailer, Sean Murray and Hello Games returned to Geoff Keighley's stage, now called The Game Awards, to give a brief retrospective and tease what's next. After a rundown of the last 10 years of active development of No Man's Sky, including several free updates, improvements, and expansions, the trailer teases big plans for 2024, with something that appears to involve more intricate space stations within the game.
Check out the No Man's Sky 10-Year Anniversary Trailer for yourself below: 


No Man's Sky was released in 2016 to mixed reviews but received myriad updates and improvements in the years since, delivering something beyond what was even promised in the lead-up to launch. Today, it is widely praised by critics and fans and is put forward as the foremost model for how to improve a game after a rocky launch.]]></summary>

And yet here we are, with tonight's Game Awards reveal that they're making a Marvel Blade game. What are the chances? Will this second bite at making a (hopefully good this time) vampire game be the one? It's still early on in development, from the sounds of things, but here's the reveal trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Arkane has announced that it's jumping into the Marvel universe by announcing a video game based on Blade.
The title, aptly named Marvel's Blade, is coming from Arkane Lyon, the team behind Deathloop and the Dishonored series, in collaboration with Marvel Games. Announced on Blade's 50th anniversary, the game is described as a single-player, mature-rated third-person action-adventure game set in Paris. The city has been plagued with vampires, so it's up to you to put a stop to it. Though it will feature plenty of action, it's described as a "very Arkane game", so fans should potentially expect it to have several of the studio's signature immersive sim hallmarks.

The trailer begins rather innocently in 1995 with a group of four young high school friends –  Swann, Nora, Autumn, and Kat – partying together without a care in the world. The video then takes a darker turn with hints that something sinister, and perhaps otherworldly, flipping their lives on their heads. 27 years pass with no contact between the friends, but the secret they swore not to talk about again brings them back together. Lost Records: Bloom & Rage is the first title of Don't Nod's Montreal studio.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dave the Diver publisher Nexon and developer Neople have revealed The First Berserker: Khazan, a single-player action RPG that is the next entry in the long-running Dungeon & Fighter universe. The First Berserker: Khazan stands in stark contrast to the most recent entry in this universe, DNF Duel, a multiplayer fighting game released last year. 
Neople says the DNF series combines the fast-paced, higher-energy action of old-school brawlers with classic RPG elements, all wrapped in an anime-esque art style. However, with The First Berserker: Khazan, players can expect hack 'n' slash combat and plenty of customization. 
Check it out for yourself in The First Berserker: Khazan reveal trailer below: 


"The Pell Los Empire has been saved – at a cost," a press release reads. "After the Great General Khazan and Archmage Ozma defeat the Berserk Dragon Hismar and the Dragon Legion, players will step into the shoes of Khazan as he is falsely accused of treason and exiled beyond the empire."
Neople says in The First Berserker: Khazan, combat takes center stage in Khazan's quest for vengeance against those who orchestrated his downfall, "marked by intense, aggressive, and ever-changing styles of battle." 
To survive, players must master combat, upgrade character skills, and combine weapons and armor (each with unique perks). The more missions cleared, the tougher the bosses, but defeating them and finishing missions earns players powerful gear and abilities. 
The First Berserker: Khazan will launch on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC sometime in the future.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League has been in development for a long time; by the time it comes out next year, it will have been nine years since Rocksteady's last game. But after years of secret development and repeated delays, it's finally around the corner, and The Game Awards just gave us our latest look. See for yourself in the trailer below:


The notion of killing the Justice League, some of the most powerful people in the DC universe, has always felt like an impossible task for the Suicide Squad, and the more we see of these corrupted superheroes, the harder it looks. This trailer gives us a look at Green Lantern's arsenal of hard light weaponry, the Flash's speed and lightning bolts, Wonder Woman's lasso of truth, and a shadowy Batman (which is potentially related to Scarecrow's fear gas, though that's just speculation).
Luckily, the Squad is equipped with a wide array of weapons and traversal techniques, making them way more mobile than they would normally be in the comics or movies. We get a good look at new gameplay of them swinging, soaring, and shooting as well, which you can experience solo with AI companions or online with friends.
But the best part of the new trailer? The release date hasn't changed. We can take on the Justice League next year on February 2.]]></summary>

Players explore the open world of Isla Nublar, which teems with a variety of newly escaped dinosaurs in a fully reactive world. Stealth seems to be more emphasized than combat, as players must use their intelligence, skills, and wit to outsmart and avoid John Hammond's prehistoric creations.

"New Eden, 1695: Antea and Red are lovers and Banishers, trained spirit-hunters protecting people from lingering specters," a press release reads.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been a while since we last got a proper good look at Senua's Saga: Hellblade II, but this year's Game Awards hasn't just given us a new trailer for Ninja Theory's long-awaited sequel, but a rough release window as well. Coming in 2024 to PC, Xboxes and Game Pass, it hopefully won't be long now before we can continue Senua's story and maybe slay some cool looking giants.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hideo Kojima, the director behind Metal Gear Solid and Death Stranding, and Jordan Peele, the director of movies such as Get Out and Nope, are making a new cloud-based project for Xbox Game Studios called OD Announced tonight during The Game Awards, the project also stars Sophia Lillis (It) and Hunter Schafer (Euphoria).
In typical Kojima fashion, the trailer doesn't illuminate much. We see several characters reading (and sometimes failing to do so) a tongue twister before Lillis' character screams in horror at what they see behind a door. 
Talking onstage, Kojima was joined by Peele to mostly compliment each other's work. However, Kojima stressed OD is, in fact, a game. But it's also a movie. And apparently something unlike much else. Or so he says. Peele said it was "crazy." I lost the plot after a while.
Anyways, check it out for yourself:




OD isn't the only project Kojima is working on. His studio, Kojima Productions, is also developing a sequel to Death Stranding.]]></summary>

Announced during tonight's Game Awards, No Rest For The Wicked is quite a different kettle of cursed fish compared to Moon's previous games, but I'm also quietly intrigued by it at the same time. For starters, this is an online ARPG that combines the top-down combat of games like Diablo 4 with the patient, weighty boss battles of your Elden Soulslikes.

Terrific, demonic rhythm-basher THUMPER is getting a sequel of sorts called THRASHER, created by the first game's artist and composer Brian Gibson. It’s a weirdo racer in which you use gesture controls to evolve the creature you're controlling, in a “breakneck race for survival that begins at the dawn of time”. Which is certainly a concept. Will there be any flying hell triangles in this one? Will my thumbs be able to keep up, seven years after almost breaking them against the sneering face of THUMPER's world 3?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For many years, the GOG.com affiliate program has been a great way to support the project. By using our affiliate links to buy your favorite games, you granted us a small commission from GOG.com – without having to spend more than the original price.
Earlier this year, GOG.com announced the discontinuation of its old affiliate program. Instead of using a simple referral link, they are now using two external affiliation networks that contain cross-site tracking, as considered by many ad blockers. Since we have been affiliated with GOG.com since 2009, we were able to use the legacy referral links for a couple of months after they initially discontinued them.
Unfortunately, our affiliate links were put to rest effective November 22nd, 2023.
Since we don't feel comfortable that you would have to use external affiliation networks just to support the project, and because tracking users is against our project policies, we decided not to join the new program.
We still value GOG.com as an excellent source for legally purchasing games supported by ScummVM. Even though we are not affiliated with them anymore, we'll continue to support their releases, e.g. by adding and updating the game data files' signatures for the ScummVM supported games that are available for purchase from GOG.com in our detection database and providing links to their releases in our list of available games.
Thank you GOG.com and everybody who used our affiliate link for your support over the last 14 years!
