He will assist you in combat, essentially serving as a target dummy for better or worse when engaged in larger-scale battles. But to keep Mutt happy, you've got to keep him fed, of course. Here is how to get food for Mutt and feed him in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2.

Henry will eventually start having blurry vision before leading to you dying and having to reload from the most recent checkpoint. Here is how you can stop bleeding in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2.





How to stop bleeding in KCD2


The primary way to stop bleeding in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is to use Bandages. Go into your inventory to the Utility section, select the Bandage, then hit the 'E' key to use it. You will then get a pop-up window asking which body part you want to patch. In order to completely stop bleeding, you will have to patch up every body part that is not at 0%. Each Bandage you use will stop the bleeding on that body part.

Grab the Spade against the post near the body


As Bozhena suggested, you should grab the spade/shovel outside of the hut to dig the grave. Head outside then look to the left and you'll see a body lying near the garden. To the left of the body is a spade lying against a post. Grab the spade as you will need it to bury the grave.

Pick up the body and head towards the stream


Now that the spade is in your inventory, head over to the body. Before picking it up, hold the 'F' key to loot it for any goodies. Then, hold the 'E' key to pick up the body. Head immediately out of the gate that surrounds the house and down towards the stream. 


Dig the grave and bury the body


Once you reach the stream, you'll see soft ground under your feet in the surrounding area. Put the body down then hit the 'E' key, which will automatically dig up a grave. Go back to the body and hold the 'E' key to pick it back up, then interact with the freshly dug grave by hitting the 'E' key. After a few seconds, the body will be buried and this optional side quest will be complete.


Head back southwest to the Herbalist's hut and interact with the wash tub outside the hut to wash yourself clean of the stench. With this optional quest done, you're now ready to find the Sage and Chamomile and complete the Fortuna quest in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2!

What does Saviour Schnapps do?


In Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, consuming Saviour Schnapps is how you save the game. While you can "quick save" at any time by going into the menu and choosing to save and exit, this is only meant to serve as an option if you are simply looking to exit the game. Your save will be created exactly where you exited the game, and once you continue the game, you'll be loaded in the same spot and the save will be deleted. The game also creates a save any time you sleep in a bed that you have permission to use.

Ah well!

With last month's Nintendo Switch 2 reveal, Nintendo teased something we'd all been waiting for (well, following weeks of leaks) — a potential 'mouse' mode. A little sneak peek at the optical laser, the Joy-Con swiftly rolling along a surface like a mouse.
There are a few obvious candidates for games that'd work wonders with a mouse controller, but the most apparent is next week's new release, Sid Meier's Civilization VII. So trust the folks over at IGN to ask developer Firaxis about its thoughts on the potential feature in an interview.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We typically only get to hear the main cast of the original Metal Gear Solid games in one place when we're replaying the classics. Three of the key voice actors are having a bit of a reunion soon, however, thanks to a new Metroidvania called SteamDolls: Order of Chaos.


Appropriately enough, this one is billed as a stealth-action platformer, so we're still technically on a stealth mission. This particular mission is now set to enter Early Access on February 11. The main cast in the latest from French-Belgian studio The Shady Gentleman includes David Hayter as The Whisper alongside Christopher Randolph and Jennifer Hale. Anyone nostalgic for the staccato burst of a patrolling exclamation point will recognize those names as the respective voices behind Solid Snake, Otacon, and Naomi Hunter.


You can hear how their voices sound in the context of the gritty, shadowed world of SteamDolls in the new release date trailer below.




The Shady Gentleman first cooked SteamDolls up with inspiration from a comic book before taking the title to Kickstarter. Its campaign ended back in July 2020 with €94,828 pledged of a €30,000 goal, and the team originally had a projected delivery of May 2021. That didn't happen, but hopefully, the wait will have been worth it once it drops in a matter of days.


According to the announcement, players who dive into Early Access can expect to play through six chapters of the game. That adds up to around five to seven hours of content, and the devs are hoping to use the feedback from this period to further refine everything for the eventual 1.0 launch. A free demo is still available, too, so you can hop in and hear that gravelly Hayter tone you know and love right now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Like many Roblox games, Jujutsu Odyssey drops you into the world, barely explains how it works, and probably laughs as you die to the first low-level mobs. Well, no more. We went through the grueling tutorials and mastered the controls, and we're here to help new players like you. In this guide, we'll tell you how the controls work so you can get on with actually playing Jujutsu Odyssey.

If you're on PC, the first thing you should do is learn where the Shiftlock keybind is (it's the Ctrl key). Once you do that, the rest of the controls are mostly usual. One thing that you absolutely need to master in this game is blocks, evasion, and dodges (dashing). We're not kidding; if you don't block or dodge in …]]></summary>

Developer G.Rev may not be all that familiar to those who weren’t fully immersed in the shoot-'em-up scene of the early noughties. A boutique independent, it was assembled by former Taito employees who previously contributed to the likes of RayStorm and G-Darius. G.Rev’s most famous work, and the one that put it on the map, is Border Down: a wonderfully original 2003 shooting game for Sega’s Naomi arcade hardware and Dreamcast console. It was followed in 2006 by Under Defeat, switching from the horizontal to the vertical and trading sci-fi for a grounded militaristic theme.
Not to be confused with that other Dreamcast helicopter shoot 'em up, Psikyo’s Zero Gunner 2, Under Defeat pits pink-haired German soldier girls against the enemy forces of “The Union”. While any real-world similarities are dispelled by impossibly giant gunships torn from the pages of anime fiction, one of Under Defeat’s more interesting aspects is how hard-boiled it feels.

The concept of vampires has been around for thousands of years. The first known written reference to them dates back to 1,047 AD, and the idea of blood-sucking monsters has gone on to inspire writers for generations.

Atari has announced that the 1976 brick-breaking arcade classic Breakout is making a comeback. Breakout Beyond is being developed by Runner3 team Choice Provisions and sees the classic's vertical orientation getting flipped on its side.
As you can see in the reveal trailer above, the Pong-like paddles now slide up and down the left side of the screen (as opposed to the bottom in the original) and the screen scrolls right to the goal. Breaking bricks is still a big part of the score-chasing game, but it seems that Choice Provisions has made things a little spicier with scrolling and modern pyrotechnics, as well as some two-player co-op.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The sequel to 2018's Kingdom Come: Deliverance – conveniently called Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 – will be dropping today. Now, it's been a few years since the first game, so what if you've forgotten the story? Or, what if, like me, you're not familiar with the original?


Well, fear not. Developer Warhorse Studios has evidently taken that into account by providing a handy Story Recap. Whether you're new to the series or just need a reminder, the below 10-minute video will bring you up to speed, just in time for the sequel.




You'll be taken all the way back to the events of the first Kingdom Come: Deliverance, which followed Henry on a quest to avenge the murder of his father. We get to see him join the service of Lord Radzig Kobyla, as he seeks to retrieve his father's sword while fighting in the resistance.


The deliverance of plot


According to Steam, Deliverance 2 is scheduled to release in just a few hours. The sequel follows on directly from the first game, which will see you take on the role of Henry once more, as he, again, embarks on a "journey of epic proportions."


The Story Recap, despite being 10 minutes long, is actually a really handy way to learn all you need to know before diving into the new release. I must admit, having not played Kingdom Come: Deliverance, I find it quite useful – and refreshing – that Warhorse Studios has seen to make sure nobody has to go into the sequel blind.


It also answers the question I had hanging above me about whether you needed to play the first game in the series in order to enjoy this one. If anything, having the story recapped for me in a convenient video format only makes me want to play Deliverance 2 more. The last time I saw a developer doing something like this was for Deus Ex: Mankind Divided. But maybe I've not been paying enough attention to sequels recently.

Terry Cavanagh, also the maker of VVVVVV and Dicey Dungeons, is releasing a collection of his freeware bits and bobs on Steam next week, called simply Terry's Other Games. Looking at the games included, it summons a nostalgic giggle just to see just how many of Terry's short games have been intriguing enough to grab the eye of an RPS writer over the years. I mean it literally. One game is called Grab Them By The Eyes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Palworld is a game that took the beginning of 2024 by storm, breaking records on Steam and amassing over two million concurrent users at its peak. Because of its major success on its initial release, Palworld was eventually released on other platforms.


That being said, here are all the platforms Palworld is on, along with speculations and possibilities of making it to even more platforms.


All platforms Palworld is on currently


Right now, Palworld is currently on Xbox One, Xbox Series X and S, PlayStation 5, PC, and soon on Mac OS. 


At its initial launch in early access on January 19, 2024, Palworld was only available via Microsoft platforms (Xbox One, Series consoles, and PC). It was also an Xbox Game Pass day one exclusive, boasting very high player counts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It feels like the announcement of the Nintendo Switch 2 was a long time coming. We've been anticipating it for a few years now, especially with the OG Switch now very much reaching the end of its lifecycle.


In fact, sales of the hybrid console suggest everyone's on tenterhooks, just waiting for the arrival of the Switch 2. In a recent financial report, Nintendo said that sales have decreased once more, with net profits down by 31.4% year-on-year.




A further statement in the report says that sales from the company's "game console business decreased by 31.7% year-on-year to 895.5 billion yen." Nintendo even saw a decrease in "mobile and IP related income," which is being blamed on a decrease in sales on the likes of The Super Mario Bros. Movie that was released in April 2023.


Switching over


Despite even sales of the Nintendo Switch OLED edition dropping when compared to the last financial year, it wasn't all bad news. Sure, sales of Nintendo first-party games also dipped somewhat, but the likes of Super Mario Jamboree and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe have now sold 6.17 million and 5.38 million units, respectively.


In fact, according to the report, Jamboree's "cumulative global sell-through" exceeded 5.6 million copies within the first eleven weeks of its release. This means it surpassed the "pace of sales" when compared to other Switch games like Super Mario Party and Mario Party Superstars.


However, the decline in sales overall won't come as a great surprise to many. It seems fairly clear that the gaming industry is just now waiting for the release of the Switch 2.


Nintendo announced the follow-up system recently, but we don't have a release date for it yet. We've been told it's coming sometime this year and that more details are to follow at the next Nintendo Direct, which is scheduled for April. No doubt, sales of the original Switch are only going to decline as we go forward.

Nintendo has lowered sales forecasts for Switch hardware sales for the second time in a row with the publication of its Q3 results for FY2024/5.
With a 30.6% year-on-year drop in console sales across the Switch range, the platform holder now forecasts 11 million unit sales for the year ending March 31st 2025. For comparison, that's down 1.5 million on its forecast back in November, which had already been cut from 13.5 million.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Peter Akemann - co-founder of Call Of Duty's Treyarch and recent president of The Walking Dead: Saints & Sinners studio Skydance Interactive - has pleaded guilty to crashing a drone into a firefighting plane assisting with the recent LA wildfires. The crash, which grounded the plane by damaging its left wing, occurred after Akemann ignored temporary drone restrictions in order to survey the Palisades fires before losing control. Thanks, Eurogamer. For first noticing the case, I mean. I'm not blaming Eurogamer for the drone crash. Not this one, anyway.
The drone was traced back to Akemann, who has agreed to plead guilty to one count of unsafe operation of an unmanned aircraft. That's a misdemeanour that usually carries up to one year prison time, but he's "hoping to escape the prison term in exchange for 150 hours of community service in support of wildfire relief and the approximately $65,000 USD it cost to repair the plane," write Eurogamer, as part of a plea agreement.

Above, you'll find the first teaser trailer for 'Lost in Hyrule', an upcoming live-action fan film which has just opened its doors to Rupee donations on Kickstarter (or other, non-Hylian currencies, if you'd rather). According to the campaign page, the story takes place after the events of Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask, offering the filmmaker's take on "the untold conclusion to the Hero of Time’s saga". Mmm, lore.

Venris once told me he mods for around "eight to 12 hours a day", though, so I suppose I shouldn't be surprised that this cult-shepherding roguelite is now available in Steam early access.

Nintendo has released its latest financial data for the third quarter of FY2025 ending on 31st December 2024. As part of that, the company has provided an update to its top ten best-selling Switch games list.
There's no change in the order this time, with each title merely receiving a slight bump in sales figures. That said, we fully expect Pokémon Scarlet and Violet to surpass Pokémon Sword and Shield in the coming weeks and months; there's just 220,000 units separating the two generations at the moment.

"The last carrier bag you’ll ever need," begins the description of this tribute to the plastic bag Disco Elysium's protagonist uses to collect bottles to exchange for cash at Martinet's local off-licence. "Frittte brings reassurance that the bag will serve your everyday needs on the toughest streets."
This nod to people whose main takeaway from Fight Club was how rad Brad Pitt's taste in shirts was is being sold by ZA/UM's collobrative merch store with company Atelier. They've previously put out things like a replica of Kim Kitsuragi's jacket. I'm not going to link them, as a pathetic act of rebellion.
As the man who couldn't afford an ambulance to get the gash on his head sewn up once said, let's try and keep an open mind about this.

While obtaining pre-war nuclear launch codes was a privilege only a few in the world had, the post-apocalyptic wasteland hands out codes as if they were phone numbers.

Seafood Salad Disney Dreamlight Valley ingredients


To create the two-star meal Seafood Salad, you'll need two ingredients. They include:



Any Seafood (Squid, Lobster, etc)


Lettuce



Screenshot by Destructoid


Lettuce is easy to find. You can buy the seeds for 3 Star Coins from Goofy's Stall in the Peaceful Meadow. You may also be lucky and be able to purchase the actual ingredient itself. Thankfully, the seeds don't take long to grow after being planted and watered. The growing process takes just three minutes.


You can use any seafood for this dish. One important thing to note, however, is that fish don't count towards the Seafood Salad. You'll need to catch lobsters, squid, basically anything without fins. Clams, Oysters, and Scallops are the easiest to find as they can be picked up from the sand at Dazzle Beach.


If you want the dish to be more valuable, however, you may want to find Lobsters instead. You can find the crustacean in the Glade of Trust within orange ripples. Use your fishing rod and try to catch the lobster. 


By the way, you should hang out with a valley friend who has the fishing specialty on them. Not only will their friendship level progress, but they have a chance to double your catch, so you can get two lobsters with one cast.


Create the dish


Head to any cooking station within Chez Remy or your house and chuck both ingredients in the pot. You'll then have the Seafood Salad ready to eat. If you have Lobster in your dish, you can sell it at Goofy's Stall for 1,245 Star Coins or eat it for 2,865 Energy.


Have spare lobsters in your bag? You can make an awesome Lobster Roll. It probably won't beat the one I had in Boston though!

We all know that in the year of our lord 2025, the Switch eShop has its fair share of problems. It's slow, it's clunky and it's flooded with games that we'd really rather not have to wade through, but what's it like from the other side? How does the storefront hold up if you're the one trying to sell games on it?
That was a question recently asked by IGN in a new feature that put Nintendo's storefront (and Sony's, Microsoft's and Valve's) under the microscope. Unsurprisingly, the devs are just as tired of it as we all are.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Ivan Ilic Future Stars SBC is now live in EA FC 25, and you can complete the challenge to unlock a special card.


This is the first time Ilic has received a special card in this year's Ultimate Team. The SBC is pretty cheap, but you'll have to complete all the tasks to play with him in the game. Let's take a look at how you can complete the challenge in the cheapest fashion possible and see if he is worth grinding for at all.


EA FC 25 Ivan Ilic Future Stars SBC tasks


The Ivan Ilic Future Stars SBC has two tasks, and here are the requirements.


Task 1 - Serie A



Min. 1 Players from: Serie A TIM


Min. Team Rating: 84



Task 2 - 84-Rated Squad



Min. Team Rating: 84



EA FC 25 Ivan Ilic Future Stars SBC solutions


Here's a set of solutions to complete the latest Future Stars challenge in EA FC 25.


Task 1 - Serie A



Smalling 82


Freigang 83


Russo 85


Daly 85


Romero 84


Dovbyk 84


Palacios 84


Schmidt 82


Sule 82


Stones 85


Dzeko 82



Task 2 - 84-Rated Squad



Smalling 82


Freigang 83


Russo 85


Daly 85


Romero 84


Dovbyk 84


Palacios 84


Schmidt 82


Sule 82


Stones 85


Dzeko 82



You're not going to get a top-tier midfielder by completing the SBC, but you have to spend less than 40,000 coins worth of fodder. Additionally, the card is likely to be part of a future evolution pretty soon. The base stats are pretty decent, and he has three different roles++.


There are very few downsides to this Ilic item, which offers Anticipate+, Incisive Pass, Long Pass, Intercept, and Technical. It's a bargain SBC that can also be an excellent addition for Ultimate Team beginners. With a great evolution shortly, the card can become a great fit in many Ultimate Team squads.

We're all here, playing the waiting game as Nintendo assembles its April Direct and reveals more juicy details about Switch 2. Well, we hope; it feels like we've been in the realms of rumour and speculation for a good half-decade and after the first trailer we've got our fingers crossed for a real mother of a blow-out come 2nd April.
Until then, though? Thoughts, feelings, ideas, dreams (and possibly some more leaks) — that's what we've got. That new button previously rumoured for the right Joy-Con is one of few things we can confirm from the reveal, and it's not even a 'C' button anymore - at least it doesn't have the letter imprinted on the top.

A new entry in the Civilization franchise is due to drop later this month on 11th February 2025, but as of yet, we're unable to provide our full thoughts on Sid Meier's Civilization VII on Switch.
Thankfully, a bunch of reviews have gone live at the time of writing, and although they seem to be strictly limited to the PC version of the game, we'll at least be able to get a flavour of the general consensus, even if we don't yet have a view of the game's performance on consoles just yet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Apple Cider Glazed Salmon Disney Dreamlight Valley recipe is a tantalizing meal for any of your Disney friends like Minnie or Goofy. This three-star dish can be created from ingredients you can find in the original valley, no DLC is needed.


Apple Cider Glazed Salmon Disney Dreamlight Valley ingredients


To create Apple Cider Glazed Salmon, you'll need the following ingredients:



Salmon


Apple


Sugarcane



Screenshot by Destructoid


You can fish for Salmon in the Sunlit Plateau or the Frosted Heights. If you have some of the DLC, you can also catch it from The Grasslands or The Promenade. They are caught from white ripples in the water as they are a common fish to obtain. Bring a friend from the valley who has the fishing specialty attached to them. For example, I had Mirabel with me. Catching fish with a person with this specialty increases their friendship level and gives you a chance to double your catch.


Apples can be picked from trees in the Plaza. There is one tree that's right next to my house in the game, making this fruit easy to grab. 


Lastly, Sugarcane seeds can be bought from Goofy in Dazzle Beach. He sells them for 5 Star Coins each. They'll take seven minutes to grow once you've planted and watered them.


Let's bring this dish together


Now you have all of the ingredients, you can now bring them together in any cooking station. Head to your home or Chez Remy (Remy's restaurant, which also sells Butter, Eggs, and more). Throw all three ingredients into the pot, and you'll have the Apple Cider Glazed Salmon ready to serve. C'est magnifique! 


You can sell the Apple Cider Glazed Salmon for 271 Star Coins or eat it for 1,572 Energy. It may also be a dish that a villager requests at Chez Remy. If you give it to them, their friendship level rises significantly. If you keep cooking three-star dishes, this will contribute to your Dreamlight tasks.

Yet, there's no denying the fact that the fancy new Heresy trailer is every bit as cool as Destiny's very best showpieces. 


Seriously, though, Destiny 2: Heresy's launch trailer is an impressive piece of marketing kit. It looks stunning, to begin with, and even if you're a total newcomer to the series, the setup is quite obvious. For the veterans among us, hearing Oryx, the Taken King, speak again is awesome. Somewhat curious, too, as we've been told time and again that Oryx had been killed for good, never to return again. So much for that, eh?




Jump straight into Destiny 2: Heresy on February 4 to help (?) Oryx, somehow

What if your controller could sense your next move? That's hardly science fiction—after all, rollback netcode is used in many leading fighting games to do just that—but a patent has been spotted by Tom's Guide and Game Rant which hints that Nintendo could look to include it in Switch 2 at a hardware level.
The patent was filed by the Japanese company in August 2024 and published on January 23rd of this year. It appears to be a system that tracks button presses and directional movements with the goal of predicting the next possible input sequence.

She greets him like a nobleman. I have Henry push back. He's a blacksmith's son. He might have some blue blood care of his biological father, but he grew up in the soot and clamour of the forge. The girl nervously insists, however: Henry must be from the upper crust, or he wouldn't have been welcomed and feasted by the lord of the estate. He wouldn't be lying in his very own chamber with its very own hole for shitting in - and in any case, it's more than her job's worth to treat him otherwise. In a timid, not quite spiteful show of reverse class policing, she refuses to end the dialogue until she's dismissed in a manner befitting her station.

Resident Evil 4, Fallout 3, Gears Of War - all bleary examples of a grubby visual style. This peaked in Clive Barker's Jericho, a shooter so desaturated it felt like the colour settings on your monitor were banjaxed. I have heard this called "the piss filter" and generally lamented in industry circles. But it was always a puposeful choice, intended to add some grittiness to the world. And there's at least one developer who is reviving "smeared dirt" as an art direction. As Time Surrenders is a very brown stealth game that takes a lot of inspiration from Metal Gear Solid V.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nvidia DLSS 4 has launched under not-terribly-happy circumstances. It’s a mostly AI-powered technology at a time when mistrust in artificial intelligence, fuelled by underbaked applications and anti-creative policies, is at all-time high – not to mention how the new GeForce GPUs it’s released alongside, the RTX 5080 and RTX 5090, have immediately entered 2020-style stock shortage purgatory.
However, having tried it out in a few different games, I suspect time will prove kinder to DLSS 4 than the RTX 50 series launch has been. It is, in fact, a rather nifty collection of upscaling improvements that can help out older graphics cards as readily as the very newest, while building on DLSS 3’s frame generation tool with Multi Frame Generation (MFG) to send visual smoothness skyrocketing. If you care even the slightest iota for how your PC performs in modern games, DLSS 4 demands your attention.
Here, then, I’ll break down DLSS 4’s various tricks and components, looking at how they really affect performance – and whether it’s worth upgrading your rig to maximise compatibility with it.

That dedication continues in the all-new Sniper Elite: Resistance, which puts you in the boots of an entirely new protagonist and sends you off to pop Nazi noggins.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The post-launch update and DLC schedule for Sid Meier's Civilization VII slightly discombobulates me, because the image above is weirdly reminiscent of Civ 7's own historical Age progression screens. But that uncanny similarity also pleases me, because I can now do the intro joke "all roadmaps lead to Rome".* 


In case you missed it, the new 4X strategy jobbo is out 11th February. Developers Firaxis have now sketched out plans for updating it, which extend from the usual balancing and bug fixes to a variety of new map types, possible multiplayer features and Age settings.

That was interesting for showing the benefits of Zen 5's full 512-bit data path support compared to the "double pumped" approach with Zen 4 or optionally used via a BIOS option on Zen 5. AVX-512 continues to prove to be very performant and power efficient with AMD Zen 5 processors unlike with the early generations of AVX-512 on Intel processors. Here is a fresh look at the AVX-512 performance on a Supermicro server with an AMD EPYC 9655 processor.]]></summary>

Its approach to hooks, lines, and sinkers will combine the fishing from Animal Crossing, Sega Bass Fishing, and Webfishing, says developer The Water Museum in a post on Bluesky. It may have a splash of Dredge when it comes to inventory management too. Oh, also, a strange man might imply you are "disappointing someone". Nothing to worry about. And the ocean may or may not turn completely red. These decisions have not been finalised. Everything is okay. It is possible the fish are safe to eat.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hidden away on NASA's Golden Record, an interstellar archive of music, image and sound, there is a recording of a poem by Charles Baudelaire, Élévation, which describes the astral ascent of the soul. Well, part of a poem. Both to free up room on the disc and perhaps, to edit out "the vast sorrows and all the vexations" of the second half, only the first two stanzas appear. The recording in fact ends halfway through a line, which conjures up an intriguing problem for the listener, inasmuch as the thwarted rhyme scheme reveals that the piece is incomplete. A poetically-minded alien might be tempted to fill in the gap. A fancier alien who took a module in postmodernism might hail the poetics of the fragment. A resolutely practical alien who thinks poetry is for losers might read the whole thing, instead, as a set of incoherent navigational prompts, made up of loose prepositions - au-dessus, au-dessus, par delà, par delà.

Yes, I'm well aware that "2.5D" and "Soulsvania" are nonsense words, woven by pestilent market forces. Samuel Johnson is turning in his grave, I expect. He has risen from his grave and equipped himself with an ironbound dictionary and is even now making his way through the layers of the English language, hellbent on slaughtering every 'vania yet coined.
But never mind Samuel. Oversized rodents and spiders aside, Mandragora is notable for being written by Brian Mitsoda, writer of the original Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines and the former narrative lead for its sequel at Hardsuit Labs, which lives on in the hands of The Chinese Room. Primal have just announced a release date - 17th April. Here's a trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Don't get too comfortable. As an RPG that puts you in the synthetic boots of an escaped robo-person, Citizen Sleeper 2 often has you on the run. It's a crunchy, dicey machine of vibrant world-building that sometimes forgets itself in wandering prose. A compelling universe to sail through, with more habitats and hovels than its predecessor, more stations and stellar gateways. It can't - for me - escape the dense gravity of the first game's compact storytelling and novel character building, no matter how often it funnels you from one space caper to the next. But it has a good time trying.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bioware released a statement yesterday. It talked of "turning towards the future". It dreamed of "a more agile, focused studio". Nowhere in the post did the word "layoffs" appear. But this is what the post was actually about. The closest it got to addressing the facts of what happened to an unspecified number of workers is the phrase: "we don’t require support from the full studio." 
It's one of the most disingenuous announcements of job cuts in a recent and plentiful history of job cuts. A weirdly impressive feat from BioWare, considering the last two or three years have seen some spectacular verbal gymnastics from games companies when it comes to shitcanning people. Let's take a look at some of our "favourite" mealy-mouthed press releases in which people have their jobs poetically "sunsetted" rather than, say, dropkicked out the window.

A number of Dragon Age: The Veilguard staff are leaving the celebrated RPG company in the course of plans to become "a more agile, focused studio", as BioWare move ahead with the next Mass Effect game. Posting on Bluesky, senior systems designer Michelle Flamm, producer Jen Cheverie, editor Karin West-Weekes, lead writer Trick Weekes and narrative designer Ryan Cormier have all announced that they're looking for work.


All of which feels like it warrants a mention in general manager Gary McKay's recent blog about BioWare's future, but he comments only that they're "taking the opportunity to reimagine" how BioWare operate between projects, and "have worked diligently over the past few months to match many of our colleagues with other teams at EA that had open roles that were a strong fit." Which is a very slippery way to say that you're making a load of people redundant.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mere hours before it’s January 30th release – wait, that’s today! – Sony have finally spilled the beans on system requirements for Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, as well as the eye-blistering, GPU-rending special features that more powerful rigs can support. Happily, all these ray tracing and frame generation accoutrements seemingly won’t preclude Spidey 2 from working on older, slower PCs as well, as the minimum specs are surprisingly reasonable.
Granted, they’re only rated for 30fps at a lowly 720p, and you’ll still need to find a honking 140GB of SSD space, but the basic GPU and CPU requirements aren’t too lofty at all. The likes of an RTX 3060 for 60fps/1080p are quite reasonable as well, though you’re staring down the barrel of Nvidia’s pricey RTX 4080 and RTX 4090 cards for high-rez ray tracing.

"An account for PlayStation Network will become optional for these titles on PC," said PlayStation in a short and quiet blog post that includes the upcoming PC release for Spider-Man 2, and The Last Of Us Part II. It's been eight months since PlayStation provoked mass annoyance among PC players by making a PSN account mandatory to play Helldivers 2, and later Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered. They soon walked back the decision for Helldivers 2 after a rough review-bombing but the company didn't seem to fully take the hint. It looks like they've now conceded that, yes, the obligatory sign-up was an unpopular move.

Zoe Lofgren introduced the Foreign Anti-Digital Piracy Act earlier today. Should it become law, FAPDA would allow rightsholders to obtain site blocking orders targeted at verified pirate sites, presumably run by foreign operators. The blocking orders would apply to both ISPs and DNS resolvers. The latter is a novelty.

"Look at my spaceship go," you say to yourself, "look how fast it crashes into that other, smaller ship." Building your own galactic snowpiercer from scratch in Space Engineers 2 will bring a smile to anyone who once revelled in clicking together Lego podracers and bashing them into one another on the living room carpet with a violence eight-year-olds should not yet have mental access to. That said, this is the precise extent of the things you can do in the game so far. Build 'n' crash. Every feature fits in this opening paragraph. There's good reason to trust the developers' ability to deliver the rest of this crafting and survival game. But right now, it's all core, no loop.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Open world spec op gun-brandisher Phantom Line takes place during a paranormal crisis of such intensity that the outbreak of nuclear war gets relegated to bullet point five on the latest press email. Atomic apocalypse? Ehhh. That's a roadside picnic compared to what S.T.A.L.K.S this alternately Lynchian and Tarkovskian battlefield. You'll wish you'd been dusted by nuclear fire when you're being torn open by some kind of demon puppet in a labyrinth of red curtains.


If you do get torn open by a demon puppet, the good news is that players have a range of artificial bodies to choose from. Among Phantom Line's headline features is the HUSK system, which lets you switch between members of your squad right in the middle of combat. Unless, presumably, the body in question is already occupied by one of your co-op partners. If all this sounds appealing, the even-gooder news is that there's now a demo available via the developer Discord.

You also can’t miss its regular performance hiccups, which most often manifest as little but frequent stutters that occur as you’re moseying around its poorly planet. 
Or can you? News comes via Nic himself that modder FrancisLouis, whose previous works include performance-enhancing rejigs of various games (and one that turns the Silent Hill 2 remake’s pipe weapon into a rigid, A-posing wife), has produced Fantasy Optimizer: an overhaul of how FF7 Rebirth handles shaders and streamed visuals. Both Nic and myself have tried it out on our respective rigs, and it works! Mostly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Has any genus of graphics card been as dramatically storied as the GeForce XX80s? The RTX 3080 was a thing of beauty, only to be tarnished by the worst wheeler-dealing spree (and crypto mining misappropriation) in PC component history. Then the RTX 4080 rocked up with its laughable £1269 / $1199 price tag, a miscalculation so severe that the RTX 4080 Super looked good – despite hardly being any faster – simply for not repeating it. For the new RTX 5080’s sake, you almost want it to be boring.
It isn’t. But then, neither is it a blood-boiler like the RTX 4080, nor a largely aspirational show-off piece like the RTX 5090. By maintaining the 4080 Super’s course correction on price while tooling up on compelling DLSS 4 improvements, the RTX 5080 is an agreeable GPU from the off. Particularly, if you’ve got the 4K monitor to take full advantage of it.

Dazzling and exhausting. What was once a relatively (and to some extent unintentionally) lean procgen exploration sim has swelled into a game of mechs, fishing, fickle weather systems, intricate asteroid engagements, starbases, nautiloids and capes. It is far bigger than it reasonably needs to be, and it's only getting more and more, er, infinite.

Which is to say, somebody's finally made a video game version of Hex, the sentient glass hive from Terry Pratchett's Unseen University. In spooky automation-driven strategy sim Microtopia, you manage a swarm of what could either be ants who've been to the ripperdoc, or PC components who've grown legs and antennae. Your goal is to expand an insect colony that is also a motherboard, where glittering pheromone trails double as silicon circuits.
The developers Cordyceps Collective have just announced a release date - February 18th - and what's this, there's a demo as well? Catch the trailer below.

You may or may not find all that "soothing" - I won't judge. I will only repeat Nic's observation from the Maw that Sniper At Work look "a bit like Commandos, a bit like Hitman", which I would translate to "my comrade in PC gaming, if historic audience trends are any indication you shall do well here".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A Nintendo lawsuit filed last November targeted video gamer Jesse Keighin, aka EveryGameGuru. Given the scope of the allegations, narrowly focused on a single defendant, the action seems unusually punitive. Yet if the plan was to push Keighin into a corner, the Colorado resident hasn't read the script. Allegations of destruction of evidence, obstructing service, and abuse of Nintendo's legal team, combine to make a dire situation even worse. But not for Nintendo.

I am also thankful that my tamagotchi did not itself have a tamagotchi, because the only life principle I ever taught my tamagotchi was neglect. This is also the reason I may never play the reportedly pretty decent virtual pet game Yoke Heroes: A Long Tamago, whose developers 14 Hours Productions are defying God and Man by developing another virtual pet sim inside it.

E-Day itself is aiming to have a pronounced horror slant, with the 'Emergence Day' of the title referring to the insectoid Locust's first visit above ground.

It's sort of Journey for plague doctors, or possibly The Hobbit: Cosmodick Turpin Edition. I enjoy feeling the weight of those distant peaks upon my brain and eyeballs, but it's nice to fire up Kingdoms, the new free DD2 game mode that's launched just today, and have a choice of disasters to trundle toward.  


Over here is an inn being overrun by slathering beastmen. Over there is another, safer inn, but it's inconveniently perched behind a nest of tentacular cultists. In the middle there is you, with the customary DD party of half-dead, half-mad adventurers, equipped with an exciting smorgasbord of sharp edges, cursed artefacts, phobias and diseases. Let us proceed laughing and wailing to the launch trailer.

It's a single-button affair, having you navigate levels by alternating a pivot-point on a shape I don't know the name of so I'm just going to call a spinny stick.
There are moving background elements in some stages - in others, you make your own pace. Except I can't really make my own pace, can I Bauhaus Bonk? Because the swing soundtrack makes me feel like a plodding buffoon if I'm not responding with appropriate gusto. This is entrapment, game. I am devilishly compelled by swing, like a Reefer Madness extra.

Something to ponder on, perhaps, as we behold the Steam Brick. As reported by PC Gamer, one Crastinator-pro has documented their journey to transform the Steam Deck into a controller-less, screen-less creature of ineffable bricktitude. Why? Because the Deck didn't fit in their backpack.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A performance and settings guide for a ropey PC port of a Final Fantasy game? Sweet, I haven’t done one of these in four whole months. In fairness to Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, which Nic says can be great as a game per se, it does make some effort at settling into Windows. It has rebindable M+K controls. It has DLSS. It has generally more consistent framerates than FFXVI, which could bait you in with silky visuals before grabbing your head and shoving it into the cold ice bath of sub-30fps.
Yet it also steps back from that game on its supported tech, while raising its hardware requirements so far above Final Fantasy 7 Remake that it won’t even launch on a lot of older graphics cards. Even so, hitching and microstuttering issues from FF7 Remake return once more, along with plenty of other signs that this PC version didn’t get the love that a lot of other erstwhile PlayStation exclusives – like Horizon Forbidden West or God of War Ragnarök – did for their ports.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you turn 33 years old in the next couple of months then, sorry, you are dead. I don't make the rules, that's just how Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 explains the lack of elders in its very French yet very JRPG world. The fantasy game will see you journey across a dangerous landscape to stop the mad "paintress" who's magically culling humanity at younger and younger ages every year. We've been keeping a weary middle-aged eye on its development, and yesterday it got a release date. It's too late for most of us in the RPS treehouse. But watch the trailer for yourself, maybe you'll make it.

A new trailer for action adventure game South Of Midnight sees players battering monsters from the folklore of the US' Deep South. It shows hero Hazel arguing with her mum before a supernatural hurricane cuts off the family drama and sends Hazel wandering the swamps to encounter giant alligators, giant fish, giant dolls, and giant people. Maybe Hazel is just very small. Either way, it also dangles an important morsel in front of our snapping jaws: a release date. Come see.

It's out right now on Steam and Microsoft's Game Pass service. I'd say it has materialised from the darkness like a ninja, but there are a lot of ninjas in circulation at the minute, and my analogy-jitsu gauge is running dry. So instead, I'm going to say that it has materialised from the darkness like a resurfacing duck, its beak stuffed with pond vegetation. The pond vegetation, here, stands for "tweaks to the weapons upgrade system". Here's a trailer.

"The music, the amazing variety in terrain and units, the sheer quantity of words bringing to life every last quest, minor faction, creature, and environmental anomaly," breathed a reverential Ollie in 2023. "It's a simply splendid game." Like somebody commenting on the sturdiness of an original Picasso's frame, I will only add that it now runs pretty comfortably on the current least expensive Dell Thinkpad.
Why in Meier's name would Sega choose to sell off the studio behind such a worldly wonder? The answer is lost in time (it's through that link, there), but fortunately, Amplitude endure as an independent - and they've just announced Endless Legend 2 with no less than Hooded Horse as publisher. Here's the announcement trailer.

Fortunately, we had a roundtable interview afterward with executive producer Marty Stratton and game director Hugo Martin. Sweet, job-justifying details!

Between its multiple release date delays in response to Star Wars Outlaws not selling as well as Ubisoft would've liked, and Ubi potentially being bought by Tencent as they clamour for help, there's a sense that Shadows needs to deliver not only a great game, but corporate redemption.
I've now played Shadows for four hours, having dipped into a bit of prologue action, some open world exploration, and a questline as both the hulking Yasuke and the lithe Naoe. Have Ubi delivered? I think there's a strong chance. What I played was a lot of comforting Creeding, carried along by a gorgeous interpretation of Edo Japan, and some subtle tweaks to up stealth stakes. Although I do think the two protagonists are a split personality that doesn't quite work for me.

Here is a compact selection of ski slopes, each one yodeling the promise of my smooth and exhilarating descent over fresh powder. But wait, someone has littered this Ski Sunday with obstacles, forcing me to run a gauntlet of trees, rocks and rivers. I am thrust headlong into each of these obstacles a dozen times before my withered synapses and tired bones internalise these arboreal teachings and I make it safely to the bottom.

As in life, there is joy to be found in this journey precisely because it is hard. Unlike in life, the camera is often facing backwards while you do it.

Dick’s cheese dreams. At least two of those points will, I’m sure, send the average graphics card shopper running, especially at a time when even game developers are growing suspicious of generative AI and its many-thumbed, robot-voiced nostrums.
Yet while there’s not much to be done about the RTX 5090 costing at minimum £1939 / $1999, hundreds more than the infamously spenny RTX 4090, its suite of more purely performance-focused artificial intelligence tools is – dare I say it – quite neat. These range from Multi Frame Generation (MFG), which is basically DLSS 3 frame gen but up to twice as fast, to DLSS 4’s general upscaling enhancements and even the ability to apply newer DLSS versions to older games. All this will come to the rest of the RTX 50 series as well, with some trickling down to the enter RTX range, so maybe the RTX 5090 is best understood not as a practical GPU purchase in itself but as a Picadilly Square-filling advert for its more affordable siblings can do.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a dramatic turn of events, the Royal Shakespeare Company have finally acknowledged that video games are cool and theatre simply does not have enough buttons. They are partnering with a game studio to create a playable adaptation of Macbeth from the point of view of someone examining Lady Macbeth's computer for dirt. Lili looks a lot like the interactive drama popularised by Sam Barlow's Her Story and Telling Lies. Except this has the added twist of being set in contemporary Iran. The game "will see Macbeth’s witches reimagined as hackers, with surveillance cameras and cyber-infiltration putting the player at the heart of the story..." Witchy hackers? I'm in.

Nvidia reckon that won’t be an issue with for the imminent RTX 5090 and RTX 5080, though, even with the former’s drastically increased 575W power limit.

The decision to call it quits follows a bust-up within the development team, though this isn't, apparently, why they pulled the plug. Thorson and programmer Noel Berry have found making something "bigger and better" than Celeste exhausting, and have decided to work on smaller projects in future.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I can't get out. I'm trapped in a tractor full of beer and spare tires. I haven't taken a shower in days and a fly has gotten into the cab, buzzing around my ears, anticipating the feast that will come from my sweaty summer death. I just spent nearly an hour driving this tractor to the shop, buying car parts, and rumbling back in the dark. I took my eyes off the road for two seconds to turn on the headlights. It was a mistake. The road curved sharply and I went off a steep bank, tipping my tractor on its side. The door is stuck, the tractor's wheels spin helplessly. There is no recovering from this. I restart the game for the third or fourth time, not knowing whether to laugh or sob.
My Summer Car is as hardcore as they come. It does not simply throw you in at the deep end. It ties you up in a cloth sack with 50 kg of lug nuts and dumps you in the Baltic sea. "Sink or swim!" yells this game at you, but in Finnish, so even that you cannot understand. To a certain kind of person, this is an act of love.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This review contains some story spoilers for the original FF7 and subsequently some elements of Rebirth, but doesn't spoil how Rebirth ultimately reinterprets these elements. 
I argued with myself for several weeks in university about whether to go to a seminar discussing T.S. Eliot's The Love Song Of J. Alfred Prufrock. The poem meant enough to me that I didn't want to dissect it with a class. I wanted to keep for myself. I went in the end, and though I hesitated, I talked because I had things to say. It didn't kill the poem for me, but it does have a slightly awkward gait now, having never quite recovered from the incisions.
I now have to etherise Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth. Cait Sith is splayed upon a table. It's all scalpels, forceps, and oversized novelty dice. It's a strange way to treat art you love. The feeling I remember most from Rebirth on release is how grateful I felt to be alive to play it. Acute, active awareness of my own mortality with thoughts like "it would be properly shit if I died right now because I'd really like to see how this pans out". A personal 'never kill yourself' moment months before the meme gave voice, as the best often do, to an obscure and precious feeling.
An RPG where your character sometimes knocks on doors before opening them? What a time to be alive.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Many moons ago in the Before Times, a mysterious cataclysm scattered a number of seasoned BioWare developers across the face of heaven. The developers fell upon the mortal planes like comets. Where each landed, a game development studio took root. Inflexion Games. Summerfall Studios. Humanoid Origin. Worlds Untold. Archetype Entertainment.
Summerfall appear to be prospering, but many of the studios founded by former BioWare devs have experienced hard times. In particular, Humanoid Origin and Worlds Untold have respectively closed and "paused operations" without releasing a single game. I'm raising a tentatively congratulatory glass, then, to Yellow Brick Games, a studio founded by former Dragon Age director Mike Laidlaw. The company's debut game Eternal Strands will release on 28th January, and there's now a PC demo.

I wrote about it last year, but that was an older demo build. Things were different then, but the core of this minimalist city builder strategy remains: you'll need to actively train your kingly eyes on your feckless underlings if you want them to do any work. Don't watch the wheat fields, no food. Don't watch the barracks, no knights. You'll need those knights to defend from attacks too. Do you see how it all connects?! Do you?! Please, do your research.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Debate continues to rage on the internetworks about whether premium video games, and especially the ones with the largest budgets, need to have higher price tags. This time, the culprit is Matthew Ball of analyst firm Epyllion, who remarks in a sprawling State Of Videogaming 2025 report that "some gamemakers hope GTA 6 will be priced at $80-$100 [in the USA], breaking the $70 barrier and helping $50 titles to move up to $60, $60 to $70, $70 to $80, etc."
Picked up by VGC, these comments have now been circulated on social media, and have attracted the extremely polarised mixture of responses you're probably expecting. Among those chipping in is Larian's director of publishing Michael Douse, who makes the familiar argument that overall prices for games like GTA aren't necessarily higher today when you factor in economic inflation, while also acknowledging that up-front price alone doesn't explain the industry's recent mass livelihood devastation, and that few people would happily pay that much for a video game - not even Our Lord In Open Worlding GTA.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The relaxing fish catchin' and scratchcard gamblin' of Webfishing proved itself deeply attractive to anyone looking for an easygoing escape. So it makes sense at least one other developer is looking to apply the same lo-fi principles to their own "hangout game". The simply titled Sledding Game looks like a chill afternoon of standing around on mountains with your mates and going for a big slide downhill every now and again. It's still early in development, as you can tell from the trailer below. But you'll be able to embody penguins, frogs, and polar bears as they drink hot cocoa in log cabins and ragdoll into one another willy-nilly. Other cute animals are to be confirmed, but I am putting my money on an dopey-faced ermine.

Of the new strategy game demos I've spotted so far, the one that interests me most is Calyx, in which you are at war with a mass of alien vegetation, which expands toward your base in a blossoming, suffocating avalanche of green moss and purple tendril. It seems a bit raw at the level of controls and performance, but the concept is very promising: basically, imagine if Creeper World 4 were a bit more like Ground Control. Here's a trailer.

Much like an exhausted hunter applying a carving knife to the flanks of a steaming heap of Rathalos, they shall trim and whittle their prize to its essential organs - hmm, actually we never see the concluding butchery in Monster Hunter games, now that I think of it. You just waft your knife around dramatically while the slaughtered quarry peacefully disappears and chunks of dino component materialise in your inventory.

To wit: why have a lantern, asks FPS Mohrta, when you can have a horrible vulture-esque creature called a lantern beast that lives on your head to light up the dark for you? "Found a good'un," I wrote in Slack shortly after playing Mohrta's Steam demo. "It's so rad and strange!". Well, that's the pitch, reader. It's a "nonlinear FPS game blending action, exploration, and light dungeon crawling". Very rad. Very strange. Nom nom.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cyclopean: The Great Abyss appears to have glorious dungeon graphics but I can't say for sure because I can't get torches to work. I think your character is supposed to kindle them automatically when you venture into a dungeon - at which point the view switches, classic Ultima-style, from top-down into first-person. My character never deigns to light a torch, however. Possibly this is because, no matter how many torches I loot or buy from the underworld's infrequent traders, my character page always tells me I have none. Is my character eating them? Are they too afraid to light them and expose what those dungeons contain? Do I need to read the manual properly? Or is it just a bug?

News of the project was pieced together by mp1st from several LinkedIn profiles belonging to former employees of studio Thought Pennies. Different sources alternately describe the project as a “multiplatform, social role-playing game" and a "fantasy live-service RPG", although it's possible these refer to different projects from the same time period.

Mělo to mít nějakou jinou "message" než "když jsi psychopatický gangster, špatně dopadneš"? Ale docela to uteklo. Jednoznačné mínus a nechtěný (zřejmě?) humor tkví ve skutečnosti, že hlavní hrdinka (t.j. žena) pořád vypadá jako nabušený chlap v paruce a během celého filmu to žádné jiné postavě nepřijde divné.
