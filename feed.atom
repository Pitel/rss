        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitmap Books' latest epic packs a punch.
Capcom's Street Fighter has had many rivals over the years, including the likes of Virtua Fighter, Mortal Kombat and Guilty Gear. However, one franchise stands out as the true competitor: SNK's King of Fighters. Since its inception in 1994, the series has offered what many fans consider to be the only legitimate alternative to Capcom's one-on-one offering, and at one point, it was more popular than Street Fighter in Japanese arcades. After something of a barren period for the franchise (and, arguably, the genre in general) King of Fighters is enjoying something of a minor resurgence, which makes the publication of Bitmap Books' The King Of Fighters: The Ultimate History all the more timely.
Weighing in at over 540 pages and packed with interviews, artwork, screenshots and much more besides, The King Of Fighters: The Ultimate History follows in the footsteps of Metal Slug: The Ultimate History and Neo-Geo: A Visual History; all of these books are the result of the publisher's close relationship with SNK, a relationship which has allowed for unprecedented access to the company's vaults – as well as its past and present staff.

You blast through procedurally generated woods and sewers, bursting enemies for cash and channeling your profits into a skill tree that's also your own psyche. It's rad, basically, but its roguelite dusting doesn't quite hit the mark when a literal nightmare is turning into a metaphorical one.

It's no secret at this point that Kanye West wanted to work with Nintendo on a video game idea. The presidential candidate and occasional rapper pitched an idea to the publisher but was ultimately rejected, with Reggie Fils-Aime himself "politely declining" the opportunity to work with Mr. West.
Now, thanks to a story related by Twitch Community Producer Zachary Ryan via Twitter, we now have insight into the initial conversation between Kanye West and industry legend Shigeru Miyamoto at E3 2015. Ryan states that Miyamoto launched into the story during an interview to promote Star Fox Zero the following year after a Nintendo rep brought up the then-recently released Life of Pablo album.

        <updated>2022-05-09T14:15:11.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gotham Knights might feature four-player co-op, if an updated PlayStation Network Store listing for the game is to be believed. 
Gotham Knights, which lets players control either Nightwing, Batgirl, Robin, or Red Hood in a Gotham without its Batman, has marketed co-op as a feature since its reveal back in 2020. However, its co-op only supported up to two players. It seems that developer Warner Bros. Montreal, the studio behind Batman Arkham: Origins, might be looking to bump that number up. That’s because a new PSN listing for Gotham Knights lists the game as having four-player co-op, as reported by PCGamesN. 
As you can see in the screenshot above (taken by Game Informer this morning), PlayStation lists the game as one that “supports up to 4 online players with PS Plus.” It even features the symbol and wording for “4 network players” beside that, further supporting the claim that Gotham Knights might feature four-player online co-op. However, as PCGamesN notes, the description for the game still says Gotham Knights can be experienced “in solo-play or with one other hero,” which sounds a lot like two-player co-op. 
Perhaps Warner Bros. Montreal has a surprise announcement up its sleeve, or maybe it is developing a mode separate from the campaign that supports four-player co-op. Only time will tell. 
For more, check out this Gotham Knights gameplay walkthrough and then watch the latest trailer for Gotham Knights, which highlights the control of the Court of Owls. Read about how Gotham Knights was delayed to October after that.

It feels like an age ago now, but when Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge was announced it triggered excitement among gamers of all ages. For sure, some of the reaction came from players of a certain vintage that remember the original show and the TMNT arcade game, from which this new game draws heavy inspiration. Plenty will also remember console ports and sequels in the '90s. Retro has been 'cool' for a good while now, though, so the love of older titles runs through generations, helping to explain the surge of remasters and retro sequels in the past five years, as well as Digital Eclipse's upcoming Turtles compilation, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection.
In the case of Shredder's Revenge, updates were relatively infrequent through 2021, barring the occasional character reveal, but that's now changed as promotion steps up a gear. Though still a 'Summer' release, it's clearly close to the finish line; we've had a chance to play the same PC demo that made its debut at PAX East recently, and also talk to a couple of key figures behind the game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Salt And Sacrifice is a 2D metroidvania hunt-a-thon that casts you as a condemned prisoner in an imperiled kingdom. Magic is corrupting the land, giving rise to monstrous creatures and ravenous undead, and the source of all of this destruction, Mages, must be hunted and their hearts devoured if the Kingdom is to survive. Like Ska Studios’s previous outing, the game features difficult combat, extensive equipment options, and hulking bosses to slay. But while the scale has increased and the combat and visuals are as slick as ever, there are some growing pains that only just manage to hold the game back from its full potential.
Upon booting the game up, it’s immediately clear that you’re in for a visual treat.The design and detail are just ever so lovely: from the way firelight gives a soft glow to its surroundings in the twilight, to how fog wafts lazily over cobble stairways in a musty dungeon, it’s all just so utterly gorgeous to look at. Ska Studios have always had a recognizable art style – imposing architecture and grungy moppets – but it’s plain to see here that they’ve upped their game in the best possible way. According to the devs, every asset was created from scratch, and that care shows in every frame.

Years have passed since I last played, causing the vague memories to distort into a recollection that’s nothing like reality. In my head, that first arcade game captured the frenetic energy of the TMNT cartoons I’d watch on a Saturday morning. The reality was quite different, with the turtles awkwardly bumbling through Manhattan while occasionally smacking an enemy.
That realisation has never been more apparent than after playing the first two levels of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge, a successor to those early beat ‘em up TMNT arcade games being developed by Tribute Games and published by DotEmu. It captures the aesthetic of those childhood memories and makes them a reality, which is a testament to Tribute Games’ understanding of TMNT as a brand. But it also feels far too familiar, failing to substantially innovate on the original formula.

If you fancy yourself an old-school TMNT fan, then Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge is likely one of your most anticipated games. The upcoming title takes the blueprint of classic brawlers like Turtles in Time and shines it up for an original adventure that feels better than the old games ever did. I should know because I played a demo of Shredder’s Revenge and walked away even more excited for the full release.
The demo let me battle the Foot Clan across the game’s first two levels: the Channel 6 news station and the streets of New York City. I’m now intimately familiar with these stages, given …]]></summary>

We can imagine that one of the most fun things about being a video game composer (except, you know, writing music for a video game) is the variety of projects you'll get to work on. One time you might be writing music for a cyberpunk action-adventure game, then your next project might be a cute and cuddly platformer.
Today, we have Octopath Traveler composer Yasunori Nishiki to thank for a pair of unlikely projects. Most famous for making his solo composer debut on the Square Enix's HD-2D RPG, he has gone on to provide compositions for Kingdom Hearts III and Final Fantasy VII Remake, but he has another credit in his deck that might surprise you.

Remember the Clockwork Pi GameShell? We covered this open source DIY handheld in 2018, mainly because it resembled a Game Boy and could run MAME, Game Boy Advance and NES titles. It raised $290,429 on Kickstarter and we really enjoyed tinkering around with it – so the news that Clockwork Pi was releasing another, similar product came as music to our ears.
Even so, we perhaps weren't prepared for what actually turned up in the post; the DevTerm clearly isn't trying to replicate a Nintendo-made portable or any other handheld games console for that matter; this 'retrofuturistic' design is inspired by the TRS-80 Model 100 from 1983, and boasts dimensions of around 209×159mm (that's not including the Game Boy Printer-like 58mm 200 DPI thermal printer module on the back – yes, it has one of those). It has a full QWERTY keyboard, D-pad, trackball and ultra-wide 6.8" IPS 1280×480 pixel display, with an aspect ratio of 16:6.

Metroid: Other M hasn't has the smoothest of rides since it launched for the Wii back in 2010. Although widely praised for its combat and visuals, heavy criticism was given for Samus's characterisation and the overall narrative. Although the game has earned some positive reprisals from fans in more recent times, it's clear that the game wasn't quite what audiences were looking for after Retro Studio's stellar Metroid Prime trilogy.
Reggie Fils-Aimé has been doing the rounds recently in promotion for his new book, Disrupting the Game (check out our review here) and has spoken about the reception to Metroid: Other M on the Kinda Funny Gamescast.

Square Enix's next big RPG release is the Live A Live remake for Switch this July, an HD-2D remake of the Super Famicom cult classic. In anticipation of the release, Famitsu sat down with the original's director, Takashi Tokita — who went on to direct Parasite Eve and co-direct Chrono Trigger — to find out more about the length of the development process.
In the interview (which has been kindly translated by Nintendo Everything), Tokita revealed that the team started work on the remake "At the beginning of 2019, and it took us three years." Three years isn't a terribly long time for a game to be in development nowadays, so when asked about why the turnaround was a bit quicker than other releases, Tokita brought up the game's HD-2D visuals:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["I didn't want Return to Monkey Island to be just a throwback game".
Last month, the internet was roused from its dreary state by the announcement that Return to Monkey Island was in development and would mark a return to the franchise for its original creator, Ron Gilbert. Better yet, it's slated to release at some point this year (we just don't know if it's coming to Switch yet!).
Fans of Secret of Monkey Island and Monkey Island 2: LeChuck's Revenge have no doubt taken great interest in the art style for Return to Monkey Island; moving away from the original games' pixelated visuals, the new release has taken on a more modernised, abstract art style.

After seeing the game's title screen, a system alert appeared, telling me I wouldn't be able to play due to an online connection error. I knew my Xbox was connecting just fine since I could see all of the online functionality on the home screen. I assumed this alert was a boot-up hiccup – something I experience from time to time when reawakening my console. I reset my Xbox, tried to relaunch Fortnite, and just when it appeared to connect, I was booted out again, now receiving an alert that the person who owns this game needs to log in.
I didn't blink an eye at it. I checked Xbox's Twitter to confirm the outage and ran a support check on the console. …]]></summary>

That Mother 3 never got officially localised and released outside Japan has been a source of sadness and frustration for EarthBound fans in the West since the game launched on Game Boy Advance back in 2006. The sequel to cult classic EarthBound — the SNES entry in the Mother series which sold poorly in the US and didn't see the light of day in Europe until a Wii U and 3DS Virtual Console release — was a very late arrival on GBA. However, backwards compatibility meant that Japanese players entering the WiiDS heydays didn't have to dig out their old handheld to enjoy the final chapter of writer Shigesato Itoi's trilogy.

I didn't have a SNES growing up. I didn't have a NES, either. I had an N64, though, so I'm not totally hopeless. Lately, I've been able to remedy the gaps in my gaming knowledge, since Nintendo's been adding a ton of games that I either missed (because of being a baby) or missed (as in, bemoaned the absence of) to the Nintendo Switch Online service.
But, well, a lot of them haven't aged well — even the ones I remember fondly, whose sharp edges can be filed off by nostalgic forgiveness, like Banjo-Kazooie. Listen, Banjo-Kazooie is a great game, but 25 years of playing constantly refined and perfected platformers make that game feel kinda bad. Sorry.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hearthstone Battlegrounds is but a few days away from a major shakeup. On May 10, Blizzard will be releasing pats 23.2, which includes the significant Rise of the Naga update for Hearthstone's auto battler. With it comes a new hero, Queen Azshara, and a brand new minion keyword called Spellcraft that gives the player temporary spells out of thin air each turn to buff their team of minions. 
Speaking of minions, a new race of creatures will be coming with Rise of the Naga, and it will, of course, be the Naga themselves joining the fray. No longer will the Murlocs be the only amphibians making their presence known in the Battlegrounds. In total, Rise of the Naga will add 23 minions to the Battlegrounds pool of cards, all of which you can gaze upon below. 

Since Naga are the new hotness in Battlegrounds, that tribe will be receiving the most support, with 16 total Naga being added to the game. They'll mostly be the cards embued with Spellcraft, although there is one non-Naga with the ability. Five more minions of other types are joining the card pool as brand new minions, and two familiar faces will be making a return to the format. However, with all of these additions, there are going to be some subtractions; five minions will be retired from Battlegrounds as soon as patch 23.2 hits on Tuesday.
How much do you think the Naga will change the meta of Hearthstone Battlegrounds? Are you excited to play around with the Spellcraft mechanic? Let us know your thoughts on this big update in the comments below!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Telltale's The Walking Dead: The Final Season brought a sense of closure for Clementine in video games, but her story is apparently far from over and is continuing in comic books. We got a small taste of her next adventure in a 12-page short story in the comic book Skybound X, and now, if you run out to your comic book store today, you can see what happens next for absolutely free.  Each year, retailers celebrate Free Comic Book Day by giving away dozens of comic books from various publishers for free. One of this year's books is Clementine: Issue One by publisher Skybound Comet and Eisner and Ignatz award-winning writer and artist Tillie Walden.
This free book is surprisingly lengthy, giving readers 27 pages of Clementine's next story, as well as an interview with Walden. This story leads into Clementine: Book One, a graphic novel that releases in June. Here's the official product listing from Skybound for the forthcoming book:
Clementine is back on the road, looking to put her traumatic past behind her and forge new path all her own.















	


  
    

  
      
            


      
  










If you run out to your comic shop today, make sure you also grab Marvels Judgement Day and Spider-Man/Venom, as well as DC's Dark Crisis. All three of these books serve as preludes to big events in both universes.]]></summary>

The finale of developer CCP’s first planned arc will launch before the end of 2022. The idea is to let capsuleers build meaningful bonds with their home empires by fighting for them in New Eden’s living universe - which has always been shaped by players, not NPCs.

"Inheritance" features none of those characters or the exciting storyline on Reach with the discovery of the actual Halo ring.

On April 25, Overwatch League (OWL) graphic designer Zenofy took to Twitter, inadvertently recounting the drawn-out resurgence of Overwatch 2 and the severe recession of Overwatch 1 with three sobering sentences:
906 Days since the announcement.
767 Days since the last new hero.
1103 Days since the last new map.
The PVP Beta opened on PC 24 hours later, accumulating over 1.5 million concurrent viewers on Twitch, the highest ever for the franchise.


My friend group and I were late to the first game, but when we finally mustered the courage to play competitively, “Beyblade” Meta had started to fade into obscurity, and “Triple Tank” became the standard.

Developer Retro Forge announced that Souldiers will miss its May 19 launch and now arrives on June 2. The delay gives the team additional time to iron out some lingering technical kinks, with creative director Alberto Hernández writing in a press release: 
Souldiers is perhaps best described as a 16-bit amalgamation of Metroid exploration, RPG progression, and Souls-like combat. As either a scout, caster, or archer, you’ll battle across a fantastical land that sits on the border between life and death. You can watch the original announcement trailer here to see it in action. 
You can play Souldiers on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A not-so-long time ago in the same galaxy we all reside in, Respawn Entertainment deviated from its first-person shooter roots to create Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. This third-person action game was the studio’s first stab at tackling the coveted Star Wars license, crafting an original adventure set five years after Revenge of the Sith. It stars Cal Kestis, a padawan turned junker (played by Shameless star Cameron Monaghan) that managed to evade the Jedi purge of Order 66. After he’s outed by the Sith, he embarks on a quest to recover an artifact capable of locating force-sensitive children while also avoiding capture by the Inquisitors, who are elite Jedi hunters. 
The game features a blend of lightsaber combat and a suite of Force abilities. Borrowing inspiration from FromSoftware’s Soul series, encounters are challenging, requiring a strategic blend of blocks and parries to outduel opponents. Meanwhile, the various planets take on a Metroid-inspired progression with players unlocking abilities to backtrack to previously inaccessible areas. 
Watch on Twitch!
Fallen Order was released on November 15, 2019, and was a critical and financial success. It also served as a saving grace for single-player fans, providing proof to an increasingly multiplayer-focused EA that linear story-driven experiences can still make the big bucks. With a sequel reportedly in the works, we’re revisiting this gem of the Star Wars video game pantheon. 
Join Marcus Stewart, Andrew Reiner, and Jill Grodt on Twitch today at 2 p.m. Central as we journey through the entirety of Cal Kestis’ adventure. Expect plenty of laughs, deaths, and general nerding out over all things Star Wars. We encourage you to hang out with us in chat. Just as a reminder, subscribing to Game Informer on Twitch rewards access to the official Game Informer Discord channel where you can interact with our lovely community as well as the editors. See you in chat!]]></summary>

The Statik Selektah produced track is titled “Come Get Some” and features the vocal talents of Method Man along with PXWER and iNTeLL. In a nice touch, the beat samples Joseph LoDuca's original Evil Dead score. The song will presumably appear somewhere in-game, but you can listen to it now in the video below or seek it out on your streaming app of choice, including Apple Music, Spotify, and YouTube Music.


Evil Dead: The Game is our cover game for the month of May. The asymmetrical multiplayer title pits four players in the roles of Ash Williams and his allies against one player-controlled demon. It launches May 13 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.

Your Devil May Cries and your God Of Warses are the obvious reference points for describing Ultra Age, but it doesn't really feel like them, and I don't think it's trying to either.
The basic idea is that you're stranded on a jungle planet full of industrial ruins, and have to fight through robots and huge animals in small groups, switching between several (kinda samey) swords as needed. It's not really doing anything spectacular, but it's enough of its own thing to feel like more than just a budget God Of Cries.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Editor's Note: The views of the author of this piece do not reflect the views of the entire Game Informer staff. 
Build-A-Bear has revealed that you can now buy a plush of Grookey, the best Generation 8 Pokémon starter (easily and undeniably), in a new online exclusive bundle. 
This news comes by way of the official Build-A-Bear website, which reveals Grookey is now available to ship in the U.S. and U.K., as reported by NintendoLife. The bundle, which will cost you $65, includes a Grookey plush, of course, with a sound chip that includes the Pokémon’s cry, a matching “Leaf Shirt,” and a “Leaf Cape.” It’s basically a Grookey plush with a Hawaiian shirt on, and it looks awesome. 
“Get into the groove with Grookey,” the site’s description of this bundle reads. “This friendly Pokémon is sure to always stick by your side. The curious Grookey is a Grass-type Pokémon with green fur, large eyes and ears, and a curly brown tail. Pokémon trainers will love this exclusive Grookey plush toy bundle, which includes Grookey’s leaf print shirt, matching cape, and 5-in-1 sound chip.” 
There’s a limit of five of these bundles per customer, if you want to get close to having a full team of Grookey plushes, and Grookey as a plush cannot be purchased individually. If you want the plush, you have to buy the bundle online that includes the shirt, cape, and sound chip. 
As previously mentioned, Grookey is very much the best starter in Pokémon Sword and Shield, and you can read our thoughts on those games in Game Informer’s Pokémon Sword and Shield review. After that, read about Gen 9, which was recently revealed as Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet. Check out every confirmed Pokémon in Scarlet and Violet so far after that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Acclaimed photography adventure Umurangi Generation is making its way to Xbox consoles this month by way of its Special Edition.
The game first launched for PC in May 2020, and it puts you in the boots of a courier and photographer living in a futuristic city facing a world-ending crisis. As everything you know begins to fall apart, you’ll capture photos of these final moments to complete objectives and unfold the narrative. Thanks to various lenses, filters, and effects, you're allowed a degree of artistic freedom in how the final images turn out. The game has received critical praise, and we recently included it as one of the most intriguing photography games worth looking at. 


What makes this version special? It contains the base game and its Marco story DLC, additional modes, plus every quality-of-life update since launch. 
Umurangi Generation Special Edition comes to Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One on May 17 and costs $24.99. It will also be available on Xbox Game Pass.]]></summary>

The video was originally captured for Noclip’s 2020 documentary about the history of Arkane, the studio behind the much beloved Deathloop and Dishonored series. Ravenholm did feature, albeit briefly, in Noclip's original documentary, but now Noclip producer Danny O’Dwyer has decided it's time to show off a bit more of it, interspersing his gameplay footage with some critical context for what’s going on and the ideas behind it.

So a fan is stepping in—and back in time—to make one for themselves.

The Naga Trinity's key feature is that it comes with three interchangeable side panels, each with a different amount of layout of buttons - so you can have a regular two-button side layout for FPS titles, a seven-button layout for more complex games (MOBAs?) and a 12-button calculator-style layout when things get properly exciting (MMOs). Or you can just figure out which one is your favourite, and keep it on forever more. 
The Naga Trinity's UK RRP is £110, but it normally goes for about £70 or £80. Today, it's down to £55 - a nice discount!

Today however, you can pick up this brilliant little case for £76 in black or white, or £85 to £96 for colours like orange, purple, teal and pink. Either way you slice it, this is an incredible case for the money - and I should know, I've got two of them in my room right now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TennoCon, the annual convention and celebration for all things Warframe, is unsurprisingly happening again this year. Digital Extremes, the developer behind the action MMO, will be holding the show on July 16.
On its website, Digital Extremes announced the show's timing and that it will once again take place virtually, promising an "all-day event packed with exciting reveals from the team at Digital Extremes." Despite having to watch the festivities from home, fans of Warframes can still participate in the big day by submitting to the Community Art Showcase. "Sculptures, drawings, digital art, Captura pieces, cosplay and more — we want to see it all," says the submission form for the showcase. Clans can also show off their group's home base with the Dojo Showcase.
Digital Extremes will also be donating to a Canadian charity that has yet to be determined. The company says it will announce the chosen charity at a later date.
At last year's TennoCon, a big cinematic solo quest called The New War was revealed, which was later released in December of 2021. Digital Extremes also announced the development of crossplay and cross-save systems was in the works, though these features have yet to hit the Warframe client as of the time of this story.]]></summary>

A much-requested bundle of items known as the C.O.R.E. Defender Pack is returning to Call of Duty: Warzone in celebration of the Call of Duty Endowment hitting a landmark milestone in helping veterans find jobs outside of their military careers.
According to an announcement on the Call of Duty blog, the endowment's lofty goal of placing 100,000 veterans in high-quality jobs has been reached two years ahead of schedule. Activision Blizzard has committed even more funding to the cause to commemorate the occasion, promising to inject another $30 million into the Call of Duty Endowment. On top of that, it's re-releasing the C.O.R.E. Defender Pack for Call of Duty: Warzone, but it will only be available for a limited time.

Loot River is a run-based action roguelite with a unique Tetris-esque form of navigation. You must carefully – and strategically – pilot geometric platforms to send your character down gloomy streams to battle monsters and collect loot. 
Join me, Marcus Stewart, along with Jill Grodt, who scored Loot River an 8.5 out of 10 in her review writing, “Loot River reimagines some of its inspirations' best elements, offering players a chance to sail cleverly through each environment, grow powerful enough to slice up once-impossible threats, and unravel a story that smartly weaves into its gameplay.” Be sure to tune in to the stream to see what the commotion is about.

Keighley first announced the event’s return in March, almost immediately after word of E3 2022’s cancellation made the rounds. Summer Game Fest begins at 11 am Pacific/2 p.m. Eastern, including a live kick-off show. 
It's official: #SummerGameFest will have a big live showcase event on Thursday, June 9, streaming live everywhere at 11a PT / 2p ET / 6p GMT.@geoffkeighley hosts a cross-industry showcase with announcements, reveals and more! pic.twitter.com/iANNRxrgRj
May 5, 2022
In addition to streaming everywhere, Summer Game Fest can be watched live in IMAX theaters for the first time. Tickets go on sale sometime next week. The new partnership extends to Keighley’s other big event, The Game Awards, which will also be presented in IMAX this December. 
Surprise! On June 9, you can watch #SummerGameFest Live in @imax!
@imax to bring all the amazing game trailers and announcements to you in the world's biggest and best cinema format!

Naturally, Keighley hasn’t announced what games will appear at the show, but the IMAX trailer montage featured upcoming games such as Starfield, Sonic Frontiers, Star Wars Eclipse, and The Callisto Protocol. Before you get too excited, that footage may only be for the sizzle reel and not indicative of what will actually be shown.
E3 may not be happening, but the summer gaming event schedule is beginning to take shape. Double Fine and Iam8bit’s indie-focused Day of the Devs kicks off on June 9, The Tribeca Games Spotlight airs on June 10, and the Xbox & Bethesda Showcase was recently confirmed for June 12.]]></summary>

Incredibly, the game has delivered. I'm having fun - albeit with a tinge of unease. Not only does the game act like a blaring reminder that I've lost touch with the Top 40, it's also a bizarre metaverse where nothing is sacred.

Live today, Patch 1.13 brings with it a ton of fixes not just to quests, but to general things like the game’s UI and some of Aloy’s animations, as well as improvements to the game’s performance and stability. Perhaps the biggest issue is the aforementioned visual shimmering, which has been a player complaint since launch. 
For the uninitiated, the shimmering is an almost glitter-like effect that appears on the edging of objects, robots, and more in Horizon Forbidden West. It makes things in-game look shinier than intended and in most patches since the gam…]]></summary>

        <updated>2022-05-05T13:55:11.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Neill Blomkamp is helping Gunzilla Games write the narrative for its next game, Off The Grid. 
Blomkamp, perhaps best known for directing movies such as District 9, Chappie, and Elysium, is helping Gunzilla shape the story of Off The Grid, which the studio is calling a cyberpunk battle royale 2.0 multiplayer shooter. Calling it “2.0” makes it sound like the studio is aiming to revolutionize the genre, but of course, that remains to be seen. However, you can get a glimpse of Off The Grid now thanks to a new teaser trailer released today. 


“Dive into the heat of a covert corporate war in Off The Grid, a cyberpunk Battle Royale 2.0 multiplayer shooter where you shape the story and the gameplay,” the teaser trailer’s description reads. “Unfolding on a dystopian tropical island, OTG sends you on a head-spinning assassination and sabotage missions to the greater glory and market share of your chosen faction. Tool up for 2023: it’s about to get bloody.” 
As you can see, Gunzilla is aiming to release the game in 2023. 
Off The Grid seems like a great match for Blomkamp, especially considering many of his movies have focused on the relationship between mega-corporations and consumers. 
“The approach is to try to inject the story in a way where players have the option of engaging straight up in the battle royale or have the option of diving into story and story missions, almost like a campaign that you would be playing to follow a story narrative,” the director told GameSpot. 
He says the three different organizations in the game – the factions that Gunzilla is staying mum on for now – are fighting over a space elevator located on the battle royale’s island. This elevator leads to an asteroid mining operation that has created a lot of wealth, which is why so many of the elite are interested in gaining access to it. Blomkamp elaborates more in GameSpot's interview so be sure to check that out here if you’re interested.

“Fall seven times, stand up eight,” says Trek to Yomi’s hero, the orphan-turned-samurai Hiroki. The line represents not only his caricature-like perseverance, but something players should take to heart if they want to reach the end of this journey. However, I wasn’t always sure seeing the finish line was worth getting back on my feet. The eye-catching art direction can’t hide the title’s lackluster gameplay, empty characters, predictable story, and antiquated design. Indies are typically fertil…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Trek To Yomi is a stylish side-scroller of a samurai slasher, with an aesthetic that'll have you mashing the print screen key at every corner. Like a seasoned ronin, the combat is clean and refined. The story is simple and elegant. The visuals are straight out of a classic samurai flick. But while it gets a lot of things right, it's also a literal trek to the underworld: the scenery is stunning, but your legs hurt, and your arms ache from killing all the bandits. So many bandits! The lack of enemy variety hurts what could've been a sensational hike - but it's still a trek worth embarking on if you break it up with a few pitstops.

IO Interactive says it sees Freelancer as “the next evolution of Hitman and an entirely new way to engage with the world and characters” it’s built in the World of Assassination universe over the last seven years. Due to how “expansive and involving” Freelancer is, the team says it needs more time to work on it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some Activision Blizzard shareholders want to rake through the company’s records to investigate whether CEO Bobby Kotick pushed through the takeover by Microsoft to prevent himself being found liable for alleged misconduct, according to a recently filed complaint. The ‘220 complaint’ – a legal recourse for shareholders to seek access to company books and records – was filed in Delaware by New York City Employees’ Retirement System and pension funds for teachers, police and firefighters on April 26th.

You might best know it from Jerma985's oft-memed Rat Movie (pictured ↑ above). This comes amidst a wave of source code releases for Argonaut Games' BRender engine, which was also used by games including Carmageddon 1 & 2, Privateer 2: The Darkening, Queen: The eYe, and and Croc. This could lead to fan-updated versions which are easier to run on modern computers.

Beyond new maps and modes, we also learned that Doomfist will no longer be a damage hero and will instead be a tank, and we previewed some big changes coming to the build of Orisa, too. Right before the start of the Overwatch 2 beta last week, Blizzard also released an FAQ to answer any questions players might have before jumping.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The roster for All Elite Wrestling’s upcoming console game AEW Fight Forever got two more additions today. 
Today’s All Elite Arcade stream hosted by AEW stars Evil Uno and Adam Cole revealed models and gameplay for Kris Statlander and former Women’s Champion, Nyla Rose. It also confirmed that referee Aubrey Edwards (who once spoke to us about her career in games and wrestling in this interview) along with other officials will be present in the game. You can watch Statlander and Rose fight it out in the pair of trailers below:




Evil Uno further confirmed the game’s final title and announced it’s coming to PC. Fight Forever had been previously slated for still-unspecified consoles. 
AEW Fight Forever was first announced in November 2020 and is being developed by Yuke’s, the studio behind decades of WWE games. AEW has billed the title as a WWF No Mercy-inspired arcade-style grappler, with that game’s director Hideyuki “Geta” Iwashita contributing to development. Fight Forever will also have a story mode. Over the last year, AEW Games has slowly revealed the roster via video clips of in-development gameplay. The roster is rumored to consist of around 50 names. Excluding today's additions, the wrestlers officially confirmed so far are:
Chris Jericho
Kenny Omega
Hikaru Shida
Darby Allin
Jungle Boy
Thunder Rosa
The Young Bucks
The game is reportedly scheduled to release sometime this year, with September being the rumored launch window. Neither AEW nor Yuke’s has confirmed a release date.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last week, you decided that romance is better than de_dust2. I'm a little surprised, considering Dust 2 not only took an early lead but has likely been modded into every game which features romance too. But I accept the decision, and our mission continues. This week, I ask you to pick between a trade-off and something with no negative consequences at all: drawbacks, or a load of lasers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[May is a relatively quiet month when it comes to new PC games. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing, of course. The first half of 2022 has been unusually stuffed with great things to play, and I’m sure a lot of us will be thankful for the opportunity to spend some time with the few bits and pieces that were overshadowed by your Elden Rings and your Dying Light 2s earlier in the year.


For those looking for something new, however, May still has a lot of interesting stuff to offer those hungry for an indie game or two. Think of me this month as a waiter in a fancy restaurant, offering you a carefully curated selection of bite-sized delights as part of our tasting menu. What we have on offer is both nutritious and delicious, a journey through genres that is sure to excite the palette.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you’ve ever wanted to race in a kart racer game by way of propane, Apple Arcade will soon have you covered. 
That’s because Warped Kart Racers is a new kart racer coming to the premium iOS service that will let you race as Hank Hill, lover of all things propane, from King Of The Hill. He’ll be joined by other cartoon characters such as Peter Griffin from Family Guy, as well as Stewie, Stan from American Dad, and more, as first reported by Eurogamer. In fact, Warped Kart Racers will feature five characters from Family Guy, five from American Dad, five from King Of The Hill, and five from Solar Opposites. 
You can check out the Apple Arcade trailer below:


As you can see, it features multiple characters from the TV series mentioned above, and you’ll be able to race around 16 maps as them. It also includes “tons of customizations,” such as different outfits for each character, wheel types, glider types, and more. Plus, you can play with up to eight friends in online multiplayer. 
Warped Kart Racers does not yet have a release date, but the trailer says the game is coming to Apple Arcade this month, so it sounds like you won’t have to wait long to play.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My FixFox journey, not unlike that of the titular little furry protagonist Vix, has been abnormally long and strange. I started playing it, then moved and didn't have a PC for a long time, and it was only recently I finally got my PC back and finished the game last week. It took me around 12 hours of playing the game to travel around a strange cuboid planet using postage stamps to fix hairdryers for robots, but stretched over three months in real life. And reviewing a game this many weeks after release isn't normal procedure either, but I really like FixFox and I want people who might like it to stand a better chance of finding it. I also think a break of several weeks isn't the worst way to experience it, either.

The free, time-limited event is still all about hoovering up medallions for your chosen class, but there are two new elements called Strike Scoring and Strike Medals to consider this time around. Strike Scoring is based on your time spent in Guardian Games playlists and where you rank, while Strike Medals are won by “pulling off some pretty impressive feats, like taking out a ton of enemies with a fancy little combat jig like Shatter,” so Bungie say.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Crytek announced back in January that Crysis 4 was real and in the “early stages” of development. Since then, the company has stayed quiet on the sequel but this week, the studio revealed that the game now has a new director. 
Revealed on Twitter yesterday, Hitman 3 game director at IO Interactive, Mattias Engström, will direct Crysis 4. He’s wasting no time, too, because Crytek says he begins work on the new first-person shooter this week. 
We are happy to announce that Mattias Engström, known for his work as Game Director for Hitman 3 at IO Interactive, joins the Crysis family as Game Director for the 4th installment in the Crysis franchise, starting this week. pic.twitter.com/hHkOrXIAt6
May 3, 2022
Engström is a great get for Crysis 4, especially considering how well Hitman 3 turned out. You can read our thoughts on it in Game Informer’s Hitman 3 review to find out why we gave it a 9 out of 10. If you haven’t yet played Hitman 3, you should, and if you’re excited about Crysis 4, you can play through the first three games in the Crysis Remastered Trilogy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Obi-Wan Kenobi, the Disney Plus series hitting the service on May 27, follows the titular character following the events of Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith. A new trailer provides another look at the trials Obi-Wan will face, including confronting his former apprentice. 
Kenobi is on the run, looking to find, protect, and train Luke Skywalker, son of his former apprentice Anakin Skywalker. He must also find refuge away from the Inquisitors, an Imperial group of elite soldiers looking to find him and kill the remaining Jedi. It looks like it’s going to be a great time, both as a new story in the Star Wars universe and as a return to beloved characters like Ewan McGregor’s Kenobi and Hayden Christensen’s Anakin Skywalker turned Darth Vader. 

We get a glimpse at both Vader and the Inquisitors, as well as new looks at Kenobi, Luke Skywalker, his uncle, and more in a new trailer released by Disney today to celebrate Star Wars Day. You can check it out below: 


As you can in the trailer, the Inquisitors are on the hunt and they won’t stop until they can bring Kenobi to their master, Darth Vader. And speaking of Vader, we get a quick glimpse of him putting on the pieces of his iconic suit right at the end. Here’s hoping he’s suiting up for Kenobi vs. Skywalker Round 2 because that’s something we really want to see. 
To accompany the trailer, Disney has also released a new poster for Obi-Wan Kenobi that features both the titular character and Darth Vader and it's very dope.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today is May 4, which means it’s Star Wars day, and to celebrate the occasion, TT Games is releasing two new character packs for its latest game, Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga. 
More specifically, characters from The Mandalorian and Star Wars: The Bad Batch will hit the game today. In total, these two character packs bring 10 new playable Lego-fied characters to The Skywalker Saga.


For the uninitiated, The Bad Batch is a spin-off of The Clone Wars and The Mandalorian is a sci-fi western that centers on a very Boba Fett-like Mandalorian whose job is to protect a young member of Yoda's race (AKA "Baby Yoda"). If you haven’t yet watched Season 2 of The Mandalorian, you should try to avoid today’s DLC because the characters from the new Mandalorian pack are based on Season 2 of the Disney Plus series. 
“Warner Bros. Games celebrates Star Wars Day with the launch of two new DLC packs for Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga – The Mandalorian Season 2 and Star Wars: The Bad Batch,” a press release reads. “The Mandalorian Season 2 pack will include Ahsoka Tano, Boba Fett, Bo Katan, Fennec Shand, and Moff Gideon. Star Wars: The Bad Batch character pack will linclude Hunter, Wrecker, Tech, Crosshair, and Echo.”
If you own the Character Collection Pack for the game, you’ll receive both of today’s packs as well as the packs based on Season 1 of The Mandalorian, Solo: A Star Wars Story, Classic Characters, the Trooper Pack, and Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. You can also purchase each pack individually. 

TT Games says Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga, which was released just last month, holds the record for the biggest Lego game launch ever. You can read Game Informer’s review of the game here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've never been one for playing aggressively in turn-based tactics games. I will hug and skulk between half and full height walls like nobody's business, creeping up the map inch by inch lest one of my precious party members accidentally sets off an entire warren of alien nasties by blundering too far ahead or, heaven forbid, one of them gets nicked by a stray bit of shrapnel. To say I'm overprotective is an understatement. 
Thankfully, the Grey Knights in Warhammer 40K: Chaos Gate - Daemonhunters are made of sterner stuff. I mean, just look at these brutes. They're enormous. Even the Gears Of War lads would be jealous of the kind of muscle these big robo boys are packing, I'm telling you now. They're by no means invincible, of course, but they can hold their own out of cover, and pick themselves back up again when your best laid plans inevitably start going down the drain. It may not be my most natural style of tactical manoeuvring, but man alive is it liberating.

For Gilbert, his involvement has apparently brought a lot of comments, and an expectation that whatever he's making will line up with comments he's made over the past twenty years. 

Not so, says Gilbert. On the subject of his previous comments, he says "None of these are promises or anything I owe anybody."

Originally set to release in January of 2021, Ubisoft revealed toward the end of 2020 that the remake had been delayed two months. Just three months later, Ubisoft announced that The Sands of Time was delayed indefinitely and that’s when fans began to wonder what was going on with this remake.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Logitech G502 Hero is the most popular gaming mouse on the market, not to mention the RPS reader's choice and our current 'best gaming mouse overall' - so it's exciting news that it's going cheap on Amazon UK today. 
£29.99 is the cheapest we've ever seen this mouse, beating out last year's Black Friday price, and it's also 63% off its UK RRP. That's a fantastic deal for a comfy mouse with 11 programmable buttons, adjustable weights and an 'infinite' scroll wheel. 
If you prefer your mice with more batteries and fewer cables, the wireless G502 Lightspeed is also discounted heavily, from £129.99 to £57.99. I reckon that's strong value for a mouse that remains comfy, high-spec and fully-featured, while adding on Logitech's industry-leading wireless tech. The wireless mouse is also much less frequently discounted than its predecessor, which does tend to see a price drop in line with the major 'shopping holidays' of the year.

Blizzard Entertainment has pulled back the curtains on its rumored Warcraft mobile game, revealing that it’s called Warcraft Arclight Rumble and features an “extensive single-player campaign, co-op play, and PvP.” 
Unveiled today in a new cinematic trailer that you can watch below, Warcraft Arclight Mobile is a strategy game coming to iOS and Android devices in select regions later this year. Blizzard says it’s been designed from the ground up for mobile devices, and it’s set in the Warcraft universe. As the trailer below reveals, it seems like Warcraft Arclight Rumble is an arcade game of sorts that heroes and villains in the Warcraft universe play in pubs and the like.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After coming out of the gates with a bang, Halo Infinite has seen its share of quiet months. Some events have kept players coming back, but fans have been left wanting for some time now. Hopefully, that all changes today as Halo Infinite Season 2 is here, and we're streaming the fun live starting at 2 p.m. CT over on Twitch!
Watch on Twitch!
Join Game Informer Halo fan Alex Stadnik as he hops back into developer 343 Industry's latest title to go hands-on with all the new additions. One of the main draws of the new season comes from the two new play spaces fans will slay each other upon. First up is Catalyst, a smaller arena map that is visually reminiscent of past combat zones such as Guardian from Halo 3. Big Team Battle fans aren't to be forgotten, as they too will be getting a map to wreak havoc on in Breaker. This Banished ship-breaking yard is a sprawling molten space where players will have to carefully avoid some of the lava pitfalls on their way to securing the Gravity Hammer.
New maps aren't the only addition in Season 2, though. Fans will finally get new modes to try out in the form of Land Grab, Last Spartan Standing, and the classic King of the Hill. On top of that, there are more narrative and special events, a sparkling new battle pass, and a more fully fleshed-out version of the multiplayer 343 hoped to release last year. But will it be enough to keep Halo fans happy? You'll just have to join us on today's stream to find out!
If you are enjoying our Twitch streams, be sure to subscribe to the channel to know the second we go live and to gain access to our Discord channel. On top of special shows like today, we also stream every Thursday and Friday to check out the latest new game and celebrate the past with Replay, respectively.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sonic Prime is an upcoming animated Netflix series that was first announced in February 2021. We haven’t heard much of a peep about it since, and though we’re still waiting for a proper trailer, a new promotional video provides the first glimpse of the show. 
Netflix released a trailer montage promoting its upcoming slate of kid-friendly animated shows. Sonic Prime pops up at the very end, with Sonic sprinting and collecting rings across Green Hill Zone. Sonic also speaks, giving fans the first sample of voice actor Deven Mack’s performance. You can catch the clip at the 1:49 mark. 


Unfortunately, Sonic Prime still doesn't have a premiere date. We only know that the show consists of 24 episodes and centers on Sonic fighting to save a multiverse from supposed doom. Netlfix's official description of the series pegs it as a "journey of self-discovery and redemption." Other cast members include Ashleigh Ball, Shannon Chan-Kent, Brian Drummond, Vincent Tong, Ian Hanlin, Kazumi Evans, and Adam Narada. 
It’s a great time to be Sonic the Hedgehog. His second theatrical film had the best opening weekend of any video game movie in history, a third film has already been greenlit, and another animated show spun-off from those movies is coming to Paramount+. He’s also got two games slated for 2022. Sonic Origins, a remastered bundle of classic Sonic games, arrives in June, while Sonic Frontiers, the hedgehog’s first open-world adventure, releases later this year.]]></summary>

Like a shorter Black Friday, this can be a good opportunity to pick up some PC gaming hardware at severely slashed prices, so if you’re currently weighing up a new SSD or replacement mouse then it may be prudent to hold off until the event gets underway. And you might not even need to shop at Amazon for it, as some rival retailers like to run their own deals to compete with Prime Day directly.

He is not my favourite character in Citizen Sleeper but he is the one who best represents it. In one scene he explains his deep anti-capitalist reasoning to you. Systems should not govern people's behaviour, he says, the people are what matters.
Throwing off the shackles of a faceless process governing your life is a recurring theme in this blend of sci-fi RPG and interactive fiction, and it makes for a strong rags-to-ramen story of one robot on the run. Even when the game's own systems of dice and clocks clash with its stories of human interest, it is the people who come out on top.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today I visited a virtual launderette to do my virtual laundry in Roblox, lining up alongside online strangers who were also washing their virtuasmalls. After loading the machine, filling my powder, and carefully selecting then starting my cycle, I watched through the door for 12 minutes as my washing sloshed and spun. And then I watched another players's washing in disgust. Visiting this laundry simulation has made me realise I have strong opinions on how other people run their imaginary washes. You wouldn't believe the laundry crimes I've seen.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The development of Shenmue III seemed like a long shot. Eighteen years passed between the latest entry and Shenmue II. For almost two decades, fans were unsure if their favorite brawler would ever return. Then the seemingly impossible happened: Yu Suzuki's Shenmue III Kickstarter campaign amassed more than $7 million and over 69,000 backers. The third chapter in Ryo Hazuki's revenge quest was released in 2019 to mixed critical reception and performed "fine" financially. Suzuki recently voiced enthusiasm for Shenmue IV but primarily wants the game to be more accessible for newcomers.
According to VGC, Suzuki spoke about Shenmue IV at a special event in Yokosuka, the city where the story takes place. Suzuki said that Shenmue IV was created with longtime fans in mind, which might've inadvertently alienated newer players. Despite being satisfied with overall reactions to the game, Suzuki felt that it wasn't a good entry point. Currently, there are "no concrete plans" for Shenmue IV, but Suzuki wants to make sure that it can appeal to a broader audience.
"With Shenmue 3, I really responded to the fans’ voices, so I wasn’t necessarily thinking about making any money,” Suzuki announced at the event. “But since I’m running a company, I have to think about what can sell if I continue. I’ve been seriously talking about it over and over again.” 
Publisher Deep Silver's parent company, Embracer Group, released a statement about Shenmue III's financial success in 2020 during an earnings presentation. CEO Lars Wingefors stated that the third game was a "core niche product." 
There are no confirmed development plans for Shenmue IV. Even so, Suzuki has stated an interest in continuing the series. In other news, Square Enix sold Crystal Dynamics, Eidos-Montréal, And More, Including Tomb Raider IP, To Embracer Group.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Garden Path appeared just about a year ago, a sort of slightly more complex-looking Animal Crossing. Lauren played the demo a few months back and found it to be lovely, and indeed, what's not to love about a pretty 2D world where you potter about and plant things, and trade things with different anthropomorphic animals that wander through. There's a slightly chonkier preview build knocking about now, and I'll say this for it: you need to put the time in.
There's more to say as well, but that was my main takeaway from the current build. Much like actual gardening, a lot of The Garden Path is inscrutable to me - at least from the visits I've made to the garden so far, which is actually more of a free-form forest at present. Presumably after some effort on my part I can shape it how I'd like. But if current trends hold that will take a long time. Cos plants.

Whether you consider this a celebration of spring, the start of summer, a day for workers, or just a long weekend, may you have a good'un. We've had a busy fortnight, with CJ Wheeler joining us as a news reporter and me becoming associate editor (I am still not sure what that means). So how nice that we'll be away on Monday, returning on Tuesday. What are you playing until then? Here's what we're clicking on.

Well, there's more of it again, now, with the release of the Dynasties Of India DLC. If you want to watch an elephant headbutt a pyramid until it bursts, watch the trailer below.

That means it's still fun even if you remove the ball and, say, turn it into a free-for-all battle royale about punting opponent cars out of bounds. That's what the time limited Knockout Bash mode does, which is available from now until May 10th.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Finding your niche can often be the key to success for smaller developers, but Swedish team Image & Form refuse to be pigeonholed. Over the last ten years they've tackled every genre, from tower defence to turn-based tactics, RPGs and action platformers. With their latest game, The Gunk, they've finally entered the realm of 3D adventure games. Released on Xbox Game Pass at the tail end of last year, The Gunk was a big step up for the makers of SteamWorld Dig. Not only was it their first game in 3D, and their first time using a new engine, but it was also their first title that had nothing to do with the series they'd built their name on. As it makes its way to Steam today, I sat down with director Ulf Hartelius to talk more about the creation of the game's titular goop, and how the timing of its environmental themes about cleaning up its gunked up planet was much more than just a Death Stranding-style happy accident.

The Wasteland Theatre Company has even built a stage they say is modelled after London’s Globe Theatre, renowned for its performances of the Bard’s plays. They’re a week late to celebrate Shakespeare’s birthday, but I won’t judge because I can’t even add up properly in Freddos.

I'm not a fan of most fighting games. All too often they have too many elaborate moves, too much memory testing, or they feel like glorified puzzles you have to figure out the one solution to.
Hats Are Not Allowed takes an approach I find far more interesting. Combat is pared down to a few basic principles, and the challenge comes from learning how to combine them, and timing is less about animations than about second guessing your opponent. I can't say it's one of the best dueling games ever, but it's the best one I've played for ages.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A rooster calls, and the sun rises as I stock the shelves for another day in Winkeltje: The Little Shop, a business management game about running a little store in a fantasy town. I recently inherited Hefford’s Hovel and, after a manic start, have managed to become well-known for my loaves of bread. Each day customers charge into the store and raid the various displays, tussling over freshly-baked rolls before scrambling home to slap them on a plate. It’s mass hysteria, but what can I say? I make damn good bread.
Fresh meals are just one of six item categories you can sell in Winkeltje, but I don’t need to worry about the rest. Over a few in-game days, your store starts to specialise in the goods you stock, so customers will visit expecting to find those same items. When you enter the Hovel, you’re greeted with the toasty warmth of the oven as the scent of baking dough drifts through the air. You won’t see us preparing potions or crafting clothes, no sir. For that, you’ll have to go elsewhere.

To get the discounted price, use code SAVE75 to knock a healthy £75 off the list price. That brings it down to £1054, just £5 more than the UK RRP and a great deal for an OC model. You also get free delivery, with the card slated to arrive just after the upcoming bank holiday.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Melos Han-Tani and Marina Kittaka, the dev duo that make up Analgesic Productions , seem to make games about scientists. Young, the hero of their Link’s Awakening-influenced debut Anodyne, may not technically be one, but he bears the coke-bottle glasses and white coat that may make you think he is. Aliph, the put-upon protagonist of the haunting, grief-stricken 2D side-scroller Even The Ocean, works as power plant technician. Nova, hero of Analgesic’s tour de force Anodyne 2: Return To Dust, labours as a Nano Cleaner, one with the ability to shrink inside the psyches of those plagued by Nano Dust, corrupting their thoughts. Even the word analgesic itself has a scientific background; the term means a pain-relieving drug.


When the player begins Analgesic’s newest game Sephonie - part 3D platformer, part deep emotional story - three Taiwanese biologists make their way onto the titular island to explore. As the Steam page puts it: “Amy Lim, Taiwanese-American and bold leader, hails from the midwestern USA town of Bloomington. Riyou Hayashi, an analytically-minded Japanese-Taiwanese researcher, calls the bustling Tokyo his home. And Ing-wen Lin, a kind and considerate Taiwanese scientist, lives in Taipei.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After a year in early access, Rogue Legacy 2 has born a 1.0 heir, and it's a game I've become well-acquainted with over the last few days. They're a complex individual with violent tendencies, but invest in them and they'll flower into a roguelike that you won't be able to detach yourself from.
The game is a worthy successor to the original Rogue Legacy, and one that builds on it with a wealth of incentives to make your runs more rewarding. Upgrades up the wazoo, gold bursting from your breeches, double-jumps and air-dashes. Progression is a pleasure, basically, and it's something that never becomes a bore, no matter how good you are at staying alive. I mean, the game is built with death in mind, after all.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We're a two-hander this week, as Nate has a sore throat, but Matthew and I have a jolly old time talking about the games that sound like amazing ideas on paper (whether they end up being great off the paper or not) and even manage to contrast them with games that sound like a bad pitch but end up great. We manage to talk about a lot of games in a sensible way, and even gesture at serious discussion of how prestige indies can dominate their niche to the detriment of other interesting games.
Also we talk about holes quite a lot.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This year’s Xbox and Bethesda Games Showcase will take place online on June 12th, Microsoft have announced today via Xbox Wire. The announcement is light on details right now, as you might expect, but there’s the promise of a “diverse line-up of games coming soon to the Xbox ecosystem, including upcoming releases to Game Pass on Xbox and PC”. Personally, I'm hoping we'll see our first proper gameplay footage of Starfield, given it launches almost five months to the day from that date. There could also finally be some movement on in-development projects like the next Fable from Playground Games and Undead Labs’ State of Decay 3 too. Here's hoping!

A pleasantly unpleasant new free horror game goes down inside the real Sunderland metro station of Park Lane, and I can't think of any other game set in the Northern English city. I am delighted when hyper-local mundanities appear in video games.

Off your cute wee peglin goes on an adventure, battling baddies and claiming treasures, but damage is dealt by pling-plonging orbs down Peggle/pachinko boards and you have a bag of different orbs instead of cards. I like it, and it has a demo you can try for yourself.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Until last year, the idea of having a 'forever game' never really clicked with me. I'm too old and thin-skinned to enjoy the competitive nature of most online FPS games, and rallying together a regular squad of buddies to tackle the world of games as a service always seemed too much like hard work. Heck, even the allure of daily challenges in some of my favourite single-player games has never quite hooked me in the same way I've seen them take hold in friends and family. But with Dorfromantik, the chill, pastoral village builder from Toukana Interactive, I finally understand the journey towards that mythic 'forever' status.

It's golf with cars, or Rocket League with golf, and it's launching a cross-platform beta tomorrow.
