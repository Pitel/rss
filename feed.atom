If you're looking for another skateboard fix on the Switch, it seems Easy Day Studios will finally be releasing Skater XL on the hybrid device this December.
Yes, after bailing on a Switch release way back in 2020, the developer has now locked in a 5th December 2023 release fo the price of $39.99 USD. We've even got a new trailer to confirm this, so it seems it's really happening this time! The developer has also confirmed 60 FPS for the platform across both modes.

The wind sticks to the sweat on my forehead, cooling my face and tussling my hair like a breezy aunt. Looking down, I see the tatters of the clothes I'm wearing. I don't know how I escaped death. I don't know when my luck will run dry. All I know is the long road ahead, winding round the coast and disappearing behind a crest.


Then, a surprise sight fills my heart with glee. A small cabin, open and inviting. Its dilapidation a thing of beauty. Its broken roof, a veritable stronghold.

Not only have recent events left me with a deep anxiety about finances, it seems that a lot of people are struggling, and the best you can hope for is to struggle less. I don’t want to discuss this on a deeper level, so instead, let’s talk about Wall Street Kid.


Wall Street Kid is actually known as The Money Game II: Kabutochou no Kiseki in Japan, meaning that, yes, it’s the second in a series, with the first game never seeing a release outside of Japan. You could also look at the games as a spin-off of another Sofel series, Casino Kid, but they’re not actually related aside from sharing a developer.


I want to note off the top that I wouldn’t consider Wall Street Kid to be kusoge. It’s really not that bad, and Sofel did a great job localizing it by bas…]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-11-27T22:17:34.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A surprise hit from Shonen Jump + is getting its anime adaptation. The supernatural-and-extraterrestrial action-comedy manga Dandadan will be adapted into a TV anime series next year.


If you haven't heard of Dandadan, the elevator pitch is simple but effective. Two students, Ken Takakura (a.k.a. Okarun) and Momo Ayase, are at odds. The latter believes in ghosts, hailing from a family of spirit mediums. Takakura is obsessed with the occult—aliens, cryptids, and such. Both stubbornly agree to visit locations where the other believes supernatural experiences have occurred. 


So, naturally, both of them are correct.


What ensues is Yukinobu Tatsu's Dandadan, an energetic and action-filled manga with a surprising amount of heart. It seems incredibly well-suited for an anime adaptation, and even more, it's being produced by Science Saru.




Dandadan Takes Off


Science Saru has quickly become a familiar name in animation, thanks to some incredible feature and series work. The studio, helmed by Masaaki Yuasa and Eunyoung Choi, was behind films like The Night Is Short, Walk On Girl and Inu-Oh, as well as series like Keep Your Hands Off Eizouken!, Devilman Crybaby, and the recent Scott Pilgrim Takes Off.


Look at those series, and you see a particular knack for comedy, monsters, and surrealism that seems like a perfect fit for Dandadan. Fuuga Yamashiro is taking the director's chair on this series.


This series has been one I've absolutely adored reading through the backlogs of, as it manages to balance out emotional story beats with good laughs and action. Add in some stellar monsters and character design as the stakes escalate, and this could be hit for 2024. Considering the year we've already had in anime, it's a good time to be following it all.

By the time the N64 hit, the NES felt old to me, so the idea of a console even older than that was exciting. This was before you could jump onto YouTube to look up gameplay. I wanted to see it for myself.


It wasn’t until college, around the time that the retro gamer identity really became a thing, that I finally found myself a 2600 Jr. Since then, I keep tripping into 2600 games. I own around 60, which isn’t as impressive as some of my other libraries, but considering I never actively tried to find Atari 2600 games, it says something.


A major issue with this, however, is that every model of the 2600 uses an RF output, and modern TVs hate it. Even late-model CRTs will sometimes refuse to display an Atari 2600…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since premiering in late October, Five Nights at Freddy’s has become a big box-office success. It’s already the highest-grossing horror film of 2023, and it has now become horror production company Blumhouse’s highest-grossing film of all time.
The film adaptation of the popular 2014 horror game hit theaters on October 27, grossing a strong $80 million in its opening weekend, the best for any horror film this year. That’s even more impressive given that it premiered on the streaming service Peacock the same day it was released in theaters (becoming the most-watched title on Peacock during its first five days). 
Five Nights At Freddy’s has continued to gain traction over the past few weeks and has now grossed over $295 million ($136 million domestically, $160 million overseas) during the month it's been in theaters. That ranks it at the top of Blumhouse’s highest-performing films, a record previously held by M.Night Shyamalan’s Split, while also climbing over top performers such as Halloween (2018), Get Out, and Glass. 
FNAF is the BIGGEST @blumhouse film of ALL-TIME. Just passed SPLIT. thanks to Emma Tammi, Scott Cawthon, cast & the New Orleans crew, the Henson team, & our partners @universalpics & @peacock. @jhutch1992, @matthewlillard, @Piperrubios, @elizethdlail
November 27, 2023


First announced in 2015 (roughly a year after the first game’s release), Five Nights At Freddy’s stars Josh Hutcherson (The Hunger Games series) with actors such as Elizabeth Lail and Matthew Lillard in supporting roles. The film is directed by Emma Tammi and produced by Blumhouse. The film joins the ranks of other highly successful video game adaptations to release in 2023, such as the other box office juggernaut The Super Mario Bros. Movie and HBO's critically-acclaimed The Last of Us.

It’s a bit hard to describe the difference between Earthbound influence and Mother 3 influence, but it’s there. Knuckle Sandwich seems to be in the Mother 3 camp.


Actually, Knuckle Sandwich is a bit of a mash-up of Mother 3, Undertale (which was also inspired by Mother 3), and WarioWare. At times, it seems to push the concept to the extremes. Other times, it wallows in it.


Knuckle Sandwich is mixed. How much you enjoy it is going to depend on your tolerance for its pacing, and if its weirdness and humor are enough for you to overlook some glaring flaws.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Perhaps the most underrated entry in the Assassin's Creed franchise, Assassin's Creed Syndicate, is free on PC through December 6. Those interested in living out the life of an Assassin in London during the Industrial Revolution can do so at the Syndicate giveaway page. As long as you claim your free copy before December 6, you will be able to play even after the promotion ends. Unfortunately, it looks like the promotion is only available on PC via the Ubisoft Connect launcher.




At the time Assassin's Creed Syndicate was released, I was very much feeling the AC franchise burnout. I purchased Syndicate but never actually got around to playing it for more than just a few minutes. However, a little over a year ago I had some free time and played through the whole game and was very pleasantly surprised. In fact, I think Syndicate may be one of the best Assassin's Creed titles in the franchise.


Syndicate was the last classic Assassin experience in the franchise before it started exploring more open-world narratives in Origins, Odyssey, and Valhalla. The series recently returned to its roots with Mirage, but I'd still argue that Syndicate was overall the most polished assassin simulator we've gotten so far.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Those looking for a smoother Dragon Ball FighterZ online experience can soon try it out with Rollback Netcode. Bandai Namco has locked in a Public Beta Test for the feature from November 30 through December 10.


The announcement came via the official Dragon Ball Games Twitter and Bandai Namco Entertainment producer Tomoko Hiroki. Just in time for the lead up to the Power Tournament finals in January, everyone is invited to take part in the beta on Steam. You can see the full message in the announcement video below.




For those interested in participating, the Steam announcement page has all the details. The test will be open to everyone who bought the Steam version of Dragon Ball FighterZ. All you have to do is go to the game in your library, open the Properties window, and select public-beta-test from the Betas tab. There are a few troubleshooting notes for anyone who has an issue finding the option. If you'd rather go back to the normal version during the test period, you'll be able to switch by selecting 'None' in the Betas tab. 


Dragon Ball FighterZ first launched for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC in January 2018, followed by a release on Nintendo Switch that September. At the time of this writing, the Public Beta Test for Rollback Netcode is just going to be available for the Steam version. For what it's worth, all versions of the full game are heavily discounted on the platform right now. Any further updates during the test period will be made through the official Bandai Namco Esports Twitter account.

Originally slated to launch on February 27, The Final Shape now launches on June 4. In a blog post, Bungie states that the expansion “needs more time to become exactly what we want it to be”.
“The Final Shape is the culmination of the first ten years of Destiny storytelling and, for Guardians everywhere, countless hours spent together,” Bungie writes in the post. “We want to honor that journey, so we’re taking the time we need to deliver an even bigger and bolder vision, one that we hope will be remembered and treasured for years to come.”

The Tales series has been a staple of RPGs since the franchises' origins in 1995. 2021's Tales of Arise brought the series to modern audiences. By the time I dove into Dahna and Renah in early 2022, many people had already fallen head over heels for its spectacular combat, lovable characters, and grand aesthetics.

One of those companies is Nuverse, a game publisher best known in the West for its work on Marvel Snap. Fans of the superhero card-battler had reason for concern this morning, as an article from Reuters reported that ByteDance had plans to leave the gaming space entirely, with intentions to "divest from titles already launched." This seemed to spell doom for Marvel Snap.
However, the official Marvel Snap X account issued a statement today that this would not be the case.
Dear SNAPPERS,
November 27, 2023
It's unclear exactly why the PC and mobile game will be exempt from any changes, but we're happy to hear that one of the best games from 2022 isn't going anywhere. However, the fates of the workers at Nuverse and the company's other games are unclear, as Reuters reports that "the decision is likely to impact hundreds of employees." The report states that ByteDance will announce this restructure sometime today.

Somehow, it has been 15 years since Professor Layton and the Lost Future (or 'the Unwound Future', depending on your region) made its debut in Japan. As with every entry in the mainline series to date, it took another couple of years until the third entry received a Western release, but when it finally did, we could see that Level-5 was onto something special with its detective puzzle series.
The time-hopping story that tied up the loose ends of the two earlier games, the continued puzzle quality from the late, great Akira Tago, and the emotional damage of that ending. The Lost Future is the Layton series firing on all cylinders, but it was also the final time (chronologically) that Hershel and Luke would take the starring roles before things went all Star Wars-y in the ensuing prequel trilogy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Even though the delay was leaked amidst monumental layoffs at Bungie not even a month ago, Bungie has now officially confirmed that Destiny 2: The Final Shape has been delayed until June 4, 2024. According to the blog post, Season of the Wish which begins tomorrow will serve as the major content loop until The Final Shape releases in June.




New content planned for April


This equates to a roughly four-month delay, which while isn't the longest amount of time, sets Destiny 2 up for running with the same content loop for half a year which is a pretty long time. In an effort to break down the repetitiveness, Bungie plans to release a new content update in April titled Destiny 2: Into the Light. The two-month-long content update will prepare players for their journey into the Traveler.


Destiny 2 Game Director Joe Blackburn also posted a video update on YouTube in which he broke down the content players can expect between now and the release of The Finale Shape.


As someone who hasn't played Destiny 2 in a while, I was genuinely interested in returning with The Final Shape. It seemed like a great opportunity to jump back on board with the newly added system to play through specific important story missions to get caught up on things. However, with the layoffs and now hefty delay, I have to admit I find the interest waning. 


For those who are actively playing, is the updated content window for Season of the Wish too long? Six months can seem like a lifetime when playing the same content over and over. Hopefully, the new content scheduled for April is enough to freshen things up until June.


Destiny 2: The Final Shape releases on June 24, 2024.

The indie hit somehow melded fishing with cosmic horror - seamlessly - to create an enthralling adventure where you can never be sure if what you're about to haul out of the depths will have a normal amount of eyes or tentacles. The new Pale Reach DLC gets even weirder, a masterpiece of show-don’t-tell horror that manages to evoke some of the more inspired Bloodborne monsters as well as some of icy, supernatural scares from The Terror. And it's all centred on a big whale. 


Spoilers ahead, friends, but in The Pale Reach, a massive icy landscape has suddenly appeared in the southern, well, reaches of Dredge's world, so naturally we’re off to see what that’s all about, ploughing along in our faithful fishing boat to the hostile new climate. Every path into the landmass is barricaded by imposing ice walls. It's a slog.


It’s also a great setup. We're made to instantly wonder what the hell hides in this treacherous ice field, and the answer is equally great: a massive corrupted narwhal with bulbous glowing eyes. The huge beast dwarfs your tiny ship, but mercifully it’s frozen solid in an even bigger chunk of ice, with only those very angry eyes poking out at us. Four angry eyes on one side of its head, to be very precise.

It's no secret that we at Nintendo Life love Super Mario Galaxy. Since its release in 2007, we have played through this planet-hopping adventure several times with both Wii remote and Joy-Con (thanks to its re-release in Super Mario 3D All-Stars), but every day is a school day and we have just learnt that there is a specific control quirk that changes how high the plumber bros. can spin jump.
Yes, as showcased in a recent post by Twitter account @MarioBrothBlog, it turns out that both Mario and Luigi have preferences for which hand you should swing if you want to perform the highest possible spin jump — who knew?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Talk about adorable! Two new Pokémon Squishmallows are available for preorder and they’re the cutest thing ever. The two new Squishmallows recently went live for pre-order the Pokémon Center website after an announcement of the new plushies earlier this year.


The Pokémon joining the Pokémon Squishmallow family are Clefairy and Teddiursa, two earlier-introduced species. Long-time fans of the franchise will be happy to see Generation I and Generation II characters as adorable plushies. Some of the other Pokémon that have been featured as Squishmallows are Snorlax, Togepi, Piplup and various versions of Pikachu.


Clefairy is a Fairy type Pokémon introduced in the first generation of Pokémon in 1996 ('98 for North America). Teddiursa is a Normal type Pokémon introduced to the franchise in Generation II, through Pokémon Gold and Silver. 


Something fans may not know about Clefairy is that it’s an extraterrestrial Pokémon, meaning that it isn’t from Earth. The bubbly pink Pokemon is best known for being cute, among many other creatures in the franchise. Teddiursa, on the other hand, is very down to earth. The little bear Pokémon is known to have paws drenched in honey. For comfort when nervous, Teddiursa will lick its paws (cuteness overload, am I right?).

Squishmallows are a California-based stuffed toy business that specializes in turning popular video game and anime characters into adorable plushies. In 2022, the Pokémon Company partnered with Jazwares to bring their franchise to Squishmallows. Since then, they’ve released loads of cute Squishmallows.


Currently, the Squishmallows are only available for preorder on the official Pokémon website in the US for $29.99 apiece. Once live, the Squishmallows will take around 5-9 business days to ship. These 12-inch cuties also come with an embroidered Pokémon Center Poke Ball logo.

        <link href="https://www.destructoid.com/lethal-company-smashes-player-record-retains-top-spot-steam/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=lethal-company-smashes-player-record-retains-top-spot-steam"/>
        <updated>2023-11-27T16:37:30.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[By now, much of the indie horror scene is aware of Lethal Company, the small co-op hit that's currently taking the genre by storm. While it's hard to say how long this popularity will last, the game is not only staying at the top of the Steam charts, but has smashed its player peak again.


As of right now, Lethal Weapon has hit 184,015 players over the last 24 hours. The chart over on SteamDB shows the trajectory the game's currently experiencing, and it's entirely possible that it could just keep going. We could easily see it break through the 200,000 mark.




It's also still the top non-Deck game on Steam right now, having not budged since the last time we checked. Okay, it's only been a week, but seeing as the likes of Modern Warfare 3, Counter-Strike 2, and Baldur's Gate 3 are starting to drop, it's a hell of an achievement for an independent game.


For those who have yet to play it...


Compared to such games as Phasmophobia, Lethal Company is something that should be right up the alley of horror co-op fans. That includes me, but sadly, I haven't got round to playing it yet. And I should, as it's extremely cheap to buy. I can't speak for other nations, but here in the UK, it's £8.50. I know some pubs that charge more for a pint than that.


The game's all about scavenging and collecting scrap for a company called...well...the Company. According to developer Zeekerss, you can "use the cash you earn to travel to new moons with higher risks and rewards--or you can buy fancy suits and decorations for your ship."


The Steam reviews have also been pretty glowing, with it showing as "Overwhelmingly Positive." User Cheiph describes it as a "morbid, yet derpy masterpiece." I think it's high time I pull the finger out and finally see what all the fuss is over in Lethal Company.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's a new Tribes FPS in development, eight years since the last Tribes game, Tribes: Ascend, went skeeting off into the no-further-updates hereafter. It's the work of former Hi-Rez subsidiary and nowadays independent studio Prophecy Games, and going by SteamDB listings, it's called Tribes 3: Rivals.
New to the Tribes series? It once went by the unofficial title of "the world's fastest shooter". On the one hand, I'm not sure that claim holds as true in the era of Titanfall 2 or DOOM Eternal or Hyper Demon or heck, even latter-day Fortnite with its rocket-powered rams. On the other hand, and to pick up the tune from Matt Cox's (RPS in peace) 2019 retrospective - WHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE. Here's a compilation of footage from a recent playtest.

        <updated>2023-11-27T16:31:57.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rumors and speculations have led many to believe that the release of the Silent Hill 2 remake is imminent. However, we're all still dreaming, and developer Bloober Team is asking that people chill out for a little bit longer.


In a statement posted to the studio's Twitter, Bloober has said it's "diligently working to ensure the Silent Hill 2 remake attains the highest quality." Work is also said to be "progressing smoothly," and the team understands that fans are waiting patiently for any updates.




However, in the meantime, the developer is kindly asking for "a bit more patience" from the fan base. The statement ends by assuring people that as and when publisher Konami does share information, the "wait will be worthwhile."


Commence thumb-twiddling


Understandably, fans are keen to know what's happening with the much-anticipated remake. Silent Hill 2 is generally regarded as one of the most influential survival horror games of all time. Of course, with that comes a small amount of uncertainty and maybe a little pessimism.


Despite their visual quality, Bloober Team games have been criticized in the past. Most notably, 2021's The Medium drew notes of disapproval for its depictions of mental health. That's not to say the game wasn't good, but some felt its representation of mental issues was lacking somewhat.


As a result, a few may be a little wary about how Bloober will handle Silent Hill 2, particularly in terms of its psychological themes. In any case, the studio is going to have to put a lot of effort in to keep new and old fans happy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During the holiday season, a few games get Easter eggs. Better Than Life took to Twitter to reveal that the Christmas theme is returning to Kayak VR: Mirage, and it also gave an update regarding new content. 


For the holiday season, Kings Canyon is spruced up with snowy mountains and flying sleighs. It's a minor change but it's a good way to get you into the festive season. The team also visited Reddit to address when new content is coming. 




Better Than Life claims that development has been a hard process that took a toll on the three-person team. Consequently, they couldn't keep working at the same pace they had previously been. The team writes: "this year has not been as productive as we would have liked it to be." If you're looking for more content, don't despair just yet, as it is still on the way, though it may take some time. 


Part of the delay is coming from the team porting the game to Unreal 5. This is being done to include "visual improvements like nanite that really make a difference." It's also necessary for the sake of future-proofing. 


I previously discussed the current state of PS VR2, and Kayak VR: Mirage is one of the games that came up. Although it's a great game, I did point out that it gets boring quite quickly. With new content, I'll have a reason to revisit the visually beautiful VR title. 


If you're looking for more games that feature holiday season Easter eggs, keep an eye on Death Stranding which typically has Sam Bridges in a Santa hat, or GTA: Online which usually has Los Santos snowy during December.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My Hero Ultra Rumble recently got a Season 2, just after its launch in September of this year. Bandai Namco dropped Season 2 of the MHA brawler on November 24, featuring one fiery addition to the roster in Endeavor.




One of the most anticipated changes that Season 2 will feature is a new playable character. Fiery and fierce hero Endeavor has been added to the playable lineup. Endeavor is featured in the Plus Ultra Roll banner, while the vein-wielding hero Ibara is headed to the Character Tickets section.


Alongside the Flame Hero, players are getting a new “Duo”, or two-player team, option where 12 teams of 2 can go head to head in battle. You can also spice up your fighters' looks in game with new costumes being added to My Hero Ultra Rumble Season 2.


My Hero Ultra Rumble is a fighting title based on the popular superhero manga-turned-anime My Hero Academia. This battle royale based fighter features matches between teams of players, made up of characters from MHA. In the series, characters are able to use “quirks” or supernatural abilities that make them a bit out of the ordinary, in combat and in everyday life.


My Hero Ultra Rumble only features an online mode, meaning that there is no offline option for the game at this time. The free-to-play fighter is available for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Microsoft Windows.

        <updated>2023-11-27T15:14:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bloober Team has unexpectedly provided a light update on its upcoming remake of Silent Hill 2, ensuring fans that its development is “progressing smoothly”. You'll just have to wait for Konami to share more details. 
In an X post, the team behind The Medium and Layers of Fear asks for fans’ patience in regard to new information on the game while stating that development is going according to schedule. Konami announced the Silent Hill 2 remake last October with a lengthy trailer showcasing the 2001 classic’s updated presentation. The game currently has no release window but will launch on PlayStation 5 and PC. 


Here is Bloober Team’s full update: 
Silent Hil 2 remake was one of many new Silent Hill projects announced last October. The first one to arrive was Silent Hill Ascension, an interactive streaming series that premiered on Halloween. Other projects in the pipeline include Silent Hill f, a new mainline entry set in 1960s Japan, and Silent Hill Townfall, a mysterious title published by Annapurna Interactive and developed by No Code, the creators of Observation. A new live-action film called Return to Silent Hill is also in production by original Silent Hill director Christophe Gans.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We haven't heard much word on the Silent Hill 2 remake lately, particularly regarding a possible release date. Until then, you can get your SH on by downloading this mod for Resident Evil 4, which brings Konami's world into Capcom's.


Nexus Mods user AmanoSomething has imported some of the outfits from the original Silent Hill game into the remake of RE4. According to the images and the mod description, you can now dress Leon Kennedy up as Harry Mason.

There's also a costume for Ada Wong that makes her look like police officer Cybil Bennett, two costumes for Ashley (Lisa Garland and Alessa Gillespie), and Luis can now dress up as Dr. Michael Kaufmann. Even Lord Saddler gets the Silent Hill treatment with a Dahlia Gillespie recolor.


Two worlds combine


We still have no idea when Konami plans to release Bloober Team's remake of Silent Hill 2. The Steam page still has it down as "coming soon" and while many weren't thinking it would be out in time for Halloween, a lot of us were assuming 2023 would be a potential release window.


However, with December just around the corner and the game nowhere in sight yet, you'd be forgiven for assuming you won't find it under the Christmas tree this year.


While Silent Hill: Ascension has been something of a letdown for many, seeing SH2 making a comeback will keep fans going. However, given that the original 2001 release has gone down as one of the greatest survival horror games of all time, doing a successful remake of it is a pretty tall order.

Last Train Home has an intriguing premise: taking the Czechoslovak Legion home from the Eastern front via an armoured train directly through the chaos of the Russian Civil War. Its unusual mixture of survival sim, RPG, tactical skirmishes, and narrative history holds together, I think, precisely because your efforts to make it all work provide such a contrast to what an incredible mess the world around you is becoming.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'll be honest, Lethal Company can be a pretty scary experience. The last thing I think I'd want is to see my head turned like a screw in virtual reality. But if that sounds just peachy, you may be interested in a Lethal Company VR mod.


The mod is currently in development, but there's been enough done for a short video demonstration. Twitter/X user Flat2VR shared some footage of the current build of the mod, which is under development by "DaXcess / rodabafilms." At first blush, it looks about as typical as you can get for VR. Looking around corners and up stairwells is as effortless as moving your own head. It's the kind of freedom is something I'd find pretty welcome in a game where giant Bunker Spiders lurk in dark places. And that's pretty much everywhere.

Lethal Company VR mod currently doesn't have a release window as of yet


With Lethal Company only about a month old, a VR mod for it will still likely take a bit of time. Still, the footage shared by Flat2VR is looking solid. As an occasional VR player myself, there isn't much that stands out to me as a problem. Of course, we don't see any examples of dealing with enemies or leaping over ledges. Many VR games also allow you to set head height and teleportation or blink movement to help with nausea, all of which may be in the works. Either way, having played Phasmophobia via VR in the past, all I can say is that it'll easily make Lethal Company all the scarier. As if that was ever needed.


Lethal Company is a horror game at its heart, and quite difficult as well. Before diving in for that precious scrap, consider preparing yourself with our guide on Hazard Levels.

Host Geoff Keighley recently had a Twitch stream where he addressed questions from the public and spoke a bit about why Dave the Diver has found itself in the Best Independent Game category. 


As Keighley highlights, people interpret the term indie differently. While some might consider a game's budget, others will look at the team's size, and it's also possible to focus on the aesthetic or scale of the game. Consequently, some have argued that Baldur's Gate 3 is an indie game, or even Death Stranding which was created by an independent studio despite receiving major funding from PlayStation.

We live in a blinking lovely time right now. Gone is the notion that genres like real-time strategy (RTS) and management sims can’t be controlled with a standard controller, and we have the likes of Two Point Campus and RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 Complete Edition on Switch to prove it. Joining that field is SteamWorld Build, the latest game in the beloved SteamWorld series, and the first in 3D.
On the surface, things seem very simple. You have a city in which you need to build (!) homes, refineries, and resource extractors. Each home can house a maximum number of workers, and the happier they are — dictated by the service buildings nearby and the resources available — the closer to that maximum you’ll get. SteamWorld Build does such an excellent job of easing you into its mechanics that it can seem almost painfully basic at first glance, but that’s all part of the plan.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In another lifetime, SteamWorld Dig could have easily ended up as SteamWorld Build. When Image & Form first released their 2D digging platformer back in the depths of 2013, its moreish loop of carving out rocky chasms, finding gems and treasure, then upgrading your pickaxe and burgeoning township back on the surface was instantly captivating, and its 2017 sequel continues to be one of my favourite platformers of all time. Now, a decade later, SteamWorld Build has reimagined Dig's core ideas as a handsome citybuilder, placing equal focus on managing your rustbucket town up top, while plundering its depths via an abandoned mineshaft to find treasure, resources and (most importantly) rocket parts, so you can escape your crumbling planet and find a new homestead up in the stars.
Despite the threat of annihilation hanging over the horizon, however, SteamWorld Build is one of the most relaxed and easy-going building games I've ever played. This is a game that's more concerned with keeping your economy running like a well-oiled, uhh, machine than turning a profit, for example, and it merely dips its toe in the genre's wider, ongoing obsession with building up defences to fend off oncoming hordes of malicious town hall-eating nasties. If the scales do get thrown out of equilibrium, the worst that will happen is you get lots of angry little red robot faces appearing above your houses. You won't go bankrupt, you won't get turfed out for being incompetent, and you definitely won't see any kind of game over screen if the aforementioned nasties end up running amok in your mining levels. The stakes, then, are quite low, which is probably a good indication of whether you'll get on with SteamWorld Build, and how much you'll get out of it.

The most endearing aspect of the SteamWorld series is how each of its games relates to one another despite their disparate genres. From tower defense to turn-based RPG, each title offers a unique spin on a specific gameplay experience while adhering to a shared mythos, resulting in a fun collection of games that coalesce thematically. SteamWorld Build, Thunderful's city-builder/RTS hybrid, serves as the latest iteration of this formula. Sporting streamlined genre mechanics, intuitiv…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Many of you will be aware that Left 4 Dead began as a mod for Counter-Strike called "Terror Strike." However, it looks as though Valve accidentally released an early version of the former via an update of the latter.


In patch 1.6 of Counter-Strike, players noticed "Terror Strike" had been compiled, seemingly unintentionally, and released to the public as part of the update. A post from Twitter user Gabe Follower shows a brief clip from it, with a comment saying that it didn't take long for the community to work out how to play it.




Indeed, a video from the YouTube channel ilovethevopo not only showed gameplay footage from this Left 4 Dead prototype, but made it available for download.


The basic pieces are all there


As you can see, it looks and plays like Counter-Strike, but with the addition of "zombies" as the player moves around the map. In Gabe Follower's clip, when the player places the bomb down on the target, we hear the familiar Left 4 Dead zombie howl before they're set upon.


During development, L4D was intended as a versus game, but some feedback from Gabe Newell and others at Valve soon saw it change into what we know today. Of course, versus mode is still there, but its four player co-operative mode was what made it stand out.


The game turned 15 recently and is still held aloft as one of history's greatest zombie shoot-em-ups. While the likes of Back 4 Blood attempted to revive the dormant series by offering a spiritual successor, in the end it couldn't quite match up to what Left 4 Dead fans were hoping for.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This article is written in partnership with MicroProse.


Want to command a WWII carrier group from within? That’s the exciting and slightly frightening premise behind Task Force Admiral Vol. 1: American Carrier Battles, an upcoming naval RTS from famed sim publisher Microprose. 


It plunges you into the heart of the post-Pearl Harbour Pacific theatre as a U.S. Fleet Commander, up against a formidable Japanese naval force. Switch from a top-down perspective to a full 3D view and watch each meticulously researched unit take to the air as you lead your carrier group to victory. 


Or not, because while battles are ripped right out of history, Task Force Admiral Vol. 1’s AI will give you a run for your money. Pause the action if you need thinking time but if, in your folly, you’ve left your own carrier exposed, you’ll have a frantic, fearful rush to defend it before you meet a watery demise. 





There are definite shades of MicroProse’s own Carrier Command, one of many reasons we’re hyped for this game. Developer Drydock Dreams Game’s infectious passion is another; Task Force Admiral vol.1 exists because they were sick of waiting for someone else to make it. 
If you’ve the slightest interest in naval combat or WWII history this absolutely needs to be on your radar. 


Add Task Force Admiral vol.1: American Carrier Battles to your Steam Wishlist now.



The post Task Force Admiral Vol. 1: American Carrier Battles is shaping up to be a naval wargamer’s dream. appeared first on Destructoid.]]></summary>

With the release of the sixth and final wave of the Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Booster Course Pass, the latest entry in Nintendo's top-rated racing franchise is presumably fully content complete.
So with that now done, where on earth does the franchise go from here? It's probably safe to assume that Nintendo has a firm idea of what the next Mario Kart game will look like, but in the spirit of wishful thinking, our lovely video producers Felix, Alex, and Zion are here to discuss their thoughts.

It is a dreadful god of gossip and reportage, a hideous, paradiscursive entity of boundless appetite, whose Number is Infinity+1 and whose Sign is the Serrated Spiral. It's one of many abyssal denizens of a dungeon dimension outside of Time, where nothing changes and there is accordingly an apocalyptic hunger for News. My ancestors, the Brigante Celts who once ruled the misty valleys of Yorkshire, called it keno-augā-brājat, or “the cave that will never be filled”. But nowadays, we call it the Maw.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As Final Fantasy 7's release date draws nearer, Square Enix has been revealing more information about the highly anticipated game. In a recent Tweet, we found out more about Chocobo customization and Chocobo races. 


As the Tweet reveals, you'll be able to visit Chocobo ranches, and here you'll find Chocoboutiques where you can customize and recolor your bird's equipment. These options aren't available solely for aesthetic reasons, as the gear you throw on will affect your bird's performance in Chocobo races. 




In an interview with IGN, director Naoki Hamaguchi explained a bit more about what you can expect from Chocobos in FF7 Rebirth. There's no Chocobo breeding this time around, though there's still plenty to do with the birds. Hamaguchi revealed that you'll get to enjoy an "enhanced new Chocobo capturing feature" to acquire the birds that you can then use for traversal. 


He also spoke about the Chocobo races, highlighting that there will be several different tracks and varied courses available. Hence, you'll be able to spend hours just racing the birds. Though all Final Fantasy numbered titles are mostly self-contained, some recurring elements are present in several games, including Chocobos. They have been depicted in different ways, though they're always adorable. 


You'll get to enjoy the big birds once again when Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth launches on February 29, 2024, on PS5.

We've got an equivalent guide for European Switch gamers, but while both sales include some of the same games, they're not identical.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[An arcade fighting classic of the '90s is about to return to game centers in Japan. Sega announced an updated version of Virtua Fighter 3tb, which is set to debut on November 28. 


The new arcade iteration is, appropriately enough, titled Virtua Fighter 3tb Online (via Gematsu). On top of updated balancing and new skills, the meat of this version is the addition of online battles. 


Thanks to Virtua Fighter 5: Ultimate Showdown's technology, 3tb Online lets players take on others throughout Japan. Players can also put their names and records on display and edit and view them on the official website with the use of Aime cards. 




What is Virtua Fighter 3tb?


Virtua Fighter fans in Japan got their first crack at Virtua Fighter 3tb when it made its arcade debut back in September 1997, a little over a year after Virtua Fighter 3 launched. Like the Online addition to the new version, the tb in the title is pretty straightforward. It refers to the three-on-three team battle mode that served as the arcade update's default state. 


A flashback to those halcyon arcade days serves as the introduction to the new trailer. The preview also showcases the aforementioned Aime card compatibility before rolling into some of the soundtrack options and flashing through the playable roster, from Akira to Jeffry McWild. 


The whole thing looks like a treat for fans of the earlier entries in Sega's long-running series, but for now, it's a Japan-only delight. There is currently no announcement as to whether Virtua Fighter 3tb will make its way outside of Japan or to home consoles.

Yet while Valve's handheld is great for playing indie games and older AAA titles, there are some circumstances where it's simply not fit for purpose. It isn't really suited for twitchy multiplayer shooters, while glossy ray traced experiences are beyond its capabilities. So if you're after that kind of gaming on the go, a laptop remains ideal, and you can get a great portable gaming device for less than a grand this Black Friday weekend.

Welcome back to another edition of Box Art Brawl!
Before we get cracking with this week's epic battle, let's take a look at how Contact went on with its own duel. It was incredibly close; possibly one of the closest brawls we've seen to date, but ultimately the design favoured by North America and Japan won the round with 51% of the vote. Good effort though, Europe, bad luck.

Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2 launched on the Switch earlier this month, and in its next patch, it will be making a lot of changes based on community feedback.
In the latest post on the official game website, it's mentioned how version 1.3 will be the team's "largest early gameplay directional adjustment update". The adjustments made are a response to the fact players have "quickly pushed" the mechanics in the game to their absolute limits.

Not anymore. After over twenty years, Valve programmer Ben Burbank has fixed the bug - and explained how he did it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There will almost certainly never be an end to the sheer number of things Doom can be ported to, but earrings are a new one. We've already reached the point where Doom was running inside Doom in some weird Inception-style melding (is that a dated reference?). Now, someone has managed to combine the iconic FPS with fashion.


Streamer, "self-taught dev," and Twitter user Alina has posted a short clip of herself wearing a pair of Game Boy-inspired earrings. Only these earrings can be seen playing a dinky version of id Software's classic shooter, Doom.




This came about not long after Alina posted a tweet about how said earrings can actually be programmed to play Tetris on them. Soon after, user @zKassaiAudio set things in motion by predicting that someone would run Doom on the earrings, which is exactly what happened.


Can I get a pair?


Looking at some additional Twitter/X posts, Alina says she's using the Thumby keychain. This is a tiny gaming device from a company called TinyCircuits, which has been designed after the Nintendo Game Boy.


Given that the Thumby is programmable, it's feasible for anyone with coding skills to put a micro version of Doom on there. As for the earrings, they'll need to be bought separately. It might seem like a gimmick, but it'll give you something to play when your phone's out of signal.


As for the game itself, well, Doom officially turns 30 years old next month. That's longer than some people reading this have been alive. It begs the question of how id (and the fans) will be celebrating its legacy. Doom fashion accessories seem like a good start.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Amazon doesn't specifically list this as a Black Friday deal. But it's certainly a bargain that you can take advantage of this Black Friday weekend. AMD's Ryzen 5 5600X processor is available for just either side of half-price, depending on which side of the pond you live on. Regardless, that's a big chunk off one of the best gaming CPUs around.


When Katharine reviewed the 5600X back in 2020, she called it "a stonkingly fast gaming CPU". It's a six-core, twelve thread processor, with each of its Vermeer processors providing speedy single-core performance, making it an ideal CPU for playing both modern multithreaded games, and older single-thread titles. There are of course plenty of faster CPUs around these days, but you'll pay significantly more for those, and it's only prudent to do so if you're looking to get the highest framerates at 1080p. If you're gaming at 4k, then it's your GPU that'll be doing most of the heavy lifting, and your funds are better spent there.


It's also worth noting that the 5600X is highly power efficient, with a TDP of just 65 watts. This makes it both more economical and more environmentally friendly that a lot of CPUs, an important consideration if your energy bills are making you wince.

The almost two-minute animatic paints a pretty cool image of what we’ll experience come December 5.  We get a glance at Dr. Eggman’s dreamscape plus some story details. And who doesn’t like animated Sonic? Rhetorical question. Everyone loves it.




It doesn't hurt that the Sonic Dream Team intro is animated by Hesse, whose impact on the Sonic series has been nothing short of influential. Getting his start doing fan art of the self-proclaimed “Fastest Thing Alive,” he found work within the Sonic…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For the 25th anniversary of Half-Life, Valve not only released a documentary about the iconic FPS, but also sent out a pretty significant update to celebrate. While the Half-Life patch brought with it some bug fixes, there was one that it didn't manage to iron out. Until now, that is.


In a short clip uploaded to Twitter/X by user @VinciusMedeiro6, another update that rolled out recently has fixed an issue with the Blast Pit chapter of the game. Anyone who's familiar with Half-Life will be familiar with this section, and the bug in question concerns an unlucky scientist.




When Gordon Freeman steps into a control room, a giant, tentacled monster crashes through a window and grabs a panicked, lab coat-wearing NPC. Unfortunately, perhaps due to limitations at the time, the boffin is dragged off by the monster, but the off animation makes it seem like he's floating in midair.


Argh! A flying scientist!


This little immersion-breaking hiccup has been part and parcel of Half-Life for the past 25 years. Even the big anniversary update didn't fix it. But now, it seems Valve saw fit to finally give this small (but wholly iconic) cutscene some additional care.


You can see the result in the clip posted above. For a comparison, @VinciusMedeiro6 also uploaded the original. This way, you can really see the difference this little tweak has made to what must have been a terrifying ordeal for the bespectacled scientist.


Since turning a quarter of a century old, Half-Life has enjoyed something of a resurgence, reaching its highest-ever player peak, even without fixing this bug. It sort of cements just how significant the release was (and still is), both in the FPS genre and in gaming in general.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[RAM is rarely the first consideration when upgrading a PC, as it has a much smaller impact on performance compared to a better processor or a spanking new GPU. But you also won't get without far it, and we are slowly heading toward the point where more RAM is preferable. This year brought a scare when Star Wars: Jedi Survivor seemingly needed a minimum 32GB of RAM. Luckily that turned out to be an error in the system requirements, but as the size and detail of video game worlds exerts greater demand on load times, RAM will become more important. And if you want to get ahead of the game(s), you can get 32GB of rock solid ram for less than £50 this Black Friday weekend.

November 21st, 2023 marked the 25th anniversary of The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time's Japanese launch. To celebrate this historic Hyrulean occasion, we're running articles throughout the week dedicated to the game, our memories, and its legacy. Today, Ollie recalls how Ganondorf's mysterious introduction is one of the very best in gaming...

It might seem an almost preposterous notion in 2023, but there was once a time when Ganondorf was an unknown quantity in the Zelda universe. Before The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, the snout-faced Ganon was — either directly or indirectly — the main villain of the franchise, but for those first couple of hours exploring the new 3D land of Hyrule, we could only guess at who this “wicked man from the desert” was.

Planning a multi-turn offensive in a 4X game like Civilization or outfitting your party with optimal gear in a Strategy RPG like Fire Emblem: Three Houses can take much trial-and-error and many of us can only grab small windows of gaming time.

Basic details pertaining to a novel aspect of the injunction were reported but little seemed wildly out of the ordinary. It transpires that the High Court initially had reservations concerning the order, but the biggest surprise is what Sky aimed to block: "relatively banal" content of limited value.

For goodness sake, just eat it. If a meal's worth remembering, then your brain will cling to the memories of those flavours for all they're worth. Anyway, external SSDs have other applications too. The right external drive can be a great place to store games, whether that's big games that you're not playing at the moment, or just as your standard install for smaller, lighter games. If that sounds useful to you, then you can currently get a discount on the best External SSD for gaming this Black Friday.

By slicing off the rarely used numpad keys, a TKL board gives you a little extra room to wiggle your mouse, or actually put a cup of coffee to one side rather than jamming it somewhere between your keyboard and your monitor. The only problem with TKL boards is they tend to be slightly more expensive than their bulkier counterparts, meaning you often end up paying extra money for less keyboard overall. But if you are in the market for a slimmer typing solution, then right now you can get £100 off one of the best TKL keyboards this Black Friday.

It hasn't been used in years, and I should probably put it in its pouch to stop it from getting any dustier, but I like looking at it. Hands down, it's one of the most elegant handhelds of all time. 


PlayStation has a stellar track record when it comes to home consoles, but its history with peripherals and portables is a little spottier.

In addition to capturing them and harnessing their abilities in battle, you can also wield realistic firearms and other weapons to blast them apart or, more hilariously, arm your cuddly critters with some serious heat.
“Pokémon with guns” has become the shorthand description of Palworld, but the experience packs in survival mechanics, base-building, a central narrative, and other bells and whistles.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Videogames are full of loops. Often, the loop isn't just a loop in space but a loop of labour, a loop in time. It's a repeated task with a touch of variation from cycle to cycle, typically associated with a character progression system of some kind. The classic one is the town-dungeon loop in an action-RPG such as Diablo 4. You sally forth into the depths with sword and shield, slaughter a bunch of blameless goblins, then orbit triumphantly back to the village square with its 24/7 forge and bustling adventurer's guild. Then off you go, once again, with a Sword +1 and a shield now bearing a Goblin Magnet. There are straightforward equivalents in multiplayer, especially in the wake of Call Of Duty 4: Modern Warfare - sign in, play a few matches, harvest some XP, unlock a new laser sight, equip it, play a few more matches with +5% to your aim.

The game doesn't ask you to do anything particularly complicated - there's a tower, and you're supposed to climb it. Proceed, and you'll find yourself on a delightful and occasionally challenging journey that manages to tell an emotional tale.

What is Jusant?


It's unlike anything else, though there are some games worth comparing it to if you're trying to figure out what you're getting yourself into. Much like Journey, Jusant offers a calm yet curiosity-piquing atmosphere, and while you're not always certain where you're going and why, the promise of solving mysteries motivates you to keep moving forward.

Miles Morales is a comic book character created to represent people of color.
Leading up to the 2008 election, which resulted in the United States’ first African American president, Barack Obama, Marvel wanted to "take a good look" at one of their icons to reimagine as African American. A few years later, when an internet campaign pushed Community actor Donald Glover to play Spider-Man, the icon was chosen, and writer Brian Michael Bendis and artist Sara Pichelli created Miles. Every iteration of the character continues this legacy of representation, and Insomniac Games’ Spider-Man 2 is no different.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I really liked the NZXT Function keyboards when they launched last year, and I still do today: all three are cleanly-designed and responsive gaming keyboards, and their hot-swappable mechanical switches make it a doddle to customise the under-the-finger feel. And speaking of today, it happens to be Black Friday, so we can add "up to 50% off" to their list of qualities.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of my favourite game experiences is basically anything that makes me go "what is happening?" in the right combination of bewilderment and joy.
Little Goody Two Shoes is a life simulator adventure dating game hybrid full of secrets and mutually exclusive options that encourage replays. Going into it blind definitely heightened the sense of enjoyable confusion, and the joy of gradually going from "is... is this gay?" to "oh this is super gay" and "is this a game about hiding secret gay relationships from the backwards villagers" to "oh this is totally about being secretly gay and also automatically covering for a witch because these people can eat it".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week on the Electronic Wireless Show podcast we talk all things GTAVI augury, what with the community going bananas for secret GTAVI clues, and Rockstar finally announcing that they'll have a trailer for the next Grand Theft Auto arriving in December. Our predictions are in fact not as outlandish as you might think, although there are gorillas, obviously.


Alongside this we talk about the games we're playing right now (largely Darktide, it turns out), and dish up some recommendations. We also spent like a third of our recording time playing a deranged Age Of Empires 2-themed RPG using an abbreviated D20 system of Nate's devising, but don't worry, I edited it down quite a lot. Apologies for my poor mic quality!

You can listen above, or on on Spotify, iTunes, Stitcher, or Pocket Casts. You can find the RSS feed here, and you can discuss the episode on our Discord channel, which has a dedicated room for podcast chat.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It is admittedly unfair of me, but any time a video game reveals itself as free-to-play, my interest immediately dissipates. Free-to-play games are not universally bad; plenty of brilliant design ideas, engaging stories, and fun mechanics can be found in games with no upfront admission fee. But once a game’s goal shifts from singular experience to long-term engagement, any excitement I may have folds in on itself and disappears like Pac-Man.
It all stems from my desire for experiences, not obligations.
In free-to-play and comparable models, success is marked by player engagement. The more rounds a player queues into and the longer they play, the more likely they are to engage with the monetized elements. And the best way to encourage that engagement is to incentivize players to return. Dai…]]></summary>

Black Friday now provides the chance to grab one for even less, with good-quality partner cards having fallen as low as £550 in the UK and $515 in the US.

No time like the present, then, to net yourself a top-quality storage extender for your Steam Deck or Steam Deck OLED.


It is of course possible to swap out the Deck’s internal SSD for something bigger, and if it were a desktop PC, normally that would be the way to go. But replacing components in a tightly-designed, hyper-compacted machine like Valve’s handheld is a far trickier business, and just doesn’t have the same appeal when a fast microSD like the Pro Plus is right there. Now, you can get plenty of extra space, an incomparably easier "installation," and performance that still comes remarkably close to NVMe SSD level, all for up to £38 off.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On Thanksgiving, it was announced that over 20 million players have played DON'T NOD's Life is Strange. 


Originally released in 2015 in an episodic form, Life is Strange follows Max Caulfield as she discovers she has the ability to turn back time. At first, it seems like she has just what she needs to fix all her problems and help her friends. Soon enough, she discovers that all actions have consequences, and using her powers comes with a cost. 


The game earned itself a cult following thanks to its realistic depiction of teen life and the complex but beautiful relationship between Max and her rebellious friend Chloe Price. It spawned several titles, including the prequel Before the Storm which centers on Chloe. 




There've been several Life is Strange titles since 2015 but none of them have managed to replicate the magic of the first game. The latest title, True Colors, was released in 2021 and tells the story of Alex Chen the empath. It's worth a playthrough thanks to its marvelous use of music. You also get to explore Haven Springs which is a small town with a lot of heart. 


If you want to experience Max and Chloe's story again, or you're new to the franchise, there is a Remastered Collection available which contains Life is Strange and Before the Storm.

One of the most notable features is how RGG rethought its classic brawler combat. Protagonist Kazuma Kiryu now has two fighting stances, Yakuza and Agent, the latter of which comes with a host of new secret-agent tools, such as an exploding cigarette, a Spider-Man-like cable he can use to whip enemies around, and so on. 
We recently had a chat with RGG series chief producer Hiroyuki Sakamoto – who we spoke with last year about the future of the studio – to learn how Gaiden's new combat together, maintaining the series' identity despite how much has changed over the years, and why RGG doesn't look to…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cheap graphics cards are practically mythical these days, which is great news for gaming obsessed unicorns and centaurs, less so for us mere mortals trapped in boring old reality. But there is one last torchbearer of the budget GPU, and weirdly enough that's Intel. If you happen to live in the US, then you can get your hands on the best cheap 1080p  graphics card for a smidge more than $200 for Black Friday.


Now I know the idea of Intel making graphics cards sounds almost as preposterous as horses with horns, but they've been at it for a while. Granted, they've not been especially good at it for most of that time. The original launch of the Arc series was pretty disappointing. But Intel have worked to imrprove the performance of their GPUs, and now the Arc A750 is an excellent 1080p offering.


It's also a perfectly acceptable card for those looking to make their first-steps into the world of Ray-tracing. As James notes in his review "if you’re specifically looking to try ray tracing on the cheap, know that the Arc A750 turns the tables on the RX 6650 XT with these kinds of settings. Where the A750 produced 47fps in Hitman, the RX 6650 XT could only manage 29fps, an even steeper drop from its respective rasterised performance."

Kyle also touches on Assassin's Creed VR before the duo moves on to the main course: ranking fictional video game birds on criteria like how tasty do they look and how bad would we feel about eating them. After that, we finish out the show with some gestures of gratitude and reader questions.

It's a time of year for gratitude, togetherness, repeatedly attempting to explain my job to older relatives, and most importantly, a time when a lot of people come together to eat one really big bird. But here's the thing. Why do we always eat the same kind of bird? I mean, turkey is fine and all, but why not branch out a bit? Why not chicken, or quail, or pheasant?
And that got me thinking – why limit my daydreaming to real-life birds when there's so much delicious-looking poultry in video games? Sure, not every video game bird would be tasty, but it's worth assessing in case I ever get Jumanji-ed into a game one day.
Here's my rating of video game birds based on how good they'd be for Thanksgiving dinner.

There’s a small handful of 13th-gen chips at good prices, but nothing on par with the AMD Ryzen 7 5800X or Ryzen 7800X3D that Will highlighted earlier this week.


I have, however, spotted a surprise £20 discount on the Intel Core i7-14700K, which just happens to be the only CPU in the new 14th-gen lineup that actually is worth buying. And so, just as it carried the Raptor Lake Refresh launch, so too must it redeem Intel’s Black Friday showing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This year's Call Of Duty entry is Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, but it's actually the second Modern Warfare 3 because the first Modern Warfare 3 came out in 2011. In my multiplayer review, I say that it preys on nostalgia, because it does! The game's multiplayer schtick is all about bringing back classic maps to act as a smokescreen for a lack of direction. At least, that's what I think.
I find all this nostalgia stuff interesting, mainly because it's coincided with three other events in my own personal timeline (Chapter 29 Season 11, you could say): A League Of Legends pro-player called Faker, the resurgence of a badminton star, and Fortnite's own OG event. The thing that separates them all from COD? A plan.

Developed by Polish team Frozen Way, whose other projects include, erm, Hairdresser Simulator, it casts you as Hennessy, a human xenobiologist who is starting afresh on the alien planet of Sota7.
As in Unknown Worlds’ survival sim, you’ll search various biomes for resources, build solar-powered habitats on stilts with nice, wide windows, and gradually amass a database of local animals and plants. Unlike in Subnautica, you won’t be constantly at risk of suffocation.

It might have more entries in it than any other series out there and it won’t be slowing down anytime soon. On top of that, thanks to its anthology-like nature, if one Final Fantasy game doesn’t click for you, there’s a good chance another one will. As a result, ranking the Final Fantasy series can be highly contentious. Everyone has a lot of love for the first entry they played, and then there are heavy hitters like Final Fantasy X and VII, too. 
However, the staff here at Game Informer did the seemingly impossible: we ranked all 19 mainline numbered Final Fantasy games, including their direct sequels, from worst to best. As a reminder, this ranking is the sum of collective thoughts of the Game Informer staff and your own pers…]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-11-23T15:33:05.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Both the Steam Deck and Steam Deck OLED come bundled with cases – new and improved ones, if you get a 1TB OLED – so it wouldn’t initially make sense to invest in a third-party one. But Steam Deck accessories can take many forms, and I’ve been particularly convinced by the case style that combines a space-saving protective skin with a tougher removeable cover. Since the Dbrand Project Killswitch isn’t playing Black Friday ball, it falls to my other favourite, JSAUX’s ModCase, to provide the bargains.


It works thusly: instead of taking your Steam Deck in and out of a zip-up sarcophagus every time you want to play it on the move, you simply leave the handheld wrapped in the ModCase’s snug, rubbery skin, simultaneously protecting it and adding grip as you hold it. The front cover simply snaps on and off as needed. It’s a lighter, more compact alternative to a full case that, I can say from experience, absolutely shields the precious Deck effectively enough for everyday bag duty. As the name suggests, it’s modular as well, so you can mount other accessories (like kickstands, power banks and even a secondary cooling fan) to the back of the skin.


Just want the case? No bother, that’s down from $30 from $26. There’s no UK version of the JSAUX store, unfortunately, though JSAUX ships internationally. Just click through the link below, and select which kit you'd like.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know this is the second Crucial P5 Plus deal we’ve posted about in two days, but hey, it’s Black Friday week. ‘Tis the season. Besides, this time there’s something for us Britain-dwelling lot as well, as the 2TB P5 Plus’s price has been slashed 60% to £88 on Amazon UK – the lowest it’s ever been.


This is, to be clear, an almost mystifyingly small amount of money for a 2TB NVMe SSD that’s also capable of real high-end transfer speeds and game load times. Maybe not to the standards of its successor, the Crucial T500, but this is still a competitively quick-acting drive with oodles of space for game installations. The same goes for its heatsink-equipped edition, which also happens to be on sale in the US at $88, making it (currently) cheaper than the non-heatsink 2TB model. Good deals all round, then – told you ‘twas the season.

Its main hook? Turn-based battles are filled with WarioWare-style minigames, many of which are unique to the kooky residents or rats you come up against. Unfortunately, I'd say its main hook is actually its most painful barb, and one you're barely able to extract by flicking some switches in the settings menu. A shame then, as exploring its strange world and absorbing its bonkers story beats is a wonderful thing marred by dire fights.

Announced just today and created by small Brazilian team MadMozer, it's a first-person, multiplayer-focussed, Unreal Engine deathgame that traps you in a randomly generated mansion with a bunch of archetypal horror movie munsters - demon clowns, cursed puppets, toothy ghouls and hooded axe-murderers.

Whether you're charging off a power bank, topping up your VR controllers, connecting a phone to your laptop or hooking up your TV to a USB drive full of legally obtained video downloads, having a reliable cable that can do it all is incredibly handy. This one from Monoprice doesn't cost a lot either, as it has been discounted from $10 to just $3 for Black Friday. 
It's a fast option too, sporting 10Gbps data transfers and rapid charging at up to three amps. In fact, it hits the USB 3.1 Gen 2 standard (what a great naming scheme) and it's a simple, pocketable one metre or 3.3 feet long.

The LG 27GL83A and the slightly more expensive GL850 were the first two Fast IPS monitors to hit the scene, offering significantly better motion handling than IPS monitors up to that point - which excelled in terms of colour and viewing angles, but struggled with fast-paced action. Now the 27GL83A is back once again, and at a new low price - $200, a nice $100 reduction from its usual asking price.

Alongside animation studio Illumination, it had teamed up with Red Wing Shoes to make Mario’s shoes from the movie, not as a line of shoes for sale, but rather a hyper-realistic version of the boots – odd proportions and all – to be displayed at the official Nintendo Store in New York City.

People wanted to know more about them, which led Nintendo and Illumination to contact Red Wing Shoes, a Minnesota company specializing in work boots, about making some. “We got the call, and naturally, we’re like, ‘Well, Mario is the world’…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today in Big Numbers news: HP have launched a Black Friday sale in their own store, with a particularly mahoosive cut to the RTX 4080 version of their Omen 17 gaming laptop. It’s been struck down from £3800 to £2100 in the UK, a saving to the tune one £1700 – one very Big Number indeed. 
Another Omen 17 variant, still with an RTX 4080 GPU (but trading an even more powerful Intel chip for less RAM and storage), is also getting the Black Friday treatment in the US. Albeit with a $500 saving, which I understand is not as Big a Number, and is thus less deserving of going in the headline.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you are in the mood for a game about dancing around screens full of energy beams and projectiles, searching for that fleeting window of space in which you can stop and perform an attack, I recommend trying the demo for Ninja Issen. If you miss 8 or 16-bit platformers like Shinobi or the original Ninja Gaiden, I also recommend trying the demo for Ninja Issen. If you liked The Messenger - classique Ninja Gaiden's greatest heir - but wished it was More Cyberpunk with cheesy PG-rated holographic dancing girls and Comix Zone-style story panels, I also also recommend trying the demo for Ninja Issen. 


Out today, it's the work of solo Korean dev Asteroid-J, and based on the first level, is pretty decent. It does have quite a lot of dialogue for a ninja platformer, but the dialogue is tongue-in-cheek, and hopefully it'll fall by the wayside as you push beyond the tutorial sections.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the death throes of last December, I wrote about all the games I wanted to review in 2022 but eventually ran out of time for when we finally packed up the Treehouse for Christmas and took our annual turkey nap. It was quite a long list, all things considered, I will probably still end up making another one by the time this year's annual meat snooze rolls around, too. 2023 has arguably been stuffed with even more good games than we had last year, and I will be the first to admit that my eyes are, indeed, frequently too big for what I can feasibly hope to play in any given month.
But I also thought it would also be fun to get ahead of the game slightly by turning some of my remaining supporter posts for the year into a kind of extended I'M SORRY: 2023 Edition series, talking about games I have actually liked and played, but which a) didn't end up making it onto my personal GOTY list (just to keep you Advent Calender guessing gamers on your toes), and b) we also weren't able to review on the site, either due to lack of time, code or, well, no, it's really just time. Time is our eternal enemy. And the first game I'd like to talk about is Tron: Identity.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Subscribers to Nintendo Switch Online's highest tier, the expansion pack, have access to an ever-growing catalog of modern and classic games, including a small library of N64 games. In December, that expansion pack is expanding a little more, as Jet Force Gemini is coming to the service.
First released in 1999, Jet Force Gemini is a third-person shooter developed by Rare, the studio originally known for the Banjo-Kazooie games, but most recently known for Sea of Thieves. It's set on a sci-fi alien world, where players blast through hordes of insect-like creatures.
The most recent way players could experience the game on modern consoles was through Rare Replay, a compilation of classic Rare games released on the Xbox One in 2015.  For a refresher on the game, check out this 60-second rundown Rare put out a few years back.


The Switch Online currently includes 26 other N64 games, including the recently added Excitebike 64. It also includes Game Boy Advance games, Sega Genesis games, and DLC content for popular Switch titles, like Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and Animal Crossing. For the full list, check out our rundown here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the first ways Fortnite was able to prove its mainstream success was by introducing popular real-world people into the game. Whether it's Travis Scott, Lebron James, or Patrick Mahomes, it's become a sort of Hollywood Star of Fame to be featured in Epic Games' hit shooter. Today. Marshall Mathers joins the club – Eminem is coming to Fortnite. 
The Grammy winner will be added to the game's item shop on November 29. The image above shows the three versions of the rapper that will be available for purchase. From left to right, they're called Rap Boy, Slim Shady, and Marshall Never More. This release comes a few days ahead of Fortnite's Big Bang event, which is set to happen on December 2 at 2 PM Eastern. Alongside whatever world-altering event phenomena Epic plans to introduce, Eminem will be performing a live concert. Attendees will receive the Big Bang loading screen, featured at the head of this article.
Fortnite has been in gaming news a lot recently, thanks to the rollout of Fortnite OG, a record-setting new season that throws players back in time to the earliest maps in the game. It's also come under fire for new rules about which skins are allowed in certain creator-made worlds: you can see their response to this controversy here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mimimi Games have announced two chunky Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew DLC expansions - the German strategy game studio's final releases, before they close their doors for good.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Xmas season approaches, but for some of us, Halloween never ends. I've just finished (well, reached a grisly end within) the demo for Chiyo, a first-person horror game from Nimbus Games, set in Edo era Japan, in which you are a plucky young mystic sent by the Tokugawa Shogunate's Magical Arcane Division to investigate and cleanse a spooky abandoned mansion on the coast. 


Much like the protagonist of fellow Japan-set exor-simulator Ghostwire: Tokyo, you have a brace of occult, gesture-based powers with which to explore and, hopefully, vanquish any lurking spirits, but so far, the only ones I've gotten access to are a funky finger torch, the ability to unseal cursed doors, and the ability to see glowing puzzle props through surfaces. I very much do not feel like an Edo era John Constantine. I don't even feel like an Edo era Scooby Doo. I mean, at least he was good at running away: the titular Chiyo waddles about like she's worried her trousers are about to fall down.

My vote’s for a docking station: all it takes to turn this handheld PC into a functioning desktop is a few extra ports. Ports that are provided most gladly by the Syntech Docking Station, which thanks to Black Friday, is currently 20% off in the UK and 40% off in the US.

It's like watching somebody upend a bucket of termites over the world's most elaborate model trainset.
The associated Rise of the Dark Fog update is out on 15th December. Youthcat have put together a nifty announcement trailer that makes cunning use of the ability to raze factories from orbit - I'm curious to know if it was actually performed in-game.

The MX Keys S basically feels like the best laptop keyboard you've ever tried, with quiet scissor switches that are quick to operate with precision. The graphite colour scheme looks pretty neat too. 
At £85, rather than the regular £110, this is a pretty good value for a full-size wireless keyboard that supports both 2.4GHz wireless and Bluetooth, making it a good fit for Mac, PC and many more devices besides.

Why am I talking about a 2006 RTS? Because it just got a new official patch to make it run in 64-bit and fix a number of bugs.

That's because it's a Metroidvania platformer and, when it is time for back-and-forth combat, you're not choosing attacks from a menu. Instead you're stringing together combos in real-time, then when your alotted attack time is over, you're parrying enemy assaults with rhythmic flair. 

So, turn-based, yes, but with a twist. It's also out today.

Few manufacturers understand this better than Logitech, whose G915 Lightspeed Wireless keyboard has been the ideal way to type without tethers for years. It combines a slim yet robust build quality with wonderfully tactile keys, incredibly fast response times, respectable battery life, and a truly standout volume wheel. Perhaps for that reason, the G915 Lightspeed has also maintained its lofty price point, with an RRP of around £220. But as part of Amazon's Black Friday sale, you can currently grab the best wireless keyboard for almost half price. It's currently available for £125 in the UK, and $160 in the US, which is 46% and 36% off respectively.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The original Simpsons: Hit & Run, released 20 years ago in 2003, ended up being a massive hit and sold millions of copies. So a sequel, featuring planes, was planned. But then the publisher shocked everyone when it passed on a sweetheart deal to create more Hit & Run games.

And if £266 sounds like a high starting point for Full HD, consider that the Omni VX2728J is no budget monitor, sporting a 27in IPS panel that can overclock its refresh rate up to 180Hz. That’s one speedy screen, yeah?

        <updated>2023-11-21T14:32:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After four seasons of brand new content, Epic Games injected a healthy dose of nostalgia into Fornite Chapter 4's fifth season, officially called Season OG, by bringing back the Chapter 1 map for players to experience once more. Season OG has included weekly updates to add items from Chapter 1's various seasons, too, making it a fun romp through what Fortnite was like years ago. However, Season OG ends on December 2, which is also when Fortnite's next live event, The Big Bang, goes live. 
The Big Bang begins on Saturday, December 2, at 11 a.m. PT/2 p.m. ET, and Epic says, "This event marks a new beginning for Fortnite." 
✅ Unforgettable event

November 21, 2023
Before the event begins, Epic says players will see The Big Bang in the Battle Royale tile in the Discover section of Fortnite 30 minutes prior to its start; that way, you can jump in before the event starts to link up with friends and get your cosmetics in order. And speaking of friends, The Big Bang will support parties of up to four players. 
The Big Bang will be available anywhere you play the most current build of Fortnite, including PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC. If you won't be near a dedicated gaming device during the event, you can check it out using Xbox Cloud Gaming, Nvidia GeForce Now, and Amazon Luna services to play Fortnite via cloud streaming on your computer or mobile device. 
"To prepare for The Big Bang, Fortnite experiences made by Epic will be disable starting 12 p.m. ET on December 2," Epic writes in a blog post. "Creator-made experiences will remain enabled until downtime for Fortnite v28.00 starts at 11:30 p.m. ET."
While waiting for The Big Bang event, read up on everything you need to know about Fortnite Chapter 4: Season OG, and then read about how Epic says it's aware it missed the mark with a recent cosmetic restriction update for Fortnite.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CD Projekt Red released Phantom Liberty, the first and last expansion for its 2020 RPG, Cyberpunk 2077, in September. We loved it – find out why in Game Informer's Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty review here – and if you enjoyed the base game, it's not an expansion to miss. Currently, it's only available for purchase as an add-on to Cyberpunk 2077, but if you haven't yet picked it up, it might be worth waiting just a couple more weeks. That's because CDPR has revealed Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition, which includes the base game and the Phantom Liberty expansion in one single package.
Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on December 5, and will be released in both a digital format and physical. Check out the box art below: 
Big news… Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition arrives on December 5th in digital AND physical form for Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC!
#Cyberpunk2077 story as well as a new spy-thriller adventure in the #PhantomLiberty expansion in one package. 🔥 pic.twitter.com/IOBPCdTXFU
November 21, 2023
All that CDPR has shared about this new edition is the tweet above so it remains to be seen if the Ultimate Edition includes any new goodies or enhancements. Given Phantom Liberty and the Cyberpunk 2077 2.0 update improved the game in big ways, reworking and revamping several of its mechanics in the process, it's unlikely the Ultimate Edition will include any changes in that vein. Only time will tell, though. 
For more, read Game Informer's Cyberpunk 2077 review and then read Game Informer's Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty review. After that, read about the things to remember and know before starting Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty, and then check out this feature about how the team behind the expansion created its spy-thriller soundtrack. Read about this live-action Cyberpunk 2077 project that's now in the works, too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yakuza: Like A Dragon was a very silly game in spite of its dramatic narrative, but its follow-up, Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth, looks to give it a run for its money. Between letting Ichiban ride a dolphin and its Animal Crossing-style city-building mode, fans of the franchise’s goofball nature should be in for a treat, and a new batch of screenshots highlight this.
The images provide looks at Ichiban, Kiryu Joryu, and their returning friends, such as Nanba, Adachi, and Saeko, kicking butt in a variety of classes and looking absurd doing so. Other familiar faces will be playable party members for the first time, such as Seonhee, who is shown brutalizing opponents with a whip in the images. It's clear that Hawaii will never be the same once these guys are done with it. 


Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on January 26. You can learn more about the game and see it in action in this pair of trailers. Be sure to also read our review of its direct predecessor, Like A Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name, here.]]></summary>

The Talos Principle II often left me staring at my screen in awe. Sometimes, from sheer intimidation in the face of a seemingly formidable puzzle. Other times,  from my incredulous pride after unraveling said problem. But most of all, the experience regularly gave me pause as I pondered a philosophical idea or argument that challenged my viewpoints on the nature of existence and humanity’s place in the cosmos. These moments spurred me to solve the game’s 100+ puzzles in search of answers, and I’m largely satisfied with what I discovered.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Final Fantasy VII Rebirth arrives in February, which isn’t too far on the horizon, so Square Enix is getting players prepared with a cinematic refresher of its predecessor, Final Fantasy VII Remake. The company pairs that with a batch of fresh screenshots and art, including the first glimpse of the Highwind airship. 
The video sees Red XIII narrate the broad strokes of the 2020 adventure. While it doesn’t touch on the finer details and background of the characters, it provides a decent summary that's perhaps better served as a reminder for fans who played Remake rather than someone coming into Rebirth completely fresh. Unfortunately, the recap doesn’t touch on the events of the Intermission expansion that introduces Yuffie, who joins the party in Rebirth, so unfamiliar players will have to do their own homework on that. 


Square has released some new images, including a piece of art depicting Aerith in front of the Highwind. The screenshots show off the town of Kalm, the summon Kujata, the abandoned Mythril Mine, and a few side characters. Oh, and Chadley is there too. 

Final Fantasy VII Rebirth launches on February 29 for PlayStation 5. You can watch us play two demos of the game in this video and read our hands-on impressions here. You can also get the answers to some of Rebirth's burning questions in this interview with Square Enix.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Update, 11/20/23:
Last week, developer Epic Games updated Fortnite to include a new rating restriction that applies to certain skins. Depending on a Fortnite skin, it might only be useable on a creative island with a T rating, meaning the Resident Evil Claire Redfield skin, which features a pistol in a holster on her thigh, can't be used on islands rated less than Teen. Players were upset with this change as it made skins they paid real money for (often $10 to $20 per skin) unusable in all the ways they might have previously been usable. 
Epic said only 7 percent of Fortnite skins are only usable on Teen-rated islands, at the time, but it's clear enough skins are affected to have the community unhappy with this update.

Back in the '90s, Nintendo played faster and looser with its library of characters. Sometimes Yoshi showed up in The Legend of Zelda, and Kirby was whatever color he felt like at the moment, be it gray or pink. In 1996, that laissez-faire attitude was in full effect for the release of Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars for the Super Nintendo. Link, Samus, and even Donkey Kong (sort of) all had inexplicable cameos in the game, and one of my big questions about the remake was whether or not those would move forward.

Culex appears in Super Mario RPG remake as he did in the original game, which is to say he is a pixelated, 2D creature. He also features the original throwback soundtrack and sound effects. You access him the same way, too – by buying fireworks and trading them with the little girl nearby in Moletown for a shiny stone. You then use that shiny stone in Monstro Town on the locked door.

The new OLED models (one at 512 GB and another at 1TB storage) effectively replace the original release as the new Steam Deck flagship hardware. The older 64 GB and 512 GB LCD models are being phased out, while the 256 GB LCD will remain available at a reduced price.
Steam Deck OLED is not a fundamentally new platform. In many ways that matter, our review of the original still stands, and snagging one of the older LCD screen models is now an even more substantial value at the lower price. However, several of the concerns that surfaced in that review have been remedied by the new model – enough that a new evaluation is warranted.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this month, we launched a documentary called "Violence Is Inevitable: The Making of Humanity." And then, in a bit of a meta twist, we hung out with Humanity co-developer and publisher Enhance and discussed how we made our making-of documentary. Even cooler, we made a Game Informer level within Humanity – and you can play it now.
All this happened on the "HUMANITY Hub Community Stream," where myself (Blake) and Alex Van Aken discussed why we decided to make a documentary on Humanity, how we crafted the video, and even cutting-room floor content that didn't make the final product. We closed the show by putting our collective brains together to make a level based on the GI logo.
You can check out an archived version of the stream below:


By no means is our Humanity level an official partnership between Enhance and GI, but it's certainly a fun way to end a project that was a months-long labor of love. To play for yourself, either search via the name "GAME INFORMER FUN!" in the game's User Stages options or the stage ID: 013-020-5453.

By any measure, the PlayStation Portal is a very targeted and specific-use product, and it’s worth clarifying out of the gate: This is not a standalone console in any way. Rather, the Portal allows you to connect to a PS5 you already have in your home over your Wi-Fi network (or any Wi-Fi network) and play the games you have downloaded on that PS5 from other places around your home. You can also connect the Portal to other Wi-Fi networks outside of your home, though our testing found inconsistent results when doing so. Regardless of where you connect f…]]></summary>

The PlayStation 5 was the best-selling console of the month, too. 
Marvel's Spider-Man 2 taking the top slot last month isn't surprising – it's the fastest-selling PlayStation Studios game ever and sold through 5 million copies in just 11 days.


Behind Marvel's Spider-Man 2 on October 2023's best-selling list is Super Mario Bros. Wonder, the latest Switch exclusive from Nintendo at-the-time, and Assassin's Creed Mirage, the shorter throwback title from Ubisoft starring Assassin's Creed Valhalla's Basim.

It released Phantom Liberty, the first and only expansion for Cyberpunk 2077, debuted its soundtrack on streaming services, revealed plans for a live-action Cyberpunk project, and just this week, nabbed four nominations for The Game Awards 2023. Now, CDPR has announced it is working on a mod editor for The Witcher 3 that will hit PC sometime next year for free. 


"We're thrilled to announce that we're working on a mod editor for The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt," a tweet from the official Witcher Twitter account reads. "It will allow you to create your own experiences in the game by making something completely new or editing existing quests and content. We're planning on releasing it for free in 2024. Stay tuned – we'll have more to share next year."

Notably, CDPR says this mod editor for The Witcher 3 will allow players to create their own experiences in the game, meaning people can develop their own fantasy adventures starring everyone's favorite monster hunter. In a reply on Twitter, the official account confirms this mod editor will only be coming to PC.
If you haven't yet played The Witcher 3, you should and you can read about why in Game Informer's review of The Witcher 3.

The original Super Mario RPG, released for Super Nintendo in 1996, felt like it was meant to be your first RPG. In an era when Final Fantasy tried its best to tell mature stories within the medium's limitations and Dragon Quest demanded hours and hours of your time, Mario’s adventure felt much brighter and more manageable. Familiar characters, a lighthearted story, a reasonable length, and timed button-pressing during combat made it stand out against the competition. Revisiting the game more than 25 years later in this new remade shape shows the original formula did n…]]></summary>

"Digital Bros has reviewed its projects to align with the new competitive environment," it writes in a press release.

Persona 5 has become its own sort of mini-franchise within the Persona series. With many spin-off titles released over the years, such as Persona 5 Strikers, Persona 5: Dancing in Starlight, and Persona Q2: New Cinema Labyrinth, Atlus seems to love using Persona 5’s popularity to explore new stories and gameplay ideas. However, I applaud Atlus for making all of these spin-offs in completely different genres from each other. The latest, Persona 5 Tactica, delivers an entertaining story, a colorful cast of charact…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Another month, another batch of fresh games set to hit Xbox Game Pass. This time around, you can expect new games like Persona 5 Tactica and the console version of Dune: Spice Wars, as well as DLC and updates, and more. And, per usual, some games are leaving Xbox Game Pass this month. Let's break it all down below. 
Available starting today is Coral Island for Xbox Series X/S and Xbox Cloud gaming. Coral Island "invites players to be who they want and experience enchanting island living at their own pace – living off the land, nurturing animals, building relationships with a diverse cast of townsfolk, making the world around them a more vital and harmonious place."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lies of P is one of the year's best games – read why in Game Informer's Lies of P review – and both critics and fans have enjoyed the Bloodborne/Sekiro-style take on the story of The Adventures of Pinocchio. Mustakro on Twitter has taken their enjoyment of the game's boss designs and turned some of Lies of P's toughest challenges into Cuphead-style bosses, and it rules. 


I came across Mustakro this morning, scrolling through my Twitter feed, when I saw a really awesome rendition of Lies of P's King of Puppets boss (one of the most difficult in the game) in the style of Rubberhose, which is that classic animation style popularized in the 1920s seen in Cuphead.

Then I clicked through some of Mustakro's other tweets to find even more Lies of P bosses in the style of Cuphead, and I love these renditions so much that I just wanted to share. So, enjoy their other art below:

After that, read about how a September Lies of P update included various changes to make the game easier. And finally, check out these two new images teasing Lies of P DLC.

Call of Duty cycles through its lineup of villains on a yearly basis. Sometimes it's Nazis, other times it's Russian nationalists or zombies. But the most dangerous threat is one without a lust for brains or access to weapons of war; it's stagnation. And while many Call of Duty teams often switch up just enough variables to stave off monotony, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III fully submits to the annual churn.


Speeding ahead also impedes the storytelling since it barrels through beats at …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After months of character reveals, Tekken 8 has announced the final fighter of its launch roster: Reina. This brand-new character sports a lightning-quick moveset, earning her the nickname “Purple Lightning," and has mysterious ties to the Mishima clan.
Bandai Namco states that little is known about Reina's history besides she’s a student of the Mishima Polytechnical School. For some reason, she really wants to fight Jin (move over, Hwoarang), and based on her gameplay trailer, she seems more than capable of taking him on. Check Reina out in action below. 


With Reina’s addition, the 32-fighter roster is now complete. Here’s the full list of characters, with new fighters denoted and links to applicable articles/trailers:
Alisa Bosconovitch
Asuka Kazama
Azucena Milagros Ortiz Castillo (New)
Bryan Fury
Claudio Serafino
Devil Jin
Feng Wei
Hwoarang
Jack-8 (New)
Jin Kazma
Jun Kazama
Kazuya Mishima/Devil Kazuya
King
Kuma
Lars Alexandersson
Lee Chaolan
Leo Kliesen
Leroy Smith
Lili Rochefort
Ling Xiaoyu
Marshall Law
Nina Williams
Panda
Paul Phoenix
Raven
Reina (New)
Sergei Dragunov
Shaheen
Steve Fox
Victor Chevalier (New)
Yoshimitsu
Zafina
Additionally, the game's first Season of post-launch DLC will add four unannounced fighters. These characters will be released separately each season throughout 2024, with the first arriving sometime in the spring. 
Tekken 8 launches on January 26 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. Check our early hands-on impressions of the game here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Put your sleuthing caps on, detectives—it’s time to solve some mysteries! We are proud to announce that a whole batch of HeR Interactive’s Nancy Drew games are now ready for public testing:
In Nancy Drew: Stay Tuned for Danger, a soap opera star needs your help in uncovering who is behind a series of death threats that sound a little too real for comfort. 
Nancy Drew: Message in a Haunted Mansion has you helping out with repairs in a Victorian mansion. However, a series of strange accidents, plus some murmurings of a ghost haunting, quickly threaten to turn this renovation into an investigation.
In Nancy Drew: Treasure in the Royal Tower a failed ski vacation at an eccentric castle with even more eccentric inhabitants soon turns into a quest to uncover a lost piece of the history of the French Revolution.
And if you’re looking for something more thrilling, in Nancy Drew: The Final Scene, you will find yourself racing against the clock to find your kidnapped friend, while also saving a historical theater with more than a fair share of secrets from demolition.
The games are available for purchase through HeR Interactive’s website or Steam (Stay Tuned for Danger is not available on Steam, however). Or if you already own a CD copy of the games, their English and Russian variants will also work. To play them with ScummVM, you will need a daily development build. As always, if you encounter any issues, please submit a bug report to our issue tracker.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are very pleased to announce today the start of the testing period of two single-game engines: Kingdom: The Far Reaches and Escape From Hell!
Kingdom, was developed and released by Interplay in 1995. Only the DOS version of the game (available on gog.com) is supported. It's a cartoon FMV game, with an inventory, in which you have to guide Lathan Kandor through a medieval world, discovering the magic spells and the items required to defeat an evil wizard. 
Escape From Hell, was developed for Electronic Arts by the game veterans Richard Seaborne and Alan Murphy and was released in 1990. You play Alan in this keyboard-only Role Playing Game and visit Hell, looking for your girlfriend who was accidentally teleported there.
Both games use heavily hardcoded logic which is error prone and requires a lot of testing, so we need your feedback more than ever as they are both incompletely tested. There is sadly only one known demo for Kingdom. Support for the Windows and Mac versions of Kingdom may come later! Please contact us if you have some other demos of both games.
To play any of these games, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker and please take some screenshots along the way!
