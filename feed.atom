This includes the original The Sims which was released for PC, and the highly rated sequel, The Sims 2. Electronic Arts might have previously just left these titles to rot, but not anymore. It looks like The Sims and The Sims 2 are getting an official re-release.


Thanks to an update to the official website showing off a Sim from the original title with the interaction wheel from the sequel, plus a teaser with Plumbobs from both games, it seems as though EA will be putting these two games out to gamers everywhere. This, coupled with industry rumors that the release will be before the end of the month, seemingly confirms what fans have been asking for.

You can find the Monocle after you've unlocked the Dark Aether Nexus, a place that will be marked in the Main Quest guide for Pack a Punch. It'll require a significant amount of Essence, so try to rack in as much cash as possible. By Round 8, you must defeat a Shock Mimic to claim the Monocle for the Ice Staff Easter Egg.

These items have been popular ever since the game's launch, and some of them have incredible in-game effects. Of course, the worth of all GobbleGums isn't the same, and some are more popular than the rest. That said, there are new additions worth your consideration, which have been released as part of the Season 2 update.


How many new GobbleGums are in Black Ops 6 Zombies Season 2


So far, three new GobbleGums have been added on launch day: Dead Drop (Epic), Modified Chaos (Legendary), and Quacknarok (Whimsical). All three can be obtained from the Zombies round, but you'll largely have to depend on your luck to find these exact ones.

Given the scope of the allegations, narrowly focused on a single defendant, the action seems unusually punitive.

Allegations of destruction of evidence, obstructing service, and abuse of Nintendo's legal team, combine to make a dire situation even worse. But not for Nintendo.

Donkey Kong Country Returns HD swung onto Switch earlier this month and it's a perfectly good time. Nothing we haven't seen before, but still a good bit of fun. That is unless you want to play some of the later stages in co-op, it seems, because fans have discovered an oversight that sucks all the fun out of platforming with your pals (thanks for the heads up, GamingReinvented).
As shared on YouTube by the wonderfully named DK fan channel, Kong Kompendium, Returns HD has a problem with its co-op combat: two players can't bounce off the same enemy. It might not sound that weird on paper (heck, Mario does it all the time), but such an ability becomes pretty crucial as you progress into the game's later stages — where bouncing on enemies is the only way to proceed — making a full co-op run on Switch far from ideal.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sul sul!
The first two Sims games are still exceedingly well-regarded these days, but sadly, actually gaining access to them in a legitimate way isn't particularly easy. The first was a disc-only jobby, and the second has long-since been removed from digital platforms.
Thankfully, with a new report from Kotaku (thanks, Push Square) accompanying an intriguing tease from EA itself, it looks like The Sims and The Sims 2 will be re-released on PC very soon. The catch? Well, according to Kotaku's sources, it seems as though a console release is still "unclear" at the time of writing.

I am thankful that the handheld LCD graphics of the era did not allow me to witness my companion blob's amiable decline into shit-caked starvation. I am also thankful that my tamagotchi did not itself have a tamagotchi, because the only life principle I ever taught my tamagotchi was neglect. This is also the reason I may never play the reportedly pretty decent virtual pet game Yoke Heroes: A Long Tamago, whose developers 14 Hours Productions are defying God and Man by developing another virtual pet sim inside it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[WWE 2K25 has been announced by 2K, and three different editions will be available for players to pick from.


When it comes to structuring the different editions, 2K has gone with the tried and tested formula. The three editions offer different content at separate price points, and the correct choice will depend on your preferences.


Let's take a quick look at what each edition offers to help you make the best possible choice.


WWE 2K25 Editions explained


There are three editions to choose from: Standard, The Bloodline, and Deadman.


Standard ($69.99)



WWE 2K25


WWE 2K24 Standard Edition


Wyatt Sticks Pack



Deadman Edition ($99.99)



WWE 2K25


Up to 7 days of Early Access


Deadman Edition Bonus Pack


Season Pass


Wyatt Sticks Pack


15,000 VC


WWE 2K24 Standard Edition



The Bloodline Edition ($129.99)



WWE 2K25


Wyatt Sticks Pack


WWE 2K24 Standard Edition


Up to 7 days of Early Access


The Bloodline Edition Bonus Pack


Deadman Edition Bonus Pack


Ringside Pass


The Rock Nation of Domination Pack



Which WWE 2K25 edition should you get?


If you're a hardcore player who wants an unfiltered experience, The Bloodline Edition is the way to go. Sure, it might cost you a fortune, but you'll get a lot of extra goodies for the additional money spent. This includes every bit of future DLC content and bonus items that are available with the game.


If you're a casual player and just want to have a good time, opt for the Standard Edition. It's the cheapest available option, but you'll hardly realize the need for the extra content included in the Deadman and The Bloodline Editions.

Playtonic Games has released a new trailer for its upcoming Yooka-Replaylee remaster, reintroducing Shovel Knight as an NPC with unique new challenges for our heroes.
The character, based on the acclaimed 2D platformer of the same name, will receive a similar new coat of paint for the updated game, and will also come with a new and improved quest line. Based on the trailer alone, it looks like this will entail climbing atop a tower before booting a bunch of Shovel Knight-themed gems (some of which – or perhaps all – turn into enemies).

One of the biggest surprises that came with Nintendo's announcement trailer for the Switch 2 was the confirmation that the company would be holding a number of global 'Nintendo Switch 2 Experience' hands-on events for members of the public following its April Direct presentation.
You were free to file your application of attendance so long as you had an active Nintendo account, but the catch was that your place would only be granted via a randomly selected draw. Yikes. So naturally, then, social media is alight at the moment with users either elated at their confirmed attendance or somewhat saddened by Nintendo's denial.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's a faaaaake?
The enormously popular Pokémon Trading Card Game continues to attract huge numbers of players willing to pay vast sums to catch 'em all, especially rare cards. However, some detective work by PkmnFlyingMaster on EliteForum (thanks, VGC) suggests that prototype cards from the mid-'90s which first went up for auction last year could be fakes.
First, a little background. Prior to the debut of the Pokémon Trading Card Game in Japan back in 1996, the makers printed up prototype cards during the game's development. The rarity of these pre-release 'playtest' cards makes them highly sought-after and a significant cache of them went up for sale in 2024 having been verified by card grading company CGC. CGC highlighted how they worked closely with Takumi Akabane, one of the original designers of the card game, to verify the cards' authenticity.

Though it's been mostly out of the headlines for a little while now, the developer Avalanche Software is looking to change that through the official implementation of mods. A striking development, this, but it gets better.


Specifically, Hogwarts Legacy is due to receive official PC modding support via CurseForge on January 30, opening the more-or-less literal floodgates for community-made content. I'm not saying it's a huge improvement compared to the strangely humble Summer 2024 update, but it is a pretty darn big deal if we're being honest. The fact that it's all being accomplished via CurseForge, specifically, means modding will be easy and snappy, to boot, and content development will be driven thr…]]></summary>

The Tales series is one of those JRPGs that sometimes flies under the radar. It doesn’t typically get the same hype as Final Fantasy or Persona, but Bandai Namco has been consistently putting out solid Tales games for 30 years. Tales of Graces f Remaster continues that tradition, bringing one of the best entries in this franchise to modern consoles.
As the name might imply, Tales of Graces f Remaster is a port of a port of a game that first appeared on the Wii in 2009. That version only got a release in Japan, so those of us in the West had to wait until the PS3 English-language release in 2012 (which added the 'f'). Now, more than a decade later, the remaster of that port is a game that, for good and ill, looks and feels like it is from generations ago.

While team composition and character selection are undoubtedly important factors, understanding how to mix and match these effects can give you a genuine edge in battle.


How do Status Effects work in Arknights: Endfield?


Status Effects in Arknights: Endfield function off a Primer and Detonator system that requires using two tagged Skills.


To activate a Status Effect, you first need to apply an introductory Status, known as a Primer, to an enemy using a tagged skill. Primers are divided into two types: Physical and Elemental, determined by whether the skill used is Physical or Elemental in nature, which most abilities are.

That's in no small part due to its singular vision, which the former CEO and CCO Johan Pilestedt maintained. Now, though, he's off the project.


The silver lining is that Pilestedt isn't suddenly the centerpiece of a workplace drama. Instead, he's simply decided to take a sabbatical and do his own thing for a while. This may come as a big surprise to Pilestedt's many fans, as the CCO had grown very popular with the game's community, even when the going was tough. With that in mind, while it's plainly obvious that Helldivers 2 has been a team project from the very start, it was people such as Johan Pilestedt who brought the player base together, helping th…]]></summary>

        <updated>2025-01-28T11:17:54.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Abyssal Specter Rod is one of the seven new rods in Fisch, and you can obtain it as part of the Atlantis Update celebrations.


To get this rod, you'll have to gain access to the Ethereal Abyss region and solve the puzzle. Let's take a look at how you can get the Abyssal Specter Rod, and if it's worth your credits in Fisch.


How to obtain the Abyssal Specter Rod in Fisch


The first task is to solve the Ethereal Abyss clock trial, which allows you to gain access to the region (and the rod). You'll get 90 seconds to solve the puzzle and also require a friend. There are two rooms, and each of you will need to go to a separate room.


The puzzle is pretty easy to solve, but the two of you will have to coordinate. The person in the room on the left will have to click a button, and a corresponding symbol will show up to the player in the room on the right. This needs to be done three times, and the player inside the room on the right will find a clock with six symbols.


To solve the puzzle, place the three clock hands on the three correct symbols. To gain access to the Ethereal Abyss region, repeat the full puzzle three times. Once you gain access to Ethereal Abyss, the rod will be located inside, and you can obtain it for 1,004,269 Cash.




Is the Abyssal Specter Rod worth it in Fisch


The Abyssal Specter Rod costs a bit over a million in-game credits, and here are its in-game stats.



Lure Speed: 25%


Luck: 90%


Control: 0.1


Resilience: 60%


Max Kg: Infinite kg



Despite the lack of a passive, the Abyssal Specter is more than a decent rod. Its Lure Speed at 25% is a bit on the lower side (for a rod of its price range), but 60% Resilience and 90% Luck make it a worthy addition to your inventory.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Smell of the game.
Since Guilty Gear first arrived on Sony’s PlayStation in 1998, singeing the air with furious guitar shredding, it’s always been a head turner. While graphically, its goth-rock anime stylings have dazzled with each iteration, Arc System Works’ foremost achievement is in managing to differentiate itself from Capcom’s heavily aped fighting game paradigm. That said, with the series becoming so increasingly convoluted over the last 26 years, ostracising many a would-be player as a result, a redress of sorts was needed. It's here that Guilty Gear Strive steps in.
Strive remains tonally as it ever was: all-leather and metal; characters that sit somewhere between glam rock and BDSM fetishists; and a blaze of raucous, revved, spectacular battling.

It's sort of Journey for plague doctors, or possibly The Hobbit: Cosmodick Turpin Edition. I enjoy feeling the weight of those distant peaks upon my brain and eyeballs, but it's nice to fire up Kingdoms, the new free DD2 game mode that's launched just today, and have a choice of disasters to trundle toward.  


Over here is an inn being overrun by slathering beastmen. Over there is another, safer inn, but it's inconveniently perched behind a nest of tentacular cultists. In the middle there is you, with the customary DD party of half-dead, half-mad adventurers, equipped with an exciting smorgasbord of sharp edges, cursed artefacts, phobias and diseases. Let us proceed laughing and wailing to the launch trailer.

It's a single-button affair, having you navigate levels by alternating a pivot-point on a shape I don't know the name of so I'm just going to call a spinny stick.
There are moving background elements in some stages - in others, you make your own pace. Except I can't really make my own pace, can I Bauhaus Bonk? Because the swing soundtrack makes me feel like a plodding buffoon if I'm not responding with appropriate gusto. This is entrapment, game. I am devilishly compelled by swing, like a Reefer Madness extra.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Violent vermin.
After releasing the first Tails of Iron in 2021, developer Odd Bug Studio seemingly hasn’t taken a moment to rest, returning to its bleak world of anthropomorphic rats, frogs, and bats with a sequel that looks to offer fans a slightly expanded experience in Tails of Iron 2: Whiskers of Winter. And while it’s certainly an incredibly well-realised fantasy world with stunning visuals, atmospheric sound design, and thoughtful combat, it’s unfortunately also held back from greatness by lacklustre level design and excessive backtracking.
Presenting what may well be a good entry point to the world of Tails of Iron if you happened to miss out on the original, Whiskers of Winter shifts the perspective over to an entirely new protagonist called Arlo, an heir to the Warden of the Wastes who must travel to multiple biomes on a quest to defeat the malicious Dark Wings clan.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Smells like a stunt.
As Nintendo continues to take its good old time revealing details about its upcoming console, other companies have been quick to cash in on everyone's desperation for Switch 2 news. The price point is a key talking point right now and Italian site Games And Movies has taken a punt and put limited Switch pre-orders live for 364,99€.
The retail site doesn't put a date on the launch, instead carrying the 31st December 2025 placeholder, but it's the price point that has caught people's attention. 365€ puts the console at just 15€ more than the Switch OLED's RRP - the price you pay if you get the current model from Nintendo itself.

One of the biggest surprises of 2024 was undoubtedly Black Myth: Wukong, an action RPG from Chinese developer Game Science. Though not necessarily regarded as one of the all-time greats, it was certainly well-received and went on to sell an extraordinary amount of copies within a very short timeframe; reportedly over 18 million in just two weeks.
Naturally, then, this means that some sort of knock-off has inevitably appeared on the Nintendo Switch eShop, though the exceedingly blatant nature of this one has made it necessary for us to at least warn you not to fall for such shenanigans.

I know some of you are old enough to know what a letter opener is, or even to own one. Statistically, most of the RPS readership are Lich Lords. The Maw letter opener differs from regular letter openers in that when you open a letter with it, you will encounter not a letter but a perfect copy of yourself opening a letter in the opposite direction. The two of you must now fight to the death to decide who is the letter-opener and who is the letter. It's yours for a piffling three pints of any available body fluid, but if you don't want to buy a letter opener you can always buy one of this week's new PC games instead.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My favourite genre of YouTuber is: "person who hyperfixates on one mundane detail of a blockbuster video game and gets strangely poetic about it".  When you offer me a five-hour video essay about an obscure adventure game from 1998, I will hide in the closet. But if you idly wonder where the rivers in Skyrim go, I will follow along dutifully like a baby elephant. This is how I ended up spending much of my afternoon watching David Cage characters pissing. One video creator decided to painstakingly count every instance of playable pee time in cinematic adventure game Heavy Rain. This is vital work. This is important work.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A performance and settings guide for a ropey PC port of a Final Fantasy game? Sweet, I haven’t done one of these in four whole months. In fairness to Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, which Nic says can be great as a game per se, it does make some effort at settling into Windows. It has rebindable M+K controls. It has DLSS. It has generally more consistent framerates than FFXVI, which could bait you in with silky visuals before grabbing your head and shoving it into the cold ice bath of sub-30fps.
Yet it also steps back from that game on its supported tech, while raising its hardware requirements so far above Final Fantasy 7 Remake that it won’t even launch on a lot of older graphics cards. Even so, hitching and microstuttering issues from FF7 Remake return once more, along with plenty of other signs that this PC version didn’t get the love that a lot of other erstwhile PlayStation exclusives – like Horizon Forbidden West or God of War Ragnarök – did for their ports.

I don't make the rules, that's just how Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 explains the lack of elders in its very French yet very JRPG world. The fantasy game will see you journey across a dangerous landscape to stop the mad "paintress" who's magically culling humanity at younger and younger ages every year. We've been keeping a weary middle-aged eye on its development, and yesterday it got a release date. It's too late for most of us in the RPS treehouse. But watch the trailer for yourself, maybe you'll make it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The original Labyrinth was one of those movies that was such a precise product of its time, place, and the creative collision of the people working on it that it’s hard to imagine ever recreating the same ineffable magic of the 80's dark fantasy musical, or why you’d want to try. But that’s never stopped Hollywood…

It's out right now on Steam and Microsoft's Game Pass service. I'd say it has materialised from the darkness like a ninja, but there are a lot of ninjas in circulation at the minute, and my analogy-jitsu gauge is running dry. So instead, I'm going to say that it has materialised from the darkness like a resurfacing duck, its beak stuffed with pond vegetation. The pond vegetation, here, stands for "tweaks to the weapons upgrade system". Here's a trailer.

I get all excited about sharing details from a preview event for upcoming FPS Doom: The Dark Ages, then it turns out the gameplay reveal video is going public before the embargo anyway. Then the alleged release date allegedly leaks, allegedly. How am I supposed to present myself as a font of knowledge now, Id? Fortunately, we had a roundtable interview afterward with executive producer Marty Stratton and game director Hugo Martin. Sweet, job-justifying details!
Writing up the interview in full would involve typing out the words "awesome", "slaughter", "core pillars", and "iPod" more times than anyone realistically needs to read. Instead, here's a list of every detail I found interesting that isn't already covered in the showcase.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We called Amplitude's fiendish and fanciful strategy game Endless Legend the best 4X of 2014, and its hexcellence hasn't dimmed with age. "The music, the amazing variety in terrain and units, the sheer quantity of words bringing to life every last quest, minor faction, creature, and environmental anomaly," breathed a reverential Ollie in 2023. "It's a simply splendid game." Like somebody commenting on the sturdiness of an original Picasso's frame, I will only add that it now runs pretty comfortably on the current least expensive Dell Thinkpad.
Why in Meier's name would Sega choose to sell off the studio behind such a worldly wonder? The answer is lost in time (it's through that link, there), but fortunately, Amplitude endure as an independent - and they've just announced Endless Legend 2 with no less than Hooded Horse as publisher. Here's the announcement trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Assassin's Creed Shadows has a lot riding on it. Between its multiple release date delays in response to Star Wars Outlaws not selling as well as Ubisoft would've liked, and Ubi potentially being bought by Tencent as they clamour for help, there's a sense that Shadows needs to deliver not only a great game, but corporate redemption.
I've now played Shadows for four hours, having dipped into a bit of prologue action, some open world exploration, and a questline as both the hulking Yasuke and the lithe Naoe. Have Ubi delivered? I think there's a strong chance. What I played was a lot of comforting Creeding, carried along by a gorgeous interpretation of Edo Japan, and some subtle tweaks to up stealth stakes. Although I do think the two protagonists are a split personality that doesn't quite work for me.

If you were Edwin, Brendy, or myself - which, statistically, you are not - you were writing news articles about one of three aspirant spiritual successors to detective RPG Disco Elysium. It was an "I'm Spartacus"-ass day of press releases, culminating in the announcement of a project from former ZA/UM writers Argo Tuulik and Olga Moskvina.
Before that came sci-fi RPG XXX Nightshift, and before that was an unnamed "psychogeographic RPG" from newly formed Longdue. We now know that it's called Hopetown, and Longdue are set to launch a crowdfunding campaign which you can "pre-register" for here, should you wish. Here's the sell:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is billed as a faithful recreation of 15th century Bohemia, with an open world setting derived from primary sources and historical consultancy that seeks to "challenge misconceptions", but I'm enjoying it partly for the inconsistencies. As I amble into a random village, my eye is caught by what feel like carefully observed period flourishes: a particular arrangement of crops in a sloping field, a woman praying at a shrine by the gate. Some of these sights and sounds unlock codex entries, layering up the pedagogic texture.

Here is a compact selection of ski slopes, each one yodeling the promise of my smooth and exhilarating descent over fresh powder. But wait, someone has littered this Ski Sunday with obstacles, forcing me to run a gauntlet of trees, rocks and rivers. I am thrust headlong into each of these obstacles a dozen times before my withered synapses and tired bones internalise these arboreal teachings and I make it safely to the bottom.

As in life, there is joy to be found in this journey precisely because it is hard. Unlike in life, the camera is often facing backwards while you do it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Readers, I have spent two full days in the benchmark pits to tell you what you've already guessed: the GeForce RTX 5090 is very fast, too expensive, and laden with more AI tech than Philip K. Dick’s cheese dreams. At least two of those points will, I’m sure, send the average graphics card shopper running, especially at a time when even game developers are growing suspicious of generative AI and its many-thumbed, robot-voiced nostrums.
Yet while there’s not much to be done about the RTX 5090 costing at minimum £1939 / $1999, hundreds more than the infamously spenny RTX 4090, its suite of more purely performance-focused artificial intelligence tools is – dare I say it – quite neat. These range from Multi Frame Generation (MFG), which is basically DLSS 3 frame gen but up to twice as fast, to DLSS 4’s general upscaling enhancements and even the ability to apply newer DLSS versions to older games. All this will come to the rest of the RTX 50 series as well, with some trickling down to the enter RTX range, so maybe the RTX 5090 is best understood not as a practical GPU purchase in itself but as a Picadilly Square-filling advert for its more affordable siblings can do.

They are partnering with a game studio to create a playable adaptation of Macbeth from the point of view of someone examining Lady Macbeth's computer for dirt. Lili looks a lot like the interactive drama popularised by Sam Barlow's Her Story and Telling Lies. Except this has the added twist of being set in contemporary Iran. The game "will see Macbeth’s witches reimagined as hackers, with surveillance cameras and cyber-infiltration putting the player at the heart of the story..." Witchy hackers? I'm in.

A city-building game that takes place on small, post-apocalyptic islands, where the only way to expand is upward.

The decision to call it quits follows a bust-up within the development team, though this isn't, apparently, why they pulled the plug. Thorson and programmer Noel Berry have found making something "bigger and better" than Celeste exhausting, and have decided to work on smaller projects in future.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I can't get out. I'm trapped in a tractor full of beer and spare tires. I haven't taken a shower in days and a fly has gotten into the cab, buzzing around my ears, anticipating the feast that will come from my sweaty summer death. I just spent nearly an hour driving this tractor to the shop, buying car parts, and rumbling back in the dark. I took my eyes off the road for two seconds to turn on the headlights. It was a mistake. The road curved sharply and I went off a steep bank, tipping my tractor on its side. The door is stuck, the tractor's wheels spin helplessly. There is no recovering from this. I restart the game for the third or fourth time, not knowing whether to laugh or sob.
My Summer Car is as hardcore as they come. It does not simply throw you in at the deep end. It ties you up in a cloth sack with 50 kg of lug nuts and dumps you in the Baltic sea. "Sink or swim!" yells this game at you, but in Finnish, so even that you cannot understand. To a certain kind of person, this is an act of love.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This review contains some story spoilers for the original FF7 and subsequently some elements of Rebirth, but doesn't spoil how Rebirth ultimately reinterprets these elements. 
I argued with myself for several weeks in university about whether to go to a seminar discussing T.S. Eliot's The Love Song Of J. Alfred Prufrock. The poem meant enough to me that I didn't want to dissect it with a class. I wanted to keep for myself. I went in the end, and though I hesitated, I talked because I had things to say. It didn't kill the poem for me, but it does have a slightly awkward gait now, having never quite recovered from the incisions.
I now have to etherise Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth. Cait Sith is splayed upon a table. It's all scalpels, forceps, and oversized novelty dice. It's a strange way to treat art you love. The feeling I remember most from Rebirth on release is how grateful I felt to be alive to play it. Acute, active awareness of my own mortality with thoughts like "it would be properly shit if I died right now because I'd really like to see how this pans out". A personal 'never kill yourself' moment months before the meme gave voice, as the best often do, to an obscure and precious feeling.
An RPG where your character sometimes knocks on doors before opening them? What a time to be alive.

From your tower, you gaze down at four factions, each with their own members and complaints. If any one faction gets too large, they'll rebel against you. Luckily, you're very good at speeches, which you can use to blame all the realm's ills on other people. "It was the lion faction! They raised taxes!" you shout and point with one hand, holding a big bag emblazoned "taxes I done stole from the people" with the other. It worked! Now, the members from the other factions that are personally annoyed about taxes will come cull the lion faction down to a more manageable size. Bloody love a bit of politics, me!

Archetype Entertainment.
Summerfall appear to be prospering, but many of the studios founded by former BioWare devs have experienced hard times. In particular, Humanoid Origin and Worlds Untold have respectively closed and "paused operations" without releasing a single game. I'm raising a tentatively congratulatory glass, then, to Yellow Brick Games, a studio founded by former Dragon Age director Mike Laidlaw. The company's debut game Eternal Strands will release on 28th January, and there's now a PC demo.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Debate continues to rage on the internetworks about whether premium video games, and especially the ones with the largest budgets, need to have higher price tags. This time, the culprit is Matthew Ball of analyst firm Epyllion, who remarks in a sprawling State Of Videogaming 2025 report that "some gamemakers hope GTA 6 will be priced at $80-$100 [in the USA], breaking the $70 barrier and helping $50 titles to move up to $60, $60 to $70, $70 to $80, etc."
Picked up by VGC, these comments have now been circulated on social media, and have attracted the extremely polarised mixture of responses you're probably expecting. Among those chipping in is Larian's director of publishing Michael Douse, who makes the familiar argument that overall prices for games like GTA aren't necessarily higher today when you factor in economic inflation, while also acknowledging that up-front price alone doesn't explain the industry's recent mass livelihood devastation, and that few people would happily pay that much for a video game - not even Our Lord In Open Worlding GTA.

So it makes sense at least one other developer is looking to apply the same lo-fi principles to their own "hangout game". The simply titled Sledding Game looks like a chill afternoon of standing around on mountains with your mates and going for a big slide downhill every now and again. It's still early in development, as you can tell from the trailer below. But you'll be able to embody penguins, frogs, and polar bears as they drink hot cocoa in log cabins and ragdoll into one another willy-nilly. Other cute animals are to be confirmed, but I am putting my money on an dopey-faced ermine.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Steam are throwing a Real-Time Strategy Fest this week, encompassing discounts and demos, and people who like clicking on Orc-emitting huts are eating well. Of the new strategy game demos I've spotted so far, the one that interests me most is Calyx, in which you are at war with a mass of alien vegetation, which expands toward your base in a blossoming, suffocating avalanche of green moss and purple tendril. It seems a bit raw at the level of controls and performance, but the concept is very promising: basically, imagine if Creeper World 4 were a bit more like Ground Control. Here's a trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Capcom have declared that they hope to bring down the recommended PC specs for open world dinosaur-tipping simulator Monster Hunter Wilds, just a month before release day on 28th February, and a few weeks ahead of the final open beta. Much like an exhausted hunter applying a carving knife to the flanks of a steaming heap of Rathalos, they shall trim and whittle their prize to its essential organs - hmm, actually we never see the concluding butchery in Monster Hunter games, now that I think of it. You just waft your knife around dramatically while the slaughtered quarry peacefully disappears and chunks of dino component materialise in your inventory.

To wit: why have a lantern, asks FPS Mohrta, when you can have a horrible vulture-esque creature called a lantern beast that lives on your head to light up the dark for you? "Found a good'un," I wrote in Slack shortly after playing Mohrta's Steam demo. "It's so rad and strange!". Well, that's the pitch, reader. It's a "nonlinear FPS game blending action, exploration, and light dungeon crawling". Very rad. Very strange. Nom nom.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cyclopean: The Great Abyss appears to have glorious dungeon graphics but I can't say for sure because I can't get torches to work. I think your character is supposed to kindle them automatically when you venture into a dungeon - at which point the view switches, classic Ultima-style, from top-down into first-person. My character never deigns to light a torch, however. Possibly this is because, no matter how many torches I loot or buy from the underworld's infrequent traders, my character page always tells me I have none. Is my character eating them? Are they too afraid to light them and expose what those dungeons contain? Do I need to read the manual properly? Or is it just a bug?

News of the project was pieced together by mp1st from several LinkedIn profiles belonging to former employees of studio Thought Pennies. Different sources alternately describe the project as a “multiplatform, social role-playing game" and a "fantasy live-service RPG", although it's possible these refer to different projects from the same time period.

It has wrapped you all up, and it's going to be quite difficult to escape. Trailer below:

And now it has a bunch of new maps. Not content with making the powerful pew-pew 'em up completely free (WHAT), the developers have added new weapons, features and a further 30 bullet-pocked arenas. And look, an icy and divisive fan-made map of ye olde Counter-Strike appears among them.

The third host is Jon Hicks, with whom you may be less familiar, but he used to be my boss and thus may be considered the 5th Beatle of RPS. Anyway, go give it a listen.

It's a blend of tactical stealth and frenetic Hotline Miami spraying, and it just got a major update to add Steam Workshop support and a map editor.

On average, games protected by anti-tamper tech Denuvo enjoy 68 days crack-free before succumbing to piracy. Yet new research focused on MAME (Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator) and video game preservation, reveals that a sample of 712 protected games, released as far back as 1979, took an average of 10.6 months each to crack. Total cracking time: 628 years.

Telefonica's cooperation was to be expected, as it just obtained the rights to broadcast LaLiga matches for 1.2 billion euros. In contrast, details of an anti-piracy agreement between the two companies, one that seems to operate in the opposite direction, wasn't expected at all.

The standard practice when writing up such fan theorising is to walk you through it step by step, peeling back the layers like Inspector Clouseau. But I know that you are a busy person, so I will jam it all into a single sentence: a Twitter account purporting to be a Silksong developer has posted a tweet that seemingly predicts the Switch 2 announcement while using a profile picture of some cake taken from a recipe book that was published on 2nd April 2024 which is exactly a year before 2nd April 2025 which is the date of the Nintendo Direct teased in the Switch 2 announcement.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There’s a lot you can do with a third dimension. Texture. Nativity dioramas. Spheres. Hyper Light Breaker, in expanding from the 2D action of Hyper Light Drifter, chooses to almost entirely remake itself as a free-roaming roguelike, trading post-apocalyptic pixel art for big proc-gen vistas and even more acrobatic swordplay.
Its technical ambition, sadly, ends up undermined by the emptiness of its world, the lack of exploratory pleasure that Drifter nurtured so well, and combat that’s more faithful to the original yet doesn’t quite adapt well enough to 3D. Not to mention it has more than its fair share of early access bugs and, especially in the early stages, balancing missteps.

Lots of howling round these parts. 


You play a mother, Ro, whose son has been claimed by the Grim Reaper, or whatever they had instead of the Grim Reaper back then - this was, I think, prior to the invention of scythes? And cards? Anyway, while searching for Ro's son, you'll take part in grid- and turn-based battles against a regular cauldron of unspeakables, including disembodied raven heads and what appears to be a huge pair of subterranean lungs. Here's a trailer.

The company have cancelled two online multiplayer games, including one based on God Of War, according to a report by Bloomberg journalist Jason Schreier. Two different Sony-owned studios were recently told to stop development on their projects. One of those studios is Bluepoint, known for their work on the Demon's Souls remake. They were making the unannounced live service God Of War game, according to Schreier. The other studio is Bend, developers of open world zombie 'em up Days Gone. We don't know what they were working on, aside from the fact it was also to have a live service business model. In any case, both have been canned.

It means a lot to me, this photo. It's the precise moment I felt excitement shoot through my chest, a pang of "I can't believe I'm back". Then the next morning, a jolt that, in hindsight, definitely altered my brain chemistry. A wave of, "I finally get to disconnect and in many ways, I get to reconnect, too".

As with Deedlit - one of our favourite 'vanias - I’m drawn to it partly for the opulent real-time RPG combat, and partly because, to be very superficial, the protagonist is taller than I’m used to in games like this. Sometimes he feels too tall for the levels.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following the Republican victory in the US 2024 elections, several US companies have experimented with "pivoting away" from Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, a collection of employment practices aimed at challenging bias and prejudice in the workplace. Facebook owners Meta, Amazon, Walmart, McDonalds and others are reportedly scaling back their DEI initiatives to stave off backlash or litigation from conservative pundits and politicians, who regard DEI guidance about discrimination as a form of discrimination in itself. Following the election, I've also noticed a couple of video game company executives express misgivings about DEI - misgivings that, amongst other things, illustrate that "DEI" has come to mean a lot more than just annual training about micro-aggressions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been on a journey. About an hour into Minishoot' Adventures, I was ready to call this straightforward mix of 2D shmup and 2D Zelda mediocre. My mind had been changed long before I beat the final boss, by which point I thought it was good, but I still felt that all the people praising it at the end of 2024 were singing so loudly only because it was good and short and obscure, three things which in combination are easily mistaken for greatness.
Then I pushed past that final boss, mopping up the remainder of the map, and in that last 25% I think I fell in love. Minishoot' Adventures is straightforward in concept, but its execution is a masterclass of craftsmanship.

The mod in question is the GTA 5 Liberty City Preservation Project, a six year project that rebuilds GTA 4's Liberty City in GTA 5's world. It launched earlier this month - and now it is no more, for Rockstar have descended like briefcase-wielding peregrine falcons and performed what is being called a "friendly takedown" on modding team World Travel. My brother did a "friendly takedown" on me once, and my elbow still doesn't bend the right way.

Its redesigned, more sculpted controllers. Clearly, this is a naked attempt at ripping off and cashing in on the real best gaming handheld of 2025, the Steam Deck.
I, for one, won’t stand for it. Here are five reasons why everyone excited about the Switch 2 is wrong, and should buy a Steam Deck instead. Or maybe the Steam Deck OLED, that one’s better.

Animal Well, which turned damn near every games journalist into a tiresome obsessive? Not nominated for anything. UFO 50, an impressive, important, big boy achievement snubbed by our own 2024 list? It did get a Grand Prize nomination. 

I don't disagree with any of the nominees or absences in this year's Independent Games Festival Awards, so I don't mention any of the above to stir up trouble. Instead I look at this list and think: wow, video games are more varied than ever, so much so that there's no longer a dominant cultural narrative even within the specific niche of indie gaming.

On the one hand, as a fan of weird forests, which is to say all forests, I'm keen on the prospect of an FPS set in a post-apocalyptic Paris that has been overrun by sentient, pissed-off trees. It's from a team led by a former S.T.A.L.K.E.R. developer, too, and those S.T.A.L.K.E.R. alumni certainly know how to post a good apocalypse. On the other hand, the announcement video suggests a game in which you will mostly treat the frenzied flora as a source of "emergent" cover and terrain traps. Have a look.

I wonder how long it'll take them to probe beyond the obvious Marvel headliners and start seriously abrading the bottom of the Connected Universe barrel. Nagneto, for example. Or how about J.

OK, how about when you were a kid and you lifted up a nice, round stone and the damp, fertile soil beneath writhed away from you in a fervent knotting of pellucid, boneless bodies and the tickling of a thousand little legs?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A quick one: Firaxis have confirmed that Civilization 7 will be Steam Deck verified at launch. It's a pleasant surprise, given that 2016's Civ 6 is still only listed as "playable" on Valve's oversized Switch. I like this news about as much as I'm terrified to realise that Civ 7 is just under a month away. I do not need that much strategy game, this early in the year. But hey, at least I'll be able to play the new 4X in bed as Sid Meier intended.

As reported by 404 Media, this follows several reports on the game's forums and social media from players who'd had their inventories emptied of rare items.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new report has thrown fuel on the fire labelled "Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion remake". Don't ask me why people have started labelling fires. It's probably a rite to summon a Daedra, or something. Anyway, a new version of Bethesda's somewhat scorned 2006 RPG is allegedly in the works at Singapore-based Virtuos. If rumour speak true, it's being made in Unreal Engine 5, and will feature changes to core systems like blocking, stamina, and sneaking.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["Coming off Turbo Overkill has been great," Trigger Happy's Sam Prebble tells me over call. "That game's development... I mean, it worked out. But it was very messy because it was my first game and I didn't know what the hell I was doing. So I found myself, when it came to pumping content out, I was like: oh, shit. This code base is fucking awful. Like, I can't put stuff together easily. I'm running into bugs everywhere. But now shit just works!"
You might know Sam Prebble as Trigger Happy Interactive, the solo developer behind frenetic FPS Turbo Overkill. Before that he went by a different name, attached to a very different project. Total Chaos, first released in 2018 under the moniker Wadaholic, is a total conversion mod for Doom 2. With its focus on a thick survival horror atmosphere of tension and disempowerment, it's about as far removed from Turbo Overkill's manic, Doom Eternal-inspired action as a game can get. As Prebble puts it, the only thing the two projects have in common is the first person perspective. Even so, he found himself returning to Total Chaos after wrapping development on Turbo Overkill, resulting in the standalone remake.

S úctou a upřímnou pokorou jsem přistoupil k aranžmá národní slovenské hymny "Nad Tatrou sa blýská" již v roce 2016. Hudebně vychází z původní lidové písně a již dávno zažité sestupné basové linky původně inspirované čardášem. V monumentální instrumentaci zaznívá důstojné a bohaté "hradní" Maestoso s výraznou smyčcovou figurací a dramatické Presto s vypjatým protihlasem tak kontrastně jako dunajské nížiny a Vysoké Tatry. Důvodem vzniku bylo hledání krásy a síly slovenské hudby s duchovním nadhledem mně tolik blízké mahlerovské angažovanosti. Velmi důležitá při tom pro mě byla noblesa a hudební kultivovanost při zachování původní písně. Nový rozměr je u mě h…]]></summary>
