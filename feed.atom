        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Don't waste your Sterling on this.
If you’ve been keeping tabs on EA’s hugely popular football franchise, you’ll have heard that FIFA 23 marks the end of an era. As the final game to carry the FIFA licence before EA parts ways with its partner of 30 years, most multiformat sites have been discussing FIFA 23’s importance as the finale of a long-running series, at least in terms of branding.
For Switch owners, however, this is old news. People can harp on about the end of an era all they like, but as far as Nintendo players are concerned the FIFA series died half a decade ago. What we’ve been getting since then is the video game equivalent of ‘80s comedy Weekend at Bernie’s, with EA propping up the corpse of FIFA 18 on a stick and jiggling it around in the hope that people will believe it’s still a living, breathing entity.

Retired game developer Kevin Edwards has recently been taking to Twitter to share his experience of the industry in the 1990s. While these posts certainly provide a deep dive into the intricacies of building a video game, so too do they demonstrate the trials involved when the development team is placed under high pressure and restrictive deadlines.
One such post has been unpacked by the good folks over at Time Extension, in which Edwards shares a less than forgiving fax concerning the 1992 SNES title, Spider-Man and the X-Men in Arcade's Revenge. Sent from Arcade's Revenge publisher, Acclaim (via its LJN label), the note details what changes needed to be made to the superhero platformer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Guerrilla Tactics
A strange, yet unsurprising, sprang forth to the information superhighway this weekend, with several sources reporting that Sony Interactive Entertainment is in the process of creating a PS5 remaster of Guerrilla Games' epic 2017 release, Horizon Zero Dawn.
First reported by MP1ST, with various industry pundits and websites supposedly corroborating the news, the remaster will be an updated and upgraded take on the anachronistic sci-fi adventure, which saw hunter and tribeswoman Aloy venture out into a lush land of dangerous machinery on a quest of reflection and self-growth. Originally launching on PS4, the smash seller would eventually make the leap to PC in 2020.
While details are understandably slim — even unproven — on the supposed remaster, one can likely expect improved load times, upgraded textures, improved accessibility options, and slicker visual effects, perhaps bringing the title more in line with its utterly stunning sequel, Horizon Forbidden West. We can likely look to similar PS5 remasters, such as The Last of Us and Marvel's Spider-Man, for examples of some of the improvements SIE will be striving for in this new release.
In addition to the remaster, the MP1ST report also claims that Guerrilla Games is currently working on a multiplayer side-title set within the Horizon universe. The alleged project is currently in the early stages of development for PS5 and PC, and will see a conflict between the world's various tribes, with gameplay defined by some form of PvP or co-op multiplayer element. Given the success of the Horizon titles to date, it figures that SIE would be looking to capitalize on the series' growth via numerous projects.
The gaming industry will not rest until we are all playing the exact same four games ad infinitum.

Earlier this year, it was announced that Nintendo would be acquiring the visual production company 'Dynamo Pictures, Inc.' and subsequently rename it 'Nintendo Pictures'. Well, it looks like the acquisition has now been finalised and Nintendo has launched an official website for its new branch.
As previously stated, Nintendo Pictures will be focusing on "producing visual content for Nintendo IP", though what exactly this will entail is up in the air at the moment. On the website itself, Nintendo has left a short message which sort of gives a bit more detail, but it's honestly all a bit vague.

The Connecticut District Court dismissed Yout's request to declare the service as non-infringing.

It's autumn (or fall depending on what term you like to use for the crispy leaves season). The nights are drawing in. The temperature is dropping. And the holiday season is fast approaching — we know, we're sorry. But that does mean there are lots of video games coming our way, and you need to know which ones are the best that you can grab from the eShop.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["You get used to it, I don't even see the code".
In a series as focused on multiplayer as Picross S, it’s always seemed odd that Nintendo and Jupiter haven't allowed more than two players to be playing at the same time. We’ve lost track of how many times we’ve played Picross on our Switch during a major social event and could only have one other person participating, while everyone else in the room simply had to stare on wistfully and wait their turn. Lucky for us, the technology has finally been developed to allow for up to four players to play at once. This means that Picross S8 is at least twice as good as the last several games.
The basic premise this time around follows blue and red cursor who discover that their parents, green and yellow cursor, have broken out of prison and are dead set on getting revenge for being framed by their children. See, there are even four characters! You do have to fill in all of the gaps yourself—there isn't a single line of written or spoken dialogue anywhere nor are there any cutscenes after all. We're entirely joking, of course--but with four players, there's plenty of opportunity for gut-wrenching plot twists and payoffs that have been years in the making with your friends and family.

Wish I was there to warm you up.
For now, however, it is the weekend, and I hope that yours is filled with happiness, joy, good food, good friends, and video games. And if you are working, then I hope you have a smooth shift, and are able to make the most of the time which you do have to yourself — perhaps later this evening, or tomorrow. Either way, treat yourself this weekend, whenever you are able to, and be kind to yourself, always.

Retro publisher Hamster just can't get off of its Namco kick at the moment. This week's entry to its classic-filled Arcade Archives is one of the developer's lesser-known arcade releases. Now available to download on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, it's Namco's futuristic tank battler, Assault.
Released to the Japanese arcade scene in 1988 under the title "Akeaka Assault," before trundling west under its simpler, localized title, Assault is a future-set top-down shooter that puts the player in the driving seat of an intergalactic tank, and tasks them with bringing down their planet's colonizers in a uniquely dark narrative — and one that is surprisingly prescient to modern eyes... 
In Assault, you play a native warrior of a far-off planet, who starts out upon a one-man rebellion again…]]></summary>

Today marks the 15th anniversary of NBA Live 08 on the Wii. Quite why there wasn't a national holiday and organised street parades for this excellent game is beyond us. Except, of course, it isn't excellent at all. The game was, for all intents and purposes, objectively bad, and yet there is a very large part of this writer which has an unabashed fondness for it, regardless of its flaws.
Now, this got us thinking — what are our favourite games which everyone else seems determined to say are bad? There's no room for the phrase "guilty pleasure" here — after all, if we like them, then why should we feel guilty about it? — but we are operating along the same lines.

After two years in Early Access, it's time to check back in with Grounded now that it's been fleshed out with more bugs to battle and harvest, more impossibly large backyard sights to seek out, and a fully realized story — complete with an eventual ending — to uncover.
Having only dabbled in the early build, back when there were hardly any threads to follow, I'm surprised how far Grounded has come thanks to ongoing updates and a big final push for the 1.0 launch on PC and Xbox.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Double, double, toil and trouble.
Coming from developer MassHive Media, Potion Permit is a sweet little social sim-meets-adventure RPG. However, unlike the majority of life simulators currently dominating the eShop, Potion Permit presents no crops to cultivate and no farm animals to tend to, and instead relies on medicinal foraging to help those around the town, which may be a welcome change of pace for life sim fans who've had their fill of farming.
Potion Permit immediately thrusts you into the role of the village chemist. You've been called to Moonbury through a special request sent by the mayor, so you must accept. But upon arriving, the town's citizens turn a cold shoulder toward you and won't explain why. So even though you're quickly whisked away to a private neck of the woods and instructed that it's your sole purpose to heal the townsfolk of any number of unlikely illnesses, the game focuses on the distaste toward the capital and its chemists and requires you to prove yourself.

We did it folks! We made it through the barrage of game releases — more commonly known as 'September' — and we live to write another day! Though October is looking just as packed... *gulp*
Here at Nintendo Life, we've played through the unofficial Super Mario Bros. 5 fan game made entirely in Super Mario Maker 2, gotten silly with life sims and lauded Lord of the Rings RPGs of old. It has also been an exciting week as we found out not only that Cuphead would be getting a physical release, but we got our first look at Pokémon Scarlet and Violet's newest 'mon Wiglett — he's quite the weird little fella!

One of the returning characters in the upcoming release Fire Emblem Engage is Marth. This character originally debuted in 1990 and has made multiple appearances since then even outside of the series. In the new mainline Fire Emblem, Marth returns as a legendary hero.

Earlier this week, the Switch received the Anniversary Edition of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. As amazing as it is to finally have this particular version of the game on Nintendo's hybrid system, it seems some players are encountering performance issues.
A number of Skyrim Anniversary Switch users are reporting frame rate issues - including stuttering and frame rate drops. Others are supposedly experiencing crashes more regularly now, with a lot mentioning how they've been playing the game's Survival Mode. Here's a look at one of the videos blowing up on the Nintendo Switch subreddit at the moment:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's a waiting game
Anyone who's been into games for more than like a day knows how long the wait can be for our favorite titles to release. Game delays are a dime a dozen these days, but for some fans, the wait is so long, you start to wonder if you'll ever get to see the Promised Land. While the development cycle can be anywhere from a year or two to six or seven years at most, there are some games out there that we've been waiting much, much longer for. One of those games is Beyond Good & Evil 2, a long-awaited sequel to Ubisoft's beloved classic. It's been so long since the game was initially teased at Ubidays 2008, in fact, that the title is considered the longest-awaited AAA game of all time.
The previous record-holder in this regard was Duke Nukem Forever — players had to wait over 14 years from its announcement in 1997 to its release in 2011 (or 5,156 days, to be exact). We've now been waiting 5,236 days for Beyond Good & Evil 2 as of the writing of this post, and it doesn't look like we'll be getting any updates any time soon.
Ubisoft did release a full trailer for the game at E3 back in 2017 that looked pretty good, but I guess it would have been a pretty bad omen if it didn't considering they had supposedly been working on it for nine years at that point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsoIUHDrPcg
Some Reddit users have pointed out that we wait so long for some games that they become something of an urban legend. Beyond Good & Evil 2 certainly fits the bill there, along with Half-Life 3 and whatever project Ken Levine is supposedly working on.
Part of me wants to respect whatever difficulties are likely going on behind the scenes to draw development out this much, but another part of me is so beyond curious to hear about any development drama. Oh well, if it's anything interesting, Jason Schreier will probably write a book about it eventually.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rowing Blazers, a New York-based clothing brand, has announced a new line of Sonic the Hedgehog apparel. The collection draws inspiration from Sonic's aesthetic from the 1990s, with graphics inspired by art from the time. 
Those who are interested in the collection can look forward to clothing items like a cotton sweater with Sonic's image, a zip-up polar fleece, heavyweight rugby jerseys, a French terry loopback hoodie, cotton tees, and mesh shorts. The line also includes baseball caps, canvas tote bags, a necktie, and a hand-embroidered Sonic patch for blazers and other clothing items.
You can see a gallery of some of the items in the collection below.

According to Jack Carlson, founder and creative director of Rowing Blazers, which has done collaborations with FILA, Umbro, the NBA, and more, the company's creations all hold important links to his personal life.
"A lot of it has to do with the things I loved growing up: the sports, the brands, the culture," he said in a press release. "I grew up in the '90s playing Sonic the Hedgehog on the Sega Genesis. Sonic has always been such an interesting character to me. In the original games, he was a little bit brash, a little bit punk. He was different from other cartoon and video game protagonists. He was very '90s. Of course, there have been a lot of Sonic clothing capsules created over the years. I wanted to do something elevated, really beautifully made, and kind of timeless in its aesthetic. Of course, there's a kind of irony to it because Sonic himself isn't really very preppy, but that's the fun of it."
The collection retails as low as $38 to $325, though nothing is currently listed at the higher end of that spectrum just yet. The collection is live now, having launched yesterday. If you'd like to check out the collection for yourself, you can head here.]]></summary>

The team behind Dragon Age: Dreadwolf is giving fans a taste of the lore awaiting them in the new RPG. The writing team has shared a handful of codex entries from Dreadwolf, as part of a community update on the next Dragon Age.
In a BioWare blog post, the team behind Dreadwolf runs down the basics. As it says, stories and characters are at the core of BioWare games. Each person has their own motivations, and each entry has its own hero, molded by player decisions.
Creating a world that's interesting to role-play in, then, is pretty important. And that's what today's codex entries tease out. Dreadwolf will set out for the Tevinter Imperium, an old and powerful region ruled by a host of mages.

This codex entry discusses the Grand Necropolis,…]]></summary>

Let's start with a question: Why are you here? Of all the many games launching in the latter third of 2022, this is perhaps the most dependably, dryly predictable in form and function: a Let's Sing game featuring songs by Abba. Sure, you might be curious about the playlist or the various modes in this particular entry of the long-running karaoke series, but as video games go, this particular quantity is about as 'known' as they come.
Perhaps you're here for the same reason we said 'yes' to review code: sometimes you just need something reliable and restorative. Times are tumultuous and the unexpected offer of a night in belting out some bangers with friends and family in a no-stakes, low-stress environment sounds like just what the doctor ordered. For hardened gamers, there's no worrying about avoiding spoilers online or impaling yourself on a difficulty spike with Let's Sing Abba; it's as wonderfully low-maintenance and uplifting as you expect it to be.

NieR: Automata was first released in 2017, just close enough to the Switch launch date that it could have helped define the console's larger identity. It's definitely a "Style over Horsepower" game, and did little to tax the hardware of the now last-gen PS4. It's also developed by PlatinumGames, who've done a lot to build their audience on Nintendo consoles in recent years. Between The Wonderful 101, the full Bayonetta franchise, and Astral Chain, the Switch is where the bulk of their character action games live now. That's another reason why it's felt a little weird to see NieR: Automata on every major platform but Switch for all these years, but then again, weird has always been Nier's thing.
Now the game is finally headed to Switch on October 4, 2022, and I'…]]></summary>

Boutique retailer Limited Run Games, not content with merely offering up physical games, toys, clothes, and soundtracks, has decided to get into the world of the printed word, with the announcement of a new book publishing arm, Limited Press Run.
The new endeavor, which is led by Limited Run writer Jared Petty and media researcher Jeremy Parish, will see Limited Press Run publish a range of books based on video games and game-adjacent topics. Hitting the ground running, the new outlet has already released its first three tomes, which focus on various aspects of retro gaming — a topic that is obviously close to Limited Run's heart.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To be this bad take AGES
Following up on its previous interest in the controversial and highly unstable blockchain market, Sega has announced that it is partnering with a Japanese developer to publish its first blockchain video game.
As reported by 4Gamer and VGC, the untitled release will be a new entry in Sega's strategy series Sangokushi Taisen — a hybrid coin-op/card game franchise — based upon the legendary Romance of the Three Kingdoms folklore — is popular with Japanese arcade goers but is something of an anomaly on western soil. Sega is allowing studio Double Jump Games to license the Sangokushi Taisen IP for its new blockchain project, utilizing the company's "Oasys" technology. Details are sketchy at this juncture as to what form the blockchain element will take, but characters and artwork from the series are likely to be part of the collectible process.
As you have likely read about, here and else, the blockchain and NFT market, allows for the creation of artwork, icons, items, and other tokens to be stored in an online capacity, with ownership rights to be bought, traded, and sold. While the past year has seen all manner of franchises and companies swiftly declare their love for the new tech, the market itself has proven incredibly unstable, leading to huge losses in revenue, stolen "ownership" of items, and artists' work stolen and "resold" in NFT format.
In addition, video game companies trying to implement blockchain/NFT technology into their titles have often backpedaled in the face of criticism and derision from their respective communities. For more information on how NFTs and blockchain technology is attempting to become part of the mainstream gaming market, you can check out our previous feature by Jonathan Holmes.

Earlier this year, a Nintendo worker filed a labor complaint against the company. Now, we're getting more details on the allegation that Nintendo's dismissal of the worker was over a labor inquiry.
The labor complaint was filed earlier this year against Nintendo and contracting company Aston Carter. It alleges the companies violated the legally protected right to discuss unionization without fear of retaliation.
In an interview with Axios, the worker is coming forward as Mackenzie Clifton. The tester alleges they were fired in February, over a question about unions during a Q&A portion of a meeting.
In this company meeting for Nintendo testers, during a Q&A with Nintendo of America president Doug Bowser, Clifton says they ask…]]></summary>

Publisher: Square Enix
Released: September 29, 2022 (PS5 & PS4) / November 11, 2022 (PC)
MSRP: $59.99

Let’s not beat around the bush on this one: Valkyrie Elysium is not a good game. Outside of one specific enemy design, there isn’t a single thing I like about it. Not the characters, not the graphics, not the story, not the level design, not the world-building, and no, not even the combat. From top to bottom, this is about as mediocre of an action RPG title that you’re going to find on the market, one that would arguably be passable if it were rus…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fashionably Late
Today was supposed to see the release of the physical edition of Sega's witchy classic Bayonetta on Nintendo Switch — But European fans of the lollipop-chomping gunslinger have come unstuck at the last minute, with Nintendo announcing, on launch day, that it is delaying the release in UK and Europe.
"We are now aiming to release the physical edition of Bayonetta in the first half of October, exclusively on My Nintendo Store," reads a very succinct message from The Big N. "Please stay tuned for more info. We apologise for any inconvenience caused."
While hardly the end of the world, the launch day delay for Bayonetta in Europe and the UK will no doubt further the ire of Nintendo fans in those territories, who are already smarting from another distribution problem earlier in the year, when fans were informed that the collector's edition of Xenoblade Chronicles 3 was delayed due to "unforeseen logistical challenges". To date, said collector's edition is still unavailable to order in both Europe and the UK.
Meanwhile, the long-awaited sequel, Bayonetta 3, will launch on Nintendo Switch October 28.

Many of the devs I spoke with have had no communication from Google at all since the announcement, with only one saying the company had been in touch. It's not just devs who have been left in the dark, though. Through a leaked internal email sent to Google’s Stadia team, even Google's own staff weren’t briefed until around the same time the public were made aware of the forthcoming shutdown.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Get busy living, or get busy dying
Publisher Krafton has released a brand new trailer for its incoming sci-fi horror title The Callisto Protocol, teasing up further gooey 'n' gory action ahead of the title's release on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox this December.
As a quick refresher, The Callisto Protocol is developed by Striking Distance Studios and hopes to capture the unsettling terror and visceral horror of nerve-jangling franchises such as Alien and Dead Space. Set within the walls of a desolated, intergalactic prison complex — Black Iron — The Callisto Protocol follows the unenviable escapades of a party of investigators who find themselves lost within the aftermath of some terrible event, rendering the prison, and perhaps the entire planet itself, a viral, mutant-filled, living nightmare. What caused this whole abomination? It's your job to find out.
Oh, and if you live to tell the tale, that would be useful too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yf_mXDPAKw
As protagonist Jacob Lee, players will explore Black Iron and its surrounding, fending out a grotesque army of twisted guards and prisoners with an arsenal of melee and ranged weaponry. As Jacob picks his way through the cells, corridors, and execution chambers of space jail, he will slowly piece together the clues pointing to what exactly happened on Callisto moon and, with any luck, find a way to stop it. The Callisto Protocol is looking suitably creepy, incredibly gory, and worth a spot on the radar of any survival horror fan.
The Callisto Protocol launches on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms December 2.

Beatrix LeBeau has packed up her slime-wrangling gear and has crossed the Slime Sear to Rainbow Island, a new land packed with new mysteries and new slimes.
As a seasoned slime wrangler myself, I was excited to dive head-first into this new, colourful world. Review code didn't arrive until launch day unfortunately, but all week I've been vibrating with anticipation. After spending a handful of hours frolicking with slimes and skipping around Rainbow Island, though, that early dazzle is starting to wear off. Monomi Park’s sequel feels a little too familiar to its predecessor in its early game, and it's put a major downer on my goo-hoovering adventures.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Out Of Hands is a fairly "does what it says on the tin" title for this, a game where you play a dude who dreams he is made entirely out of hands every night. It also operates as a decent joke, because rather than being out of hands, he, if anything, has too many. So full marks for the name. The game itself is kind of a deckbuilder but not really, and though it also describes itself as a thriller, I can't say my heart rate was raised. In fact, behind the (admittedly very cool) visual style there seems to be a pretty run-of-the-mill "a girl I liked is no longer in my life and I'm pretty cut up about that" story. I guess in the full game it might turn out she was murdered, or she mudered the main character, or the main character murdered her - just, some kind of murder, maybe?
But in the four demo levels I played recently, it seemed like a pretty normal breakup. I was really excited to give it a go, but in the preview I didn't find the contrast between a face made of squirming hands and the well trodden women-be-leavin' plot to be particularly affective or evocative. The squirming hands are cool, though.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Through the Dragon's Eye
Activision Blizzard has announced a release date for Dragonflight, the newest expansion to its iconic fantasy MMO World of Warcraft — the new content will be made available to all players on November 28.
World of Warcraft: Dragonflight, like the many, many WoW expansions that have come before it, will welcome players to a brand new locale — The Dragon Isles. This long forgotten continent will comprise or four new areas — The Waking Shores, The Azure Span, The Ohn'ahran Plains, and the opulent kingdom of Thaldraszus — each packed out with quests to be undertaken, dungeons to be raided, and loot to be gathered, providing hours upon hours of new adventure for the community.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UANuDDQTNKY
Alongside the new locations, Dragonflight will also play host to a metamorphic new class, the Dracthyr Evoker. These characters can switch between their human and dragon forms, and will represent the first-ever "hybrid class" in WoW's long and storied history. In addition, as the expansion's title suggests, Dragonflight will feature a brand new, fully overhauled flight system, allowing players to take to the air with the greatest of ease in more deliberately controlled, skill-based aviation. What's that in the sky?
World of Warcraft: Dragonflight will launch globally on Monday, November 28, for specific times for your chosen territory, check out the details over on the official Dragonflight website. Good luck, scalies!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At this year's Gamescom I got hands-on with Bytten Studio's Cassette Beasts, an upcoming monster-taming open world RPG in the vein of Pokémon, which is far more interesting to me than the basic concept of Pokémon. That's because you're able to fuse together any monsters you 'catch', but moreso because it's a monster collectathon where you become the monster, essentially fusing yourself with bomb dogs and hermit crabs with traffic cone-homes.
I like the way the game does away with the overdone shonen story of wanting to become the very best there ever was, and instead puts the spotlight on its cast of characters and the relationships you form with your buds. It's looking mighty promising.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you've ever wondered what the 1987 film Running Man might look like as a turn-based tactics game (see also last year's Netflix sensation Squid Game, if the Running Man reference doesn't quite do it for you), then Homicidal All-Stars probably comes pretty close. It's the debut game from Artificer, a new studio formed by a bunch of ex-CreativeForge devs who worked on the first Hard West and Phantom Doctrine, and it centres on a woman called Scarlett who finds herself competing in the deadly TV show that gives the game its name. Like Running Man, Squid Game and all those other 'deadly games' you know and love, Homicidal All-Stars is about folks who down on their luck fighting for their lives, where their only consolation prize in these dystopian bloodbaths is not getting pulped at the end of it. 
For Scarlett, this means mowing down scumbags in classic turn-based fashion with a bunch of other friendly competitors she's teamed up with, but this is far from a straightforward XCOM-like. Between fights, you'll also be navigating its trap-filled arenas in third-person, dodging sniper turrets, disabling tripwires, and dashing over spiky/fiery/horrible pits to get to the end of each 'episode'. It's a refreshing mix based on an early preview build I've been playing recently, especially when its gameshow hook allows for its malicious host, Orion Ford, to start meddling with your success. "He’s the person behind the worst of the twists," creative director and Artificer CEO Kacper Szymczak tells me. "He’ll start filling the level with poisonous gas, he’ll turn off the lights, drop explosive barrels everywhere, to name just a few."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Ed Sheeran x Pokémon love affair continues
I love a good pop star/video game crossover, and thankfully they're pretty common these days. As part of the upcoming release of Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet, Pokémon teamed up with global pop sensation Ed Sheeran, whose new song will be featured in the game. It's called "Celestial," and the music video is out right now, featuring familiar faces like Squirtle, Pikachu, Machamp, and Snorlax, just to name a few. Fans are guessing that it might be used as an end credits song, or possibly as an upbeat opening to the game.
Believe it or not, this isn't the first time that Ed Sheeran has collaborated with the Pokémon brand. Last year, he put on a virtual concert in Pokémon GO that players could watch in-game. The concert included performances of six of his most beloved songs, and players could find special Pokémon as part of the event, including a Squirtle wearing sunglasses. Rapper Post Malone also put on a virtual concert for Pokémon fans last year to celebrate the series' 25th anniversary.
https://twitter.com/Pokemon/status/1575504573909069827
Personally I'd love to see more songs written specifically for games. Movies license well-known artists for their projects all the time — that's how we got bangers like "Sunflower" by Post Malone and Swae Lee for Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse or "All the Stars" by Kendrick Lamar and SZA for Black Panther.
That's not to say this hasn't been done already for games, though — the example that comes to mind is Florence + the Machine's cover of "Stand by Me," which served as the theme song for Final Fantasy XV. Then there's "Popstars" by K/DA, which was the theme for the 2018 League of Legends World Championship, which was a virtual girl group formed by members of the K-pop group (G)I-DLE as well as some western artists. Basically, I just want more songs like those, and this new Ed Sheeran number is a good start.

The DioField Chronicle is an odd one among the cavalcade of tactics we’ve seen this year. It’s real-time, rather than turn-based; it’s about tight, compact skirmishes rather than drawn-out battles. DioField mixes wyvern and rifles, swords and sorcery, and even some airships for good measure.
Throughout the 20-ish hours it took me to finish The DioField Chronicle, there are some pretty cool concepts and ideas on display, though they’re not always framed the best. There’s a solid story, but some odd choices in direction. DioField is an interesting strategy game to play, even when it’s not at its best.

        <updated>2022-09-29T20:30:28.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Finally, some good news
It feels like these days, we hear of a game's launch getting delayed at least once a week, but the developers behind the upcoming biopunk survival horror game Scorn have flipped the script. Instead of pushing back their release date, Ebb Software has announced that Scorn will be coming out on October 14 now, a week ahead of its previously planned October 21 date. They haven't given a reason why the game got moved up, but I certainly don't hear anyone complaining about it.
The game is inspired by the works of Swiss artist H.R. Giger, who is best known for his depictions of humans merged with machines. There's definitely plenty of creepy uncanniness going on there, which makes it the perfect title to come out right before Halloween. According to IGN, who got to play the first hour of the game, it has a big focus on puzzles, with the most apt comparison being The Witness when it comes to gameplay. I love that Scorn leans into more of a heady, intellectual spookiness that has the player exploring the labyrinthian corridors with little to no direction at all.
https://twitter.com/scorn_game/status/1575542179946237954
As the game's Steam page describes:
"Scorn takes place in an open-ended world with different interconnected regions. Each region is a maze-like structure with various rooms and paths to discover. All the storytelling happens in-game, with no cut-scenes to distract you from the grisly reality of the living, breathing world you’re in. But keep your eyes open — the game won’t show you any sympathy if you miss something important on your uneasy travels."
We haven't seen a game fill the grotesque horror niche in quite a while, so here's hoping that it lives up to the hype. I can't speak for anyone else, but Scorn usually isn't my kind of game, yet I feel really compelled to try it.

After five years in early access, Foxhole released version 1.0 today.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A local village for local people
Anybody fancying a little bit of a slow burn scare this weekend would do to take a look at Cloak & Dagger Games' latest release, The Excavation of Hob's Barrow, now available on PC via Steam and GOG.com.
Seeped in folk horror vibes and sporting an aesthetic reminiscent of the golden age of the Commodore Amiga, The Excavation of Hob's Barrow is the tale of author and antiquarian Thomasina Bateman, who is traveling the length and breadth of the countryside to explore the many barrows of Victorian England.
https://youtu.be/x-1C_9RQJb8
While her travels so far have brought about many interesting sights and characters, Bateman's arrival in the little-known village of Bewlay sees her research expedition take a particularly dark turn — with our intrepid hero becoming mired in a world of unanswered questions, ancient cultures, and living nightmares, as she delves deeper into the village and its highly unnerving community.
Choosing atmosphere, mood, and impending dread over the genre's well-worn trope of tired jump scares, The Excavation of Hob's Barrow blends mystery, exploration, and a sense of ancient malevolence to weave its tale, beckoning the player in with its intriguing locale, creepy cast of characters, and plucky, daring protagonist. It looks to be a real sleeper hit of the year, and well worth checking out for those who like their ghostly goings-on a little on the psychological side.
The Excavation of Hob's Barrow is available now on PC via Steam and GOG.com.

You might've already dipped in, but if not — or if you're fine doubling up — then it's good to know that a physical edition of Cuphead is on the way from iam8bit and Studio MDHR.
As shared on Twitter, the Cuphead physical edition is "coming soon" to Nintendo Switch, PS4, and Xbox One. The DLC, The Delicious Last Course, will be included on the disc, which isn't always the case but would've been egregious in this situation — it's so crucial.
As for regional releases, "Cuphead will come to retail with ESRB, PEGI, USK, and ACB versions," according to iam8bit.
https://twitter.com/iam8bit/status/1575470762235875329
The distributor is taking "keep me in the loop" email sign-ups today — but no word on release timing yet. With how widespread the Cuphead brand has become, I'm sure there will be plenty of opportunities to snag a physical copy at a reasonable price.
An eventual spiffy collector's edition would be great to see as well — there's so much art to consider — but an all-inclusive standard physical release is a good step.
It's truly one of my favorite games of the last decade, and for many of us, even folks who have moved mostly to digital, it's worth adding to the physical collection.

                      	September 23, 2022
			
            
The second I began Shovel Knight Dig, it felt like returning home. As someone who hadn’t played most of Shovel Knight’s post-launch DLC, the last time I touched this series was nearly a decade ago. Gaining control of the titular character immediately felt familiar, and my old Shovel Knight habits returned to greet this new take on the series, led by developer Nitrome this time. The moment-to-moment experience plays excellently, in part because it’s more Shovel Knight with some well-designed gameplay twists. However, the game’s venture into roguelite territory feels i…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ahead of the physical release of Bayonetta 1 on Switch
The two Bayonetta Switch games just got a version 1.1.0 patch (1, 2), mostly to shore things up language-wise (Korean, and traditional/simplified Chinese) ahead of the release of Bayonetta 3 in October — as well as the debut of the first Bayonetta on Switch in physical form.
Due out on September 30 (mine already shipped!), a $30 physical edition of the original game will be released, said to be "limited in number" by Nintendo directly. Interestingly enough, the Masquerade Edition of Bayonetta 3 will have three sleeves, which will allow you to store the first entry in it.
It's a flood of Bayonetta-related news! It's weird to think that this series debuted in 2009 (!), and it's still alive and kicking today. It just speaks to the overall quality of it, as some of Platinum's best work to date: and two of the best technical action games of all time. Hopefully Bayonetta 3 will complete the trifecta.
Bayonetta Switch Version 1.1.0 ［September 29, 2022］
General
Added support for Korean, Chinese (simplified), and Chinese (traditional) as in-game display and subtitle languages.
*Voice support languages ​​are Japanese and English only.
Bayonetta 2 Switch Version 1.1.0 ［September 29, 2022］
General
Added support for Korean, Chinese (simplified), and Chinese (traditional) as in-game display and subtitle languages.
*Voice support languages ​​are Japanese and English only.
*The latest update data is required to play online elements.
*Local communication is not compatible with Ver. 1.0.0. Please match the version of the update data with the person you play with.
[Thanks Jeff!]

The three big Nintendo Switch eShop releases this week offer something for everyone — but at least two of them will be met with some form of consternation.
Overwatch 2 is technically launching on Switch in the coming week (Thursday-to-Thursday), as it drops on October 4 on all platforms (with cross-progression). Then there's EA Sports FIFA 23 Nintendo Switch Legacy Edition, which doesn't cater to a whole lot of people; given that it's a Switch version of a yearly sports entry.
But then there's Railgrade, a $20 sci-fi train management sim, which is definitely going to cater to a lot of folks. The rest of the week is pretty packed, so enjoy navigating the 100s of digital games that launch every month on Switch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Google has revealed that its cloud-streaming games service, Stadia, will shut down early next year. 
More specifically, Stadia will close down its platform and end its online servers on January 18, 2023. After that, you won't be able to access the Stadia service in any way. As for your games and hardware, Google is offering refunds "for all Stadia hardware purchases (Stadia controllers, Founders Edition, Premiere Edition, and Play and Watch with Google TV packages) through the Stadia store," according to an FAQ posted by Google today. It seems like the only aspect of Stadia that won't be refunded are Stadia Pro subscriptions. However, you "will be able to continue playing your games in Pro without further charges until the final wind down date." 
If you are hoping to get a refund for your hardware, Google says "most hardware purchases...made directly from Google" will not require you to return your hardware. The company intends to have the majority of refunds processed by Stadia's January 18 shutdown date. 
The Stadia Store and all its functions have been turned off so you will not be able to make any more Stadia-related purchases or in-game transactions. 
Stadia shutting down isn't the most surprising news. Despite cloud gaming's continuing rise in popularity as of late thanks to the likes of Microsoft's Xbox Cloud Gaming initiative and others, Stadia never seemed to really take off. The first big sign that Stadia might not be long for this world came back in February of last year, when Google revealed it was ending its first-party game development and closing two studios. Then, this February, word got out that Google Stadia had reportedly been deprioritized by the company. Now, Stadia has just a few months left in it before it becomes a part of history. So long, Stadia.

Google is shutting down its cloud-based game streaming service Stadia. After a few years of operation, the service is shutting down and refunds are rolling out.
In a new blog post, Google VP and Stadia general manager Phil Harrison says the technology "hasn't gained the traction with users" it expected. So the company has decided to wind down its Stadia services.
Google will be refunding all Stadia hardware purchases made through the Google Store. All game and add-on content purchases made through the Stadia store will also be refunded.
Those who want to can keep playing their Stadia games through January 18, 2023. So if you've got a save file you want to clear, you'd better get on that. Google expects to have the "majority" of refunds completed…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good Fortune
Fun news for retro block-busting fans this week, as publisher Forever Entertainment has announced a return for the classic puzzle series, Magical Drop. Magical Drop VI, developed by studios Highball Games and Storm Trident, is scheduled to launch later this winter on Nintendo Switch.
Magical Drop, for those less inclined, is a cute 'n' colorful arcade puzzler that first launch in 1995, at the height of the "tile-puzzler" craze. Playing from one of a number of cute avatars, all based upon the Tarot, players must cherry-pick colored orbs from a rapidly descending playfield before firing them back in an effort to match the rainbow-infused patterns together. The goal of Magical Drop is to cause a chain reaction, and thus the player is encouraged to set up several moves ahead of time, that can all be triggered with one final, scalpel-precise move, (hence the series' Japanese title "Chain Reaction").

Developed by Data East and published by SNK, several Magical Drop games were released to arcade and home platform markets throughout the mid-'90s. The series' most recent release, Magical Drop V, launched on Steam in 2012 and was an enormous disappointment, riddled with bugs and issues that often rendered it incompletable. The game was eventually pulled from sale. This new release will no doubt be looking to capture the charm and character of classic entries while delivering engaging gameplay within a variety of single and multiplayer modes.
The visual style depicted here looks a bit "Flash game," but I remain hopeful, as Magical Drop happens to be my personal favorite of all the tile-puzzle franchises. My character of choice? Empress... But then... you knew that already, right? Shock-freakin'-horror.
Magical Drop VI is currently in development for Nintendo Switch.

        <updated>2022-09-29T16:00:05.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new thread to pull
Another PlayStation exclusive is making its way to the PC soon. Sackboy: A Big Adventure is getting a PC port on October 27.
Sumo Digital's thread-bound platformer released for PlayStation 4 and PS5 in 2020, as part of the PS5 launch lineup. Now, it's getting the PC treatment, with some new features in tow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAaEqyE_Hfg
The new port of Sackboy will allow for 4K resolution with a target of 120 FPS, if you've got the hardware for it. The platformer will also support a range of display ratios, including wider options like ultrawide, or 21:9.
Sackboy: A Big Adventure will also have NVIDIA DLSS2, or Deep Learning Super Sampling, for those with compatible graphics cards. Variable refresh rate support will also help with all that platforming.
While that's all for higher-end hardware, the PlayStation Blog also highlights lower-end options. It seems like owners with relatively older hardware might still be able to make this game run, albeit at lower settings.
The next big adventure
Sackboy is getting some customization options too. A Big Adventure will fully support the DualSense controller, so you can get those haptics and dynamic trigger effects, same as PlayStation 5.
Mouse and keyboard will also be supported, in both gameplay and the user interface. Achievements are included too, as are cloud saves on both Steam and Epic Games Store.
This seems like a good grab for folks who dig co-op in particular, but maybe don't have the newest hardware. As per our review, Sackboy: A Big Adventure seems like a pretty enjoyable co-op platformer to blast through with a friend or family member.
Sackboy also marks another PlayStation-exclusive game headed to PC. And considering how well these have been going, like with Marvel's Spider-Man and God of War, I'd hope to see more continue making their way over.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Publisher Kepler Interactive and developer Ebb Software have revealed that Scorn's release date has changed, moving up one week earlier in October. The game will now release on October 14 instead of the previously announced October 21. 
As for why, the team doesn't say. However, a new teaser trailer released today is titled, "You've waited long enough," so perhaps the studio simply wants to get this game into players' hands sooner. Check it out for yourself below: 


Here are some screenshots from the game: 

For more Scorn, check out this trailer from the June Xbox and Bethesda Showcase and then watch these 14 minutes of gameplay.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[An exciting new fan-made Quake singleplayer map pack explores the Internet's favourite architectural style, Brutalism. 35 maps offer all sorts of concrete hells, ranging from housing estates and Control-esque facilities to otherworldly ritual spaces and straight-up murderholes. Having spent much of my early thirties skulking around the Barbican, I really enjoyed this variety of Brutalist experiences. And the monstermurder. The monstermurder's fun, too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Skull and Bones has been delayed again, this time to March of next year. 
It was originally due out in 2018 but then delayed to 2019. It was delayed to at least March 2020 after that, but things went quiet and the game missed that window. Then, in May of last year, Ubisoft announced that Skull and Bones would release sometime between April 1, 2022, and March 31, 2023. And now, it's slipping out of its November 8 release date, which was only just announced back in July, into a new March 9, 2023 date. As for why, the team cites a need for more polish and balancing.
Kotaku's Ethan Gach says sources say the teams working on Skull and Bones are burnt out. According to Gach in his Kotaku story, the latest technical test for the game ended on September 19. One source involved with the test told Kotaku that gameplay was more refined than in previous tests but that progression needed work as it still felt too shallow. Gach writes that this is a concern shared by multiple sources close to the game's development. 
Here's what Ubisoft has to say about the delay: 
The last the public saw of Skull and Bones in a big way was during a July showcase, which is where we saw extensive gameplay and received the now-delayed November 8 release date. I learned a lot more about the game around the same time when Skull and Bones was Game Informer's cover story. At the time, the team seemed confident in its November release date but given the history of this title, I'm not surprised it's been delayed again. 
Are you excited to play Skull and Bones next March? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

More specifically, this EA Originals title will be released on February 17, 2023. This news comes by way of the game's reveal trailer released today. In it, we see a lot of monster hunting action. The game seems to take place in a mythological land filled with large and dangerous beasts. You'll need to craft better gear to take on tougher monsters, eventually taming the otherwise wild area. 
Check out the reveal trailer below: 


As you can see, Wild Hearts looks great, especially if you're someone who's a fan of Capcom's long-running Monster Hunter series.

I'm genuinely not thinking of any specific game, but many 'retro' inspired games fall into this way of thinking, and many more fans cut a good one down because of it.
Itorah, however, feels pure in the sense of capturing the essence, the heart of a good retro platformer, not just going through the motions to technically qualify for an arbitrary category. Aeons ago, it would have ported comfortably to your GameBoys and gramophones, and probably look just as pretty and feel just as good in motion, judging by the talented art direction on show here.

Between the moment Guybrush uttered this iconic line in Return to Monkey Island and our reintroduction to familiar characters like used ship salesman Stan S. Stanman and Cobb, with his "Ask me about Loom" badge, I was already shrouded in a haze of nostalgia. And you would be eating all these up, too, if you're a Monkey Island fan. The thing about Monkey Island enthusiasts is that we can talk your ears off about what makes the series so unique.

This news comes from a new Overwatch 2 blog post, as reported by Destructoid.

The new FTUE addresses that feedback directly. In phase one, players will need to unlock the game's modes and chat functions – this happens "rapidly," Blizzard writes in the blog post. Then, in phase two, players will unlock the original Overwatch heroes by playing "approximately 100 matches," a…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s usually nice to see older games get updates, particularly when we’re not expecting it. Think of it as a good jump scare. Supermassive Games have given their first two The Dark Pictures Anthology some extra care and attention today, dropping in new difficulty settings and accessibility options, tweaked UI, and even faster walking for characters. There’s also an extended chapter for Man Of Medan. I didn’t think update trailers were a thing but there’s one for this, which you can watch below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are Pokémon designs like Charizard that make me go, "ooo yes, very nice" and there are others like Voltorb that make me go, "oh, why do you exist?" There's also a rare third class of Pokémon I call "weird lil things" when I see them and Wiglett, a new Pokémon joining the Pokédex in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, is that class' newest member. 
Today, Nintendo and The Pokémon Company released a 3 and a half minute video highlighting Wiglett, its similarities to Diglett, and how it's just different enough that it is an entirely new species, rather than a regional variant. As such, this new Diglett-like Pokémon is called Wiglett. It looks like a worm, lives in the sea and on the beach, and seems to stick together with other Wigletts. Check it out in Serebii's video below: 


I'm most excited to see Wiglett's evolution, if it evolves at all. But hopefully, I'll see that in another trainer's party because I'm not sure Wiglett is a sure bet for mine. 
For more about Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, watch the latest trailer that shows off new school rivalries, gym leaders, and more, and then watch this trailer all about competitive play in the 9th generation of Pokémon. After that, read our preview of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet to find out everything you need to know about the Paldea region. 
Is Wiglett going to be in your party? Let us know what you think of it in the comments below!]]></summary>

I'd even go so far as to say it might be the perfect side entrance into the Yakuza series as a whole.

        <link href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-excavation-of-hobs-barrow-review"/>
        <updated>2022-09-28T04:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's tough making a story where you establish early on that your main character will still be alive at the end. In The Excavation Of Hob's Barrow, a point and click, small town, folk horror adventure game, the events are narrated by the main character Thomasina, writing in the future, and the game walks a slightly different line. Rather than successfully making you believe a character you know survives is in peril, all the way through The Excavation Of Hob's Barrow you are aware that Thomasina in the future is alive but, somehow, definitely not okay. And you believe you can save her anyway.
This looming dread, growing increasingly loom as the game goes on, is one of the most effective weapons in Hob's Barrows' arsenal of horror. Thomasina, a barrow-digger and proto-feminist trouser-wearer in a time when trousers were worn by men, is a practical and mostly cheerful woman. She approaches all the puzzles she has to solve in the robust, roll-your-sleeves up manner of an old-timey governess who doesn't care if you hate learning French verbs. The Thomasina of the future voiceover, however, sounds blank, drained and sad. It's a contrast that weighs more and more heavy as you slice into the horrible heart of Hob's Barrow, and it underscores how great it is to play the game in its fully voiced form.
As well as the voice acting, Hob's Barrow has an appropriately creepsome soundtrack, making fabulous use of the juddering bass tones that put all humans and related monkeys automatically on edge, and isn't a stranger to unsettling lighting. Evil in this game is a sick purple. Most of all, some praise should be especially given to the several horrible close-ups that pop up: Thomasina's eyes, wide in shock, a malevolent cat as he crawls onto your bed; round eyes over a slack, downturned mouth with little peg teeth in it. Devs Cloak And Dagger Games can coax extraordinary depth and motion from their pixel-art and then use that to repulse you.

Blizzard today outlined how they intend to prevent "disruptive behaviour" from players, including the use of SMS verification and machine learning. More awkwardly, game modes will be locked for first-time players, and Overwatch 1's original heroes will only be unlocked "over the course of approximately 100 matches."

But alas, both time and its ferociously difficult combat have got the better of me, so you'll have to settle for some impressions instead. This isn’t simply a case of drinking the 'git gud' kool-aid either. While I'll hold my hands up now and say that Soulslikes have always been a bit of a challenge for me, I feel like I've been making some pretty good in-roads into the genre lately, and after falling in love with Moonscars' reveal trailer earlier in the year during the Humble Games Showcase, I really, really, really wanted to like this one. Sadly, it's become increasingly clear that Moonscars does not like me very much, and maybe even hates my guts a bit - which is ironic, considering how many organs I've chucked at its feet over the last week and a bit to appease its hungry dread moon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There’s nothing inherently wrong with the AMD Radeon RX 6650 XT's concept – faster clock speeds than the RX 6600 XT, to better compete with Nvidia’s RTX cards? Yeah why not – but surely its timing is questionable. Any GPU launching several months into 2022 would only ever do so under the looming shadows of Nvidia’s GeForce RTX 40 series and the AMD Radeon RX 7000 series, the latter being officially revealed in just a few days’ time. Not to mention Intel Arc Alchemist, delayed as it has been.


Still. AMD’s next-gen, RDNA 3-based GPUs are an unknown quantity, and the RTX 40 series will at first focus on high-end models like the RTX 4090. Even if its RDNA 2 architecture is on the way out, could the RX 6650 XT not find room in the pack as one of the best graphics cards for 1080p and 1440p?

Now imagine that surface is constantly under threat from waves of alien attacks and that's pretty much Dome Keeper in a nutshell, a moreish, meditative mining game that sees you balance digging for resources and hunting for all-important relics while defending your eponymous dome from being smashed to smithereens.

There’s also a new building that lets you craft runes, along with the usual bug fixes and performance tweaks. The village of Ravensthorpe’s Oskoreia festival returns for one last bash next month too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Grounded released into early access a little over two years ago, it immediately became a personal favourite. The story wasn't complete and the garden was rather basic, but one encounter with the wolf spider proved that this was far more than a pile of mulch. With two years of updates layering new enemies, items, biomes, dungeons, and quests onto that healthy foundation, Grounded has blossomed into a perennial survival game that sits comfortably among the very best of the genre.

Tinykin smartly blends platforming and puzzle-solving with the minion management of Nintendo's Pikmin series. Players control a flea-sized astronaut who travels from his home planet to Earth to trace humanity’s true origins. The explorer’s journey takes him to an ordinary home occupied by sentient insects who worship a mysterious deity. To return home, the astronaut must assemble a rocket by gathering ordinary household objects with the help of small, adorable aliens called Tinykin.

However, the most significant change arriving alongside the sequel's new free-to-play format is a Battle Pass.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A while back, I was wondering where all the Steam Deck accessories were. Valve themselves have the case covered, including a decent hard case with even the cheapest 64GB models, and it’s not difficult to pick up one of the best microSD cards for the Steam Deck. Otherwise, and especially with delays to Valve’s official dock, there’s not much out there from the usual PC hardware suppliers.
I therefore turned to the makers and sellers of Etsy, where a kind of indie Steam Deck accessory market has emerged. Soon, I’d bought (with my own money, you’re welcome ReedPop) a selection of unique, handcrafted, sometimes questionable gadgets and appendages, and promptly packed them onto a train for independent appraisal by a newly minted Steam Deck owner. Specifically, RPS vid bud Liam.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At long last, HBO has released the first trailer for The Last of Us. Though officially classified as a “teaser,” it offers nearly two minutes of clips that provide pretty good looks at the upcoming adaptation. 
The teaser doesn’t reveal a premiere date, but we get to see how Joel (Pedro Pascal) and Ellie (Bella Ramsey) survive the post-apocalyptic world, scenes of humanity's collapse a la the game's prologue, and a quick glimpse of a Clicker. 


The Last of Us is led by Craig Mazin of Chernobyl fame and Naughty Dog co-president Neil Druckmann. We learned during Summer Game Fest that Troy Baker and Ashley Johnson, who portray Joel and Ellie in the games, will have unspecified roles in the series. The Last of Us will be available to stream exclusively on HBO Max in 2023.
To help prepare fans for what's to come, Naughty Dog recently released a remake of the first game dubbed The Last of Us Part 1. You can read editor Blake Hester's impressions of that title here.]]></summary>

Players old and new have flocked to the dystopian RPG since Edgerunners debuted on Netflix earlier this month, and I imagine more than a few might want to cosplay as their Best Girl (a controversial topic which I dare not broach).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In March, the Entertainment Software Association (ESA) announced that E3 would return next year as an in-person show following the cancellation of the 2022 edition. We now know the dates of the event as well as how it will be structured.
E3 2023 takes place at the Los Angeles Convention Center from Tuesday, June 13 through Friday, June 16. Digital presentations, such as the annual press conferences held by first and third-party publishers, take place a couple of days before, beginning June 11. 
The ESA also states that the show will feature separate admission days for industry professionals and the general public. E3 Business Days, designated for developers, publishers, and press/media, take place on June 13-15. Media registration opens in December. 
June 15-16 will host E3 Gamer Days, where fans will be admitted to the show floor. There is no date for public registration at this time. Since E3 first opened its doors to fans in 2017, professionals and the public have largely intermingled for the entirety of the show, which has caused issues in terms of crowd traffic. E3 adopting the same dividing format as events such as Tokyo Game Show should alleviate that problem.   
As previously announced, PAX/New York Comic-Con organizer ReedPop will helm E3 2023. The company has promised to make E3 into a "world class event to serve the global gaming industry." The last E3 to take place in-person at the LA Convention Center was in 2019. The 2020 show was canceled due to the pandemic, and the 2021 version was a digital-only show.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Silent Hill: The Short Message has been rated by South Korea's Game Rating committee, and it's possible this is a new unannounced Silent Hill game. 
This news comes by way of Video Games Chronicle, which reported that the rating committee rated Silent Hill: The Short Message today. However, the rating did not include any platforms, so it's unclear where this game might land if it actually ends up being a real title. In fact, the rating features little else other than listing Uniana as its publisher. As VGC notes, this company regularly publishes Konami games in South Korea. 
The publication also notes that Silent Hill: The Short Message might be related to one of various Silent Hill projects reportedly in the works at multiple different studios. VGC reported in February that Konami is planning a revival of the Silent Hill series amidst other reports stating that a Silent Hill 2 remake is in development. 
While waiting to hopefully learn more about Silent Hill: The Short Message, read about Silent Hill creator Keiichiro Toyama's new game, Slitterhead.

Not since Untitled Goose Game have I heard this much excited chat about a game from pals who don't usually talk about games. This is because: 1) it's a fun silly idea; 2) it's very funny to miss a trombone note and squeal out a farty toot in the middle of Also Sprach Zarathustra. As I play Trombone Champ myself, I come to really appreciate that. It's a rare rhythm game where playing badly doesn't frustrate or berate me, because the worst-case scenario is making fart noises, and fart noises are funny.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Standing here, I realize that this Super Replay will be a cut above the rest because we’ll be slicing and dicing in Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance! Join us today on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central to enjoy two hours of what will be a full playthrough of the cult favorite action game streaming weekly each Friday. 
Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance serves as a sequel/spin-off to Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots that puts cyborg ninja Raiden at the helm. Instead of sneaking around in boxes, players eviscerate foes in fast-paced, stylish action courtesy of developer Platinum Games. Since its launch in 2013, Revengence’s action and absurdity have garnered it a passionate internet fandom, but I have a little secret: I didn’t think the game was all that special when I played it at launch. However, years of being inundated with internet memes and being told my opinion is incorrect has inspired me to give Revengece another look. Will I acquire a new appreciation for the game nine years later? How many watermelons will I slice? You’ll have to tune in to find out. 
Watch on Twitch!
Join me, Marcus Stewart, along with Blake Hester as we revisit Raiden’s beloved solo adventure. If you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes. You’ll also be granted entry to the official Game Informer Discord channel, where our welcoming community members, moderators, and staff gather to talk games, entertainment, food, and organize hangouts!]]></summary>

The animated film, starring Chris Pratt as the titular plumber, will hit theaters on April 7, 2023. The biggest question regarding the film has been what Pratt’s Mario performance will sound like, and we may finally get to hear it in just a few weeks. The movie’s first teaser trailer premieres on October 6 at 4 p.m. ET during the New York Comic Con.

The Super Mario Bros. cast includes Charlie Day as Luigi, Anya Taylor-Joy as Peach, Jack Black as Bowser, Keegan-Michael Key as Toad, and Seth Rogan as Donkey Kong. The film was delayed to ensure quality, though Nintendo was reportedly pleased last year with how the film was shaping up at that point. Pratt recently described his performance as “unlike anything you’ve heard in the Mario world,” and it apparently won't have an Italian accent.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The RPS-beloved turn-based strategy game Solium Infernum is back from the dead. Announced earlier today on stage at EGX London 2022, Armello creators League Of Geeks will be resurrecting and reimagining the game in 2023. Originally released in 2009 by solo dev Vic Davis and his studio Cryptic Comet, Solium Infernum cast you as an Archfiend hoping to stake a claim for Satan's empty throne. With a strong emphasis on political intrigue and Machiavellian backstabbing over taking things by force, this strategy game from hell was a firm RPS favourite back in the day, spawning an eight-part diary series of the team's play-by-email multiplayer adventures. Alas, it never quite found the audience it deserved back in the early 2010s, eventually causing Davis to shut up shop completely in 2015 and pursue a career in tabletop.
League Of Geeks are here to change that, though, and after speaking with studio director and co-founder Trent Kusters (both at EGX earlier today and during a hands-off presentation of their pre-alpha demo late last week), it's clear the team have taken great care in bringing Solium Infernum up to date for modern audiences. It leans into all the same kinds of mind games as Cryptic Comet's original, and its simultaneous turn structure is still very much intact – just with lusher 3D visuals, and all-new, revamped menu screens. And it looks devilishly good.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Playing Wayward Strand feels like navigating a detailed clockwork mechanism. It reminds me of those cuckoo clocks where on the hour every hour a tiny door opens revealing two mechanical dolls that come together and have a 'lil smooch. That’s essentially how Wayward Strand works but on a bigger scale. Characters are set on strict routines, following predetermined paths and schedules that are often invisible to you. They welcome an interruption - a friendly natter or helpful hand - but whether you’re there or not, they’ll go about their business regardless. The world keeps on spinning and all that.
It’s an interesting way of capturing the passage of time, and in Wayward Strand how you choose to spend that time is pretty important in a game that makes a point of not waiting for you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While Hyper Demon is a game of immense and almost incomprehensible violence, the surprise sequel to Devil Daggers opens in such a lovely way. Before beginning your descent into deicide, you must claim your unholy knife and oh, there it is, surrounded by hopping little crystalline birds! What pretty birds they are! Oh, and they're cheeping little tinging cheeps! And they hop back if I step towards them! And they flutter into the skies if I charge! And form a big flock if I chase long enough! Ah. Yeah, I think I see how our character earned a place in superhell.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Indie rhythm game Trombone Champ released on Steam last week, and it deserves a round of applause for its sheer commitment to the brass majesty of the ‘bone. Maybe it’s the selection of classic bangers such as Old Grey Mare and Take Me Out To The Ballgame, or perhaps it's the constant prompts of NASTY and PERFECTO, but devs Holy Wow seem to be on to a winner. If you haven’t already witnessed the game in action then please do yourself a favour and watch the trailer below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Have you ever played a game and thought, "Are we actually the bad guys here?" Usually, the whole "we're fighting on the wrong side of history" line is a deliberate plot device in RPGs, offering moments of clarity to not only peel back the curtain and provide fresh impetus for the events yet to come, but also to cleverly reframe everything you've achieved so far. I don't say this to spoil the events of The DioField Chronicle, the new real-time strategy game from Lancarse and Square Enix, but it is a question I found myself asking a lot during its middle act - and it never quite delivers the punchline you're looking for. 
Around 8-10 hours into the game, there's an extended portion of the campaign that sees your band of Blue Fox mercenaries bringing an entire region of DioField Island to heel because they're, err, pro democracy. Of the cast's central quartet, only one stands up as a voice of reason when motions are made to quell these despicable riots, but he's repeatedly shot down every time he tries to offer an alternate view. Eventually, one character says to him, and I quote, "Isca, what has got into you? You ought to know the danger posed by the ideology of democracy." It's an odd stance for someone clearly not a villain to take in 2022, although really, I should have probably seen it coming. Our mercs work for a duke after all, and most are aristocratic nobles who are handy with a sword. Oh no. I think this might actually be played: Tories - The Game. Yuck.

        <updated>2022-09-21T17:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Apple TV show Ted Lasso has proven to be one of the most popular and well-liked series of the last few years, introducing viewers to a lovable cast of characters whose lives and storylines largely revolve around the fictional English Premier League football club, AFC Richmond. Through its first two seasons, the series has taken home numerous awards, including the Primetime Emmy for Outstanding Comedy Series in 2021 and 2022, with several of its actors – including Jason Sudeikis, Brett Goldstein, and Hannah Waddingham – taking home awards for original performances. Now, Ted Lasso reaches into a new realm: video games. 
EA Sports today announced that Ted Lasso and AFC Richmond are joining the FIFA 23 roster of teams. Lasso is joined on the sidelines by Coach Beard, with the pitch being populated by some of the team's biggest stars like Jamie Tartt, Roy Kent, Dani Rojas, Sam Obisanya, and Isaac McAdoo. While the actors' likenesses are included in the product, EA Sports hasn't indicated if we'll be hearing Jamie Tartt and Roy Kent's signature crowd chants (though it seems doubtful, seeing as how Roy Kent's chant would probably bump the ESRB rating up to M for Mature).
Regardless of that fact, you can play matches at AFC Richmond's home ground, Nelson Road, and even take control of Coach Lasso or AFC Richmond through Career Mode. AFC Richmond is also playable in Kick-Off, Online Friendlies, and Online Seasons. FIFA 23 Ultimate Team is also adding several AFC Richmond customization items, including kits, TIFOs, and the option to select Ted Lasso or Coach Beard as your FUT club's manager. All the AFC Richmond content in FUT will be obtainable through objectives and challenges.
You can see Ted Lasso and the AFC Richmond squad in action through the trailer below.


FIFA 23 arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4. Xbox One, PC, and Stadia on September 30.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a sucker for invention when it comes to story in video games, and Beacon Pines drew me in with what looked like a choice-driven adventure. As you explore the down-on-its-luck farming town of the title, you discover 'charms'. Each charm is a word which can be deployed at set points to branch the story in new, severe ways. More importantly, you can flip back and forth between these pivotal moments at any time, allowing you to deploy new words in earlier chapters to see what happens.

Except, Beacon Pines is far less choice-driven than I expected. Instead, it's something far rarer and more ambitious in video games: it is a good story, well written, with strong characters you grow to care for.

When Gun Interactive revealed The Texas Chain Saw Massacre last year, I was underwhelmed by its short teaser but excited about its potential. It’s one of my favorite horror movie franchises, partly because of how much it still scares me – every good haunted house has a Leatherface at the end that chases you out to the exit, right? – but also because of its backdrop: Texas. Horror, be it movies or games, typically draws attention to dreary atmospheres, spooky ambiance, perhaps some bad weather, and nighttime. The Texas Chain Saw Massacre bucked that trend in the 1970s.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The best way I can explain the difference between Devil Daggers and its surprise sequel is comparison to another pair of goth-o-ramas: Devil Daggers is Dark Souls to Hyper Demon's Bloodborne. Both first-person score attack shooters are dressed in similar beautiful cloaks of skulls and gurgling industrial soundscapes, but while Devil Daggers nudges you into cautious survival, Hyper Demon shoves you into aggression. In Hyper Demon, a long and cautious run will likely score lower than a short burst of ultraviolence. What glorious ultraviolence it is!
When I first saw Hyper Demon's trailer, I felt excitement, wonder, and fear. Here's the important thing to realise: the unearthly and incomprehensible violence you see in that trailer is genuinely what the game looks like to play. That's how it feels to play, too.

Nope - the game wasn't what I expected at all. At least, not the 45-minute portion I got to play. Rather, my demo was more of a hardcore puzzler with some exploration elements and the teeniest smattering of action. Don't get me wrong, it was still unsettling and grotesque!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hot on the heels of this week's announcement of Ken, Dhalsim, Blanka, and E.Honda in Street Fighter 6, Capcom has posted the opening video of World Tour mode from the highly anticipated sixth mainline entry in its legendary fighting franchise. Through the video, the publisher reveals the full fighter roster at launch, featuring a good mix of fresh faces and familiar foes.
The launch lineup of fighters includes 18 characters to choose from. You can see the full list below.
Blanka
Cammy
Chun-Li
Dee Jay
Dhalsim
E. Honda
Guile
Jamie
JP
Juri
Ken
Kimberly
Lily
Luke
Manon
Marisa
Ryu
Zangief


Many of these fighters made their first appearances in Street Fighter (Ken and Ryu) or Street Fighter II (Blanka, Cammy, Chun-Li, Dee Jay, Dhalsim, E. Honda, Guile, Zangief). However, some fresher faces include Juri (debuted in Street Fighter IV) and Luke (debuted in Street Fighter V), and six all-new characters: Jamie, JP, Kimberly, Lily, Manon, and Marisa.
Check out the opening movie above and start plotting who will be your main when Street Fighter 6 launches on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PC next year.

NBA 2K23, the latest in Visual Concepts’ long-running, annualized basketball series, introduces multiple new features and revamped game mechanics while taking us on a stroll down memory lane.

Although Capcom just pulled the curtain back on the next batch of fighters to join the roster, my demo included the first playable sessions for the last trio of reveals: Guile, Juri, and newcomer Kimberly. Since Kimberly was the wildcard of that bunch, I opted to spend most of my hands-on time discovering what she brings to the table. After only a few rounds, I had a tough time wanting to switch to anyone else.
If you haven’t been keeping up, Kimberly is a ninja pupil of Guy who adores the ‘80s and graffiti. She incorporates the latter interest into her acrobatic offense, such as throwing exploding spray cans like they’re shurikens. That’s silly and fantastic.

The Pokémon franchise has been more prolific than usual as of late, with multiple releases over the past year and another big entry coming soon. However, those without a Switch or looking for a suitable monster-battling alternative should focus on Temtem, which has emerged from years of early-access development. While borrowing heavily from the formula of Nintendo’s massive franchise, its world is fun to explore, and collecting and learning all about the titular Temtems is satisfying.

Given the latter game’s events and the tantalizing trailer for its second part, Rebirth, it had me thinking that it may be a good time to dust off my copy of 2008’s Crisis Core. Square Enix read my mind by announcing a remaster of Zack Fair’s PSP adventure, christening it with the subtitle “Reunion,” giving newcomers the answer to the question of “who the heck was that black-haired fella in Remake?” As for me, I thought I had a good reason to return to the game. After playing a decent chunk of Reunion at Tokyo Game Show, I’m all good. 
My expectations were always reasonable. Reunion is a remaster, not a remake the scale of, well, Remake. That means that feature-wise, the best way to sum it up is “That PSP game? You can pl…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let me fill you in on a little secret most people won't tell you: the real way to enjoy a video game show is at home, comfortably on your couch, watching the event on YouTube. 
Over the years, the game press has done a remarkable job tricking you into thinking otherwise. The shows look extravagant, energetic, and almost like we're getting glimpses into the future, which we then curate into bite-sized news stories and on-demand trailers for our faithful readers back home. 
The reality is much more depressing.
Whether it's E3, PAX, Gamescom, or in this case, Tokyo Game Show, going to a video game trade event means dealing with the near-lethal combination of jetlag and overwork. The brutal FOMO of being in some of the coolest cities in the world but spending all your time in convention halls. The unbelievable cacophony of thousands of people talking at once. The unbelievable smells of thousands of people all standing too close to each other. The never-ending lines of thousands of people all needing to use the toilet at the same time. This doesn't even touch on the unavoidable safety concerns of having a video game conference in the midst of an ongoing pandemic. But I digress.
All that said, there's some fun stuff to look at, like big, gaudy statues and giant booths that likely cost tens of thousands of dollars for games you've never heard of and likely will never play. Stuff that really makes it all worth it. 
While we'd love to fly each and every one of you out to Tokyo, sadly, we only had the budget to fly out two of our full-time employees. So in lieu of attending yourself, please enjoy my curated batch of pictures of what I saw on the show floor. 
Well, there you have it, folks. All the fun of TGS without actually being there. See you next year!]]></summary>

More specifically, these two remasters will be packaged into the same collection and this remastered duo is due out on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC (via Steam) in 2023. The first Suikoden was released in 1995, and its sequel, Suikoden II, was released in 1998. Check out what the remastered versions of these classic games look like in the announcement trailer below: 


As you can see, these remasters are looking excellent, especially in the way that the original look and feel of the sprite imagery remains intact. Here's hoping they feel as great to play as they did back in the day. 
Here are some highlights of this remastered collection from the game's Steam page:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Capcom has revealed four more fighters joining the Street Fighter 6 roster alongside new details about the upcoming fighting game’s World Tour, Battle Hub, and more. 
All of this Street Fighter 6 news came during Tokyo Games Show, which officially began today, and if you’re a fan of Capcom’s long-running fighting game series, strap in because there’s a lot.


Let’s start with the fighters.

        <updated>2022-09-15T13:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Saturnalia is an upcoming survival horror game with an extremely unique art style announced last month. Now, we know when we can play it because Saturnalia has captured an October 27 release date. 
That's when it will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC (via the Epic Games Store). Developed by Italy-based studio Santa Ragione, the team behind games like Fotonica, MirrorMoon EP, and Wheels of Aurelia, Saturnalia is shaping up to be a great time. You can find out why in the New Gameplay Today segment we recorded that's all about Saturnalia, featuring more than 15 minutes of gameplay, below: 


"[Saturnalia] is a kaleidoscopic adventure inspired in equal parts by authentic Sardinian folklore and classic Italian Giallo horror films," a press release reads. "The story involves a mysterious, centuries-old ritual that occurs every year on the night of the winter solstice in the Italian village of Gravoi. Each of the game's four playable characters must utilize their unique abilities and confront their own personal revelations in order to expose the secrets haunting the town and ultimately escape their doom."
Here are some additional Saturnalia highlights from Santa Ragione: 
Seek clues in a maze-like village with no markers or compass to guide your steps.
Explore the ever-changing town of Gravoi using matches to keep the dark at bay.
Flight and stealth are your only options, as you cannot fight the creature that hunts you.
Immerse yourself in the stop-motion animation and vibrant expressionist art style of Saturnalia for an eerily beautiful atmosphere that is as enthralling as it is chilling.
Control your fate through non-linear progression and a dynamic, adaptive narrative, with unique endgames dependent on player choices.


Saturnalia hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC via the Epic Games Store on October 27.

Of course, you will instantly unlock the character alongside newcomers Sojourn and Junker Queen by purchasing the premium battle pass.
