Now that pandemic restrictions have been eased, Nintendo is back at it celebrating its new Switch releases with midnight launches. If you happen to be located in New York or nearby, you might be interested to know it will be hosting a special launch event for the upcoming releases Pokémon Scarlet and Violet.
The games will launch on the 18th Friday. The catch is reservations are required. You can reserve a spot over on Nintendo's Tickets and Warp Pipe Passes page when they go live. Nintendo also shared some extra information about this event on social media:

One game that we would highly recommend checking out on the Nintendo Switch is Mario Strikers: Battle League. Next Level Games released the game on the hybrid system back in June, and since then it's been receiving regular patches and content updates.
Now, Nintendo has released a brand new demo for the game via the Switch eShop - allowing newcomers to check out a "limited selection" of characters and stadiums in the game.

As a fan of both literature and puzzle games, Storyteller has been one of my most anticipated games of the year. The game takes place in the pages of a storybook, and requires players to combine different elements like characters, settings, and objects to create coherent stories. There are multiple ways to solve each puzzle, making for some fun, creative, and challenging gameplay. Storyteller was first announced during last year's Annapurna Interactive Showcase, which showed off the basic mechanics of the game in a short trailer. After almost a year and a half of waiting, Annapurna finally announced Storyteller's official release date for Steam and Nintendo Switch: March 23, 2023.

After decades of gamers thirsting over the sexy, sexy female video game characters out there, it looks like our favorite virtual himbos are finally getting the mainstream attention they deserve.

These are great monitors, don't get me wrong, but you could spend a fraction of the money and still get a brilliant monitor.
That brings us neatly to the subject of this deals post: the Dell S3422DWG, a 34-in ultrawide gaming monitor that sits at the comfortable crossroads of refresh rate and resolution: 3440x1440 and 144Hz. Rather than expensive OLED, this monitor comes with a curved VA panel, offering excellent contrast, great colours and good motion handling, while costing significantly less: just £351 when you use code GSGALLMON10 at the checkout, down from £390.

Both are now discounted from Crampton & Moore via Ebay, with a 25% off coupon ("FLASH25") that maxes out at a pretty sweet £150 discount. 
That means you can pick up the 42-in for £779 and the 48-in model for £848, both of which are the best prices we've ever seen for these highly recommended TVs.

It's not often we get to do in-person interviews these days. It's even less frequent that we get to travel to a game studio to do them. But this might be a first, because for this interview, we actually got to go to a developer's house.
It turns out that Max Inferno, the two-person studio making upcoming Switch game A Little to the Left, is based in Halifax, Nova Scotia — just around the corner from our Staff Writer, Kate. We couldn't pass up the opportunity to bag a world-exclusive chat with Lukas and Annie, the two developers of this charming tidying-up puzzle game, and we're glad we did, because we think the game is exactly what many of us need right now: Something quiet, contemplative, and a little bit magical. Also, it's out right now, as announced in the November 9th Indie World Showcase! What a neat bit of synergy.

An open world Sonic game that draws upon well-liked inspirations like Zelda: Breath of the Wild seemed like something that wouldn't be disastrous at the very least. Thankfully, it isn't. But some of it is definitely an acquired taste.

As you saw with our cover reveal yesterday, one of the most iconic characters is a centerpiece of Street Fighter 6's story. Ken Masters, one of the two original playable Street Fighter characters, steps back into the spotlight with an all-new backstory. As soon as his new look was unveiled, the Street Fighter community had a field day pondering what happened to put Ken in the rough state he appeared, with memes popping up deeming him "Hobo Ken." While at Capcom's headquarters in Osaka, Japan, we spoke with Street Fighter 6 director Takayuki Nakayama and art director Kaname Fujioka to get more details abou…]]></summary>

Pokemon is such a massive IP that leaks are inevitable. No matter how much Nintendo tries to clamp down, some content creator is likely going to show off part of the game, and/or someone is probably going to buy it early from any number of retailers that break street date. Well the latter is exactly what happened, so be aware that Pokemon Scarlet and Violet leaks are out in the wild.
As was the case with Legends, Twitter is the main source of leak sharing. Many users are getting takedown notices from Nintendo and The Pokemon Company, leading to even more proliferation and more sharing. A heap of these do not have spoiler warning shields, and are just flying around. So you may want to mute anything Pokemon related if you use the platform regularly, or just stay off of it entirely for a bit if you're really bothered by leaks.
Most Pokemon subreddits have extensive leak policies in place that prevent accidental reveals: including the "main" one, so you might be safe there.
Pokemon Scarlet/Violet: Leaks
The Pokemon Leaks reddit has compiled a full list so far, which is fully in text form. This is by far the safest place to look, as Twitter is sometimes inaccurate (people throwing in fake leaks), constantly riddled with takedowns, and hard to search.

Today sees the long-anticipated arrival of one of the biggest sequel's in gaming history, as Sony Santa Monica's magnum opus, God of War Ragnarok, launches on PlayStation platforms — And while Fathers and Boys everywhere will be eager to stand up against the coming wave of armageddon, the developer has suggested that you take a moment or two to download the sequel's day one patch.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1wr0DfV73E
The God of War Ragnarok V2 patch features over 100 tweaks and fixes, relating to the epic title's UI, combat, controls, visual elements, dialogue, accessibility options, menus, and much, much more. There are also specific stability fixes for both PS4 and PS5. You can check out the huge list of fixes via the official patch notes, though be warned that SSM suggests that the tweaks feature minor spoilers pertaining to abilities, creatures, and questlines. The update should download as soon as you install the game.
God of War Ragnarok is the follow-up to the stellar 2018 release, God of War. The new title follows the continued adventures of an aging Kratos and his brave but somewhat inexperienced son, Atreus, as they face the coming of Ragnarok — the fabled event said to bring death and destruction to a number of gods and figures of power, while bringing chaos to the world and its climate. Quite what role our heroes will play in this event, and how it ties into the lives of their allies and enemies... Well, we'll have to just play the game to find out.
God of War Ragnarok is available now on PlayStation platforms. Check out Chris Carter's review right here.

The Indie World Showcase threw a lot of stellar looking titles our way, and one that really stood out to us was GOODBYE WORLD, which launches on Switch later this month.
ISOLATION STUDIO and PM Studios, Inc. have managed to put together a game which looks to tick a lot of boxes for us. It's got friendship, it's got classic pixel art aesthetics, it's got nods to the grind of game development. Combine all that with the fact that the in-game development is taking place for a suspiciously Game Boy-looking device which you can play (at this point, we'll take a GB emulator on Switch any way we can), and you can consider us sufficiently intrigued.

For God of War Ragnarök, Williams put a pause on his video game consulting business to take on the director role for the highly anticipated sequel. We spoke with Williams about why God of War 2018's director, Cory Barlog, had to convince him to take on the role, why nearly every God of War game has a new director, how he discovered he is not able to generate visuals in his mind's eye, how the surprising casting of Richard Schiff as Odin came about, and plenty more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Make it a priority, Sony
When Ghost of Tsushima came out a few years back, I knew it was something special. That's why I was waiting for the Director's Cut/DLC package with open arms. Now I'm waiting for basically anything else. A PC port would do.
Sadly there is no confirmation at all right now that Ghost of Tsushima is even getting a PC port, but we can look at some trends and surmise that it's likely going to happen. It was also part of that partially correct, partially incorrect Nvidia PC leak from 2021.
Here are the games Sony currently has on PC/Steam:
God of War (2018)
Spider-Man Remastered
Spider-Man: Miles Morales (out on November 18)
Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection (Uncharted 4 and Lost Legacy)
Sackboy: A Big Adventure
Note that the earliest game is God of War, and it was released in January of this year. Yep, all of the above list launched in 2022. Sony is clearly serious about porting their biggest games to PC, and if Sackboy can make the cut, a lot of other titles could too.
But Ghost of Tsushima, like many other open world games, would be incredible to mess around with on PC. I mean, just imagine the mods! And the graphical options! While it hasn't happened yet, I'm hoping we get some form of announcement in early 2023, perhaps via a State of Play. This feels like a sure thing at this point.

Yes! Our hearts were racing as we watched Pepper zip and zoom around with her trusty power tool. This is the high-speed sequel to Drill Dozer we've always wanted, and now we're getting it in 2023! She's even named her drill — Grinder.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["Cumulative global sell-in of amiibo figures has surpassed 77 million units."
Nintendo expanded upon their financial result release for the fiscal year ending in 2023 today, and provided a closer look at some of their best-performing individual IP. One such look was at amiibo, which have slowed down considerably since their 2014 debut: but still persist nonetheless.
Here's what Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa had to say about amiibo:
"Next, I would like to discuss amiibo, which we launched in 2014. Tapping an amiibo to an NFC touchpoint on hardware can have all kinds of fun results in compatible games, such as the in-game appearance of the amiibo character or special items. We continue to release new amiibo products each year, and cumulative global sell-in of amiibo figures has surpassed 77 million units."

Most of it is a boiler plate statement to keep investors interested in the idea of amiibo, but reading between the lines, Nintendo has no real reason to give up on the initiative yet. They're seemingly still selling, and the statement hints considerably at keeping the amiibo side of the business alive; at least in the short term.
If you're curious about what the future holds for amiibo: as always, you can check out when those were released here in our master amiibo list, which has been updated since 2014. In the short term, the Splatoon 3 amiibo are just around the corner, and are scheduled to arrive on November 11.

Blizzard Entertainment's Overwatch 2 engaged over 35 million players in its first month of release, it has been revealed via Activision Blizzard's most recent financial report. The team-based shooter sequel, which went free-to-play upon launch, hit PC and console platforms on October 4.
The number is more than double that of the title's predecessor, which pulled in some 15 million players during its first month of release back in 2016. Of course, this comparison is somewhat suspect, given that Overwatch was a full-priced title and its sequel is freely available to all. Still, the huge launch will be popular among the folks at Blizzard, and provides a very strong base for the developer to build upon.
Despite this success, however, the general conse…]]></summary>

As Sonic zooms into a semi open-world adventure with Sonic Frontiers, the "greatest hits" of the genre comes with it: which includes a fishing minigame. But given the historical significance (depending on who you ask) of Big the Cat, you could argue it actually fits here.
Here's a quick guide on how to approach fishing in the game.

In Sonic Frontiers, fishing has to be done at fish icons on the map
So you can't just get a special fishing rod item and fish anywhere on the map: but by that same token, the minigame doesn't require you to get a unique fishing rod either. You'll come across specific locations where you can initiate a minigame, hosted by Big the Cat. It'll be denoted by a fish icon on the map.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I love tidying up in games, and I’m not just talking about playing Unpacking and House Flipper, either. Any game I play with an inventory gets a regular, satisfying purge. I’m either marching to an in-game shopkeeper and holding my adventuring sack upside down, or just swiftly frisbeeing items straight into the bin. If it’s cluttering my screen, it’s cluttering my mind. Zero regrets. That’s the gamer dopamine hit I’m chasing.
So, as you might have guessed, I love the idea of A Little To The Left, a game that celebrates neatness and tidiness through a string of fun puzzles. If you love the satisfaction of arranging books on your shelf in order of height, or displaying your mugs in order of which can hold the most tea, then you’ll love this game too. Some simple tidying puzzles would have been enough for me, but A Little To The Left takes the idea in interesting directions through smart puzzle design.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Monster in my Pocket
Legendary publisher Capcom has announced that it will be partnering with Tencent subsidiary TiMi Studio Group to co-develop a new mobile title set within the high-adventure world of Monster Hunter.
In an incredibly brief statement, which was very scant on the details, TiMi Studio Group stated its excitement at the project, noting how the new title would offer up all of the adventure and giant slaying action of smash-selling releases such as Monster Hunter World and Monster Hunter Rise, newly scaled down for mobile devices and offering eager hunters "the freedom to hunt as they desire, anytime and anywhere."
No further information on the project was made available, including a title or release window, which suggests that the new project may be yet to even begin development. TiMi Studio has had experience with the handling of major gaming IPs before, having worked on mobile spin-offs such as Pokemon Unite, Call of Duty Mobile, and The King of Fighters: Destiny. The studio is perhaps best known for its controversial, government-bothering MMO Honor of Kings, which happens to be one of the most financially lucrative mobile games ever made.
For immediate monster-hunting thrills, Monster Hunter Rise is available now on PC and Nintendo Switch.

Having launched earlier this year on a couple of non-Switch platforms (yeah, apparently they exist!), Sloclap's Sifu has garnered much praise in the months since. A punishing 3D beat 'em up with roguelike elements and other genre ingredients, it struck a chord with PC and PlayStation-owning action fans and has been mentioned throughout the year in the same breath as that everpresent gaming acronym, 'GOTY'.
The game is now out on Switch, and the version on Nintendo's console delivers the core experience admirably — we called it "a more than valid option for Nintendo-only gamers" in our 8/10 review, and were pleasantly surprised to see how well it migrated to more modest, portable hardware.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just do it in an app
Back in my day, our 3D Sonic games had Chao Gardens. OK, so maybe it was only really for Sonic Adventure 2, and anyone who was caught in that web at the time just eternally associates Chaos with Sonic (ha). To be fair, they have appeared in various games as mascots of sorts, and as several higher-ups in Sega have pointed out: they are present in spinoffs like Team Sonic Racing. Sadly, Sonic Frontiers continues the trend of not having an in-game Chao Garden. But I think it's time to change that.
I know some of you are probably sighing at the idea of digging up an old 3D Sonic trend, but there's so much potential here. Most people liked the Chao Adventure gimmick with the VMU, right? While not quite a "garden" per se, the idea of getting a whole extra game within a game was mind blowing at the time. I mean, the VMU was way ahead of its time too, but learning that you just bought Sonic Adventure and got a free digital Tamagotchi pet was insane: and part of the reason why the Dreamcast earned its reputation as a quirky and enduring console. All of that can be done within an app now, which can interact with any given future Sonic entry.
Funnily enough, producer for Sonic Frontiers, Takashi Iizuka, laughed when asked about Chaos earlier this year. Game Informer spoke to him with a "rapid fire" question format, and asked "is there a Chao Garden in the game," he replied firmly with a "no." The next rapid fire question was "are Chaos just extinct at this point?" which he also replied with "no," while laughing. You can find that segment here at this timestamp (4:50).

The fantasy action RPG’s multiplayer was scuppered earlier this year when a security vulnerability that could harm anyone playing online was discovered all the way back in January. PC servers for Remastered were taken offline until a fix could be found, along with every other Dark Souls game.

They’re also touting more frequent updates to an FPS game that’s been relatively Spartan in terms of content, so far. Another game update is planned for later in 2022, which means Halo Infinite players can almost certainly expect something in December.

Ever thought inventory management in 2005’s Resident Evil 4 is like a game in its own right? Well, in the internet age, everything happens eventually, so here's that game. In Save Room from Fractal Projects, you have a limited and specifically shaped inventory space on the left and a load of guns and stuff on the right. Simply slot the guns into the space, like a military tangram puzzle.
You also need to ensure your health meter is full and your guns are loaded at the end of the stage. Easy: eat the bad stuff then eat the healing stuff; if a gun needs ammo, put the ammo in it. You may need to combine herbs or gunpowders first, but it's all monkey-trainable stuff. Once thus pared down, simply slot the guns and herbs into the space, like a drug dealer's jigsaw.

While beauty is, obviously, in the eye of the beholder, I am a huge fan of the character designs for Street Fighter 6 — The underground flavor appeals to me, bringing dazzling life and personality to our posse of World Warriors. Still, like many fans, I was hoping to see further evidence of some classic (or "nostalgia") skins, allowing our heroes and villains to rock their more iconic wardrobes.
And we have just gotten our first real look of said gear, courtesy of yer boy Ken Masters.
The newest issue of Game Informer has a stylish cover, which sees the down-and-out millionaire dropping his construction garb and donning his iconic red karate gi. This cover image marks the first official shot Capcom has released spotlighting a new character model wearing an alternate skin. Better yet, if you check out Game Informer's "Cover Story" video, you can also glimpse some over-the-shoulder footage of both Chun-Li and Ryu throwing down whilst kitted out in their own classic SFII garb.
It's somewhat early for Capcom to be showing off these nostalgia skins, especially if they are scheduled to be released as paid DLC. In my previous "Do's and Do Not Do's" article, I noted that it would be wise for the publisher to offer players something in the way of a reward for playing through Arcade/Story mode, suggesting that nostalgia costumes would be a respectable prize. While these images are no confirmation that the classic gear will be bundled with the game at launch, it's difficult not to get excited. After all, the studio is doing a damn fine job with SF6 so far.
Street Fighter 6 launches 2023 on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms. For further reading, check out the 50 things I loved in the beta, the leaked character roster, our Do’s and Do Not Do’s, and our look at specific characters including Guile, Juri, Kimberly, and Jamie & Luke.

While Switch owners unfortunately never saw a release for FromSoftware's critically acclaimed Dark Souls III, we've seen plenty from the franchise and wider 'Souls' genre with the launch of Dark Souls: Remastered and the pixel art homage Blasphemous.
Well, it now appears that Thomas Feichtmeir, an artist who worked on Blasphemous, actually once pitched an idea to publisher Bandai Namco for a 2D pixel art version of Dark Souls III. As spotted by our friends over at Time Extension, the revelation was revealed on Twitter with an accompanying mock-up screenshot added to demonstrate how the game might have looked.

It seems that Lego will also no longer be accepting ideas based on The Legend of Zelda, stating in an online message that "we have evaluated this IP and determined that we can't allow submissions based on it" (thanks, Brick Fanatics).

A lot of the statistics contained in the recent Nintendo financial report covered how successful the company had been in business terms, but equally important is what it is doing to combat climate change and its negative impact on the environment. Fortunately, the follow-up presentation outlined the steps that the company is making in this field, notably concerning energy usage in its consoles and reductions to unnecessary packaging.
The first of these points is less about what Nintendo is going to do to combat its energy consumption, and more about what it already has done on this front. The presentation notes how the Switch has continually reduced its energy usage since its release in 2017. While the original console released all those years ago would use (on average) 12w when played in docked mode, the current model only uses 7w and the OLED is even more efficient on 6w.

In the newest chapter of the epic tale surrounding the Prince of Persia: Sands of Time remake, publisher Ubisoft has further insisted that the missing-in-action adventure remains on track for future release, despite refunds having been issued to all of the title's pre-order customers.
First announced back in the summer of 2020, the newly visioned edition of the 2003 adventure game has been mired in development delay, leading several retailers to remove a release date or, in some cases, delist the product entirely from their websites. This week, pre-order customers noticed that their purchase had been refunded, further suggesting that the title had been quietly buried beneath the Persian dunes.

Noting this, Ubisoft opened a special FAQ page, hoping to answer the fans' questions and concerns over the fragile-looking release. According to the FAQ, the Prince of Persia: Sands of Time remake has not been canceled, and remains in development at Ubisoft Montreal, (the studio gaining control of the project from its brethren Ubisoft Mumbai). Ubisoft says that refunds were issued due to a total lack of availability on an expected release date.
Elsewhere in the FAQ, Ubisoft also notes that it has no plans to remake any other classic Prince of Persia titles. Given the rigmarole the publisher has experienced with Sands of Time to date, I can imagine that the franchise is currently on the "Do Not Mention" list within the studio's walls
Prince of Persia: Sands of Time is, (apparently), in development at Ubisoft.

Yesterday we got our peepers on the Nintendo financial report covering Q2 of the fiscal year ending March, 2023, and there was a lot to unpack. If the highest-selling Switch games, digital download data and upcoming release dates weren't enough to wet your whistle, however, then fear not as we have even more statistics from the report today.
The follow-up six-month findings presentation has now been published, outlining lots of big numbers like amiibos sold to date and how many people are now on NSO. One stat that really stood out to us, though, was the number of active Switch users in the past year (from October, 2021 to September, 2022 - yep, it's confusing), the total of which has been reported to be 106 million players!

Update :
After the below article went live, it came to our attention that the data supplied by Nintendo might actually be more inaccurate than we'd initially believed. As pointed out by Colm Larkin over on Twitter (and indeed by a few of our own clever community members), the sharp spike at the twenty two year-old section might actually be due to a number of users simply selecting a birth year of 2000, either out of sheer laziness or a weird way to cheat the system. Either way, it's an interesting point to note:

Sony recently increased the price of the PlayStation 5 in select markets around the world. Since then, fans of certain other platforms have also questioned if it will happen to their own system of choice.
Nintendo has already ruled out the idea of possible Switch price increases on a few occasions in August, and now it's said it once again during its latest financial update. Game and tech reporter Takashi Mochizuki highlighted how Nintendo had no current plans to increase prices but would continue to monitor the current situation, and consider if action needs to be taken.

Welcome back! It’s another Tuesday, which means tonight there will be a new episode of Spot Dodge: A Live Nintendo Podcast exclusively on Destructoid. Topics: It's been quite the year of disappointing video games. From CrossfireX to Babylon's Fall, in tonight's opening topic we discuss the worst games of the year. The crew also discusses the recent Pokemon Scarlet and Violet leaks and Square Enix's major NFT blunder. All of that and so much more on Spot Dodge!
Video game development cycles are getting longer. The days of receiving three Uncharted games in the span of five years are over. So when a highly anticipated game ends up being aggressively mediocre, it hurts, even more, knowing you won't see the studio's next effort until five to ten years later. …]]></summary>

Popeye was the best thing to ever happen to spinach, and all it had to do was imply that eating a can would let you punch a train. Why did no other vegetable consider this?

We should really see more advergames. Let me tell you, I hate advertising. Seeing it in video game form, on the other hand, really lets you appreciate how insipid it is. Cool Spot had nothing to do with 7up, and McDonald’s Treasureland Adventure didn’t have a hamburger in sight. UFO Kamen Yakisoban has it right.

With wide-screen 1440p (3440x1440) resolution and a 175Hz refresh rate, it's both detailed and responsive, and it looks the part too with a very cool space-y design. 
I was lucky enough to review one for several months for Digital Foundry - I think Dell forgot about it for a while - so I consider it my duty to inform you that it is now on sale for the first time ever, dropping from £1099 to £943 - still a big chunk of change, but a fitting Black Friday price for one of the best monitors on the market of any description, hands down.

Skyrim also has a robust modding community, so though aspects of the game might be dated now, you can make some changes to get your gaming experience to your exact specifications. If even that isn't enough to keep your Skyrim playthroughs feeling fresh, then maybe it's time to move onto something new.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hand in hand, in hand
As part of its newly published financial details, Nintendo has announced that it is entering into a joint venture with mobile gaming company DeNA. In a statement that, frankly, reads like it was written by an algorithm, Nintendo announced that it hopes to both expand user communication and improve upon all the services delivered by the "Nintendo Account" system.
"With the integrated hardware-software model at the core of its business, Nintendo also strives to provide enhanced experience and service outside of its dedicated gaming system," begins perhaps the most buzzword statement in existence. "In order to provide this experience in a holistic manner, Nintendo is working to maintain and expand its relationship with consumers primarily through Nintendo Account. Based on the expertise accumulated over the seven-plus years and the experience of co-developing multiple services based on Nintendo Account, Nintendo and DeNA will advance their partnership and establish a joint venture company."
"With the objective to strengthen the digitalization of Nintendo’s business, the joint venture company will research and develop, as well as create value-added services to further reinforce Nintendo’s relationship with consumers."
This is not Nintendo's first dealings with DeNA, the latter having been closely involved with multiple Nintendo mobile games, including Fire Emblem Heroes, Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp, Super Mario Run, and Mario Kart Tour. DeNA is, in particular, responsible for the integration of player accounts and in-game communications. As partners, the two companies hope to research and develop more advanced technology and software for future Nintendo mobile titles and/or applications.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Press in the left analog stick near rings
So Sonic Frontiers is out today, and there's a lot little nuances that don't matter (especially with the variety of combat abilities), and there's some that do. Making sure that you remember that the Light Speed Dash ability even exists can be huge in terms of minute-to-minute Frontiers play.
Unlike a heap of powers in Sonic Frontiers, that need to either be unlocked via the skill tree or story progression, you can Light Speed Dash immediately. All you need to do is press the left analog stick in when you're near a trail of rings, and Sonic will instant micro-dash (without a boost meter requirement) toward said ring formation. You can use the Light Speed Dash to get some extra air when Sonic is falling, collect a lot of rings quickly during a fight, or solve some puzzles.
I literally played hours of the game not recalling that this technique existed. I even quickly an inadvertently did a load screen tutorial sequence with it, and still forgot about it for a bit! Given that it's largely not needed to get around (double-jumping and a breezy R2/RT dash take care of that), it is easy to block out of your mind.
But like me, you'll probably come across some situation where you're falling and quickly remember: the Light Speed Dash exists.

Those currently swingin' mallets and tossing pies in the madcap world of MultiVersus will be given the opportunity to go for the brass ring real soon, as Player First Games has kicked off the first test period for the brawler's long-awaited Ranked Mode.
As of 09:00 PT / 12:00 ET / 18:00 BST, players will be able to jump into the temporary Alpha, which will be offering up a full week of ranked play in order for the developer to test the ins and outs of the new system. Ranked Mode will see players' win/loss ratio count toward an overall leaderboard standing, a feature that much of the MultiVersus community has been asking for some time now. Of course, standard multiplayer battles will also remain available during the course of Ranked alpha and beyond.

WayForward is still showing out the upcoming roster of River City Girls 2 — We already know that Kunio, Riki, and Double Dragon's Marian will be joining Kyoko & Misako on their latest rampage through the thug-filled 'berg, and now we can take a look at sixth scrapper Provie, rounding out our raucous roster.
If this cool-looking lass feels familiar, then you might have seen her kicking ass and taking names in Conatus Creative's cult 2017 release River City Ransom: Underground, where she made a name for herself as a hip-hop lovin' pop 'n' lockin' fighter — having combined her love of breakdancing with Brazilian martial art capoeira. Taking time out from her own vigilante squad, "The Flock", Provie will be ably helping the River City Girls in their fist-flinging battle against the powerful Sabu crime family.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9rJZMWam-A
River City Girls 2 was first revealed way back in the summer of 2021, with the team at WayForward drip-feeding characters, features, and rad new 'choons since the title's initial reveal. While we are still yet to receive a western release date for the sequel's launch, (it's getting a little tight on that "2022" release date now). The sequel, though similar in design to the 2020 original, will feature several new features including simultaneous four-player co-op action, and a variety of stylishly designed new boss characters.
River City Girls 2 is in development for PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms. Be sure to check out our previous write-ups on both River City Girls and River City Girls Zero, as well as our interviews with director Adam Tierney, and awesome composer Megan McDuffee.

Recent bullet-pumping sequel Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II continues to smash all-time series records, with the stunning revelation that Activision's latest military shooter has raked in a staggering $1 billion USD in revenue within its first 10 days of release.
This financial feat is just the latest in a series of records broken by Modern Warfare II, which is already the fastest-selling entry in the series to date and also broke the storied franchise's milestone for Most Concurrent Steam Users, (with a peak of 263,174 players on launch night). The previous record to hit the Big Billion was held by the excellent 2012 entry Call of Duty: Black Ops 2, which hit the 10-digit mark in 15 days.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeVapCrI1pY
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II continues the reboot/reboot storyline that began with 2019's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare. The plot details a violent, globe-trotting campaign that sees Task Force 141, once again headed up by Captain Price, attempt to dismantle a dangerous arms cartel that threatens to bring death and destruction to the United States. In curious fashion, the game works as both a brand new title and a prequel to the previous Modern Warfare releases from the mid-'00s.
Following on from the relatively blah welcoming received by 2021's Call of Duty Vanguard. Activision will no doubt be breathing a sigh of relief that, for now at any rate, the Call of Duty franchise remains untarnished from both a popularity and financial standpoint, with MWII's success likely pointing to further years of entries in one of the industry's most lucrative franchises.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is available now on PlayStation, PC (Steam/Battle.net), and Xbox.

There’s something about a physical controller, custom built to emulate the action the game revolves around, that lends games a level of credibility you lose the second you try and play it with a regular pad. Playing Guitar Hero with an Xbox 360 controller feels like trying to paint a bedroom wall using a spoon. You’ll get there eventually, but if anyone spots you through a window they’ll rightly assume you’re some kind of deviant.

Just recently, Nintendo finally dropped a Direct and dumped a ton of new info, remakes, and Nintendo 2023 first party release dates into our lap. Now, a new financial report for the fiscal year ending in March 2023 is backing up what we found out in September: with hopefully no delays in sight.
So there's a few things to note here. Pikmin 4 is still just "2023" without a window in mind: which seems perfect for an E3 release date announcement for Q3 or Q4. Metroid Prime 4 (which is still a working title, or notated as "temp" in the financial report) is in the works and doesn't even have a year in mind. Plus, Advance Wars 1+2 Re-Boot Camp is "TBA" as of November 2022.
As far as other regions go, Europe seems to be on the same timeline as the US. Japan is welcoming Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope (which most of the world already has) on December 2, and the Re-Boot Camp "TBA" listing is completely missing. No doubt we'll get more info and maybe even another Direct as we head into early 2023.
Nintendo's 2023 first party Switch release dates:
Fire Emblem Engage - 1/20/2023
Kirby's Return to Dream Land Deluxe - 2/24/2023
The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom - 5/12/2023
Pikmin 4 - 2023
Metroid Prime 4 - TBA
Advance Wars 1+2 Re-Boot Camp - TBA

You’d think being lucky enough to actually play the damn thing would have numbed my hyper-fixation about it a touch, but, nope. I’m afraid not. It turns out the guy who owns eight physical copies (and four digital) of the original Resident Evil 4 is still pretty excited to play the remake. Who ever could have predicted this?


The day my preview went live, Capcom showed off a couple of additional bits as part of a hefty Resident Evil showcase. Alongside a fresh story trailer the company also discussed the various gubbins you’ll receive if you fork out for the game's special edition as well as a short gameplay demonstration. Surprising no one, I’ve watched these clips so many times I now have a load of thoughts that are not only completely useless but are taking up vital brain space I usually reserve for things like pin numbers and dates. If I don’t vent all of this garbage out of my skull there’s a chance I’ll forget my Mam’s birthday again, something that genuinely happened once when I was 17 and I haven’t stopped feeling guilty about it since. I bought her a plant from a Tesco Express three days later thinking that would help. It didn’t. This event haunts me more than any Resident Evil jumpscare ever could.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blacktail is a complicated, first-person adventure when you play a lil witch. Well, a witch in training, sort of. A witcheen. Baba Yaga has been forced to live in the forest having been accused of witchcraft, so it seems like one of those self-fulfilling prophecy deals.
It's a very brightly coloured, fantastical world, this forest you live in, and you're dropped in media res. I thought that hands-on preview I got would be quite a casual gadabout talking to a cute dragon and what have you, but in fact it was difficult, and weird, and very opaque in the best way. The res in question included treasure chests with teeth and talking pine-cone spirits, and exploding fireflies. But you're an archer, too, and I really, really hate using arrows in first-person, and I don't think that will change.

This new look at Pokémon Scarlet and Violet was mostly focused on Ed Sheeran’s new Pokémon single “Celestial,” but it also included a few Big Nuggets of information we learned for the first time. The most significant reveal is a glimpse at two new creatures, called Great Tusk and Iron Treads. At first glance, they look a lot like Donphan (a Pokémon that has been confirmed for the new games), but it’s unclear how they’re related. They could be new regional forms, evolutions, or something entirely new.
The trailer also showed a sneak peek at the Scarlet Book and Violet Book, two tomes detailed further on Pokémon’s official website. They’re records from an old expedition and have notes and drawings of old Pokémon, including the new Donphan-esque creatures reve…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pump the Brakes
Electronic Arts, in an internal statement acquired by GamesIndustry.biz, has announced that it is ending the Project CARS racing franchise, effective immediately. This makes the final release in the simulation series the mobile title Project CARS GO, which launched on iOS and Android in 2021.
"Today we announced internally an update to our racing portfolio. Following an evaluation of the next Project CARS title and its longer-term growth potential, we have made the decision to stop further development and investment for the franchise," reads the statement. "Decisions like these are very hard, but allow us to prioritise our focus in areas where we believe we have the strongest opportunity to create experiences that fans will love."
"We are working with everyone impacted by this decision to place them into suitable roles across our EA Sports and racing portfolio, as well as other parts of EA, wherever we can. Our priority now is on providing as much support as possible to our people through this transition."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BPzkjvV_Rk
The Project CARS IP became the property of EA following the purchase of Codemasters and its subsidiaries, (including CARS developer Slightly Mad Studios), in December 2020. At the time of purchase, Slightly Mad had somewhere in the region of 150 employees, and so here's to hoping that EA will ensure new roles for the studio's staff throughout its myriad other development and publishing wings.
There have been four Project CARS games in total, including Project CARS GO. Though the first two games received critical and fan acclaim, Project CARS 3 was less warmly received. Earlier this year, it was announced that the first two titles were to be delisted from sale due to the expiration of in-game licenses, and it would seem that EA has decided that this particular racer has run its course.

In what can only be described as a campaign of diminishing returns, The Pokemon Company has been advertising semi-regular morning videos for Pokemon Scarlet and Violet for some time now. They usually air at 9AM ET, and show off a variety of in-game shenanigans: both on the small and large ends of the content spectrum. Today is one of the former days.
Simply put, here is the hype message we got yesterday from the game's official Twitter account: "Calling all Trainers! A new #PokemonScarletViolet trailer arrives tomorrow! Tune in to our YouTube channel at 6:00 a.m. PT on 11/8 for the latest news! Don’t forget to subscribe and turn on notifications—you won’t want to miss this." And the thing you want want to miss? An Ed Sheeran AMV (anime music video) with Scarlet and Violet footage. That's literally it.
Set to the tune of the Ed Sheeran song "Celestial" (which debuted at the end of September), the new video embedded below is basically just a standard trailer, complete with things we've seen before. Exploration, the three core storylines, the legendary mount Pokemon, and terastallizing (the new change mechanic) are all on display.
We're clearly in the home stretch here!

Sonic Frontiers DLC is already available in some form before its November 8 release date: by way of a Soap shoes-esque cosmetic add-on through the game's official site. You might recognize them from Sonic Adventures 2!
Here's the full details from Sega:
"Sign up by January 31, 2023 and get in-game content exclusively available to our newsletter subscribers*! Simply enter your details and we'll email a code straight to your inbox after Sonic Frontiers has been released on November 8, 2022. We’ll send more details about the in-game content and how to redeem your code to download the in-game content at a later date.* Available in selected regions for a limited time only. Sonic Frontiers game (sold separately) necessary to access in-game content. Gaming device must be connected to the internet to download in-game content."

If you want the SA2 shoes, you can go to the bottom of the official site here, and click "subscribe to the newsletter." From there it'll ask you to enter your email, date of birth, country, and what platform you'd like to get the in-game DLC on (which includes Switch, PC [Epic/Steam], PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S).
While we still don't have any major details on how equipment will work (or the "Blue Seeds of Defense/Red Seeds of Power" bonuses from the pre-order incentive), it seems like it'll be a self-explanatory transmog system. The same goes for the Blue Seeds of Defense and Red Seeds of Power, which will likely boost Sonic's resilience and attack damage respectively.
[Update: With the game launching this week, we figured it was good to get a reminder up! You can still sign up for the shoe DLC, it'll just roll out "24-48 hours" after signing up, according to the site.]

You can interpret “full premium release” to mean an actual game that costs $70, or an expansion packaged and sold during the ritually observed Call Of Duty release window. I choose to sit on the fence for the next 12 months, carefully raising one eyebrow so I don’t topple over.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[How To Say Goodbye starts with someone dying. It’s not shocking or distressing; quite the opposite. The person died in a hospital bed surrounded by their closest friends and family, and after they've passed on the group begins to share stories and memories from when they were alive. Death isn’t always this calm and it isn’t always this peaceful, but on rare occasions it can be. 
This is how developers Florian Veltman and Baptiste Portefaix have approached death in How To Say Goodbye, a cosy game that explores the topic with kindness and sensitivity. With its paper doll illustrations and pastel colour palette, it kinda feels like a children's pop-up book that teaches kids about grief. It’s not overly sweet or patronising, just a gentle game about a group of ghosts who discover how to mourn, how to accept their own death, and how to move on.

Enterprising Shepard stans set to work cleaning up the noise to see if anything meaningful was held within and, lo and behold, there was a short message from everyone’s favourite asari scientist Liara T’Soni.

While much of the 3D action remains intact through Sonic Frontiers, the arena in which much of that action takes place is a massive departure. The open-zone setup gives players large areas in which to run, fight, and explore, but the game also presents players with linear Cyber Space stages that veer much closer to the action levels players are used to. With so much to do in Sonic Frontiers (I spent more than 30 hours clearing as much as I could off the map), I wanted to give players some tips to help them squeeze the most fun out of the Blue Blur's enjoyment.

Zombie Hunter looks like a fake game. You know the opening of No More Heroes III where Travis Touchdown outlines this weird Deathman game, and the gamer part of your brain tells you that such a game couldn’t exist in the time period it’s supposedly from? That’s Zombie Hunter. It tells me it’s from 1987, but doesn’t really tell me it was developed by Lenar. Instead, it just mentions Hi-Score Media Work Corp, which was sued out of existence by Enix over a screenshot of Dragon Quest 2. I know this, because the first thing the game does upon being started is scream at you, “Hai Sukoa!” It was a nice jumpscare to start the game.

That's a lot of UI

Unsurprisingly, much is meant to be left to the players' imagination, but Peklar did offer some details, like how it managed to create something so abstract, some of the incidental imagery that occurred, and the best movie from the Aliens franchise.

The streaming giant revealed the news in a tweet that's light on details but states it's partnering with Gears developer The Coalition.

The last NFL Blitz was released on PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade in January 2012. Even then, it was considered a retro revival title developed by Madden studio EA Tiburon. Before that, we hadn't received a proper NFL-licensed Blitz title since Midway's NFL Blitz 20-03 on PlayStation 2, Xbox, GameCube, and Game Boy Advance. Despite EA Sports acquiring the license from Midway during its 2009 liquidation, the NFL has largely seemed averse to the hard-hitting arcade-style gameplay of the Blitz series.

A bit bland and archaic, lacking that colour and pop that the likes of Apex Legends and Valorant possess.

That’s why I’m intrigued by Chop Goblins, a “microshooter” from Dusk and Gloomwood developer David Szymanski that’s coming to Steam on January 2nd, 2023.

The World War One FPS has been spotted nestled in Steam’s top ten best-selling games rankings (thanks, Emopulse), although it's since slipped out again. Battlefield 1’s also set a record over the weekend for its all-time highest concurrent player numbers, reaching more than 50,000 players in the past 24 hours. I say, tip top.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I can't remember now if it was Monster Prom or Dream Daddy that introduced me to the dating sim genre, but Monster Prom was definitely my first dating sim hybrid, a sub-genre I'm now more than a bit obsessed with. Other favourite examples of mine include last year's Boyfriend Dungeon (a dating sim and dungeon crawler), Max Gentlemen: Sexy Business (a dating and business sim), and HuniePop (a dating sim and match-3 puzzle game). Monster Prom is a dating sim and competitive multiplayer party game, where up to four players vie to romance attractive monsters and invite them to the school dance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Standing here, I realize that this Super Replay will be a cut above the rest because we’ll be slicing and dicing in Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance! Join us today on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central to enjoy two hours of what will be a full playthrough of the cult favorite action game streaming weekly each Friday. You can also catch up on previous episodes by visiting our new Game Informer Shows YouTube channel or watching the latest episode embedded below. 
Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance serves as a sequel/spin-off to Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots that puts cyborg ninja Raiden at the helm. Instead of sneaking around in boxes, players eviscerate foes in fast-paced, stylish action courtesy of developer Platinum Games. Since its launch in 2013, Revengence’s action and absurdity have garnered it a passionate internet fandom, but I have a little secret: I didn’t think the game was all that special when I played it at launch. However, years of being inundated with internet memes and being told my opinion is incorrect has inspired me to give Revengece another look. Will I acquire a new appreciation for the game nine years later? How many watermelons will I slice? You’ll have to tune in to find out. 


Join me, Marcus Stewart, and Blake Hester as we revisit Raiden’s beloved solo adventure. If you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes. You’ll also be granted entry to the official Game Informer Discord channel, where our welcoming community members, moderators, and staff gather to talk games, entertainment, food, and organize hangouts!]]></summary>

RimWorld is the more direct influence, really. Instead of a planet's surface, your little blobby torso people are stuck on a spaceship, which you need to rebuild around them using a fleet of robots as they gradually wake up from stasis. If you know the genre well, it will be reminiscent of several games, but its balance of survival, management, and creative building makes for a refreshingly forgiving experience at the current default settings.

Kaye’s nonchalant accent seems like a great fit, as you’ll see in the trailer below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been an interesting exercise playing Triangle Strategy and Tactics Ogre: Reborn in quick succession lately. I've now played both Square Enix strategy RPGs for around six hours apiece now - starting with Tactics Ogre for my preview the other week, and following it up with a Triangle-shaped chaser. I didn't have any history with either game before now, but it's become increasingly apparent that they're effectively cut from the same tile-based cloth. And I mean, exactly the same. They're so similar, in fact, that it's kinda hilarious Square are releasing them so close together on PC, with Tactics Ogre's release on November 11th following little more than a month after Triangle Strategy. 
At the same time, though, their approach to story-telling couldn't be more different, and comparing and contrasting them like this one after the other has been both fun and enlightening. Triangle Strategy, for example, is about 80% cutscene, 20% fighting for its first six hours, while Tactics Ogre is pretty much the opposite. And yet… I think I sort of prefer Triangle Strategy? Let me explain.

A PS5 demo came out and I only got to spend all of five minutes with it before life got in the way. I never got to truly taste the jam, which was quite sad. So, colour me very excited when I got to spend a good couple of hours battling through two short hands-on demos. I got battered by a big pig, prickled to death by a massive porcupine, and aggressively mauled by a large tiger. And I'd say I had a whale of a time. There was no killer whale in the demo, but I wouldn't count it out for the full release.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[God of War Ragnarok is out next week and ahead of the game's release, developer Santa Monica Studio has revealed more than 70 accessibility features in the game. 
PlayStation has been pushing the importance of accessibility in gaming more and more with each new release and Ragnarok is no different. The studio has been quite open with its accessibility desires, detailing more than 60 in a blog post earlier this year. Now, with the game out on November 9, the studio has released an even more detailed post breaking down exactly what to expect. 


Santa Monica Studio says there are more than 70 features in Ragnarok that "enable players to customize the gameplay experience to suit their needs" and the list is a sight to behold. It includes plenty of presets, too, which could make it easier for players to easily get the game started in a way that makes the experience better for them. Presets include one for vision accessibility, hearing accessibility, motion reduction, apply motor accessibility, and a changed setting indicator as well. 
There are alternative control schemes, remappable buttons, hold and press options, in-game assistance settings, and so much more. If you're interested in what accessibility features are in Ragnarok, be sure to check out the full blog post. 
For more, read Game Informer's God of War Ragnarok review and then check out all of the performance and quality modes for the game.

        <updated>2022-11-04T12:28:21.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The composer for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II, Sarah Schachner, has revealed that she has parted ways with the game and the free-to-play battle royale Call of Duty: Warzone (and likely the upcoming Warzone 2). As for why, she says the working dynamic with the game's audio director has become difficult and she sees no path forward. Variety reports that the audio director in question is Stephen Miller but Schachner doesn't name this person in her announcement. 
News of her departure comes from a statement released by Schachner on Twitter on November 3, as reported by Video Games Chronicle. Schachner's departure comes after years of work with Modern Warfare II studio Infinity Ward on games like 2019's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare and 2016's Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare. Other credits include Assassin's Creed Valhalla and Anthem, as noted by VGC. 
"I am sad to say I can no longer continue to compose music for MWII/Warzone," her statement reads. "Over the past couple of months, the working dynamic with the audio director has become increasingly challenging and I don't see any path forward. As of now, I am unsure of the status and release plan for the soundtrack as it's been taken out of my hands. While I don't have any control over how the music is presented in-game, what will be released on the soundtrack is not my artistic intent in regards to mixing and mastering." 
She then thanks fans for their support and gives some shout outs to others involved with the game's score, including mixer Frank Wolf, "creative vision" Mike Dean, and performing artists including Baseck, Brain Mantia, and M.B. Gordy.

These are both high-end GPUs, set to cost $899 and $999 respectively when they release on December 13th, but you’ll note those prices are oodles cheaper than the £1269 / $1199 RTX 4080 and the £1679 / $1599 RTX 4090.
They’re also structurally distinct from the current Radeon RX 6000 cards to an extent that, frankly, is quite surprising to see from AMD GPUs. RDNA 3 uses a Ryzen CPU-inspired chiplet design, where the GPU is split up into different sections, and the new media engine is engineered for the 4K gaming monitors of the future as much as it is for current PC hardware.

Developers Second Dinner told the Washington Post that an update to the free to play PC and mobile game that pits superpowered heroes and villains from the Marvel Universe against each other would be landing before 2023 begins. That’s cool and all, but if you’ve got thirty seconds then do yourself a favour and watch the virtually superhero-free Japanese trailer for Marvel Snap below, too.

Pulsating lights stretch in a vertical column from the top to the bottom of my screen, scattering into deadly particles like notes played on an accordion of cosmic destruction. Fireworks burst in every corner, thanks to the evolved version of my diamond-spewing runetracer weapon that’s now called ‘NO FUTURE’. Monsters go pop by their thousands. Flaming meteors still abound.
Vampire Survivors is an arcade-style survivathon about weaving through fields of enemies as your weapons automatically obliterate the oncoming hordes. It’s still about collecting upgrades until you’re the locus of an unstoppable death machine, and now that it’s left early access that death machine comes in more colours and more flavours. There are new maps to conquer, new characters to conquer with, and new secrets to uncover. If you haven’t played since the early access launch then yes, it’s worth checking out the new stuff. If you haven’t played at all, then God yes, please check out all the stuff. Or like, most of it.
Vampire Survivors is still morish. Up to a point.

        <updated>2022-11-03T20:01:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft has rolled out its post-launch content roadmap for Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope. Owners of the game’s season pass, whether purchased separately for $29.99 or bundled in the game’s $89.99 Gold Edition, have three big adventures aimed at keeping them glued to the game throughout 2023. 
It all kicks off early next year with the first expansion, Tower of Doooom (their spelling, not mine). This introduces a new combat mode where the team must fight their way up Madame Bwahstrella’s multi-story tower to rescue Spawny, the visor-rocking Rabbid from Kingdom Battle. What’s important to note is that Tower of Doooom will be exclusive to the season pass, meaning you’ll be unable to purchase it separately. 
The second untitled DLC arrives in mid-2023. So far, we only know it takes players to a new planet, features never-before-seen enemies, allies, and secrets, and stars a new antagonist. Finally, Rayman crashes the party in the final expansion to close out the year. Ubisoft’s limbless hero joins Rabbid Peach and Rabbid Mario on a separate adventure in a new location. Unlike Tower of Doooom, the second and third expansions can be purchased a la carte. 
I enjoyed Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope quite a bit, awarding it a 9 out of 10. In my review, which you can read here, I wrote that the game “builds upon Kingdom Battle’s foundation with smart tweaks and fun additions to emerge as a better game in every way.”]]></summary>

Abandoned was announced with a short teaser back in 2021 as a game being developed for PlayStation 5 and PC. Not long after the reveal, speculation that Abandoned was actually a Silent Hill game secretly in development began to ramp up, but studio head Hasan Kahraman took to Twitter to shut down those rumors.
From there, the speculation train arrived at the idea that famed Metal Gear Solid developer Kojima was attached to the game. Some believed that Kojima actually was Kahraman on the basis that both their first names start with "H" and both their last names start with "K."

We've all been there at some point in our lives, painstakingly planning a grand day out only for it to absolutely tip it down on the day in question - and for the boy in Inasa Fujio's hour-long narrative game, it's a trip to the local theme park during his summer holidays that gets rained off. 
Unfortunately, his mum (sensibly) decides against taking him and his brother out in the oncoming storm, so now he's got to face a day stuck inside his grandma's house instead. FUN. Turns out, though, that there are still plenty of memories to be made in this small, cluttered space. All you need is a little imagination.

What if you could do that while being more ethically sound, in a non-lethal way? Hold onto your butts because vanilla Skyrim modder drumfire has come up with the solution.

Matthew being away this week means that Nate takes on the role of the anti-Matthew, and we speculate about which games we think Matthew would probably find relatable.

To call the 2018 God of War a sequel almost does it a disservice. Yes, it was a continuation of Kratos’ original multi-game journey, but it placed him and a new family in a foreign world to reflect on his past and try to secure his future. Kratos’ journey to connect to his son while battling a new legion of distrustful gods was a revelation in both video game storytelling and action, setting a high bar for the inevitable sequel. Ragnarök may lack the unique impact of the prior game, but everything that worked so well the…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been playing an awful lot of Overwatch 2 recently. As you'll know if you've played either of Blizzard's near-identical hero shooters, Overwatch 2 lets you queue up for a match as a particular hero role, which ensures balanced team compositions but also can mean a wait of several minutes before you get into a match. Cue me scouring my Steam Library a few days ago for a quick little time-waster to fill those gaps. And after a few failed attempts, I discovered it. Or, more accurately, rediscovered it.

Like a lot of specialised fonts, I find calligraphy awkward to read at best and virtually illegible at worst. That’s why I always appreciate when games make an effort to make text as accessible as possible. Case in point: Obsidian’s upcoming medieval mystery, Pentiment, which has an option to swtich to easy to read fonts baked in. Verily, thou hast mine thanks.

Inspired by classics like Resident Evil and Silent Hill, Heartworm is neat even before you learn it's almost entirely made by one person. It offers good times exploring a spooky house, bad times possibly trapped inside a neighbourhood in a VHS tape, and a very cosy time hanging out in the safe room. It is a lovely safe room.

Without spoiling the ending of Village, the story left off in a way that created some big, interesting questions about the future of Resident Evil. From its beginning, the series has never claimed a singular protagonist, but moving forward, it seemed Ethan’s daughter Rose was going to be an important character to the franchise and whatever narrative direction a potential Resident Evil IX might follow. The Shadows of Rose DLC offers the first chance to play as Rose while filling in a small story gap that arguably did not need filling. Even with a somewhat benign…]]></summary>

The thing is, if anything I don't think it's weird enough. If you're going to do a game where the main character uses flaming witchhazel sticks to lash energy-crystal monsters with vagina-flower faces, my view is that you go hard or go home.

As you can see, there's a lot going on in terms of graphics modes for this game, and that's great – the more options, the better! Regardless of where you play or how you play, it sounds like you're in for a good time based on the first five hours of the game. You can read what we thought about those first hours in our God of War Ragnarök spoiler-free impressions here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ghost Song is a 2D Metroid-like that's always a feast for the eyes, but a frequent frustration for your head and hands. Its gorgeous art direction depicts a vibrant alien world that bubbles and throbs with bio-mechanical life, where spore clouds and fleshy organic tunnels live side by side with floating metal skulls and impenetrable thickets of wires and cables. It's a fascinating place that seems to morph and change with every passing map segment, calling to mind the animated techno gunge of Akira and Metropolis one minute, and the flowering brilliance of Alex Garland's Annihilation the next. Its roots sink deep, creating a world you'll want to explore every last nook and cranny of as you delve deeper into its underbelly to find out why you're here.
But Deadsuit, your android-like protagonist, makes for a slightly rusty-feeling companion at times, lacking the grace and elegance of Nintendo's Samus Aran, and the nimble dexterity of Team Cherry's nameless knight. It will tide you over until Silksong arrives, for sure, but it also never quite sings in the way you'd hope.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When it comes to DDR4 RAM, the market has decided that 3200MT/s CL16 is the perfect spec: noticeably faster than early DDR4-2133, 2400 and 2666, while being significantly cheaper than higher-end 3400, 3600 and 4000 kits. Normally you'd expect to pay around £60 for a 16GB dual-channel kit of DDR4 RAM hitting this spec, but today you can get a Kingston Fury Beast 16GB kit for just £48.64 at CCL in the UK.

Many of my thoughts on Elden Ring have been positive, as I'm still awestruck by the quality and scope of its open world (among many other things). But I admitted I'd reached my exhaustion point, which abated briefly, then came back with full force by the end.
Honestly, as much as I admire the game and its brilliance, I reckon it might be a bit too much for me. And as FromSoftware set the Soulslike standard, I find myself hoping that future Soulslikes don't get too caught up in trying to mimick Elden Ring.

I don’t envy the developers of puzzle games. They have to create puzzles formidable enough to be challenging and exciting, but not so much that the player feels more burdened than empowered. The best walk that line almost perfectly, and The Entropy Centre is chock full of them. But The Entropy Centre is more than its brain teasers, and it’s that “more” where the game hits its stumbling blocks. Despite that, its core design is unlike anything I’ve ever played, and genre enthusiasts will find that this game be…]]></summary>

Fewer than 40 games are confirmed to implement it so far but that number is growing, with Nvidia today announcing that Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales will include DLSS 3 when it launches for PC on November 18th.

More specifically, the game will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on February 21, 2023. Developer Mundfish and publisher Focus Entertainment announced this news in a new and bloody gameplay trailer showcasing more of what to expect in the game early next year. 
Check out the Atomic Heart release date trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, Atomic Heart continues to look great in trailers and I can't wait to finally go hands-on with it in just four months, especially as a fan of BioShock. While Atomic Heart is doing its own thing, it's hard not to compare it to the BioShock series given the whole alternate reality thing, the types of guns on display here, the enemies we'll be facing, and the hand-controlled powers. 
Atomic Heart was revealed years ago, and there are plenty more trailers to watch if you're interested. Check out this 2020 gameplay trailer for an early look at the game, and then watch this 2021 trailer for a look at the creepier side of Atomic Heart. Find out why it's one of our most anticipated horror games after that, and then watch this action-packed combat trailer from earlier this summer. 
For additional information about Atomic Heart, be sure to check out Mundfish's official website, where there's info about the game's different editions available for preorder and more.

The snippet of info that the new Deus Ex game is in the very, very early stages was reported by Bloomberg following yesterday’s revelation that sister studio Onoma is closing down. Eidos Montreal are also alleged to be working on a completely new game, as well as helping out with some co-development on some Microsoft-owned series, including the new Fable.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As Replika Elster, Signalis will force you to untangle a mess of writhing flesh and malfunctioning memories to separate dream from lived experience. So, in keeping with dream logic: You’ve played Signalis before, and you’ve never played anything like it. It lovingly adopts the trappings of PS1-era survival horror, and more importantly, it fully understands why those systems, aesthetics, tropes, and technical limits are so engaging. But it also presents and explores love and loss, freedom and manipulation, fear and trauma, in its own cruelly captivating way. It’s strange and familiar, gorgeous and horrible. It’s an absolute banger of a videogame, made all the more impressive by its indiest of indies price tag and two-person dev team.
Fundamentally, it's a love story. Things go bad for space technician Elster, but she made a promise she intends to keep. We’ll get back to this later. First up: Signalis excels at capturing the essence of survival horror - those juxtaposed feelings of possibility and unease that hit you entering a long hallway, flanked by doors, only to find all but two locked or malfunctioning. You’ll be back here soon enough, you know that. Probably with a new key. Maybe with a new gun. But there’s also a good chance things will have…changed, by then. A floor tile might reveal new horrors. You might have spent your last bullet. So, left or right? Or maybe back? You can only carry six items, after all.

All this with PCIe 5.0 and DDR5 support, given the right motherboard - and this is a surprisingly great way to jump on 12th-gen, while leaving plenty of space to upgrade to a higher tier CPU down the road.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[According to a Bloomberg report, video game publisher Embracer has shut down Onoma, the studio formerly known as Square Enix Montreal, just months after its acquisition. Some staff will be transferred to Eidos Montreal, another studio owned by Embracer. This news comes just a few weeks after Onoma underwent a rebranding process where it adopted the new name.
Onoma was best known for its work on the Go series, turn-based spin-offs of popular Eidos Interactive titles designed for mobile. This includes Hitman Go, Lara Croft Go, and Deus Ex Go. Their most recent work was Tomb Raider Reloaded, which came to mobile devices earlier this year, and their future plans involved a title based on Avatar: The Last Airbender.
Earlier this year, Onoma was just one part of a much larger series of Embracer’s acquisitions, which included Crystal Dynamics and Eidos Montreal. In August, Embracer proceeded to acquire Limited Run Games, Tripwire Interactive, Tuxedo Labs, the IP rights to The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit, and several more studios.
The Bloomberg report also says that the closure is part of a cost-cutting initiative, and that Eidos Montreal will have projects scaled back and cut as well. Some of these resources will be redirected to assist in the development of a game in the Fable franchise, led by Playground Games.

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II is a very unpleasant game. Like every Call of Duty game, the majority of time spent playing involves either killing or being killed in horrendous ways, for one thing, and there’s a natural revulsion that comes from seeing so many gouts of blood shooting from bodies or the ragged slump of newly lifeless human corpses piled up in a doorway. And yet, the surface-level hideousness of its parade of death might not be so notably ugly if it wasn't for Modern Warfare II's cast of c…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The official Sonic the Hedgehog YouTube channel has uploaded an animated short titled “Sonic Frontiers Prologue: Divergence.” Starring Knuckles, the short reveals how he wound up on the island players explore in Sonic Frontiers. You can watch the six-minute animation in its entirety below.


In the trailer, Knuckles provides a voice-over explanation of his background up until now, including the fact that he was tasked with guarding the Master Emerald, a relic that hasn’t appeared in the Sonic series for quite some time. The trailer ends with Knuckles absolutely demolishing some robots, and while we’ve received no indication that he will be playable in Sonic Frontiers, that sequence makes me hope he will be.
Knuckles has been a core Sonic character for most of the franchise’s existence, so it’s not surprising that he’s making an appearance in the blue blur’s latest adventure. While this animated prologue gives us insight into how he wound up on the island, it’s still not entirely clear why, especially when it comes to the appearance of Sage (a new character introduced in Sonic Frontiers) at the end of the trailer. We’ll have to wait for the full game to find out.
The past month has been full of Sonic news. We got a December 14 release date for Sonic Prime, Sonic Frontiers got a trailer confirming Super Sonic would be playable in the game, and we learned that the Sonic series has sold over 1.5 billion copies worldwide. For more Sonic news, check out our cover story from earlier this year, and stay tuned for more Sonic Frontiers coverage when the game releases on November 8.]]></summary>

That's because its release is set for sometime this year, and given there are only two months left in 2022, it sounds like we won't have to wait too long to check it out. 
Outer Terror's inspirations are clear from the jump: pulpy horror comics and B-movie horror from the 1980s and 1990s with a dash of arcade fun thrown in for good measure. In the game, you'll choose from one of 10 survivors to control, each with their own unique weapons and skills, to face off against waves of enemies. You can play by yourself, but you can also team up with a friend via two-player co-op.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Spry Fox, the developer of games like Cozy Grove and Alphabears, is joining Netflix games to become the company’s sixth in-house game studio. The news was announced through a blog post on the Spry Fox website, which also answers some questions about the future of the studio.
Spry Fox says the partnership will not change any of their upcoming plans, meaning that Cozy Grove 2 and their unnamed non-violent MMO will still be developed as planned. Instead, Netflix will provide them with financial support, which Spry Fox says will allow them to “stop stressing” about how their games will generate profit. Despite all of Netflix’s current games existing through their mobile app, the blog post does not mention anything about platform exclusivity.
Spry Fox joins five other in-house game developers at Netflix: Next Games (Stranger Things: Puzzle Tales), Night School Studio (Oxenfree), Boss Fight Entertainment (Dungeon Boss), and two internal studios in Helsinki, Finland and southern California.
Netflix launched its games collection just over a year ago, in November of 2021. Currently, subscribers can play over 30 games on their mobile app, including Into the Breach, Spiritfarer, and Poinpy. On top of that, Netflix has over 50 more games in development. Have you had a chance to play any games on the Netflix app? Let us know in the comments.]]></summary>

The site's userbase is growing rapidly, in part helped by TikTok users' viral videos. Following a recent complaint from the Authors Guild, TikTok has banned the hashtag  #zlibrary pending further review. But will that help?

        <updated>2022-10-31T16:42:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Electronic Arts' Motive Studios announced its Iron Man game in September, we learned it would be the first of a multi-game deal between the publisher and Marvel. That was a vaguely defined arrangement at the time, but we now know the partnership will produce a minimum of three titles.
EA announced the news in a press release, with the publisher describing it as a “long-term” deal that could extend beyond three games based on the wording. The release also specifies these titles will be action-adventure games for consoles and PC, each featuring original stories in the Marvel universe. 
It's worth clarifying that EA is not getting exclusive rights to Marvel like it had with Star Wars. There are multiple Marvel games in the works at various studios, including the recently announced Captain America/Black Panther game from Amy Hennig’s Skydance New Media. 
“We have been long-time fans of Marvel and their impressive leadership, so this is a remarkable moment for our developers as well as our players and fans,” said EA COO Laura Miele. “We look forward to welcoming Marvel into the EA family of creators and know this collaboration will produce exceptional experiences for our players. We can’t wait to see players' reactions when they suit up as Iron Man and do the extraordinary things this Super Hero is known for.”
We’re curious to learn what other Marvel projects are on the docket and which EA studios are behind them. Motive’s Iron Man, a single-player third-person action game, is currently in pre-production, so it’s a long way from release (the team is also making the Dead Space remake). What heroes would you like to see EA tackle, and which studio do you want to see bring them to life? Let us know in the comments.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Remember Mewgenics? The wacky cat-breeding roguelike is the brainchild of Super Meat Boy co-creator and The Binding of Isaac mastermind Edmund McMillen and has been in and out of the works for a decade. After being announced, put on hold, and restarted, it appears to have a new release window. 
McMillen tweeted a gif of two of the game’s adorable cats engaging in what we'll call an intimate cat exercise. The tweet links to the game’s Steam page, which lists a 2024 release window.
Hold on to your Butts!https://t.co/wDBOizNXGl pic.twitter.com/MESXJFFXsh
October 28, 2022
What the heck is Mewgenics? The game tasks players with collecting and breeding hundreds of cats to train and send into battle. Or, as the Steam description puts it, Mewgenics is a “turn-based legacy roguelike draft sim about cats!” The game apparently boasts “100s of hours” of gameplay, multiple classes with over 50 unique abilities, over 200 enemies, and other features. 
Mewgenics was first announced in 2012, with McMillen at the time describing it as "By far the strangest project I've ever worked on.” McMillen has worked on it alongside Tyler Glaiel; the pair previously partnered for The End is Nigh, among other titles. The game was originally billed as a cross between Pokémon, The Sims, and Animal Crossing, and had first been planned to release in 2014. It was, of course, delayed, and its development was put on indefinite hold in 2016 when McMillen began work on The Legend of Bum-Bo, which launched in 2019. At the time, McMillen was unsure of Mewgenics’ future, but in 2018 he announced he was remaking the game to be released in “a few years.” 
The game is slated to launch for PC, though whether or not it’s still coming to iOS is unknown. Are you still interested in Mewgenics? Let us know in the comments! For more on Edmund McMillen, we spoke with him last December where he discussed his life and career, including Mewgenics, which you can read in this interview feature.]]></summary>

Silver Tempest stars Alolan Vulpix on the key art, but monsters like Lugia, Serperior, Ho-Oh, and Mawile share the spotlight. Meanwhile, players can expect cards starring Regieleki and Regidrago.
The Pokémon Company sent us several booster packs so we could open them and see what we pull. While it may just be dumb luck, I feel like this expansion gave me better pulls than any others in recent memory. As I cracked these open, I was met with several attractive full-art cards, as well as some gorgeous Trainer Gallery cards. I even managed to pull two of the three new Radiant Pokémon cards. 
This expansion adds over 190 cards to the ever-growing library of Pokémon cards. That number includes 6 Pokémon VSTAR cards, 15 Pokémon V cards, 1 Pokémon VMAX card, 30 special art Trainer Gallery cards, and more than 15 Trainer cards. You can see my favorite pulls from this expansion below.
