Following on from Sonic's birthday celebrations, Netflix is now gearing up for the launch of the second season of Sonic Prime on 13th July.
Ahead of its release, it's actually gone and made the first episode of season 2 available on YouTube. It did something similar with the first episode of the original season. Here's a brief description:

Atari has announced a new partnership with Playmaji Inc, the creators of the Polymega console platform. The strategy of this partnership is to create hardware and software integration between the Polymega and the Atari VCS. According to the press release, “the Atari VCS will add support for the Polymega App and the Polymega Remix add-on. This will effectively provide all of the functionality of a Polymega console to Atari VCS owners.”
As someone heavily invested in retro games, it surprises me that I haven’t heard of the Polymega. It’s a modular console that supports all manner of retro consoles. The base unit has disc support for the PS1, Sega Saturn, Sega CD, TurboGrafx-CD, and NEOGEO CD. However, there are modules that allow you to play cartridge games fo…]]></summary>

8BitDo, the purveyor of fine third-party controllers, has revealed the design for their next controller. This one is more than just a slight nod to the Neo Geo CD’s legendary mash-up between arcade stick and joypad.
By “more than just a slight nod,” I mean it’s pretty much exact. In fact, the company themselves say it is “a perfect recreation of the original SNK NEOGEO controller.” That’s sort of inaccurate since they added shoulder and extra function buttons, but I think they’re referring more to the design of the stick. NEOGEO gamepads had a special digital stick that had a unique “click” to it as you hit all the directional inputs. This was first used with the NEOGEO CD console, but the click wheel would also make its way to the NEOGEO pocket.

I consider myself a pretty big fan of action-RPG games. Therefore, like many others, I have been cautiously optimistic about the longevity Diablo 4 can provide with its content releases. And right now, Season 1 of Diablo 4 has the potential to bring ARPG fans together, or drive them even further apart.
When D4 finally got announced, it didn't take long to start hearing two claims from ARPG fans. It was common to hear either "Diablo 4 will kill Path of Exile!" or "Diablo 4 won't have good enough content to compete with Path of Exile!". With over 100 hours in D4 so far, and almost 1,500 hours in PoE over the years, let me tell you: the two games can certainly co-exist in the ARPG genre. While both games are ARPGs, their end-game systems—and there…]]></summary>

By 2004, the Gamecube was running out of steam. Nintendo had come out swinging with their new console, but their fists had hit very little meat. A number of certifiable classics beloved to this day came out in its first few years, but the console still managed to lose further ground to its competitors. Still, that year we got some memorable titles like Metroid Prime 2: Echoes, Pikmin 2, and Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door.
Of those games I just named, I only love one of them, and it’s not the one we’re talking about.

A long time ago, Metal Gear Solid 2: Substance featured a minigame where we could use the Big Shell as a skate park. Yes, you weren't dreaming that up. It was glorious, but we would rarely see similar fever dreams like that again — up until very recently.
A gameplay clip titled Dark Souls Pro Skater has emerged online, and it's exactly what you'd expect. Naturally, people are raving over how rad it looks.
https://twitter.com/SavinTheBees/status/1676019593918451712?s=20
Skate or Prepare to Die
The clip shows fan-favorite Solaire of Astora showing off his high skating stats as he performs all sorts of sick tricks in a skate park-ified version of Firelink Shrine. You don't need me to tell you which 1997 ska-punk track accompanies the footage.
The good news is that Dark Souls Pro Skater isn't some pre-alpha mod someone just began in their garage. It's a combination of Tony Hawk's Underground 2 mods that anyone can get for free. If you want to try this out, acquire a copy of THUG 2 and install the THUGPro mod. Then you can get the Firelink Skate park here, and Solaire's skin here. THUGPro is a whole world, so dive into its content and find other cool stuff that you'll like.
Maybe the positive response to this clip will inspire some clever map designers out there to turn areas such as Anor Londo into skate parks as well. Like, who knows if even the widely despised Lost Izalith area could find new life and even some love as a skating ground?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooP2_Vd8dk4
If you love Souls games but skateboarding isn't your thing, then perhaps consider waiting for Bloodborne Kart to come out to give it a go. Yes, that's also real and won't even require you to own the original Bloodborne.

Ninjaconor has casually dropped their DOS-adventure-inspired RPG, Sergeant Squidley: Space Cop, on PCs everywhere.
Ninjaconor says that Sergeant Squidley is inspired by text-based DOS games, and I totally see the aesthetic. It has big crunchy pixels and lots of text boxes. However, looking at all the media for it – it looks like a dating sim.
https://youtu.be/vz8yPQ_yxzo
It might be partially due to the eponymous police-thing browsing a dating site, but that’s not what I’m talking about. We’re told that there are seven days for the former traffic cop to solve the crime, and you do so by choosing how you spend your days. You can upgrade your skills, look after your core stats, and the outcome is based entirely on how you spend your time. Almost like a true dating sim. This is Tokimeki Memorial but with more crime. And probably a lot less dating.
Regardless of its classification, Sergeant Squidley: Space Cop is aiming to be an open-ended experience. Through your choices, Mr. Squidley might reconnect with his estranged son, follow his sax dreams, or maybe become a super-cop of some sort. What’s important here? Sax dreams or catching a murderer. I think the choice is obvious.
Sergeant Squidley: Space Cop is now available for PC via Steam.

It's that time again: The list of games being added to Xbox Game Pass for July has been revealed.

According to the post, the highlight for July is the return of Grand Theft Auto V. Unfortunately only the console version is being added to the pass, but it does include both Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S versions. Grand Theft Auto V is a big open-world game so it's always nice to have access to a game with so much content.

Those who recall the old days of Lionhead Studios and (going back even further) Bullfrog will know the name Peter Molyneux. Responsible for the Fable series, the veteran designer and programmer has certainly made a name for himself. Unfortunately, not always in a good way.
Typically known for overhyping his upcoming releases (not to mention his brush with NFT games), Molyneux seems to be uncharacteristically doing something un-Molyneux-like. In an interview with Game Reactor, he was asked whether he could divulge a few details about his next project, which is being developed via his company 22Cans.
Acknowledging his reputation, Peter Molyneux admits that in "days gone by," he would just begin talking extensively about upcoming projects. In sayin…]]></summary>

Prior to the June 2023 Nintendo Direct, 2023 was looking decidedly quiet for Switch. In March, the system entered its seventh year on store shelves and with sales numbers slowing, it seems that the long-rumoured appearance of new Nintendo hardware may finally be on the horizon in the next 12 months or so.
It is, after all, a natural progression. The lifecycle of successful consoles may well span a decade or more, but that doesn't preclude the launch of a successor long before the retirement of the outgoing device. Remember how long 3DS was on its 'deathbed'?

Get ready to hit the brakes on all that Red Dead Redemption 2 adventuring. If you fancy your chances at earning an honest buck in this turn of the century RPG, there's a mod you can download that lets you become a fine, upstanding worker.
Considered by many to be one of the best open-world games of all time, you may feel sad that Arthur Morgan's life of crime has come to an end. In which case, "Jobs - Expanded and Enhanced" could be just what you're looking for. Uploaded to Nexus Mods by user Shtivi, you can now experience what it's like to get a regular job in Red Dead Redemption 2.
[caption id="attachment_390274" align="aligncenter" width="640"] Image via Shtivi/Nexus Mods.[/caption]
As the name implies, you'll be able to take on a number of vocations in order to make ends meet. Such examples include being a mail man, chauffeur, or ranch hand. If you don't feel ready to give the tough life up just yet, you can take on wagon protection. This is actually an updated version of a previous mod, originally made by user Bolmin. Additionally, this recent upload claims to be a complete makeover, which includes "new mechanics and new jobs."
It's not always about the rootin' 'n' tootin'
With such stunning beauty and character development, the second installment in Rockstar's Red Dead Redemption series is often held aloft as an example of great game design. It's worth diving into this Wild West adventure again, for the vistas alone if nothing else.
Rockstar is no longer supporting it, but at least the developer can dedicate more time to GTA 6, whenever that's coming. We can't tell if Red Dead Redemption 2 will recieve a followup at this stage. But at the very least, PC users have a metric ton of mods to keep the game going.

Inside each bottle — which varies from a little ship in a bottle to a lightbulb — you'll see Pikmin, creatures, and even Olimar, acting out different scenes that you might carry out in any one of the Pikmin games.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On the day of our interview, Exo Rally Championship programmer and composer Rhys Lindsay was preparing for a race on a hostile alien planet, and feeling pretty good about his chances. He spent a full three minutes surveying the pockmarked, potentially lethal landscape from above with a drone, marking the most dangerous terrain in advance and picking out a relatively safe route between the checkpoints. “Alright,” he thought. “I’m going to smash this stage.”


Of course, it’s just as they say: no plan survives contact with unroaded planets wracked by extreme temperatures, meteor showers and atmospheric pressure unlike anything ever experienced on Earth. On the corner of the first checkpoint, Lindsay flipped his rover, snagging the vehicle on a rock that immediately broke his scanning systems and left him driving blind. By the time of our chat, though, he’s laughing. Exo Rally Championship is a racer for those who like to roll with the punches, quite literally - an anecdote generator for players who adore the challenge of preparing for the worst, and then adapting to changing circumstances on the fly.

The findings consist of dozens of boxes filled with video tapes. Why tapes? Because the internet was very slow back in the day. Even in the early '00s, most video game reporting took place on TV, and only a select number of big tech and gaming websites ever got to do such coverage. Thus, most of the good stuff like trailers, gameplay captures, and interviews showed up on TV once and then disappeared forever. The few things t…]]></summary>

If you're simply itching for the latest edition of EA's FIFA franchise, then... well, you're not going to get it. Yes, as previously revealed, the FIFA franchise is no more and will effectively be replaced by EA Sports FC (at least until FIFA finds an alternative developer/publisher).
Still, it's likely that EA Sports FC 24 will be very much "more of the same" from EA, albeit without the FIFA license or branding. It's even aiming for a similar release date to past entries; at least according to known leaker billbil-kun (thanks, VGC). The football title will reportedly launch on September 29th, 2023. For comparison, FIFA 23 launched on September 27th, 2022.

The Garbage Pail Kids are a bit out of my wheelhouse. I don’t particularly like gross-out humor. Even some of the stuff in Ren & Stimpy is too much for me. I respect gross-out humor. I think it’s probably healthy to find amusement in bodily functions that we all experience but, for some reason, choose to demonize. That doesn’t change things, though. It doesn’t tickle the atrophied humor muscle in my brain.
Except for butts. Butts are forever funny.
However, the NES is part of my domain. So when Garbage Pail Kids: Mad Mike and the Quest for Stale Gum arrived, I couldn’t turn down the opportunity to pick up a physical copy of it for NES. To be clear, I bought this myself. When I covered Blazing Rangers back in February, First Press Games had offered me a copy of it. I’m no…]]></summary>

For all of you who prefer your browsing ad-free, there could be trouble brewing. It turns out that YouTube does not like people using ad-blocking software on its website, and it's getting to the point where the company is looking to enforce some rule changes on that front.
In a post on Reddit, user Reddit_n_Me uploaded a screenshot of a message from YouTube warning that the "video player will be blocked after three videos." The reasons behind this, according to the message, are down to the use of an ad blocker, before insisting that ads are beneficial to YouTube and how users are free to sign up to the official Premium account if they do not wish to be exposed to advertisements while watching content.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This Friday on July 7th, Frontier Development's Warhammer RTS Age Of Sigmar: Realms Of Ruin is holding its first open beta test for its 1v1 multiplayer mode. Players will be able to go head to head with two of the game's four factions - the golden fantasy knights of the Stormcast Eternals and the sneaky green stink lads of the Orruk Kruleboyz - giving us our first taste of how they'll handle in battle, and the kinds of powerplays we'll be making with their respective (and rather handsome) tabletop miniature recreations. 
And having played four rounds of its 1v1 matches already at a press event last week, it's quite the thrill - and I say that as someone with no real attachment to Warhammer or Age Of Sigmar's specific lore legacy. The Stormcast Eternals and their flying hammer brutes are just as devastating as you'd imagine, while the lads lads lads and their Killaboss Kruleboyz are challenging late-game bloomers that will give even hardened strategy game veterans plenty to sink their teeth into. Both factions are great fun, and I'm very much looking forward to jumping back in this weekend.

Since the release of Tears of the Kingdom, fans have been pushing the game and its mechanics to its limits. In the process, a few glitches have been unearthed that make it easy to get rich or create absurdly powerful weapons. Nintendo has been on top of these tricks, and with new every patch glitches have been eliminated.
The latest patch for Tears of the Kingdom (v.1.2.0) fixes a few minor issues with the game, but it also removes a couple of get-rich-quick glitches. Players hoping still hoping to beat the system will have to either avoid updating their game or find a new way to farm Rupees fast.

We all remember the start-up animations from the Wii home menu, right? You'd select a game, see the icon fill the screen and then watch a short animation (accompanied by music, of course) while you chose whether to start the title or head back to the home page. We miss them.
For many of us, these menu animations are deeply ingrained in our heads for the likes of Smash Bros. Brawl, Skyward Sword and Super Mario Galaxy, but what would things be like if some of the Switch's finest titles got the same treatment? That is the very question that YouTube channel Pineapple Puppy has attempted to answer, as they built Wii-style menu animations for a whole bunch of Switch games and now we're feeling all kinds of nostalgic.

Crime O’Clock is a stylish-looking, screen-searching detective game that was featured in Nintendo’s Indie World Showcase back in April. The latest game from Milan-based development team Bad Seed, it promises to blend time travel with crime solving across large, densely populated hand-drawn maps.
A hidden object game with a temporal twist, Crime O’Clock ties its find-the-item tasks together with a convoluted story of AIs, timelines, and criminal acts. A typical stage starts by presenting a lovingly drawn monochrome cartoon scene and asking the player to find the site of a crime by zooming and panning. The evidence sought is imaginative, sometimes amusingly absurd, ranging from broken crockery to hapless anthropomorphic individuals squashed to death under fallen rubble. Having located the critical place, the hunt is on for clues as to what went down.

The listing accounts for five of Nintendo's top earners, with president Shuntaro Furukawa at the top (as you might expect) followed by Shigeru Miyamoto, Shinya Takahashi, Satoru Shibata and Ko Shiota. Following the success of the Switch and developments in Nintendo's movie and theme park reach, you might expect these directors to be taking home unfathomably huge salaries, but the reality is quite different.

A few weeks ago, Seth Sturgill, a podcast acquaintance of mine, put out some feelers on Twitter for games to cover on his Keep Nintendo Weird podcast. I’ve been on the show twice before, talking about Pocket Card Jockey and Part Time UFO. If you know anything about me, you know I hold both those games close to my heart. So I was happy to give them just a little bit more coverage on his podcast, even if I stumbled over my words more than Joe Biden stumbles up the stairs. With Seth’s latest call for titles to talk about, there was only one that came to mind. It’s this weird Nintendo exclusive designed by Martin Hollis, arguably best known for his work with Rare on Killer Instinct, Perfect Dark, and GoldenEye 007. Those games are a far cry from the one…]]></summary>

We are just a few weeks away from the release of Pikmin 4, which is set to add two brand-new types of our leaf-headed companions into the Pik 'n' mix. Ice and Glow Pikmin will be joining the lineup of seven other mainline types on 21st July, so we thought that now would be the perfect time to take a look back and rank all of those that we have seen so far to establish who is likely to make it into our squad.
While you do get to take the newly-added Ice Pikmin for a spin in the Pikmin 4 demo, we have decided to leave them off the following list for now since we can't say that we have been able to see their full capabilities just yet. Who knows what icy challenges await... or not.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Thrilling as it may be to swing a lightsaber or shoot a headcrab in stereoscopic 3D, the VR experiences I crave most are those which use the tech to fold my brain into entirely new shapes. 2019's A Fisherman's Tale was one of those. An unassuming first-person puzzler about a puppet fisherman living in a lighthouse, it dazzled with its incredible deployment of VR's unique sense of perspective and scale. It's the kind of game that, if it featured a psychotic AI and some cake memes instead of a beard in a yellow anorak, would have been heralded as a revolution in play.


It would have been easy to follow-up A Fisherman's Tale in the same way, make a bigger game with a few new gimmicks and a comedy lobster voiced by Stephen Merchant. But that isn't what developer InnerspaceVR has done. Instead, Another Fisherman's Tale bends your neural pathways in entirely new forms, offering a completely different kind of puzzling. The results are equally innovative and almost as interactively satisfying - although a lack of refinement in the latter category is a deflating puncture in the game's dinghy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Chugging along
Altfuture has dropped the biggest update yet for their train simulator, Derail Valley. It's been a while since the last update, but considering the size of this one, it's reason for celebration. It's titled Derail Valley: Simulator. That sounds horrifying.
Remember Derail Valley? I've heard of it, but it’s hard to pick something out among the many train simulators on PC. It started out as a very VR-focused title before offering non-VR options. It's been an Early Access title for a while now. Overhauled was its last big update in 2020, while Simulator is the next step in its evolution as it makes its way to meeting Altfuture's vision for it.
https://youtu.be/Htm2HD91Lmk
Why should you pay attention? Derail Valley isn’t just a train simulator. Whereas your typical train sim will cast you as the train itself, Derail Valley has you play as a person driving a train. So, you can get in and out, which is necessary to actually do tasks outside the locomotive itself. There’s a lot of tactile gameplay mixed in, possibly as a result of its original VR focus.
The Simulator update brings with it a complete redo of the UI, mouse cursor driving, new camera angles, a sandbox mode, more trains, steam simulation, weather effects, and… Just, a lot. Here are the patch notes to get a better idea.
Now I just need to know if I can play it with my Densha De Go 64 controller.
Derail Valley is currently in Steam Early Access for PC. The Simulator update is available now.

Fortnite has shown that it will collaborate with just about any major IP. From Marvel to DC, to even Dragon Ball, Fortnite has become the Who's Who? Of Battle Royales. Their latest IP they've managed to snag is none other than Transformers, and they're making sure they can get in on the fun.
The Fortnite Battle Bus gets the Autobots Treatment in Latest Physical Pack
Fortnite's Latest Physical Pack, which includes three new skins, three new back blings, 1,000 v-bucks, two emotes, and three new pickaxes is coming soon. Entitled the "Transformers Pack" this bundle will cost about $25 USD without taxes, and includes Bumblebee, Megatron, and a new Transformer based on the Fortnite Battle Bus.

Bumblebee comes with a back bling based on his car-door wings, as well as a Stinger Sword Pickaxe. The pickaxe also comes with a built-in "Battle Ready" emote.

Megatron's portion of the pack comes with a Decepticon logo back bling, and the Energon Mace Pickaxe. The built-in emote for this Pickaxe turns it into his iconic Fusion Cannon.

Last, but not least, Fortnite's own battle bus becomes a Transformer as well, complete with the "Bot Air Balloon" back bling, and the Pick Axle Pickaxe.
The physical pack will be sold in retail stores on October 13th, with digital versions of the pack being available on October 21st. There's still time to work through Chapter 4: Season 3's battle pass, to complete the Transformers collection with Optimus Prime before he leaves at the end of the season!

In his latest video in the 'Game Concepts' series, Masahiro Sakurai once again goes back to Kid Icarus: Uprising. This time, the legendary game designer breaks down the game's "unique" control scheme and explains the difficulties that the team had in developing the title.
Part on-rails shooter, part third-person shooter, Uprising has a slightly unusual control scheme that even Sakurai notes "takes some getting used to" — moving Pit with the Circle Pad and using the touchscreen to change the camera angle and aim attacks wasn't the easiest to grasp, we'll admit. Over the years, we wondered why a title such as this didn't make the most of Nintendo's Circle Pad Pro — the 3DS accessory that connected to the handheld to add an extra circle pad and shoulder buttons — to implement true twin-stick controls, but it turns out that there was a very simple answer: space.

Atlus describe her as a “mysterious revolutionary with a strong sense of justice,” although it’s not yet clear what we’re revolting against, aside from vaguely-French demons. Check out the new gameplay trailer.

Yesterday, the action-platformer sequel dropped a trailer showing off a lush jungle level that's strikingly similar to the original game’s opening environment, but this time things have been high-qualified with pretty sun rays, explosions, and dodge rolls aplenty.

The Steam hardware survey is a chance for both Valve and the general public to see exactly what PC gamers are playing at that particular time. It can reveal some pretty interesting results. For example, in the latest survey, it looks like Nvidia and AMD's new generation of graphical hardware are barely getting a look in.
You can check out June's results over on Steam (via PC Gamer). The GPU section in particular is intriguing, showing that over 90% of gamers are using DirectX 12 hardware. However, if you were curious to see where Nvidia's RTX 4000 series or AMD's RX 7000 cards are, you'd think no one was buying any of them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Flock is the next game from the makers of Wilmot's Warehouse, Hohokum and I Am Dead, but ever since it was announced last year, I've been wondering about exactly what kind of game it is. The first trailer revealed lots of strange, whimsical environments, equally whimsical-looking beasties and a little person flying around on the back of a giant bird herding them around in delightful swoops and swirls. We also saw some sheep grazing in a meadow before they, too, started to fly alongside your wilder, more abstract animal pals. But the question of what you do in Flock remained unanswered - until last week, when developers Hollow Ponds showed us a little bit more of their creature collecting game during the Annapurna Interactive Showcase stream.
There, they revealed that we'll need to collect and charm these creatures to get them to join our respective flocks, and that we'll be able to do so in co-op with a pal. It looks intensely charming, but it still left me with lots of unanswered questions. So I spoke to devs Ricky Haggett and Richard Hogg to find out more. Naturally, there are some things they're not ready to reveal about Flock just yet, but they did tell me that you'll start on top of a mountain and will be wending your way down it with your flock of sheep.

The Legend of Zelda series has a lot of funky titles — Twilight Princess, A Link Between Worlds, The Wind Waker, and the list goes on, filled with names that just sound cool. But perhaps the coolest of the bunch is Majora's Mask. It's so full of mystery. What does it mean? Where did it come from?
For a good few years now, we believed that the title (at least, the Japanese "Mujura's Mask" one) was born out of a mash-up between the surname of the game's art director, Takaya Imamura, and the 1995 Robin Williams movie Jumanji. That was the story according to series producer Eiji Aonuma, but it turns out that Imamura remembers things slightly differently (thanks, VGC).

Studios and publishers would generally agree that video games having their source code leaked is a pretty bad thing. But what if it's an old game that people probably aren't buying these days anyway? That's the case for the original Far Cry from 2004, whose source code cropped up online recently.
The story emerged after Twitter user and Duke Nukem modder Vinícius Medeiros posted a bunch of screenshots showing the complete code for the first Far Cry game. When asked by another user, a link to archive.org was then posted, leading to a download page for anyone interested in checking it out. The files were uploaded by user Llaetha.ro in June and are said to be 1.34 version of the game.

The detective genre has evolved a great deal since its point-and-click adventure game roots, and this list proves how much things have changed. In fact, the games that we're including in this list range from typical noir detective fare to the kinds of games that you'll probably tell us "don't count as detective games" in the comments!

The main thing marking it out, apart from its style, is that instead of stabbing monsters, you attack by hovering the cursor (actually the shimmery face of the sword's spirit) over them and clicking, which launches your little globby shadow man directly at them. You can probably already imagine that this is also a means of getting around the world.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[He is "not involved in the remake".
Arguably the biggest surprise at the most recent Nintendo Direct was the announcement of Super Mario RPG for the Switch. It's a remake of Square's 1996 RPG with updated 3D graphics and cinematics.
As excited as fans were, one other person who was equally as surprised by this announcement was Chihiro Fujioka - one of the original directors of this classic. In a brief exchange with a fan on social media, Fujioka revealed he wasn't involved in this updated version, adding he was "very surprised" but also incredibly "pleased" by the announcement.

I’m not looking to start a fight here. When The Genji and the Heike Clans was released in Japanese arcades by Namco in 1986 as Genpei Tōma Den, it was generally well-respected. However, here at the Destructoid Institute of Critiquing Kusoge (DICK), we have a saying: If it walks like Kusoge, quacks like Kusoge, and smells like Kusoge, it’s definitely Kusoge (crap game). So, are you going to take the word of Japan, the experts on Kusoge? Or would you rather be daring and listen to the brash, upstart DICK?
I don’t know why I’m so hesitant to talk about The Genji and the Heike Clans with the perspective of it being a bad game. If someone trots in with Altered Beast, I’d be the first one to stand up and tell them how much it sucks. It’s perhaps because, culturally, I understand Altere…]]></summary>

There's something enamoring about the 1998 Game Boy Camera. Sure, it wasn't a photographer's best friend, but its all-in-one camera and software made it a delightful piece of tech from Nintendo. It turned a handheld game console into a digital camera for budding photographers.
Even 25 years later, the Game Boy Camera is still being celebrated. But few support the quirky device more than Christopher Graves, who recently reworked the entire thing to fit into a (basically) standard-size Game Boy cartridge. This is the Game Boy Mini Camera.

“The head was vacuum-formed, but Yoshi’s whole body was solid foam,” adds Kathy Lawrence, the costume designer responsible for creating the mascots for dozens of Nintendo’s TV spots in the ʼ90s and 2000s.
“It went from a costume that weighed about 35 pounds to over 200 pounds,” Fireball says. “The foam, like a sponge, just absorbed the water, and I just started to sink.” Mistaking his outreached hand for a thumbs up, Kathy and the crew were excited as they watched her husband fight for his life underwater.

I futilely try to circulate air in my sweat-stained shirt at an intersection surrounded by questionable bars and seedy nightclubs. A comparatively innocent landmark grabs my attention: a batting center. It’s a delightfully familiar sight. But as I imagine its visitors enjoying a fun day swinging for the fences, author Jake Adelstein pops my thought bubble by telling me that the most horrific gang violence he ever witnessed unfolded on the corner we stand on: someone cracking another person’s skull open with a baseball bat.

In a post on their community website, Studio Wildcard revealed that the upcoming remaster of ARK: Survival Evolved has been delayed until October. Officially titled ARK: Survival Ascended, the remastered version utilizes Unreal Engine 5.2 and offers full cross-platform support.
Delays are nothing new to ARK fans, with the highly anticipated sequel ARK II getting delayed as well just a few months ago.
As disappointing as a delay can be, there is some good news. ARK: Survival Ascended has received a discount on its launch price. The open world survival game will now launch in Early Access at the price point of $44.99. A $5 launch discount will bring the price to $39.99.

Even though the retro-inspired first-person shooter sub-genre has been running at full steam for a while, I feel like it just keeps getting better. Sure, I feel like a lot of it is mowing down demons or cultists to heavy metal music, and it can sometimes be hard to tell your Hyperviolent apart from your Turbo Overkill, but still new approaches pop up that are easy to miss.
Slayers X: Terminal Aftermath: Vengance of the Slayer is one of my favorite releases this year. It combines the weird aesthetic of the late-’90s FPS era with extremely effective character exploration. It stands out from the crowd, even if its gameplay is almost deliberately hobbled to evoke the feeling of an amateur mod.

It certainly isn't a "Silent Night" while playing Ebenezer and the Invisible World. Instead of three French hens and four calling birds, your relatives will hear a ruckus as you scream at the game. There's a lot to like, but the combat needs to be refined before this Metroidvania's release. The visuals call back to those old Christmas specials you watch as a kid, but other than that, there's a lot to be fixed in this holiday-themed game. Here's a preview of the stunning, yet currently flawed Ebenezer and the Invisible World.

It's become a tired joke these days to make fun of Valve for never making a "threequel." But it's hard to get away from such a meme when the topic keeps cropping up, as is the case for Left 4 Dead 3. Back in March, there were leaks saying that a third entry in the zombie co-op FPS could be in the pipeline. However, that's unlikely to be the case, based on what former Valve writer Chet Faliszek said recently.
While he didn't actually say that a new Left 4 Dead game would never come to fruition (though that's ultimately not his decision), the leaks that got everyone excited are probably nothing to get too worked up about. According to Faliszek, who was speaking on the VŌC Podcast this past weekend, these leaked bits and bobs were most likely assets…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If Ubisoft's summer showcase was any indication, it's going all-in on Assassin's Creed. But a recent report from Kotaku suggests that the company's commitment to the franchise might be going even deeper than we thought; Ubisoft has recently begun the process of remaking Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag. 
The remake is currently in "its earliest stages," Kotaku reports, so details are scarce, and we won't be seeing it officially for a few years. A team at Ubisoft Singapore, a branch that has contributed to almost every mainline Assassin's Creed game, is said to be heavily involved. Most notably, Ubisoft Singapore worked on the creation of naval combat for Assassin's Creed III and IV, a success that would place it at the head of development for Ubisoft's naval-focused game, Skull and Bones. Of course, Skull and Bones is now notorious for its years of repeated delays – fans of Black Flag will just have to hope the seas will be calmer for the studio's next project.


Black Flag was released in 2013 on the eve of a new console generation, coming to PS3 and 360, but also to PS4, Xbox One, and Wii U. The game follows Edward Kenway – the pirate grandfather of the protagonist Connor from Assassin's Creed III – as he plunders the Caribbean and stumbles into the Assassin Brotherhood. Combining the series' classic stealth gameplay with naval exploration and combat, it's widely regarded as one of the franchise's best entries. Check out our review here.

Photo mode has pretty much become a standard feature in modern gaming. Everything from Disco Elysium to God of War: Ragnarok to Final Fantasy XVI have it available.

Now it's Skyrim's turn, thanks to modder powerofthree over on Nexus Mods (via PCGamesN). As the name suggests, this custom modification allows you to take snapshots of this icy slice of Tamriel. It also comes with a host of settings for the in-game camera, such as the ability to slow down time, adjust the FOV, and add a few filters.

The first game to publicly use it was Resident Evil 7: Biohazard, which caused many to dub the engine the Resident Evil engine, which is not what the ‘RE’ stands for. Instead, the acronym is confusingly shorthand for Reach for the Moon. In Japan, the Resident Evil series is called Biohazard, which is why Exoprimal technical director Kazuki Abe is surprised that anyone ever thought the engine was named after the survivor horror series . “It’s really just a matter of coincidence that Resident Evil games are also developed using this engine.”
Since Resident Evil 7, RE Engine has been used to develop Resident Evil Village, the Resident E…]]></summary>

Brawls take place in a 3D arena, and happily look to be channeling some chaos from the Naruto Shippuden and Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi games. Take a look at the game below.

You get my point. The future, but via a second-hand retro clothes store full of dungarees and big print. I'd hesitate to say Return To Grace, a gentle adventure about exploring an ancient complex that houses a long-dormant god-like AI, entirely meets the strict definition of "retrofuturist", but it's definitely "space but the 60s", and it looks bloody lovely.

Activision has implemented a "Mitigation" called "Hallucination" in Call Of Duty. "Mitigation" is the tacticool name that Team Ricochet, COD's anti-cheating department, gives to measures that identify and reduce cheating. Hallucination spawns imaginary enemies in the field of view of cheaters. These keep them busy while innocent players get to shoot each other up.
Regarding Hallucination's decoys, Ricochet says they “are undetectable by legitimate players, and they cannot impact a legitimate player’s aim, progression, end of match stats or overall gameplay experience, but serve to disorient cheaters in a variety of ways”.
If you're a cheater, the decoys will act just like real players and also look like real players in the cheater's software of…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[[Insert cat pun here]
Let your mind wander back to summer 2022. This period saw the release of a new Xenoblade Chronicles after five years of waiting. The anticipated reboot of Saints Row was a huge let-down for many. But among all these was BlueTwelve Studio's Stray, a dystopian-looking adventure game that lets you control a cat lost in the city.
It was very well-received (in fact, we nominated it for Best PlayStation Game of 2022, putting it up against such titans as Elden Ring and God of War: Ragnarok), so you Xbox owners might be interested to know that Stray is coming to Series X/S on August 10. This information was revealed at the recent showcase for Annapurna Interactive, the publisher behind the game.
https://twitter.com/Xbox/status/1674559605471412225
While we were pretty certain that Stray would be coming to Xbox, it's nice that it's finally been confirmed. What's interesting about this announcement is that it's also coming to Xbox One, so if you're still on previous-gen consoles, you're in luck.
Curiosity...did something to the cat
In an era of remasters, remakes, reboots, sequels, and prequels, the likes of Stray provide something a little different. I mean, who among us wouldn't want the chance to take control of a cat on an exciting (if somewhat gritty) adventure?
When it launched last year, it was available on PC and PlayStation, so a lot of you Xbox users out there were probably hoping you'd get to play it at some point. The fact that the game hasn't been in the public eye much this year (if at all) means that this Xbox announcement could renew interest across the board.
So, just to reiterate: Stray will be available on the Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One this August 10.

Apparently 10 years is the answer, since a remake of Assassin’s Creed 4: Black Flag (aka the best one) is reportedly in the early stages of development at Ubisoft, at least a0ccording to a report from Kotaku. If true, this means it's joining The Last Of Us Part 1 as 2013’s other maybe-too-soon remake.

The post includes a message from Valve saying that developers "own the rights to all of the IP used in the data set that trained the AI to create assets." Valve have now cleared up their thought process on the subject, saying they don’t want to discourage developers from experimenting with AI tech, though they need to make sure developers have “sufficient rights” before publishing anything on Steam.

I've thoroughly enjoyed making the team play a tough puzzle game, especially one that's intentionally retro and a bit spooky without being scary. So why not come and join in the discussion? Haha, that's a joke: you don't have a choice. As I said, you're locked in here unless you can find the Resident Evil-ass key I have hidden in here somewhere.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here's a move I pull in most gunfights in Trepang2: slidekick into an enemy, grab them out of mid-air, briefly hold them in front of me as a human shield, only to pull the pin on their vest's grenade and hurl them into a group of their pals, who do try to scatter before this meaty bomb bursts but sadly forget that they also need to avoid me and my shotgun. Often this is all in slow-motion. Trepang2 is unashamedly aiming to be a new F.E.A.R. and does a pretty great job of it for a game made by a core team of only four people (plus external artists and such). Give me a shotgun, a slidekick, and slo-mo, and I'm happy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Super Replay returns, and we're checking out Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts! Join us today on Twitch at 2:00 p.m. Central as we kick of the adventure, which will continue each week until we roll credits. We'll also have every episode available the next day on our Game Informer Shows YouTube Channel (or you can watch the videos in the above playlist). 
Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts was released for the Xbox 360 on November 11, 2008. The third (and, so far, final) entry in Rare's beloved platforming series centers on vehicle creation, where players collect and slap together hundreds of parts to assemble their own wacky contraptions to explore. The bevy of possible combinations and emphasis on player choice and creativity was largely unprecedented at the time, paving the way for future games such as the upcoming The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. However, this direction would divide fans due to how much it strays from the traditional Banjo formula. So where will I land on it? Let's find out.
Join me, Marcus Stewart, alongside Kyle Hilliard as we explore one of the Xbox 360's biggest hidden gems to see whether it holds up or falls apart like a poorly constructed doohickey.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Scorn was one of the most enigmatic and polarizing games when it crept to Xbox and PC last fall. Some love it, some despise it, and PlayStation fans will get to see which side of the fence they fall on when it hits PlayStation 5 this fall.
Despite appearing like a shooter on its surface, Scorn is an atmospheric puzzle-focused experience. As a strange humanoid creature, you’ll explore a labyrinthian H.R. Giger-inspired alien world to unravel its mysteries. While combat is present, it’s very much secondary to deciphering the abstract story and riddles, and even those revelations will primarily be up to your interpretation. 
The PlayStation 5 version features DualSense haptic feedback support and 4K/60 fps gameplay. Check out the game’s new trailer below.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alright, sure, so we technically assassinated your leader, and detonated a populated planet, and wiped out the first clan we ever met. But that was all self defence and we're not here to cause trouble. We just... have a lot going on okay.
The Pegasus Expedition is one of my favourite kinds of game. I'm not sure if it quite comes together enough, but it's trying something so original that even its partial success is worth celebrating. You're leading a 4X-ish effort to establish a power base in an unfamiliar galaxy. But you're not doing it to conquer everyone or win victory points. You're doing it so you can go back home and save Earth from annihilation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good immersive sims are hard to beat. Almost nothing matches the feeling of creatively using all of your abilities to find a scrappy and sometimes unintentionally hilarious solution. Enter Mosa Lina, a pixel platformer that calls itself a “hostile interpretation of the immersive sim, where nothing is planned, and everything works.” Unpredictability is what the game prides itself on and “hostile” is definitely not an understatement based on the embedded developer tweet below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ruinarch is based on a concept many of you have thought of at some point. What if, instead of building up villages and hunting down hostile monsters and evil overlords, you were playing as the Dark Lord?
It's been done most famously in Dungeon Keeper or Overlord, but those were quite conventional structurally. Sure, you were playing as the baddies, but still doing mostly the same things as in other games, twirling your moustache the whole time. Ruinarch feels not like one of those thematic remixes of an established structure, but an attempt to build a new subgenre. Now that it's reached a full release, it also, sadly, feels like a demonstration of how difficult that really is.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I only had four TV channels growing up, and thus do not knowing anything about Bob L'éponge other than what is required to understand Tumblr posts (and that he lives in a tropical fruit). What I can tell you is that the SpongeBob Squarepants DLC for PowerWash Simulator confirms that PowerWash DLC is now the only way I will consume content about pop culture I do not understand. The most elaborate Spiderverse-themed skins for Fortnite, with all the custom dances they can muster, are as shadows and dust next to methodically cleaning an orange submarine car while a fictional octopus sends you sad texts. I'm convinced PowerWash Sim could do a crossover with literally any intellectual property and make it work. Lego. Mad Men. The filmography of Nicolas Cage. Clean them all.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As some of you might be aware, I went to Japan earlier this year and had a great time. Off the back of the trip, I've finally decided to get my act together and pursue a long, arduous road to some degree of fluency. It's always going to be a work-in-progress, but I think I've settled into a language learning routine which leaves me with plenty of time for Love Island in the evening. DuoLingo's owl has been punted to the curb, too, because the bird is awful.
Naturally, I've turned to a textbook: Genki I. At first I thought there was no getting past it being a bit dry - I mean they aren't meant to be thrillers, are they? Until, that was, I discovered Game Gengo, a YouTuber who takes each lesson from the textbook, breaks them down into manageable chunks, all complete with loads of examples from video games. I spend most of my evenings with the guy, and what a treat it is.

The Xbox ANZ account tweeted an image of a noughts and crosses board that spelled out Psycho with three Xs. It was a rather confusing tease to say the least, and lo and behold, there was no Psychonauts 3 announcement during the showcase. Now Double Fine boss Tim Schafer has confirmed that he’s not working on it either.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over a decade on from its Nintendo DS release, there's still nothing quite like Ghost Trick. In this smart murder mystery detective game from the creator of Ace Attorney, you play the recently deceased amnesiac Sissel as he attempts to piece together his own demise. Who killed him? And why? And what's the deal with these newfound powers he has to turn back time and manipulate inanimate objects in his vicinity? That definitely wasn't in the ghostbusting 101 manual. Alas, he doesn't have long to find out, as he'll cross over to the afterlife in the morning. Thus begins a frantic night of whodunnit puzzling at its finest, with director Shu Takumi showing us exactly what he's made of outside the courtroom dramas he built his name on.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pokémon Go developer Niantic has announced a massive restructuring, where it will be closing its Los Angeles office, terminating over 200 employees, and scaling back development on a few titles as it narrows its focus towards supporting current titles while increasing its commitment to mixed and augmented reality development.
In an email sent to staff by CEO John Hanke (which you can read here), he explains that the pandemic-era surge of recruitment and expanding pipeline of projects ballooned to the point that, once the pandemic ended, the resulting expenses outpaced its revenue. 
“In the wake of the revenue surge we saw during Covid, we grew our headcount and related expenses in order to pursue growth more aggressively, expanding existing game teams, our AR platform work, new game projec…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tonight's Annapurna Interactive Showcase brought us 30 minutes of fresh game announcements, putting a lovely (and hopefully final) full stop on this year's notE3 / Summer Game Fest period. While most of the announcements were updates on games we already knew about, there are a couple of cool new things in there that I'm personally quite pumped for, including a new Blade Runner game being developed internally at Annapurna Interactive, a new Keita Takahashi joint about a kid stuck in a T-pose of all things, and a new ghostly biking game from the team behind Nidhogg. I'd highly recommend watching the showcase in full if you can, but in case you need a quick refresher of what happened, or are just short on time, we've rounded up every announcement in order below.

In it, we get to see exactly how its adorable creature herding works in co-op, which you'd probably hope to see, given its own Steam page also describes it as a co-op multiplayer game. But rest assured, Flock is still very much a game you can play on your own, without the need to have a pal along for the ride, the devs tell me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Annapurna Interactive, the publisher behind games like Stray and Neon White, held a showcase today to reveal new games, and updates for previously announced ones, shine the spotlight on new developers, and more. It even unveiled its first-ever first-party game. We have all that and more in our breakdown below. 
Here’s everything announced during the 2023 Annapurna Interactive Showcase
While the showcase featured plenty of updates about games we’re already excited about, it also featured four new game reveals.

        <updated>2023-06-29T19:29:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Annapurna Interactive has revealed Blade Runner 2033: Labyrinth, a new game set in the same world as the Blade Runner film series, and it's the first game developed in-house. 
Annapurna has published plenty of great games, but it announced last year that it had created a new internal studio to actually develop one. And now we know that game is Blade Runner 2033: Labyrinth. As the name suggests, it takes place in 2033, which puts it between the original film and its sequel, Blade Runner 2049. Blade Runner 2033: Labyrinth takes place in a dystopian Los Angeles like its cinematic predecessors, and the game's events occur after the Blackout hits. 
Not much else was revealed about the game, but you can check out its moody cinematic trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, this game looks very Blade Runner, and we can't wait to learn more about it. Blade Runner 2033: Labyrinth's development is led by game director Chelsea Hash, who previously served as the director of Solar Ash and technical art lead on What Remains of Edith Finch. 
Annapurna Interactive says Blade Runner 2033: Labyrinth is the first new Blade Runner game for consoles and PC in development in 25 years. It's due out sometime in the future on consoles and PC, but there's no word on when to expect it. However, Annapurna Interactive says it will share more details about the game soon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Thirsty Suitors will be released on PlayStation, Xbox (including Xbox Game Pass), Switch, and PC on November 2, it's been revealed. 
This news comes by way of today's Annapurna Interactive Showcase, where developer Outerloop Games released a new trailer showing off more of what to expect in this RPG that's one part a skateboarding game, another part a cooking game, and always a game about confronting your exes and parents. It looks great – we quite enjoyed playing it recently during Summer Game Fest 2023 – and you can check it out for yourself below in the newest Thirsty Suitors trailer: 


As you can see, players take on the role of protagonist Jala, who, after a bad breakup, returns to her hometown. There, she must confront her exes and try to reconcile with them, please her tough-to-please parents, and mend broken friendships in time for her sister's wedding. To do all that, Jala will skateboard, take part in turn-based combat seemingly inspired by Persona and Pokémon, cook meals with her parents, and more. 
Thirsty Suitors hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC via Steam on November 2.

In the game, you control a small beetle-like creature as you traverse through a mysterious alien world using strange orbs that they themselves are worlds you can dive into.

As you can see, Cocoon continues to look great and now we know we don't have to wait too much longer to play it.

Among the new additions: car crashes, much improved pathfinding, and car parks. I find all of these as exciting as each other.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the 21st century, fans of the NFL have had minimal choices when it comes to their officially licensed football games. Ever since 2004, EA Sports' annualized Madden NFL series has been the exclusive franchise for the NFL, its teams, stadiums, and players. The result was the closure of other franchises, such as the competitive NFL 2K series, as well as the arcade-focused NFL Blitz franchise (which was later acquired by EA in 2011). The recently announced Wild Card Football from Saber Interactive, part of the Playgrounds franchise, hopes to smash through the established line to give players a fresh 7-on-7 arcade-facing take on the sport starring their favorite players.

        <id>120758</id>
        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2023/06/29/baldurs-gate-3-re-rolls-initiative-advancing-pc-release-date-but-delaying-ps5"/>
        <updated>2023-06-29T15:55:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While game delays have become commonplace, the opposite is extremely rare. Today, we learned Baldur's Gate 3 is somehow doing both at the same time. Initially planned for August 31, developer Larian Studios is advancing the PC release date to August 3 while delaying the PS5 version to September 6. According to the most recent community update, the change was done to prioritize release in order of platform readiness. More specifically, the team needed a little more time to get the PS5 version up to 60 frames per second.
"The PlayStation 5 version will be released roughly a week later than its originally scheduled date of August 31st," the community update reads. "Baldur’s Gate 3 is targeting 60 frames-per-second and we’re close to achieving that on the platform but need a bit more extra time. We don’t want to compromise on quality, and feel it would be a shame to downscale to 30fps or make other compromises to hit an arbitrary date."
Meanwhile, the PC version has moved up a whopping four weeks. Larian says, "This means the PC version of Baldur’s Gate 3 will be released at a time where you’ll have more time to play it," likely in reference to the release of Starfield, Bethesda's massive upcoming open-world RPG. By releasing their game over a month earlier, it's a little less likely that gamers would have to choose one or the other to devote their time to.
The community update also casts a light cantrip on some of the features coming to the full game, including new spells, the addition of feats, the Half-Orc and Dragonborn races, the monk class, and a huge line-up of new subclasses, which you can see listed below.
For more Baldur's Gate 3, check out its Summer Game Fest trailer that revealed Jason Issacs' role in the game.]]></summary>

It's not bullying. Maybe you don't enjoy getting your comeuppance. But the alternative is still pretty funny. Onwards! This week, I ask you to pick between helping people find things in an environment and using part of the environment as a weapon. What's better: Tagging locations for teamies, or door violence?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dave The Diver has launched in full today, leaving its early access shell behind. The game is a real platter of genres, mixing flavours of RPG, management sim, visual novel and more to create a unique kind of experience that made a real splash while it was in early access. Dave's quite popular tenure in early access had three chapters to its name, but the full release takes that number up to seven alongside new weapons, areas, and features for the deep-sea-explorathon. Take a look at the new release trailer below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Disney Illusion Island is an upcoming “Mickeyvania” exclusive to Switch and after being revealed over a year ago, it’s finally out next month. Dlala Studios and Disney have released a new story trailer to prepare potential players for what’s in store on the island. 
Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Donald Duck, and Goofy mysteriously arrive on the island of Monoth and soon after find that its people need their help. This kickstarts their journey as players must platform through the various obstacles, challenges, and biomes of Monoth. Each character has the same abilities (although animated quite differently), so players can select whichever hero they want to save the day. 
Check out the latest Disney Illusion Island story trailer for yourself below: 


For more about Disney Illusion Island, watch the reveal trailer from last summer and then check out this gameplay trailer from February. After that, read about the game’s lack of combat and a Metroid-style map.
Disney Illusion Island hits Switch on July 28.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Final Fantasy XVI hit PlayStation 5 exclusively last week on June 23, and less than a week later, Square Enix has announced it has shipped and digitally sold 3 million copies. 
It’s a somewhat odd metric to parse out because copies shipped and sold aren’t the same. For example, a shipped copy might still be sitting on a game store shelf, while a digital copy sold is money made. Nonetheless, between physical shipped copies of FFXVI and digital versions purchased by players, Square Enix says it has reached 3 million copies sold. 
We’re delighted to announce we’ve shipped and digitally sold 3 million copies of Final Fantasy XVI on PlayStation 5. Thank you for your support! #FF16 pic.twitter.com/8YGfo1RXyV

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Indiescovery is recorded a week before we release it, and never has this small time delay been more apparant than in our latest episode. Last week the temperature in the UK was (pardon my french) bonkers boiling. As we are professionals we recorded this episode with all of our windows closed and our fans turned off in order to avoid any unwanted background noise. Choosing to do this while sat in a British house during a heatwave actually violates several human rights laws, and we've all since been arrested for crimes against ourselves.
Oh, we also talk about our favourite indies from this year's Not-E3, which probably highlights the slight time delay more than the heat thing because in video game industry terms Not-E3 may as well have taken place 30 years ago. But listen, indie games are always relevant, aren't they? Plus I got to do a bit where I pretended to be a games executive in the intro so as far as I'm concerned it all worked out well in the end.

Theorycraft is a relatively new studio made up of developers who, collectively, have worked on franchises like League of Legends, Valorant, Apex Legends, Overwatch, Destiny, and Halo. While the team has publicly talked about Project Loki (not the official title), today’s new trailer marks the first time the studio has shown it in action.

The real secret is to not pick passwords, it's to let software generate passwords for you, but I think I can pick a memorable yet secure password when required to. Well, I thought that until I played The Password Game, a free game you can play in your web browser. You simply need to pick a password which meets its rules, but it keeps introducing more and more which become sillier and sillier. It's a good joke and grows into quite a tricky puzzle game too. Plus it's free!

Remakes and remasters are more common than ever in 2023. What's most interesting is seeing how these new versions handle the issue of completely rebuilding versus simply making modern visual improvements. Story of Seasons: A Wonderful Life is a remake of Harvest Moon: A Wonderful Life that straddles the line between these two philosophies fairly evenly but still delivers an outdated experience in various aspects.
Releasing on modern consoles, Story of Seasons: A Wonderful Life initially looks like nothing more…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Monitor arms are brilliant. I've got three in my office, somehow, where they elevate my screens above my desk so that I can use all of the space below for my keyboard, mouse and other knicknacks without needing to awkwardly position things around the base of a monitor stand. They're a total game-changer that I couldn't go without - and thanks to this deal on Amazon US, soon you won't have to either. 
You can currently pick up a dual-monitor stand that accommodates two monitors up to 32 inches in size or 17.6 pounds in weight for just $15 when you use code LHEMYSVN and you're an Amazon Prime member. That's an incredible deal for a dual monitor arm that normally costs $46 and comes with over 15,000 ratings with an average score of 90%.

I've been playing Quantum Break since it arrived on PC Game Pass, and I'm finding their oft-forgotten time-bending shooter is yet another modern Remedy game full of boring gunfights even as it gives you supernatural powers that could replace guns. Their apparent disinterest in gunfights is especially felt in a game so into telling a story that it ends chapters with TV-length live-action episodes starring actual Lance Reddick. Looking back over their past games, agh, as much as I want spooky investigations, I can't get excited about their next, Alan Wake 2.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ever since the makers of Desperados 3 and Shadow Tactics announced their brand new squad tactics game, I've been dying to get my hands on Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew. While Mimimi's previous games took place in mostly grounded historical settings, Shadow Gambit is about magical undead pirates hunting for mysterious booty and fighting a persecutive Inquisition. This shift into the supernatural is quite the change for Mimimi, which creative director Dominik Abé tells me was partly to challenge themselves as designers, but also so players could have a bit more fun with how they approached its plentiful stealth encounters.
"One thing we wanted for sure was that we had something that's not grounded in a realistic setting," Abé tells me. "That was a requirement for all the pitches we did internally, and that's because we wanted to improve on the gameplay. We were restricted by realism, so that was a core pillar. It had to be something fantasy, or sci-fi or something non-realistic."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been excited to play Final Fantasy XVI for ages, but after hearing about Game of Thrones' influence on the game, I was afraid I'd be overwhelmed by dense fantasy lore. While worldbuilding can be as simple as creating fictional characters and cities, some creators dive in deeply, crafting pantheons of gods, hundreds of years of wars and conflict, and even entire languages. While it makes the world more believable, it can be incredibly disorienting for an audience to be thrust headfirst into a sea of unfamiliar proper nouns, especially before they have a chance to get to know the world's characters. Lucky for me, the developers behind Final Fantasy XVI completely anticipated this and introduced a solution: the Active Time Lore mechanic.

We’ve now learned, thanks to video game analyst group Circana, that it was, unsurprisingly, the best selling game of the month. However, it’s also already the second best selling game of 2023, behind Hogwarts Legacy. 
What’s even more impressive is that Circana’s Tears of the Kingdom numbers do not include digital sales for the game – only physical, according to Circana executive director Mat Piscatella. That it’s the second best selling game of 2023 on just its physical numbers alone means this game sold exceptionally well. And there’s a good chance it might be the year’s best selling game if digital numbers are one day added.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Publisher Dear Villagers and developer Fallen Leaf Studios have released a new trailer on IGN for Fort Solis, the upcoming sci-fi horror game starring Roger Clark and Troy Baker. 
This trailer starts with Baker discussing how he came to be involved with Fort Solis and why he’s excited about the game before he reveals it hits PlayStation 5 and PC on August 22. The trailer then cuts to new footage of the game, which you can check out for yourself below: 


As you can see, Baker says he joined Fort Solis because it allowed him to work alongside Clark (whom you might recognize as Arthur Morgan from Red Dead Redemption 2) and because he liked the story as well. As for the new Fort Solis footage, it shows more of the spooky Martian horror featured in the game. In it, Clark’s character, Jack Leary, tries to survive “through one long and terrifying night on Mars.” Leary appears to be guided, in some way, by Baker’s Wyatt Taylor and Julia Brown’s character, Jessica Appleton. 
Fort Solis hits PlayStation 5 and PC on August 22.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mortal Kombat 1 represents a bloody new era for the long-running franchise, and editors Marcus Stewart and Brian Shea have gone hands-on with it, most recently in this past weekend's online stress test. In this video, we take a look at the gameplay captured from this period that provides good looks at the movements and fatalities of the test's four available fighters, Liu Kang, Sub-Zero, Kitana, and Kenshi. You'll also get to watch those kombatants team up with three Kameo fighters: Kano, Sonya, and Jax.

        <updated>2023-06-26T16:01:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Publisher Humble Games and developer Crema have revealed Temtem Showdown, a new standalone battle-focused game, and it's out right now. 
This surprise reveal comes less than a year after the full 1.0 release of Temtem, the game that Showdown is based on. Similar to Pokemon Showdown, Temtem Showdown is all about battling. It's also free to everyone. 
"Temtem Showdown takes the best Temtem competitive action and places it within immediate reach for everyone," a press release reads. "Get to know the colorful critters from the massively multiplayer creature-collection adventure, build your team in seconds, and dash into battle to test it out against other players and their teams – or carefully curate a plan of action to overpower your opponents." 
Unlike Temtem, which is a multiplayer Pokemon-like game where you catch and train Temtem to use in 2 vs. 2 battles, Showdown will let players build a team from scratch right from the jump. And then you can hop right into a battle, without needing to worry about their level like you might in the base game. You can play against other players both casually and competitively, and the latter will feature a ranked system and a ladder to climb up as you play. 
Crema says Showdown will receive regular balance patches to keep the meta fair, and new Seasons will bring additional content and changes as well. 
For more, read our thoughts on the base game in Game Informer's Temtem review.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Between the Super Mario Bros. Movie and several announcements during last week's Nintendo Direct, Nintendo's mascot is having a great 2023. Carrying on the Mario momentum, Oreo announced a limited-edition cookie collab with the iconic Nintendo franchise.
The cookies feature 16 unique embossments starring characters like Mario, Luigi, Yoshi, Goomba, and Bowser Jr., as well as power-ups like Super Stars and Fire Flowers. Packs will be filled at random. Oreo is also holding a social media event where they're asking those who buy the cookies to stack as many of the hero-embossed cookies on the rim of a glass of milk without the cookies falling into the milk and share the video on social media in a concerted effort to save Princess Peach from Bowser's Castle.
"We hope to unite cookie lovers and Super Mario enthusiasts alike with this playful mission, inspired by a storyline fans know all too well," Oreo senior brand manager Vishnu Nair said in a press release. "We may even reveal a surprise as a thank you to those who successfully defeat Bowser and save the kingdom... Fans will have to wait and see!"
You can check out a fun musical trailer for the collaboration below.


The Oreo x Super Mario cookies will begin rolling out to retailers nationwide starting July 10, but will only be available for a limited time.

This news comes from yesterday's court trial between Xbox (and Activision Blizzard) and the Federal Trade Commission over Microsoft's attempted acquisition of Activision Blizzard. Bond claimed in court that, in the leadup to the launch of the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S generation of hardware in 2020, Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick said his company did not intend to put Call of Duty – presumably new, upcoming ones – on the Xbox platform unless Microsoft shared more revenue.

The update was announced in November 2022 as part of the game's 2023 roadmap.
The Sonic's Birthday Bash update adds new challenges, moves, and a new kind of collectible Koco for Sonic. The update also promises free birthday decorations for our hero, as well as the addition of New Game Plus. As is standard with most New Game Plus modes, you can begin the adventure from the start with all of your skill tree and power-up levels carried over into the new file.
Sonic's Birthday Bash arrives free to download beginning today at 5 p.m. PT / 8 p.m. ET. The first of three content updates arrived in March, adding a photo mode, Cyber Space Challenges, and Battle Rush mode, plus a jukebox featuring collectible songs from Sonic's past. The third update, which promises to be the most substantial, adds new playable characters and a new story and is set to arrive later this year.

As you might imagine, today's Sonic Central also shined a spotlight on the highly anticipated 2D Sonic game. We received a new trailer that showed off some new DLC coming to Sonic Superstars that features a collaboration with the Lego brand.
Players will be able to download a free Lego Sonic DLC skin to give the Blue Blur a new, bricky look. In addition, those who preorder Sonic Superstars will receive a Lego Eggman skin as well. You can see the new trailer below.


While Sonic is a recent addition to the Lego stable of characters, he appeared in the 2015 toys-to-life game Lego Dimensions, where he received specialized stages geared towards the speedy playstyle. However, it wasn't until 2021 that Lego officially greenlit a fan creation featuring Green Hill Zone from Sonic Mania. Then, earlier this year, Lego announced four new Sonic the Hedgehog Lego sets, which will be available in August.
Sonic Superstars arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC later this year. For more, check out our hands-on preview right here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We’ve all been there. You’re playing a game you really like; the action is tight, the visuals are impressive, and the systems are engaging. Then a character opens their mouth, and the dialogue and how it’s delivered is so cringeworthy that you’re ready to jump ship. Sometimes that’s bad writing. But when we’re talking about a game from a different part of the world, it’s just as likely that questionable localization is the culprit. 
Localization and translation are difficult. Doing it exceptionally well is exceedingly difficult. Often, minute cultural differences in how storytelling is delivered in different places can add up; in the aggregate, those minor differences can alienate players from another region. Another contributing complexity is the way that language, facial expressions, and…]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-06-22T19:17:40.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bethesda's Indiana Jones game, which is currently being developed by Wolfenstein developer Machine Games, will be exclusive to Xbox. 
This news comes from an ongoing court trial between the Federal Trade Commission and Xbox (and Activision Blizzard, which Microsoft is trying to acquire) happening today, which is where Bethesda's Head of Publishing Pete Hines revealed the game will be a console exclusive on Xbox, as reported by IGN. Like Xbox's other first-party releases, Machine Games' Indiana Jones game will also come to PC. 
However, Hines also revealed that Disney and Bethesda parent company ZeniMax originally signed an agreement that this Indiana Jones game would be multiplatform, meaning it'd likely also release on PlayStation. Hines says after Microsoft acquired ZeniMax in 2020, the agreement with Disney was amended to transition the Indiana Jones game away from a multiplatform release and instead, into one that will release exclusively on Xbox and PC.


Today's court trial also revealed that Xbox head Phil Spencer told Hines that Bethesda should look at title exclusivity on a case-by-case basis, IGN reports. As for why Indiana Jones was transitioned into an exclusive, Hines cited "reducing risk and trying to get a degree of clarity." 
"You're dealing with a licensor who is giving a ton of feedback on what you're making, is going to add a ton of time to your scheduling, these agreements, you don't get to take as long as you want, you have a window of time in which you're going to release a game, you immediately have a clock that's ticking on you," Hines said, according to IGN.
Bethesda revealed Machine Games' Indiana Jones game back in 2021 with a short teaser trailer, and that was the last we've seen of it. However, Bethesda head Todd Howard says he first pitched this Indiana Jones game way back in 2009. There's still no release window for the game today.

Editor's Note: The headline has been updated to reflect the game will also come to PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The wait is over! Final Fantasy XVI is finally here! I really enjoyed my time with it, giving it an 8.5 out of 10 in the official Game Informer review (which you can read here). From its explosive story to its fast-paced and robust combat, it’s a treat for any Final Fantasy fan, especially those looking for an extra dose of action. However, it’s still a Final Fantasy, meaning there are dozens of hours of content to experience, from the main story to the side quests, hunts, and more. 
With FFXVI now behind me after more than 65 hours (although I’m still tinkering with the idea of getting the Platinum trophy for it on PlayStation 5), I’m excited to share with you 10 tips and tricks I think you should know before getting started in FFXVI. And look, if you began FFXVI at midnight right when it…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Remakes tend to be more exciting than remasters because the improvements often go beyond mere bumps in resolution or framerate. At best, studios reimagine classic experiences in exciting new ways, sand away rough edges, and somehow retain the intangible x-factors that made fans fall in love with these titles in the first place. At the very least, remakes offer a great way to play antiquated or less accessible experiences on modern hardware. 
The remake boom has been in full swing in recent years to the point that it’s starting to get tough to keep track of all the projects in the works. Thankfully, we’ve gathered as many of the announced remakes (not remasters) that we could find and gathered them in one neat list, arranged chronologically by release window.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As I write this many of the development team and other members of the community are busy having fun at a meet-up in Brussels. Not me though, I’m stuck here doing a release. We’ve been busy refactoring quite a lot of the underlying code to make future changes easier, but along the way we’ve found and fixed a few more bugs and quality of life improvements that we figured were worth releasing sooner than whenever 14.0 comes along. Notably, OpenTTD will now automatically disable hardware acceleration if it detects that the last crash happened while initialising the graphics driver. While hardware acceleration works well for the vast majority of people, it causes crashes for people that then required command line arguments or manual config file editing to get it to work. This should be a better solution for those users. Additionally, there is a change to the default mouse mode on Linux to improve experience when dragging the map (and often to match expected behaviour in other games). As always, there are plenty of other bugfixes, which you can find in the changelog. While you’re at it, have you seen the post about the upcoming addition of a automated opt-in survey to OpenTTD 14? If you have opinions, we’d like to hear them! Details here. Download Changelog Bug tracker]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A stalwart party exploring the unknown, seeking the fabled Inner Sanctum. But all is not what it seems in the world of Varn...
The ScummVM Team is pleased to announce full support for the PC version of the first game of the Might and Magic series: Might and Magic Book One: The Secret of the Inner Sanctum. Two modes are supported:
The original look and feel of the game (sound, which in the original consisted of merely the occasional beep, is not supported)
A ScummVM-exclusive enhanced mode, which uses the interface of the later Xeen games, including niceties such as better character screens, automapping, and sound effects. It also integrates the impressive "Might and Magic 1 Graphics Overhaul Mod", which provides better in-game map and monster graphics. The xeen.cc file is required from Might and Magic: IV or Might and Magic: World of Xeen.
Both modes allow saving your game anywhere outside of combat via the ScummVM Global Main Menu (unlike the original game that only saved a single roster when checking into an inn). So make sure you save regularly, just in case you encounter problems.
Help us test both game modes by grabbing a daily build and adding mm.dat to the same folder as your game files. Read through our testing guidelines, and please take some screenshots along the way.
Now, go forth, and discover the true secrets of the game that started the long running epic fantasy series!
