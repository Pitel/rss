What's more relaxing than a farming sim? Many of us love to wind down with a few hours of tending crops, looking after cows, and taking in the seasons in a good ol' Story of Seasons game. And for almost 30 years, this hugely popular series has been sowing the seeds and setting the standard for the genre.
So what if it were to do something entirely different? The farmhands have swapped their hoes for pens and taken up a spot of picross. Piczle Cross: Story of Seasons marks the first time Marvelous' farming franchise has stepped out of the mulch and into a different genre. Can you get more relaxing than a farming-based puzzle game?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We’ve come to know our Pals pretty well over the last month since the game entered early access. We know their names, abilities, and skills by heart, it seems. Now, a recent Twitter post by Pocketpair has got fans of the game humorously questioning whether the same is true about the developers.


Eagle-eyed fans were quick to point out that not only did Pocketpair get the name of their own creation wrong, but they also seemingly used the wrong number from the Paldeck. Pal number 61 is actually Kitsun, not Blazehowl. Or should that be Kingferno?


Palworld fans left confused after Pockpair gets their own Pal names wrong




The team at Pocketpair was quick to notice and apologize for their mistake, but the post is currently still live with the blunder included. Bucky, the Community Manager for Pocketpair, entered the comments to note the mistake, too. 


Strangely, the video uploaded to YouTube at the same time also featured the mistake, but this has since been rectified. 


The post has prompted an interesting response within the comments, with many players stating that they actually prefer this accidentally mistaken name to the one Blazehowl ended up with. One commenter said, “I think we can all agree that ‘Kingferno’ is a much cooler name”.


Commenters on both Twitter and YouTube were also quick to point out that within the Technology Ladder, Blazehowl Noct’s Saddle is currently named “Dark Kingferno Saddle”, prompting many to speculate why the name was changed for the early access release.


There have been a couple of name changes since Palworld hit early access, with Ice Kingpaca and Ice Reptyro becoming Kingpaca Cryst and Reptyro Cryst, so it’s not outside of the realm of possibility to expect more name changes in the future, although it seems that Blazehowl is here to stay, even if some players prefer the alternative.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Palworld is full of modding possibilities, from replacing assets with funnier options to tweaking game settings in order to make it more enjoyable, there have been a lot of mods. 


Now, a new mod by Cristiferbeast allows you to play in first-person, right in the thick of things. 




Modders add a First Person view to Palworld


In the first few days after the game first launched on January 19, there was a glitch that left players stuck inside their own bodies. It caused some pretty gruesome moments, but this seems to have been fixed in a past patch. That said, it can sometimes be distracting to constantly be looking at yourself, especially during moments when you want to take in what you’re seeing without your character drawing your attention.


Cristiferbeast's mod fixes that by making Palworld essentially an FPS. The mod can be found on both NexusMods or CurseForge, and once you’ve followed the installation instructions and got everything set up, all you need to do to enable first-person mode is press Alt+C. To disable first-person mode and go back to the intended third-person view, you just need to press Alt+V. 


It’s worth noting that Palworld was never intended to be played in first-person mode. While this may seem like I’m stating the obvious here, installing and using this mod may result in some visual glitches or other issues. 


However, this may be a mod that’s of use to those who enjoy taking and sharing in-game screenshots in order to remove their character from the picture. Currently, there is no in-game photo mode, and it’s something that players are hoping to get in a future update.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When it comes to live service games such as Last Epoch, there are times when gameplay needs to be organized around maintenance and server downtime. With the game releasing fully on February 21, of course, there’s going to be maintenance, so here’s everything you need to know. 


During the Twitch stream Q&A on February 16, Last Epoch developers urged people to spread the word about the upcoming 24-hour server maintenance period, so here I am to do just that. 


If you’re wondering what you’re going to do while the game is inaccessible, you could always head over to r/games on Reddit, where the development team will be doing an AMA. Alternatively, you can check out our guide on what to expect once 1.0 lands. 


When is the next Last Epoch Maintenance?


Prior to the full release of Last Epoch, servers will be down for approximately 24 hours beginning at roughly 11 am CST (9 am PST / 12 pm EST / 5 pm GMT). Servers will be live again, provided no issues arise during maintenance, at the same time the following day and 1.0 will be live from this point onwards. 


Are Last Epoch maintenance periods always 24 hours?


Last Epoch server maintenance periods usually last approximately two hours, but it’s worth remembering just how many updates are being implemented in preparation for the launch of 1.0. 


This 24-hour maintenance is not something that’s likely to be repeated often, with perhaps the exception of future large updates. 


Other live service games, such as Final Fantasy XIV or Genshin Impact, regularly undergo longer periods of server maintenance in order to implement larger updates, so there’s no reason that Last Epoch would be any different.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Helldivers 2 is a somewhat unexpected success, currently sitting at the top of the PSN charts and taking over the hearts and minds of gaming everywhere. 


Unfortunately, it may be taking over too many hearts and minds, as developer Arrowhead Game Studios has found out with a slew of crashes and server instability issues. It's a good problem to have, but a problem nonetheless, which is why the devs have taken a drastic step to fix the problem. 


Helldivers 2 caps player count at 450k


Announced in the official Helldivers 2 Discord and reported on Twitter by Wario64, Helldivers 2 concurrent player counts have been capped at 450,000. 




It's a drastic step for a game that relies on multiplayer and may only further compound issues that have been frustrating players. Server failure errors and long log-in queues have been the name of the game for Helldivers to date. The game is actually just winding down a bonus XP weekend announced held to compensate players who had been impacted by previous server instability. 


Addressing these stability issues has been the top priority for Arrowhead, who rolled out a patch as recently as February 14 to attempt to further optimize matchmaking.


While the cap may not be the best news for players, they can find some solace in that Arrowhead regards it as a temporary issue, and are working to raise the cap further to allow for more players and better stability. 


Helldivers 2 is available now on PlayStation 5 and PC.

Rocksteady say addressing these is their top priority, although they ask for patience as the problems are "not an easy nut to crack."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The funky upbeat Foamstars soundtrack is now available on Spotify, Apple Music, and other platforms. The album consisting of multiple artists can be downloaded on your phone through these services.


"From up-beat electro swing, nu-disco and deep house tracks, to the chill beats of acid jazz and R&B, the album features a colourful intermingling of a wide range of genres that will make your heart sing," said Square Enix in a press release. Similar to its likely inspiration of Splatoon, the soundtrack is a true highlight of this fun-filled third-person shooter.

The album consists of 37 songs, including:

One of the artists involved in the project is J'Nique Nicole. Nicole is an American singer based in Tokyo. She provided backing vocals for Ashanti in 2013 and sang NieR: Automata's incredible "Weight of the World." She can also sing in Japanese. She has two singles, "Black Girl Magic" and "BAE." Nicole sounds fantastic in the Foamstars soundtrack.


Foamstars is currently available to all PlayStation Plus members on PS4 and PS5. When March 5 approaches, it will then be sold for $29.99. It won't be free-to-play.

Misjudge a particular jump by over- or undercharging it, maybe bounce back off a wall, and you may find yourself tumbling all the way back to the beginning again.

It's probably about to get a bunch of even harder levels, however, because nearly five years after release it has just got Steam Workshop support and a new set of modding tools.

Some people might understandably associate the Tomb Raider series, like WipeOut and Crash Bandicoot, with PlayStation. Lara Croft shot to prominence as the poster girl of gaming in the lad-mag era of the late-'90s and feels forever tied to the cultural gaming cornerstone that is Sony's debut console.
However, Core Design's original game launched for Sega Saturn and PC, too, and while Sony negotiated console exclusivity for the sequel, the series has appeared on practically every game platform made since the turn of the millennium, including Nintendo platforms. And with the release of Tomb Raider I-III Remastered on Switch, we're finally able to enjoy Lara's original adventures in their original form (almost).

While acknowledging that UE4 would be a better choice for the development of Palworld, Pocketpair had no previous experience with the engine and had to scale back its plans in order to get the game released, albeit a little late from the original 2022 planned release date.


At the time of writing, Palworld is stated to be about 60% complete, so there are a lot of planned additions to come. From the mini-Roadmap released last month, we know that PvP is on the way, as well as new Pals, bosses, and raids. However, there …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s always nice to have a way of discussing a game with its developers, and Last Epoch has provided a plethora of ways for fans to do just that. From Twitch Q&As to a thriving Discord, Eleventh Hour is always happy to talk to players, accept feedback and answer questions. 


Now they've announced they'll take it one step further with the team hosting a Reddit Ask Me Anything on February 20th at 11 am CST (so that’s 9 am PST / 12 pm EST / 5 pm GMT) on the r/Games Subreddit. 




If you’ve got any questions about the upcoming full release of Last Epoch on February 21, updates that may be coming or new features, now is your chance to get them answered. 


In case you’re wondering why Eleventh Hour isn’t performing this AMA on the Last Epoch dedicated Subreddit, they’ve already answered that question. 


“Before people start asking why we aren't doing the AMA here, this specific AMA is for a broader audience. We spend a LOT of time here, and we consider this to be our home. We don't plan to leave, and this isn't a symptom of 'LE got too big for us!'; it's just a part of the process of growth that we get asked to host events in other places."


With that in mind, if you are holding onto a burning question for the team, make sure to get to the Subreddit early, as they will be answering questions on a first come first serve basis.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hasbro, the parent company that owns the Dungeons & Dragons license, has raked in $90 million in royalty fees since the release of Baldur's Gate 3, according to a Bloomberg report. The 2023 Game of the Year for many outlets has been a massive success with a 96% review rating from over 500,000 Steam gamers. 


"Baldur’s Gate 3, last year’s most critically acclaimed video game, has brought in about $90 million since its August release for parent company Hasbro Inc. through a licensing deal," wrote Bloomberg's Cecilia D'Anastasio. 


Despite the $90 million in revenue, Hasbro has laid off many of its staff. It cut 1,000 of its full-time staff in January after taking away 900 jobs over the past few months. CBC News reports 29% of Hasbro's workforce has been let go. This came after a reportedly weak holiday season.

Despite that horrible news, the universally beloved game was given Game of the Year from The Game Awards over steep competition like The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and Marvel's Spider-Man 2, among others. It also just won the coveted prize from the DICE Awards. 


Despite the game's 1.0 release back in August, developer Larian Studios is still updating Baldur's Gate 3 six months later. In today's sixth patch, unique kisses have been added to the game for each romancable character. 


"All characters now have unique kisses that reflect their personality, with an emphasis on the plural," said Larian Studios in an update blog on Steam. "These kisses are randomised and vary from the incredibly romantic to… uh, a little more intense." Additionally, new idle animations have been added in the camp to "help your campsite feel more alive." Other gameplay modifications have been added.

Yes, this week didn't bring the Direct announcement that many of us had foreseen, but there was still plenty of juicy news in the world of Nintendo. Microsoft announced that it will be sending four games cross-platform, but it cryptically wouldn't announce the titles nor their platform destination. Hmm. Elsewhere, Sonic Superstars got a creepy Shadow DLC, Nintendo announced another eShop sale and Splatoon 3 put a date on its next season update.

This one is a bit different to the average new release because it's a remake of the 2004 Game Boy Advance title with a few new worlds, co-op mode and a new casual difficulty setting. We rather enjoyed the Switch version, but we're now curious to know if our community will be picking it up.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Skull and Bones is finally out today. Let's play the opening hour and see if it is worth wait. Reportedly, the game began development as early as 2013 and spent a few years as an Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag spinoff before turning into Black Flag MMO, before finally emerging as a standalone game announcement in 2017. In the six years since its announcement we've seen teases of it here and there, had chances to play in various betas and alphas, and it even appeared on our cover in 2022. Skull and Bones has been a long time coming, but today everyone is finally able to play it. Our full review isn't ready quite yet, but you can  read Matt Miller's positive early impressions so far by heading here. You can also check out an hour of gameplay below.

The list, published by Inflexion Games, describes changes coming to Nightingale before its Early Access release on February 20. Below are some of the highlights from the list:

The studio's community manager, Bucky, seems to feel the same if their recent Twitter post is anything to go by. 


It's not very often that a game, especially one from a smaller studio, becomes as much of an overnight success as Palworld did. The stories of broken records came thick and fast: millions of players, concurrent player counts, the likes of which are rarely seen, and Pocketpair pumping out the patches to resolve issues as fast as possible.

Ah, the Sega 32X. I own more games for that growth of a console than anyone should. One of the easiest to find, and one that I’ve owned since I picked up the console, is Star Wars Arcade, which is an expanded home port of the, well, arcade version. 


One thing to know is that the 32X was nowhere near as powerful when it came to 3D as the Sega Model 1. However, one of the things I kept hearing about Star Wars Arcade was that playing it out in the wild was very expensive.

I originally started my own pirate journey in the Skull and Bones open beta earlier this month, since the progress made in the beta carried over to launch. The beta had a cap on progress which I reached after about eight hours of playing, but I had enough fun to make me want to continue my progress on launch.

The use of 8-Bit in describing indie games that use either a voxel or pixel art style has always irked me. It’s less common now, but it was very popular as the retro gamer identity started to take hold. A pet peeve is all. However, Petroglyph has been in my mind since I learned they are still updating 2006’s Star Wars: Empire at War. That kind of love and commitment toward their community is laudable.




9-Bit Armies describes itself as and easy to learn, difficult-to-master real-time strategy game. While I’m not a fan of the voxel art style, it touts two-player cooperative campaigns, maps that are 400% bigger than the original, and naval warfare. You can also build and destroy bridges, which may not sound very exciting, but bridges have extreme strategic importance in real wars, and this rarely gets translated into strategy games.


In terms of its Early Access release, Petroglyph says, “The core game is largely in place, with both factions fully playable and a full campaign to play through.” The goal of Early Access is to open it to a larger player base and collect feedback to improve it on top of just adding content.


9-Bit Armies: A Bit Too Far releases on PC Early Access on February 23, 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Devolver Digital has announced that Cricket Through the Ages, the absolutely normal take on the sport from Terra Nil and Broforce developer Free Lives, is escaping mobile confinement and releasing on PC and Switch on March 1.


As a Canadian, I know next to nothing about Cricket. I’ve actually asked people close to me if they even know the rules, and no one does. Here’s my guess based on reading Life, the Universe and Everything: A guy throws a ball at a wooden block that is held up by three short poles. A guy with a flat cudgel tries to prevent the ball from hitting the structure and knocking the block from the top of it. However, there are a bunch of other guys surrounding this duel, and I have no idea what they do.


That’s my guess at how Cricket is played.




Thankfully, it doesn’t look like I need to know the rules for Cricket Through the Ages, a game that celebrates the extensive history of the sport. It seems to be aiming to give a deep dive into the sport and should teach me everything I need to know. It looks like one of those wacky physics-driven games that are intentionally difficult to control. People are throwing things at each other. One of the scenes actually looks like what I think the sport looks like, but they’re playing with a beach ball.


It looks fun. The press release I have says that it uses a “simple, one-button control scheme.” It has six game modes and can be played by yourself or against your most hated enemy. They also promise that you will, "learn about the totally real history of cricket. You won’t believe it."


Cricket Through the Ages was previously only available as part of the Apple Arcade service on iOS, but is now coming to real video game devices. It releases on PC and Switch on March 1, 2024.

It may not be my personal Game of the Year, but I feel Baldur's Gate 3 is a very important game deserving of its accolade. Not only is it fun to play, technically impressive, and narratively endearing, but it’s also complex in a way that most big-budget games don’t reach for. I’ve said to a few people that I appreciate it because it has tricked the mainstream into playing something that isn’t designed to be as approachable and widely appealing.


This is somewhat echoed in the acceptance speech made by director Michael Douse and head of production David Walgrave. In an awards show where they were actually allowed to talk about their creation, Douse spoke…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last Epoch exits its beta on February 21 and as such, there’s a lot of news and reveals happening in the run up. Part of the run up is a collaboration with actor David Harbour, who worked with developer Eleventh Hour to create an in-game item for Last Epoch.


David Harbour is pretty much a household name, at this point. If you’re unsure who I’m talking about, you’ll undoubtedly know him as Jim Hopper from Stranger Things, but he has had starring roles in everything from blockbuster movies like Hellboy to Theatre plays like Hamlet. And in games, he’s lending his voice as Edward Carnby in the 2024 remake of Alone in the Dark. 


Harbour is a lifelong gamer, having previously revealed that he plays World of Warcraft, so his Instagram post explaining his love for Last Epoch shouldn’t come as much of a surprise. 




While disclosing that the post is indeed a hashtag-ad, Harbour goes on to explain his love for Last Epoch, thanking the team at Eleventh Hour for allowing him to collaborate with them on the in-game item. Although he offers no specific details about the item, Harbour concluded the post by promising to share more as soon as he could before encouraging people to buy the game before its release. 




Eleventh Hour took the time to comment on David’s post, saying “Just like in this post, when we met David we could all feel the genuine passion he had for the game and the collaboration. Thank you so much for the shout out - we’re all looking forward to showing off the item you designed for the community.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[How does some bonus XP sound, divers? Helldivers 2 developer Arrowhead Game Studios announced via Twitter that a bonus XP weekend will be in effect for the frantic third-person shooter effective immediately. The bonus XP will last through the end of February 18 and will grant all players XP and Requisition at a 50% multiplier on top of your base mission score.




A true Hell


According to Deputy Game Director Sagar Beroshi, a current problem is causing some player rewards to not pay out properly upon mission completion. A fix is in the works, but the event is intended to help alleviate the impact going into the weekend.




Unfortunately, Helldivers 2 has had somewhat of a rocky launch, primarily with matchmaking and server stability. But a recent patch seems to have fixed a lot of the issues, and even with them, diving is just so damn fun. Not to mention how cool it is already fighting a new threat.


I've only played a few hours, but I've had a blast. Sure, I'm getting overwhelmed by armored spitting bugs, my friend constantly accidentally teamkills me with a grenade launcher, and I always seem to unintentionally drop right into the middle of a massive swarm, but that's what puts the Hell in Helldivers right?


Helldivers 2 is currently available on PC and PlayStation 5. The bonus XP weekend is active on both platforms now through the end of February 18.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As an outgrowth of the naval combat experiences in the Assassin's Creed series, I've been curious about Skull and Bones since its announcement as a standalone title in 2017. Since then, the game has seen numerous delays and fundamental reworks on the development side. Our cover story on the game captured one moment in the evolving project’s life in the summer of 2022, and it has continued to change in the months that followed. In recent weeks, some sentiments on the internet and in gaming communities have concluded that, by this point, the game that is releasing must be a mess.
I’m happy to report that’s not the case; Skull and Bones is a lot of fun.
Review access only opened up a few days ago, and the game on offer is exceptionally dense and large, so we’re still working on pulling togeth…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cheating and fraudulent activity are an issue for all live service games, but one that seems to be suffering more than most at the moment is Palworld. Since launch, some players have reported issues with strangers infiltrating their servers, destroying their bases, and even preventing access to servers entirely. 


Pocketpair have today released a statement on Twitter addressing these issues and outlining measures that they plan to introduce to combat cheaters trying to spoil other players enjoyment of the game, stating: “As a company, we do not tolerate any fraudulent activity or cheating, and we are working on measures to deal with it strictly and as a priority.”




The first measure outlined in the Twitter post is the introduction of a player list on multiplayer servers, allowing players and hosts to identify uninvited players and potentially boot them from the server. The hope is that this will also allow for players to receive suspensions by the development team in the event of dishonorable gameplay. 


Pocketpair are also planning to introduce an ‘external anti-cheat solution’, although they don’t name software or give details as to how this would work, in order to ‘take measures against particularly frequent fraudulent activities and cheating’. They do note that this feature will be optional for those who play on community servers and those who play single player and co-op.


They also noted that while the team try to deal with issues on a daily basis, sometimes there are cases where they are unable to keep up and they apologized for this before going on to say that they’re working hard to get the game back to a state which allows players to enjoy it comfortably.

If you have a) been enjoying Cobalt Core as part of RPS Game Club this month, and b) especially like it when Soggins turns up with his ship of malfunctioning missile launchers, then I implore you to make Sunshine Heavy Industries your next port of call in your Steam library. It's what the Cobalt Core devs Rocket Rat Games made first, and you can immediately see a lot of shared DNA between the two games - not least its chunky, charming pixel visuals and some crossover between its cast of characters - including our pal Soggins. 
It is, I should stress, a very different game to Cobalt Core - it's a sandboxy spaceship builder with zero combat involved, for starters - but I've been playing it again this week ahead of some other Game Club-themed articles I've got cooking, and I've been having a lovely time with it. Not least because I get to spend more time with Soggins the very smug frog, all while listening to even more excellent chill tunes from Cobalt Core composer Aaron Cherof.

That is precisely what the developer Matt Dabrowski's latest developer vlog focuses on.


The sheer scope and ridiculousness of the original Streets of Rogue was very impressive back in the day, allowing players to, say, smash buildings wide open as a giant gorilla. You could also be a jock, an investment banker, or a shapeshifter just to list a few character classes, each allowing you to tackle the game's many proc-generated objectives however you see fit.

Even though Bungie hasn't prepared the strongest of send-offs with the Season of the Wish, better updates are on the way, and Update 7.3.5, in particular, could be an interesting showpiece.


More specifically, Bungie's latest This Week in Destiny blog specifically outlines Update 7.3.5, which is due to launch on March 5, with sandbox changes taking the most of the limelight. Exotics such as the Manticore SMG and the Vex Mythoclast fusion rifle are being (slightly) buffed, for example, and almost every weapon class is getting a tweak of this or that kind. Further, there are big PvP changes in tow, with the nerf to the infamously powerful Threaded Specter Warlock subclass being particularly notable.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As influential as the original Doom games are, it'd be interesting to know how much they'd stand the ravages of time were it not for modding and unusual ports. It set the building blocks for the FPS genre back in the day, but the fact that people continue to tweak the original formula shows just how much of an impact the series has had these past 30 years.


Sometimes mods will even incorporate other horror franchises. Take this one that mixed Doom with Friday The 13th. Inspired. Now, here's one for us Alien lovers, in which the iconic Xenomorph creatures have made their way into id Software's classic shooters.


Image via SlegInfantryman/ModDB.


Brought to us by ModDB user SlegInfantryman, "Xenomorph Infestation" is an upcoming mod for both Doom and its sequel featuring a "fully functioning Xenomorph hive that will grow organically featuring the whole life cycle." We can see how the images bring the two ideas together.


Now we just need Ripley fighting imps


At the moment, the mod is in alpha stage, with no finalized release date yet. SlegInfantryman has said it's more for testing at this point, but it's available to download as a demo.


Here's what they have to say about it in response to a comment on the mod page:



This is the alpha version which I was mainly using to test and make sure the Xenomorphs functioned correctly in infesting maps. If you run the Xenomorph infestation.pk3 alongside one of the other pk3 files included, you can watch them take over a map.




In any case, it's a bit of fun to see them running around like excitable kittens in the world of Doom. There seems to be quite a few of these mods already, which suggests the two franchises are just natural bed fellows.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Square Enix announced the Meister Quality Hydaelyn & Zodiark figure back in January, along with its associated in-game emote Apocalyptic Charades, players were left shocked by not only the price of $350 but also by the accompanying emote's limitations. According to the item description, Apocalyptic Charades was character locked. 


This means that the emote would only be usable by one character associated with the buyer's account, something that left many disappointed, considering the fact that FFXIV allows you to have multiple characters. For $350 dollars, it seems pretty fair to assume it's account-wide.


It wasn’t altogether surprising, though. When the Meister Quality Omega figure was released in 2020, the associated Omega Simulations emote was indeed character locked, so buyers …]]></summary>

Actually, we basically covered the gist of this patch before, but now that it’s out in the wild, we can cut it open and see what’s inside. As I lead with, the biggest addition is a tonne of new kissing animations. Beyond just kissing, the patch notes highlight they’ve “improved” some of the final cinematics to “better reflect the connection between players and their partners.” Ladies.


There are some smaller tweaks as well, but the other big ones for me are improved idle camp animations and better speaker prioritization in dialogue. The game will now default to your avatar as the speaker whenever dialogue automatically triggers …]]></summary>

The latest bit info dump sent out by Atlus and Vanillaware does just that, as well as detail some of the more strange and fascinating allies Prince Alain can recruit in his quest to liberate the world of Unicorn Overlord. It's not all swords, bows, and magic, after all. We've got bestial races to recruit, and they've got quite a bit of Vanillaware flair. Plus, a combat system that reminds me of the Gambit system from Final Fantasy XII? Let's take a look, starting with the characters:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm kind of fascinated by what happened to Hello Neighbor. The original, a stealth horror game against a creepy AI that learned your likely movements, was hugely popular in alpha in 2016. The series was acquired by TinyBuild in 2020, and since then there has been a heroic number of spin-offs. There's one set in an amusement park, a multiplayer game called Secret Neighbor in which one small child is actually a large adult man in disguise, a direct sequel called Hello Neighbor 2, and a VR game called Search And Rescue. I think everyone got a bit of Neighbor fatigue there, lads.
This might include the original creator Nikita Kolesnikov, as (still under the auspices of TinyBuild) he's made a new thing. Currently on Steam for playtesting, the project currently known as RBO isn't falling far from the home invasion tree, as players will either be a home-owning Protector - a McCallister, if you will - or an Intruder, or Wet Bandit.

        <updated>2024-02-16T14:02:16.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last year's Alan Wake 2 was a triumph, not only in the survival horror genre but in AAA gaming in general. Given the high praise, it's no wonder we declared it one of our favorite games of 2023. And for good reason, too.


As well as great reviews all around, the Alan Wake follow-up has also been selling well. According to developer Remedy Entertainment, the long-awaited sequel has sold 1.3 million units, as of February 2024. A post on the developer's website says it's the fastest-selling game the company has ever released "so far."




Indeed, it's not been out for too long, so time will tell how big the game can get in terms of sales, especially once DLC hits. By comparison, Control has sold over four million units since it launched in 2019. However, AW2 has sold "over 50% more copies and over three times more digital copies in its first two months" than that.


Awards, they keep a-comin'


On top of this, Remedy was proud to announce that Alan Wake 2 recently received the DICE Award for "Outstanding Achievement in Art Direction." That's one more accolade to be thrown on the pile, right next to such wins as "Critics Choice Award" at Golden Joystick, "Best Direction" and "Best Narrative" at The Game Awards 2023, as well as some others.


Selling 1.3 million units in just a couple of months is mighty impressive, even if you take into account the fact that the game was launched not long before the holidays.


Of course, we also need to consider that Alan Wake 2 is a digital-only release. Whether you agreed with that decision or not, one can't help but wonder how many more could have been sold by now if there was a physical copy available as well.

When you’re going off to battle, you want to bring your best and strongest warriors with you. In most games, these fighters come in the form of muscle-bound, gun-toting avatars of destruction. In Yaza Games' Inkulinati, your champions are the odd animals that litter the pages of medieval manuscripts, led across the battlefield by the hand of an easily distracted artist.
That is the crux of what makes Inkulinati unique and clever – you are not playing as any of the creatures on the field of battle. Instead, you are playing as the person drawing them, whether they are a knight engaging in scholarly pursuits or a monk spending their days painstakingly recreating a single copy of an important tome. Each of the units you spawn is scribbled into existence by this unseen person, something that, for better or worse, drives every gameplay mechanic you encounter.

ZA/UM, the developer behind the sublime CRPG Disco Elysium: The Final Cut, is reportingly planning to lay off 24 workers after cancelling its next major project, codenamed 'X7'.
This comes via Sports Illustrated's GLHF, which reports that the 24 workers currently at risk make up roughly a quarter of the studios total workforce. Meanwhile, project X7 is understood to be an expansion of Disco Elysium, though GLHF also reports that Argo Tuulik, the last remaining writer to work on Disco Elysium, is one of the staff members on the potential chopping board.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Because it’s somehow my job to worry about the technical fidelity of electronic toys, I’ve been eyeing the long-overdue arrival of Skull and Bones with some nervousness. After nearly a decade of delays, you’d probably just want to get it out the door, right? Skip straight to the open-world pirate adventuring, none of that 'making it work on a range of graphics cards' nonsense.
But nope. For all its other shortcomings, Skull and Bones performs alright on PC, very often more smoothly than its system requirements suggest. Though I’d still recommend abiding by its SSD storage requirement – following the rules might not be very piratey, but installing on a hard drive will curse you to some pretty tedious load screen waits. Geoffrey Rush would hate it, honestly.
While Edwin sequesters himself in the starting area, let’s head below deck for a closer look at Skull and Bones’ PC particulars. That includes a full rundown of its graphics options – which include ray tracing and DLSS – and a quick guide to the best settings for an ideal prettiness-to-performance ratio.

Ahead of the game's launch, developer Matt Dabrowski has started releasing a series of dev diary videos detailing his design process and how it's all coming together. The latest is about how he creates the game's proc-gen open worlds and biomes, and it's a fascinating watch if you've ever wondered how its particular blend of randomised chaos works behind the scenes.

With today's release of the Sora amiibo for Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, the collection is complete. Every fighter now has a corresponding figure (excluding alternate costumes), Sakurai has announced that development is over, and Nintendo has put together a neat image to mark the occasion.
Shared in a post on Twitter, Nintendo highlighted all 94 Smash Ultimate amiibo in one beefy graphic. We wouldn't have thought that a collection of plastic figures could look quite so epic, but we'd be lying if we said that we didn't want to see this released as a poster.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As promised earlier this week, Microsoft and Xbox executives Phil Spencer (head of Xbox), Sarah Bond (president, Xbox) and Matt Booty (Head of Xbox Game Studios) got together today to share some important "updates on the Xbox business." You can check out the full update below, but the headline is that four future formerly Xbox and PC exclusive games are coming to other consoles, but Spencer was not ready to reveal what those games are. They are games that are more than a year old that have been on Xbox and PC for awhile. A couple of the games, Spencer says, are community-driven and service-based games that have reached their full potential on Xbox and PC. They are franchises that Xbox wants to continue to invest in. Two are smaller games that were not built to be platform exclusives. Though he wasn't ready to share the game titles, he did confirm that Starfield and Indiana Jones are not in that group.
According to sources reported by The Verge, it seems the four titles may be Hi-Fi Rush, Pentiment, Sea of Thieves, and Grounded.
Spencer cushioned everything he said, presumably in expectation of pushback from Xbox fans by saying, “We make every decision with the long term health of Xbox in mind.” He also made sure to remind everyone that Xbox already has games on other platforms, calling out Minecraft in particular. Spencer also briefly touched on the company's decision to lay off over 1900 employees, though offered little in terms of reasonable rationalization.
Bond also mentioned that Xbox is looking forward to and making plans surrounding future hardware and vaguely promised a substantial leap in technical prowess, but offered little in terms of concrete details.


The podcast also confirmed Activision/Blizzard games are coming to Game Pass starting with Diablo IV on March 28 and that we can expect a new Xbox showcase in June.]]></summary>

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/02/15/ea-sports-college-football-25-arrives-this-summer-full-reveal-in-may"/>
        <updated>2024-02-15T18:07:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s been three years since EA announced it was making a new college football game after a years-long hiatus. Dubbed EA Sports College Football 25, not much has materialized about the game since its reveal in the way of updates, but the publisher has broken its silence with a new trailer confirming a release window and promising a bigger look at the title in the near future.
The video heavily leans into the skepticism fans have expressed over College Football’s existence, proudly expressing, “Yes, the game is real” while showing off snippets of behind-the-scenes development footage. The snazzy video doesn’t do much besides that, but it ends with a promise of a full reveal in May and a summer launch window. 


EA Sports College Football 25 is being developed by EA Orlando (formerly known as Tiburon), the team behind the Madden games. This will be the first college football game from the publisher since the demise of its NCAA Football series, the last entry of which was released in 2013. The franchise was shelved due to a 2014 federal lawsuit in which the judge ruled that the NCAA’s long-standing rule prohibiting college athletes from being compensated for their in-game likenesses was unlawful. 
With Name, Image, Likeness (NIL) rules now in place in college sports, players can now be paid for appearing in advertisements or products. That would, of course, include video games. EA Sports struck a deal with OneTeam Partners to broker deals with players to include their NIL in the upcoming game. However, this was met with resistance from school/player licensing agency The Brandr Group last summer, which filed a lawsuit to prevent EA from conducting such deals with OneTeam Partners. Both entities eventually agreed to a settlement in November, dropping the lawsuit (thanks College Football HQ). 
We don’t know what platforms EA Sports College Football 25 will target, but that answer should hopefully come in May’s larger update.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new trailer for Princess Peach: Showtime shows off some more outfits and abilities the Mushroom Kingdom’s pink monarch has up her royal sleeve. 
Princess Peach: Showtime pits Peach against the villainous Sour Bunch, who crashes a performance at the Sparkle Theater. Its guardian, Stella, grants Peach the ability to transform and gain powers based on the costumes she dons. Stages take the form of different theater plays with ever-changing sets. 
The video introduces Figure Skater Peach, which sees her gracefully skating across a winter-themed stage and performing spins to take out enemies. The Dashing Thief costume gives Peach a Carmen Sandiego-esque look and vibe as she uses a retractable grappling hook to zipline and swing across 2D levels while evading security bots. Mermaid Peach grants a siren-like singing voice used in what appears to be a type of musical mini-game. Mighty Peach basically turns the Princess into a Super Sentai-like hero battling aliens using super strength and a jetpack to take out foes mid-air.


Princess Peach: Showtime is coming to Switch on March 22. Nintendo is also launching pink rose-colored Joy-Cons for the occasion.]]></summary>

Declaring your game "the spiritual successor to Freelancer" is bold and ambitious, considering how the spaceship sim is still so beloved after 20 years that our readers voted it your 16th favourite space game of all time. This ambition is wild when the tiny development team is led by someone best known for replacing Skyrim's dragons with Thomas The Tank Engine. So while I'm not much of a spaceship sort, I had to check out the demo for Underspace, which aims to combine Freelancer shoot-o-trading space action with a dash of Lovecraftian horror.

Tracking technology has many pitfalls, including how Google Maps can be accidentally used to track people, and the fact that if you systematically turn off cookies, your internet browsing experience becomes increasingly bizarre. I am offered adverts for afro hair care products and huge bags of puppy kibble, because the algorithms no longer have any idea who I am or how many small dogs I have. And yet.
Surely this technology has reached the point where, if I open a game for the first time in several weeks, it should be able to tell I haven't played for a long time, and ask if I would like a small refresher of the controls.

You will be shocked and aroused to learn that I preface with all this just so I can make an exception of Islands Of The Caliph. Does this mean she's becoming more open minded, or just that she's found a way to gripe and complain even within a recommendation? Who can say, readers.
What I can say is that I don't merely hate it less than its genremates. I think it's a bloody great little RPG, full of charm and detail that never drags it down.

He's an ungrateful little sod if you do rescue him from certain doom, but I kinda love him for it anyway - and thanks to an industrious pair of modders, you can now have Soggins join your crew to inflict his own special brand of personal chaos on you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you told me at the start of the year that Palworld would break Steam records, I would've done a hearty "no no" chuckle. But here we are, with the survival game exceeding 19 million players and Pocketpair probably wondering how they managed such a feat. With its success has come the inevitable slew of impatient people saying the game's dead because it's not received updates fast enough, or folks saying it's lost a hefty percentage of its player base, and others saying its viewership numbers over on streaming services have plummeted. Palworld's community manager Bucky has gently reminded folks that not only is this discourse "lazy", but to play other games instead.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Embracer have released their interim financial results for Q3, October-December 2023, in which they share details of the conglomerate's on-going efforts to "restructure" and reduce their massive debts, to the tune of hundreds of layoffs over the past year. 


Amid the talk of revenues, profits and losses, we learn that Embracer have laid off 8% of their global workforce since announcing their restructuring program in June 2023. According to the report, Embracer's total headcount has fallen from 16,243 in the period October-December 2022 to 15,218 in the period October-December 2023. The number of Embracer studio game projects in development, meanwhile, has fallen from 224 to 179.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Readers, consider this is a public service announcement for (deep breath) Tomb Raider I-III Remastered Trilogy Starring Lara Croft. Do not, for the love of all that's ancient and holy, play this game with its newly-added modern control scheme. The original tank controls are by far and away the best (and only real) option for going back and experiencing Lara's OG adventures from the late 90s, and I'm not just saying that out of nostalgia. The modern controls are bad, plain and simple, and are as much an enemy to Tomb Raider's incredibly precise mode of 3D platforming as the tigers and wolves that stalk its trap-filled catacombs. They are utterly maddening, and the antithesis of everything Tomb Raider stands for. I implore you, do not go anywhere near them, for your own sake as well as Lara's.

Helldivers 2 will "never" get a PvP mode, according to Arrowhead's CEO Johan Pilestedt. The reason? They want to avoid encouraging any toxic behaviour in the new shooter's multiplayer community.
Given that Helldivers 2 is a game with mandatory friendly fire in which you can kill team-mates by respawning right on top of them, I fear the Good Ship Camaraderie may already have sailed, but I'm very early on in my Helldiver career, and I'm... intrigued by how Arrowhead's efforts at community curation sit alongside/within the game's premise of playing a dirty space fascist locked in an endless xenophobic crusade.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The RTX 4070 Super is a rather good deal, offering a significant boost in gaming performance over the earlier RTX 4070 - in fact, it's closer to the 4070 Ti than the vanilla 4070. That makes it a great choice for gaming up to 4K, while costing just a bit over the £500 mark - £539 to be accurate after a £50 discount that puts it below the UK RRP of £579. 
That price is for a relatively modest Zotac Twin Edge model which fits easily even into small form factor PC, but thanks to the efficiency of the Ada Lovelace architecture the card should still run quite cool and quiet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Fantastic Four finally arrive in the Marvel Cinematic Universe next year, and Marvel Studios has officially revealed who will don the team’s iconic blue suits.
The Fantastic Four was first announced in 2019 and is scheduled to premiere next year as the second film in Phase Six of the MCU. In a sweet Valentine's Day message, Marvel announced the following actors will portray Marvel’s First Family: 
Happy Valentine’s Day from Marvel’s First Family! Pedro Pascal, Vanessa Kirby, Ebon Moss-Bachrach, and Joseph Quinn are The Fantastic Four.

Reed Richards/Mister Fantastic - Pedro Pascal (The Last of Us, The Mandalorian)
Sue Storm/Invisible Woman - Vanessa Kirby (Napoleon, The Crown) 
Johnny Storm/Human Torch - Joseph Quinn (Stranger Things, Overlord)
Ben Grimm/The Thing - Ebon Moss-Bachrach (The Bear, The Punisher)
Pedro Pascal has been on a roll lately, starring as Joel in HBO's The Last of Us, portraying the titular Mandalorian in The Mandalorian, and starring in films such as The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent, and the upcoming Gladiator 2. Vanessa Kirby made her name portraying Princess Margaret in the Netflix series The Crown, most recently played Joséphine in Ridley Scott's historical epic Napoleon, and has appeared in the recent Mission: Impossible films as Alanna. Stranger Things season 4 fans know Joesph Quinn best as the season's breakout character, Eddie Munson. Ebon Moss-Bachrach has recently been known as Richard "Richie" Jerimovich in the FX series The Bear and as Arvel Skeen in the Star Wars series Andor. 
WandaVision director Matt Shakman will direct The Fantastic Four, though its story details remain scarce. The Fantastic Four is scheduled to hit theaters on July 25, 2025.]]></summary>

Because now, in time for the season of romance, they've teamed up with sex toy purveyors Uberrime to create a frankly prohibitively massive dildo as an official tie-in for the game, which can be won in a free competition by three lucky people living in either the UK, EU, US or Canada (as in, they each win their own dildo; they don't have to time share).
I mean I say "prohibitively", but I don't know your life.

In Helldivers 2 it isn't actively encouraged, nor is it punished. Accidentally vaporising your teammate with an air strike is all a part of the campaign for democracy and freedom, a hilarious byproduct of human error. I gushed about it in my review, and cheery RPS fanzine PC Gamer wrote up a quick piece on the specific ways it eeks out silliness.
But comedy isn't just accidental in Helldivers 2, oh no. I think it encourages playground behaviour of the worst order: smacking your mates into things.

Ys X: Nordics was first released in Japan last September and will come stateside this fall. It will be available for PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Granblue Fantasy: Relink is a JRPG that is ticking off many of the action RPG tropes. It would be in danger of becoming workmanlike, such are the number of things you can tick off on your fingers like a plumber ordering parts: boss fights against improbably huge glowing monsters, an evil god, catboys, numbers popping off enemies, women who appreciate the combat applications of a thigh-high split skirt, anachronistic sunglasses, horned giants carrying halberds of the same approximate size as a caravan.
In practice, though, you sort of can't be mad at Granblue Fantasy: Relink. It's built around a layered combat system that seems impenetrable if you don't take some time to understand it. But really, Granblue Fantasy: Relink is just a game so committed to the rule of cool that the entire setting is physically impossible, and every battle is a disorientating Panic! At The Firework Factory that flirts with being a photosensitivity nightmare. I'm not selling it as such, but it's actually charming.

If you missed it, the trailer in question focuses on the "modernised" combat. It shows alleged "everyman" protagonist James Sunderland getting all Gears of Warry with some maggoty marionettes and rancid demon nurses.

A developer can take many different approaches when remaking a game, but its primary goal always remains the same: to create a new experience that honors the spirit of the original. With Mario vs Donkey Kong, a remake of the 2004 Game Boy Advance title of the same name, Nintendo succeeds in this goal. By combining new worlds and modern quality-of-life features with the game's classic, delightful puzzle design, Mario vs. Donkey Kong is a strong start to Nintendo's 2024.
In the game's opening, Donkey Kong raids a toy factory where they make Mini Marios, the hottest new product on the market. To get them back, Mario must chase him down through eight worlds…]]></summary>

Ordered by the number of unique players that spent time with them during Next Fest proper (meaning all those early demo plays from earlier in the month haven't been counted), the most popular game of the lot was one that was only formally announced right at the end of January. So congratulations Dungeonborne - your blend of PvPvE dungeon crawling and fantasy skelly monsters clearly struck a chord with this year's Next Festers.

It shouldn’t work, surely. It would be easy to look at this spin-off and question why it takes the co-op out of one of the best co-op games on PC, or to shovel it aside as a cynical attempt at latching onto the popularity of autoshooters/Survivors-likes/bullet heavens (delete as preferred). But you’d be a smooth-handed leaf lover, my friend, as not only does DRG’s mix of horde shooting and rock smashing translate remarkably well to the format, even this early access version is heaps of subterranean fun.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[By now you'll probably have read quite a bit about our preview adventures in Inflexion Games' upcoming fantasy survival adventure Nightingale - including our slightly raucous attempts to interview CEO Aaryn Flynn while instant KO-ing tree monsters and abusing our supplies of ice bullets. But outside this guided co-op session, several members of the RPS Treehouse were playing it on their lonesome last week, too, getting to grips with Nightingale's particular flavour of sticks-and-stones crafting, cooking up meat and berry wraps to keep ourselves fed, and generally being cajoled and maybe even lightly seduced by our fae Shakespearean guide, Puck.
With so many folks playing it - some diehard survival heads and others who are mostly just glad to be having a break from Palworld for a spell - it quickly became apparent that lots of us had quite different takes on how Nightingale worked as a craft 'em up. I swear, I don't think our RPS Slack chat has ever seen such passionate discussions about UI layouts and hotkey assignments, so we thought it might be fun (and useful) to try and distil some of those thoughts for you. Will Nightingale succeed in capturing survival newcomers with its peculiar blend of gaslamp tea leaves, or will it chaff like a Victorian corset for the survival hardcore? Join us as we discuss some of its finer points below.

Still, they're doing their utmost as the game becomes PlayStation's biggest PC release to date. And the latest patch brings with it a slew of crash fixes, reductions to disconnects, further tweaks to matchmaking, and preps things for future server improvements.

There's something about that game's isometricky vantage point and precise combination of 2D pixel characters and 3D environments. The last sentence describes many virtual worlds of the late 90s, but none have stuck in my mind like Port Parm: that hodgepodge of green and rusty roofs, the canals cutting through the cobblestones, the smoky chimneys and people filling the alleyways. Bliss. I can still hear the seagulls blowing around the screen. 


Oh sorry, I rhetorically lost myself for a minute there! I'm supposed to be telling you about Terra Memoria, a new RPG featuring time travel, magic crystals and animal wizards. Here's a trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[DC Universe Online developer Dimensional Ink Games and its publisher Daybreak Game Company have been hit with layoffs. 
According to Kotaku, Dimensional Ink lost an unknown number of senior staff, with Game Developer reporting reductions in the art, community, and narrative departments. The team is best known for developing the superhero MMO DC Universe Online. Daybreak Games (formerly Sony Online Entertainment) has worked on several multiplayer games, including EverQuest II, H1Z1, Star Wars Galaxies, and Planetside 2. The exact number of affected employees from both studios is currently unknown. 
This is, unfortunately, the latest of an alarming trend of game industry layoffs that plagued 2023 and have only intensified in 2024. Over 5,500 jobs have been cut within January alone. Last year, over 10,000 employees in the games industry or game-adjacent industries were laid off. 
Among others this year, Embracer laid off 97 employees at Deux Ex developer Eidos-Montréal, Destroy All Humans remake developer Black Forest Games reportedly laid off 50 employees, Microsoft laid off 1,900 employees across its Xbox, Activision Blizzard, and ZeniMax, Outriders studio People Can Fly laid off more than 30 employees, and League of Legends company Riot Games laid off 530 employees.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Helldivers 2 is a third-person co-op shooter that's centred as much around action as it is comedy. Gigantic insects and red-eyed robots threaten the sanctity of Super Earth and, frankly, this isn't on. As a Helldiver, you must team up with your compatriots and pulverise these menaces for freedom (a shoulder-mounted laser cannon) and democracy (an aerial bombardment). Seriousness is reserved for the act of extermination, which adds tactility to the familiar motions of a shooter, making for horde management that promotes efficiency and frequent lapses of judgement in equal measure. Helldivers 2 is a slapstick masterpiece.

Thus begins the wolves' hot pursuit - not least because this robot also seems to be kind of sleeper agent for them - and your roguelike-shaped quest to avenge your fallen friends.

Right now on Steam you can grab a free copy of RPG Maker XP, an older version of the wildly popular (and quite accessible) game-making tool. It might be fun to kick around an idea or—who knows—maybe you've even got the next To The Moon (made in RPG Maker XP, don't you know?) rattling around up there, waiting to manifest.

A few days ago, Motion Twin announced that the 35th major Dead Cells update, aptly titled The End Is Near, would be its last. Benard feels this is a betrayal of both the game's community and its current development team, Evil Empire, a spin-off studio who took the reins in 2019.

One example is the Kingston NV2, a 1TB PCIe 4.0 SSD going for just £50 on Amazon UK at the moment - some £14 below its UK RRP.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We’ve all been there. You see a chair in a game. It prompts you to sit. Curious, you oblige. 
Your digital butt meets the seat, and…nothing. You just sit and stare for a few seconds before rising and continuing your adventure. More often than not, sitting does not result in a cutscene, reward, character dialogue, or, in some cases, even a good view of your surroundings. You just sit. 
You could be slaying a mighty dragon.
You could be rescuing your captive friends.
You could be discovering the true meaning behind your existence and your place in the cosmos.
But instead, you sit. 
With some exceptions, taking a seat in games equates to a whole lot of nothing. And yet, it remains a regularly recurring mechanic. So why do we sit? Do you like to sit? How long do you sit? Should sitting still be a thing in games? Please take a seat and discuss your stance in the comments below.]]></summary>

While we're no closer to knowing the exact details of the event, we now know the "where" and "when": the announcement will happen on the official Xbox podcast this Thursday, February 15. The episode will be posted at 12 PM Pacific/3 PM Eastern

The podcast in question will feature more than just Xbox head Phil Spencer, however. Sarah Bond and Matt Booty, the Presidents of Xbox and Xbox Game studios, respectively, will also give updates on the future of the brand. 
There are a few likely candidates for discussion. The most recent is the report that Xbox exclusives would begin coming to other platforms, including Hi-Fi Rush, Starfield, and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. Speculation around this news has taken many different directions, with some even theorizing that the loss of exclusivity implies Xbox might stop making consoles altogether. A report from earlier today, however, says that this isn't the case.
The other topic on the table is the company's most recent round of mass layoffs, where over 1900 employees were let go from the company, and a Blizzard survival game years into development was canceled. While Blizzard and Microsoft have since asserted that the layoffs would have happened with or without their notorious merger, the FTC filed a complaint. Either for gamers, employees, or the regulatory bodies of the world, it's a viable point of discussion.
When the podcast is posted on Thursday, you'll be able to listen to it on Xbox's YouTube channel right here.

If you’re still reading, congratulations, you’ve either got a dangerously high tolerance for bad literary jokes or you’re really eager to hear about Nightingale, the new survival sim from Inflexion, which launches into early access on 20th February. A quick recap on Nightingale, in case you missed our early access preview today: it's a strongly British-influenced "gaslamp fantasy" experience in which players travel alone or in groups between procedurally generated fairy realms using magic portals. You can build bases in each Realm, go on story quests and hunt the wildlife for crafting materials.
Last week, RPS adventurers Edders, Kiera, Jeremy, Ollie and myself had a chance to play co-op with Aaryn Flynn, Inflexion’s CEO and former general manager at BioWare, while chatting to him about the game over Discord. The resulting, not entirely planned group interview lasted two hours and consisted mostly of people yelling at each other about ice ammo and tree monsters, but we did find time for some proper Q&A. Please find below an abbreviated transcript.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I first saw Never Grave: The Witch And The Curse rising up the Steam Next Fest charts at the end of last week, I thought, "Oh! That's a neat Hollow Knight-looking Metroivanida roguelike, I'll definitely give that a go." And having played its demo over the weekend, I can confirm: it's certainly an intriguing little thing that I'll be keen to keep an eye on when it launches into early access, possibly sometime next month. 
The biggest surprise was that, despite its very Hollow Knight-looking visuals, it actually plays more like Dead Cells in practice. Instead of being a sentient lump of flesh able to inhabit infinite bodies, you're a magical witch's hat that can possess, discard and rematerialise your chosen sack of limbs at the touch of a button. The second thing that surprised me was that it also has quite a substantial base/village building aspect to it on the side, and the third - well, perhaps this isn't so much of a surprise given everything I've just said, because it also turns out this is the next game from Palworld developers Pocketpair. Yep, it all makes a bit more sense now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["Banishers took a while to kick in," I wrote in the RPS group chat last week, "but I fought a monster made of angry witch-hunting jam last night." It was a pivotal boss fight about half way through Don't Nod's ghost hunting action-adventure RPG Banishers: Ghosts Of New Eden, and typical of the over-the-top, slightly ridiculous, but entirely earnest drama of the game that joyfully pulls you along. Don't Nod - who I am starting to suspect make their magic teen angsthologies to fund their real passion for "grimdark grown-up fantasy that you sort of suspect should be a book series" - have followed up 2018's third-person action effort Vampyr with this new semi-epic.
Banishers has a lot in common with the interwar bloodsucker, including methodical investigations and stacking moral choices, but is a much more accomplished effort. Banishers combines a sweeping, tragic love story with some very decent swashbuckling, shooting possessed skeletons in the face, and being disappointed at Puritans. A perfect game, some may say. I'd elevator-pitch it to you as a sort of goth Uncharted where you find-and-replace "treasure" with "ghosts".

They're a group of game devs based in Melbourne who formed a gang (the titular Grannies) of older people in Rockstars rootin', tootin' cowboy RPG Red Dead Redemption 2 - specifically Red Dead Online. In the pursuit of fun,  The Grannies, using a glitch known to a lot of the community, broke through the invisible walls in the game's wild west and into another, wilder west - a landscape nobody was really meant to see.
Marie Foulston, a curator who specialises in installations focused on video games, made a short documentary film about them and what they saw in 2019. Now V Buckenham (who has made many things, but may be known to most as the creator of Cheap Bots Done Quick!) to present The Grannies to watch for free online, in an immersive website experience that itslef looks like a glitching out landscape.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The major thing Inflexion's fantasy survival sim Nightingale gets right is that it makes procedural generation feel like sorcery. "Procgen" has become a ubiquitous concept in game design and especially survival game design, and I fear we've all lost sight of how magical it is to summon a landscape full of idiosyncratic flourishes from a hidden dataset. It's partly, in fairness, that many semi-randomised settings feel indistinct, smooshed together with little of the character you'd get from a "hand-made" environment and setting. Nightingale slices through the ennui in a couple of ways. 


One is that this is a relatively storied and text-driven survival experience, with a self-summoning fairy narrator, Puck, who immediately buries you in Shakespearean turns of phrase as he weaves the history of a multiple-dimensional universe of "Fae" realms, roamed by creatures of Irish, English and Scottish myth and legend. I'm not sure Puck will be everybody's cup of tea as principal quest-giver and narrator - according to Inflexion boss Aaryn Flynn, some early players have struggled to make head or tail of his dialogue. But he helps conjure up an eldritch mood that sets Nightingale apart from most genre fantasies, including the Dragon Age titles Flynn once worked on at BioWare.

Made by a former Arkane level designer, it's about a train maintenance job at a border post atop the world's tallest mountain, where the air is so thin you need to huff top-ups from cans. Concrete information on Threshold is a bit thin at this point but I can tell you that you have a bucket and some planks, so what more do you need to know? Check out the announcement trailer, below.

But Arrowhead CEO Johan Pilestedt has offered some comfort, saying that they've popped three hotfixes live to fix some of these issues.

This week brings at least one major news event in the shape of a "business update" from Microsoft about "our vision for the future of Xbox", which is widely rumoured to be the announcement that first-party Xbox titles will come to rival consoles. Why is this of interest to us, a PC gaming site? Well, because console gaming can't help but shape the weather for PC gaming; more specifically, Microsoft's alleged multiplatform ambitions seem to reflect the plateauing of Game Pass subscription growth, which has become the cornerstone of the Xbox biz.

Not only is it one of the most visually vibrant games of the year so far with its neon colour palette that's an instant-KO-to-my-eyeballs, but the way it twists and rewires core tenets of the Metroidvania rulebook also make it one of the boldest and most daring examples of its genre. I'll say it now: it doesn't always stick the landing. But if there's one thing Ultros does constantly throughout its 15-odd hour runtime, it's that it's always, always interesting. And for that, it has my respect - even if by the time the (first) end credits rolled, I was ready to never touch it ever again.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With the recent Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Volume 1 and the upcoming Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, Hideo Kojima's iconic tactical espionage action franchise has been on our minds. And miraculously, somehow, across approximately 588 episodes of Replay, we have never revisited Metal Gear Solid. This week I am happy to correct that monumental mistake.
We will get back to Majora's Mask soon (Marcus is out on assignment this week) but we took that opportunity to revisit one of, if not the, best PlayStation games with Metal Gear Solid. It just so happens that Alex Van Aken is playing through the game for fun, so I asked him if we could just jump into his save for an hour. And you know what? It just so happened to be one of the best hours of the whole game. Alex takes out Liquid Snake in the HIND, meets the invisible overweight soldiers, and defeats Sniper Wolf. It's a fantastic snapshot of a fantastic game.

In the latest episode of his YouTube series, HideoTube, Kojima says that returning to the same genre as Metal Gear was inspired by players asking for it "every day on social media", and by a brush with death he experienced in 2020.

Or if you could recommend it to those who haven’t played it without needing to explain away the parts that haven’t aged well? In today’s gaming landscape, remasters are common, but we’ve seen an influx of full-on remakes of classic role-playing games in recent years.
While 1990’s Ys I & II is likely the earliest example of remade role-playing games, perhaps the most prominent early examples came in the form of the Pokémon franchise. Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen, 2004 remakes of the series’ debut titles less than a decade after their initial release, showcased the technological leap from original Game Boy to Game Boy Advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My excitement for Final Fantasy VII Rebirth went into overdrive this week. Not only did we get 20 more minutes of its gorgeous open worlds, mini-games and story nuggets to gawp over this week thanks to Sony's dedicated State Of Play stream for it, but the internet has also been awash with previews, interviews and all sorts of other Final Fantasy-shaped goodies. Honestly, it's like a second Christmas for me over here at the moment, it's great. 
But one thing that really stuck out to me this week was a comment made by series producer Yoshinori Kitase in an interview with our friends at Eurogamer. When they asked him why remake Final Fantasy 7 at all, his response hit me much harder than I was expecting. He said that the original FF7 is "probably going to be always that game my dad played, and I don't want it to be that." Aside from making me crumble to dust with irrelevancy, this really got me thinking about older games, the way we play them now, and just what role remakes and remasters have in today's PC gaming landscape. So come and feel incredibly old with me as I try and get my (very jumbled and loosely-related) thoughts in order.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Helskate is a rogue game where you are trying to escape Hell on a skateboard. The game is heavily inspired by the Tony Hawk series, which makes sense as its game director, Steve Swink, worked on Tony Hawk's Underground. Join me and Game Informer's resident Tony Hawk expert, Blake Hester, as we play a bit of the game, discuss its Tony Hawk overlap, and what sets it apart.
Helskate is entering early access on February 15.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When playing any character-driven videogame I sometimes experience a sensation akin to my eyes unfocussing, and remember that I'm not, strictly speaking, controlling a body in a world, but interacting with a simulation that includes representations of a body and a world. The character is just an interfacial node in a vast tangle of visible and invisible elements; by moving the character, I cause objects, surfaces, creatures to load or unload, spring into motion or change colour and a million things besides.
Some games foreground these interdependencies by fictionalising the simulation as a giant organism or ecosystem, a more intriguing kind of "living, breathing" environment which is aware of your presence within it. Amongst these games is Ultros, a side-scrolling, psychedelic metroidvania - or as developers Hadoque might prefer, "gardenvania" - which launches next week.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dead Cells developers Motion Twin have announced their roguelike Metroidvania will receive its final update with the launch of the appropriately titled Update 35: 'The End Is Near'. It's been a pretty great run as these things go: over the course of seven years, Dead Cells has received four major DLC expanions, a mobile release and, of course, 35 of those big title updates. However, current custodians Evil Empire are now moving on to greener, "secret projects"-flavoured pastures - the emphasis being on pastures plural there, if their Xweet about it is anything to go by, too.

Each visit to a planet lasts as long as the song, whisking us through scenes reflecting the lyrics and mood, rendered with a mix of 3D computer art and a range of handmade physical mediums. I was delighted from the first twang. And impressively, it's mostly the work of one developer, Claire Morwood. Do have a look!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dead Cells was developed and released by Motion Twin in 2018, and in an atypical move in the world of game development, members of that team branched off to form Evil Empire, which in turn supported Dead Cells with new content for many years. Arguably its biggest and most notable expansion was the Return to Castlevania DLC, which added all kinds of Castlevania content to the game.
The developer announced this morning, however, that it is officially time to move on. You can see the developer's full statement below.
After 5 years of service, we're hanging up the Dead Cells coat. We're extremely proud of our work on countless updates & DLC, but now it's time for something shiny and new, or maybe more than one thing 😏 More on that very soon...

Along with issuing apologies for any broken controllers related to the Derelict Distillery addition, Evil Empire also shared its appreciation for being able to add so much to Dead Cells. It also wrote, "The good news is that our Dead Cells team have been unleashed to pump their talent into our secret projects, and we'll be revealing what their crazy minds have been coming up with very soon!" while also wishing luck to Motion Twin's next announced project, Windblown, and teasing perhaps more than one project.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In an upsetting confirmation that February is in fact winter (and that the year doesn't just start with summer like my brain thinks it should) publisher Whitethorn Games held a 2024 Winter Showcase, where they revealed the existance of a game that answers the question "what if the slimes in Slime Rancher were in mortal peril, and had swords?". The answer is apparently "be ruddy heroes in a cute Soulslike". I think this game, too, looks very cute, although Slime Heroes doesn't have a release window yet.
You know what does have a launch date now? Botany Manor, a lovely 3D puzzle game about growing plants, which I first learned about via the Steam Next Fest demo, and with which I immediately fell in love. I am heartened to know it is coming out really quite soon - April 9th. A mere two months from now!

Access real devices with Device Streaming in Android Studio

Device streaming in Android Studio lets you securely connect to remote physical Android devices hosted in Google's secure data centers. Powered by Firebase, it's the fastest and easiest way to test your app against real devices, including the Google Pixel 8 Pro, Pixel Fold, select Samsung devices, and more.

After connecting to a device, you can deploy your app, view the display, interact with the device (including rotating or unfolding the device), and anything else you might do with a device over a direct ADB over SSL connection—all without leaving Android Studio. When you're done using the device, Google wipes all your data and factory resets the device before making it available to another developer.
During Open Alpha, you can use Device Streaming at no cost. To get started simply sign into your Developer account from Android Studio and select a Firebase project. If you don't already have a Firebase project, it's easy to create one. To learn more, go to Device Streaming in Android Studio.

General fixes and features
Below is a list of general fixes in Android Studio Jellyfish | 2023.3.1 Canary 9 and Android Gradle Plugin 8.4.0-alpha09 These are a result of your bug 
reports, which help us to make Android Studio better. If you encounter a problem, let us know by reporting a bug. You can also vote for an existing issue to indicate that it also affects

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Overwatch 2 has had a rough road following the early success of the first game. That game, which easily earned Game Informer's Game of the Year in 2016, started with such promise and a massive, enthusiastic audience, but following the 2019 announcement of Overwatch 2, support for the original Overwatch floundered, and so, too, did the community. Last year's release of Overwatch 2's PvE elements in its Invasion update pushed the hero shooter back in the right direction, but it didn't make the splash Blizzard had hoped for. With Overwatch 2 Season 9, which kicks off next week, Blizzard is making a ton of sweeping behind-the-scenes changes to make the game more approachable for players.

Speaking of which, Persona 3 Reload has shot to the head of Atlus's ranking of fastest-selling games, shipping over a million copies worldwide in its first week.

Originally released on the PlayStation 2, Persona 3 was the first game in its series to define its modern formula, combining social responsibilities with dungeon crawling and a lengthy, emotional story. It's been re-released multiple times and was even ported to modern consoles last year, but even the upgraded versions don't hold a candle to the mind-bending masterpiece that is Persona 5 Royal. Persona 3 Reload closes that gap, however, introducing overhauled visuals and mechanics to bring the game that started it all up to the level of quality fans of the series have come to expect. If the sales numbers and our glowing review are any indication, the upgrade has been well worth the wait.
To put these numbers in context, here are some other games that have recently reached comparable significant milestones: Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth shipped 1 million copies as of Feb 1, Nintendo's quarterly report revealed Tears of the Kingdom has sold 20 million copies, and viral hit Palworld continues to smash record after record.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Funimation and Crunchyroll, two competing anime streaming services, merged in 2021 and announced in 2022 that all of the content would eventually combine under the Crunchyroll banner. That event officially has a date, and it's April 2.
For Funimation subscribers, you will have to go through the process of merging your account before the April 2 date, and, frustratingly, any shows that were outright purchased through Funimation will not transfer to Crunchyroll. Just another reminder that when you purchase digital content, true ownership does not technically exist and you will always be at the mercy of the platform holders when it comes to access.
Crunchyroll subscribers do not need to make any changes, but the price of the subscription will rise to $100 a year soon. The merger officially going through does mean Crunchyroll will feature more content, but a price increase will always be frustrating.
Alongside this merger finally completing, Crunchyroll is also entering the video game space as a publisher. It remains to be seen what kind of video tames the anime company will help produce, but you can check out this package it sent over on Game Informer's TikTok account.
As a subscriber to both services who somehow has managed to continue to have a need for both (Outlaw Star is curiously currently only available on Funimation) the merger is bittersweet. I embrace the simplicity of one anime streaming service but don't look forward to paying more, and will forever be wary of mergers being a good thing.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Sonic the Hedgehog Movie spinoff series, Knuckles, is premiering April 26, and ahead of its streaming debut, Paramount has released a trailer. The series officially takes place between the second and third movie and will apparently follow Knuckles (Idris Elba) has he helps Wade (Adam Pally), Tom Wachowski's (James Marsden) bumbling police partner, become a true warrior. The trailer also reveals the antagonist will be played by Rory McCann, who is best known for playing Sandor 'The Hound' Clegane in Game of Thrones, and features a two-thirds Human Giant reunion cameo with Rob Huebel and Paul Scheer. Curiously, they're sitting at an ESPN8 The Ocho desk, a gag born from the 2004 film Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story that eventually became a real thing.
Other interesting details from the trailer? Jim Carrey does not appear, nor does James Marsden, but both Sonic and Tails appear and are played by film voice actors, Ben Schwarz and Colleen O'Shaughnessey.


The series, simply titled Knuckles, will be six episodes long and begins streaming on April 26 on Paramount+. For more on the Sonic the Hedgehog Movie universe, you can read our review of the second film here.]]></summary>

The first teaser trailer for Harold Halibut was released seven years ago and was only a minute and a half long, but it immediately grabbed my attention. The footage showed a stop-animated Harold (or what looked stop-animated) cleaning up graffiti in an underwater facility. The striking visuals inspired a thought I don’t often have – how did they do that? It was my first question for game director Ole Tillmann and art director Onat Hekimoglu when I recently spoke with them.

Having traveled to Japan to spend two days in Square Enix's Tokyo headquarters with demos and interviews, then reporting on it through our previous issue's cover story and subsequent exclusive coverage hub, I already had an idea that I would be a fan of what Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, the second entry in the Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy, brings to the table.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Project Orion is still a deeply mysterious game. We know it is a follow-up to Cyberpunk 2077, we know CD Projekt Red is developing the game in North America (Boston, specifically) as opposed to Poland where the main studio is based, and eventually development will expand to Vancouver, with support from the main Polish headquarters. Beyond those details, we don't know much. Implications from CD Projekt point to it being a sequel, but it could be a spin-off, or something entirely different. Of note, Project Orion was a study from the 50s and 60s about the viability of nuclear power for space travel. Maybe that's what CD Projekt's Cyberpunk 2077 follow-up will be about.
We may not know much about the game, but based on a press release from CD Projekt this morning, we now know some of the folks who will be working on it. Dan Hernberg is now a Project Orion executive producer who was head of production at Amazon Games, and also has history at Panic Button and Blizzard Entertainment.  Ryan Barnard was a game director at Massive Entertainment and Ubisoft, but perhaps most notably, was the gameplay director at Hitman for developer IO Interactive. Barnard is joining Project Orion as a design director. Alan Villani is now an engineering director on Project Orion and worked on several Mortal Kombat titles. Anna Megill is a Project Orion lead writer with history on titles like Control, Dishonored: Death of The Outsider, Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, Guild Wars 2, and the upcoming Fable from Playground Games. Alexander Freed is an additional writer on Project Orion and is a New York Times bestselling novelist and comic book writer who previously worked at Bioware on Star Wars: The Old Republic and more.
We're eager to learn more about Project Orion, but suspect it will be some time before we do. For more on Cyberpunk 2077, follow the link to read Game Informer's review of Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty. You can also read about how CD Projekt has no interest in being acquired here.]]></summary>

It's also always interesting to watch the list of best-selling Switch games, which you can find here. Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is still king, now boasting 60.58 million units sold. Animal Crossing: New Horizons is in a distant second with 44.79 million units sold and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is in third with 33.67 million units sold. The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Super Mario Odyssey take fourth and fifth place, respectively.
Nintendo also confirmed what we all suspected, writing in its report, "The Super Mario Bros. Movie, released in April, had a positive impact on sales of Mario related titles. As a result, there were 24 titles that sold over a million copies during the period, including titles from other software publishers." It also mentions in the report that Super Mario Bros. Wonder is the fastest-selling Super Mario title to date.

Years ago, when I first heard about the provocative title for Rocksteady’s follow-up to the Arkham games, I recall wondering what mental gymnastics were in store to not actually murder the well-liked central characters of the DC mythos, including the version of Batman the studio had so expertly developed over prior titles. Credit where it’s due: Rocksteady followed through, and Kill the Justice League does just that. Unfortunately, it also killed my interest or enthusiasm through a story that feels juvenile and…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft had a strong start to 2024 thanks to their Developer Direct Showcase, but it sounds like we'll get even more information on what the gaming giant is up to very soon. Head of Xbox Phil Spencer gathered the attention of gamers everywhere this afternoon with a post announcing an upcoming "business update event." You can see the post for yourself below.
We're listening and we hear you. We've been planning a business update event for next week, where we look forward to sharing more details with you about our vision for the future of Xbox. Stay tuned.
February 5, 2024
The post itself doesn't have any concrete details on what to expect, but there's a likely subject. Just this morning, The Verge reported that Indiana Jones and The Great Circle, one of Xbox's biggest first-party games of the year, might be headed to PlayStation after a short exclusivity window. Combined with other recent rumors, like Hi-Fi Rush and Starfield coming to other platforms, it seems like Xbox might be loosening its grip on its exclusive games. That said, Spencer didn't give us any idea as to what the announcement would be about, so we'll have to wait until next week to know for sure.
For more on Xbox's plans for the coming year, check out some of the reveals from the Developer Direct, like Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, Visions of Mana, and Avowed.
What do you think Xbox will announce next week? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

In addition to touting an AI learning opponent feature for Master Duel and VR experience with Duel Links, a collection of classic Yu-Gi-Oh titles served as the big new game announcement.
Dubbed Yu-Gi-Oh! Early Days Collection, this compilation consists of the very first Yu-Gi-Oh games ever released, including titles only available in Japan. Konami only revealed one game in the collection: Yu-Gi-Oh Duel Monsters 4: Battle of Great Duelists for the Game Boy Color, which launched in Japan in 2000 and never came to the West. 
Yu-Gi-Oh Early Days Collection has no release window, but it will be available for Switch and PC via Steam. Konami plans to announce the other titles in the collection in the future, so you can start building your wishlist now. There are a ton of Yu-Gi-Oh games (to say the least), but as a long-time fan, I’ll be happy if Forbidden Memories, The Eternal Duelist Soul, or (perhaps less likely) The Duelists of the Roses make the cut.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is one of the biggest Xbox exclusives on the horizon. According to a new report, however, Microsoft might be thinking of bringing Indy to other platforms.
The Verge has spoken to an insider familiar with Microsoft’s plans who claims the publisher is considering the idea of bringing several first-party titles to other consoles, like releasing Indiana Jones on the PlayStation 5. The source claims that Bethesda is tentatively targeting a December release for the title and that it will launch as an Xbox/PC title before possibly coming to PlayStation 5 after a short exclusivity window. 


Remember that nothing has been officially announced or confirmed, so take this report with a grain of salt. It’s worth noting, though, that during Microsoft’s trial with the FTC over its acquisition of Activision Blizzard, Bethesda’s then head of publishing, Pete Hines, testified that parent company ZeniMax had initially signed an agreement with Disney to make Indiana Jones a multiplatform game. Microsoft later amended this deal to make the game an Xbox exclusive after it acquired ZeniMax in 2020, with Hines explaining the decision was made in the name of "reducing risk and trying to get a degree of clarity."
Microsoft’s rumored multi-platform approach has garnered plenty of speculation in recent months. The publisher is reportedly looking to bring first-party games like Hi-Fi Rush and Sea of Thieves to rival platforms in the near future. Starfield is also rumored for a PS5 launch, as reported by XboxEra. 
Indiana Jones and the Great Circle was first announced in 2021 and had its full reveal during the Xbox Developer Direct last month. The first-person action-adventure romp stars Troy Baker as Indy in a story set between Raiders of the Lost Ark and The Last Crusade. The game is slated to launch sometime this year for Xbox Series X/S and PC.

While various action scenes served as fan-pleasing sequences, the series was maligned among the community for simply not feeling true to the source material. In addition to focusing on too many side characters and interpersonal drama, the series also took far too many liberties with its main protagonist, Master Chief. With Season 2 starting on Paramount+ this week, I sat down with Xbox's head of IP expansion and entertainment Kiki Wolfkill and Halo Season 2 showrunner and writer David Wiener to learn more about the direction they're taking.
According to Wolfkill, who has worked on the Halo series since her role as executive producer on Halo 4 in 2012, …]]></summary>

For now, we need your help testing our work. We need as many people as possible to test this beta version of the 14.X release series, so you can find and we can squash as many bugs as possible before the actual release. To guide you a bit towards what you should be looking for: Generic gameplay bugs and crashes. There is a new Ship Pathfinder; test it out. Buoys are optional to use. You can now automatically unbunch your vehicles at a depot. We added our own interpretation of daylength to the game. More on this soon in another blog post. There are many GUI improvements throughout the game. More consistent look, better GUI scaling. There are many more things worth talking about, and this will be made more clear when we approach the release of 14.0. But for now, play the game, and please report any issues you find.

It’s so densely packed with weird stuff that, upon repeat viewings, I actually had to go out of my way to pinpoint anything remotely mundane. In a humorous turn of events, Death Stranding 2 is so overwhelmingly odd that every eye-brow-raising visual element is par for the course. Anything that isn’t a black oil-covered tube baby with a hilariously literal moniker voiced by Troy Baker is now the minority and, in turn, the “weird” stuff.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time reinvented the series in 3D and became its new gold standard, Nintendo followed up with a surreal sequel in Majora's Mask. Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days. Majora's Mask's unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.
Join Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard today and each Friday on Twitch at 2 p.m. CT as they gradually work their way through the entire game until Termina is saved. Archived episodes will be uploaded each Saturday on our second YouTube channel Game Informer Shows, which you can watch both above and by clicking the links below. 
Part 1 - Plenty of Time
Part 2 - The Bear
Part 3 - Deku Ball Z
Part 4 - Pig Out
