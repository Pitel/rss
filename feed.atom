        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Steel Spin ability is one of the many changes made to A Universal Time (AUT) as part of the 4.0 update, and you'll want to get your hands on this specific option as soon as possible.


It's a brand-new ability that offers incredible power and efficiency at clearing in-game content. Upon obtaining the ability, you'll get a mystical technique known as "The Spin." Upon activating it, you'll launch projectiles that can do an incredible amount of damage.


How to obtain the Steel Spin ability in A Universal Time (AUT)


While obtaining this ability is not a difficult task, you'll need to fulfill certain prerequisites. First, you'll have to equip Standless, and this is mandatory. You'll need Standless if you want to unlock the returning Tusk ability and all its evolutions. Unlike Steel Spin, Tusk has four different evolutions that you can unlock.


Coming back to the ability in discussion - you'll have to open Epic Chests equipping Standless. The item you're looking for is the Altered Steel Ball, but the process is completely random. There's no guarantee that an Epic Chest is going to drop an Altered Steel Ball, so you'll need to take your chances.




If you can't find one on the first try, the only option is to get more Epic Chests. This can be done by defeating stronger enemy groups like Sorcerers. You can find such groups in the Desert, and beating them will help you get a lot of rewards. But it's safe to say that finding an Altered Steel Ball will be a tedious and repetitive process (unless you suddenly get a bout of good luck).


Once found, the Altered Steel Ball can be used to unlock the Steel Spin ability. That's pretty much it when it comes to this specific power-up, but make sure not to miss out on all four evolutions of Tusk. Here's the full guide as to how you can unlock all the evolutions spread across four different acts.

They give you several very powerful skills that let you create chances from nothing and finish from seemingly impossible angles.

S
Nagi, Shidou


A
King, Bachira, Isagi


B
Chigiri






Nagi and Shidou are the best styles on the attack in Blue Lock Rivals. Nagi's mid-air trap is just OP because you can't steal the ball away from him while he is doing it. Shidou's whole kit is very powerful, but it relies on air shots, so to really utilize it properly, you will need a reliable partner to feed you the air balls.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The director of Borderlands 3, Paul Sage, recently founded a new studio called Ruckus Games and began the production of its debut video game: an unnamed co-op third-person shooter that sounds both promising and ambitious.


In an interview with GamesRadar, Sage reflected on his career and talked about the trials & tribulations of working with AAA video game companies. One of the main points he made was about how studios care too much about the expectations of new entries in established franchises - which doesn't surprise us considering he worked on big IPs like Borderlands and The Elder Scrolls - and that they often play it too safe as a result of these precautions.

Greek Potatoes Disney Dreamlight Valley ingredients


To create Greek Potatoes, you'll first need the Storybook Vale DLC installed in Disney Dreamlight Valley as this recipe is exclusive to it. After getting started in this new region of the game, here are all of the ingredients you'll need:



Potato


Garlic


Any fruit


Any spice


Salt Crystal

To find a Potato, head to the Forgotten Lands in the original Valley. You can buy the seeds or perhaps even the ingredient itself from Goofy's Stall. The seeds themselves are 55 Star Coins each. 


Garlic can also be found in the original Valley. This time, fast travel over to the Forest of Valor. You'll find it growing within the ground. Look out for a large green stalk and pick it up amongst the grass.  Any fruit and any spice would match the next two ingredients. For example, you can grab some blueberries from the Forest of Valor and Oregano from the Plaza. 


The last ingredient Salt Crystal is from Everafter. Get your fishing rod and cast the rod in the water outside of the ripples. You can also make Aquatic Escargot with a Salt Crystal.


Once you have all of the ingredients, head back to any cooking station at your house or Chez Remy. Place all of them in the pot and them it will create the Greek Potatoes dish. You can sell it to Goofy's Stall for around 439 Star Coins (depending on the ingredients you choose) and eat it for 1,486 Energy.

        <updated>2024-12-02T19:12:16.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Wilfried Zaha Thunderstruck SBC is now live EA FC 25, and you can unlock a special card of the Ivory Coast attacker to solidify your Ultimate Team squad. 


Zaha is the latest entrant to the Thunderstruck promo, and all you've to do is complete the SBC and its tasks. Let's look at how you can complete the challenges, and if you should unlock this item (or save your resources). 


EA FC 25 Wilfried Zaha Thunderstruck SBC tasks


The Wilfried Zaha Thunderstruck SBC has three tasks, and here are the conditions.


Task 1 - Ligue 1



Min. 1 Players from: Ligue 1 McDonald's


Min. Team Rating: 84



Task 2 - 85-Rated Squad



Min. Team Rating: 85



Task 3 - 86-Rated Squad



Min. Team Rating: 86



EA FC 25 Wilfried Zaha Thunderstruck SBC solutions


Here's a set of solution you can use to complete the latest Thunderstruck 


Task 1 - Ligue 1



Any 9 84-rated items


Vitinha 85


Any 82-rated item



Task 2 - 85-Rated Squad



Vitinha 85


Alex Remiro 84


Oberdorf 86


Little 86


De Ligt 84


Raphinha 84


Guirassy 84


Gakpo 83


Benzema 86


Grealish 84


Casemiro 84



Task 3 - 86-Rated Squad



Catarina Macario 84


Lavelle 87


Raphinha 84


Prasnikar 84


Shaw 86


Swanson 87


Grealish 84


Remiro 84


Hasegawa 84


Gundogan 87


Popp 87



If you have a Ligue 1-based squad, this Zaha might be a worthwhile item to consider. He offers the Inside Forward++ at LM, which is a meta choice for any 442 formation. He's a bit short on playstyles, but the Quick Step+ is a great choice for attackers. Additionally, he also has 5* Skills, which is great if you know your way with the Right Stick. 


The card isn't a bad shot at all if you try to use cards that are highly agile. It's quite possible that Zaha will get both upgrades in the near future.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Matchday 2 of the FC Pro Open brings yet another Mystery Nation objective set in EA FC 25, and you can get some bonus rewards by performing a simple task. 


Usually, a nation is revealed on stream, and you'll have to complete the objective set using an item from the nation. Doing so will help you to win bonus packs, and you should make sure to get it while the Thunderstruck promo is live. That said, let's take a look at what this week's mystery nation is, and what you'll have to do in order to unlock the rewards. 


EA FC 25 Pro Open Matchday 2 Mystery Nation


Before going into the correct nation, let's take a look at the objective and its task. 


"Score three goals using a Finesse Shot with a player from the mystery nation in any UT game mode. The nation's name will be hinted at during the FC Pro Open Matchday 2 broadcast."


So far, only one clue has been handed out - someone from the nation has won the Ballon d'Or. This actually narrows the possible results a lot, and players have also made certain guesses. It's been already cleared that the nations are neither Poland nor Uruguay. 


Based on the stream's events, it seems likely that the nation is also from Europe. That said, the available choices are plenty, given that so many nations have been represented on the winner's pedestal at the Ballon d'Or ceremony. 


Upon further updates, it was confirmed that the nation is Croatia. You'll have to score three Finesse shot goals using a Croatian player item. You can score in any game mode of your choice, and the objective can be completed over multiple games. 


Once done, you'll be rewarded with a Premium Electrum Players Pack for your efforts.

I have never been more grateful for this recurrent Quixotic daydream's mass market failure than when watching trailers for Urge, an open world survival shooter that is both fuelled and plagued by piss.


"But hold your horses, young Edwin," you sternly interject. "I do not wish to hear about, let alone play an open world survival shooter that is both fuelled and plagued by piss, on a website that children might read. It sounds like a cheap, taboo-jabbing gimmick." Friend, I once thought as you. But then I did a little research, as is my journalistic responsibility, and it turns out Urge's notions about piss - bladdergold, as they call it in the West Country, or Crusoe Cola, as it's known in the States - are rather in-depth. I'm still very glad I can't smell the game, but I definitely have the urge to play it.

Usually, the process is chronological in nature, but there's a bit of turning back to a previous stage in one case. Let's take a look at how you can obtain all the Tusk evolutions to help it reach its maximum potential. 


A Universal Time (AUT) Tusk evolutions explained


The first evolution that you can obtain is available in Act 1, followed by Act 2. Then comes Act 3 and Act 4, but they are interconnected. Let's find out how you can obtain all of them.

If you enjoy racing around a large, oval track in fast cars, then you might want to grab one of the Nascar games on Switch before they vanish into thin air.
Yes, thanks to an announcement from Motorsport Games (cheers, Nintendo Everything), titles from the NASCAR Heat and NASCAR Rivals franchises will be delisted from the Switch eShop from 31st December 2024. No reasoning behind the delisting was mentioned in the announcement, but it's likely due to the transfer of the Nascar lisence from Motorsport Games to iRacing.

That will help you build up a decent squad and use your in-game resources to build characters with the best long-run potential.


Ash Echoes Tier list


Characters in Ash Echoes are of three types - DPS, Buffers, and Supports. Ideally, you'll want to have a well-balanced team, which is arguably more important than the tier list.

If, however, you’re hoping to switch to the 9800X3D from an older system with DDR4 RAM, you’ll need to upgrade that as well as the motherboard, as the entire Ryzen 9000 series only works with newer DDR5 memory.
Cyber Monday won’t help materialise more processors into retailers’ warehouses, but it can help you make this RAM switch on the cheap. Relatively speaking. And I can recommend a nice, fast 32GB kit of Corsair Vengeance DDR5, which is down by £43 in the UK and $22 in the US.

As well as fixing some smaller issues, patch 1.0.1 is said to remedy some of the game-breaking bugs that have beset the survival horror since its November 20 launch. GSC has also said that the patch fixes some balancing issues, including the nerfing of the infuriating Bloodsuckers.


A mixed launch


Stalker 2 has had a mixed launch. The title was first announced in 2010, following the launch of Call of Pripyat. However, GSC was shut down a year later before reopening to launch Cossacks 3 in 2014. In 2018, the team once again stated they were working on a Stalker sequel, titled Stalker 2: Heart of Chernobyl.

With each mech able to become another mech's worse nightmare, it becomes a game about stretching tight budgets to balance reactive counters with devastating offensives; about identifying the butterfly wings that can send tornados through your opponent’s ranks. It’s about the moments that eat up the hours like nothing else.

The developers of a heavily criticised mod for Half-Life 2 are intentionally blocking a small number of YouTubers from playing that mod, using Steam IDs to effectively blacklist and ban specific people from running it. Instead of launching the game as expected, these players will see the first-person shooter crash, alongside an error message that reads: "STOP talking SH1T about us". This is an act of revenge for previous criticism of the mod, say the affected videofolks, who are described in the mod's code as "anticitizens".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Double trouble.
The Life is Strange series has been an interesting diversion from Square Enix’s typical MO of putting out endless takes on RPGs, instead offering heavily narrative-focused stories exploring the trials of various people who develop supernatural abilities. This series' strong storytelling has garnered a loyal fanbase, it’s also proven to be a bit uneven along the way.
The original Life is Strange followed the adventures of a time-bending teen named Max Caulfield, and its ending (whichever one you picked) was considered by its creators Dontnod to be the definitive end of Max’s story, as Life is Strange was intended to be a sort of anthology series and Dontnod introduced a new protagonist in Life is Strange 2. With development duties having shifted to Deck Nine, however, a direct sequel has now been produced that continues the story of an older Max who now lives in another part of the country. Despite its divisive premise, Life is Strange: Double Exposure does a solid job of exploring Max’s character further while introducing a new and interesting supporting cast, though it unfortunately feels like a clumsy fit for the Switch’s limited hardware.

Yuck. If there’s one type of design that deserves the accolade, though, it’s RPGs that are assured enough in the richness of their worlds to not feel the need to signpost every discovery.
It’s a feedback loop of charitable feelings: the game is saying "we think you’re smart enough to find this stuff on your own". "You’re right!" you respond. "I am smart! And anyone who recognises that must be one smart cookie". Joy abounds, it rains Tunnock’s Caramel Wafers, hedgehogs jig gracefully in the street, and all is right with the world. So, I must say, I’m quite pleased to hear Avowed’s environment region director Berto Ritger sing the virtues of missable content to GamesRadar.

Glancing over that map as a newcomer to the game, my eye was caught by the creator's casual mention that Caves Of Qud is technically 2,147,483,646 levels deep.
"Is Caves Of Qud really 2,147,483,646 levels deep?" I asked Brendy, like a wide-eyed child asking whether there is such a thing as dog heaven. Brendy wasn't sure. (About Caves Of Qud, I mean, not dog heaven.) So I put the question to one of the developers, Freehold Games co-founder Brian Bucklew. In brief, the answer is yes, but with some significant caveats.

Visions of Mana director Ryosuke Yoshida has announced that he left the NetEase-owned Ouka Studios at the end of October and has since taken up a position at Square Enix.

It has been out for a little over two years now, but if you finally decided that now's the time to pick up 2022's tactical delight, TRIANGLE STRATEGY, then you're out of luck — at least, you are if you wanted to download it on Switch — because the game has been delisted from the eShop.
Yes, those who have yet to download Triangle Strategy will see that the eShop listing is currently unavailable. The page itself is still there, naturally, but there's no option to digitally purchase it through Nintendo.

Some NPCs wouldn’t be swayed by this, but some would lower their weapons at the offer of a prawn cocktail treat, and so you’d be constantly playing chicken with various guards: edging closer toward them, your shaking hands rattling the delicious disks inside the oily packet, mentally weighing up whether it's worth risking them turning hostile at the last second.
Obviously, I’d scan some real crisp packets and just alter the logos for maximum immersion.

Just an endless cycle of microSD cards, mice, microSD cards, mice. At least it’s a good'un, though - the best Steam Deck-compatible microSD of them all, in fact. Previously, its one weakness was the lack of a truly cavernous 1TB model, but that was amended earlier this year, and now that capacity is getting its first major saving as part of Black Friday 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cyber Knights Colon Flashpoint does not lead with its best foot. This is easier to shrug off while it's still in early access, but I will confess some relief when I read that the Trese Brothers (It's pronounced "Trese") nudged their estimated release date back to 2025. It needs a bit longer. But I'm about ready to start recommending it.
I'm a tad biased by my love for their previous Star Traders Colon Frontiers, an interest in mercenary management, and a wish for more turn-based tactics games that aren't bloody XCOM again. That I have reservations about what CKF hasn't yet nailed down is in part a symptom of high expectations. And because despite carrying over some design ethos from Frontiers, Cyber Knights is a very different kind of game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back when Digital Extremes were largely known for collaborating with Epic Games on the Unreal Tournament series, they made a little game called Dark Sector. Released in 2008, it's part of the fine tradition of post-Gears double-A actioners that basically consist of taking a gruff man, throwing him into a world of grit, gravel and burning oil drums, and handing him a murderous gimmick. Dark Sector's gimmick was the glaive, a pointy boomerang you could use to scoop up objects, solve puzzles, and kill stuff in third-person view.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To be clear, I still think the best graphics card deal of Black Friday week is that RTX 4070 Super offer and oh no wait that one’s gone now. But even if hadn’t been ecommerced to death, there’d still be a way to get the upgraded ray tracing and DLSS 3 frame gen tools of the RTX 40 series for less cash still: plucky 1080p contender, the RTX 4060, whose deals are still very much available and kicking.
In the UK, the best available prices are for the MSI GeForce RTX Ventus 2X Black edition, which is the partner card I happen to own myself – and has become the effective go-to GPU for RPS game performance tests. Over in the US, meanwhile, the Gigabyte GeForce RTX 4060 Gaming OC is the most affordable of all; it’s a chunkier design than that of the compact Ventus 2X, though that’s mainly just the tradeoff for having an extra fan. These cards were already on the cheaper end of the RTX 4060 spectrum, and now they’re £30 / $35 off in the sales. Bargain.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As far as Black Friday deals go, the Logitech G502 Hero isn’t so much low-hanging fruit as it is a root vegetable. Every year, this damned multi-buttoned mouse goes on sale, and every year, I’m powerless to avoid writing about it. Can’t even be bothered to take a different header image photo. It’s partly your fault, you know. You like it too much.
This time it’s down from £80 to £26 in the UK (£27 outside the Bezos Empire), which isn’t quite an all-time low, but is pretty close – and a silly-good price for such a capable mouse in any case. Its US discount price of $35 ain’t half bad either, though I notice Amazon US is shouting louder about knocking the newer G502 X down from $80 for $45. That’s mostly a fine mouse as well, though I find its redesigned scroll wheel a bit too much on scratchy side. Of the two, I’d stick with the classic.

The first-person shooter, which is replete with satisfying explosions, gunfire, bullet ricochets, smashing glass, sparks, goo, blood spatters, dust, ice particles, smoke, flecks of plaster, and bad guys yelling at one another about how she's over there, may be described as noisy, both in the aural and visual sense of the word. Which is how we like it, you understand. This latest update to the early access shooter leans into that by layering on even more juicy shootFX. It also adds a whole new game mode and plenty of other tweaks. The bad news is that some story bits are now delayed.

Doubly so in the wake of The Callisto Protocol - a game I still think is worth picking up on a deep discount, if you like hitting gross things with a big bit of metal. It’s quite exciting, then, to learn that the next game from Lies Of P developer Round 8 Studios might just replace that severed limb. Alongside a sequel to the puppety soulslike, they’re also working on a sci-fi survival horror game, via Eurogamer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In many ways, the SteelSeries Apex 3 TKL and Apex Pro TKL are about as different as tenkeyless gaming keyboards get: the first is a budget-friendly membrane ‘board, the second a luxurious all-mechanical number with adjustable switches and its own little OLED display. Yet they’re also both very good at what they do, and are now sharing Black Friday discount honours.

Rather than do the usual routine of just suggesting the WD Black SN850X again, however, there’s no better SSD-for-yer-money deal right now than the Crucial T500, which is going for an exceptionally low £58 right now for the 1TB capacity – down from £120. The 2TB version is also an excellent buy at £100, and there are decent offers up for grabs in the US too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Okay okay, just one more handheld deal then I’ll look at some desktop stuff. But here’s a properly chunky Black Friday discount on the most endearingly out-there Steam Deck rival to date, the Lenovo Legion Go: the 512GB model has shed hundreds of pounds/dollaridoos to fall all the way to £479 / $500. That’s really not a lot for something that goes full luxe on its display and build quality, not to mention its party trick of letting the two controller sections split off, Nintendo-switch style, with one acting as a portable mouse.
This is also the cheapest that the Legion Go has ever gone, at least in the UK, so could make a good pickup if you’ve been wanting something with more power than the Steam Deck range but have been put off by the Legion Go or Asus ROG Ally X’s high launch pricing.

It's small in scope, for one, but also VR would let you see through the eyes of the tooter and slide your trombone note up and down by holding the motion controllers up to your face.

Discounts are definitely never a bad thing, but Steam sales used to feel like big events on the PC gaming calendar. They don't anymore, to me. Friends, are Steam sales still exciting to you?

I am Bohdan Beastmaster, aspiring wrangler of all the radiation-twisted insults to God that occupy the Zone. One of its rogue Artifacts exploded my flat, and rather than find a place on SpareRoom, I’ve gone for the easier and safer option of venturing into the wilds of Chornobyl – armed not with rusty AKs or scavenged grenades but the teeth and claws of my mutant soon-to-be companions. The absence of any actual fauna-influencing tools or techniques only makes my plan even simpler: find beasts, aggro beasts onto human enemies, win.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The genre of 'Action RPG' is supremely annoying to write about, because the term can mean different things to different people, but here’s how I see it: Diablo 4 and similar games, such as Path Of Exile, are 'ARPGs'. Which stands for 'Action RPG'. But Zelda games are 'Action RPGs', which is a totally different genre that you could, if you felt like it, also shorten to 'ARPG'. So, to summarise: ARPGs and ARPGs are two different things, and both are Action RPGs. Got it? Great.
It’s because of this kerfuffle that I’m not exactly mad at Diablo boss Rod Fergusson recently suggesting that we just call games that are similar to Diablo 'Diablo-likes'. I just find it very funny that he’s the one saying it, in a bold faced act of admittedly very inconsequential linguistic colonialism that carries the unspoken connotation that something is "like the game I make, but a bit crap".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in January I wrote a (supporters only) post about how tired I am of all survival games starting off the same. Here's the gist of it: I've had enough of gathering rocks and sticks to make a crafting bench, from which I'm forced to build a hut and so on. I'm sure for some this is riveting, but for me, it's something I tire of within seconds.
And so it's with a heavy heart I say that Towers Of Aghasba suffers from the same starting gamut of sticks and stones. There's a hint of some interesting ecosystem stuff springing up a bit later, and judging by the trailers, an ability to clamber on massive flying creatures made of what looks like elephant skin and hair. Still, I just can't do it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've gone on record as not being a huge fan of the artstyle choices used in the new Warcraft I & II remasters. It's crisp and readable, sure, but I'm never exactly thrilled to see all the roughness of older sprites completely done away with, especially when I always felt some of that ruggedness was the point. The tendency of remasters to treat every characterful oddity as a blemish is a wider topic than the scope of this article, but one day, Bluepoint will remaster Bloodborne, and the world will feel my pain. 
Anyway. Nowadays, I'd say Blizzard - or, World Of Warcraft, at least - is pretty much synomous with a softer, more colorful approach to fantasy worlds. While I don't pine for a return to the more boobily ridiculous elements of Frank Frazetta's style, I do often wish that some of the more expressive, pained, and physically grounded elements of classic Sword And Sorcery art was a bit more common. I'm no art scholar, and there's undoubtedly a bit of tunnel vision of my part to this assertion, but as far as as pop culture goes: I see the Blizzard version of fantasy more than I see the Frazetta version, and I don't exactly love it. Same goes for the older, punkier, less uniform sci-fi art from things like 2000 AD and Warhammer 40,000. Edwin touched on some of this in his excellent Space Marine piece. 
Anyway, a valued RPS community member on the Discord shared an older bit of art by Blizzard's Chris Metzen, from the original Starcraft manual. I figured a few of you might enjoy seeing these older pieces, considering how much the overall look of their games has changed over the years.

Your job is to enter and inspect them in first-person. What are you inspecting them for? Ghosts.

I might be conflating billionaires here.
Also, coincidentally, all things you can do in the demo for Beff Jezos Simulator. Now, work simulation games aren’t my absolute favourite. But, hey, I do love a good fantasy game.

CEO Swen Vincke did, however, caveat that while the overall level of post-release support would be "diminished", there would be a few more updates. We interpreted that to mean bug fixes and the like. Certainly, I wasn't expecting brand new subclasses for every class in the game, which is what you'll get with the just-announced Baldur's Gate 3 patch 8, together with new crossplay functionality and a full-figured photo mode.

That game began as a PICO-8 prototype by designer Jakub Wasilewski before being polished to a fine shine in its full release.

All of which is just lead-in to talking about Solitomb, a solitaire-based dungeon crawler in which you fight demons by building hands of playing cards. It's currently - heywaitaminute - a pay-what-you-want PICO-8 prototype by designer Jakub Wasilewski where "all money earned goes towards making the bigger version possible." Like Slipways, it already seems like a frightfully clever piece of design.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have one urgent request for Starward Industries, creators of the just-announced “anti-combat” survival RPG Dante’s Ring – don’t use the phrase “ring of fire” in your English marketing materials. I get that you’re going for a cocktail of Divina Commedia and FromSoftware associations, but you have to remember that this is the internet and we're all desperately crude. I can’t speak for people from other English-language countries, but when I hear somebody talking about their "ring of fire", I tend to assume they’ve been at the vindaloo.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[System requirements are on the rise, and a glut of recent PC facepunchers has left some of the RPS treehouse wondering if it’s time for a graphics card upgrade. Being a helpful colleague and a handsome friend, I dutifully informed them that the highly capable Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 Super is currently getting the Black Friday price cut treatment, with Zotac’s Twin Edge model dropping especially low in both the UK and US. Still, dear readers, if you feel like punishing us for that comment system switch, you could always head over to Amazon and buy up all the stock yourself.
$590 is a decent deal for a model that’s spent most of the past few months at $610, but us Brits are getting the better bargain here - even if it’s not for the OC version. £500 means a hefty £49 slasheroo, the deepest discount this card has seen yet, and you’ll also get a key for Indiana Jones and the Great Circle to play when it releases on December 9th.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's often claimed by liars and fools that our website's title is a clever reference to the ancient Chinese game of shoushiling - or "rock paper scissors", as it's known overseas. The orthodox interpretation is that "Rock Paper Shotgun" is a folksy regional variation on this, with a "shotgun" instead of the "scissors". But friends, this is patently absurd. Think about it: a game that pits a shotgun against a rock or piece of paper would be incredibly one-sided. It goes against reason!
The sad reality is that the origins of our website's title have been deliberately obscured, allowing cold hard fact to slither back into legend. Behind that mockingly nonsensical moniker sleeps an eldritch truth of such gravity it would make Gandalf spill his mead. Friends, the Rock Paper Shotgun is real. The Weapon exists. Or at least, it once did - and will, for I mean to fashion it anew by combing the writing of RPS writers gone by for raw materials. And in this endeavour, I will naturally need your aid.

While the announcement makes mention of continuing on with a new funding partner, laid-off staff are describing it as a studio closure.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In hindsight, it’s surprising that it took so long for hardware manufacturers to start making "gaming" earbuds. If the likes of chairs, glasses, and chewing gum can be painted stealth-bomber black and prefixed with the G word, why not something that can actually get off its harshly angled bum and help pipe the games themselves into your head?
Then again, maybe gaming earbuds were just waiting for their moment. Obviously the Nintendo Switch is the Nintendo Switch, but the rise of handhelds like the Steam Deck and Asus ROG Ally has driven desires for more portable (yet games-friendly) noise-deliverers 'round these PC parts as well. Thus, for another edition of Should You Bother With – the RPS column where a diaphragm of testing vibrates advice directly into the cochlea of understanding – let’s have a listen of these wireless buds and find out whether they’re a worthy replacement for your current go-to headphones.

Here's a creepy good 'un: "'Please, God, don't let it look in the closet,’ I silently prayed. 'Please, God, don't let it look in the closet,' it parroted back from the next room." You can't do that with baby shoes, you anonymous hack!
Silent Hill 2 remake’s senior narrative designer Barbara Kciuk reckons this principle extends to much bigger productions. "It is a bit niche, but actually, the interesting part about horror is that it is one of the best ratios when it comes to the cost of production and the earnings," she recently told TheGamer’s Rhiannon Bevan.

Sometimes, I worry that the association of PS1 with moody, Silent Hillian dankness has gotten to the point that younger players no longer perceive the original PS1 as a video game console at all.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sometimes a home only becomes a home when you leave. I recently moved out from a London flat I'd rented for over a decade, for instance, and this has properly done a number on me. Being given my notice transformed the place from a transient pile of cadaverous lino and spasmodic plumbing into something mythical and unnerving – a whole chapter of my life completed and reduced to a piece of masonry in the rearview mirror, a relic I had been living in for years without quite realising.
A few video game developers have investigated emotions like these by recreating their current and prior homes as virtual environments: places of mingled memory and invention, expressive of both nostalgia and surprise. At this year's Game Developer Conference in San Francisco, I interviewed a couple of teams who are coming at this premise with very different objectives, and somehow, meeting in the middle. One of the games in question is a work of daydreaming fondness, the other of comical anger. Both find a focus in the figure of a matriarch who is kindly in one game, abusive in the other.

When did its non-descript, black hooded protagonist first wriggle, with the transgressive delight of an unbidden slug between naked toes embarking on a 2am fridge odyssey, into the as yet uncolonised crevices of my ‘demos’ library? The specifics, I fear, are but the fumes of memories, lingering like armies of mice in trenchcoats at supermarket cheese sample platters, at once painfully obvious and immune to detection in their uncanny shroud of stifling human decorum. "For who is madder?!" I shout, in a normal and cool manner. "The mice - so very mad for cheese - or the madmen who screams ‘Mice! Mice!’ in the middle of the cheese aisle?!"
And if I can’t remember how it got here, how can I make it go away?

Humanoid Origin posted the announcement of the studio's closure on LinkedIn yesterday, saying that a "shortfall of funding" was responsible for the decision. They had been making a "multi-platform AAA game, focusing on character-driven narrative in an all-new science-fiction universe", according to the studio's website.

Down is where much of the Badness in the world is traditionally located, after all, whether you're talking about geology or psychology or theology. White Knuckle reverses the flow. You are already Down; by extrapolation, you must now go Up.
Possibly, you are Down because you are a manifestation of the aforementioned Badness. Possibly, the monstrous things trying to thwart your ascent are merely trying to stop you contaminating the surface world. Possibly, they are the Real Heroes. It doesn't really matter, because you don't have a choice. There is a wall of unspeakable flesh coming up the tunnel behind you. To avoid becoming part of it, you must climb.

"I won’t", I reply in sing-song while quietly adding pictures of the JSAUX ModCase to the CMS. That’s right, Amazon and a bunch of other retails have launched their BF sales a week early, which is annoying, unless you’re in the market for a Steam Deck case upgrade. If so, consider the compact, multifunctional ModCase, which is down to just £24 / $24. That makes for savings of 33% and 20% respectively, on what was already a nicely affordable alternative to the luxury of Dbrand’s similar Project Killswitch.

Far from being a premeditated ambush by intelligent AI-controlled soldiers, this is just a result of the game's janky spawns. Those botched encounters are unlike previous games, where roaming bands of factional murderfolk would patrol the radioactive wastes, seemingly according to their own whims. Back in the day, this wandering baddies feature was dubbed "A-life" by developers GSC Game World - basically a jargon word for the simulation of enemies that would lead to "emergent" moments of violence and conflict. It was promised as a feature in Stalker 2 but many players have noticed it seems to be absent. Over the weekend, GSC insisted the simulation is technically present in the sequel. It's just broken.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you’re a fan of Warhammer 40k, you know John Blanche. Even if it’s you’re first time hearing his name, you’ll be familiar with his fingerprints on some of the setting’s most defining artwork. He’s responsible for that iconic imagine of the emprah - the one the best shows off the dark irony of a such a wretched figure becoming an idol of worship. While the term ‘grimdark’ originates from 40k’s "in the grim darkness of the far future…" tagline, grimdark as an aesthetic is one Blanche pioneered. There’s even a style of miniature painting - Blanchitsu - named after him.
Basically, even games that don’t use the 40k license owe an incredible amount to Blanche’s work. That’s not to mention his influence on the fantasy setting of the Total War: Warhammer series either. His piece Harry The Hammer was the cover for the first edition of Fantasy Battle - recently added to the strategy game as chaos hero Harold Hammerstorm. I could go on, and I might do so in a bit, but here’s the news: Trademark Films are making a documentary on Blanche’s work, starring Napoleon Dynamite actor Jon Heder. It’s called The Grim And The Dark: The Search For John Blanche, and it’s out next Spring. Here’s a trailer:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the most enduring online movie scams involves sites that claim to offer premium content, but turn out to be some type of scam. These services do not discriminate, so whether 'customers' are pirates or just regular people hoping to buy content, everyone is a potential victim. The scam has been running for at least 20 years yet, seemingly out of nowhere, pro site-blocking studies now describe it as a major piracy-related security threat.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We've been working for a while on the next ScummVM release, and it is time for a call for public testing.
Support for a number of new engines and games for the existing ones was added, and we need your special attention to the following titles:
Orion Burger.
Total Eclipse and Total Eclipse 2.
Thimbleweed Park.
The Space Bar.
Moonbase Commander. (with multiplayer support)
Backyard Basketball.
Unrest.
Rise of the Dragon.
Castle Master.
Wait for it! Issue 3. Song for a Hare. (Ну, погоди! Выпуск 3. Песня для зайца)
Mask Show. (Маски-шоу)

A detailed list of all exciting new features and fixes is available in our NEWS file.
We are looking forward to your reports about successful and unsuccessful playthroughs and bugs reported!

Determined to right this most heinous of wrongs, and armed with the conviction that no subjectivity be allowed to exist on the internet without at least one supplementary article of caveats, we’ve all put forth a single game that absolutely should have made the list. Consider the matter closed, then, at least until we all realise we’d actually like to do a 102nd pick each.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Helldivers 2 developers Arrowhead have been voluble lately about potentially adding elements from other sci-fi worlds to the shooter, with chief creative officer Johan Pilestedt rubbing his hands gleefully at the prospect of partnerships with Warhammer, Alien, the Fifth Element, and more besides. Speaking at the G-STAR Conference in Busan earlier this month, recently appointed chief executive officer Shams Jorjani confirmed that Arrowhead are looking into such collaborations, giving the example of refitting your dropship to look like one of Halo's Pelicans, or introducing the Zerg from Blizzard's Starcraft as an enemy faction. 
Jorjani cautioned listeners, however, that these injections of third-party DNA need to look and feel appropriate to the setting. After all, if you start fecklessly chucking the Zerg, Chaos Space Marines or Fifth Element's, er, flying taxis into Helldivers 2, it might spoil the meticulous coherency of a game in which saluting protects you against lethal falls and some guy called Joel is running the universe. The funny part is that according to Jorjani, Arrowhead once envisaged a system that would get round the problem of inconsistency by essentially making third-party cosmetics, including whole map skins, visible only to players who have them enabled. To put that another way, Arrowhead once envisaged a system in which individual Helldivers would hallucinate other licenses.

It can take entire clips of ammo to take down some of these tough beasts, and you get nothing back for killing this wildlife except the hollow satisfaction of pest control. Alongside the bugs and performance issues, it's a common enough complaint to players of the first-person survival shooter that it's already been addressed by a modder, who has created a tweak to lower the health of various dogs, boars, and bloodsuckers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Long before Hideo Kojima made the first triple-A walking simulator, he was trying to spin sunlight into bullets. The game in question, Boktai: The Sun Is In Your Hand, is a Game Boy Advance title from 2003, in which you play a vampire-slaying gunslinger. The gun you're slinging is a "solar-powered" pistol, which you could charge up using a cartridge-mounted photometric sensor by physically standing in sunshine. This was 13 years before the launch of Pokemon Go. Sadly, Boktai's debut didn't result in city parks or rooftops being flooded by crowds of GBA-wielding undead killers. But it was a fun gimmick and the game itself is good enough to carry it - an isometric dungeon-crawler in which you have to find a vamp's coffin and drag it to the surface for purgation.

This upsets me slightly, because I find Rockstar’s constant self-assured bloviating to be quite irritating, even though I’m sure I’ll play their game for a billion hours. What Vivat Slovakia is, then, is a very ambitious homage to the Grand Theft Auto series that isn’t shy about it, right down to the font choices. I’m not sure if you should play it, but I do feel enriched for learning of its existence. Here’s a trailer.

It tells me exactly what I need to do before I even boot up the game, which is otherwise powerfully weird-looking. The cover art is reminiscent of a children's book, if it were for adults. Or a lost episode of Ed Edd and Eddy, where a fourth older sibling (Eddie) acts on his murderous intent and engages in some slick FPSing. Either way, there's a demo out on Steam and despite being very short and limited, I am excited for its future.

Here’s some more delicious bait for you, then. Mossflower TW is a campaign mod for Medieval II: Total War expansion Kingdoms that lets ranks of mace-wielding mice, helmeted hedgehogs, and ornery otters skitter wildly all over the venerable strategy game. It’s been about since Summer, and the team have been working on patching since. It seems very playable, if the footage of people playing it is anything to go by. Here’s a video by YouTuber Tharshey so you can see it in action:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Assassin's Creed Shadows is making changes to how it handles stealth, versus other games in the long-running series. Gone is the companion eagle who can spot enemies for you, for a start; instead, players can hide in the - hey - shadows, lie on their tummies for the first time, and make use of a "shinobi and assassin arsenal" of smoke bombs and bells.

There are old moves that are coming back after an absence, too: Shadows will allow for 'double assassinations' again.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Star Wars Outlaws' stealth has been much debated, though not hotly. Some people think it's rubbish, some others think it's basically fine. Ubisoft themselves seem to think it's one of the key issues with the game, with the creative director previously saying the forced stealth sections are "incredibly punishing".

Now there's a new patch, apparently Outlaws' biggest yet, and stealth and combat are firmly in the crosshairs. The AI and player detection has changed; you can now choose combat in areas where it was previously not allowed; and enemies have had weak points added, for those who wish to cause massive damage.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl stays largely faithful to the original series’ bleak yet inquisitive tone and propensity for technical problems, but there’s another, much smaller feature that it also brings back: silly titles for its lesser NPCs. All the major and side characters are, indeed, characters, but rather than leave inconsequential henchmen and roving bandits nameless, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 assigns Zone-merc handles to each and every one of them. Some try to sound badass, some might as well have been chosen by the owner panickedly looking around the room for something to name himself after, and all of them sound like they should be on the actor's wall in Toast of London.
Because your life partly depends on relieving slain foes of their belongings, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 encourages you to get up close and looty with these blokes, meaning you end up spending a lot of time reading goofy nicknames. I thought I’d pay tribute to the best ones I’ve seen so far, even if the majority of these honours will need to be given posthumously.

The challenge was to develop a solution to prevent non-approved 'pirate' set-top devices from functioning in people's homes.

Once implemented, "there will be a general failure in most of the irregular boxes in use," the hacker predicted.

Debutující scenárista a režisér Vojtěch Strakatý nám přináší drama děvčete, které netuší, co si počít.


Existuje vícero českých filmů, které surfují na oblíbené vlně "zakažte exekutory, zrušte dluhy, je to nelidské!" (například Tancuj Matyldo). After Party takovým filmem není. Exekutoři se v něm chovají korektně a slušně a vinu na situaci celé rodiny nese naprosto jednoznačně otec, který neopatrně investoval, i když nevíme jak.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Castle Master, the haunting conclusion to the Freescape engine saga, is now ready for public testing!
Prepare yourself for a perilous adventure as you lower the drawbridge to enter the Castle Master’s domain. Released in 1990 by Incentive Software, Castle Master became popular for its technical innovation and challenging gameplay. The game inspired countless 3D adventure titles, and the Freescape engine itself marked a technological milestone, enabling groundbreaking object interaction and spatial puzzles.
Notably, Castle Master was one of the first games to let you choose to play as either a prince or a princess, offering a different experience depending on your choice.
Your mission: rescue your twin, imprisoned within the eerie depths of Castle Eternity by the evil Magister. This sprawling, foreboding castle is filled with traps, monsters, and puzzles blocking your path. Gather items, unlock doors, and solve complex riddles as you navigate the labyrinthine halls and confront the dark forces within.
This modern reimplementation showcases enhanced graphics using OpenGL, with initial support for the DOS and ZX Spectrum releases. If you’re eager to embark on this dark journey, a playable demo is available to test your tenacity.
To participate in the testing, ensure you have a daily development build. We encourage all players to submit feedback and bug reports through our issue tracker.
Will you brave the creepy corridors of Castle Eternity and free your sibling, or will you fall victim to the Magister’s curse and join his army of enslaved spirits? The adventure awaits!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After seven months of intense work, we are ready to announce support for a few games based on qdEngine, developed by K-D Labs.
The work is based on the original sources published now under GPL, although the work started a bit earlier than that. The engine supports 14 games, five of which we are announcing support for. Most of these games were released in Russian; however, there were Lithuanian, Czech, and Polish releases. The support is announced for:
Wait for it! Issue 3. Song for a Hare, (Russian: Ну, погоди! Выпуск 3. Песня для зайца, Lithuanian: Na, palauk! Zuikio dainos, Czech: Jen počkej a Píseň pro zajíce)
Mask Show (Russian: Маски-шоу)
Marvellous Mice Adventures: Meeting Sea Rat (Russian: Три маленькие белые мышки. Визит Морской крысы, Czech: Příběhy myší rodinky I, Polish: Były Sobie Myszki Trzy: Na Spotkanie Cioci Myszy)
The Adventures of the Good Soldier Schweik (Russian: Похождения бравого солдата Швейка)
Marvellous Mice Adventures: Sea Rat's Birthday, (Russian: Три маленькие белые мышки. День рождения морской крысы, Polish: Były Sobie Myszki Trzy: Urodzinowe Śledztwo)
Other games do work; however, we haven’t playtested them. You may find more information on our Wiki. Also, we are looking for the Lithuanian version of Little Longnose and Polish releases of Little Mice games and Wait for it! game. If you happen to have a copy, please contact sev.
We continue the active development so that support for other games will follow shortly. The primary constraint is playtesting.
To run these games, you need the latest daily build of ScummVM. If you encounter any hiccups during your quests, please file them on our issue tracker.
