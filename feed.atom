        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you're someone who intends to spend plenty of hours with EA FC 25's Manager Mode, this list could be of immense interest.


EA Sports has revealed plenty of ratings so far, and this includes a lot of hidden gems you could try to sign. These 20 players have the highest growth potential inside the game. In simple words, these footballers all begin as Bronze cards when you start a new career but their overall ratings could increase the most if developed properly. They might not have the highest potential ratings, but the difference between their starting and final overalls will be the highest at launch.


Complete list of top 20 hidden gems in EA FC 25 Manager 


Here's the full list of the 20 players, along with their starting and potential overall ratings.

As the starting overalls of all these players are low, you should be able to sign them for cheap. It gets even easier if you're a big club and have high amounts of starting funds. But just signing them won't be enough - you'll need to develop them over time.


Once again, remember that these are footballers with the highest growth potential and not the ones with the highest potential overalls. We will have that list ready once EA FC 25 is live on early access across all available platforms.

It became an obsession for some in the two weeks the website was online, as players fought to fill all the boxes, or undo the work of their peers.

The fight was far more complicated than it seemed, as the developer recently explained, with some players finding ways to encode hidden messages in the checkboxes.

The world is inspired by Italian folklore, from the weather and buildings to the vibrant masks that are a core part of the gameplay, and you can play it very soon. 


The release date for Enotria: The Last Song has changed several times as the developer has hit milestones early and wanted to get the game out into the hands of fans. I think the launch of Elden Ring's Shadow of the Erdtree DLC also caused at least one push. Now, though, we have a firm date and set of times for when everybody will be able to get their hands on it.

His shot animations are probably the best in my books for my 3-way scorer C build.

This build by Cinco Gaming is extremely promising, and I have been spending plenty of hours with it.

This particular build focuses on the shooting ability of Durant in real-life. That's one of the main reasons behind having a wingspan of just 6'11 with a height of 6'10. Having that wingspan will allow you to have better stats in the shooting department.

Cole Palmer has managed to get the biggest raise in overalls. From a mere 66-rated Silver common in EA FC 24, he will be Rare Gold in EA FC 25. His stunning first season at Chelsea contributed to his meteoric rise.


Both Mainoo and Wharton are two talented English midfielders who are getting all the plaudits from the fans, thanks to their exploits in the Premier League. Their base cards would be potential candidates for Premier League-based starter squads.


The forward duo of Gyokeres and Dobvyk has had splendid form in front of the goal and raised their overall ratings. It's great to see the footballers being rewarded for their real-life performances with big stat boosts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[New ratings for EA FC 25 continue to be released, and the list of top 10 U-21 talents has been revealed.


These talented footballers will be high on the list of many gamers. Some of them will have high potential ratings, and they could be attractive propositions for those who love the Career Mode. Few already have high current overall ratings, with Real Madrid's Jude Bellingham being on top. Let's take a look at the full list to find out who has made it to the top 10.


Complete list of 10 best U-21 players in EA FC 25


Let's first take a look at the top 10 and their overall ratings.



Jude Bellingham CAM 90


Florian Wirtz CAM 88


Jamal Musiala CAM 87


Savinho LW 82


Destiny Udogie LB 82


Lamine Yamal RW 81


Alex Balde LB 81


Melo Gusto RB 80


Benjamin Sesko ST 79


Antonio Silva CB 79



Jude Bellingham has received a massive boost in EA FC 25 following a successful year at Real Madrid. While he was good in EA FC 24, the 90-rated item will be a favorite of many to build their Ultimate Team. The German duo of Jamal Musiala and Florian Wirtz follows him. Wirtz and Musiala have also improved their overall ratings compared to FC 24.


Destiny Udogie and Savio could be good choices for those who choose to build Premier League-based squads in the Premier League. The 82-rated duo would undoubtedly feature in many starter squads. The Barca duo of Balde and Yamal will be great fits for LaLiga fans.


Benjami Sesko and Antonio Silva's base items might not appear attractive, but they could be well-served by promo cards in the future. You could also try to lure them to your club in Career Mode, but a hefty transfer fee might have to be paid.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft has announced that filming on the first-ever Watch Dogs movie has now finished. This means that from here the team will be editing and working on the final cut that should make it into cinemas and onto streaming services. 


However, the thing that's taken most people by surprise with this announcement is that there's a Watch Dogs movie in the works at all. The plot has been kept a closely guarded secret ever since the idea of making the movie was approved, and nothing has leaked since filming began earlier this year. I've always loved the Watch Dogs universe, but it's hard to believe that Ubisoft is investing in a movie when it seems to care very little about the games after launching Watch Dogs: Legion.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The official website for Ron Kamonohashi's Forbidden Deductions has just unveiled the main promotional video for the show's highly anticipated second season. The trailer gives fans a glimpse of the exciting new season set to premiere on October 7, 2024.


In addition to the familiar characters, the trailer introduces the season's opening theme song, “Feedback o Narashite” (Playing Feedback), performed by the Japanese rock band Humbreaders. Fans can also look forward to the ending theme, "Labyrinth," performed by the band hockrockb.




According to Anime News Network, Season 2 will see the return of Yohei Azakami as the voice of Ron Kamonohashi, while Yoshitsugu Matsuoka reprises his role as the antagonist, Mylo Moriarty. Returning staff members include Shota Ihata, who is the director at studio Diomedéa, and Wataru Watari, who oversees the series composition. Masakazu Ishikawa continues to handle character design, and Yo Tsuji returns to compose the soundtrack.


The first season of the anime aired from October to December 2023, with 13 episodes. The first season is available on Crunchyroll.


Ron Kamonohashi's Forbidden Deductions is based on Akira Amano’s manga of the same name. It follows the adventures of the eccentric detective Ron Kamonohashi and his good-natured but somewhat clueless partner, police detective Totomaru Ishiki. Together, they solved challenging mysteries, bringing hidden truths to light. The English translation of the manga can be read on MANGA Plus.

There are countless books about first love out there, and they all come with their own heartwarming moments, as well as a whole heap of relatable moments. Over my many years, I’ve come across some books which stand out for their storytelling, or how long their lessons remain with you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Marvel vs Capcom Fighting Collection was only released on September 12, but the legend of a player called the "Wazzler" is already spreading. 


According to Steam reviews, this guy is like Thanos; running into him on ranked is inevitable. The unholy beatdowns he delivers are, too. It all makes perfect sense, though, because the Wazzler is none other than Justin Wong, 9-time EVO champion and the greatest Marvel vs Capcom player of all time. 


Getting bulled in a fighting game by Wong is nothing new. For example, a clip of him showing an eight-year-old the ropes in Mortal Kombat X has made its rounds on the internet for years. But Marvel vs Capcom is Justin's specialty, and this time, it's adults quitting the game in frustration.


The first mention of the Wazzler comes from Steam user "TongOfDmg," who claimed that their run-in not only ruined his night but drove him to refund the game. Meanwhile, several other users have left reviews warning of the impending danger of Wazzler and the dire consequences of his wrath. 




But maybe they've got Justin all wrong. Maybe, in a twisted way, his reign of terror is for the benefit of mankind. I mean, Steam user "formerly" said they made their entire family dinner while locked in an Iron Man combo. And anyone who brings family together like that is alright in my book.





Justin himself seems to be having fun with the situation and acknowledged it on his Twitter. But what he said next might shake Marvel players to their core. After reaching the number one rank on the Steam and PlayStation 4 ladders, he announced the Nintendo Switch would be next. 


It appears no platform is safe from his expanding empire, and I worry for myself and other Xbox players when the MvC collection comes to Xbox One next year. The only certainty is that if you dare go online with the Marvel vs Capcom Fighting Collection, you must beware Wazzler.

Sometimes, looking back and finding your old favorites is fun, especially if they're board games from the '70s. 


While I didn't grow up in the '70s, and you might not have either, some of the biggest banger board games were initially released during that period. The great thing about board games is that the potential for replayability is a huge part of what makes them enjoyable. If you know, you can sit down for hours and have a game that's completely different from your last, and the next one you'll play, you're onto a winner. That's been synonymous with the best board games of every era ever since we first started playing them.

That rise in popularity, however, comes with genre saturation. There are a slew of available titles to consume, but not all of them are top-tier. If you're new to the medium, you would naturally want to start with the best of the best. If you're a long-time reader, then you are certainly on the lookout for more masterpieces to add to your reading list.


As such, here are 10 ongoing fantasy manhwa. I've made sure to vary the titles so that no more than two share the same plot direction, so there's a greater chance of finding something new.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Tiny Glade demo was released in May 2024 as part of Steam’s Next Fest and took the cozy gaming world by storm, reaching a million wishlists on Steam. At the time, Oda Tilset and Martin Kvale, the duo behind NokNok Audio, were giving daily prompts on Twitter.




These prompts went down a storm and not only brought the community together in appreciation of each other's tiny builds but sparked conversation on both Twitter and in the game’s official Discord server. 


I’ve made no secret of how much I adore Tiny Glade. I ended up pouring over 20 hours into the demo, and I'm eagerly (and impatiently) waiting for the full release on September 23, so it goes without saying that I was one of the people sharing my own tiny builds in response to the daily prompts, among many others who did the same.




In the latest development diary from PounceLight, it was revealed that these daily prompts went down so well that they’re implementing them into Tiny Glade itself, and a unique prompt will appear on the main menu of the game each day. There are currently 30 prompts prepared to cover the first month after launch, so there will be a new challenge every single day.

That’s not all that was revealed in the development diary, though. Also noted were more features that players have to look forward to when they get to dive in on September 23, including:



Water effects which are unique to individual seasons


Camera filters, including one that can turn any tiny build into a gorgeous painting



I can’t wait for Tiny Glade to release so that I can fully appreciate all of the hard work put in by Ana and Tom, the duo behind PounceLight, and Oda and Martin. So far, all contact I’ve had with them proves how much they love their work, and it shows in Tiny Glade, with love and passion pouring out of every build.

You only need to have four or five before they take up another shelf on your bookcase, and they don't exactly fit in with your reading materials. That's why it's a good idea to get editions of board games that look like books. 


Don't get me wrong, I love a massive board game box. When the designers really go for it and create something stunning for the artwork on your board games, you want to show it off. Bookshelves aren't exactly the space to do this, though, considering they're made for, well, books. But you can have the best of both worlds with board games and editions that are designed to look like books.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The popularity of manhwa as a medium has surged in recent years, and this trend shows no signs of slowing down as its accessibility increases. One prevalent theme among modern manhwa is the incorporation of tower climbing. While there are numerous available tower climbing manhwa, some are simply not as good as others.


As the name implies, the trope revolves around climbing a mystical tower, which is often referred to as simply The Tower. The structure comes in multiple levels, sometimes exceeding 100 floors. While the outer appearance may seem rather limited, each floor is often a vast new world or dimension. Conquering The Tower often leads to power acquisition or a means to salvation, and these ten manhwa execute this trope to perfection.

Dark romance stories take our emotions and play with them like putty, bending and beating them until all we can do is beg their star-crossed leads to make out, draw blood, or somehow do both at the same time. So let's break the sentimental Play-Doh and sink our teeth into the top ten darkest romance books ever penned.

What was considered weird and obscure in the past decade has become a normalized hobby at present, and it is something to celebrate. After all, not only are more and more manga titles coming to the West, but manhwa and manhua titles, too.


Those new to the hobby may make the easy mistake of thinking the three media are the same. While they do share a lot of similarities, the differences in art style, common themes, inspiration, and formats make each of these media unique in its own way. As such, understanding these differences can help you wade through the vast array of content available and find what best suits your taste.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Initially reported as technical issues, in September 2023 file-hosting platform Uptobox watched as its servers went offline. In reality, they were being taken away due to a criminal complaint filed by Hollywood, Canal+, Apple, Amazon, and other rightsholders. Since then, the owners of Uptobox have turned to the legal system, hoping to salvage whatever they can. On Thursday, a Paris court informed the defendants that their servers will not be returned.

Despite not being used often on the server, the AUG still has a bunch of great skins that you can buy on the Steam Marketplace or open via cases. There are 38 in total to rank - let's get into it.

Counter-Strike 2 AUG Skins Tier List


Our criteria for ranking Counter-Strike 2 AUG skins is easy. We're basing it purely on looks, because you shouldn't be spending your hard-earned money on an expensive AUG skin you don't like. Aesthetics will always be the deal-breaker when buying a CS2 skin, although it's proba…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For the past few years, video game adaptations have had a pretty solid run. The Last of Us made waves on television, The Super Mario Bros. Movie redeemed itself decades after its abysmal 1993 predecessor, and the Sonic the Hedgehog series has thrived on screens big and small. Unfortunately, not all of these attempts can be success stories, and it seems like the upcoming Minecraft movie, simply called A Minecraft Movie, will take movie goers back to a time not so long ago. A time when adapting gaming favorites to the big screen was something that Hollywood just couldn't quite figure out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Catan is a board game that is as commonplace as Monopoly and is enjoyed much more, too. Most don't know, however, about the many standalone editions of Catan that have been released throughout the years that provide unique and new ways to play that you may enjoy far more than the classic.


There are sixteen Catan games in total, and they each have their own reasons for being played and enjoyed. For this list, I'll be ranking the games based on their distinctiveness as well as how fun they are. If a game is pretty fun but is scarcely different from Catan, then it won't really be worth buying.

The future of Astro Bot is even more exciting, with the promise of the DLC expanding the cameo collection. While their identities are shrouded in mystery, we can't help but speculate and eagerly await the next wave of characters. Here are our top picks for the cameos we hope to see next in Astro Bot.

Clue What We Do In The Shadows has you fighting over Lazlo's Witch Hat that Nadja likely hid in the first place


Going pace for pace with the absurd humor in the show, Clue: What We Do In The Shadows concerns itself with Lazlo's Witch Skin Hat. It's up to the players to identify who hid the hat, where they hid it, and the item that was used to conceal it. 


I mean it has to have been Nadja, but sure, we'll pretend like it could have been someone else. Although a particular devious vampire does come to mind...


Image: theopgames


The core gameplay of Clue: What We Do In The Shadows remains the exact same as Clue. This edition is a purely aesthetic one, although it makes for a perfect theme considering that spooky season is around the corner, as is the show's final season (airing 21st October).


If you're stuck for a board game to play whilst Halloween and the new season loom ever closer, you may not find a better candidate than this one. Although I would have personally loved it if they'd added anything new to the standard Clue experience. Alas, I'll still likely enjoy this edition more than the standard Clue just because I get to stare at their pale faces the whole time. It's hard not to think of one of their outrageous quotes every time I see them.


In Clue: What We Do In The Shadows, you get to play as Lazlo, Nadja, Nandor, Colin, Guillermo, and, surprisingly, the Guide. As you try to find who hid the Witch Hat, you'll be searching in iconic settings, such as their bedrooms and the Fancy Room.


This Clue edition is oozing with character and is a novel and fun game to bring to the table for a little festive fun.

Simply bringing up games as a serious option for storytelling could get you laughed out of the room in some circles, but this is slowly changing, and non-explicit narratives are responsible for this.


Now, simply obscuring a game's story is not enough to make it interesting, engaging, or even genuinely worth engaging with. There must still be a spark of something special tucked away behind the monster closets and the resource grinds. Slowly but certainly, more and more developers are figuring out that they don't have to explain themselves to the player in the simplest terms possible.


Some games, like Bungie's classic Marathon for example, have embraced this type of oblique narrative progression…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As written about early in the year, future Intel CPUs will be moving past the "Family 6" identification used since the mid-1990s with the P6 micro-architecture. Since then Intel has continued releasing new CPUs under "Family 6" with different model IDs while AMD has been more open to changing its Family ID every Zen generation or two. With Intel using Family 6 for so long it led to a lot of Linux kernel code just relying on Model ID comparisons for determining between Intel CPU generations and the like. Thus a lot of Intel CPU model handling reworks are needed for preparing future Intel CPU generations that will no longer be in Family 6. With Linux 6.12 it looks like that work will be wrapping up...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In V Rising, you're a fledgling vampire on a mission to become absolute bossferatu of a Gothic open world. You get a Diablo-ish combat system, the ability to shapeshift into a spider, and a whole castle to prance around in, crooning at the moon. I like this premise almost as much as I dislike the fact that V Rising is also a survival game, in which you must fell trees and master a crafting system like a common turnip farmer.


What do we hope for when our interest in a game is almost perfectly balanced by our disinterest? We hope that the developers will treat us to a free-to-play weekend, in which our perhaps-unfounded reservations might be strategically offset by the endorphin rush of not having paid any goddamn money. This, V Rising creators Stunlock have now done. The game is free to download and play on Steam from right now until Monday, 16th September at 5pm UK or 10am PST.

It's also just been Major Updated, with new two player cooperative local and online multiplayer, various quality-of-life tweaks, new recording functionality, and a suite of gameplay changes or fixes to make Larian's eyes water. If you've been holding out for a sim in which "frogs can jump off of other frogs" and "delete that's deleted by delete triggers the delete's deletion as it gets deleted", well, I encourage you to get involved.

Whitethorn Games and North Star Video Games have only come out with a rival: Spray Paint Simulator. In it, you get out your spray painter and "shshshshshs" different colours of paint onto various surfaces. For whatever reason, the universe this takes place in doesn't seem to value brushes or those rolly mops. "No", it says, kicking your brush into the sun. "Spray or nay".

The group in question are the Bureau Européen des Unions de Consommateurs, or BEUC, who represent 44 non-governmental consumer organisations from 31 countries, and have been around since 1962. They're accusing the publishers of Fortnite, EA Sports FC 24, Minecraft, Clash of Clans and others of misleading people -  specifically children - with their in-game premium currencies, and breaching European Union consumer protection laws. On a press site that summarises the results of various longer studies, they offer the below broad complaints about the practice.

It is Diddy Kong Racing but all the courses are water slides. It's Cool Runnings but there are 40 penguins instead of four Jamaicans. Okay, that last one is a bit of a stretch. But basically, yes, this brightly coloured free-to-play knockout racer feels like that one Super Mario 64 level where you race the big penguin down a slide, only this time there are a ton of other players trying to beat you to the secret shortcut. It's coming out next week.

My humble contribution is 50/50, a downloadable or browser-based game which I suspect will fill some of you with the deepest aggravation. As the name suggests, it's about cutting things in half - specifically food items, such as fried eggs (easy enough) and candy canes (WTF). You draw a line down each object with your mouse, then click or hit space bar to perform a slice. Then, the game calculates a percentage.  If it's bang-on or very close to 50/50, you'll pass. If not, you'll have to start over. I know: this is how entire days are wasted. Sorry.

The resignations came in the wake of a dispute between Annapurna Interactive president Nathan Gary and Annapurna studio head Megan Ellison. As Bloomberg report, negotiations were taking place to "spin off the video-game division as an independent entity." After failing to reach an agreement, Ellison pulled out of the negotiations, resulting in the resignation of Gary and “other executives.” Further resignations followed, with a reported two dozen other staff leaving the company.

Unfortunately I can't think about anything other than the Steam Families logo, which is pictured above and is clearly a shocked, possibly aghast face. Or so I thought at first. The more I stare at it, the more it seems to reveal.

Pirates keep jumping to new servers and if promises are kept, fans are getting sued next.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are many reasons to play and write about Arco. The Mesoamerican pixelart landscapes, for example - radiant, cloud-hung platters of land with people and buildings reduced to daubs of paint in the foreground. The fact that it's about witnessing and surviving colonial invasion, rather than the more familiar European or North American video game fantasy of searching a New World for plunder.
The ensemble storytelling, with four, successively playable characters setting their own lenses to thickly entangled themes of sorrow, vengeance and growing understanding. The sparse, expressive dialogue, each phrase carefully tucked inside its speech bubble. The music. And the little things at the level of how you move, what you do. When you pick a faraway destination on your map, your character makes the journey screen by screen, which gives you a second to lean back and be a passenger, watching the horizon, at least until you're ambushed by a giant beetle.

Then again, keeping the mystery intact may have been the point all along. "As a game director, I want to hide everything from the player", GSC’s CEO Ievgen Grygorovych had told me minutes earlier. "I'm fighting with the marketing team because they want to show as much as possible!"

According to a leaked memo, Microsoft are laying off around 650 people "to organize our business for long term success". This is the same Microsoft that parted with around 1900 employees in January, and the same Microsoft that washed their hands of around 10,000 staff in January 2023, all in the name of shoring up the business for future prosperity. That "long term success" is certainly taking its sweet time. Or at least, it is if you're one of the poor saps in the trenches of, in this case, "corporate and supporting functions".

I've never been able to perform it consistently. It's one of many moderately fiddly special attacks - written down for posterity in a tear-stained journal I keep sorrowfully beneath my pillow - which have walled me out of enjoying fighting games, much as I love thinking about them. 


That wall grows ever higher as I age and my digits turn to dust and my dreams of launching Ryu like a sack of potatoes fade into the twilight. Still, at least I can still play and have fun with shooters, right? All you have to do in shooters is press a button once to make stuff go boom. Wait, Nightmare Operator, what are you doing?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Better check those desert dunes again Caravan SandWitch, someone’s buried the lede. An open world you can explore in a few relaxed evenings? One that favours the joyous freeform sightseeing of an Elden Ring or Breath Of The Wild; where you’ll scramble up vast industrial concrete ruins on scavenging missions for inquisitive frogs, instead of being nagged by bothersome checklists?
Ok, rain check on that last point. SandWitch can’t help but eventually funnel the freedom of ambling around in your chuffy yellow van into restrictive collect-a-thons. Still, for much of its breezy runtime, this one’s a real panacea for gaming’s more bloated map-scourers. Plus, even when you are sent off to hamster-cheek scavenged components before making progress, there’s very little in this world that doesn’t feel intentional. Sidequests and storytelling crumbs are deliberately scattered throughout, and each building is a thoughtful concrete puzzle box. It is, in brief, a nice time.
You play as Sauge, a spacefarer returned to her planet of Cigalo after receiving a distress signal from her missing sister. Cigalo’s a cheery place, though economically and environmentally devastated after being exploited by an evil spacecorp named The Consortium. It’s populated by small settlements of people, some large talking frogs named the Reinetos, and the occasional friendly robot. Everything’s friendly, as it goes - even gravity itself. There’s no danger, no death, no damage from flinging yourself off the tallest building you can find. Just helping out your desert buds, upgrading your van with more gadgets to solve puzzles, or working on finding exactly where Sauge’s sister has go to.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Steam’s family sharing feature Steam Families is now available to everyone on the platform, letting up to six total people share games from a single library, with each individual having access to their own saved games, achievements, and workshop files.
This means that, yes, when you all sit down together in the evening, you can enjoy a hearty family meal in the knowledge that between you, you technically own six copies of the Cities Skylines Big Butt Skinner Balloon.
Each person on the account will have one of two roles: adult or child. Adults can manage parental controls, set hourly or daily playtime limits, approve purchase requests, and control store access. Valve appear very proud of making it easier for parents to spend money, streamlining the “time-consuming” task of buying games for their kids.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are cold opens and there are freezing ones. Sci-fi roguelike shooter Wild Bastards doesn't start on its strongest cowboy boot. You are dumped into the middle of an interstellar chase and summarily shown the ropes. The guns feel simplistic, the arenas bare, the loot vanilla, and the entire loop of beaming down to a planet and getting into small-scale "showdowns" threatens to become stale within the first hour or so. But then you find an outlaw buddy who offers a new way to shoot human dirtbags. Then another fellow bandit. And another. By the time your spaceship is half-filled with scoundrels and weirdoes shouting at each other, the game has warmed up enough to reveal its central idea. This ain't no grand FPS campaign, nor is it quick as roguelikes go. It's a snacky shootout sim with tumbleweed towns that feels best when you savour the pre-fight suspense.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier today, Nic did me a great injustice by waving aside my suggestion that he write about Shroom And Gloom, because "I want to read you describing mushrooms in interesting ways". Nic, I have no interesting ways to describe mushrooms right now. I used up all the mushroom lore I've ever gleaned from real-life foraging when I wrote about Morels 2, and I spent most of that article whining about unicorns. The best I can do as regards Shroom And Gloom is to say that these Shrooms do indeed look very Gloomy, possibly because some mad human has wandered into their warren and is now stabbing and eating them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gold Gold Adventure Gold is a game that relies on raw enthusiasm and moxie to power you through a blizzard of confusing references. It boldly describes itself as a "Cult-of-the-Lamb-lite, Rimworld-lite, Majesty-like mixed with Black & White with a pinch of Against the Storm". Whoa there, pardner, save a few subgenres for the rest of us! I think that's half the New & Trending keywords on Steam in one sentence. If you're mystified, best watch the announcement trailer - it paints a clearer picture, though it does involve a startling amount of cartoon decapitation and dismemberment.

This might seem unreasonable if you're not into modding, but the price of updating a game is often that you break any mods designed for it.

Given that The Crew is an online-only game, that signalled its death knell… or death horn, more accurately. Then in April, they tow-trucked the game out of people's libraries and revoked their purchases. This led to a backlash, as you'd expect, and Ubisoft are accordingly taking a different approach with The Crew 2 and The Crew Motorfest. They're giving both an offline mode to "ensure long term access to both titles".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Grand duchess of first-person factory sims Satisfactory has finally hit 1.0 on PC after five years in early access, introducing a "full narrative overhaul" together with some new alien technology which you can witness and boggle at via the 1.0 launch trailer, below. They've also announced a console version, but we don't care for such things. The only Satisfactory console I care about is the one that lets you deactivate the fog so you can obtain an unmurky view of your glittering conveyor belt empire.

All those onscreen 'Nids, yeah? And the stutterfest that was the recent preview build? Surely enough to make a Tech-Priest shed at least one oily tear.

I like to walk in the woods around evening time, after a hard day of writing stupid listicles about Call Of Duty. Forests are a critical preoccupation of mine, actually - check this lumpen thinkypiece I wrote about Alan Wake 2 - but they're also spaces for retreat and reflection, where I can shrug off the angst and lose myself in the spectacle of sycamores and silverbirch, arching over the path. Except. Except that sooner or later I start thinking about the roots.

That process begins with the speedy release of several fan reworkings of the trailer that use something like vanilla Minecraft graphics, rather than the original, unholy fusion of LB Photo Realism and Jack Black. This'll teach Johnny Hollywood to run his grubby hands all over our beloved Creepers, eh.

A modder has cracked open some previously disabled abilities in the official modding toolkit for Baldur's Gate 3, making it possible for folks to create their own levels or alter the game's existing environments. The toolkit (which was only made available last week) previously wouldn't let you do any of that, due to "technical constraints and platform-specific guidelines," according to developers Larian. But modders neither care nor sleep. It took them just two days to worm their way into the devkit's innards and make the impossible possible.

The Maw is ascendant during the darker months, its constellations growing visible to the naked eye. We will need a steady dosage of new PC games to keep it quiescent. Fortunately, this week is looking quite bountiful.

It features ship travel, combat, trade, and base building, and you can do all of it alone or with space mates. It’s got a demo, but it’s also on the cheaper end if you fancy buying into early access. Considering the pricing, I’d say it’s a real looker, too.

The site's operator says the site was shut down "due to DMCA" but, after weathering many storms over the years, maybe there's a little bit more to it than that.

Beyond that, colour me fairly enthused.

It's as though a toddler were actually an undersung class of special operator from a Tom Clancy shooter, rather than a wailing, hyperactive ball of tears and poop. Then again, I imagine Sam Fisher was a toddler once. Perhaps this is how he got started: escaping a smashed-up house full of roaming demon toys.

They've now published another blog post that torches the vagueness of the previous post with the righteously democratic flames of specificity. Overhauls to enemies are on the way, less-loved guns will be more effective, reworks to armor penetration and health values are on the boil, and they're taking inspiration from "player fantasies" for certain weapons and stratagems. All of these tweaks are set to go live on the 17th September, so not long to wait.

Including one bug that sometimes made the game's final boss accidentally invincible. Ah. Yesterday's patch seems to target the worst of these bugs, and the dev team promise there are more fixes are to come.

That was then and this, thankfully, is now. Byrne has tentatively returned to the project and begun sharing screens on social media.

It's a crying shame that it's not currently available to buy anywhere digitally, presumably because the rights are soaked in a gutter between EA (the original publisher) and Microsoft (who bought and closed developers Lionhead).

If you do still own a physical copy of Black & White however, you might be interested in Openblack. It's a fan-led project to create a modern, open source engine for running Black & White, and its first build was just released yesterday.

This week's new hotness is Parking Garage Rally Circuit, which is about powersliding around multi-storey car parks and is designed to look like a lost Sega Saturn game. It now has a release date: September 20th.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Every time you load up Agentia you are reincarnated as a different creature. "Creature" is perhaps too narrow a word - the game's "playable characters" range from geese, microscopic life and triceratops to menhirs and small rocky islands. Each forms the heart of a diamond of delicately drawn, isometric grid terrain with a baby mobile canopy of clouds and sun. It looks like an illustration from an old botanical or geographical textbook, although the inviting emptiness around the visible area also dimly reminds  me of certain elder RPGs I used to play on Macintosh.

Specifically, it did not forget about the incorrigible evil-doers amongst you who've been gunning for some additional plot catharsis. Larian's very bestest RPG has been biding its time in the shadows while you've been busy with other games. It has lingered silently while you've been off heisting on Tatooine or getting all messed up by Golden-Eyed Beasts, waiting and watching for the perfect moment - and now, it has finally struck with an unholy new patch, which adds 13 new Evil Endings, revamped splitscreen and an official modding toolkit. Foolish summer child! It is too late to flee.

I grab the faulty power transformer without listening, and am immediately electrocuted. Worse still, I have to hammer a quick-time button to recover. This is what it is like to be Jerry, the janitor of a cheap and poorly maintained space station. Jerry is being tasked with repair work beyond his job description, learning the ins and outs of an escape pod's machinery from his co-worker via radio. This may come in handy, as the station is about to explode. Tin Can is not a new game (it came out in 2022) but it is on sale as part of Steam's space exploration fest. And I enjoy a space game that makes me panic while alarms go off everywhere.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Full disclosure: I hadn't heard of Bakeru until Graham mentioned it to me. Graham always has his hands on the video game pulse, gliding them over Xwitter or Steam or wherever and waiting for that "ker kun, ker kun" of a new Cool Thing. And that cool thing is Bakeru, described by its Steam page as "Japan-esque", but is in actual fact, very Japanese. I mean, you travel around 47 Japanese prefectures as a metamorphing tanuki who bashes evilness with his taiko drum sticks. Come on.
What I hadn't suspected was Bakeru's chops not only as a platformer, but as a means to increase your chances at success in pub quizzes. The game is a certified trivia Tardis, where you'll learn all sorts about Japanese culture as well as just like, the colour sepia being a genus of cuttlefish.

This is a fairly standard feature for a lot of blockbuster games, but in the world of Warhammer 40K there are so many mega-scale battles with pitch-perfect composition that I found it hard to resist hitting pause and taking a handful of snaps every few minutes. With a keen eye (and a beefy PC) you can capture some wonderfully violent moments.

They're claiming (via in-game broadcast) that the fleeting appearance of a weird purple blob on the map screen is actually the result of fluids leaking from the corpse of a long-dead comms technician, stranded on a server farm somewhere. Who to believe? Ah, if only we had some means of shedding light on the reports. Some way of Illuminating the situation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bear with me on this, but I adore how swordfighting works in Dune. Ubiquitous wearable sci-fi shields repel any attack that comes in too fast, so everyone has to learn this unique, overtly dance-like form of close-quarters combat where every thrust and parry is necessarily slow and considered. Picture it: careful judgments of your movements, weighing up the right time to strike, every measured jab part of a wider strategy that culminates in the kill.
MOBAs are like that. Both in the fights themselves, sort of, where probing lunges lead up to bursts of lethality, but more broadly in each match as a whole. They’re map-wide knife fights, where a thrust is a well-judged lane push and a parry a savvy item buy. At first, playing Smite 2 felt akin to watching on helplessly as my opponents repeatedly shoved their crysknives through my ribs. After 30 hours, it often still feels like that - but I am enjoying myself. Mostly. Despite Valve’s third-person elephant in the lane.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nikhil Murthy's Syphilisation is a "postcolonial 4X game", which might sound like a contradiction in terms. While approaches to 4X and grand strategy vary hugely between games, factions and players, the genre as a whole is firmly wedded to imperial conquest, both structurally and at the level of narrative aspects and set-dressing. Many 4X games are triumphal re-enactments of specific periods of colonial settlement and expansion. All of which is to say that Syphilisation is fascinating. It's a reworking of the genre which dismantles and reconstructs concepts such as diplomacy, research and production. It's also just left early access - find more details and a playthrough video below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been 13 years since the first Space Marine came out. While it wasn't outstanding in the grander landscape of gaming, enough Warhammer 40K fans seem to have cherished the escapades of bulky blue boltgunner Demetrian Titus for the action game to merit a sequel a decade later. It left its story on something of a cliffhanger, with said hero being dragged away to face untold tortures by the Inquisition, the most zealous sect of this preternaturally paranoid sci-fi universe. Today, Titus is free again. Free to stomp towards hordes of alien foes, blast them with a plasma incinerator, and shred the stragglers with a chainsaw sword. Space Marine 2 is an often-satisfying scrapper that has me  convinced of 40K's merit as a crafting ground for excellent-looking environments and creatures, even if I'm not particularly moved by the bland character of Titus and his fellow Ultramarines.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Warner Bros have released the first trailer for Vertigo and Legendary's Minecraft movie, the long-awaited or possibly, long-dreaded adaptation of Mojang's industry-straddling block-builder. Quick disclosure: I worked with Mojang and Microsoft on a book about Minecraft's first 15 years, shortly before joining Rock Paper Shotgun. As such, I am now obliged by the eternal laws of journalistic accountability to state that anything Minecraft-related is rubbish. But even if that weren't the case, I would describe this as pretty dismal.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Babbdi was a game of stark and severe Brutalist aesthetics, and also, a game about playing scales with a trumpet, walljumping with a baseball bat and using a leafblower to fly. Snuck out over winter 2022, it was a sombre but delightful freebie with immense though well-hidden imagination, in which your only explicit objective was to find a way out of a small concrete city.
Now, developers Lemaitre Bros are making a gott-dang 1v1 FPS called Straftat, slated for release on 24th October 2024 with over 100 arenas. It's similarly in love with concrete, but it also has blunderbusses, dual-wielding, Gatling guns, corner-peeking, curved swords, cowboy hats and beehive hairdos.

Deliver At All Costs is a chaotic courier sim set in those heady days that sees the player barrelling around a "semi-open" US town as they take on absurd odd jobs. "From delivering a giant flailing Marlin, to the disposal of an atomic bomb teetering on the edge of explosion," say the developers, "always expect the unexpected." It's maybe best understood by witnessing the moment in the trailer below where the player drifts right through a menswear store, bringing the whole building down. Yep, that looks like a good time.

Literally, they light up like the pilot lights of flamethrowers, like glyphs on a cursed monolith that has been exposed to fresh blood after a billion years of dormancy. When I hear that the aforesaid RPG is set on a "dying space station", I begin to emit a monotonous reverberation, like the mysterious banging recently heard aboard the Boeing Starliner. And when I hear that it's being made by the people behind Shadowrun and Battletech, I extend dozens of independently cognitive motorised tentacles and begin writing a news article.

To shreds, I say - it’s currently sitting at 79% ‘mostly negative’ rating on Steam. Among the chief complaints are…uh, everything, it looks like. The DLC is reportedly so bug-ridden that it’s taken many of the base game’s core systems down with it.
Gearbox - who acquired Risk Of Rain from Hopoo Games in 2022 - have since put out a blog with a list of known issues they’re targeting, and encourage players to keep submitting bug reports. Among the listed issues are a boss named Mithrix becoming invincible (“definitely not intentional”), and “an issue that allowed players to get stuck while smelling the flowers”.

Most chilling of all, Aldi have discontinued their Village Bakery Seeded Medium Sliced Loaf (400g), replacing it with deeply inferior Village Bakery Lightly Seeded Loaf (800g). Throughout the chaos, the Maw simply grins, although it does seem to have a few more seeds betwixt its teeth than last week. Perhaps the Maw will deign to spit a single seed at us, from which we can grow the sapling of a new world and finally abandon this cursed, Medium Loafless existence.

Je chvályhodné, pokud tento film pomůže zlepšit podmínky v dětských domovech, ale bez hromady doprovodných informací není ani zřejmé, že má mít nějaký takový účel.
