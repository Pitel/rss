The indie title Sports Story didn't get off to the best start last year when it was shadow-dropped. Since then, Sidebar Games has been working hard to deliver a number of fixes. With this in mind, Version 1.0.5 will be arriving in the near future.
The patch notes for this update have already been released, and what's interesting is there are even more changes to the "Secret Dev Room" listed. Here's the full rundown:

Welcome back! It’s time for a new episode of the Spot Dodge Podcast exclusively on Destructoid. Topics: Tonight we’ll be talking all about the upcoming Pokemon Presents. Along with that, a war still wages between Sony and Microsoft regarding acquiring Activision-Blizzard. A deal that will have huge ramifications across the industry, even for Nintendo. As Microsoft has signed an agreement with Nintendo to release Call of Duty and other "Xbox games" on Nintendo platforms. So much to talk about!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G44xNUznQS4&ab_channel=Destructoid
There's a high chance we get our first look at the next major Pokemon game during this week's Pokemon Presents. One area I really hope the following games are improved in is the performance. Pokemon Scarlet and Violet are still riddled with bugs and performance issues which is a shame, as they're great games to their core. Lastly, Pokemon titles are sorely missing from the latest Nintendo Switch Online announcement regarding Game Boy and Game Boy Advance games coming to the service. Tonight on Spot Dodge we'll talk all about Pokemon in 2023.
Spot Dodge is a weekly Nintendo-focused Podcast here at Destructoid where we dedicate an hour or two to go over the latest Nintendo news and discuss the games we’re playing. If you’re a fan of Nintendo Switch, RPGs, or having a good time, Spot Dodge will be a great addition to your podcast rotation. So be sure to subscribe!
Spot Dodge is streaming live every Tuesday at 4:00 p.m. PT / 7:00 p.m. ET on Twitch channel. ICYMI: We now have a dedicated Spot Dodge YouTube channel for our archived streams! All future episodes will be uploaded there.
Afterward, the show will be available on-demand for audio listeners via Spotify, Apple Podcasts, and more. The live video version will remain on Twitch until  (don’t forget to follow and subscribe). So many options!

If you’re the type that likes their games to have that new plastic smell, Moon: Remix RPG Adventure (which sometimes just goes by moon, but I refuse) is getting physical housing by way of Limited Run Games. It will come in both standard and collectors edition flavors. It’s perhaps worth noting that this is not a numbered release and, therefore, not part of the Limited Run Collection. It’s simply being distributed on Onion Games’ behalf.

Koei Tecmo has locked in a launch date for its remake of the first Atelier game. Atelier Marie Remake: Alchemist of Salburg is set to hit Switch, PlayStation 5, PS4, and PC via Steam on July 13, 2023.
Previously confirmed for a summer 2023 window during the recent Nintendo Direct in Japan, Atelier Marie Remake will "reintroduce" players to Marie, a struggling student at the Royal Academy of Magic. Marie's goal? Make an item within five years that will appease her teacher. But that's easier said than done.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38j5TByJ0nM
Gathering and collecting alchemy materials, and then synthesizing them into items, is a core part of the story. You can fulfill requests for those in the town, upgrade your atelier, and hire little helpers to assist. On top of this, there are some RPG battles to undertake, potentially leading to encounters with legendary monsters. Turns out magic school is pretty rough.
Atelier Marie Remake is playable with either the story-imposed five-year time limit, or with an "Unlimited Mode" which turns off the time crunch. Either way, Gust's RPG gets a fresh look and a bevy of new platforms to play it on.
Stirring the pot
As the Atelier series grows in popularity, it's cool to see this piece of history get a refresh for modern systems. All the life sim elements may even seem more appealing to players now, who may have put a fair number of hours into games like Stardew Valley and are looking for a new RPG with similar vibes.
In other Atelier news, Atelier Ryza 3: Alchemist of the End & the Secret Key is due out on March 24, 2023 after taking a one-month delay to work on the game. Even with the delay, though, the upcoming spring and summer looks to have plenty for armchair alchemists to dig into.

The Super FX chip was a handsome feather in Nintendo’s cap, even if they very rarely wore it out on the town. A graphics support unit, the Super FX chip was a co-processor that pushed the SNES’ graphic capabilities pretty far. Games like Star Fox and Super Mario World 2: Yoshi’s Island benefitted from the tech and were able to punch above their generational weight class.
Regardless, only Yoshi’s Island doesn’t look entirely antiquated by today’s standards. While 3D graphics were novel at the time, their mostly flat-shaded surfaces came at a tremendous price when it came to framerate. Because of their overall choppiness, games that were classics once can be difficult to play through a modern lens.

Whether you’re diving into VR for the first time or you’ve played plenty on competing headsets, here is a list of games, presented in alphabetical order, I enjoyed for the first time, or all over again in PlayStation VR2.
  



      
												
After The Fall
After the Fall is a horde zombie shooter. If you’ve played Left 4 Dead or any of the games inspired by it, you basically know what to expect here. It turns out, however, that this genre works really well in VR. You won’t quite face the …]]></summary>

This is an awesome price for one of the fastest SSDs on the market, with the advent of the even faster (but significantly more expensive) 990 Pro pushing the previous flagship to nearly bargain basement territory.

The Doom Slayer is ready to take on demons with a new perspective. Mighty Doom is a new mobile, single-touch shooter starring the Mini Slayer, arriving on March 21 for iOS and Android.
Created by Alpha Dog Games and Bethesda, this particular version of Doom events takes place in the "animated Doom universe." The Slayer is stolen away to another universe and is on a simple mission: get back their pet bunny Daisy, and destroy any demons in their way.

Level-5 will hold a live stream presentation next month, offering updates on a selection of titles currently in development at the Japanese studio. The "Level-5 Vision 2023 Tsuzumi" will take place on March 9.
The stream will include new news and details pertaining to upcoming Level-5 releases such as Decapolice, Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road, Megaton Musushi Wired, Fantasy Life I: The Girl Who Steals Time, and the recently revealed Professor Layton and The New World of Steam.
As noted by Gematsu, this live stream announcement is not only the first revelation of a new Megaton Musashi title, along with the debut of a localized title for the Inazuma Eleven release. The live stream will feature English subtitles, which suggests that the studio has global plans for some of its upcoming wares — with the new Professor Layton title being perhaps of the highest interest for puzzle fans.
The Level-5 Vision 2023 Tsuzumi stream will kick off March 9 at 20:00 JST / 03:00 PT / 12:00 BST. We'll be sure to bring you all of the hot gossip from the stream right here on Destructoid, so you don't have to sweat staying up for the wee small hours.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fantastic!
Get ready to fire up those tactical neurons in your brain, as Idea Factory and Compile Heart’s Fairy Fencer F Refrain Chord is set to bring the grid-based combat on April 25.
Fairy Fencer F Refrain Chord is a tactical RPG set in a world where the Goddess and the Vile God have an ongoing feud. Their last encounter resulted in them sealing each other away in the time-out corner. However, they’ve dropped a mess of leftover weapons that are sought by warriors known as Fencers. You join a fencer named Fang and his companions as they set out to find the Furies and resurrect the Goddess.
[embed]https://youtu.be/qUd5UloNCQQ[/embed]
You can expect your usual slate of TRPG mechanics, such as terrain modifiers, buffs, and spells. You can also use your collected Furies to stab the world map (?) to unlock hidden locations and fairies.
I love fairies, but I know absolutely nothing about the Fairy Fencer F series and had to do a bunch of research just to make sure I wasn’t saying something inaccurate when I summarized what it’s all about. Our own CJ Andriesson, on the other hand, gave it a mention as a runner-up to his most anticipated games of the year. Personally, I’m a big fan of CJ’s taste in games, so I take stock in that. Hopefully, he’ll grace us with a review of it, but I’m neither his editor nor his mom, so that’s up to him.
Fairy Fencer F Refrain Chord will be hitting PS4, PS5, and Switch on April 25, 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Take the SPD and deal with it
Capcom has begun location tests for a new virtual reality experience set within the world of its flagship fighting franchise, Street Fighter. The Street Fighter VR: The Shadaloo Enhancement Project is currently available to play in the Capcom store at Hiroshima Plaza in Hiroshima, Japan.
The short experience allows players to step up to the plate against long-time poster boy Ryu and Russian wrestler Zangief in first-person combat, with sound and visuals running on the same engine used for Street Fighter V. The concept sees the player take the role of a lowly Shadaloo grunt, training against two of the World Warriors that they may encounter as the evil organization attempts its takeover of the free world. Yeah... That's exactly who I want to play in VR: A nameless, nobody, Shadaloo trainee.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY3rBDYNXRs&ab_channel=asciijpnews
Utilizing PC VR hardware, players must block attacks and counter with punches and special moves, impacting certain areas on the opponent while their guard is down. A short video not only demonstrates a player throwing out an iconic Hadoken projectile, but also sees the hapless protagonist caught in Zangief's Spinning Pile Driver, which I can only assume is a VR experience likely to demonstrate the technological power of your own stomach.
"Stop playing if you feel sick or feel something is wrong with your body." reads the warning. Indeed.
The demo ends with hints that further characters — such as Akuma and Shadaloo leader Bison himself — will be added to the game in future updates. Capcom has not announced any plans to bring Street Fighter VR: The Shadaloo Enhancement Project to western locations, but I would not be surprised if it at least showed up at one of the booths at the big summer expos such as E3 or Summer Game Fest.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some Pokemon news is on the way
We're getting an update on what's in store for the Pokemon franchise next week. A new Pokemon Presents stream has been scheduled for Feb. 27, airing at 9 a.m. ET / 6 a.m. PT.
The show will stream on the Pokemon YouTube channel starting at 6 a.m. PT, and will run for roughly 20 minutes.
https://twitter.com/Pokemon/status/1628032454295531522
The stream will spotlight "about 20 minutes of exciting Pokemon news," as part of the Pokemon Day 2023 celebration.
Gotta catch 'em all
Speculation on what could be in this Pokemon Presents is easy to center on the most recent entry, Pokemon Scarlet and Violet. Any potential DLC for the latest Pokemon generation would be interesting to see, and there are a lot of places the series could go after the events and ending of Scarlet and Violet.
A hint of what's ahead could be interesting, though the Pokemon team has been hard at work tuning up Scarlet and Violet after it launched with a number of technical issues.
Still, there are many other places The Pokemon Company could go for additional announcements and reveals. A new spin-off or follow-up to a cult-classic is always a welcome surprise, especially with some of the recent ones the company has put together. Is it too much to hope for Pokemon Conquest to make a comeback?
Add in potential updates to live-service titles like Pokemon Unite, and there's a lot the stream could hold for February 27. No matter what, I'm interested to see what the future holds for Pokemon. Last year was very Poke-heavy, as we got two big entries in the series. And with next week's stream, we might get to see what the road looks like beyond the launch of Scarlet and Violet.
Tune in for the stream on February 27 at 9 a.m. ET / 6 a.m. PT on the Pokemon YouTube channel here.

A new State of Play is on the way, spotlighting upcoming games for Sony's consoles. The PlayStation State of Play airs on Feb. 23 at 4 p.m. ET / 1 p.m. PT.
The focus for this stream looks to be third-party titles. Sony will kick things off with some looks at "anticipated" games from its third-party partners, including indies. Five new PlayStation VR2 titles are also due to be announced.
Then, we'll get over 15 minutes of new gameplay details and updates on Rocksteady's upcoming Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. No estimated runtime was given, though it sounds at least somewhat lengthy from the amount of Suicide Squad alone.

This PlayStation State of Play is the first of the year for Sony, and looks set to spotlight what's on the way for its hardware, both in the PlayStation 5 and the imminent PlayStation VR2.
We've already seen 2023 kick-off streams from both Xbox and Nintendo. So with this stream, Sony is taking the opportunity to set the tone for its year ahead.
With that in mind, the lack of first-party games here does feel a bit surprising. We don't really know what Sony's first-party lineup looks like for 2023, outside an assumption that Marvel's Spider-Man 2 will play a part in it.
Still, Sony State of Play streams have had some surprises before, and the third-party developers could bring some surprises. There are other games we've yet to hear more about due out later this year, including Street Fighter 6 and Final Fantasy XVI, both of which have featured in Sony's previous streams.
PlayStation VR2 is also front-of-mind for Sony, it seems. With five games, that will make up at least a decent chunk of the stream, and probably be exciting for anyone picking up the new headset this week. We'll see what all Sony has in store for its PlayStation State of Play on Feb. 23.

The first time I encountered "VR" was at a county fair in the '90s. It was for a racing game demo, and basically amounted to putting a TV on your head...I think I lost some of my eyesight that day. It was an absolutely fascinating experience all the same, and I've kept my eye on the tech ever since.
Once the first consumer-grade Oculus Rift headset launched, I was there, and saw all of the advancements of the subsequent two decades since the TV-helmet at once: but there was so much more work to do. For the past seven years or so, VR has struggled to balance power and comfort. The Oculus Quest 2 is comfortable, but not super powerful. Other headsets focus on power at the expense of clunk, like multiple finnicky tracking devices. The PlaySt…]]></summary>

It's been a couple of weeks now since February's Nintendo Direct and you want to know the one thing that we are still not quite over? There's a new Professor Layton game coming our way! It almost doesn't sound right saying that out loud: "a new Professor Layton game". Not a remaster. Not a rerelease. Something new. So new, in fact, that the team at Level-5 has even stuck it in the title: Professor Layton and the New World of Steam.
What do we know about the game at the moment? Well, not a lot if we're being honest.

The event begins at 1 p.m. Pacific/4 p.m. Eastern on Twitch and YouTube and will reveal five new PSVR2 titles. Beyond that, it doesn’t seem like we should expect anything first-party related.

Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, which launches in May, will also have an in-depth segment with extended footage.

It’s time to wrap your tongue around Ninja Jajamaru-kun, as ININ Games has released a few localized collections of his most prominent adventures.

First, we have Ninja JaJaMaru: The Great Yokai Battle +Hell. This is a brand-new game for the series that acts as a celebration of its history. You’ll choose from a growing cast of characters to stomp yokai as you make your way to the catfish pirate.

After more than half a decade in development, Atomic Heart has arrived as the first title from developer Mundfish. This BioShock-inspired shooter is an impressive debut in many ways, and it wears its influences on its sleeve – for better and worse. The game’s dazzling world design, extraordinary production values, and fast-paced fights make for a solid campaign, but the derivative plot and often painful writing insist on dragging it down.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are better vacation destinations...
Bethesda Softworks has released a new trailer for Redfall, the cooperative monster masher currently in the works at Arkane Studios. The new preview spotlights the titular Massachusetts town, which is currently under siege from a frightening plague of deadly vampiric beings.
This particular trailer is mostly action-free, instead focusing on the many locales wherein our sassy band of monster hunters will ply their explosive trade. From the high street to the local school, movie theaters to woodland areas, museums to farmland — There is no part of the once-beautiful town that has not become awash with the undead and its hapless victims. They say the only way out is through, and Redfall is gonna get a whole lot messier before it gets better.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6B5IHYvI9M&t=158s&ab_channel=BethesdaSoftworks
Redfall will see parties of up to four players gather together their weaponry, gear, and unique abilities in order to outrun and outgun the bloodsuckers. Protagonists Layla Ellison, Devinder Crousley, Jacob Boyer, and Remi de la Rosa are themselves equipped with distinct skills — from incredible feats of engineering to powerful psychokinetic abilities — all of which will no doubt come in handy as they ransack Redfall in a serious bout of exorcism, all conducted at the business end of a barrel. Players will be encouraged to adapt their loadout to best synergize their squad against the nightmare horrors that await them.
Following its unfortunate delay, Redfall remains in development for PC and Xbox and is now expected to launch on both platforms May 2.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The tower of power
3D platformer Demon’s Turf is expanding its territory with some free DLC on March 6.
[embed]https://youtu.be/n5jPUQHu9n0[/embed]
The Tower expansion will see Beebz stripped of her powers by a malicious Jester, and to get them back, she’ll need to climb to the top of a tower. The DLC adds “rogue-lite-esque” gameplay by means of a series of challenges that you’ll need to topple in a single attempt, lest you’re sent back to the beginning to start over. Unlike your typical rogue-lite, the tower isn’t randomized, and you’ll get permanent new powers as you climb higher. The tower itself is one stated to be “one huge level” with no loading zones. On top of this are new story elements with familiar and new characters.
Alongside the DLC, Fabraz and Playtonic Friends will be holding a contest that will dole out rewards for anyone who can accomplish a variety of feats that prove they’ve got beefier thumbs than the others. This includes being the first to topple the tower, getting the fastest run to the top, or beating the tower on “hex mode.” I’ll drop the details below.

I mostly let Demon’s Turf drop off my radar after my initial review of it. It just didn’t click with me. However, it did better with some people who are less curmudgeonous than I am, so if it sounds rad to you, this DLC might be the non-dairy coffee whitener that you need to give it a taste.
Demon’s Turf is available on PC, Switch, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PS4, and PS5. The Tower DLC will be dropping March 6, 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pocket Punchers
At the finale of this weekend's Capcom Cup IX festivities, Capcom and Crunchyroll Games announced that mobile RPG title Street Fighter: Duel will make its global debut on February 28, bringing its pocket-sized scrapper action to iOS and Android devices. Pre-registration is available now on both platforms.
Set against the backdrop of the Super Street Fighter IV timeline, Street Fighter: Duel tasks players with building up a faction of fighters with which to take on both Shadaloo and S.I.N. — led by the all-consuming CEO/Naked Puppet Man, Seth. The pint-sized RPG first launched in China back in 2020, so it's certainly taken its sweet time to make its way overseas to western shores. Street Fighter: Duel will launch with a huge roster of 40 unlockable characters, with future updates on the books.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SH9evri9ezo&ab_channel=CrunchyrollCollection
Street Fighter: Duel looks to offer up typical mobile action, built around leveling up characters, mashing through battles, and unlocking further characters, buffs, and abilities — punctuated by a slew of microtransactions. While the gameplay and format can be expected to be typically divisive, I do dig the cartoony alternate takes on the World Warriors' classic appearances. I'll be sure to check out the game upon launch, and we'll see whether Crunchyroll is headed for a K.O., or whether it's lining up to be another popular franchise that fails to translate to the mobile RPG market.
Street Fighter: Duel launches February 28 on iOS and Android. A PC and console port is planned for the summer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Time is flying by a little too fast in 2023, although it’s not all bad news as a new month means new Game Pass additions. Microsoft have announced the next four games hitting the service before March 3rd, alongside Atomic Heart which releases today. I was interested in the steely Soviet shooter until I read James’ review and saw that the protagonist yells “Crispy critters,” more than once - I think I’ll skip.


Here are the next batch of Game Pass titles:

Merge & Blade (Feb 28th)
Soul Hackers 2 (Feb 28th)
F1 22 (March 2nd)
Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty (March 3rd)

This is my first time hearing of Merge & Blade, not to be confused with Mount & Blade which is also on Game Pass. Merge & Blade is a hybrid between puzzle games and auto-battlers. Rounds will start with a Tetris-like mini-game, but instead of shapes, you’re guiding different unit types and merging them together. You then use your completed party to raid castles and kill monsters. Mixing - or merging - Tetris into a new genre is a recipe for success, so I’ll definitely be downloading this one.

Japanese publication Famitsu has scored the Kirby remake an impressive 8/9/9/9, or 35/40. For reference, the original Wii game scored 9/9/8/10 — 36/40 (from GoNintendo, archived) — back in 2011.

Yesterday, my Review in Progress for Atomic Heart went live, focusing on a few of my thoughts covering the first ten hours of the game. When I submitted my draft for edits, I honestly didn't know where I stood with the game.
There were elements I liked about it, mostly centered around its art direction, as well as some design choices that didn't necessarily sit well with me. With a lot of games, ten hours is more than enough time to draw a clear conclusion about how you feel about it. With Atomic Heart, I needed to see it through to the end.
And then I needed to see it through to its other end.

The official Pokémon Twitter account announced this today, with a short 15-second video hyping up the presentation. There's not too much to glean from the video, but it does feature the main theme from Pokémon Red and Blue. Since the reveal earlier this month that Game Boy and Game Boy Advance games are playable on Switch via Nintendo Switch Online, fans have speculated that older Pokémon games like Red, Blue, Yellow, Gold, Silver, Crystal, and even Ruby, Sapphire, and Emerald could appear on the service one day. Perhaps that's an announcement we'll be getting this Sunday.

#PokemonDay 2023! 🎉

February 21, 2023
With the presentation lasting 20 minutes, there's plenty of time for an announcement like that and more. And in recent years, the Pokémon Day direct-style presentation has been quite stellar. Last year during the Pokémon Day stream, Pokémon Scarlet and Violet were announced alongside a big Pokémon Legends: Arceus update, a Pokémon Brillaint Diamond and Shining Pearl mystery gift (Shaymin), the Alola update for Pokémon GO, and other announcements for games like Pokémon Unite, Pokémon Masters EX, and Pokémon Cafe Remix. The Pokémon Company event announced a new online anime, too. 
Only time will tell if this year's Presents features as many exciting announcements. Fortunately, we don't have to wait long because Pokémon Day is Monday, February 27. The Pokémon Presents begins at 6 a.m. PT/9 a.m. ET and will run about 20 minutes. 
In the meantime, read Game Informer's Pokémon Scarlet and Violet review and then read our review of Pokémon Legends: Arceus.

Since the acquisition announcement last year, Microsoft has been attempting to prove to government agencies like the U.S.' Federal Trade Commission that this acquisition does not fall into any monopolistic activity and would not harm competitors like PlayStation. However, Microsoft has had a bit of a rough go at it. To counter, though, the company has been proactive in attempting to get the greenlight from the FTC, going as far as promising PlayStation that Call of Duty games will continue to come to Sony's consoles and agreeing to bring Call of Duty to Nintendo hardware. 
Now, Microsoft president and vice chair Brad Smith has announced on Twitter that Microsoft has formally signed a legally binding 10-year agreement with Nintendo to bring Call of Duty games to Nintendo players. Here's the statement Smith released on behalf of Microsoft, in full: 
We’ve now signed a binding 10-year contract to bring Xbox games to Nintendo’s gamers. This is just part of our commitment to bring Xbox games and Activision titles like Call of Duty to more players on more platforms. pic.twitter.com/JmO0hzw1BO
February 21, 2023
Many have already begun to speculate how Activision Blizzard will bring Call of Duty games to Nintendo consoles, which are traditionally much less powerful than current-gen Xbox and PlayStation consoles, with "full feature and content parity." 
If I had to guess, Call of Duty will likely go the route of cloud gaming seen on the Switch, unless Nintendo's next console is set to be a significantly more powerful piece of hardware. Only time will tell. 
In the meantime, read Game Informer's thoughts on the latest Call of Duty in our Modern Warfare II review.

Sonic the Hedgehog is no stranger to change. The franchise has crossed paths with multiple genres across the decades, from its humble beginnings as a 2D platformer to the latest "open-zone" 3D title Sonic Frontiers, and everything in between.
But what would happen if you took the concept of classic 2D Sonic and mixed it with the core aesthetics of Donkey Kong Country? Well, as spotted by our good pals over on Time Extension, you'd get Super Sonic System, a brand new fan-made game from @OMinecraftera, who has successfully completed building a stage called 'Green Passageway'.

The deal, announced on Twitter by no less than MS president Brad Smith, is said to be part of a new endeavor by the company to see Xbox titles ported to Nintendo Switch and future platforms.
The new signing — super-duper coincidentally — has been announced on the same day that Microsoft is to appear at a hearing with the European Commission, combatting concerns that the publisher's proposed acquisition of Activision Blizzard raises antitrust concerns. Of course, Activision Blizzard is the publisher of the billion-dollar Call of Duty franchise, and thus Microsoft has signed its "legally binding" 10-year de…]]></summary>

Bandai Namco has released its first character trailer for fantastic looking fighter Tekken 8 — And, perhaps as it should be, the first combatant to step into the King of Iron Fist Tournament is Tekken's original protagonist, the nefarious Kazuya Mishima.
The flashy, no-nonsense trailer sees the former Mishima Zaibatsu head going to work on his offspring and long-time rival Jin Kazama, laying in the spine-bending leg sweeps and spin kicks that wowed arcade goers way back in 1994. Decked to the nines in a slick suit and alligator skin coat, Kazuya utilizes extended chains and impactful single strikes to knock his boy seven ways 'till Sunday, ultimately calling upon the terrifying Devil Gene in order to get the job done.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFAMYW2POBw&t=96s&ab_channel=BandaiNamcoEntertainmentAmerica
In addition to the Kazuya showcase, the new trailer also shows off a stunning Times Square-style battleground, awash in neon signage, theater marquees, and nightlife. The new trailer is a super showcase of the power behind Tekken 8's Gen-9-only technology, with amazing particle effects and dazzling, crisp colors. The trailer feels like a statement of intent, assuring fans that they're about to get a taste of Tekken like never before, propelling the long-life franchise into the new year and beyond.
Tekken 8 is currently in development for PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X with an expected 2024 release date.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You be there
Ubisoft is making plans to be at this year's E3. Following comments from the publisher during an investor's call, Ubisoft has confirmed it will be in attendance at E3 2023.
During an investor's call, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot responded to an inquiry on whether the company would be in attendance at this year's event. "If E3 happens, we will be there and we will have a lot of things to show," said Guillemot at the time.
In a follow-up to GamesIndustry.biz, Ubisoft clarifies the wording:
"E3 is a special moment for our industry and we are excited to showcase our strong line-up in Los Angeles in June. We are still finalizing the details of our plans and look forward to sharing more soon."

It's a good clarification, at least, for those who may have thought E3 was changing things up once again following Guillemot's comment. ReedPop did reaffirm that E3 is "full speed ahead" after Guillemot's initial comment, but with this clarification, that's at least one company that looks set to show something in Los Angeles. [Disclosure: I was previously employed at USgamer, a former ReedPop website.]
The summer of games awaits
Questions of who's attending E3 2023 are still up in the air. An IGN report confirmed Sony, Nintendo, and Xbox wouldn't be on the show floor, though Microsoft is planning to host a summer showcase in Los Angeles.
The current plan has E3 2023 running from June 13 through 16 in Los Angeles, with both industry and consumer days planned.
Meanwhile, Ubisoft says it is bringing a "strong line-up" to bear for its Los Angeles showing. The publisher has been on a bit of a roller-coaster, announcing a bevy of Assassin's Creed projects while also cancelling a number of unannounced projects and delaying Skull and Bones. It'll be interesting to see what it shows up with in June.

Steelkrill Studios, the makers of lo-fi horror game The Backrooms 1998, have announced that they’ll be releasing The Voidness into the void of Early Access on March 17, 2023.
The Voidness is a unique horror game with an experimental twist. For much of the game, you’re immersed in complete darkness and are only able to perceive your surroundings with a lidar scanner. A lidar, or laser imaging, detection, and ranging scanner, is a device that uses lasers to create a constructive image of the area it’s pointed at. It has many uses, as it can create 3D maps of geographic locations and features.
[embed]https://youtu.be/M66MeyC_gzA[/embed]
For The Voidness, however, lidar will be your only means of seeing what’s around you, and that includes anything that might be trying to eat you. The developer also touts that, like in The Backrooms 1998, enemies will listen in on your PC microphone. That sounds more like a feature utilized by streamers, as I don’t make it a habit of talking to my computer monitor. However, I’m always down for an experimental approach to game design.
I haven’t personally played The Backrooms 1998, but I’ve seen it spoken of fondly in the indie horror circles I observe. It has also been picked up by popular streamers and has enjoyed it reasonable amount of success as a result. I might have to give it a good look-over once it leaves early access. The Voidness is another game to add to that list, as the developer states that its Early Access period will last anywhere from “a few months or a couple years.”
The Voidness will launch on PC via Steam Early Access on March 17, 2023.

At the climax of this weekend's Capcom Cup, the last such tournament to be held on Street Fighter V, the publisher revealed that its next pro-season, Capcom Cup X, will have a $2 million USD prize pool, with the first crowned Street Fighter 6 champion walking away with a cool one million dollars.
Street Fighter 6, which launches on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms June 6, will be the exclusive game of Capcom Cup X, and will see players from all over the globe become literal World Warriors, catching flights to a wide variety of official tournaments in order to bag the CPT points necessary to make it to the grand finals — expected to be held in early 2024. The huge prize pool is expected to see many players, perhaps even retirees, dust off the arcade stick and go for their moment of glory.
https://twitter.com/StreetFighter/status/1627566668821172224?s=20
Of course, the promotion of such a lucrative tournament also works in Capcom's favor, as it keeps hype for the new sequel high, as well as encourages large turnouts at the many events that will be held all over the globe between Street Fighter 6's launch this summer and the ultimate showdown next year. Street Fighter 6, as I have iterated many a time, is already shaping up to be a fantastic release, one that hopes to see the brand reestablish itself as the competitive fighting game.
Me? Well, while I will no doubt continue to attend every tournament I am able — much as I did for Street Fighter V — I simply have far too much work to do to grab for the brass ring...

The fan group Team K4L have announced that their translation of Kurohyou: Ryu Ga Gotoku Shinshou will be released this August. Initially, they had hoped to release it last year, but unfortunately had to delay it.
Sega has come a long way when it comes to localizing their Yakuza/Like a Dragon series, so we’ve been eating well. Like a Dragon: Ishin! was once argued by Sega as being a poor choice for localization, but despite that, we just recently finally got it over here. However, in a recent interview with The Gamer chief producer Hiroyuki Sakamoto said of Kurohyou, “I think if we wanted to develop something, we're not really looking at the past, we're looking to the future, and we think that we want to put our efforts and our priorities at making new titles for Like a Dragon.” That’s not a “no, definitely not,” but it’s not looking good, so it’s always great to see fans step in to bring a title to a wider audience.
[embed]https://youtu.be/dkkGKxAhNr0[/embed]
Kurohyou: Ryu Ga Gotoku Shinsho is a 2010 spin-off of the series for PSP. Rather than an attempt to simply transplant the Like a Dragon/Yakuza formula to the portable, Sega enlisted AKI Corporation (now known as syn Sophia) to put their own spin on it. AKI should be a familiar name to anyone who played N64 wrestling games, as they’re the developers behind WCW/NWO Revenge and WWF No Mercy. These titles, as well as the others they put out on the console, are still regarded as some of the best pro wrestling games ever released.
The gameplay focuses more on one-on-one combat, but the narrative features the familiar neighborhood of Kamurocho and is packed with mini-games and side quests. Combat is modeled closer to Def Jam Fight for NY, rather than the more beat-’em-up brawling of your typical Yakuza/Like a Dragon game.
K4L will be releasing the translation patch this August under the name Kurohyou (Like a Dragon: Black Panther).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been a year and a half since release
If you missed Monster Hunter Stories 2 when it came out in mid-2021, I don't blame you. There's a host of reasons why a lot of folks skipped out on it, but the good news is that Capcom is permanently reducing the price of the game: which will also impact the aftermarket.
Announced openly on Twitter, Capcom had this to say:
"Ride on! Grab Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin for #NintendoSwitch and PC/Steam at a new price of $39.99. Start your journey today with the demo and transfer your progress over to the full game."

That price is already reflected in the digital edition of the game on both Switch and Steam. Note that there is a "Digital Deluxe Edition" though, which is now $50. The new $40 standard isn't present everywhere though, as a search through various digital storefronts came up with a $60 digital voucher code price. Keep that in mind if you're ever shopping for the game! It'll take a bit for everything to really sink in everywhere, but used copies are already dropping to $30 and below in some marketplaces (like Amazon).
There's also the chance that Monster Hunter Stories 2 will be part of the ever-present Capcom sale periods, so you could get it for even cheaper. In this economy, it goes without saying that we could use more price drops.

The latest UK charts are in, and without any new releases to speak of in the top ten this week, there is merely a slight reshuffling of the deck.
In the top ten, Splatoon 3 has made a bit of a comeback this week, climbing up six spots from position sixteen to position ten. Meanwhile, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe maintains its current position at number four, which it has held for the last three weeks running. Animal Crossing New Horizons has dropped a few spots, but is still holding on strong, while Nintendo Switch Sports maintains its own position at number eight for the second week in a row.

A heads-up for those looking to stay spoiler-free ahead of the launch of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom: it looks like the art book as leaked online.
Over the weekend, over 200 pages of what looks to be The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom art book leaked online and seeped through various channels. We won't be sharing any links or posting any of the leak here, though we've taken a look ourselves to verify its existence.
Without divulging any details, it does look like the art book for the upcoming Breath of the Wild sequel. And the nice part is, from a cursory scan, nothing jumped out as an obvious spoiler. Still, it's worth being aware that this info is out there, in case you want to go into Tears of the Kingdom as fresh as possible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYZuiFDQwQw
Art of the kingdom
It's especially interesting that an art book would leak so far ahead of the release date. We're still a ways out from Tears of the Kingdom's release date of May 12, 2023. This art book is part of what's included in the collector's edition of the game. It is strange that so much info would make it out from the book, three months ahead of time.
Still, fans are likely hungry for more information, as it feels like we don't know a ton about this new Zelda. Points like the main antagonist, or the reason why Hyrule is now home to so many floating islands, are all still theories at this time. I'm sure fans are likely to pick this Zelda art book apart looking for any info on what could be arriving in May.
In the meantime, rev up those muted keywords and hashtags if you're looking to avoid all of it. The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom arrives on May 12, 2023.

Metroid Prime has long been considered one of the crowning achievements of Nintendo’s GameCube library. The series’ seamless transition to the first-person genre was defined by its frenetic action, massively explorable environments, clever puzzles, and daunting boss encounters. However, the subsequent two decades have worn on the original release, but much like Samus by the end of each game, Metroid Prime Remastered brings the title back to full power.

The Horizon series came out of nowhere when it was announced, and now it's sort of synonymous with Sony's entire IP stable, alongside of juggernauts like God of War and The Last of Us. It turns out people really like robot dinosaurs, amid all of the other (sometimes silly) lore therein. It's fun to explore and experience this wild universe in a traditional third person format; but now we have a VR option in Horizon Call of the Mountain.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After the mud and forests of Normandy, and the grim, snowy climes of the Eastern Front, Company Of Heroes 3 feels like World War II on its summer holiday. With two campaigns spanning each side of the sunny Mediterranean, this is arguably Relic's breeziest and most colourful theatre of war yet, evoking the same kind of swagger and gung ho optimism as a Hollywood action flick. It's a feeling that might seem out of place given the current climate, especially now, just days away from the first anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. But while your main objective is always one of domination, gradually turning the map from red to blue on both a micro and macro scale, this is ultimately a game about searing comebacks - of beating back seemingly impossible aggressors, and finding hope where previously there was only despair. I think we could all do with a bit of that in this day and age, even if the battles before you end up feeling like nothing more than the digital equivalent of plonking down a big box of toy soldiers on your living room floor and going daka-daka-daka as they all fall over.

Roughly a year after launching Chrono Cross: The Radical Dreamers Edition, Square-Enix has circled back to address some of its glaring issues with a patch this month. The patch is expected to address issues relating to the title's frame rate, tweak the growth system for Pip, and fix numerous bugs.
Chrono Cross was the anticipated sequel to the SNES classic, Chrono Trigger. It was extremely well-received at its time of release but has since developed a reputation as “not Chrono Trigger” (source: my old college friends). When Chrono Cross: The Radical Dreamers Edition eventually hit the scene, I found the game to be decent, but not one of Square’s best PS1 titles.

That’s fine. It’s still a worthwhile game, especially if you love Square’s PS1-era RPGs. This recent port, however, I found to be kind of stinky, although that’s not what I actually said. My sentiment was more along the lines that it was a barebones port that was serviceable but had framerate issues that made it feel like it failed to reach my bare minimum expectations. Hopefully, this patch will bring the port up to more acceptable standards.
Chrono Cross: The Radical Dreamers Edition is available now on Switch, PS4, Xbox One, and PC. No date was given for the patch.

Sure, it’s a game about death, decay, and loneliness, but it’s told in the most gentle and genuine way possible. Its themes are heavy, but the game could not be more light-hearted. I have no idea how it does it, but Birth is weirdly the most wholesome yet creepy game I've ever played.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The release of the Pinocchio-inspired Soulslike Lies of P has been narrowed down to this August. A new story trailer introduces a seemingly villainous character, Simon, while highlighting some of the dangerous monstrosities waiting to dismantle players. 
Lies of P unfolds in the fictional, Belle Époque-era French city of Krat as players control Pinocchio, a mechanoid puppet on a quest to become human. A certain Mr. Geppetto might be able to help with that, but Krat has been overtaken by sinister creatures Pinocchio must cut down using his multi-purpose mechanical arm. 


The gameplay takes heavy cues from From Software’s work – Bloodborne in particular – as players take down enemies with deliberate sword attacks, while various mechanical arms grant abilities like firing lightning bolts or a grappling hook to reel in targets. Outside of battles, sidequests present the option of lying to characters, and the truthfulness of your answers alters the direction of these stories. 
Lies of P will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S (including Game Pass), and PC. You can learn more by reading our hands-on preview from last year’s Gamescom.]]></summary>

I imagine you've experienced a similar thing with video games, whenever a columnist for a broadsheet writes about them and you can instantly tell that they have never played one in their whole dahlia-manuring, boot room-having, fox hunt-following life.
Tomorrow, And Tomorrow, And Tomorrow is a book about the decades-long relationship between two people who are game developers. And like the above, it would be impossible to explain to someone who doesn't work in the games industry why a small exchange between the two of them made me absolutely roar with laughter.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Atomic Heart’s long development cycle has provided ample opportunities to show off the power of ray tracing. From an Nvidia tech demo back to in 2019 to an RTX-branded trailer released just last month, this souped-up lighting and reflection tech has been a key piston in propelling the Soviet sci-fi FPS’ hype train. Some slightly awkward news, then: the PC version won’t support ray tracing at launch.
I noticed the lack of ray tracing options in the review build we received last week, and got in touch with the game's press relations team to check if I was missing something, or if they were due to be added via update. The response confirmed that their absence was not an error, and that "the devs will be looking into implementing this post-launch." Well then!

It was formally announced with its very flash animated opening sequence during November's PC Gaming Show Preview stream, but now you, too, can see what it actually looks like in motion with its very first gameplay trailer. Come and have a gander at its spaceship antics - or, if you're like me, just watch the two full seconds of a crew member giving Ham the pig a nice big belly-rub on repeat.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you’re British and you’re old, then you love the ZX Spectrum. (Or the Commodore 64, I suppose, but not both. Never both.) Personally, I’m what they called a “Speccy” kid, and I have carried a deep and profound love of the elderly microcomputer’s cassette tape screeches, colour clash and long, long load times into my adult life, despite the fact that – and please don’t get upset, purists – many of the great Spectrum games don’t hold up in the cold light of the modern day. It’s not that the games are necessarily bad, more that they were tremendous for their time. Still eminently enjoyable, but they require the player to get their head into a certain zone, to put up with what are inarguably quite archaic controls and mechanics. 


Oddly enough, there are some Spectrum games on Steam, thanks to a publisher called Pixel Games. However, with the utmost respect to their output… these are not the kind of games that are going to foster interest in the Speccy amongst modern players. Of course, that may well not be the point, but I’d be a little taken aback if even avowed old-school gamers were going to bother picking up the likes of gardening simulator Pedro, a game that scored 63% in Newsfield’s iconic Crash magazine back in the day, or Sam Stoat: Safebreaker, which did a little better at 68%.

Akka Arrh is a reimagined version of a prototype Atari arcade machine from the ‘80s. Originally scrapped due to a lack of interest, the trailer for the re-release claims that only three cabinets have ever been seen. 40 years later, when Atari reached out to veteran designer Jeff Minter (Tempest 2000, Polybius) to remake one of its games, he chose Akka Arrh. The result is a reimagining of the original concept, fused with Minter’s signature psychedelic visuals and some modern-day improvements. While the game can…]]></summary>

It’s a fascinatingly chaotic medley of ideas, and a rare FPS that lacks even the slightest whiff of battle pass-peddling live serfdom, but those ideas so often fail to gel that it can feel like a game made by several different dev teams. For a shooter set within an alternate history Soviet Union, it could perhaps have used some more central planning.

They all force a little chuckle out of me, but none of them have made me belly laugh like I Am Jesus Christ, a first-person retelling of Christ’s tale from birth, to death, to rebirth.  


I Am Jesus Christ’s genre is slightly murky, although, it almost looks like a giant Skyrim mod complete with unfeeling NPCs, first-person spellcasting, and an open world full of quest markers. The newest trailer shows some of Christ’s cool abilities like walking on water, shooting light beams at Satan, and fishing - which is incidentally what I’m looking forward to the most. 


In fairness, the Christ sim looks like a pretty robust and thorough retelling of his journey, depicting scenes like the Last Supper, only this time all the disciples have exclamation marks above their heads. The Steam page also details 30 different miracles (or spells) and a number of different areas to explore.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Like all good fairytale characters, Pinocchio gets a revision every couple of years - except for 2022, when he was adapted thrice (mostly in bad films, except for the Del Toro one). The loveable puppet isn’t waiting too long for his next comeback, as the RPG Soulslike Lies Of P is coming to PC and Game Pass in August. 


Lies Of P’s newest trailer is mostly a black screen with a lot of VO, but we get a clear look at Pinocchio's daddy Master Gepetto this time. The trailer follows a blob wobbling through very Victorian streets before it slides into some automation and uses the machine’s body as a puppet. The result is a boss-sized monstrosity that sits halfway between Lovecraftian horror and industrial defect. It also reminds me of Gears 5’s weird infected robots, with tentacles and slime hanging off their metallic arms - equally gross and cool.


The newest trailer doesn’t show off any Bloodborne-style combat, but we’ve had plenty of looks at that already, including a fight with a gorilla robocop. This Soulslike looks just as aggressive as you’d expect, emphasising quick dodge rolls and last-minute, anxiety-fueled parries. Pinocchio’s arm doubles up as a grappling hook to pull enemies in, which is always cool in a hack n’ slasher, and makes even more sense when you’re playing as a puppet. Also, is it just me or is Pinocchio pretty this time around?

For those who wish to try something new, the developers of Dyschronia: Chronos Alternate at MyDearest want to help you with a chance to win your choice of a PlayStation 5 Digital Edition, a Nintendo Switch OLED, or a Meta Quest 2 (128 GB).
Dyschronia: Chronos Alternate takes place in the city of Astrum Close where the crime rate is only 0.001%. Protagonist Hal Scion is a young investigator who possesses a special ability called “Memory Dive” that allows him to see into and alter the past and he uses this ability to collect evidence for investigations. When the founder of Astrum Close is found dead, Hal must take up the case in order to solve this theoretically “impossible” murder. The game is currently available on the Meta Quest 2, is launching on PlayStation VR2 on February 22nd, and launches on Nintendo Switch later this year.
One lucky winner can choose between a PlayStation 5 Digital Edition, a Nintendo Switch OLED, or a Meta Quest 2 (128 GB) to jumpstart their journey into the cyber-noir anime world of Dyschronia: Chronos Alternate.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Super Replay gets injected with a terrifying dose of dino-DNA as we tackle Capcom's most underrated game, Dino Crisis! Join us today on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central as we play the 1999 "panic horror" game from start to finish for two hours each week. Each episode will be uploaded to our Game Informer Shows YouTube channel the next day after airing. 
Episode 1 - Death Finds A Way
Episode 2 - In Defense of The Lost World
Episode 3 - Terror Dactyl 
After the success of Resident Evil, Capcom followed it up with a spiritual successor called Dino Crisis. The title follows a similar blueprint to Resident Evil but ditches zombies in favor of blood-thirsty dinosaurs. The game stars Regina, a special ops soldier sent with a team to investigate an island research facility that has been taken over by these prehistoric lizards. Join host Marcus Stewart with Kyle Hilliard on the sticks as the pair get to the bottom of whatever the heck is happening on this island and blast these critters back to extinction.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Quickplay strategy games have always been a thing, but they appear to be gaining in popularity lately. I will probably regret not keeping Ozymandias aside for the traditional "summer strategy game for when your brain is a gas" bit, but the scene is looking healthy enough to chance it.
You know that cliché feeling of "just one more turn"? Ozymandias is a bronze age 4X that builds momentum enough to turn that into "just one more game". It is incredibly easy to learn, and despite looking a little dry and number heavy, becomes more effortless, more pleasant the longer you play. It also becomes more clear how much depth there is hidden away in such a light design. It's about proving yourself the most prestigious civilisation, not through total conquest, but by exploiting the lay of the land, and leaning into your strengths.

Through some quirk of bloodline or destiny, wizards can access impossible forces simply by saying magic words. This does not engender caution. A wizard's not a real wizard until they have accidentally set themselves on fire or unleashed an ancient evil. And if you throw four of this dim demigods together? Well, you get the co-op wizard action of the Magicka games, where freestyling elemental combinations can (and often will) lead you to heal a boss or torch your pal's face. Splendid chaos.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jake Solomon, the director of Marvel’s Midnight Suns and the modern XCOM games, has announced his departure from Firaxis. 
Solomon has worked at Firaxis for 23 years and is best known as the lead designer of XCOM: Enemy Unknown and the director of XCOM 2, including its War of the Chosen expansion. He most recently directed Marvel’s Midnight Suns. 
In a statement posted to Twitter, Solomon doesn’t state a specific reason for his resignation but does tease his next project by stating, “My brain is on fire with a new dream. Time to go chase it.” Whether or not this dream keeps him in the game industry is a mystery for now. You can read his full statement below.
Some of our favorite memories of Jake’s time at Firaxis include this funny video of him visiting a game store to convince shoppers to buy XCOM 1. He was also a great sport on our Marvel’s Midnight Suns Rapid-Fire interview. You can read our review of his final project at Firaxis, Marvel's Midnight Suns, here.]]></summary>

Late last year, turn-based indie RPG The Outbound Ghost was delisted from Steam after a statement from lead dev Conrad Grindheim claimed his relationship with publisher Digerati had “dissolved.” Soon after, Digerati filed a lawsuit against developer Conradical over a breach of contract and “several false defamatory” statements. When reporting on the original news, CJ thought the messy situation could get messier, and he was right. Grindheim has now DMCA’d his own game on console storefronts and accused Digerati of withholding royalties.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am legendary ronin Sakomoto Ryoma. I shout "yosh!" as I harvest six (6) gleaming radishes from my allotment. I shoot a bandit in the head with a revolver. I send my adoptive daughter to trade some homemade pickles. I partake in a brooding chat, then stamp on a dude's head. I help a recluse regain his confidence. I have totally forgotten what I was meant to be doing.
Like A Dragon: Ishin feels like a step backward, but in a brilliant way. Kiryu and co. may have moved onto a turn-based future, yet Sakomoto Ryoma and his pals have turned back the clock to an Edo period of brawlin' and chicken betting that's most reminiscent of Yakuza 0, only it's not the roaring 80s but the bloody 1800s. There's nothing here that will convert those who aren't keen on the series, but if you're an ardent fan or a newcomer eager to experience its wild swings between serious and silly, Ishin is an excellent place to start.

And yet, despite the age of its skeleton, in some ways, the game stands out as one of the more impressive games in developer Ryu Ga Gotoku's (RGG) portfolio – even with a few noticeable weak points. 
Ishin takes place in the 1860s, at the end of Japan's Edo period. You play as Sakamoto Ryoma – a real-life historical figure – who, amid his own revenge scheme, finds himself embroiled in the …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tetris is a new original film coming to Apple TV+, the iPhone maker's streaming service, and if the first trailer for it is any indication, it looks like a great time. 
Released yesterday, Tetris begins with the classic Europe song, "The Final Countdown," which then aptly transitions to Korobeiniki, the main theme of Tetris (you know the one). The trailer then showcases how Taron Egerton's character is deadset on bringing Tetris to everybody after playing it once. Unable to get falling tetrominos out of his head, Egerton's character heads to the Soviet Union to convince the game's creator that he can make him a millionaire. 
Check it out for yourself in the Apple TV+ Tetris trailer below: 


As you can see, Tetris looks great – funny, suspenseful, dramatic, and a seemingly great retelling of how the "greatest game ever made" made its way to our hands via the NES and Game Boy. 
Tetris is directed by Jon S. Baird and written by Noah Pink. It begins streaming on Apple TV+ on March 31. 
Are you going to check Tetris out next month? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

It's a wrestling dating sim with a splash of RPG, and almost certainly a game that'll pin your heart in a bear hug and never let go.

That's Octopath Traveler 2 in a nutshell, a JRPG that follows so precisely in the footsteps of its predecessor that you'd be forgiven for thinking it was suddenly 2019 again and that the last few pandemic years were nothing but a terrible existential nightmare. But alas, here we are in 2023 with another Octopath Traveler game that is, bar a couple of very light tweaks and additions, exactly the same game as what came before it, for better and for worse.

In an age where remakes and retro-inspired projects try recreating what classic games of old felt like, Octopath Traveler II accomplishes something impressive. Despite being rooted in modern design with a host of conveniences, it effortlessly captures the spirit, style, and sense of adventure of the best RPGs from the SNES era, while still innovating and showing there’s life in turn-based battles yet.

It's down to $99.99 for a 1TB model and $159.99 for a 2TB size, a new low price for each capacity and a great deal for our top PCIe 4.0 SSD recommendation. 
This SSD is only really rivalled by the more expensive Samsung 990 Pro, our overall 'fastest SSD' recipient, with both options offering random write performance well over 1M IOPS and sequential read speeds of up to 7300MB/s, at the very limit of the PCIe 4.0 standard.

The trailer shows Eddie Brock, having recovered from the events of the main campaign, making a deal with Mephisto to help rid himself of his darkness. Naturally, this goes about as well as you would expect, leading to Venom joining the Midnight Suns as a playable character to battle this formidable demonic threat. 


Redemption will be available on February 23. It comes included with the game's season pass. Firaxis' role-playing strategy take on the Marvel universe has already received DLC in the form of a Deadpool character and mission pack.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hot diggedy daffodil, am I glad I picked Casual difficulty in Veil Of Dust. Unlike some games, Veil Of Dust doesn't make it sound like any sort of concession; the middle difficulty is called Challenge, and says "it's pretty tough - you've been warned". I took the warning seriously, and thank God, because even the easiest difficulty had me pouring dandelion tea down my brother's throat like he was doing a kegstand (and in the game).
Áine and Shane are a pair of Irish siblings who've moved to Oregon to start a new life, which, in the main story, involves eating potatoes and trying not to get depressed. It's difficult enough that I didn't think I would like it at first, as even basic tasks deplete your stamina and sleeping in your 1860s hovel with a hole in the roof doesn't restore very much per night. Áine can do spells, but they're simple and only really take the edge off what is a very hard life. Magic isn't a cure-all in Veil Of Dust, and using it has to be weighed up, just like everything else.

In the... uh, semi-heady fog of 2019 came the news that it was getting a remake, and I was muchly excited, for in the interim I'd actually learned the original existed and how good and somehow unrivalled it still was. And finally, in the slight damp of late 2022, that remake arrived. It is a remarkably faithful remake, to a degree I may not ever have seen for such an old game. Some details and flourishes aside, it's basically the same design, with all the same parts.

Coincidentally, I've also finally got into Total Warhammer lately, and spent some time reacquainting myself with Warlords Battlecry, and in between building city walls and crushing stupid aryan elfs, I've realised what truly connects all three: balance. They all, correctly, reject it.

As horrific as the game looks, it's the soundtrack and creepy sound effects that do much of the heavy lifting in building fear and tension. To understand how the remake remixes and enhances the original game's soundscape, I picked the brains of RE4 sound director Hiroshi Tamura and lead composer Kota Suzuki to learn how they're making the game sound as good as it plays. 
Game Informer: A goal for the Resident Evil 4 remake is to create more believable soundscapes. Can you discuss what that means, with examples, and why that's important to the team?

Wild Hearts may seem similar to Monster Hunter and other hunting genre games, but its focus on constructing gadgets in a world steeped in Japanese folklore and feudal-era Japan help it carve its own identity. Like Monster Hunter, you track big game, craft new armor and weapons, and do it all over again. But the otherworldly take on old-world Japan, filled with giant mythical beasts, is a profo…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s the dead of night. I’m in my little tugboat out on open waters. I can barely see three feet in front of my nose because of the thick blanket of fog, but I'm trying my hand at night fishing, hoping to hook something really good. I find a squid spot and start to fish, reeling in one or two fine-looking catches. The third one, however, is monstrous, a mess of jagged teeth and sickly pale flesh. Yes, this should make for a fine amount of cash. The more morbid it is, the more money I get. Suddenly there’s a deep rumbling in the ocean and panic starts to creep in. I chuck my prize into my cargo and speed back to town, the phrase ‘fuck round, find out’ circling my brain.
I’ve not been playing Dredge long, but I’m calling it one of my favourite games of the year, right now, in February. Black Salt Games' sinister fishing RPG is gripping and enchanting in a way I didn’t anticipate. I’ve spent hours exploring its murky waters and my constant shock at what unsettling creatures my hook brings in is seemingly never-ending. Its eldritch world keeps pulling me back with its mystery and malevolent horror, and its sense of atmosphere and tension is incredible. Basically, I'm completely enraptured, hook, line, sinker. Dredge already feels like one of this year’s greatest indie horrors and all this, from a fishing game of all things.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While the other major publishers like Microsoft and Nintendo have only dabbled with virtual reality, Sony is the only one of the big three that seems to consider it a potential avenue for our video game future. The original PlayStation VR, from the outside at least, seemed like a moderate success for Sony. It was a functional VR alternative for players who were not interested in entering the world of PC gaming and it had at least one undeniable, exclusive hit with Astro Bot Rescue Mission.
PlayStation VR2 is the next logical step for the sub-platform. It works with Sony’s latest hardware, it improves on basically every aspect of PlayStation VR, but it’s not quite the virtual reality revolution I feel like we’ve been waiting for since the advent of the medium.

Call of the Mountain is meant to be PlayStation VR2’s showcase piece, and in some important ways, it functions as exactly that. Firing off an arrow with a bow in VR feels great, and getting a chance to see the world of Horizon from a novel perspective can be exhilarating. The primary gameplay of Call of the Mountain, however, struggles to find fun at a basic level which ultimately sours the larger experience.

I’ve put together this settings guide – based on the game’s early trial build – for those who want to join the hunt pronto, but above all else my advice is to wait until developers Omega Force get the promised performance improvements up and running.

I can't help but feel active reload didn't get a fair shake because so few games do it outside Gears Of War, but the results are science and we must continue. This week, I suppose our choices are both about architecture, but in very different ways. What's better: funicular fights or elaborate corridor architecture?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've never had much of a desire for "I'm attending school" sims, because I hated attending school and not having to do it is one of the prime benefits of growing out of your teens. Running a school though? That's a challenge I don't mind taking on. Twopoint Campus does a great plate-spinning take on a school admin sim, but if you want something with cards, a dark lord, and the option for organic school meals, then... well, then you're making a very specific request. But it's one I can fulfil with Spellcaster University. And it's bloody difficult.

Like previous Playstation port Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered, it’s not the most easygoing game either, but I’ve cycled through my share of deaths and rebirths and can report that Returnal will make do with older graphics cards and middling RAM counts. It’s a mostly well-considered porting job too, with optional ray tracing, various upscaling tools, ultrawide support for 21:9 and 32:9 monitors, and pages upon pages of customisable display and control settings.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The last thing you need when you’ve just crash-landed on an unknown planet teeming with predatory wildlife is to discover you’re also stuck in a time loop. But that’s the fate of deep-space astronaut Selene in Returnal, when she ditches her single-seater vessel on a remote rock called Atropos. Each time she falls foul of the local fauna, she pops back into existence right next to her broken ship, with no obvious means of escape. Forget Aliens vs Predator, this is Aliens vs Groundhog Day.
But what a day it is, as Returnal combines a best-in-class third-person shooter with a deep dive into the psychology of its protagonist. Selene’s journey into Atropos, through a thick jungle, a burning vermilion desert and beyond, sends her circling through a smorgasbord of emotions – from confusion to hope, despair to determination. And so often, her mood dovetails with your own highs and lows of elation and frustration, until every part of Returnal encases you in its loop.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Riot Games released a promotional video this morning revealing its plans to release three League of Legends spin-off games this year. Two of these titles, Song of Nunu and Convergence, had been previously announced, while the third game, The Mageseeker, makes it debut. 


The Mageseeker is set to arrive first sometime this spring. Developed by Digital Sun, the team behind Moonlighter, it’s described as a gritty 2D action RPG. It stars Sylas and takes place in Demacia. You can find The Mageseeker on PC and unspecified consoles. 
Convergence launches this summer and was first revealed at The Game Awards in 2019. Starring Ekko, it’s a 2D action-platforming adventure by Double Stallion that features parkour and time-manipulation mechanics. Convergence launches for PlayStation and Xbox consoles, Switch, and PC via Steam and Epic. 
Song of Nunu closes out the year. Releasing this fall, it centers on the young Nunu and his yeti partner Willump on a search to find Nunu’s mother. The charming adventure game focuses on the pair working together to solve environmental puzzles. Song of Nunu comes from the folks at Tequila Works, the developer of titles such as Rime and Gylt, and it will be available on PlayStation and Xbox consoles, Switch, and PC via Steam and Epic. 
Riot released its first League of Legends spin-off Ruined King in 2021 to generally positive reviews, so we're curious to see how these other projects fair and if they'll attract new, non-MOBA fans coming off Netflix's well-received Arcane series. Which League of Legends title are you most interested in?

Through The Nightmares may not be about spellcasting and amateur alchemy, but it still draws upon the arcane and otherworldly, setting its deviously difficult action-platforming inside the sleepscapes of frightened children.
You are the Sandman, and you are neither sprinkling happy dust on Danish eyelids nor delivering Liberace-haired boyfriends to vocal quartets. Instead, you’re an active fighter of nightmares, diving into the brains of restless kids to explore their most traumatic memories and, ultimately, defeat the monstrous embodiments of their fears.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Loathe as I am to become one of those "want to feel old?" types of posters, this review requires me to point out that the original Pharaoh came out in 1999, almost 25 years ago. It was one of that era's City Building series that included Zeus and all of the Caesars, a run of games so good that they earned the capital letters. Pharaoh also happens to be one of my foundational video games, and I played it when I was knee-high to my big brother's desk, at a time when family homes had one (1) yellow-grey computer with a CRT screen. And now it's back, baby.
Pharaoh: A New Era means I can play that game of my childhood on my shiny black RGB-lit bastard. Honestly though, the "A New Era" part is a bit much. Sure, the updated graphics are fabulous and the quality of life changes mean it plays like smooth peanut butter to the 90s' extra crunchy. It's a good remake of a solid game, but the mummy in the casket is fundamentally the same.

Yes, they're cheap per gigabyte, yes they're fairly reliable, yes they're absolutely the way to go if you need to store a lot of data and don't care how long it takes to access it. But. But. These drives are hard to go back to after you're used to SSDs, with their near-instant access times, completely silent operation, resistance to shocks, drops and magnets and of course their overall SPEED. 
So when I had the chance, I bought the biggest SSD I could afford, a 4TB model at the time, and copied literally every bit of data from the four or five 1TB or smaller hard drives that I'd bought over the years and stuck into my increasingly full PC tower. It was expensive, and it took ages to copy everything across, but as soon as I turned my computer on for the first time and I didn't have to listen to the clicks and whirs of a mechanical drive, I was completely convinced I'd made the right call to ditch spinning rust.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Terra Nil is terraforming sim, in which you land on a barren wasteland, construct machines for restoring it to a lush, green wilderness, and then pack up your toys and leave. It's one of the games I'm most looking forward to in 2023, and its latest trailer just cements that. It's three-minutes-long, has no music, and simply lets you revel in the "satisfaction in reclamation".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: if there’s a cute animal game that looks like it’s going to make me cry, then sign me up, I’m ready to go. In fairness, though, co-op adventure Blanc looks like it's going to be a lot lighter than games like Endling: Extinction is Forever and the notoriously upsetting Shelter series at first glance, but I’ve learned to never let my guard down around these kinds of games. Those cute art styles are almost always a front for a brutal sneak attack on your emotions.
Blanc is very much aiming for your heartstrings with its adorable animal duo and picturesque snowy landscapes. The first half teases massive potential for a cutesy story with fun puzzle antics, but the game is majorly let down by a repetitive and often frustrating second half and lacklustre ending. After the promise of a warm, cosy adventure, I watched the end credits roll and couldn't help feeling like I'd been left out in the cold.

At the end of each evening, you can privately ask one of your friends to hang out the next day 1 on 1, getting to know them better and just doing cool witch shit.

The first-person archaeology game was put on hold in 2019 after Valve acquired Campo Santo and had them support other Valve projects like Half-Life: Alyx. Now Campo's in-limbo game has a December 2029 listing on Steam, which almost certainly means nothing, but it’s fun to dust off some memories.

The big surprise this season is the Valentine’s themed Loverwatch, a non-canon text adventure that allows you to court either Mercy or Genji. Naturally, I chose to date Genji (described as Overwatch’s “bad boy”), and the results were surprising. It’s cringe-y and occasionally grating, but it’s also surprisingly charming and stuffed with referential humour that OW fans will surely love.

It also looks absolutely gorgeous, channelling Ico and the rest of Fumito Ueda's oeuvre in all the right ways.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I think Wanted: Dead wants to be a singleplayer, third-person action game with kickass combat and a colourful cyberpunk universe that slides effortlessly between gritty and silly. And I'm guessing it wants players to experience the joys of shredding goons, and a story told through unpredictable cuts to karaoke and anime. I'm sad to report that it isn't any of these things. Aside from the tiniest glimpses of cool when a combo comes together, the game clearly doesn't know what it wants to be, or if it did once upon a time, its original vision must've gotten lost under a dogpile of ideas. I rooted for it when I first saw it way back when, and got excited when I heard it was being made by devs behind Ninja Gaiden and Dead or Alive, but what's arrived is a jumbled mess that fights you at every turn. If I were Debra Meadon playing it for the first time live on Dragon's Den, and someone sidled up behind me and pressed a katana to my throat, I would still carefully put the controller down and say, "It's a no from me".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Magic is weird. And, since an Ordinary (non-magical person) suddenly getting magic is also deemed weird in Ikenfell, it stands to reason that it’s practically guaranteed to happen. We can only assume the odds become even higher as the Ordinary ventures closer to the big magical fantasy school, which protagonist Maritte quickly discovers. Upon approaching the gate in search of her missing sister, Safina, Maritte suddenly starts to sling fiery spells.
Those new spells certainly come in handy, as Maritte finds herself fired up (hehe, geddit?) and ready to fight through this Paper Mario-style tactical RPG. Along with some of Saf’s old friends, you explore the titular school and surrounding areas, searching for clues that might help unravel the mystery. Ikenfell has challenging combat and lots of little secrets hidden in its 8-bit world, but it’s the loveable bunch of pals (both allies and rivals) that really made me smile. Oh, and some of them have killer theme tunes that I can’t stop singing.

You can visit the website here, which features a commercial promoting the Mario Bros. business. Older fans will likely recognize the catchy jingle as the theme song of the 1989 Super Mario Brothers Super Show, which is a nice homage. 


The website also features humorous testimonials, job opportunities, and even a working phone number. Calling this number (929-55-MARIO) plays a recorded message by the Charlie Day-voiced Luigi, which provides a nice sample of his performance as the green-clad sidekick. Texting the number returns a message, which, depending on when you sent it, may return a digital poster for the movie. GI editor Kyle Hilliard got this Toad poster when he texted the number yesterday:
In my case, I only got a message thanking me for my interest in Super Mario Bros. Plumbing with a link to a form submission on the website. I'm not sure what you get for submitting this form, but feel free to find out yourselves. 
The Super Mario Bros. Movie premieres in theaters on April 7. You can check out the official movie poster here. Watch the latest trailer featuring Donkey Kong and Cat Suit Mario here.]]></summary>

But today, the game’s official Twitter announced the zombie slasher had gone gold and would be arriving a week early on April 21st, breaking the decade-long tradition of delay-related news.

This makes it a good opportunity to pick up (often barely) used gear, like headsets, external drives, mice and keyboards, especially higher-end stuff that would otherwise be out of reach.

Later Alligator is one such game I picked up for that very reason as the goofy gators in the game’s trailer and screenshots initially caught my attention. The animation is great for sure, but one thing I was not expecting is how funny and utterly charming this point-and-click adventure is.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Too many spells in games are just variations on the old reliable fireball. Wizard sends projectile towards target. Target dies. Perhaps they deviate a little in how quickly they die, or how large the area of effect is. Maybe instead of a fireball it's a thunderbolt, or a poisonous gas, or a beam of light. Pish, I say. Pish! Where's the real magic? Where are the cataclysmic spells that take days or weeks of preparation, and then change the world with a single fateful ritual?
These games could learn something from The Last Spell, a roguelite turn-based tactics game about defending your village each night from hordes of mutant beasts that emerge from the purple fog surrounding the entire world. Whenever I start a new game in The Last Spell, I always rewatch the excellent opening sequence, which succinctly sets a harrowing scene of magic pushed further than we're used to seeing in most fiction in general, let alone games.

Blizzard had already announced that this battle pass would have in-game currency for the first time, allowing players to buy their choice of cosmetics, rather than just the passes’ selection of skins and souvenirs. But fans on Reddit have accused Blizzard of deliberately misleading players with these rewards.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dead Island 2 has been in development hell for years, and the fans eagerly awaiting its launch now have one less week to do so. Dambuster Studios has announced it’s bumping the game’s release from April 28 to April 21.
The news came in an announcement tweet declaring the game has gone gold, meaning it's essentially complete and ready to be printed on discs. Dead Island 2 had previously been scheduled to launch on February 3 before it was delayed to April 28. Speaking of April 28, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor was recently pushed to that same day. It wouldn't be surprising if Dambuster moved its launch forward to steer clear of Star Wars' blast radius. 
You asked for it, you got it. Dead Island 2 went gold and it's coming out a week early.

For six hours, you do this, and eat your dinner feeling sick with unrealised potential.
Match-3 games are compulsive for a reason, and I don't have beef with them as a concept. I actually like them! But I don't like that to play a match-3 game I usually have to play a mobile game that wants me to spent money on Fairy Dollars so I can buy barrels of Explosive Wand Dust, making it easier to earn stars and incrementally furnish the Magic Toilet Goblin's bedroom, or whatever. It's the empty consumerism vibe of freemium mobile games that makes me feel like I've been eating the time-spending equivalent of junk food. Spirit Swap, which has a demo out now in the form of an endless mode, isn't that. It's beautiful, difficult, customiseable, and it'll swallow you time in a good way, not a faintly unsettling one.

Best of all, you can watch every episode right now. 
The series, called PsychOdyssey, consists of a whopping 32 episodes, all of which are available to watch for free on Double Fine’s YouTube channel. Double Fine Adventure! earned praise for its raw, intimate look at the good, bad, and ugly sides of game development as the crew spent years filming in Double Fine's studio as Broken Age came together. Psychonauts 2's tumultous road to release, from crowdfunding campaigns to Microsoft's acquistion of Double Fine, makes its creation a fascinating subject, and we're excited to see how 2 Player Productions captured it.

Capturing the essence of an established fiction is tricky business, especially when translating into a new medium. It’s a big reason licensed games frequently miss the mark, sometimes failing to find the tone and nuance that made the original version shine. Avalanche Software navigates those challenges with a deft eye and an evident appreciation for the source books and films. Hogwarts Legacy…]]></summary>

The reveal of Pacific Drive last year immediately grabbed me. I liked what I saw in the initial trailer, sure, but what I found especially intriguing was that most of the game happens through a first-person view of someone driving an old station wagon through a beautiful but distraught Pacific Northwest forest. Rarely do driving games force a first-person view, and even fewer deviate from being a racer. 
Pacific Drive does both, and after viewing roughly 30 minutes of gameplay during a virtual preview, I’m even more intrigued. In a way, Pacific Drive is a racing game, but you’re not racing against other players – you’re racing against a biome ravaged by a mysterious sci-fi force that controls anomalies set on…]]></summary>

On the reasoning for the $69.99 price tag for The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom:
On if this is the trend for Nintendo titles going forward:
Original Story (Published at 5:49 pm Central on February 8, 2023)
The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom could very well be the most anticipated game of 2023 and is certainly one of the most exciting releases in the history of the Nintendo Switch. During today's Nintendo Direct, we got a new look at gameplay, plus the announcement of the Collector's Edition and a new Amiibo figure starring Link. However, we also got some unfortunate news surrounding the upcoming launch of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.
In its press release for the Nintendo Direct, Nintendo announced that the upcoming Zelda entry will retail for $69.99. This makes Nintendo the latest major publish to test the waters of raising the price of its triple-A titles in recent years. This follows other major publishers like 2K Games and PlayStation, who started pricing their major releases at $70 with the start of the new console generation in 2020. Last year, both Xbox and Ubisoft announced that their triple-A games would cost $70 going forward.
We reached out to Nintendo for comment regarding the reasoning for the price increase and if this will be the trend for its triple-A releases going forward, but did not immediately receive a response. We will update this story if Nintendo provides a statement.
The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom launches on Switch on May 12.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo released a new trailer for The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, which revealed all kinds of new mechanics like rail gliding as well as what appears to be customizable vehicles. You can see the trailer here.
Alongside the trailer, however, Nintendo also released a new batch of official screenshots which features a collection of alternate paragliders alongside other details. The new paragliders are apparently related to the game's amiibo compatibility which according to a press release, "Will also be available separately that grants access to materials and weapons, as well as a special fabric for Link’s paraglider." You can check out some examples in the gallery below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon got its first gameplay showcase after its reveal at the Game Awards last December. This storybook-themed adventures stars a young Bayonetta on a quest to free her imprisoned mother.
Still going by her birth name of Cereza, our hero is still a witch-in-training so she won't be executing flash combos or summoning a litany of demons. Instead, Bayonetta Origins plays more like an adventure game. Along the way, she'll befriend the demon Cheshire who handles all of the fighting. Cerezea lends a hand by magically binding enemies in place using her magic. Outside of combat, the pair combine their powers to overcome platforming obstacles. 


Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon comes to Switch on March 17.]]></summary>

You're going to immediately jump past this paragraph to the trailer below, so here are the quick bits you need to know: there's rail grinding akin to Sonic and Splatoon, a new homing arrow, a big, dumb goofy car Link can drive and a new hoverboard, and all around the game continues to look great. 
Here's the trailer:


While we're at it, here's a whole host of new screenshots. 

Tears of the Kingdom will be released on May 12, 2023.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo has been very robust in its support of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, regularly bringing out new content for enthusiastic racers over the last year to keep the experience fresh. That trend continues with the upcoming Booster Course Pass Wave 4, which is targeting a release later this spring.
While we don’t have all the details, today’s Nintendo Direct gave us a look at the new course set on Yoshi’s Island, which looks just as whimsical and fun as that locale ever has. We also learned that Birdo is joining the roster of available racers – the one-time Mario foe first appeared in a Mario Kart game with Double Dash, and so this appearance is a return to the road.
Subscribers to the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack service are able to access the new Booster Course Pass Wave 4 for no additional cost, but the pass is also available for separate purchase.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Advance Wars 1+2: Re-Boot Camp will be released on April 21, as announced today during the most recent Nintendo Direct live stream. 
Re-Boot Camp has had an uphill battle hitting any release date. Originally announced for a release on December 3, 2021, in October of that year, it was pushed to spring 2022. And then, well, that didn't happen. In March 2022, Nintendo announced an indefinite delay "in light of recent world events," perhaps referencing the war in Ukraine, which had just broken out at that time. 
Check out a trailer below.


Advance Wars 1+2: Re-Boot Camp is a remake of the Game Boy Advance games Advance Wars and Advance Wars 2: Black Hole Rising. It's being developed by WayForward, known for its work on the Shantae series.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Breaking news: OpenTTD 13.0 is now available! Depending on your perspective, we’re either two months early for our usual April 1st release, or a bit tardy for the Christmas 2022 release we intended. We think the wait has been worth it. This is one of the largest releases we’ve done in several years, with numerous features and improvements covering the user interface, gameplay features, and modding extensions for NewGRF and Game Script creators. Some of the highlights are: Variable interface scaling at whatever size you want (not just 2x and 4x), with optional chunky bevels for that retro feel. This includes better automatic scaling when using HiDPI or mixed DPI setups. Direct access to NewGRF/AI/GS settings from the new game window. Various small tweaks and improvements to several windows. NewGRFs can now provide engine variants that are shown hierarchically in the purchase list. Multi-track level crossings to keep road vehicles from stopping in the middle of the crossing. Custom league tables for GameScripts. More natural rivers which get wider as they flow downstream. And much more, which can be seen in the changelog or the previous release announcements! In addition to these features and improvements, we’ve fixed lots of bugs. (If you played with the RC2 testing release, most were fixed before then. See the changelog for full details.)

        <link href="https://www.scummvm.org/news/20230203/"/>
        <updated>2023-02-03T18:07:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few months have passed since we released ScummVM 2.6.1. It's time to prepare for a new release!
Our lovely developers added support, yet again, for a bunch of new ancient games that require testing:
Soldier Boyz
GLK Scott Adams Interactive Fiction games (C64 and ZX Spectrum)
GLK Scott Adams adventures 1-12 (TI99/4A format)
Obsidian
Pink Panther: Passport to Peril
Pink Panther: Hokus Pokus Pink
Driller/Space Station Oblivion
Halls of the Dead: Faery Tale Adventure II
Besides these games, we’d appreciate it if you could check our release testing list. Maybe you’ll even find your favorite game on there that has been sitting on that shelf for way too long - otherwise, there are some demos of these games available on our website.
And since ScummVM is about playing games in general, we’ve seen notable changes across many, many engines - so this is the perfect time for giving your favorites another go.
As usual, we are not just adding support for new games. We are constantly working on improving the engines we already support and, in particular, we’ve seen some incredible work being done on the SCUMM engine. Yes, there are the usual bug fixes, but this time we are also adding a feature that helps playing the SCUMM games in a truly original fashion: Support for the original loading and saving dialogs within the GUI!
Speaking of truly original: Remember those old CRT displays we had back in the day? With ScummVM 2.7.0 you’ll be able to replicate this experience on certain platforms thanks to our new shader-based scalers. Go ahead and give it a try!
All testing must be done with stable builds, not development ones. Please report any bugs or oddities on our issue tracker.
A detailed list of all exciting new features and fixes is available in our NEWS file.
Thank you very much for your support! Let’s make ScummVM 2.7.0 a great release - together!
