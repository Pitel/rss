        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cog-nitive.
In games, we often talk about ‘levels’ and ‘levelling up’. Promenade takes that to the – ahem – next level. France-based Holy Cap Studios and Red Art Games bring us this 2D puzzle-platformer collectathon that connects a mix of lands via a Great Elevator. Inspired by other titles, it may not be the most original, but true to its name (French for ‘ride’), it’s a pleasure to play — for the most part.
Promenade opens with your character, Nemo, getting lost (don’t). He’s less the Pixar fish and more Finn the Human. You fall from a great height to somewhere underground, where a little ‘poulp’ (which we just learned is another word for octopus, from the French poulpe) saves your life. A wholesome montage shows you making a home, before the day you decide to embark on the big wide world together.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A number of people would have been disappointed to learn that Epic changed its mind about offering the retro Fallout games for free via its store. However, some good news is on the horizon, as the company will launch them as part of its storefront giveaways. Just not yet.


According to a recent report from IGN, Epic has been in touch with the publication to say the classic Fallout releases will be up for grabs "later this year." A spokesperson confirmed that the first two games plus Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of Steel will be included.

The original plan was to have all three available on Epic Games Store between February 22 and February 29. However, it was quietly pulled, being replaced by Super Meat Boy.


Some love is needed for these cult hits


It's a bit of a shame we don't exactly know when they'll be available for free. All we know is that it'll be sometime this year. At least it's happening at all, given that fans had the rug pulled out from underneath them recently.


There's a good chance a lot of people reading this have only experienced Fallout 3 and beyond. When Bethesda took over the franchise for the 2008 installment, the series went from having more of a cult status on PC to being a mainstream, AAA release.


As and when the older games do become free on Epic Games Store, I would urge you to try them out. They're a different beast to the Bethesda entries, but it will give you a greater appreciation of just what Fallout used to be like.

You can watch the event at 06:00 AM PST on the official Pokemon YouTube channel (which I recommend keeping an eye on for all Pokemon-related news whether it be for the video games or TCG). The event is being held to celebrate Pokemon Day which commemorates the launch of the first games in Japan in 1996. Hence, it's not unusual for the franchise to have a Pokemon Presents come our way on this date.   




What to expect


There have been rumors circulating regarding a potential Pokemon Presents and the new titles it might announce. However, we have no official information on what to expect just yet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Every year, there are a couple of game soundtracks I become properly obsessed with. In 2022, I more or less had the music of Tunic and Citizen Sleeper on repeat whenever I left the house. In 2021, it was Chicory. In 2020, it was Coffee Talk and Signs Of The Sojourner, and in 2019, it was all Mutazione, all the time. 2023 was a pretty great year for game music as well, as we not only got Alan Wake 2's exquisite musical set-piece that's honestly just been getting better and more insane as time's gone on, frankly, but also the toe-tappingly brilliant soundtrack of Cobalt Core, which has somehow risen even higher on my forever playlist after revisiting it for this month's RPS Game Club.  
Composed by Aaron Cherof, Cobalt Core's music alternates between high-energy battle tracks and calmer, more relaxed ambience. It's so dang good, and an absolutely perfect backdrop for sliding in and out of oncoming missile fire in its roguelike spaceship fights. So come along and jam to some of its best tracks with me below as I pick out some of my musical highlights.

Fitting for a game that our Rogue Trader review called "engrossing, obscure and absolutely exhausting". It adds loads of new voiced lines, fixes everything from wonky abilities to broken quests, reworks balance, improves performance, and so much more. Enough is changed that developers Owlcat are giving everyone in your party a free respec to adjust to what the game has become.

It has been 25 years since Pokémon Red and Blue was released in North America. In fact, it has been 25 years and five months, but in the spirit of 'better late than never,' TIME has decided to get in on the action with a new special edition of the magazine.
Ahead of Pokémon Day 2024 (and the Pokémon Presents showcase therein) on 27th February, the iconic magazine company has unleashed four special edition covers, each depicting a different one of the OG starters or Pikachu — because Pikachu has to be there, right?

Out today for PC at 12pm UTC, 1pm GMT, 7am ET and 4am PT, the 1.07 patch adds Full Synchronization Challenge, a permadeath mode (originally teased last year) that not only permakills you when you're slain by enemies, but also deletes your save file when you commit crimes such as slaughtering civilians, or going outside of "authorised map locations".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo will air a Partner Showcase of its Direct videos this week on Wednesday, February 21. Unlike a traditional Direct, Partner Showcases are presentations that highlight upcoming third-party games for Switch.
The Direct will air at 6 a.m. Pacific/9 a.m. Eastern on YouTube and will run for 25 minutes. Nintendo states in a press release that it will showcase “Nintendo Switch games coming in the first half of 2024 from our publishing and development partners.”
Ignoring the faint voice in my head whispering, “Hollow Knight: Silksong”, these are some noteworthy games with actual confirmed release dates within that window that could appear:
Inkulinati
Unicorn Overlord
Gylt
Highwater
South Park: Snow Day!
Open Roads
Botany Manor
Tales of Kenzera: Zau
SaGa Emerald Beyond
Braid: Anniversary Collection
Numerous third-party games slated for 2024 lack release dates, so there’s always a chance some of those could get launch windows or new trailers, at least. Some big ones include Contra: Operation Galuga, Decapolice, the long-awaited Switch port of Kingdom Come: Deliverance, Little Nightmares III, Neva, Pepper Grinder, Star Wars: Hunters, Shantae Advance: Risky Revolution, and The Plucky Squire.
Or we could also find out which of those four mysterious first-party Xbox games now going multiplatform is heading to Switch. Just a thought. 
Of course, there’s likely to be at least a few brand-new game announcements. Hopefully, it will be a fruitful Direct, and we luckily don’t have too much longer to wait and find out. What do you hope to see in the Partner Direct? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The rumor mill can slow to a halt, as Nintendo has finally announced a Direct, albeit through its external partners. On Wednesday, Nintendo will host a Partner Showcase Direct on its channels.


Nintendo's Partner Showcase will air on February 21 at 6 a.m. PT / 9 a.m. ET on its YouTube channel. The company says to expect around 25 minutes of info, focused on Nintendo Switch games arriving in the first half of 2024 from publishing and developing partners.




No switch-up


So yes, let's just get this out of the way now: with the words "Partner" and explicit emphasis on the external side of publishing and developing, I would not expect any sort of big Switch 2 reveal or anything. Heck, even a reveal of something like Metroid Prime 4 is likely out of the cards.


If you're looking for the regular reason to over-hype yourself, though, there's always Hollow Knight: Silksong. More realistically, studios like Level-5 have been making regular appearances at shows like these, and that company in particular pushed a big batch of games into 2024. I'd put some good odds on Level-5 showing up, though to be clear, that's just speculation on my part.


Otherwise, expect a lot of non-Nintendo games coming to Switch. It's an interesting choice, seeing as this is Nintendo's first Direct of the year, and the same time as they'd usually host a big Direct to kick it off. It's a shame the company isn't putting any of its own stuff into the mix, and at 25 minutes compared to a hopeful 40 or so, I imagine we'll still hear speculation about a full Nintendo Direct long after.


At least for now, we can spin down the rumors and look forward to seeing what's hitting Switch soon, as it enters its seventh year of life. We'll see what's in store at 6 a.m. PT / 9 a.m. ET on February 21, 2024.

In a pre-launch blog, the developer explained what makes these build options such a big deal.


On Steam, developer Eleventh Hour Games detailed the upcoming Warlock and Falconer, adding to Last Epoch's whopping 13 unique class masteries. These are, more specifically, not character classes as such, but sub-masteries belonging to specific classes. And while they technically slot into existing combat paradigms in a broad sense, they also open up interesting niches, such as the Falconer's pet-focused ambusher approach.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last year, a leak showed that a remaster of Beyond Good and Evil is in the works for the 20th anniversary. At the time, the alleged game had been rated by the ESRB, and now the Ubisoft title has shown up on the Korean ratings board.


The Game Rating and Administration Committee (or GRAC for short) has listed the project on its website, and has given it a 12+. While the site is in Korean, the actual title is right there in plain English, referring to it as Beyond Good and Evil Remaster. The listing was added on February 16, so this is pretty fresh.


Screenshot via Destructoid.


Granted, we already knew that this was happening, as Ubisoft itself confirmed it. Still, we've yet to see anything beyond the confirmation. The original came out in November 2003, so it's a little late if this is going to be a special 20th year special.


Still no sequel, though


A remaster is great, of course, but what a lot of people are ideally wanting is a sequel. As I say, the game came out at the start of the new millennium. While a sequel has been in the works for some time, it's pretty much in development hell at this stage. Who knows whether it will ever see the light of day.


In any case, we may still get a modern take on the first (and only) game. Remastering it will likely mean a tweak to the controls to make them more modern (a lot has changed these past two decades) and, of course, sleeker visuals.


We've been promised a Beyond Good and Evil 2 for years. At the very least, it's nice to know we get some Beyond Good and Evil, sometime hopefully soon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While it may be overshadowed at the moment by its RPG counterpart, Granblue Fantasy: Relink, the formidable fighter Granblue Fantasy Versus: Rising is not one to sit back. Two months after the announcement trailer, Nier: Automata's 2B is back with a new trailer showcasing some devastating fighting and a killer version of Weight of the World.


Another reminder of Nier: Automata's greatness


2B is set to become available on February 20, 2024, as the second DLC fighter. Her pack will cost $7.99 individually. Alternatively, players who have purchased the Deluxe Character Pass 1 will receive the android alongside five other DLC fighters. Aside from her iconic swords, Virtuous Contract and Virtuous Treaty, 2B (and 2P) can wield a large number of weapons from the YoRHa armory. 


Screenshot via [GBVS] Granblue Fantasy Versus Official Channel YouTube


At this point, 2B is a safe bet for just about any game. The character is overwhelmingly loved by gamers, no matter their preferred genre. It's to the point that even if she's not a legitimate addition to a title, you can almost guarantee there's a mod that adds her in some way, shape, or form.




While she doesn't exactly mesh with the world of Granblue, 2B is immune from much criticism due to the "rule of cool." Be it Final Fantasy XIV, Soulcalibur VI, and more, Square Enix knows that she prints money and will license the character for just about anything. That's a huge win if you're a fan, and even if you're not, you get to beat the white-haired war machine into the ground.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A recent SteamDB listing seems to indicate that Dragon's Dogma 2, the much-anticipated sequel to the best "recent" IP in Capcom's catalog, might be getting a demo soon. 


The hype started when u/CannedBeanofDeath on Reddit noticed a telltale piece of intel below:




It merely lists the addition of an "Unknown App" to the Dragon's Dogma 2 backend on Steam. Still, there are only so many things that this unknown app can turn out to be, namely, the Dragon's Dogma 2 demo. The smoking gun here seems to be that the "Unknown App" is listed as "free on demand", a status that usually applies to demos.


As of the time of this writing, there's no confirmation from Capcom that this will be the demo, but we know that Capcom sure loves their demos, and we also know that the release of DD2 will take place about one month from now. This would be a great time to get a demo out.


The original Dragon's Dogma wasn't exactly a massive hit when it first came out, possibly due to it not featuring the most amazing graphics of its era. Luckily, players quickly realized the game was filled with ultra-fresh gameplay ideas, such as having to climb huge enemies to kill them. You won't be getting much giant-slaying done here by hitting monsters in their feet until they inexplicably die.


Ever since its release back in 2012, Dragon's Dogma name has been growing in the hearts of the gaming community. It's only natural that a lot of people are already revving up the engine of the sequel's hype train.


Dragon's Dogma 2 will come out on March 22 for the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.

Mario vs. Donkey Kong is finally here on Switch. This remake gives the original GBA puzzle platformer a fresh lick of paint and throws in a handful of new features too — including a fully revamped score. The composers for the GBA original, DigiPen Music Department, were brought back on this time around and a new interview from the department's website provides an interesting look into the process of updating a 20-year-old soundtrack.
As it turns out, recreating the GBA music was not a case of downloading it onto a computer and hitting a button that says "modernise". Aside from writing tunes for the remaster's two new worlds, the team also composed and arranged acoustic performances to complement the virtual soundscape of the original soundtrack. As the game's production, engineering and mastering lead Tacket Brown states:

The DRM was added on September 15, just a few days before the game's official release which resulted in a bit of controversy. Fingers have often been pointed at Denuvo for affecting the performance of games that implement it, though the company itself has repeatedly denied these allegations. At the very least, it doesn't seem to be the case with Lies of P which runs smoothly on PC.

Nearly 10 years on from 2015's Helldivers, Helldivers 2 carefully adapts the simple yet exciting formula of bug-blasting with buddies for a modern audience. Arrowhead Game Studios has swapped the top-down perspective for third-person while maintaining the frenetic, ballistic loop of crash-landing on hostile planets, completing difficult missions, and extracting against all odds.

Reports that Nintendo's unannounced Switch successor may be subject to a behind-the-scenes delay suggest that the current console might have yet another Holiday season all to itself.
In March, Nintendo Switch will enter its eighth year, and scuttlebutt from industry sources had previously pegged 2024 as the year the long-rumoured successor — which we've all dubbed 'Switch 2' — might finally poke its head above the parapet. Now, though, rumours suggest Nintendo might need to pad things out longer than previously planned. March's Princess Peach: Showtime! is the only wholly new first-party Switch offering announced for 2024 so far.

For Monaghan, it's not a question of whether he's willing to reprise his role as the character, but a question of the circumstances in which that character would appear.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's a particular boss encounter in Balatro that always feels like it's cheating a bit. In this mesmerising poker roguelike, each stage is made up of three blinds - small, big and boss - with the blind essentially being a high score you have to hit by playing different kinds of poker hands - your traditional flushes, straights, pairs and so on. Each hand has its own number of chips and multiplier bonuses associated with it, and Balatro's whole deal is about shuffling closer to victory by making the most of the cards you're dealt. While some blinds are tiny, stretching to just 300 or 450 early on in a run, they quickly start ramping up into the tens of thousands as each successfully defeated boss blind ups the ante and the accompanying stakes. Reach an ante of eight, and bingo, you've won a run of Balatro.
The boss blind I keep coming a cropper with, though, is The Flint. This sucker not only halves a hand's chip score, but it also cuts its multiplier in two as well, and I've yet to figure out exactly how to defeat it. Sometimes it appears with a blind of just 600, but other times it's been an enormous 22,000. In fairness, all bosses have little tricks like this. Some will debuff certain card suites, making them useless in your overall score count. Others may only let you play one hand type the entire match, while the cheeky Tooth will deduct you $1 for every card used. But Balatro isn't simply about beating the odds with smart and intelligent card plays. It's about bending, twisting and abusing those odds to your will - also through smart and intelligent card plays. Cheating isn't just encouraged in Balatro. It's damn near mandatory, and it's all thanks to the brilliantly conceived joker cards that give the game its Latin-based name.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It looks like the rumors from last year of a "Complete Edition" of Shin Megami Tensei V might have been accurate after all. According to Gematsu, an official rating popped up from the Game Rating and Administration Committee of Korea for Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance. The description for the rating indicated it was a complete edition of Shin Megami Tensei V with improvements and additional content. The rating was later removed.




No platforms or any other information was provided, but it would be par for the course for Atlus to be porting Shin Megami Tensei V to other consoles. Even though SMTV is the best-selling entree in the franchise, as of now it's been a Switch exclusive. With the massive Persona fanbase that has grown on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC over the last few years, surely there are some fans on those consoles looking for a chance to play. Even though the two franchises are different, there's some pretty big overlaps in terms of gameplay.


Honestly, I'd be included in that bunch. Shin Megami Tensei V looks amazing and I've heard the story is top-notch. But for me, there's certain types of game I'd prefer to play on ms Switch and others I'd prefer to play on PS5. SMTV is one of those games. I'd be happy for a 1:1 port, but with the description mentioning improvements and additional content this will probably be a no-brainer for me.

The game's been in Early Access since April 2019, and 1.0 marks a huge step forward with loads of new gear.


As per Eleventh Hour Games' recent itemization blog post on Steam, Last Epoch's already substantial roster of items will be substantially expanded upon on February 21. Broadly, players can look forward to new armor, weapons, Unique-rarity gear, item affixes, and Armor Sets, which should make things very interesting both in the early and late game progression stages. What's particularly exciting is that some of the new Uniques alter certain classes' skills in meaningful ways, suggesting some very promising synergies.

The mass strike took place on Valentine's Day, February 14, and involved almost 700 employees from several of Ubisoft's divisions, including the Paris, Montpellier, Annecy, Lyon, and Bordeaux studios. The conflict lies primarily with the alleged imbalance between management profits and the below inflation increases in employee salaries for the second consecutive year. According to STJV, Ubisoft continues to enjoy making a profit despite deficits in management, and workers are being exploited to increase profits.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's no shortage of games out there inspired by FromSoftware's Souls games, but Enotria: The Last Song is drawing water from a unique well. Developer Jyamma Games throws Italian folklore into the Soulslike mix for their ambitious attempt, and it's officially launching on June 21, 2024.


Epic Games Store pre-orders are now live for Enotria: The Last Song, which is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Steam. PS5 and Steam pre-orders will arrive later, and for now, you can see a cinematic preview in the new release date trailer below.




In the world of Enotria, players can don role-changing masks and unveil the land's secrets through the power of Ardore. The land is apparently stuck "in an endless play," and as the Mask of Change it's up to you to take on enemies and free all the actors who find themselves unwillingly living out roles in an endless script. 


Combat sounds like it might favor a more aggressive playstyle a la Bloodborne, with the ability to chain parries and implement quicksteps to swiftly avoid attacks. There's also a posture-breaking system that opens enemies up for a counterattack, triggering an "Awakened" buff.

Pay to play (early)


Pre-order bonuses for the Standard Edition include the original soundtrack extract and a single weapon material upgrade. Deluxe Edition pre-orders pack in that plus a digital art book extract and more in-game content, from exclusive weapon skins to bonus DLC. Beyond that, folks who opt to pre-order the Deluxe Edition will get to play Enotria: The Last Song 72 hours earlier than everyone else. Hopefully, there will be impressions floating around before that to better determine just how enticing an incentive that is.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You can take the Fallout: New Vegas out of the silly, but you can't take the silly out of Fallout: New Vegas. Or something like that. At any rate, someone has managed to make modding history by finding an old file that was thought to have been lost to the annals of time.


This one is very much for you late '90s/early 2000s nu-metal fans. As spotted by PC Gamer, Twitch streamer Micky D (via Twitter user UsagiCola) has re-uploaded a mod for NV that adds Fred Durst of Limp Bizkit fame as a companion. Whenever you interact with him, he can only reply in snippets from some of the band's music.




Neither Micky D nor UsagiCola are the original creators of the mod. The story goes that modder lb8068 created and uploaded it around seven years ago. However, after formatting their computer, they lost the files.


It's my way, my way or the (abandoned) highway


The person who has brought it back from the dead said they just happened to have it on their hard drive. As such, we can once again enjoy the stylings of Durst as he accompanies us across the Mojave Desert. You can download the mod from here.


Ah, I remember the nu-metal days. Spiky hair, baggy JNCOs, no deodorant. Good times. Limp Bizkit was definitely at the forefront of the genre, even if Durst himself was pretty much the embodiment of a skater douche.


Personally, I wouldn't really want him singing and rapping at me while I play Fallout, but it's nice to know that the mod has found a new home. We should all celebrate video game preservation. Whatever form it comes in.

NL's stalwart PJ O'Reilly enjoyed his time with it, awarding it a 'Good' 7/10 in his review and highlighting the new co-op mode as a highlight in a game that lacks teeth: "If you're a more seasoned player looking for platforming challenges, this game finds its strengths as an experience for younger gamers or as a co-op title. Taken as such, it absolutely earns a recommendation."

Even ongoing server connectivity issues haven’t done much to spoil the sense of fun, which incidentally, can also be shared on the Steam Deck.
Indeed, following a quick Proton update on Valve’s part, its previously SteamOS-incompatible anti-cheat will no longer put the kibosh on you dropping into Helldivers 2 via your Deck. I’ve been testing on both an original 512GB model and the newer Steam Deck OLED, and as long as you don’t mind dropping the quality settings, it can usually run tidily above 30fps.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A week and a half ago, Helldivers 2 dropped on PC and PS5, and it's been gaining quite a reputation. 


While studio Arrowhead Games recently said it needed to cap servers at 450,000 players, it looks as though the game is close to reaching that limit. According to the latest figures from SteamDB, the game reached 409,367 concurrent players yesterday, with around 180,000 playing at the time of writing. To put that into perspective, Starfield reached 330,723 when it was released a few months back, so Helldivers 2 is already doing better than Bethesda's newest IP.

We're also seeing the Helldivers sequel at the number one spot on Steam's Top Sellers list, once again knocking the Steam Deck down one place (as of this article being published). Even the Super Citizen Edition of the game is doing well, currently sitting pretty at the fifth spot, ahead of Baldur's Gate 3 and Palworld.


It's all a numbers game


The fact that it's still pretty new probably attests to this continued popularity. It could also be because the developer recently announced that – until the end of yesterday – players could earn "XP and Requisition at a 50% multiplier" on top of base mission scores. 


Of course, many people are still reeling from the unbelievable success of Palworld. With a peak concurrent player record of over 2.1 million, it made the game a tough act to follow for any studio ("Only 400,000 players? A pittance, I say!")


As with a lot of new releases these days, Arrowhead has been putting out a few Helldivers 2 fires. Patch after patch has been sent out, with the team also wanting to improve server stability to prevent further issues. I guess this is just the world we live in now.

As reported by @TheRealJTV4K60 and shown on the PS Store, the PvE game has managed to overtake both Fortnite and Call of Duty to become the bestselling game on PSN in the USA as of February 18, which is nothing to scoff at. It has achieved similar feats on Steam where it's enjoyed being the bestselling title, surpassing even the Steam Deck's sales. The current success the game is enjoying can, in part, be attributed to the fact that for this weekend, extra XP is being served out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[MojeFedora.cz informuje, že ovladač Nvidia už není v GNOME Software. Před 7 lety se zjednodušil způsob, jak nainstalovat proprietární ovladače Nvidia do Fedory. Pokud jste po instalaci souhlasili s repozitáři třetích stran, přidal se speciální repozitář z RPMFusion, který balíčky s ovladačem obsahoval. Zároveň byla přidána integrace s GNOME Software, takže stačilo dát hledat v katalogu softwaru "nvidia" a ovladač šlo nainstalovat několika kliknutími.

Nyní se od tohoto řešení ustoupilo. Ovladač v RPMFusion totiž není podepsaný klíčem Fedory a tudíž nefunguje se SecureBootem, který má dnes zapnutý většina počítačů. Zmizela pouze integrace s GNOME Software, kde už nyní ovladač nenajdete. Repozitář s ovladačem je stále k dispozici a lze ho doinstalovat přes DNF. Uživatelů, kteří ovladač už nainstalovaný mají, by se to nemělo nijak dotknout. Momentálně se hledá nové řešení, které by bylo jednoduché a zároveň fungovalo se SecureBootem.]]></summary>

A mod for Matthew Perry career high and/or nuclear apocalypse RPG sidequest Fallout: New Vegas, which was thought lost since some time around 2016, has been found by chance on someone's hard drive. The content of this mod, you ask? It adds a companion who looks like redoubtable nu-metal pioneer Fred Durst. I was trying to come up with a pun to do with "nookie" or that modders will "keep rollin'", but I respect you too much for that (also it's Monday and I'm very tired - give me something to break, am I right?).

Major cards are used at portals to conjure up a particular biome or world type and set the difficulty, including an approximate choice of resident NPC factions, local fauna and resources. Minor cards are played within worlds to mess with their workings. You can lower the gravity for optimal umbrella gliding conditions, alter the weather or summon a Blood Moon (sorry, Zelda) that reduces your max health.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ping-Pong.
When Atari first announced qomp2 as a reimagining of the arcade classic Pong, we must admit to feeling somewhat sceptical of the similarities. Yet after completing all 30 levels in the Graphite Lab-developed puzzler, we’re convinced that it is very much the spiritual successor that Pong deserves. It’s a game that only increased its grip on us the further we progressed until we could think of little else, combining simple gameplay with devilishly difficult labyrinths to provide an experience like no other. Well, except its immediate predecessor, of course.
The first qomp unfortunately skipped the Switch entirely, but its sequel is well worth checking out if you’re a fan of action puzzlers. The general gist is that you directly control the ball from Pong, which has decided it’s had enough of being whacked back and forth between two paddles and wants to explore the outside world. The thing is, the outside world is a greyscale labyrinth full of traps, enemies, and bosses, and so it’s up to you to guide the little ball to safety.

Nintendo's shares in Japan have dropped after last week's report that the Switch successor will now not be launching until Q1 2025 (thanks, VGC).

However, following the claim by Brazilian journalist Pedro Henrique Lutti Lippe that the next hardware will not be released until 2025 (something that VCG and Eurogamer also corroborated), the shares seem to no longer be on the rise.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Riot Forge’s last stab  at publishing smaller spin-offs from indie teams has resulted in Bandle Tale: A League Of Legends Story, which at first glance has all the things I love in self-proclaimed cosy games: gorgeous pixel art, laidback objectives and characters cute enough to trigger primal cheek-squishing instincts. But despite looking like an SNES classic and playing like a mix between Animal Crossing and Stardew Valley, Bandle Tale unfortunately ties itself in knots with overly grindy crafting that had me rubbing my temples in an effort not to combust.

What's more relaxing than a farming sim? Many of us love to wind down with a few hours of tending crops, looking after cows, and taking in the seasons in a good ol' Story of Seasons game. And for almost 30 years, this hugely popular series has been sowing the seeds and setting the standard for the genre.
So what if it were to do something entirely different? The farmhands have swapped their hoes for pens and taken up a spot of picross. Piczle Cross: Story of Seasons marks the first time Marvelous' farming franchise has stepped out of the mulch and into a different genre. Can you get more relaxing than a farming-based puzzle game?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We’ve come to know our Pals pretty well over the last month since the game entered early access. We know their names, abilities, and skills by heart, it seems. Now, a recent Twitter post by Pocketpair has got fans of the game humorously questioning whether the same is true about the developers.


Eagle-eyed fans were quick to point out that not only did Pocketpair get the name of their own creation wrong, but they also seemingly used the wrong number from the Paldeck. Pal number 61 is actually Kitsun, not Blazehowl. Or should that be Kingferno?


Palworld fans left confused after Pockpair gets their own Pal names wrong




The team at Pocketpair was quick to notice and apologize for their mistake, but the post is currently still live with the blunder included. Bucky, the Community Manager for Pocketpair, entered the comments to note the mistake, too. 


Strangely, the video uploaded to YouTube at the same time also featured the mistake, but this has since been rectified. 


The post has prompted an interesting response within the comments, with many players stating that they actually prefer this accidentally mistaken name to the one Blazehowl ended up with. One commenter said, “I think we can all agree that ‘Kingferno’ is a much cooler name”.


Commenters on both Twitter and YouTube were also quick to point out that within the Technology Ladder, Blazehowl Noct’s Saddle is currently named “Dark Kingferno Saddle”, prompting many to speculate why the name was changed for the early access release.


There have been a couple of name changes since Palworld hit early access, with Ice Kingpaca and Ice Reptyro becoming Kingpaca Cryst and Reptyro Cryst, so it’s not outside of the realm of possibility to expect more name changes in the future, although it seems that Blazehowl is here to stay, even if some players prefer the alternative.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Palworld is full of modding possibilities, from replacing assets with funnier options to tweaking game settings in order to make it more enjoyable, there have been a lot of mods. 


Now, a new mod by Cristiferbeast allows you to play in first-person, right in the thick of things. 




Modders add a First Person view to Palworld


In the first few days after the game first launched on January 19, there was a glitch that left players stuck inside their own bodies. It caused some pretty gruesome moments, but this seems to have been fixed in a past patch. That said, it can sometimes be distracting to constantly be looking at yourself, especially during moments when you want to take in what you’re seeing without your character drawing your attention.


Cristiferbeast's mod fixes that by making Palworld essentially an FPS. The mod can be found on both NexusMods or CurseForge, and once you’ve followed the installation instructions and got everything set up, all you need to do to enable first-person mode is press Alt+C. To disable first-person mode and go back to the intended third-person view, you just need to press Alt+V. 


It’s worth noting that Palworld was never intended to be played in first-person mode. While this may seem like I’m stating the obvious here, installing and using this mod may result in some visual glitches or other issues. 


However, this may be a mod that’s of use to those who enjoy taking and sharing in-game screenshots in order to remove their character from the picture. Currently, there is no in-game photo mode, and it’s something that players are hoping to get in a future update.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When it comes to live service games such as Last Epoch, there are times when gameplay needs to be organized around maintenance and server downtime. With the game releasing fully on February 21, of course, there’s going to be maintenance, so here’s everything you need to know. 


During the Twitch stream Q&A on February 16, Last Epoch developers urged people to spread the word about the upcoming 24-hour server maintenance period, so here I am to do just that. 


If you’re wondering what you’re going to do while the game is inaccessible, you could always head over to r/games on Reddit, where the development team will be doing an AMA. Alternatively, you can check out our guide on what to expect once 1.0 lands. 


When is the next Last Epoch Maintenance?


Prior to the full release of Last Epoch, servers will be down for approximately 24 hours beginning at roughly 11 am CST (9 am PST / 12 pm EST / 5 pm GMT). Servers will be live again, provided no issues arise during maintenance, at the same time the following day and 1.0 will be live from this point onwards. 


Are Last Epoch maintenance periods always 24 hours?


Last Epoch server maintenance periods usually last approximately two hours, but it’s worth remembering just how many updates are being implemented in preparation for the launch of 1.0. 


This 24-hour maintenance is not something that’s likely to be repeated often, with perhaps the exception of future large updates. 


Other live service games, such as Final Fantasy XIV or Genshin Impact, regularly undergo longer periods of server maintenance in order to implement larger updates, so there’s no reason that Last Epoch would be any different.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Helldivers 2 is a somewhat unexpected success, currently sitting at the top of the PSN charts and taking over the hearts and minds of gaming everywhere. 


Unfortunately, it may be taking over too many hearts and minds, as developer Arrowhead Game Studios has found out with a slew of crashes and server instability issues. It's a good problem to have, but a problem nonetheless, which is why the devs have taken a drastic step to fix the problem. 


Helldivers 2 caps player count at 450k


Announced in the official Helldivers 2 Discord and reported on Twitter by Wario64, Helldivers 2 concurrent player counts have been capped at 450,000. 




It's a drastic step for a game that relies on multiplayer and may only further compound issues that have been frustrating players. Server failure errors and long log-in queues have been the name of the game for Helldivers to date. The game is actually just winding down a bonus XP weekend announced held to compensate players who had been impacted by previous server instability. 


Addressing these stability issues has been the top priority for Arrowhead, who rolled out a patch as recently as February 14 to attempt to further optimize matchmaking.


While the cap may not be the best news for players, they can find some solace in that Arrowhead regards it as a temporary issue, and are working to raise the cap further to allow for more players and better stability. 


Helldivers 2 is available now on PlayStation 5 and PC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[BitTorrent is often characterized as a decentralized file-sharing technology. However, its reliance on centralized indexes runs contrary to this idea. Over the years, several 'indestructible' alternatives have been proposed, including the relatively new Bitmagnet software. With Bitmagnet, people can run their own private BitTorrent index, relying on DHT and the BEP51 protocol.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The funky upbeat Foamstars soundtrack is now available on Spotify, Apple Music, and other platforms. The album consisting of multiple artists can be downloaded on your phone through these services.


"From up-beat electro swing, nu-disco and deep house tracks, to the chill beats of acid jazz and R&B, the album features a colourful intermingling of a wide range of genres that will make your heart sing," said Square Enix in a press release. Similar to its likely inspiration of Splatoon, the soundtrack is a true highlight of this fun-filled third-person shooter.

The album consists of 37 songs, including:

Ring-a-Ding-Ding

One of the artists involved in the project is J'Nique Nicole. Nicole is an American singer based in Tokyo. She provided backing vocals for Ashanti in 2013 and sang NieR: Automata's incredible "Weight of the World." She can also sing in Japanese. She has two singles, "Black Girl Magic" and "BAE." Nicole sounds fantastic in the Foamstars soundtrack.


Foamstars is currently available to all PlayStation Plus members on PS4 and PS5. When March 5 approaches, it will then be sold for $29.99. It won't be free-to-play.

Misjudge a particular jump by over- or undercharging it, maybe bounce back off a wall, and you may find yourself tumbling all the way back to the beginning again.

It's probably about to get a bunch of even harder levels, however, because nearly five years after release it has just got Steam Workshop support and a new set of modding tools.

While acknowledging that UE4 would be a better choice for the development of Palworld, Pocketpair had no previous experience with the engine and had to scale back its plans in order to get the game released, albeit a little late from the original 2022 planned release date.


At the time of writing, Palworld is stated to be about 60% complete, so there are a lot of planned additions to come. From the mini-Roadmap released last month, we know that PvP is on the way, as well as new Pals, bosses, and raids. However, there …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s always nice to have a way of discussing a game with its developers, and Last Epoch has provided a plethora of ways for fans to do just that. From Twitch Q&As to a thriving Discord, Eleventh Hour is always happy to talk to players, accept feedback and answer questions. 


Now they've announced they'll take it one step further with the team hosting a Reddit Ask Me Anything on February 20th at 11 am CST (so that’s 9 am PST / 12 pm EST / 5 pm GMT) on the r/Games Subreddit. 




If you’ve got any questions about the upcoming full release of Last Epoch on February 21, updates that may be coming or new features, now is your chance to get them answered. 


In case you’re wondering why Eleventh Hour isn’t performing this AMA on the Last Epoch dedicated Subreddit, they’ve already answered that question. 


“Before people start asking why we aren't doing the AMA here, this specific AMA is for a broader audience. We spend a LOT of time here, and we consider this to be our home. We don't plan to leave, and this isn't a symptom of 'LE got too big for us!'; it's just a part of the process of growth that we get asked to host events in other places."


With that in mind, if you are holding onto a burning question for the team, make sure to get to the Subreddit early, as they will be answering questions on a first come first serve basis.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hasbro, the parent company that owns the Dungeons & Dragons license, has raked in $90 million in royalty fees since the release of Baldur's Gate 3, according to a Bloomberg report. The 2023 Game of the Year for many outlets has been a massive success with a 96% review rating from over 500,000 Steam gamers. 


"Baldur’s Gate 3, last year’s most critically acclaimed video game, has brought in about $90 million since its August release for parent company Hasbro Inc. through a licensing deal," wrote Bloomberg's Cecilia D'Anastasio. 


Despite the $90 million in revenue, Hasbro has laid off many of its staff. It cut 1,000 of its full-time staff in January after taking away 900 jobs over the past few months. CBC News reports 29% of Hasbro's workforce has been let go. This came after a reportedly weak holiday season.

Despite that horrible news, the universally beloved game was given Game of the Year from The Game Awards over steep competition like The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and Marvel's Spider-Man 2, among others. It also just won the coveted prize from the DICE Awards. 


Despite the game's 1.0 release back in August, developer Larian Studios is still updating Baldur's Gate 3 six months later. In today's sixth patch, unique kisses have been added to the game for each romancable character. 


"All characters now have unique kisses that reflect their personality, with an emphasis on the plural," said Larian Studios in an update blog on Steam. "These kisses are randomised and vary from the incredibly romantic to… uh, a little more intense." Additionally, new idle animations have been added in the camp to "help your campsite feel more alive." Other gameplay modifications have been added.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Palworld players can seem a little obsessed with the idea of breeding the perfect Pals; hundreds of cakes resulting in hundreds of Eggs to pass down the perfect Passive Traits for a chosen purpose. For the most part, these desired Passive Traits are ones that boost mount speed. 


Jetragon is, by a mile, the fastest flying mount in the game at a basic level - boasting a speed stat of 3300 with no additional Passive Traits. That isn’t exactly a secret within the Palworld community. But with Traits such as Swift or Runner, the speed increases to insane speeds.


One player, who goes by the name of PurpleStahli on Reddit, seems to have used up all of their in-game luck by completely skipping the breeding step by catching what might be the most OP Jetragon I, or a lot in the community, have ev…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Skull and Bones is finally out today. Let's play the opening hour and see if it is worth wait. Reportedly, the game began development as early as 2013 and spent a few years as an Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag spinoff before turning into Black Flag MMO, before finally emerging as a standalone game announcement in 2017. In the six years since its announcement we've seen teases of it here and there, had chances to play in various betas and alphas, and it even appeared on our cover in 2022. Skull and Bones has been a long time coming, but today everyone is finally able to play it. Our full review isn't ready quite yet, but you can  read Matt Miller's positive early impressions so far by heading here. You can also check out an hour of gameplay below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The launch of 1997’s Final Fantasy VII on Playstation signaled a seismic shift in the video game landscape. The transition from pixel art to fully animated computer graphics was a massive enough leap ahead, but the beauty of this classic title was much more than skin deep. Featuring a stellar cast of beloved characters, a rock-solid combat system, and a story with the potential to instill emotions ranging from awe and joy to grief and anger, the legacy of Final Fantasy VII is well-established in the RPG genre and the games industry as a whole. Read more...]]></summary>

It’s unclear what form those projects are taking, but according to one report, one of them may star a Mandalorian.
Insider Gaming reports that its sources have disclosed that Respawn is developing a first-person title in which players assume the mantle of a Mandalorian. For clarification, players do not play as the Mandalorian, as in Din Djarin from the hit Disney Plus series, but rather as a different bounty hunter. The game is reportedly set during the height of the Galactic Empire and will see players capturing or killing bounty targets.
Additionally, Insider Gaming’s sources claim the game is not an open-world title. Inst…]]></summary>

Since then, the game has seen numerous delays and fundamental reworks on the development side. Our cover story on the game captured one moment in the evolving project’s life in the summer of 2022, and it has continued to change in the months that followed. In recent weeks, some sentiments on the internet and in gaming communities have concluded that, by this point, the game that is releasing must be a mess.
I’m happy to report that’s not the case; Skull and Bones is a lot of fun.

If you have a) been enjoying Cobalt Core as part of RPS Game Club this month, and b) especially like it when Soggins turns up with his ship of malfunctioning missile launchers, then I implore you to make Sunshine Heavy Industries your next port of call in your Steam library. It's what the Cobalt Core devs Rocket Rat Games made first, and you can immediately see a lot of shared DNA between the two games - not least its chunky, charming pixel visuals and some crossover between its cast of characters - including our pal Soggins. 
It is, I should stress, a very different game to Cobalt Core - it's a sandboxy spaceship builder with zero combat involved, for starters - but I've been playing it again this week ahead of some other Game Club-themed articles I've got cooking, and I've been having a lovely time with it. Not least because I get to spend more time with Soggins the very smug frog, all while listening to even more excellent chill tunes from Cobalt Core composer Aaron Cherof.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm kind of fascinated by what happened to Hello Neighbor. The original, a stealth horror game against a creepy AI that learned your likely movements, was hugely popular in alpha in 2016. The series was acquired by TinyBuild in 2020, and since then there has been a heroic number of spin-offs. There's one set in an amusement park, a multiplayer game called Secret Neighbor in which one small child is actually a large adult man in disguise, a direct sequel called Hello Neighbor 2, and a VR game called Search And Rescue. I think everyone got a bit of Neighbor fatigue there, lads.
This might include the original creator Nikita Kolesnikov, as (still under the auspices of TinyBuild) he's made a new thing. Currently on Steam for playtesting, the project currently known as RBO isn't falling far from the home invasion tree, as players will either be a home-owning Protector - a McCallister, if you will - or an Intruder, or Wet Bandit.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Because it’s somehow my job to worry about the technical fidelity of electronic toys, I’ve been eyeing the long-overdue arrival of Skull and Bones with some nervousness. After nearly a decade of delays, you’d probably just want to get it out the door, right? Skip straight to the open-world pirate adventuring, none of that 'making it work on a range of graphics cards' nonsense.
But nope. For all its other shortcomings, Skull and Bones performs alright on PC, very often more smoothly than its system requirements suggest. Though I’d still recommend abiding by its SSD storage requirement – following the rules might not be very piratey, but installing on a hard drive will curse you to some pretty tedious load screen waits. Geoffrey Rush would hate it, honestly.
While Edwin sequesters himself in the starting area, let’s head below deck for a closer look at Skull and Bones’ PC particulars. That includes a full rundown of its graphics options – which include ray tracing and DLSS – and a quick guide to the best settings for an ideal prettiness-to-performance ratio.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As promised earlier this week, Microsoft and Xbox executives Phil Spencer (head of Xbox), Sarah Bond (president, Xbox) and Matt Booty (Head of Xbox Game Studios) got together today to share some important "updates on the Xbox business." You can check out the full update below, but the headline is that four future formerly Xbox and PC exclusive games are coming to other consoles, but Spencer was not ready to reveal what those games are. They are games that are more than a year old that have been on Xbox and PC for awhile. A couple of the games, Spencer says, are community-driven and service-based games that have reached their full potential on Xbox and PC. They are franchises that Xbox wants to continue to invest in. Two are smaller games that were not built to be platform exclusives. Though he wasn't ready to share the game titles, he did confirm that Starfield and Indiana Jones are not in that group.
According to sources reported by The Verge, it seems the four titles may be Hi-Fi Rush, Pentiment, Sea of Thieves, and Grounded.
Spencer cushioned everything he said, presumably in expectation of pushback from Xbox fans by saying, “We make every decision with the long term health of Xbox in mind.” He also made sure to remind everyone that Xbox already has games on other platforms, calling out Minecraft in particular. Spencer also briefly touched on the company's decision to lay off over 1900 employees, though offered little in terms of reasonable rationalization.
Bond also mentioned that Xbox is looking forward to and making plans surrounding future hardware and vaguely promised a substantial leap in technical prowess, but offered little in terms of concrete details.


The podcast also confirmed Activision/Blizzard games are coming to Game Pass starting with Diablo IV on March 28 and that we can expect a new Xbox showcase in June.]]></summary>

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/02/15/ea-sports-college-football-25-arrives-this-summer-full-reveal-in-may"/>
        <updated>2024-02-15T18:07:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s been three years since EA announced it was making a new college football game after a years-long hiatus. Dubbed EA Sports College Football 25, not much has materialized about the game since its reveal in the way of updates, but the publisher has broken its silence with a new trailer confirming a release window and promising a bigger look at the title in the near future.
The video heavily leans into the skepticism fans have expressed over College Football’s existence, proudly expressing, “Yes, the game is real” while showing off snippets of behind-the-scenes development footage. The snazzy video doesn’t do much besides that, but it ends with a promise of a full reveal in May and a summer launch window. 


EA Sports College Football 25 is being developed by EA Orlando (formerly known as Tiburon), the team behind the Madden games. This will be the first college football game from the publisher since the demise of its NCAA Football series, the last entry of which was released in 2013. The franchise was shelved due to a 2014 federal lawsuit in which the judge ruled that the NCAA’s long-standing rule prohibiting college athletes from being compensated for their in-game likenesses was unlawful. 
With Name, Image, Likeness (NIL) rules now in place in college sports, players can now be paid for appearing in advertisements or products. That would, of course, include video games. EA Sports struck a deal with OneTeam Partners to broker deals with players to include their NIL in the upcoming game. However, this was met with resistance from school/player licensing agency The Brandr Group last summer, which filed a lawsuit to prevent EA from conducting such deals with OneTeam Partners. Both entities eventually agreed to a settlement in November, dropping the lawsuit (thanks College Football HQ). 
We don’t know what platforms EA Sports College Football 25 will target, but that answer should hopefully come in May’s larger update.]]></summary>

Hey, they're talking about me! I haven't played the wide-eyed space game since before the pandemic, partly because I only own the PS4 version and now that I'm RPS news editor, I'm not allowed to touch consoles any more. Seriously, they burn my skin on contact. Anyway, let's have a gander at the trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new trailer for Princess Peach: Showtime shows off some more outfits and abilities the Mushroom Kingdom’s pink monarch has up her royal sleeve. 
Princess Peach: Showtime pits Peach against the villainous Sour Bunch, who crashes a performance at the Sparkle Theater. Its guardian, Stella, grants Peach the ability to transform and gain powers based on the costumes she dons. Stages take the form of different theater plays with ever-changing sets. 
The video introduces Figure Skater Peach, which sees her gracefully skating across a winter-themed stage and performing spins to take out enemies. The Dashing Thief costume gives Peach a Carmen Sandiego-esque look and vibe as she uses a retractable grappling hook to zipline and swing across 2D levels while evading security bots. Mermaid Peach grants a siren-like singing voice used in what appears to be a type of musical mini-game. Mighty Peach basically turns the Princess into a Super Sentai-like hero battling aliens using super strength and a jetpack to take out foes mid-air.


Princess Peach: Showtime is coming to Switch on March 22. Nintendo is also launching pink rose-colored Joy-Cons for the occasion.]]></summary>

Declaring your game "the spiritual successor to Freelancer" is bold and ambitious, considering how the spaceship sim is still so beloved after 20 years that our readers voted it your 16th favourite space game of all time. This ambition is wild when the tiny development team is led by someone best known for replacing Skyrim's dragons with Thomas The Tank Engine. So while I'm not much of a spaceship sort, I had to check out the demo for Underspace, which aims to combine Freelancer shoot-o-trading space action with a dash of Lovecraftian horror.

Tracking technology has many pitfalls, including how Google Maps can be accidentally used to track people, and the fact that if you systematically turn off cookies, your internet browsing experience becomes increasingly bizarre. I am offered adverts for afro hair care products and huge bags of puppy kibble, because the algorithms no longer have any idea who I am or how many small dogs I have. And yet.
Surely this technology has reached the point where, if I open a game for the first time in several weeks, it should be able to tell I haven't played for a long time, and ask if I would like a small refresher of the controls.

You will be shocked and aroused to learn that I preface with all this just so I can make an exception of Islands Of The Caliph. Does this mean she's becoming more open minded, or just that she's found a way to gripe and complain even within a recommendation? Who can say, readers.
What I can say is that I don't merely hate it less than its genremates. I think it's a bloody great little RPG, full of charm and detail that never drags it down.

He's an ungrateful little sod if you do rescue him from certain doom, but I kinda love him for it anyway - and thanks to an industrious pair of modders, you can now have Soggins join your crew to inflict his own special brand of personal chaos on you.

The modern controls are bad, plain and simple, and are as much an enemy to Tomb Raider's incredibly precise mode of 3D platforming as the tigers and wolves that stalk its trap-filled catacombs. They are utterly maddening, and the antithesis of everything Tomb Raider stands for. I implore you, do not go anywhere near them, for your own sake as well as Lara's.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you've been yearning to take up arms against Super Earth as either an arachnid, a robot or a filthy (managed) democracy-hating human traitor, then I have bad news, roughneck. Helldivers 2 will "never" get a PvP mode, according to Arrowhead's CEO Johan Pilestedt. The reason? They want to avoid encouraging any toxic behaviour in the new shooter's multiplayer community.
Given that Helldivers 2 is a game with mandatory friendly fire in which you can kill team-mates by respawning right on top of them, I fear the Good Ship Camaraderie may already have sailed, but I'm very early on in my Helldiver career, and I'm... intrigued by how Arrowhead's efforts at community curation sit alongside/within the game's premise of playing a dirty space fascist locked in an endless xenophobic crusade.

That makes it a great choice for gaming up to 4K, while costing just a bit over the £500 mark - £539 to be accurate after a £50 discount that puts it below the UK RRP of £579. 
That price is for a relatively modest Zotac Twin Edge model which fits easily even into small form factor PC, but thanks to the efficiency of the Ada Lovelace architecture the card should still run quite cool and quiet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new update for The Sims 4 has added options to give characters vitiligo, the autoimmune disorder which causes patches of skin to lose pigmentation. Rather than a handful of preset full-body patterns, The Sims 4's vitiligo impressively comes as loads of patterns for separate bodyparts, so you can create a wide range of effects. And no, you don't need to buy an expansion for it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Fantastic Four finally arrive in the Marvel Cinematic Universe next year, and Marvel Studios has officially revealed who will don the team’s iconic blue suits.
The Fantastic Four was first announced in 2019 and is scheduled to premiere next year as the second film in Phase Six of the MCU. In a sweet Valentine's Day message, Marvel announced the following actors will portray Marvel’s First Family: 
Happy Valentine’s Day from Marvel’s First Family! Pedro Pascal, Vanessa Kirby, Ebon Moss-Bachrach, and Joseph Quinn are The Fantastic Four.

February 14, 2024
Reed Richards/Mister Fantastic - Pedro Pascal (The Last of Us, The Mandalorian)
Sue Storm/Invisible Woman - Vanessa Kirby (Napoleon, The Crown) 
Johnny Storm/Human Torch - Joseph Quinn (Stranger Things, Overlord)
Ben Grimm/The Thing - Ebon Moss-Bachrach (The Bear, The Punisher)
Pedro Pascal has been on a roll lately, starring as Joel in HBO's The Last of Us, portraying the titular Mandalorian in The Mandalorian, and starring in films such as The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent, and the upcoming Gladiator 2. Vanessa Kirby made her name portraying Princess Margaret in the Netflix series The Crown, most recently played Joséphine in Ridley Scott's historical epic Napoleon, and has appeared in the recent Mission: Impossible films as Alanna. Stranger Things season 4 fans know Joesph Quinn best as the season's breakout character, Eddie Munson. Ebon Moss-Bachrach has recently been known as Richard "Richie" Jerimovich in the FX series The Bear and as Arvel Skeen in the Star Wars series Andor. 
WandaVision director Matt Shakman will direct The Fantastic Four, though its story details remain scarce. The Fantastic Four is scheduled to hit theaters on July 25, 2025.]]></summary>

The Cosmic Wheel Sisterhood, a visual novel Tarot-themed card game from perennial (perhaps perineal, in this case) favourites Deconstructeam, was praised by Edwin in his review, and I was going to use the same strapline for this news post had he not got there first. Because now, in time for the season of romance, they've teamed up with sex toy purveyors Uberrime to create a frankly prohibitively massive dildo as an official tie-in for the game, which can be won in a free competition by three lucky people living in either the UK, EU, US or Canada (as in, they each win their own dildo; they don't have to time share).
I mean I say "prohibitively", but I don't know your life.

The strikers are calling it a "badly balanced rewards system". Cheeky devils!
The news comes care of a post from Le Syndicat des Travailleurs et Travailleuses du Jeu Vidéo, who have evidently been doing their homework on videogame humour. That research has paid off, for here I am writing about the strikes, though I think I probably would have written about them anyway.

In Helldivers 2 it isn't actively encouraged, nor is it punished. Accidentally vaporising your teammate with an air strike is all a part of the campaign for democracy and freedom, a hilarious byproduct of human error. I gushed about it in my review, and cheery RPS fanzine PC Gamer wrote up a quick piece on the specific ways it eeks out silliness.
But comedy isn't just accidental in Helldivers 2, oh no. I think it encourages playground behaviour of the worst order: smacking your mates into things.

He finds himself thrown in the middle of a conflict between the islands’ residents and a seafaring tribe, as well as mysterious immortal monsters called the Griegers. Adol joins a Norman warrior named Karja to sail the seas aboard a ship, including exploring an open ocean and engaging in naval combat. 


Ys X: Nordics was first released in Japan last September and will come stateside this fall. It will be available for PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Granblue Fantasy: Relink is a JRPG that is ticking off many of the action RPG tropes. It would be in danger of becoming workmanlike, such are the number of things you can tick off on your fingers like a plumber ordering parts: boss fights against improbably huge glowing monsters, an evil god, catboys, numbers popping off enemies, women who appreciate the combat applications of a thigh-high split skirt, anachronistic sunglasses, horned giants carrying halberds of the same approximate size as a caravan.
In practice, though, you sort of can't be mad at Granblue Fantasy: Relink. It's built around a layered combat system that seems impenetrable if you don't take some time to understand it. But really, Granblue Fantasy: Relink is just a game so committed to the rule of cool that the entire setting is physically impossible, and every battle is a disorientating Panic! At The Firework Factory that flirts with being a photosensitivity nightmare. I'm not selling it as such, but it's actually charming.

A developer can take many different approaches when remaking a game, but its primary goal always remains the same: to create a new experience that honors the spirit of the original. With Mario vs Donkey Kong, a remake of the 2004 Game Boy Advance title of the same name, Nintendo succeeds in this goal. By combining new worlds and modern quality-of-life features with the game's classic, delightful puzzle design, Mario vs. Donkey Kong is a strong start to Nintendo's 2024.
In the game's opening, Donkey Kong raids a toy factory where they make Mini Marios, the hottest new product on the market. To get them back, Mario must chase him down through eight worlds…]]></summary>

But you’d be a smooth-handed leaf lover, my friend, as not only does DRG’s mix of horde shooting and rock smashing translate remarkably well to the format, even this early access version is heaps of subterranean fun.

But outside this guided co-op session, several members of the RPS Treehouse were playing it on their lonesome last week, too, getting to grips with Nightingale's particular flavour of sticks-and-stones crafting, cooking up meat and berry wraps to keep ourselves fed, and generally being cajoled and maybe even lightly seduced by our fae Shakespearean guide, Puck.
With so many folks playing it - some diehard survival heads and others who are mostly just glad to be having a break from Palworld for a spell - it quickly became apparent that lots of us had quite different takes on how Nightingale worked as a craft 'em up. I swear, I don't think our RPS Slack chat has ever seen such passionate discussions about UI layouts and hotkey assignments, so we thought it might be fun (and useful) to try and distil some of those thoughts for you. Will Nightingale succeed in capturing survival newcomers with its peculiar blend of gaslamp tea leaves, or will it chaff like a Victorian corset for the survival hardcore? Join us as we discuss some of its finer points below.

There's something about that game's isometricky vantage point and precise combination of 2D pixel characters and 3D environments. The last sentence describes many virtual worlds of the late 90s, but none have stuck in my mind like Port Parm: that hodgepodge of green and rusty roofs, the canals cutting through the cobblestones, the smoky chimneys and people filling the alleyways. Bliss. I can still hear the seagulls blowing around the screen.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[DC Universe Online developer Dimensional Ink Games and its publisher Daybreak Game Company have been hit with layoffs. 
According to Kotaku, Dimensional Ink lost an unknown number of senior staff, with Game Developer reporting reductions in the art, community, and narrative departments. The team is best known for developing the superhero MMO DC Universe Online. Daybreak Games (formerly Sony Online Entertainment) has worked on several multiplayer games, including EverQuest II, H1Z1, Star Wars Galaxies, and Planetside 2. The exact number of affected employees from both studios is currently unknown. 
This is, unfortunately, the latest of an alarming trend of game industry layoffs that plagued 2023 and have only intensified in 2024. Over 5,500 jobs have been cut within January alone. Last year, over 10,000 employees in the games industry or game-adjacent industries were laid off. 
Among others this year, Embracer laid off 97 employees at Deux Ex developer Eidos-Montréal, Destroy All Humans remake developer Black Forest Games reportedly laid off 50 employees, Microsoft laid off 1,900 employees across its Xbox, Activision Blizzard, and ZeniMax, Outriders studio People Can Fly laid off more than 30 employees, and League of Legends company Riot Games laid off 530 employees.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Helldivers 2 is a third-person co-op shooter that's centred as much around action as it is comedy. Gigantic insects and red-eyed robots threaten the sanctity of Super Earth and, frankly, this isn't on. As a Helldiver, you must team up with your compatriots and pulverise these menaces for freedom (a shoulder-mounted laser cannon) and democracy (an aerial bombardment). Seriousness is reserved for the act of extermination, which adds tactility to the familiar motions of a shooter, making for horde management that promotes efficiency and frequent lapses of judgement in equal measure. Helldivers 2 is a slapstick masterpiece.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I love the idea of cosy living, which is why it was that Tiny Living update that dragged me back into The Sims 4 for a few years there. The issue of course, is that in real life, if forced to live in a space the size of the interior of a camper van, I would pile things on every surface within about 12 hours. Chaos would reign. I would hate it. But I don't hate the idea of it, which is why i enjoy things like Outbound, which is a game about living in a camper van.

That's one of the joys of Cryptmaster, an upcoming typing-driven dungeon crawler where one of the first things you can do in the demo is get your disembodied necromancer pal to lick a mysterious metal object to help identify it (it's a helmet). He's like if Hand Of Fate's dastardly dealer was a bit of a dingus and also your only hope of escaping the underworld. I love this guy.

Wolves have broken into your home and murdered all your friends, but you play as the one sheep who got away - or rather, a sheep that's been fused with a surprisingly powerful robot capable of producing a honking great greatsword to make their escape with. Thus begins the wolves' hot pursuit - not least because this robot also seems to be kind of sleeper agent for them - and your roguelike-shaped quest to avenge your fallen friends.

A few days ago, Motion Twin announced that the 35th major Dead Cells update, aptly titled The End Is Near, would be its last. Benard feels this is a betrayal of both the game's community and its current development team, Evil Empire, a spin-off studio who took the reins in 2019.

One example is the Kingston NV2, a 1TB PCIe 4.0 SSD going for just £50 on Amazon UK at the moment - some £14 below its UK RRP.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We’ve all been there. You see a chair in a game. It prompts you to sit. Curious, you oblige. 
Your digital butt meets the seat, and…nothing. You just sit and stare for a few seconds before rising and continuing your adventure. More often than not, sitting does not result in a cutscene, reward, character dialogue, or, in some cases, even a good view of your surroundings. You just sit. 
You could be slaying a mighty dragon.
You could be rescuing your captive friends.
You could be discovering the true meaning behind your existence and your place in the cosmos.
But instead, you sit. 
With some exceptions, taking a seat in games equates to a whole lot of nothing. And yet, it remains a regularly recurring mechanic. So why do we sit? Do you like to sit? How long do you sit? Should sitting still be a thing in games? Please take a seat and discuss your stance in the comments below.]]></summary>

While we're no closer to knowing the exact details of the event, we now know the "where" and "when": the announcement will happen on the official Xbox podcast this Thursday, February 15. The episode will be posted at 12 PM Pacific/3 PM Eastern

February 12, 2024
The podcast in question will feature more than just Xbox head Phil Spencer, however. Sarah Bond and Matt Booty, the Presidents of Xbox and Xbox Game studios, respectively, will also give updates on the future of the brand. 
There are a few likely candidates for discussion. The most recent is the report that Xbox exclusives would begin coming to other platforms, including Hi-Fi Rush, Starfield, and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. Speculation around this news has taken many different directions, with some even theorizing that the loss of exclusivity implies Xbox might stop making consoles altogether. A report from earlier today, however, says that this isn't the case.
The other topic on the table is the company's most recent round of mass layoffs, where over 1900 employees were let go from the company, and a Blizzard survival game years into development was canceled. While Blizzard and Microsoft have since asserted that the layoffs would have happened with or without their notorious merger, the FTC filed a complaint. Either for gamers, employees, or the regulatory bodies of the world, it's a viable point of discussion.
When the podcast is posted on Thursday, you'll be able to listen to it on Xbox's YouTube channel right here.

If you’re still reading, congratulations, you’ve either got a dangerously high tolerance for bad literary jokes or you’re really eager to hear about Nightingale, the new survival sim from Inflexion, which launches into early access on 20th February. A quick recap on Nightingale, in case you missed our early access preview today: it's a strongly British-influenced "gaslamp fantasy" experience in which players travel alone or in groups between procedurally generated fairy realms using magic portals. You can build bases in each Realm, go on story quests and hunt the wildlife for crafting materials.
Last week, RPS adventurers Edders, Kiera, Jeremy, Ollie and myself had a chance to play co-op with Aaryn Flynn, Inflexion’s CEO and former general manager at BioWare, while chatting to him about the game over Discord. The resulting, not entirely planned group interview lasted two hours and consisted mostly of people yelling at each other about ice ammo and tree monsters, but we did find time for some proper Q&A. Please find below an abbreviated transcript.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I first saw Never Grave: The Witch And The Curse rising up the Steam Next Fest charts at the end of last week, I thought, "Oh! That's a neat Hollow Knight-looking Metroivanida roguelike, I'll definitely give that a go." And having played its demo over the weekend, I can confirm: it's certainly an intriguing little thing that I'll be keen to keep an eye on when it launches into early access, possibly sometime next month. 
The biggest surprise was that, despite its very Hollow Knight-looking visuals, it actually plays more like Dead Cells in practice. Instead of being a sentient lump of flesh able to inhabit infinite bodies, you're a magical witch's hat that can possess, discard and rematerialise your chosen sack of limbs at the touch of a button. The second thing that surprised me was that it also has quite a substantial base/village building aspect to it on the side, and the third - well, perhaps this isn't so much of a surprise given everything I've just said, because it also turns out this is the next game from Palworld developers Pocketpair. Yep, it all makes a bit more sense now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["Banishers took a while to kick in," I wrote in the RPS group chat last week, "but I fought a monster made of angry witch-hunting jam last night." It was a pivotal boss fight about half way through Don't Nod's ghost hunting action-adventure RPG Banishers: Ghosts Of New Eden, and typical of the over-the-top, slightly ridiculous, but entirely earnest drama of the game that joyfully pulls you along. Don't Nod - who I am starting to suspect make their magic teen angsthologies to fund their real passion for "grimdark grown-up fantasy that you sort of suspect should be a book series" - have followed up 2018's third-person action effort Vampyr with this new semi-epic.
Banishers has a lot in common with the interwar bloodsucker, including methodical investigations and stacking moral choices, but is a much more accomplished effort. Banishers combines a sweeping, tragic love story with some very decent swashbuckling, shooting possessed skeletons in the face, and being disappointed at Puritans. A perfect game, some may say. I'd elevator-pitch it to you as a sort of goth Uncharted where you find-and-replace "treasure" with "ghosts".

They're a group of game devs based in Melbourne who formed a gang (the titular Grannies) of older people in Rockstars rootin', tootin' cowboy RPG Red Dead Redemption 2 - specifically Red Dead Online. In the pursuit of fun,  The Grannies, using a glitch known to a lot of the community, broke through the invisible walls in the game's wild west and into another, wilder west - a landscape nobody was really meant to see.
Marie Foulston, a curator who specialises in installations focused on video games, made a short documentary film about them and what they saw in 2019. Now V Buckenham (who has made many things, but may be known to most as the creator of Cheap Bots Done Quick!) to present The Grannies to watch for free online, in an immersive website experience that itslef looks like a glitching out landscape.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The major thing Inflexion's fantasy survival sim Nightingale gets right is that it makes procedural generation feel like sorcery. "Procgen" has become a ubiquitous concept in game design and especially survival game design, and I fear we've all lost sight of how magical it is to summon a landscape full of idiosyncratic flourishes from a hidden dataset. It's partly, in fairness, that many semi-randomised settings feel indistinct, smooshed together with little of the character you'd get from a "hand-made" environment and setting. Nightingale slices through the ennui in a couple of ways. 


One is that this is a relatively storied and text-driven survival experience, with a self-summoning fairy narrator, Puck, who immediately buries you in Shakespearean turns of phrase as he weaves the history of a multiple-dimensional universe of "Fae" realms, roamed by creatures of Irish, English and Scottish myth and legend. I'm not sure Puck will be everybody's cup of tea as principal quest-giver and narrator - according to Inflexion boss Aaryn Flynn, some early players have struggled to make head or tail of his dialogue. But he helps conjure up an eldritch mood that sets Nightingale apart from most genre fantasies, including the Dragon Age titles Flynn once worked on at BioWare.

And miraculously, somehow, across approximately 588 episodes of Replay, we have never revisited Metal Gear Solid. This week I am happy to correct that monumental mistake.
We will get back to Majora's Mask soon (Marcus is out on assignment this week) but we took that opportunity to revisit one of, if not the, best PlayStation games with Metal Gear Solid. It just so happens that Alex Van Aken is playing through the game for fun, so I asked him if we could just jump into his save for an hour. And you know what? It just so happened to be one of the best hours of the whole game. Alex takes out Liquid Snake in the HIND, meets the invisible overweight soldiers, and defeats Sniper Wolf. It's a fantastic snapshot of a fantastic game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mapleton, Utah, is one of the most idyllic cities imaginable. Its crime rate is 80% below average, and its council operates with complete transparency. Public meetings are streamed live on YouTube, and details of every meeting appear on the city's website. That's also how we know that the council inexplicably approved a pirate IPTV scheme for residents and local businesses, that would unwittingly render itself an illegal subscription reseller set to profit from them all.

While the series has some entries that are stronger than others, the Super Mario series doesn’t have a bad entry to date, so this list proved difficult to put together in an order we all felt comfortable with.

Or if you could recommend it to those who haven’t played it without needing to explain away the parts that haven’t aged well? In today’s gaming landscape, remasters are common, but we’ve seen an influx of full-on remakes of classic role-playing games in recent years.
While 1990’s Ys I & II is likely the earliest example of remade role-playing games, perhaps the most prominent early examples came in the form of the Pokémon franchise. Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen, 2004 remakes of the series’ debut titles less than a decade after their initial release, showcased the technological leap from original Game Boy to Game Boy Advance.

Arguably its biggest and most notable expansion was the Return to Castlevania DLC, which added all kinds of Castlevania content to the game.
The developer announced this morning, however, that it is officially time to move on. You can see the developer's full statement below.
After 5 years of service, we're hanging up the Dead Cells coat. We're extremely proud of our work on countless updates & DLC, but now it's time for something shiny and new, or maybe more than one thing 😏 More on that very soon...

Along with issuing apologies for any broken controllers related to the Derelict Distillery addition, Evil Empire also shared its appreciation for being able to add so much to Dead Cells. It also wrote, "The good news is that our Dead Cells team have been unleashed to pump their talent into our secret projects, and we'll be revealing what their crazy minds have been coming up with very soon!" while also wishing luck to Motion Twin's next announced project, Windblown, and teasing perhaps more than one project.

Access real devices with Device Streaming in Android Studio

Device streaming in Android Studio lets you securely connect to remote physical Android devices hosted in Google's secure data centers. Powered by Firebase, it's the fastest and easiest way to test your app against real devices, including the Google Pixel 8 Pro, Pixel Fold, select Samsung devices, and more.

After connecting to a device, you can deploy your app, view the display, interact with the device (including rotating or unfolding the device), and anything else you might do with a device over a direct ADB over SSL connection—all without leaving Android Studio. When you're done using the device, Google wipes all your data and factory resets the device before making it available to another developer.
During Open Alpha, you can use Device Streaming at no cost. To get started simply sign into your Developer account from Android Studio and select a Firebase project. If you don't already have a Firebase project, it's easy to create one. To learn more, go to Device Streaming in Android Studio.

General fixes and features
Below is a list of general fixes in Android Studio Jellyfish | 2023.3.1 Canary 9 and Android Gradle Plugin 8.4.0-alpha09 These are a result of your bug 
reports, which help us to make Android Studio better. If you encounter a problem, let us know by reporting a bug. You can also vote for an existing issue to indicate that it also affects

That game, which easily earned Game Informer's Game of the Year in 2016, started with such promise and a massive, enthusiastic audience, but following the 2019 announcement of Overwatch 2, support for the original Overwatch floundered, and so, too, did the community. Last year's release of Overwatch 2's PvE elements in its Invasion update pushed the hero shooter back in the right direction, but it didn't make the splash Blizzard had hoped for. With Overwatch 2 Season 9, which kicks off next week, Blizzard is making a ton of sweeping behind-the-scenes changes to make the game more approachable for players.

Originally released on the PlayStation 2, Persona 3 was the first game in its series to define its modern formula, combining social responsibilities with dungeon crawling and a lengthy, emotional story. It's been re-released multiple times and was even ported to modern consoles last year, but even the upgraded versions don't hold a candle to the mind-bending masterpiece that is Persona 5 Royal. Persona 3 Reload closes that gap, however, introducing overhauled visuals and mechanics to bring the game that started it all up to the level of quality fans of the series have come to expect. If the sales numbers and our glowing review are any indication, the upgrade has been well worth the wait.
To put these numbers in context, here are some other games that have recently reached comparable significant milestones: Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth shipped 1 million copies as of Feb 1, Nintendo's quarterly report revealed Tears of the Kingdom has sold 20 million copies, and viral hit Palworld continues to smash record after record.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Funimation and Crunchyroll, two competing anime streaming services, merged in 2021 and announced in 2022 that all of the content would eventually combine under the Crunchyroll banner. That event officially has a date, and it's April 2.
For Funimation subscribers, you will have to go through the process of merging your account before the April 2 date, and, frustratingly, any shows that were outright purchased through Funimation will not transfer to Crunchyroll. Just another reminder that when you purchase digital content, true ownership does not technically exist and you will always be at the mercy of the platform holders when it comes to access.
Crunchyroll subscribers do not need to make any changes, but the price of the subscription will rise to $100 a year soon. The merger officially going through does mean Crunchyroll will feature more content, but a price increase will always be frustrating.
Alongside this merger finally completing, Crunchyroll is also entering the video game space as a publisher. It remains to be seen what kind of video tames the anime company will help produce, but you can check out this package it sent over on Game Informer's TikTok account.
As a subscriber to both services who somehow has managed to continue to have a need for both (Outlaw Star is curiously currently only available on Funimation) the merger is bittersweet. I embrace the simplicity of one anime streaming service but don't look forward to paying more, and will forever be wary of mergers being a good thing.]]></summary>

The series officially takes place between the second and third movie and will apparently follow Knuckles (Idris Elba) has he helps Wade (Adam Pally), Tom Wachowski's (James Marsden) bumbling police partner, become a true warrior. The trailer also reveals the antagonist will be played by Rory McCann, who is best known for playing Sandor 'The Hound' Clegane in Game of Thrones, and features a two-thirds Human Giant reunion cameo with Rob Huebel and Paul Scheer. Curiously, they're sitting at an ESPN8 The Ocho desk, a gag born from the 2004 film Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story that eventually became a real thing.
Other interesting details from the trailer? Jim Carrey does not appear, nor does James Marsden, but both Sonic and Tails appear and are played by film voice actors, Ben Schwarz and Colleen O'Shaughnessey.


The series, simply titled Knuckles, will be six episodes long and begins streaming on April 26 on Paramount+. For more on the Sonic the Hedgehog Movie universe, you can read our review of the second film here.]]></summary>

The first teaser trailer for Harold Halibut was released seven years ago and was only a minute and a half long, but it immediately grabbed my attention. The footage showed a stop-animated Harold (or what looked stop-animated) cleaning up graffiti in an underwater facility. The striking visuals inspired a thought I don’t often have – how did they do that? It was my first question for game director Ole Tillmann and art director Onat Hekimoglu when I recently spoke with them.


“We actually started with the idea of wanting to make a stop motion game,” Tillmann says while citing that the first steps he and …]]></summary>

The game continues to impress with each passing look, earning its spot as the "Most Anticipated Game" at The Game Awards 2023.
The world of Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is broken into various regions, which seamlessly blend into one another. After the intro sequence, players enter into the Grasslands, a grassy area south of Midgar. From there, you travel to Junon, a vast open area in the shadow of Shinra's military; this area also features chocobos that can climb up cliffsides.

It's no secret that I've spent a lot of time playing, seeing, talking about, and writing about Final Fantasy VII Rebirth. Having traveled to Japan to spend two days in Square Enix's Tokyo headquarters with demos and interviews, then reporting on it through our previous issue's cover story and subsequent exclusive coverage hub, I already had an idea that I would be a fan of what Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, the second entry in the Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy, brings to the table. However, after coming out of the hours-long gameplay session and another conversation with director Naoki Hamag…]]></summary>

During today's PlayStation State of Play devoted to the upcoming exclusive title, we got a new look at various impactful scenes set to take place in this retelling of the middle portion of the Final Fantasy VII Remake series. 
The footage in this trailer shows off various scenes we haven't yet witnessed and characters we've seen very little of. The main thrust is Sephiroth's quest for the Black Materia and the party's efforts to save the world. As you might imagine, it's all set to the amazing soundtrack fans have come to expect from the game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Project Orion is still a deeply mysterious game. We know it is a follow-up to Cyberpunk 2077, we know CD Projekt Red is developing the game in North America (Boston, specifically) as opposed to Poland where the main studio is based, and eventually development will expand to Vancouver, with support from the main Polish headquarters. Beyond those details, we don't know much. Implications from CD Projekt point to it being a sequel, but it could be a spin-off, or something entirely different. Of note, Project Orion was a study from the 50s and 60s about the viability of nuclear power for space travel. Maybe that's what CD Projekt's Cyberpunk 2077 follow-up will be about.
We may not know much about the game, but based on a press release from CD Projekt this morning, we now know some of the folks who will be working on it. Dan Hernberg is now a Project Orion executive producer who was head of production at Amazon Games, and also has history at Panic Button and Blizzard Entertainment.  Ryan Barnard was a game director at Massive Entertainment and Ubisoft, but perhaps most notably, was the gameplay director at Hitman for developer IO Interactive. Barnard is joining Project Orion as a design director. Alan Villani is now an engineering director on Project Orion and worked on several Mortal Kombat titles. Anna Megill is a Project Orion lead writer with history on titles like Control, Dishonored: Death of The Outsider, Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, Guild Wars 2, and the upcoming Fable from Playground Games. Alexander Freed is an additional writer on Project Orion and is a New York Times bestselling novelist and comic book writer who previously worked at Bioware on Star Wars: The Old Republic and more.
We're eager to learn more about Project Orion, but suspect it will be some time before we do. For more on Cyberpunk 2077, follow the link to read Game Informer's review of Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty. You can also read about how CD Projekt has no interest in being acquired here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo has released its latest quarterly sales numbers, and they are overall expectedly impressive considering 2023 saw the releases of new mainline Zelda and Mario games. But Pikmin 4 and Super Mario RPG, the remake of the 1996 Super Nintendo game, also delivered some notable sales numbers.
You can find the full report here, but here are the notable highlights:
The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom has sold 20.28 million copies since its launch on May 12, 2023
Pikmin 4 has sold 3.33 million copies since its launch on July 21, 2023
Super Mario Bros Wonder has sold 11.96 million copies since its launch on October 20, 2023
Super Mario RPG has sold 3.14 million copies since its launch on November 17, 2023
Other highlights, found here, include Switch hardware sales, which have reached 139.36 million units. It's also always interesting to watch the list of best-selling Switch games, which you can find here. Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is still king, now boasting 60.58 million units sold. Animal Crossing: New Horizons is in a distant second with 44.79 million units sold and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is in third with 33.67 million units sold. The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Super Mario Odyssey take fourth and fifth place, respectively.
Nintendo also confirmed what we all suspected, writing in its report, "The Super Mario Bros. Movie, released in April, had a positive impact on sales of Mario related titles. As a result, there were 24 titles that sold over a million copies during the period, including titles from other software publishers." It also mentions in the report that Super Mario Bros. Wonder is the fastest-selling Super Mario title to date.

Years ago, when I first heard about the provocative title for Rocksteady’s follow-up to the Arkham games, I recall wondering what mental gymnastics were in store to not actually murder the well-liked central characters of the DC mythos, including the version of Batman the studio had so expertly developed over prior titles. Credit where it’s due: Rocksteady followed through, and Kill the Justice League does just that. Unfortunately, it also killed my interest or enthusiasm through a story that feels juvenile and…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft had a strong start to 2024 thanks to their Developer Direct Showcase, but it sounds like we'll get even more information on what the gaming giant is up to very soon. Head of Xbox Phil Spencer gathered the attention of gamers everywhere this afternoon with a post announcing an upcoming "business update event." You can see the post for yourself below.
We're listening and we hear you. We've been planning a business update event for next week, where we look forward to sharing more details with you about our vision for the future of Xbox. Stay tuned.
February 5, 2024
The post itself doesn't have any concrete details on what to expect, but there's a likely subject. Just this morning, The Verge reported that Indiana Jones and The Great Circle, one of Xbox's biggest first-party games of the year, might be headed to PlayStation after a short exclusivity window. Combined with other recent rumors, like Hi-Fi Rush and Starfield coming to other platforms, it seems like Xbox might be loosening its grip on its exclusive games. That said, Spencer didn't give us any idea as to what the announcement would be about, so we'll have to wait until next week to know for sure.
For more on Xbox's plans for the coming year, check out some of the reveals from the Developer Direct, like Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, Visions of Mana, and Avowed.

In addition to touting an AI learning opponent feature for Master Duel and VR experience with Duel Links, a collection of classic Yu-Gi-Oh titles served as the big new game announcement.
Dubbed Yu-Gi-Oh! Early Days Collection, this compilation consists of the very first Yu-Gi-Oh games ever released, including titles only available in Japan. Konami only revealed one game in the collection: Yu-Gi-Oh Duel Monsters 4: Battle of Great Duelists for the Game Boy Color, which launched in Japan in 2000 and never came to the West. 
Yu-Gi-Oh Early Days Collection has no release window, but it will be available for Switch and PC via Steam. Konami plans to announce the other titles in the collection in the future, so you can start building your wishlist now. There are a ton of Yu-Gi-Oh games (to say the least), but as a long-time fan, I’ll be happy if Forbidden Memories, The Eternal Duelist Soul, or (perhaps less likely) The Duelists of the Roses make the cut.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is one of the biggest Xbox exclusives on the horizon. According to a new report, however, Microsoft might be thinking of bringing Indy to other platforms.
The Verge has spoken to an insider familiar with Microsoft’s plans who claims the publisher is considering the idea of bringing several first-party titles to other consoles, like releasing Indiana Jones on the PlayStation 5. The source claims that Bethesda is tentatively targeting a December release for the title and that it will launch as an Xbox/PC title before possibly coming to PlayStation 5 after a short exclusivity window. 


Remember that nothing has been officially announced or confirmed, so take this report with a grain of salt. It’s worth noting, though, that during Microsoft’s trial with the FTC over its acquisition of Activision Blizzard, Bethesda’s then head of publishing, Pete Hines, testified that parent company ZeniMax had initially signed an agreement with Disney to make Indiana Jones a multiplatform game. Microsoft later amended this deal to make the game an Xbox exclusive after it acquired ZeniMax in 2020, with Hines explaining the decision was made in the name of "reducing risk and trying to get a degree of clarity."
Microsoft’s rumored multi-platform approach has garnered plenty of speculation in recent months. The publisher is reportedly looking to bring first-party games like Hi-Fi Rush and Sea of Thieves to rival platforms in the near future. Starfield is also rumored for a PS5 launch, as reported by XboxEra. 
Indiana Jones and the Great Circle was first announced in 2021 and had its full reveal during the Xbox Developer Direct last month. The first-person action-adventure romp stars Troy Baker as Indy in a story set between Raiders of the Lost Ark and The Last Crusade. The game is slated to launch sometime this year for Xbox Series X/S and PC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In 2022, Paramount+ finally released the first season of Halo, the long-awaited live-action adaptation of the popular video game franchise. While various action scenes served as fan-pleasing sequences, the series was maligned among the community for simply not feeling true to the source material. In addition to focusing on too many side characters and interpersonal drama, the series also took far too many liberties with its main protagonist, Master Chief. With Season 2 starting on Paramount+ this week, I sat down with Xbox's head of IP expansion and entertainment Kiki Wolfkill and Halo Season 2 showrunner and writer David Wiener to learn more about the direction they're taking.
According to Wolfkill, who has worked on the Halo series since her role as executive producer on Halo 4 in 2012, …]]></summary>

It’s packed with 40 new features, 80 changes, and almost 150 fixes. In the upcoming weeks we will share more posts explaining some of these features in depth. For now, we need your help testing our work. We need as many people as possible to test this beta version of the 14.X release series, so you can find and we can squash as many bugs as possible before the actual release. To guide you a bit towards what you should be looking for: Generic gameplay bugs and crashes. There is a new Ship Pathfinder; test it out. Buoys are optional to use. You can now automatically unbunch your vehicles at a depot. We added our own interpretation of daylength to the game. More on this soon in another blog post. There are many GUI improvements throughout the game. More consistent look, better GUI scaling. There are many more things worth talking about, and this will be made more clear when we approach the release of 14.0. But for now, play the game, and please report any issues you find. The usual titlegame competition has also been announced on the forums. See the page for the exact competition rules if you are interested. Download Changelog Bug tracker]]></summary>
