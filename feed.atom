Peanut butter and jelly. Batman and Robin. Video games and bugs. There are just some things that go together. It doesn't matter how good or how polished a video game is — these days, it's nearly impossible to get through one without encountering a bug in one way or another, even if we don't realize it. Even in games that get a ton of continued support after launch, like Stardew Valley, which also happens to be one of my most played and loved games of all time, it's inevitable to encounter a glitch every now and again.
Squashing bugs in game development often becomes a race against a deadline as more and more issues pop up, and it seems increasingly common these days that games are shipping with glaring issues because they can simply be fixed with…]]></summary>

Tribute Games' radical throwback brawler TMNT: Shredder's Revenge has made a surprise arrival on mobile platforms — But while the Heroes in a Half-Shell are now readily available to download on Android and iOS platforms, the game itself is only accessible to Netflix subscribers.
It would appear that the 2022 scrapper, a love letter to the TMNT arcade titles of yore, is the newest release in the burgeoning Netflix Games division, and as such requires a Netflix sub to play the title at all. One would assume that this also applies to online modes of Shredder's Revenge, so hopefully you have three pals all subbed to the streaming service if you want some handheld multiplayer action.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qcaEQVBcY0&ab_channel=Netflix
TMNT: Shredder's Revenge sees the fab four team with Channel 9 reporter April O'Neil, sensei Master Splinter, and sporting goods vigilante Casey Jones on a mission to stop The Shredder and his Foot Clan from taking over The Big Apple. The game features a huge variety of cameos and references to Eastman and Laird's iconic 1987 TV series — including appearances from Bebop & Rocksteady, The Rat King, Irma, Vernon, and the Teenagers from Dimension X.
The mobile port is not currently in parity with the PC and console releases, sitting just one update behind. So while not all of the game's bugs and issues have been ironed out for the mobile port, the majority of features and modes are all present and ready to rock. For our thoughts on the original release, check out our full review right here.
TMNT: Shredder's Revenge is available now on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and mobile platforms.

Bayonetta 3 came and conquered, but Platinum Games has been infrequently tweaking the game since its October 2022 release.

So there's a few things this patch addresses:
Combat adjustments that mainly apply to Viola
Nerfs to many Niflheim challenge stages (which a lot of people asked for, even on higher-end difficulties)

The Switch is home to enough turn-based tactics games to last a lifetime, but that hasn't deterred Mipumi, the studio behind the point and click adventure The Lion's Song, from working on a title which looks to stand out from the rest.
Howl is set to land on Switch later this year (we can't be more specific than 'early 2023' at the moment), but this tactical wolf hunter has managed to attract our interest. Based on the newly-released gameplay video (above) the title has all of the howlmarks (sorry) of your classic turn-based adventure - predict your enemy's moves, shift your character, plan you attack - but where Howl stands out is in its 'living ink' visuals which make each movement look like a watercolour painting come to life.

Yes, its side-scrolling action is so buttery smooth it should come with a cholesterol warning. Its soundtrack is sublime. It looks gorgeous. But for me, the chewiest bit is the story.

Several months ago we learned that Return to Dream Land is coming to the Switch in 2023 as Kirby's Return to Dream Land Deluxe, and we haven't heard much about it since. That changes today, as we have new copy ability reveals: the best kind of Kirby reveals.
The announcement come by way of two tweets, both of which are from the Nintendo UK account. The first one confirms "Sand," a new copy ability coming to Kirby's Return to Dream Land Deluxe, which allows Kirby to "shift sand into a variety of shapes, from a fist to a castle, and take on even the toughest foes." So like the Spider-Man villain Sandman? That sounds rad. The other is actually a returning copy ability that hails from Kirby Star Allies. It's none other than "Festival," which is a dancing-based ability that's kind of like an ultimate (think screen-freezing mass damage).
https://twitter.com/NintendoUK/status/1613102374154866688
I'm ready to return to Dream Land
It's crazy to think that 11 years later this game is making a grand return, but I couldn't be happier. Return to Dream Land Deluxe deserves a bigger spotlight, and it'll get it on the Switch: which has its massive (and growing) install base. Also, to be frank, it'll be easier to replay it on the Switch (though I still have my Wii U [which I use!] hooked up out of respect [and to play old Wii games!]).

The retro-inspired market went from novel to heavily saturated rather quickly, and now they’ve been their own corner of the industry for over a decade. It’s a rather difficult corner to stand out in. It’s a pretty busy corner.
For my money, it’s a precarious balancing act between building off designs and mechanics of the era, while also finding a memorable identity. You can make Contra again, and if you do a good job, that can be good enough. But you can’t stand with the big boys unless you bring your own pants. Or something. I sometimes just hork up analogies and hope they make sense.
With Oniken, Odallus, and Blazing Chrome under their belt, JoyMasher has tried on a few pairs of pants in their years. Really, though, those games harken rather heavily toward their influences.  …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stepping back in time.
Making any video game is exceptionally hard work. But creating a retro-style experience that feels 100% authentic to the source inspiration adds a whole extra layer of difficulty. Implementing pixel art visuals and calling it a day just doesn't cut it, but what developer JoyMasher has done with Vengeful Guardian: Moonrider is truly remarkable. Much like its previous effort with Blazing Chrome, the team has successfully created a 2D action title that looks, sounds, and plays like it came straight from the early ‘90s, down to the exceptional environmental detail and enemy design.
Inspired by the likes of Shinobi III: Return of the Ninja Master and Strider, Vengeful Guardian: Moonrider is a sci-fi action platformer in which you take on the role of the titular Moonrider, a cybernetic ninja who rejects its intended purpose as a tool to preserve a totalitarian state and instead wages war against its creators. After making your way through the opening level (we recommend playing through the excellent tutorial section, too), you’ll have a choice of six additional stages to tackle in whichever order you see fit, followed by two final stages to round out the experience. Each stage houses its own boss character and beating each of these will grant you a new ability. Very similar to Mega Man in many ways, then.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From start to finish, High on Life is a riot of a time. The game’s unique, wise-cracking guns, fun platforming, and Rick and Morty-esque humor combine for about 16 hours of gaming time well spent. That said, once the campaign wraps up and you’ve explored some of the hidden areas, there isn’t a whole lot else to do.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Switch is also the top-selling hardware.
Famitsu has released its annual sales charts for 2022, and Pokémon Scarlet & Violet — unsurprisingly — has topped the year's sales, selling an incredible 4,338,931 units since its release in November (thanks, Nintendo Everything!).
If you've been following the headlines and the weekly Japanese charts, then this won't come as a surprise to you. Pokémon always does well — in 2021, Brilliant Diamond & Shining Pearl was the second best-selling game of the year, for example. Scarlet & Violet sold over 2.5 million copies in its first week, and the momentum hasn't really stopped.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's dangerous to go 'lone.
Though it flew under a lot of radars, Cuddle Monster Games’ Hell is Other Demons was a standout platform shooter of 2019, featuring razor-sharp, ultra-tough action gameplay alongside a delicious neon aesthetic. Considering it was mostly the work of just one man by the name of Hannes Rahm, Hell is Other Demons was an impressive achievement and a great example of a niche classic. Rahm's latest project is Lone Ruin, which feels in a lot of ways like a spiritual successor to that initial release. That same dark atmosphere and intense gameplay are present, but now things play out in 3D. Though Lone Ruin doesn’t feel like it quite meets the bar its predecessor set, it still manages to be a raucously good time while it lasts.
Lone Ruin is all about the gameplay, which is equal parts thrilling and simple. A typical run involves you entering a room, clearing out all waves of enemies, collecting the reward (if you survive), then moving on to the next room. Most enemies go down after just a few shots, but the tricky part comes in with how easily you can get swarmed by them. Some enemies can shoot lasers and projectiles while others may explode on contact, and when things really heat up, there’s scarcely a square inch of space to be found onscreen where your character won’t be hurt. Luckily, your character is pretty light on their feet, and they also have a dash move on a small cooldown that can grant a few i-frames of respite while you reposition.

The original Xenonauts was an excellent homage to the hyphenated school of X-COMs / UFO: Enemy Unknowns of old, so I'm feeling pretty pumped to find out how its sequel builds on its classic, squad-based tactics.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA['I guess we really are The Last of Us Part I'
Following a frankly obnoxious amount of media build-up and endless think-pieces, HBO finally previewed its live-action adaptation of The Last of Us to an army of critics, who have been overwhelmingly positive in their response to the grim-looking televisual take of the hit game series.
The new series currently sits at an incredible 97% on the review aggregate site Rotten Tomatoes, with a score calculated from a total of 60 media reviews. The long-in-development series, which will debut on the HBO network next week, sees beleaguered protagonists Joel Miller (Pedro Pascal) and Ellie (Bella Ramsey) pick their way through a dilapidated shell of the United States, attempting to stay one step ahead of thieving marauders and the terrifying mutated humans known as "Clickers."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLtkt8BonwM&ab_channel=HBOMax
The HBO TV adaptation was first announced back in 2020, a seemingly snug fit for a game series so beholden to its distinct cinematic style. The show is produced by a litany of companies including Sony Pictures, Word Games, Naughty Dog, and the recently founded PlayStation Productions. The show itself is written by Craig Mazin, the Emmy award-winning creator of equally grim series Chernobyl, and Neil Druckmann, the writer of the video game iterations of The Last of Us and The Last of Us Part II.
If you're looking forward to the new show, then you won't have too much longer to wait. The first episode will air this Sunday, January 15, on HBO and HBO Max. In the UK, The Last of Us will air at 02:00 BST on Monday mornings via Sky Atlantic and NOW TV, to coincide with the U.S. timeslot. Don't fret staying up, as each episode will be made available on demand after its respective premiere.
We're about to hit a whole new wave of Last of Us discourse, folks. Batten down the fuckin' hatches.

Every breathtaking thing down there, from jellyfish to giant squids to killer whales, either wants to kill you (see killer whales) or is so frigidly indifferent to human existence that it might as well want you dead. After all, you might be able to scare off a predator, but there’s no negotiating with an ocean current.
Aquatico promises city-building enthusiasts a deep dive into this nearly untapped environ (nearly untapped, I’ll get into that later) but while this game delivers on the ocean’s beauty, it’s disappointingly light on peril.

The new record was set by Jhay — who actually broke his own world record by 4.4 seconds. Now the record sits at 2:54:51.33 in the Any% (With Bank). What does Any% (With Bank) actually mean? It's a particular category that means you don't have to do or collect everything, just simply beat the game, but the only requirement is that you need to use the Bank Toad to unlock the final galaxy.

We are just over a month away from the release of Kirby's Return to Dream Land Deluxe, and the team over at HAL Laboratory has started drip-feeding us new additions to the game. The most prominent of these is the reveal of Kirby's new Copy Abilities - power-ups gained after inhaling an enemy. We already knew of the Mecha ability from the first trailer, but it looks like a whole lot more is on the way.
Shared via @NintendoUK, the game will introduce a new 'Sand' Copy Ability for the pink puffball. This power-up will allow Kirby the chance to manipulate the environment into protective shelter, or blast enemies with granular attacks.

This was spotted by the Twitter bot, NinStatusBot - which shares information about Nintendo's maintenance and server outages. Given we're a week out from the release of Fire Emblem Engage, it's not all that surprising. In saying this, it's not often you see scheduled maintenance this early.

But recently, I've found myself bored by straight up-and-down deckbuilders. A lot of them feel very similar, and while there are plenty of good games playing with the same ideas, I've started actively seeking out deckbuilders with slightly bigger ideas.
And if it's big ideas you want, Backpack Hero is your new best friend. This early-access roguelike is one of the most inventive deckbuilders I've ever played.
What are ya buyin', stranger?

Within my all-encompassing obsession with farming/community simulators, there is yet another obsession, like the layers to an onion: I cannot stop playing the fishing mini-games. My current Stardew Valley save is set on the fishing-friendly river farm, most of my Dreamlight Valley villagers give me a fishing bonus, and the aquarium was the first part of the museum that I completed in Animal Crossing: New Horizons by a country mile. In spite of my fascination with these mini games, I have next to no real-life interest in fish at all. Well, that's not quite right. I like fish, in that I enjoy the ocean and aquariums and the like, but once they leave the water it's game over.

"Nobody said a word about a PC version release," said Yoshi P, the producer on both FFXIV and FFXVI. "Why is it like a PC version is releasing 6 months later? Don't worry about that, buy a PS5!" he said, laughing.

We've been working under the assumption that Final Fantasy 16 would come to PC after a period of PlayStation 5 exclusivity, but in fairness, that's because that's what the Final Fantasy 16 trailers have said would happen.

The newest patch for Marvel Snap is live, adding some new locations and balancing several cards. Galactus, Leader, and a few other are among the primary fixes in this latest update, as the Marvel Snap team is keeping an eye on their power level.
In the latest update notes, Marvel Snap developer Second Dinner outlines how the patch affects some of the common deck archetypes. Cards like Galactus, Leader, and Aero are cards worthy of building a deck around, and they've seen some bumps in popularity.
Galactus specifically moves from a 6/3 to a 6/2, slightly adjusting his power. The balance team says that even at the highest ranks of play, Galactus is seeing "concerningly high" win rates, and they'll be keeping an eye on the world-eater as time goes on.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Never doubt the power of the Steam Sale
Valve has announced that its popular PC retail platform, Steam, smashed a major record this past weekend, surpassing 10 million concurrent in-game players for the first time in the platform's near 20-year history.
The mighty number was achieved on Saturday, January 7, with a peak high of 10,082,055 Steam users in-game. That's not sitting idle, or just logged in, but actively playing in one of the hundreds of thousands of titles in the Steam library. On Sunday, January 8, this figure was further surpassed, with a peak player count of 10,284,568. In addition to breaking the active player record, Steam also beat out its current record for overall concurrent users, with a weekend high of 33,078,963.
That's a lot of people grinding for trading cards.
Steam typically hits high figures during the winter period, mostly due to the advent of its annual, wallet-munching Steam sale. This period is then followed by a plethora of users playing their new games, spending holiday gift vouchers, or simply chilling during their time away from work, school, or college. This latest winter, in addition, will have seen many in possession of a shiny new Steam Deck remaining logged in and/or playing while on the go, which no doubt also helped pushed these numbers into new frontiers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Take the horror home with you
Signalis was one of the best games of 2022, and it's certainly one of the best horror titles that's come out in the past few years. While the title was sadly left out of the conversation for a lot of awards at the end of last year, it's grown a steady cult following with fans — I can see it being one of those games that's only appreciated more and more as time goes on. We're off to a good start though, because pre-orders are now up for physical editions of Signalis for the Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4.
The physical edition will run players $29.99 (Signalis pre-orders are currently listed online at Amazon, GameStop, Best Buy, Walmart, and Target in the US), but Humble Games is sweetening the deal by adding in an extra bonus item for players to enjoy: a holographic replica polaroid, which is a key item in the actual game. I'd love to see Signalis get some fancy special edition releases in the future (maybe for an anniversary down the line or something), but for now this physical edition should make for a great collector's piece.
https://twitter.com/LastStarfarer/status/1611439084328583168
Here at Destructoid we're huge fans of Signalis — Eric Van Allen gave it a 9.5/10 score in his review, and I even chronicled my own experience playing the game, and how it's helped me confront my fear of horror games. If you've been on the fence about giving this title a try, now's the perfect opportunity to get in there and check it out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Damages estimated at "tens of millions of yen".
A number of burglaries at trading card stores have been reported in Tokyo, Japan, as a result of the rising popularity and value of Pokémon cards. Since last summer, Japan Times reports that damages from these burglaries are estimated to be around tens of millions of yen.
According to an investigative source, there have been unprecedented five cases where the main target has been trading cards — and the Pokémon Trading Card Game is usually involved. The Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department has reported on one specific case, where 60 cards — worth a staggering ¥8.5 million — were stolen from a store in Machida, a city located in the western part of Tokyo.

There's an art to a good video game demo. How do you make a slice of a game available to prospective buyers that's both representative of the final product and small enough that they still want to buy it? A video game is interactive, so a perfect "trailer" for a game should also be interactive, but how do you ensure that you're not showing your whole hand? A movie trailer can include a curated slice of narrative, but a demo must include a curated slice of gameplay, just enough to hook the player without handing them a full game. It's a delicate balancing act.
These days, it feels like the "demo" is in an interesting place. Very few AAA titles put in the work to offer up an interesting demo of any kind. In the rare instances that they're available, the playable advertiseme…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Grab your dartboard.
Another year, another round of 'New Nintendo Switch Pro/2/+/On/Up/Over' rumours. Whispers of new or updated Switch hardware have been doing the rounds since practically the launch of the console back in 2017, and the start of 2023 has brought with it a fresh round of speculation as to when exactly Nintendo will debut its next video game console.
Announcing and launching new hardware are two very different things, of course, but Switch will soon be entering its seventh year on store shelves and it's getting to the point where, based on the evidence of past console cycles, official news of a true successor can't be too far off — even given Nintendo's willingness to subvert expectations, to leave Sony and Microsoft to fight over hardware specs since the Wii era, and to lean into its catalogue of evergreen games which keep its hardware selling well into its twilight years.

Aang and the gang are getting a new video game adaptation, heading straight to phones. Avatar Generations is a new free-to-play mobile RPG set to arrive in early 2023 for Android and iPhone, with pre-registration open now.
Based on the Nickelodeon animated series Avatar: The Last Airbender, Generations retells the journey of Aang and friends across the Four Nations. Battles take place in turn-based squad formation, letting players build their own team to tackle enemies.
Plenty of beloved characters look set to return, too. The obvious suspects, like Aang, Zuko, Toph, Katara, and Sokka, are all here. But so are Suki, Gyatso, Princess Yue, and others from through The Last Airbender. A new gameplay trailer released today shows them all in action:

Bitmap Books, publisher of the fantastic "Visual Compendium" range, has regretfully canceled its long-delayed volume Sega Mega Drive: A Visual Compendium, following legal fallout from Sega itself.
The new tome would have been the eighth release in the popular Bitmap Books series, following on from editions on platforms such as the Atari 2600, Commodore 64, Commodore Amiga, NES, and SNES. The sleek, hefty books feature a plethora of visual material from each platform's archives, ranging from sprites and stages to boxart and marketing materials. Sega had originally backed Bitmap Books for a Sega Master System edition, but seemingly would not close the same deal for its 16-bit counterpart.

Meta has announced that it is winding down support for the first iteration of its Quest VR technology. In an email obtained by UploadVR, Meta explained how the changes will affect Quest 1 users from spring forward.
Quest 1 user will still be able to use all of the currently available apps and hardware, but no new features will be included in Quest 1 updates and the compatibility of apps moving forward is not guaranteed. Additionally, as of March, Quest 1 users will no longer be able to create or join parties, and will lose all access to the Meta Horizon Home features. So no more visiting your virtual pals or inviting them over to your virtual abode.
Meta notes that it will continue to roll out critical bug fixes and security patches until 2024.
Released in 2019 as the successor to Oculus GO, Quest launched in the spring of 2019 at a retail price of $400. It would be superseded in fall 2020 by Quest 2. A side iteration, Quest Pro, was launched at the end of last year, with Meta tentatively suggesting that its next technology, Quest 3, will arrive at some point later this year.
Sony's own virtual reality technology, PSVR2, is set to launch worldwide on PS5 February 23.

We are just two weeks out from the launch of Square Enix' fantasy adventure Forspoken, and the publisher is ramping up its marketing drive with an evocative new cinematic trailer, spotlighting our hero, Frey, and the challenges that she faces in both this world and the next.
In the short cinematic, we see Frey on the run in two distinctly different scenarios, one in the avenues and alleyways of New York City, and then in the jungles and desert plains of the mysterious nation of Athia. Regardless of the terrain, the threat, and the motivation, Frey's goal remains the same: Survival. And, ultimately, when her back is against the wall, she will have no option but face her pursuers, and turn the hunters into the hunted.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6goMdDb4UQ&ab_channel=SquareEnix
Forspoken is an open-world fantasy adventure developed by Luminous Productions. While its protagonist is intriguing, its world lush and vibrant, and its visual effects sharp and dazzling, the incoming release is struggling to light the hype fires as its publisher might have hoped. It has, admittedly, become incredibly trendy to rag on this game, but I'm personally willing to give the game the benefit of the doubt, for now.
Still, optimism will only carry a title so far, and the truth will out soon enough when Forspoken finally makes it into the hands of the players.
Forspoken launches January 24 on PS5 and PC. Check out Chris Carter's thoughts on the demo here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Chosen One.
Next month, Tales of Symphonia returns to a Nintendo console when Tales of Symphonia Remastered launches on Switch (and other platforms) on 17th February. Ahead of that date, Bandai Namco and Nintendo have shared a gameplay trailer to bring newcomers up to speed on what to expect, and get long-time fans excited to dive back into a GameCube classic.
The new trailer will be familiar to those who've played the original on GameCube back in 2003. There are snippets of gameplay — from exploring towns to delving into dungeons (and yes, RPG fans, there's a sewer dungeon in there). But the big focus of the trailer is, understandably, the game's action combat.

Following the incredible global success of Capcom's Street Fighter II, it didn't take any time at all before the market was awash in one-on-one fighters, fast eclipsing the scrolling beat-'em-ups and shmups that had dominated the scene leading into the 1990s. All of a sudden, seemingly every developer pivoted to competitive fisticuffs, with seemingly hundreds of Street Fighter-alikes hitting arcade centers — many featuring developers and IPs seemingly plucked out of thin air.
And while a few of these releases would carve out a piece of the pugilistic pie for themselves — such as Mortal Kombat and eventually The King of Fighters, there was a whole wave of titles that fell by the wayside. In most cases, this either came down to the games being poorly produced o…]]></summary>

Too many mods got waylaid in Planet Half-Life screenshot roundup hell by a desire to make everything expansive and professional-grade. So I'm delighted by a mod for 2017's Star Wars Battlefront 2 which knows its core: it is funny to see dinosaurs do things that dinosaurs shouldn't be doing. So the JurassicFront replaces character models with dinosaurs, and away you go, shooting dinos around Naboo and the Death Star. That's the joke.

Epic Games took to the @FortniteStatus Twitter account yesterday to announce that a period of game downtime was scheduled for this morning (10th January) to fix several mechanical issues. The maintenance was performed as planned and the Fortnite serves are now back online.
Of the many issues that the patch set out to tackle, the most prominent was with the recently-added Shockwave Hammer - a new weapon which had an easily exploited glitch to remove its cooldown period (thanks, Eurogamer). Ever since the weapon's addition in last month's Chapter 4 update, the hammer became a fan-favourite, but it was quickly removed from the game ('vaulted', as the kids say) for its glitches.

We knew it was coming, but it's something else entirely to see it in flashing neon lights on an official Xbox blog. Persona 3 Portable, Persona 4 Golden, and Monster Hunter Rise are all coming to Xbox Game Pass the week of January 16.
As Microsoft has now fully confirmed, none of these are seemingly delayed, and will arrive next week. All three marquee games are coming to the service with all platforms in tow, including cloud play; as well as on consoles and PC. Good luck to all of you who are playing these for the first time! They're each a massive time sink, but are worth it.
Here are the games coming to Xbox Game Pass in January of 2023
Persona 3 Portable, January 19 (Cloud, Console, and PC)
Persona 4 Golden, January 19 (Cloud, Console, and PC)
Monster Hunter Rise, January 20 (Cloud, Console, and PC)
Here are the games leaving Xbox Game Pass on January 15, 2023
There's a few big things leaving the service around the same time, however. Losing Danganronpa in any capacity is going to hurt. Then there's Nobody Saves the World (which was a timed console exclusive for the Xbox ecosystem), and the generally beloved Windjammers 2.
Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc (Cloud, Console, and PC)
Nobody Saves The World (Cloud, Console, and PC)
Pupperazzi (Cloud, Console, and PC)
The Anacrusis (Game Preview) (Cloud, Console, and PC)
We Happy Few (Cloud, Console, and PC)
Windjammers 2 (Cloud, Console, and PC)

Atari has shared some brand-new visuals for the return of its once-lost classic, Akka Arrh, which is being produced and completed by the legendary British game designer, Jeff Minter.
The shmup, created by Mike Hally and Dave Ralston, was originally due to be released in arcades in 1982 but was scrapped as it was considered too difficult during a test. This rerelease was announced back in December 2022; the unfinished prototype was included in Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration, but this new version — due to launch sometime this year — will be the complete package.

The next 12 months is set to be a banner year for interstellar adventuring, and kicking us off in just under four weeks time on February 2nd is KeokeN Interactive's Deliver Us Mars. As I found out last year, Deliver Us Mars looks like it's going to be quite the step up from its prequel, Deliver Us The Moon, both in terms of its cerebral, pulse-racing puzzle-solving, and its shift from a silent, first-person protagonist to fully-voiced, third-person heroine, Kathy Johanson - a fact that game director and co-founder Koen Deetman tells me has been long in the making. 
"You have to bear in mind that Deliver Us The Moon was our debut into the games industry," he tells me. "We’d envisioned multiple ways to make this the greatest game of all time, but to some extent you are bound by reality and what you can make within a budget and timeline, so some of these decisions were made out of necessity. That’s why the narrative and its scale has significantly risen with Deliver Us Mars – we’ve had the opportunity to give that side of the game a lot of more of our time and attention."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Surprisingly affordable, starting at $400.
Since the Switch launched back in 2017, we've seen an influx of powerful, dedicated handheld systems that many have deemed to be 'rivals' to Nintendo's hybrid platform. We prefer to view them simply as alternative devices to potentially suit a wide range of gaming preferences, with products like the Steam Deck and the Aya Neo Next providing relatively approachable (albeit often quite expensive) solutions if you're after something to go alongside your Switch.
The latest premium handheld device to hit the market comes via hardware company Razer, which recently announced a release date of January 26th, 2023 for its portable Android and streaming console, dubbed the Razer Edge. Reservations can currently be made on the official Razer website for a fee of $5, with the prices starting at $399.99.

SNK has offered up some exciting news for its excellent tag-fighter The King of Fighters XV — Not only do we now know that new DLC character Shingo Yabuki will be returning as soon as next week, but the developer also revealed two more characters coming our way in 2023: The crime-fighting vigilante Najd and the terrifying Sylvie Paula Paula!
In an update the KoF XV's Season 2 roadmap, SNK revealed that its first DLC drop, consisting of Shingo Yabuki and a meaty balance overhaul, will go live on all platforms on January 17. The Kyo Kusanagi fanboy will be followed in the spring by veteran Fatal Fury star and bringer of JUSTICE Kim Kaphwan. Around this time, SNK also hopes to launch a beta for its crossplay servers, which are expected to officially open at some point later this summer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iuv9bxAVRCQ&ab_channel=SNKOFFICIAL
And speaking of the season, those warm winter months will see the return of KoF XIV debutantes Najd and Sylvie Paula Paula. Najd, as you might remember, was the winning entry in a "Design a Character" competition held by SNK back in 2018. As such, to see the mysterious vigilante make their return pays tribute to their designer, artist Mashael Al-Barrak. The absolute MENACE Sylvie Paula Paula is an incredibly loud, boisterous, and colorful NESTS operative, whose obnoxiously cutesy ways and dopey visage belies a dangerous killer instinct and literally electrifying fighting skills.
Honestly? Stoked to see her again.
Two further characters will launch in Fall and Winter 2023, respectively, to round out Season 2.
The King of Fighters XV is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox Series X platforms.

Masahiro Sakurai, the brilliant mind behind a library-full of our favourite Nintendo titles, has moved onto another development story in his latest YouTube video. This time, the discussion is all about Kirby Air Ride as the legendary creator discusses how the idea came to be, development challenges and the game's lasting influence today.
Air Ride was something of a sharp turn for the Kirby series (especially given its release around the time of the more conventional GBA titles Kirby: Nightmare in Dream Land and Kirby & the Amazing Mirror), but we think it's fair to say that this wacky racer twist on the pink puffball format worked.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good things come to those who wait
Fans of the modern classic farming simulator that is Stardew Valley, and likely its massive 1.5 update which added mountains of new content to the game, will be thrilled to hear that the expansion is finally available on mobile platforms. The update first released on PC back in 2020, and mobile players have been asking when they'll get a chance to check it out ever since. Eric Barone, the solo developer behind the title, tweeted out on January 6th that the 1.5 update had been submitted for review on iOS and Android platforms. The update had some issues in its first few days as players reported various bugs, but Barone has already rolled out at least one patch to fix the most glaring problems.
https://twitter.com/ConcernedApe/status/1611612814271184899
It's easy to miss, but in the thread of replies following that initial tweet, Barone said that the re-write of the game's app that was required to make the 1.5 update work should make things "easier to update mobile in the future (for 1.6 and who knows...)." We have no idea what the 1.6 update would entail — it could simply be more basic bug fixes, although the fans (myself included) would be happy to guess that it's another content update, or maybe even multiplayer.
Either way, it's great to see Barone still has plenty of love to give to his debut title, even as he's working on another upcoming release, Haunted Chocolatier.

Of course, this is in large part due to the fact that HBO's adaptation of the series is coming up in less than a week now, and conversations about the televised take on the first game have been swirling for months. As a long time mega fan of the series, I'll have a lot of feelings to parse through once it's finally out, but until then, I can focus on the fun that's popping up around the series right now, like this mod that makes Ellie in The Last of Us Part II look exactly like Bella Ramsey, who is portraying the beloved character in HBO's live action versi…]]></summary>

The Matrix was red hot when I was in high school. I remember the anticipation my friends and I had for the upcoming Matrix Reloaded.

Matrix Revolutions kind of just nailed the coffin shut. What a dark time.
Around that time came Enter the Matrix, which probably still stands as the most ambitious attempt to tie a game into a movie series’ canon. The Wachowskis were heavily involved, the live-action cutscenes had the same look as the movie, and parts of the plot were heavily extrapolated in the game. From a narrative perspective, it fit so well, but when it came to gameplay, well…

Overwatch 2's Battle For Olympus event is live, and a pantheon of Greek god skins have stormed the store. One skin in particular has caused a stir over the last few days though, causing players to question whether they're paying for a disadvantage.
The Medusa skin for Widowmaker is what you'd expect: Overwatch's spider-themed sniper Widowmaker in Medusa garb. She takes on a serpentine appearance and, crucially, the locks of her hair become snakes.
These snake hairs aren't just for show; they actually hiss and make noise in-match. Which is a cool feature, that also lacks some subtlety when you might want it. Brian St. Pierre, also known as competitive gamer under the handle "Kephrii", posted about this skin last week.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last month CJ reported that we might see a demo for Forspoken, Square Enix's upcoming action RPG with magic-infused parkour. A demo did indeed come out in December, but only on PS5 - and to very mixed reviews. It's a shame, because the world on show in its latest cinematic trailer looks appetisingly stylish. 
The game comes out on January 24th, so we'll know for sure soon enough.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[More Isaac for your buck
If you're keen on revisiting the Dead Space series ahead of the remake releasing this month, the Steam pre-order has a neat incentive. Pre-ordering the Dead Space remake on Steam before January 27 will net you the second game in the series, Dead Space 2, for free.
As spotted by VG247, the Steam pre-order has a special deal going. Picking up Dead Space through either its base version or slightly-more-expensive Digital Deluxe version will net you a free copy of Dead Space 2. And if you've already pre-purchased the remake, you should receive a copy of Dead Space 2.
While it might feel a bit disorienting to get the sequel to the original as a tie-in for the original's remake, this does net you two absolutely stellar sci-fi survival horror gems. The Dead Space series has garnered acclaim over the years, and for good reason. The first two are prime examples of action-oriented sci-fi horror. The third game? Well, that's a different story.

Space-based savings
It's a nice upside for those who want to dip back into the series ahead of the remake, or maybe have the second lined up to play after they finish the remake. That date isn't too far off, either. EA Motive's Dead Space is set to launch on January 27, 2023 for PC, as well as PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S.
While a remake of one of sci-fi's survival classics is already a strong pitch, survival horror fans are also probably hungry for Dead Space's return. The Callisto Protocol stumbled out of the gate at the end of 2022. And now, a remake of a major inspiration is just around the corner. It could be a big one for survival horror fans. We'll see how Isaac and the crew fare on new tech in just a few weeks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Anyone down for a 2D puzzle platformer?
YouTube personality videogamedunkey has made a name for himself on the internet with his game reviews/critiques and signature comedic style. Last year, Dunkey announced that he was going to be founding his very own games publishing studio known as Bigmode, and the news was met with mixed emotions.
It's been a little over four months since Dunkey's initial announcement, and now he has officially unveiled his first publishing partnership -- Bigmode will publish a game called Animal Well, a Metroidvania-inspired 2D puzzle platformer. Dunkey disclosed his deal with the game's developer, Billy Basso, in his newest YouTube video "Dunkey's Best of 2022." He says that the game is "one of the few at E3 [2022] that caught [his] eye," and that "it's a game coming from a very pure place of love for video games." That sentiment was one of the main reasons Dunkey cited for wanting to start a company like this in the first place, so I'm glad he's found a title to support that aligns with his values in that way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21T-Sc-TXJY
If you missed the conversation surrounding Dunkey's initial announcement of Bigmode, here's the gist: some fans were annoyed that in his announcement video, Dunkey implied that he was partially responsible for the success of games like Cuphead, Undertale, and Celeste because he promoted them on his channel. Regardless, Dunkey clearly has a strong vision of the kind of games he wants publish, and while he lacks experience on the development side of the games industry, I'm looking forward to seeing if he can carve his own path in a different part of the industry.

      <p>These days, box offices are dominated by comic-book and superhero movies from Marvel and DC. Unfortunately, while superhero movies have improved dramatically over the last decade, superheroes haven’t been as powerful in the realm of video games. In fact, nearly 40 years after the first superhero video game, many developers still struggle to create worthwhile experiences using some of the biggest names in entertainment today.</p>

It’s very in line with what the studio is known for - creating beautiful handcrafted worlds complete with stories about nature - but with Tiny Echo, instead of making an animal game featuring a group of cute critters trying to survive the brutal wilderness (and that most likely made you cry), the Stockholm team went completely left-field and created a bite-sized ethereal puzzler that deals with ghosts and spirits.

This seems to be exclusive to Valve’s storefront, as the Epic Games Store isn’t listing the offer on their pre-order page for the Dead Space remake. Oh, and even though Dead Space 2’s been available for more than a decade you’ll have to wait until the Dead Space remake goes live to play your complimentary copy.

Unlike the standard PS5 DualSense controller, however, Project Leonardo won’t be compatible with the PC when it eventually launches.


In a response to tech site Digital Trends, Sony Interactive Entertainment confirmed that the kit – which allows for extensive customisation of button layouts and joystick positioning – will be built exclusivly for the PS5, with no native support for the PC or older consoles like the PS4.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'll try not to bang on about it, but in the interests of transparency, it's important to stress how much I loathe most soulslikes. Even the name, to be frank. So when I say that I don't love Asterigos Colon Curse of the Stars, it's not as damning as it may sound.
You're Hilda, a stabby lass who, for reasons, must investigate and lift a curse from a big ol' fantasy city. By exploring its districts and stabbing lots of weird dudes. Aiding you is a network of semi-suspicious locals, and the kind of immortality that makes death more annoying than anything. It's a hybrid, really, of a Souls-ish game and a more traditional hack and slash action RPG. Regular attacks don't consume stamina, and instead of finding or buying weapons, you start out with a complete set, and swap their movesets in and out as needed. I respect that it picks and chooses soulsy elements instead of tracing over the whole design.

I also didn't know that last month the author of that poem, Julian Gough, placed it into the public domain, which according to him he's legally entitled to do because nobody at Mojang or Microsoft ever successfully got him to sign a contract.
He now says Microsoft are stonewalling any attempts to contact them about whether or not they own the copyright, and that this silence killed a piece he'd written for an unnamed "global news organisation" because they didn't want to risk drawing the ire of Microsoft's 1700 strong lawer team. That piece was actually an edited version of Gough's blog post from last month, where he explained the situation and submitted the poem to the public domain - while making multiple references to the poem being written by the universe, and also how taking psychedelics lead him to conclude that not allowing himself to be compensated would be a "blockage of the flow of love". It's a trip.

Described as a spiritual sibling to their most recent OPUS game, the brilliant Echo Of Starsong, the exact magic combo of words that made my eyes go all wide and saucer-like was "a cross between What Remains Of Edith Finch and Makoto Shinkai films", which just - you know what, I'm going to shut up now so you can watch the teaser trailer.

If you’re unfamiliar, Forge is a long-time Halo mode that allows players to create their own custom maps and modes. In the past, players used Forge to remake classic maps or remix existing ones. But Infinite’s take on Forge is more robust, allowing forgers to create maps that don’t look like they belong in Halo. No, seriously, what is Whiterun doing in Infinite?

Very quickly, though, it became apparent that, actually, there are simply loads of games the RPS Treehouse is personally excited about this year, and cor, it would be rude not to include every last one of them. I'll be upfront: there are a fair number of TBA games on here that probably aren't going to come out in 2023, but as ever, we remain hopeful and optimistic all the same. So let's dive in.

No matter what, my one constant is an FPS or 'competitive' game, I suppose. Games like Apex, or Warzone, or even Fortnite.

These changes are Io Interactive's solution to the currently messy process of buying Hitman games or working out what you already own. From January 26th, when these changes take effect, there will be just two Hitman packages for sale. This might mean that you're getting some existing content for free, and it will mean that future DLC purchases should cost less.

      <p>Fall Guys is becoming&nbsp;<em>Invincible</em> with the arrival of skins from the acclaimed&nbsp;animated series this week.</p>

<p>With season 2 of <em>Invincible</em> set to premiere on Amazon Prime sometime this year, Fall Guys is whetting fans’ appetite with skins for Mark, Omni-Man, and Atom Eve. The outfits hit the in-game store on January 5, and that hopefully means a release date announcement for the series won't be too far behind.&nbsp;</p>


<blockquote class="tw-align-center twitter-tweet">

<p>Fall Guys enjoyed a bit of a renaissance in&nbsp;2022. In addition to its usual deluge of seasonal content updates, it went <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/05/16/fall-guys-is-going-free-to-play-launching-on-xbox-and-switch-next-month">free-to-play</a> in May and launched on Xbox and Switch, gaining a larger player base of contestants and renewed interest in general. We look forward to seeing what 2023 brings for the title, but this is a pretty good start.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>Developer Starbreeze Studios and publisher Koch Media have released a new teaser trailer that calls 2023 "the year of PayDay 3." Presumably, this means the co-op shooter is still on track to release sometime this year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Koch gave PayDay 3 <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2021/03/19/payday-3-release-set-for-2023-with-new-publishing-deal-18-month-post-launch-support" target="_blank">a 2023 release window way back in March of 2021</a>, detailing the game's new publishing deal alongside news that there is at least 18 months of post-launch support planned for the title. Later that year, in June, Koch released a new piece of concept art, citing that <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/e3-2021/2021/06/10/koch-media-shows-off-gungrave-gore-painkiller-and-slate-of-new-ips" target="_blank">PayDay 3 will feature a "fully-fledged social heist universe" set within a Hollywood-like setting</a>. That was the last we saw of PayDay 3 until yesterday, when <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/payday-3-official-reveal-trailer" target="_blank"><em>IGN</em></a> revealed the "official reveal trailer" for the game, although considering how little is shown in it, it's less of a reveal and more of a teaser.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Check out this new PayDay 3 trailer below</strong>:&nbsp;</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" frameBorder="0"  allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/q1VvQ9-50Fg" width=""></iframe>

<p>As you can see, there's not much to this trailer other than it calling 2023 "the year of PayDay 3." Here's hoping that holds true.&nbsp;</p>

However, it wouldn't be a surprise if the U.S. Government's recent domain name seizures played a key role in this decision.

      <p>I made 12 little games (analog and digital) over the course of my MFA program. However, I dedicated most of that time to my thesis. By graduation, I’d worked as a writer/narrative designer on prototypes, vertical slices, documentation – you name it. And after many adjustments, my thesis even won a highly competitive grant to assist post-grad development! Short deadlines and secondary assignments led to high-stress periods, albeit in a controlled, academic environment, but the lessons about collaboration and creativity were invaluable.</p>

<p>It’s an ordinary school night, and I’m in a video call with my friend Jude. I watch them casually scroll through graffiti-adjacent concept art and brief clips of a passion project called Ponch: Cyberspace Investigator. They give me a rundown of the game’s mechanics, inspirations, and vibe, which includes phrases like “platformer,” “Ace Attorney-inspired dialogue puzzles,” “detective work,” and “hack the internet.” <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/feature/2022/12/01/what-i-learned-designing-my-thesis-game">Read more...</a></p>]]></summary>

      <p>2023 means a new year, new everything! That includes a renewed hope that I’ll hear more information about a few exciting games that had little to no presence in 2022. Hopefully, with 365 chances to make a splash, one of the following titles from my personal wish list will make a big comeback after spending a year in relative silence. </p>

      <p class="firstgraph">In October 2001, Rockstar Games released Grand Theft Auto III – and the entire pop-culture paradigm shifted. It’s hard to say anything about GTA III that hasn’t been said a million times over the last 20 years, but suffice it to say, it laid a blueprint for open-world games so complete that the game industry still largely follows it today.</p>

<p>To celebrate the game’s 20th anniversary, we recently talked to Rockstar North art director Aaron Garbut over email about his time working on GTA III, what it meant for Rockstar as a company, and its overall legacy in 2021.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/feature/2022/12/19/20-years-of-liberty-city">Read more...</a></p>]]></summary>

      <p>You could walk past this section of sidewalk a million times and not think about it once. It’s a 15-foot patch of concrete the same as the 15 feet ahead of you and the 15 feet behind you. No different than the 100 feet beyond that. It’s nothing.</p>

<p>Until you look around, then, all of a sudden, you can see through time.</p>

<p>I’m standing in the Shibuya ward of Tokyo, Japan, which, if it’s famous for anything, is its crosswalk, Shibuya Crossing, a massive scramble intersection allowing foot traffic to cross in all directions. For lack of a better analogy, you could call it Japan’s Times Square. You’ve seen it in everything about modern Japan ever.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/feature/2022/12/16/back-alleys-and-side-streets">Read more...</a></p>]]></summary>

      <p>Game delays are a part of life. You know the old saying, a delayed game is…well, you know. It’s undeniably a bummer to see a title you’re excited about slip into the following year, but it’s generally for the best to ensure a quality product at release. 2022 has had a growing handful of high-profile setbacks, and we’ve assembled them all in one alphabetized list for a handy reference.</p>

      <p>On February 25, 2022 Valve quietly premiered a trailer for a game called Aperture Desk Job. The video intentionally didn’t explain what the game was, but beyond including the word Aperture in the title, it was clear it took place in the Portal universe. The end of the trailer revealed it would be releasing only a few days later, and it would be free.</p>

      <p>Each mainline entry of the Street Fighter series is an important milestone in the fighting game genre. Though every numbered entry received critical acclaim, Street Fighter V sticks out among fans as the outlier of the series; the game experienced perhaps the most tumultuous launch of any Street Fighter game to date. But out of that trouble emerged something great. Thanks to the team’s persistence, post-launch roadmap, and an injection of new blood into the project's leadership, Street Fighter V drastically improved its core gameplay, online play, content offerings, and more throughout its six-year lifespan.</p>

<p>With the benefit of those lessons learned, many team members that righted the ship are back to develop Street Fighter 6. The latest entry delivers myriad improvements, new features, and a sleek new aesthetic while simultaneously acknowledging and paying homage to each entry before it. Street Fighter 6 feels like yet another evolution of the fighting game genre ushered in by the franchise that pioneered it in the first place.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/feature/2022/12/16/the-dawn-of-a-new-era">Read more...</a></p>]]></summary>

After more than 150 hours roaming the Lands Between, I feel the familiar bittersweetness that occurs anytime I finish a game I love. I’d conquered unimaginable horrors and become Elden Lord in my own personalized adventure, all while cruising atop a cool double-jumping steed; now what? Recovering from this high would become a personal struggle for the remainder of the year.</p>

      <p>Mortal Kombat was not supposed to die. Many regard Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe as one of the lowest points of the series. Its minigame-centric fights and awkward movement were damning, but it also lacked the silly, over-the-top violence Mortal Kombat is known for – a sad reality for appeasing license holder Warner Bros. Batman can cripple impoverished criminals, but he can’t be cut in half by Tarkatan blades.</p>

<p>It would have been disappointing to end on an ill-fated crossover, but Midway’s untimely demise could have made that so. Layoffs, uncertainty, and publisher implosion aren’t how franchises live; it’s how they die. But the then-newly formed NetherRealm Studios reinvigorated the entire franchise after its darkest period with one of its most beloved entries: the 2011 reboot, Mortal Kombat 9.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/feature/2022/12/16/new-blood">Read more...</a></p>

      <p>I am, admittedly, new to the world of Final Fantasy VII. I have vague memories of seeing a TV commercial for the original PlayStation game when I was young and remember playing the game’s first few hours in a friend’s attic between Mat Hoffman’s Pro BMX sessions. It wasn’t until much later, when I found an inexpensive green label copy at a Circuit City, that I gave it another shot, but, again, I only made it through the first few hours. When Square Enix released it in such a way that I could play it on my PlayStation 3 and move it over to my PSP, I made it the furthest. I…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Driller aka Space Station Oblivion (in the US), the FIRST supported game of the Freescape engine, is ready for public testing!
Published in 1987 by Incentive Software Limited, this revolutionary new engine allowed players to explore a solid 3D graphic environment with complete freedom of movement for the very first time in videogame history. 
A new threat emerges after humanity abandoned a dying Earth to establish a new home on planet Evath. Evath's moon Mitral has turned into a gigantic gas time bomb. A meteor is also due to impact Mitral in the next several hours. You were chosen to secure each of Mitral's 18 sectors by positioning a drilling rig over the gas pockets in each sector before the meteor strikes.
Solve challenging riddles by relying on geological clues, intuition, or good old trial and error. To survive your mission, find Rubicon crystals to restore energy and destroy (or avoid) the Laser Beacons and Skanners left behind by the Ketars. Good luck!
Our reimplemented engine features graphics using software (TinyGL) or hardware mode (OpenGL) at arbitrary resolution. The initial Driller support is limited to DOS (EGA mode), Amiga and AtariST releases, but we hope to be able to add more soon! Please contact us if you have some other release.
To play any of these supported releases, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker.
