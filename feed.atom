        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales is making its way to Steam next month. On November 18, you can swing through Harlem as Miles from the comfort of your PC desktop.
Set one year after the events of Marvel’s Spider-Man, the story follows Miles as he battles the Roxxon corporation. A new trailer shows off the game’s PC features, which are comparable to the first Spider-Man game. Improvements include ray-traced reflections/shadows, unlocked framerate, ultra-widescreen support, Nvidia DLSS 3/DLAA support, Nvidia Reflex, and DualSense controller support. Check it out below.


Here are the PC specifications as well (click the image to enlarge). 
We scored Miles Morales a 9 out of 10 when it was released in November 2020. Former editor Andrew Reiner wrote in his review that: 
"For a second act, Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales satisfies. Taking to the web-line and soaring across a wintery New York skyline is every bit as enthralling as it was before, and Miles develops into a fantastic hero. This follow-up doesn’t have as much of a sinister punch, but it delivers some great plot twists and concludes with another eye-opening post-credits sequence that teases an exciting future for Insomniac’s Spider-Man series."]]></summary>

Another Marvel's Spider-Man has locked in a date for a PC port. Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales hits PC on November 18.
The PC version of Miles Morales will have PC features and settings, similar to the Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered port that hit PC earlier this year.
These include some fancy graphics options, like ray-traced reflections and new ray-traced shadows. NVIDIA DLSS 3 is also being supported, as are other options like DLSS 2, DLAA, and NVIDIA Reflex. And hardware-wise, Miles Morales will support ultra-wide gaming with ratios of 21:9, 32:9, or even 48:9 through triple-monitor setups.
That's on the extreme end of things though. According to today's PlayStation Blog, Insomniac is also supporting other configurations aside from high-end PCs; namely, portable PC gaming devices. DualSense haptics will also be supported, if you wire one in over a USB connection.

A shocking spin of the web
If you don't own Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered, then no worries. This is a standalone entry. It's going for $49.99 on Steam and Epic, and pre-orders will net a few in-game goodies a little earlier than you'd normally achieve them.
Miles' Spidey adventure is one I never got around to finishing on PlayStation 5, so the prospect of revisiting it is pretty appealing. It's received some high praise, and I like the idea of a short, cinematic Spider-Man game to zip through.
Nice to hear that portable PC devices are a consideration too, for those who have been picking up a Steam Deck now that they're extremely available. The Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered PC port wound up being pretty good, and I'd hope the same holds true for Miles Morales' hop over to computers.
Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales arrives on PC on November 18, 2022.

There are a lot of things we’re beginning to associate with Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope; surprise, joy, freedom. But perhaps the most important one is ‘change’.
Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle was a huge success for creative director Davide Soliani's team at Ubisoft, with the game reaching 10 million players worldwide as of 2022. And, given those numbers, Ubisoft Milan and Ubisoft Paris could've just rested on their laurels and created a solid follow-up to their first game. Instead, they are looking to the stars for a fresh shot of joy.

Matthew comes through with an excellent Cavern Of Lies about trees and tree monsters in games, where he attempts to pull the illusive Double Beckford on us. Does he succeed? Listen to find out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[DiabNo
Publisher Line Games Corporation and developer Needs Games have announced that their hack 'n' slash adventure Undecember has now launched worldwide — The free-to-play monster masher is available to download on PC (via Steam) and mobile platforms iOS and Android in all territories.
Set in the high-fantasy realm of Traum — a benevolent land created by the arrival of 12 divine beings — Undecember sees the calm and tranquility of this world shattered by the arrival of the 13th being, Evil God Serpens. With the land now infested with ravaging hordes of demons, ogres, and other unholy hellspawn, it is up to a party of hardy adventurers to take up steel, axe, and bow, defeat the marauders, and offer Serpens a one-way ticket to oblivion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paXcwjTGDxY&t
As you can see from the trailer above, Undecember is a violent, action-packed dungeon crawler not dissimilar to Blizzard Entertainment's iconic series, Diablo. Offering up a 10-act story campaign, a selection of endgame challenges, Boss Raids, and a rock-solid "Chaos Dungeon", Undecember hopes to carve a niche out for itself, boasting some pretty attractive features including custom class building, a deep, rune-based skill system, cross-platform support, and co-op modes for up to eight players.
Dungeon-crawling fans waiting on the far-off release of Diablo 4, or mobile players who perhaps were not feeling Diablo Immortal, may do well to look at this contender and see if it ignites that fantasy fyre.
Undecember is now available to download on PC and mobile platforms. Any and all players who login during launch week will be able to take part in a special introductory event — offering up some exclusive gear, runes, and other in-game bonus items.

The weekly Japanese charts from Famitsu have landed, and Splatoon 3 is still taking everyone to the cleaners. it's another week where the multiplayer shooter has sold over 100k copies, which means the game has now sold 3 million copies — that doesn't include physical sales, however. Geez.
However, NieR:Automata's Switch port has sold a decent amount, making it the highest-charting new release. The action RPG from Square Enix and PlatinumGames, released on the PS4 back in 2017 initially, has sold 30,218 in the week of 3rd to 9th October.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Detective games are often about filling in the blanks. A terrible crime will sit at the heart of them, yes, but most take place in the days and weeks that follow, where the bulk of your time is spent gathering clues and building a case to work out whodunnit. Rarely do you get to glimpse the immediate aftermath of the crime itself, where all the major suspects are still in play and their pockets are stuffed with incriminating evidence they'll no doubt be disposing of in the coming minutes. 
The prime exception to this rule is Lucas Pope's Return Of The Obra Dinn, which gives you a time-travelling pocket watch to revisit the scenes of its many, many murders and work out exactly what happened to its 60-strong passenger list on its titular, ill-fated ship. Frogwares' Sherlock Holmes games and their mind palace visualisation techniques also warrant a mention here, and maybe even Outer Wilds at a push, if you count its 22-minute timeloop as an investigation scene several millennia in the making. But it's Obra Dinn that Color Gray Games emulate most strongly with their impressive debut in The Case Of The Golden Idol, which gives you a series of 12 murders to solve, each of which is presented as a freeze-frame vignette at the moment of death. You're still filling in blanks here, slotting names, objects and eventually verbs in its various scene scrolls to deduce whodunnit and howtheydunit, but this intriguing tale of 18th century high (and a secret) society, betrayals, backstabbing and murder most foul is a mystery game for the ages.

Following on from former playtester Mackenzie Clifton's recent account of their dismissal, recruitment firm Aston Carter has agreed to pay the fired Nintendo contractor a settlement of $25,910.00. Senior reporter at Kotaku Ethan Gach shared the update on Twitter earlier today.
Clifton filed a complaint against the recruitment agency and Nintendo of America back in April, accusing the companies of union-busting tactics. The settlement agreement, which is public viewable and available to download here, specifies the damages fee from Aston Carter and also stipulates that Nintendo of America will have to post notice in its offices and email a copy of the notice in English to employees.

Nintendo has revealed a brand new trailer for Bayonetta 3 called 'The Witching Hour' and it's one that folks might want to hold off on viewing if you're keen to avoid any spoilers.
The footage goes heavy on narrative details from the start, but also features some killer gameplay that we can't wait to try out when the game launches on October 28th. Primarily, we get a glimpse of some new 2D gameplay in which you infiltrate a laboratory and utilise stealth abilities to take out the enemies. It's certainly a significant step away from the franchise's iconic hack 'n' slash mechanics!

This review originally went live in 2013, and we're updating and republishing it to mark the game's arrival in Switch's N64 library via the Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pack.

Releasing alongside Super Mario 64 when the Nintendo 64 launched back in 1996 (1997 if you're European), it was somewhat inevitable that Pilotwings 64 was never going to see the same commercial or critical success. Simply put, Mario's first 64-bit adventure was a masterpiece and proved that Nintendo could recreate its flagship franchise for the next generation of gaming. While the portly plumber delivered a much-needed killer app to Nintendo's advanced system, its amateur flight simulator counterpart was considered little more than a glorified tech demo by many observers at the time.

FromSoftware has released a new update for its 2022 super-seller, Elden Ring — Version 107, now available on all platforms, focuses on bug fixes across the board, and includes a fresh set of balance tweaks for the challenging adventure title's PvP Mode.
Those who enjoy battling other adventurers traversing The Lands Between should be aware that the new update increases Stamina Attack Power for all attacks on guarded opponents, save for when long-range weapons are at play. Several incantations have also had a power nerf, including Dragonfire, Agheel's Flame, Glintstone Breath, Smarag's Glintstone Breath, Rotten Breath, Ekzykes's Decay, Dragonice, Borealis's Mist, and Unendurable Frenzy. Finally, Ashes of War has had a power nerf across the board.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOrtKh8Vv3g
Damage scaling has now been enabled on a separate plane for all weapons, skills, spells, and incantations used in PvP play. None of the applied changes will affect Elden Ring's single-player campaign nor its cooperative mode. All changes are restricted player for player vs player encounters. Smaller tweaks have been applied to Poise, weapon attack speeds, and a variety of spells. For a full list of patch notes, you can visit the official Elden Ring blog.
In somewhat more unofficial news, (as reported by VGC), Elden Ring modder Lance McDonald has already dug into the code featured in the new update, and postulates that the update contains references to maps and areas that are yet to appear in the FromSoft adventure, suggesting the possibility that a DLC expansion could be en route. Such a release would come as no surprise, given the incredible success of Elden Ring from a critical and sales standpoint. Of course, the data could merely reference previously tossed locations that were deleted before development was completed.
Elden Ring is available now on PlayStation and PC platforms.

That’s why the game’s Steam version will have its own tutorial. Co-creator Zach Adams has roped in a novice playtester to try the tutorial out, in the form of his wife Annie. Annie bounced off the original, not-so-visually-appealing version of Dwarf Fortress. Yet, says Adams, the tutorial seems to be working to help Annie ease into the game at last.

We have known for a while now that Sonic's upcoming 'open world' adventure, Sonic Frontiers, was going to make some notable changes to the hedgehog's combat system - there's only so far that boosts, jumps and spins will get you against skyscraper-sized Guardians. Fortunately, the latest trailer (here re-uploaded by ShayRSynergy after Sega took down their initial release) showcases Sonic's new fighting moves in action, and it looks to be a lot more boosts, jumps and spins, only more complicated.
To be clear, this is not the first time that we have seen Sonic testing out these fists as previous trailers have shown him taking on enemies too, but this is the first detailed look at his new powers - and boy, is it detailed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A simplified quest for world domination.
We all have big dreams of world domination, but not everyone wants the full Civilization experience. Sometimes, we just want to take over the planet without having to try too hard! For those times, there is The Battle of Polytopia, a scaled-back version of the usual 4X gameplay that we’ve all grown to know and love.
After a brief tutorial, The Battle of Polytopia sets players loose to try to take over a map filled with potential enemies. Players take control of one of several civilizations to try to expand their empire to all corners of an increasingly crowded map. You can play against the AI or other players, though online multiplayer wasn’t available for us to test ahead of the game’s full launch.

Breaking Bad is one of those shows that's so good, it remains relevant almost a decade after it goes off the air. As its legacy lives on, I have to wonder if it'll ever get a true video game adaptation, maybe as a GTA-style open world, or a Telltale-style narrative adventure. There's a lot of potential there, but for now, we can continue to imagine the possibilities to tide us over. That's exactly what this fan did when they envisioned what Breaking Bad might look like if it were made to be a game for the PS1.
The video was created by YouTube user PotBoiler, and features over a minute of "gameplay" from the hypothetical PS1 title. The "game" opens with Walter White's classic pre-cancer chemistry lecture from the pilot. The player then takes control of Jesse, who is tasked with killing Gale before a timer runs out. As he drives through the streets, he hits another car, which gets the cops on his tail. No need to worry, though, because Jesse can just stop by Saul's place to get rid of the fuzz. Unfortunately he fails the mission, so I guess Heisenberg is dead in this alternate timeline.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfCcLyJonxA
I wish we had more info about how PotBoiler actually made this mockup, but they did disclose in the description of the YouTube video that it was specifically inspired by GTA, so it seems we agree on what type of game would be best suited for a Breaking Bad adaptation (something the show's creator wanted as well). As per usual, I am constantly impressed by the type of fan art fans can come up with, and while this particular version looks (purposefully) janky as hell, I'd love to play a more modern version.
Check out some other PS1 "demakes," including Horizon Zero Dawn and Bloodborne.

This post-apocalyptic action film starring Kevin Costner cost a lot of money to make and was an infamous dud. So naturally, The Simpsons made a joke about it. And now that joke has become a…

Overwatch 2 has been seeing some launch troubles. While Blizzard is investigating and working on them as they pop up, the company is also rolling out some rewards like double XP to make up for lost time.
The new version of Blizzard's team hero shooter has run into a few stumbling blocks. Players reported account and unlock issues, there was criticism of the new SMS Protect authentication, and the servers faced a few rounds of DDoS attacks. It led to frustration, and players hitting long queues trying to get in.
According to a new blog post, Blizzard is continuing to roll out more stability updates, and is continuing to monitor the game. Known issues are being tracked in a thread on Blizzard's site here.
To "make up for lost time" though, there will be several Double Match XP weekends on the way. Blizzard isn't announcing when just yet.
Players who log in between October 25 and the end of Season One will also get two cosmetic freebies: the Cursed Captain Legendary skin for Reaper and a Health Pack Weapon Charm. These items will be added to collections as soon as a player logs in during that window.

New age of heroes
It's safe to say that the launch of Overwatch 2 has been a bit rocky. Aside from the launch woes, the delivery system for new heroes via the Battle Pass and other aspects of the free-to-play monetization put a sour note on our early access review.
The about-face on some aspects, like foregoing SMS authentication for "a majority" of old Overwatch owners, at least helps. But the new Overwatch, which has replaced the old Overwatch, still feels like it's getting its wheels down under it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Subscription service the cornerstone of Xbox brand
According to new statistics published by Brazil's Administrative Council for Economic Defence (CADE), celebrated subscription service Xbox Game Pass raked in a staggering $2.9 billion USD in revenue over the course of 2021. The figure was published in a CADE report on the Microsoft/Blizzard acquisition.
The figure, shared by TweakTown and reported by GamesIndustry.biz, offers up one of the first dollar amounts for the increasingly popular service, which offers its subscribers access to a huge library of new and classic games on both the Xbox and PC platforms. No further information about the eye-watering figure was released, with the figure focusing solely on Xbox subscribers, eschewing PC players.
Assuming that the listed figure is accurate, Xbox Game Pass makes up something in the region of 18% of all Microsoft's Xbox revenue for 2021 — a year that generated a total revenue of just over $16 billion. The Xbox Game Pass service has continued to grow in both its userbase and its global reputation since its initial launch in the summer of 2017, and currently boasts a huge 25 million subscribers.
Earlier this year, Sony Interactive Entertainment launched its own Game Pass competitor in the form of the revamped PlayStation Plus service, which utilizes a tier-based system to offer games from all eras of the PlayStation platform to its subscribers. Subscription gaming is fast proving itself both rewarding for the players themselves, and very profitable for the publishers, leading one to wonder whether future generations of console gaming will explore the possibilities of gaming subscriptions as a core concept.

But I might enjoy this one week of exploring a gorgeous desert, climbing and gliding and hoverbiking, and you might too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Switch version was updated to 1.1.0
No More Heroes 3 Japanese audio is in, thanks to a new patch that also coincides with the launch of the game on PC, PS4/PS5, and Xbox One/Xbox Series X.
The Switch patch isn't massive, but brings the game up to version 1.1.0, and adds a new Japanese voice option to the game. It's enough to get me to play it again for sure!
As for the rest of the versions, the PS4, PS5, and Xbox editions were all touched in some way. The PS4 port had the least to fix (minor bugs), while the PS5 version has a small handful of fixes (including jump and dodge button flipping). That same swath of fixes applies to both the Xbox One and Xbox Series X ports.
So if you're having issues, update your game! It usually goes without saying, but just in case you assumed you could play it day one while offline. You can find the full patch rundown below!

◇Additional specifications
・New implementation of Japanese voice
PS5 Version Ver.1.002 Update Details

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Paldea region's Poke-influencer is revealed
Today's Pokemon Scarlet and Violet trailer has premiered, showcasing the debut of a new Gym Leader. Iono is an Electric-type Gym Leader in Pokemon Scarlet and Violet, which launches for Nintendo Switch on November 18.
The new video centered on Iono and her livestream antics. The Gym Leader is also a streamer and influencer on the side. As an Electric-type Leader too, her Magnemite hair clips are a pretty cool accessory.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9HAaHc3wnc
The video caps off with a "guess that Pokemon" segment. Iono does a 20 Questions-style game where her viewers ask questions about her partner Pokemon, trying to deduce which one it might be.
Hints include the Pokemon being squishy, not being Magnemite, and being sluggish with an easy-going vibe. It has two "big ol' bumps on its noggin" that people mistake for eyes, and it is an Electric-type Pokemon. Its body also expands to generate electricity, and it's cute.
Honestly, I have no clue. My bet would be that this is a tease for a future Paldean-region Pokemon reveal for Scarlet and Violet. Wiglett and Grafaiai were also teased before being fully revealed.
Paths to Pokemon victory
At least we now have another Gym Leader to add to the list. We've already seen Ice-type Leader Grusha and Grass-type Leader Brassius.
These three, alongside the other heads of different Gyms, will make up one of Pokemon Scarlet and Violet's storylines. But there are two other ones as well.
On the Path of Legends, for example, you'll go off in search of rare special ingredients. And in another, you take on this generation's antagonistic crew Team Star. From a recent trailer, it seems like that will also be an area where the auto-battle mechanic will come in handy.
It won't be long until we have to face off against Iono and the other Gym Leaders either, as Pokemon Scarlet and Violet go live on November 18.

Speaking to VGC (alongside of Platinum vice president and CBO Takao Yamane and CEO Atsushi Inaba), vice president Kamiya chimed in on several industry topics (as he does!) and touched on a theoretical follow-up to the Nintendo Switch: as well as how he currently engages with his current hardware, and the hobby in general.

In fact, for September 2021, Splatoon 3 sold 2.7 million physical copies in the territory, which accounts for an incredible 69% of all of Japan's gaming retail for the month in question. Previously, Nintendo had already celebrated Splatoon 3 shifting 3.45 million copies in a mere three days, making it Japan's fastest-selling Nintendo Switch release ever.

The details of the interview have leaked ahead of the publication of issue #1767 of Weekly Famitsu, and in the snippet, Yamamoto highlights that a few things have been optimised, such as "the number of the pieces of debris that blow away for each model. Elements like effects, number of projectiles, etc.", for the remaster.

The developers at Max Inferno Studios read this article and decided that, you know what? Alice0 was on to something. They contacted us to let us know that her piece was the inspiration for adding a feature called Let It Be, a skip puzzle function that you can access at any time. Anne Macmillan, who's a co-founder of Max Inferno Studios as well as artist and animator for A Little To The Left, was kind enough to talk to me about it.

Now that the stellar anime series Edgerunners has seemingly made everyone forget the disaster that was the Cyberpunk 2077 launch, the merchandising machine can move back into full gear — Presented for your consideration: An original novel set within CDPR's hi-tech universe, which will release in 2023.
The novel "No Coincidence" is not a direct adaptation of its source material's narrative, but will instead be a standalone story from the avenues and alleyways of Night City. Penned by Polish author Rafał Kosik, the book will no doubt contain the sleazy customers, upmarket locales, and dangerous dealings of the gorgeous-looking, but ultimately extremely dangerous 'berg.
The Cyberpunk 2077 team has also confirmed that No Coincidence is a full novel, not a comic book.
https://twitter.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1580105868347342849?s=20&t=jVbwkNBh3FNBa4_tiA4ETw
No doubt the literary adventures of Cyberpunk 2077's metal mickeys and minnies will help plug the gap while players wait for DLC expansion Phantom Liberty, which is also currently scheduled for launch at some point in 2023. Earlier this month, CD Projekt RED confirmed that Cyberpunk 2077 will be receiving a sequel at some point in the far-flung future. So while it might have had something of a rough start, it seems that CDPR is hoping to get its slippery new franchise back on stable rails.
Cyberpunk 2077 is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, yes, it’s me, once again banging on about the WD Blue SN570. I just think it’s neat: a highly affordable yet remarkably quick M.2 SSD, with multiple capacities to choose from and regular sales making it even cheaper. Speaking of, today is the last day of the Amazon Prime Early Access Sale, which has the 1TB Blue SN570 down to £65.
That’s not quite its lowest price ever, but it does match its flash sale pricing during Prime Day back in July. And is an utter pittance for a 1TB NVMe SSD, let alone one that’s actually quite speedy. Amazon UK also have the 2TB version on sale for £128, just £1 more than its lowest dip on record (Prime Day 2022 again, as it happens). These prices are only available to Prime members, but the Blue SN570 ranks highly among the best SSDs for gaming, so they're well deserving of your cash if you’re in need of PC storage improvements.

Each and every week the game pile grows higher, forming the walls of a virtually impenetrable digital structure known only as the ‘backlog’. As the games multiply, thickening the increasingly cell-like walls of our den of entertainment, we can only gaze on and hope it doesn’t one day become our tomb. On that light note, it’s nice to see that SteamDB now has a section showing what games are coming out on Steam every week.

Warner Bros Games' fun platform scrapper MultiVersus has received a fresh update, bringing with it a selection of gameplay tweaks, some spooky-ooky Halloween content, and a brand new character in the form of the vicious and malevolent gremlin, Stripe.
Version 1.04, now available on PC and console platforms, sees Stripe join the star-studded roster as one of Season 1's additional characters. Wielding a chainsaw and crossbow, the Assassin class fighter will utilize speed and power in lieu of health and defensive abilities. The little bastard is a pretty frightening opponent, and Gizmo better ensure that he's stocked up on flaming Tippex to take this punk down.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Try and make the answers more than "maybe".
There is a moment in a young person's life — a brief window, around 13 years of age — when their internal maelstrom of hormones, peer pressure, and insecurity reaches its peak, turning the teen into soft, malleable putty, ready to be coaxed into a fandom by the next influential moment that comes along. These fandoms range from books (Harry Potter) to movies (Pirates of the Caribbean) to real-life people (any attractive actor, really) — but it's music that defines that adolescent era unlike any other medium.
For me, it was emo music, which thankfully/horrifyingly is back in vogue right now, but it can be just about anything. The boy you like is into Irish folk? Alright, now you're into Irish folk, with an encyclopaedic knowledge of shillelaghs that you're hoping will impress him. Somehow. Your boyfriend has two tickets to see Iron Maiden, baby? Fantastic. Time to learn what the past twenty years has in store for you, metal-wise. For modern teens, TikTok is a culture-shaper, as the songs that people choose to accompany their short videos can become chart-toppers through sheer exposure (and catchiness).

Then Love Island stepped up to fill a large portion of my summer with curated chaos. One guy confessed "I licked her tit or whatever," in a shock revelation to his betrothed.
What's on the reality TV menu for winter? Ainori Love Wagon: Asian Journey, baby. It's on Netflix and I'm convinced it shares great parallels with some of my favourite RPGs of all time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Final Fantasy VII The First Soldier, the mobile multiplayer battle royale, is being shut down in January. The news comes a month shy of the game's one-year anniversary, having launched for iOS and Android in November 2021. 
Square Enix states that it feels it hasn’t delivered the experience it aimed for, so it will begin winding down service starting today. A roadmap on the game’s website lists a three-step sunsetting schedule. Today, you can no longer purchase Shinra credits from the shop, but you can still spend the credits you own until the game shuts down. On November 1, support for non-English localization ends (meaning text will only be displayed in English going forward). Finally, on January 11, The First Soldier goes offline for good.
Here's the full End of Service announcement via Twitter:
The First Soldier was revealed in February 2021 alongside another mobile FFVII RPG, Ever Crisis (which has yet to release but has a closed beta planned for this year). The third-person battle royale took place before the events of FFVII and pit 75 players against each other as SOLDIER candidates. In addition to using firearms, players wield magic and even summons. Square previously stated The First Soldier was an attempt to attract a wider fanbase to the FFVII universe while giving existing fans a new way to enjoy its mythos. 
Unfortunately, this isn't the first Square Enix published multiplayer game to get the axe this year. Babylon's Fall, Platinum Games' live-service action RPG, is also being shutdown in February, less than a year after its ill-received launch. 
While The First Soldier is going away, plenty of FFVII content is in the pipeline. As previously mentioned, Ever Crisis remains on the docket, and Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII Reunion releases on December 13. Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, the follow-up to Remake, is scheduled to launch next winter.]]></summary>

Ever wanted a living Cuphead for your very own? Well, merchandiser iam8bit has the next best thing, opening pre-orders on a special Collector's Edition of Studio MDHR's excellent 2017 platformer.
The Cuphead Collector's Edition offers up a boxed physical copy of Cuphead — complete with its Delicious Last Course DLC — on PS4, Xbox One, or Nintendo Switch, alongside several suitably old-school goodies. These include a membership card for The Cuphead Club; six art cards or newspaper-style "funnies"; a sweet, hand-cranked music box; a map of the Inkwell Islands, and an exclusive outer sleeve for your game case, all of which are in keeping with Cuphead's classic cartoon style.
The centerpiece of the collector's edition, however, is an utterly delightful marionette of old crockery skull himself. Standing eight inches in height and sporting a weathered design, the super cute puppet will allow Cuphead fans to entertain/frighten their friends and family members with fun little performances... Or just hang him on the back of your bedroom door. Whatever works for you.

As a fun additional touch, the collector's edition box doubles as a stage, complete with an "asbestos curtain", so you have a charming little ramshackle display case for your new string-based pal. The marionette was designed by legendary Prague studio Rici Marionettes, with the team's loving attention to detail reflected in the model's authentic look and turn-of-the-century build.
It's good day for a great pre-order, and if you want in, then you can bag the Cuphead Collector's Edition over on the iam8bit website right now, priced at $199.99 USD. The box set is expected to ship in the first quarter of 2023. For those of you who are simply looking for the game itself, then standard boxed editions of Cuphead will launch on PS4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch on December 6.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Pokémon Company and Nintendo have released a new Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet trailer all about Iono, the electric-type gym leader of Levincia and the most popular streamer in the Paldean region. 
If you're expecting a look at Pokémon Scarlet and Violet gameplay or the reveal of some new Pokémon or gameplay mechanics, temper your expectations because this video is all about Iono. Check out the gym leader Iono trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, there's a lot going on in this new video. Iono is very much a Paldean influencer, which is a fun addition to the universe of Pokémon, but she's also a gym leader that we'll be facing off against in the game. As for her type, it's Electric, and while not confirmed, it seems the video is hinting toward a gym challenge for her. Before actually battling her, we might have to successfully complete her "who's that Pokémon?" test.
In this instance, she describes her very own Pokémon pal, but we don't get the answer. Perhaps we're meant to know what it is based on her description or maybe she's describing a Pokémon we haven't yet met. Only time will tell. Fortunately, we don't have to wait too much longer to meet this "Supercharged Streamer" because Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet hit Switch on November 18. 
In the meantime, check out this 14-minute Pokémon Scarlet and Violet gameplay trailer from last week, and then watch this video all about Wiglett, a new Diglett-like Pokémon. Check out this trailer all about competitive play after that, and then read our Pokémon Scarlet and Violet preview for more details about Paldea, Terastallizing, and more. 
Do you have an idea of which Pokémon Iono is describing in today's trailer? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Witchfire has been one of the most promising-looking shooters since its reveal in 2017. The dark fantasy romp was slated to launch in early access later this year, but a shift in design has forced developer The Astronauts to push that launch into next year.
The Astronauts has decided to rework Witchfire’s arena-style combat into an open-world format. Creative director Adrian Chmielarz writes in a blog post that the change makes Witchfire a “better” game. 
“The feature is now 95% implemented. It makes the game better. It is kind of hard for me to imagine the player did not have that freedom before. Sure, you can still be trapped by the witch in this or that spot, and some doors will be closed until you find a key, and it might be too dangerous to enter areas closer to the boss before you are ready– but the world is wide open for you to explore in almost any order, and you can both push forward and retreat as you please.”
Chmielarz also teases more Witchfire news to emerge in the next week or so. It won’t be gameplay footage but rather content promoting the game’s art and world in some fashion. 
Witchfire blends gunplay with the supernatural as players wield guns and magic to fend off otherworldly threats. The game is set in an alternate reality where you’re tasked with hunting down a witch at the behest of the church. The Astronauts previously developed The Vanishing of Ethan Carter, and the studio is made up of ex-People Can Fly employees. 
Witchfire is still slated to launch on PC via The Epic Game Store in early 2023. You can watch the most recent trailer from this year’s Summer Game Fest here.]]></summary>

At the time it was swiftly shot down as an obvious joke, and I was shamed, but now the freeware game based on a ten-second joke in a 1997 episode of The Simpsons is out. So who's laughing now, eh? Play it for yourself via creator Macaw45's itch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ongoing Operations
According to murmurs circulating the information superhighway this week, Activision might be considering eschewing its annual Call of Duty release in 2023, and is instead looking into the potential of instead releasing a DLC expansion for this year's entry, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II.
The speculative news comes from regular Call of Duty leaker TheGhostofHope, who posted the proposal on their Twitter account this past weekend. According to TheGhost, Activision will instead use 2023 to boost the content of 2021's release, adding new campaign missions, and a 20th anniversary "Best of" map pack, featuring revamped multiplayer maps from the billion-dollar shooter's storied history.

While Volition say this means they’re not at the stage where they can be “talking about roadmaps and expansions”, they are at least releasing a free cosmetic pack this week that includes some boots that look like bananas.

Recently, Nintendo held a "Nintendo Live 2022" celebration in Tokyo, Japan, which included concerts for both Splatoon 3 and Animal Crossing: New Horizons. But they also had a few other things on display, like this Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom statue.
Link is donning his newer outfit, complete with a badass shonen cape, a bow, a sword, and a killer arm. The detail on the chain links of his armor and his gloves (and the belt!) are excellent: and the base he's on gives off the aura of "dilapidated stone," which fits the dire/ruin theme of the game we've seen thus far.
Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom (which we know is pronounced like "tears of joy") is due out on May 12, 2023. It feels like it's been a long time coming, and it kind of will be! Zelda: Breath of the Wild was released in March of 2017, so by then, it'll be a whopping six years since it launched alongside of the Switch.
I literally can't believe it! I've talked about this often, but Breath of the Wild is still deeply relevant, and I have to constantly double and triple check to make sure I didn't get the release date wrong.

A virtual reality version of a very popular impostor game hits headsets soon. Among Us VR arrives on November 10 for Steam and Meta Quest.
This version of Among Us is a collaboration between Schell Games, Innersloth, and Robot Teddy. The new version will run for $9.99, and you can find it on the Steam store here or over at the Quest storefront.
As you can tell from the trailers we've seen thus far, this is essentially first-person VR Among Us. Players take on the role of different crewmates, all trying to complete their tasks on the ship. Meanwhile, one or some of them are impostors, and their goal is take out the crew while not getting caught.

A brand-new perspective
Among Us VR will support four to ten players in a match. VR players can only play with other VR players, though. And it looks like the level included so far is called Skeld II, a 3D made-for-virtual-reality version of the Skeld from classic Among Us.
The old mini-games will return, as will some new ones just for VR. And of course, there's the difference in perspective. While 2D Among Us takes an overhead view, Among Us VR goes fully first-person. Seeing someone vent in VR will probably be terrifying.

Alongside the news of Among Us VR's release date, today's Meta Connect showcase also held a few more big reveals. Meta has picked up several gaming studios, including Iron Man VR developer Camouflaj, Twisted Pixel, and Armature Studio, the team behind Resident Evil 4's Meta Quest adaptation.
Meta also unveiled its new virtual reality headset, the Meta Quest Pro. It's a high-end piece of hardware that comes with a hefty price tag. Among Us VR, meanwhile, can run on the Meta Quest 2 or on other headsets via Steam.

I think it's pretty safe to say that Mario is one of the most instantly recognizable and beloved video game characters in history, and I think we chose well to have him represent the medium we hold so dear. There are many facts to what makes Mario so universally adored (which is in no small part thanks to the decades-spanning voice performance of Charles Martinet), but one of them is his chunky little character design, which doesn't look as prominent in his upcoming movie.
Even compared to other human characters on the roster like Princess Peach, Mario's proportions are much more distinct. He's short, he's round, and his little circular torso acts as the point from which the rest of his limbs emanate. It's an iconic look, and considering we've seen it so many times …]]></summary>

The team at Volition is laying out the future of updates for Saints Row. As the reboot passes a significant milestone, the developer is also talking about its plans for fine-tuning the game post-launch.
In a new blog, Volition and publisher Deep Silver confirm the 2022 Saints Row has seen 1 million players boot it up. That's a lot of players, but Saints Row has also been dealing with a number of bugs, too.
The studio says it is prioritizing delivering improvements over new features. Part of that is the major update planned for late November, the first one Saints Row is receiving since its launch in August.
The update will see 'over 200' bug fixes and stability upgrades. There will be a focus on challenges, overall stability.
"We’re especially aware of issues some players have been having with co-op and we’re sorry these fixes have taken longer than expected while we apply and test them thoroughly," said Volition in the update.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgjzDJA1o1E
What's in store the reboot
Quality-of-life improvements are also in store for the autumn update. A few specified changes include reducing repetition in some activities, improving management of vehicles, and making challenges more rewarding.
Though newer content is "less of a priority" for the Saints Row team now, the crew is still planning for the future. Volition and Deep Silver say they plan to support Saints Row for the long-term.
Saints Row is due to receive all-new story content in 2023, included in the Expansion Pass or purchasable as a separate piece. Free ne gameplay experiences and city areas are also in development. Cosmetic DLC is also expected to arrive this week for all Saints Row owners, with more on the way this year. Expansion Pass owners will get a few additional cosmetic packs, too.

Inspired by series like Final Fight, Kung-Fu Master, and Karate Champ, the fighting genre emerged in arcades, buoyed by a few significant players in the space. One of those franchises was Mortal Kombat, a bloody, gory fighting game that took concepts from other fighting games and dialed them to 11. The series became notorious for its spine-ripping, heart-grabbing, limb-chopping action, but beneath the controversies and the hearings was a technically sound, capable fighting game. 
The Mortal Kombat franchise has continued to grow and evolve, showcasing massive staying power in a sometimes ruthless industry. Now, 30 years into the series' existence, Mortal Kombat has proven it's here to stay as one of the preemin…]]></summary>

Nintendo has released a Switch 15.0.0 firmware update, and although it's mostly stability related, like some updates in the past, a few small things have changed.
The most obvious alteration is the following: "Screenshots can be taken using the Capture Button while in the Nintendo Switch Online application found on the Nintendo Switch HOME Menu." In short, this will now allow users to screencap the Switch Online menus: where you can view various My Nintendo challenges, bits of news, special offers, and expansion pack info.
One of the main bonuses of this change is the ability to easily take photos of the cycling array of Switch profile icons, which currently include Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Animal Crossing. At the moment you cannot take screenshots of several other menus in the Nintendo Switch OS, including the eShop.
The other even smaller change involves moving the Bluetooth audio menu (where you can connect various accessories, including headphones). It's not very exciting for a firmware update, right?! Well, that's par for the course.
Switch 15.0.0 firmware patch notes (Released October 10, 2022):
The location of the Bluetooth Audio menu within System Settings has moved.
Screenshots can be taken using the Capture Button while in the Nintendo Switch Online application
General system stability improvements to enhance the user's experience

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Viola, a newcomer to the series and Bayonetta 3’s second playable protagonist, is a figure shrouded in intrigue. This punk rock-inspired warrior hails from another universe and is an Umbra Witch in training. She doesn’t have the same handle on her abilities as Bayonetta (nor her confident elegance), so Viola sports a vastly different playstyle that reflects her inexperience. 


Instead of being adept at using a variety of weapons like Bayonetta, Viola only uses her katana and throwing darts. She also summons her demonic companion Cheshire for backup. What she lacks in finesse, though, she makes up for with raw power.
Playing as Viola, her style feels noticeably more deliberate. She’s still quick, but her sword attacks feel more measured and, most of all, impactful. This approach tells me t…]]></summary>

Atlus' celebrated JRPG Persona 5 Royal is getting set to head to tabletops everywhere, in the form of a brand new card game adaptation that is currently in the works at Pandasauras Games. Designed by veteran designer Emerson Matsuuchi, the new game hopes to capture the surreal adventure and excitement of the 2019 smash hit.
Details are slim-to-none on the rules and setup of the Persona 5 Royal card game but, according to Matsuuchi, games will see players will team up as members of The Phantom Thieves before embarking upon quests to steal hearts, defeat demons, and redeem a rogues' gallery of bad dudes and dudettes. The world and characters of Persona 5 will all be putting in an appearance, from Joker, Lady Ann, and Morgana, to the Palaces, The Metaverse, and the luxurious but unnerving Velvet Room.

The Persona series has always been a fine fit for tabletop adaptation, what with its compendium of monsters and demons, multiple protagonists and antagonists, dungeon-crawling nature, and, of course, its sexy and immediately recognizable visual style. The franchise has seen a number of official and unofficial adaptations already, in the form of the Japanese card game Persona VS, and the very cool Unofficial Persona 5 Phan-Game.
Persona 5 Royal will launch in the fall of 2023. In related news, Atlus announced this weekend that series classics Persona 3 Portable and Persona 4 Golden will finally launch on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms in January 2023. You can read more about these releases right here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I picked up the Romancelvania demo at Steam Next Fest on Alice Bee's recommendation, and she was quite correct when she described it as "extremely relevant to [my] interests". So relevant, in fact, that I'm starting to wonder if this wasn't an attempt at psychological sabotage disguised as a friendly gesture. (You wouldn't do that to me, would you, Alice?)
Romancelvania is exactly what it sounds like: dating sim meets Castlevania. No idea how I missed it during my own perusal of the demo list, because unsurprisingly it's immediately become my favourite thing I've ever played at a Steam Next Fest. I was so drawn in, in fact, that I've been having a tough time putting it down, even when I really need to — hence my suspicion that this was some sort of test on Alice's part. No idea if I've succeeded or failed.
The demo starts on a promising note, awakening you in the persona of a comically brooding and exaggeratedly shirtless hunky Dracula. (The final game will include the option to play as a Lady Drac, if you prefer, who will not be shirtless, but not by a large margin.)

Before we jump on what’s new, the core of Bayonetta 3’s combat remains the same, so veterans will find it easy to slip back into the fun dance of chaining combos, peppering foes with gunfire, unleashing torture attacks, and split-second dodging to trigger the time-slowing Witch Time effect. However, one of Bayonetta’s new tricks is Demon Masquerade. Weapons are now imbued with the power of Bayonetta’s many Infernal Demons.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Coral Island  self-describes as a "reimagining of farming games", but if we're being real it doesn't reimagine the Stardew Valley template totally differently. The titular island, and your overgrown plot of farmland on it, has almost the same layout as Stardew Valley, and the tasks you do - growing stuff, keeping animals, making friends with locals, exploring a mine five levels at a time, and appeasing local spirits by giving them bundles of different crops - will also be very familiar to any DewHeads (that's what we call ourselves).
That's not to say Coral Island isn't good. It's all in very beautiful bouncy 3D, for one thing, and I found the island setting (which impacts the flora, fauna, and architecture in general) made everything feel less like work. Combined with a thread of environmentalism weaving through the game, and the fact that Coral Island is slightly easier than Stardew Valley, and you feel like you're doing more progress in less time. If you loved the vibe of ConcernedApe's smash hit, but found the need to hand-write your own almanac a bit intimidating, this is the game for you.

Game director Kento Kinoshita told Polygon that although playable Lady D is still taller than any other character in Mercenaries, she’s been shortened to “a little under nine feet tall” from her canon height of around nine feet six inches. Kinoshita also went into some detail about Additional Orders’ other characters, including punch-maestro Chris Redfield.

Time to get cooking!@monsterhunter DLC is coming to Sonic Frontiers November 14th, at 5pm PST - for free! pic.twitter.com/4OV4Z4LbPB
October 11, 2022
According to Sega’s Japanese website, the bundle features the Rioreus equipment to outfit Sonic. You’ll also get a grilled meat set, which not only lets you cook up tasty meat but also play mini-games to raise Sonic’s strength. It's a small bundle but a neat way to return the favor after Capcom introduced Sonic-themed content in Monster Hunter Rise last year. Check out Sonic in his armored glory in the photo gallery below.

The Monster Hunter pack will be available to download on November 14, almost a week after Frontiers launches on November 8. For more Sonic Frontiers, check out the latest trailer featuring the reveal of Super Sonic.]]></summary>

In case you missed the mega-guide that went up earlier, today marks the start of Amazon’s Prime Early Access Sale: a two-day buffet of discounts that’s exclusive to Prime members. That includes loads on PC gaming hardware, though my eyes were most immediately caught by something not very desktop-grade at all. The SanDisk Ultra, one of the best microSD cards for the Steam Deck, is on sale across a choice of capacities – with the 1TB model getting especially juicy >50% savings in both the UK and US.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It looks like Crash Bandicoot 4: It’s About Time is heading to Steam, with Activision Blizzard announcing the news in an unorthodox fashion. The publisher also appears to be teasing the reveal of a new Crash game 
The publisher sent a special Crash-themed pizza box (from "Aku Aku's Steam-In Pizza Shack") to influencers, such as YouTuber Candian Guy Eh. His unboxing video shows that the box is taped with a not-so-subtle message that Crash 4 heads to Steam on October 18. The game, which launched in 2020, is currently playable on PC only through Battle.net. 
Additionally, the box was also taped with a message that read, “Hungry for more? Try our new Wumpa Pizza for $12.08!” Given that The Game Awards is set to air on December 8, it appears highly likely we’ll find out the nature of this title (rumored to be a party game called Wumpa League) during the annual show.
Are you excited to play Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time on Steam? What do you think the rumored new game will be? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wild Hearts is Koei Tecmo and EA Original's effort to muscle in on Monster Hunter's monopoly on video games where your primary goal is to make nice pants from gigantic fire geckos. I was lucky enough to go hands-on with an early build of the Wild Hearts's opening hours to see how it stacks up against its age-old competitor, and whether it has any chance of melting down Monster Hunter's trophy cabinet and forging itself a golden crown.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With Persona 5 Royale set to launch on PlayStation 5, Xbox, and Switch on October 21, Atlus has announced the multiplatforms release dates for Persona 3 Portable and Persona 4 Golden. Thankfully, fans only have to wait a few months before all three acclaimed RPG’s become available on modern platforms. 
On January 19, Persona 3 Portable arrives on PlayStation 4, Xbox consoles, Switch, and PC via Steam. That same day, Persona 4 Golden will hit PlayStation 4, Xbox platforms (including Windows), and Switch. Both titles will also be available on Xbox Game Pass at launch.
Persona 3 Portable is the enhanced PSP port of 2007’s Persona 3 (which originally released on PlayStation 2). It launched in 2010 and has never been ported beyond Sony’s handheld. Similarly, Persona 4 Golden is a PS Vita title and the definitive version of its entry, Persona 4. Golden launched in 2012 and has only migrated to Steam, but that didn’t happen until 2020. 
To learn more about each game, check out our reviews for Persona 3 Portable here and Persona 4 Golden here.]]></summary>

Now Overwatch 2 is live, there's a new nine-minute, fully-animated short introducing the hero Kiriko, one of the free-to-play sequel new characters. You can watch it below.

Someone at Valve is evidently aware of this, given the recent Steam Deck video - which we wrote about two days ago - contained a shot of a Steam library with a Nintendo Switch emulator in it.

Oops. Valve have since deleted and re-uploaded the video with the emulator removed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's easy to take backwards compatibility for granted on PC, so much so that we rarely even use the phrase "backwards compatibility". Most old games will simply run, and for everything else there's usually a compatibility mode built into Windows or DOSBox to get it going.

This didn't happen by accident, as an old blog post by a former Microsoft programmer explains. When Microsoft wanted users to switch to Windows 95, for example, they went so far as to add specific code that looked for SimCity and, if it was running, changed how memory allocation worked so that the game wouldn't crash.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Graphics cards are getting bigger, hotter and more expensive - and that first one is more of a problem than you might think. With the RTX 4090 and a whole family of oversized GPUs on the way, those tiny PCIe slots on your motherboard are taking on an incredible amount of weight, such that even mid-range cards can sag and bend over time. 
The best way to prevent this is with a brace, which pushes up from the bottom of your case to the far end of the graphics card, holding it level and preventing all that force from affecting the card or the PCIe slot. You sometimes get a support brace like this free with your graphics card, but otherwise you can pick one up fairly inexpensively from a range of manufacturers.

You can tune in on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central to join in on the fun, or catch the archive when it hits on our Game Informer Shows YouTube channel. 
Released in October 2014 as a Wii U exclusive, Bayonetta 2 is a sequel that almost didn't happen. Despite a strong critical reception to the first game, sales didn't meet expectations, leading to publisher Sega passing on a follow-up. Thankfully, Nintendo swooped in to fund and publish Bayonetta 2, locking it in as a third-party exclusive. Bayonetta 2 features improved combat, new features, an even nuttier plot, and a near-bottomless well of action. Join me, Marcus Stewart, as I dig into my personal GOTY for 2014 and chat all about our Bayonetta 3 cover. 
Watch on Twitch!

The action platformer came out on PlayStation late last week, but it's not coming to Steam until November 11th. So far, reviews have been quite middling, which isn't wholly surprising in some sense, but having played the public demo the other week, I'm not ashamed to say that I had a pretty all right time with it! Based on two hours of play time, I'd say it's very much in the same kind of vein as your Bayonettas and Nier: Automatas, and I'm 100% down for that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It feels odd saying "Overwatch 1", but Overwatch 1 occupies an important place in my personal and professional life. And all things considered, I do not miss it in the slightest. I spent so much time straining against the game's tug-of-war matches that I simply grew tired of trying really hard at it - or perhaps more accurately, trying not to launch my head through the nearest plaster wall.
Clearly, there was a time where I adored Overwatch, though. A time when I'd grind solo-queue most evenings until 3am, in a bid to climb the ranks ever higher. To what end? My own personal satisfaction, I suppose. I'd eventually hit Master (let me brag just once, okay) and then a few months later, I applied for a job at Gamer Network writing guides about Overwatch's intricacies. I moved to Brighton for my first proper job. Now, with Overwatch 2's release, it all feels like it's come full circle.

I might even come to love it, considering it's already so enjoyable even with a few years of early access left (a fact I forgot until I reached a "work in progress" marker several hours in).
You climb a tower and splat monsters and culty magic nerds. You loot, and avoid traps, chug red liquids, and occasionally die and have to start again. But I enjoyed every moment, and never once hit the usual aggravating points that push me out of the genre. It's good stuff all round, frankly.

Weird RPG does have some fun ideas but sadly, it's too mundane an ARPG to be truly weird—or good. Still, I was delighted when I found a helmet whose stats get better the worse your graphics card is.

Curious, he decided to pursue more knowledge, and landed in the Nier modding Discord server. 


Like him, many other Nier: Automata players who caught wind of the phenomenon sat upright - metaphorically and perhaps literally - and flocked to both Reddit and Discord to check out what exactly was up with the secret area.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mortal Kombat was released three decades ago, in October of 1992, and its gory style of fighting has persisted through the years, through controversies, movies, and more. 
The NetherRealm-developed series celebrates its 30th anniversary this month, and the studio has released a new trailer to highlight the legacy of the franchise and bathe players in nostalgia and hype. If you're looking for a special Mortal Kombat announcement, though, keep your expectations in check. Maybe something like that comes at a later date this month – who knows? – but today's trailer is all about Mortal Kombat's 30-year history in video games and other entertainment mediums. 
Check out the Mortal Kombat 30th Anniversary trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, the video above doesn't announce any new movies or games, or even DLC for Mortal Kombat 11, but that's okay because it's still a great watch nonetheless, especially for longtime fans. 
Here are some fun Mortal Kombat 30th Anniversary logos as well:

Now, Hallada’s written about the experience of creating the tool in a blog post, and the reasons for taking on the project.

That one! The one with the robots and the Soviet Alien dot detector thing!" The most recent trailer for The Invincible arrived during this year's E3 madness, and featured astrobiologist Yasna having a suspenseful encounter with a big spider bot and its anti-matter death ray. It was only a five-minute long clip at the time, but I've now played an expanded version of that particular scene, and yep, I still don't much like the look of that there laser bot.

They say it's faster and better. I think maybe it is? But it doesn't really matter, as long as it's not a disaster, because it's not like you're using it unless you have to anyway. Just like Origin before it, the new EA app is an inconvenience you must accept to play the EA games which require it, and beyond that it is useless. It does an okay job of that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[More than six years after its original release, No Man's Sky is finally out on Switch today alongside the new Waypoint update, which brings the game up to a new 4.0 version. This update is live on PlayStation and Xbox consoles, Switch, and PC as of today. 
As for what to expect, Waypoint is best described as a major overhaul to No Man's Sky geared toward making the game easily tailored to players, regardless of the experience they're trying to get out of it. If you want something more relaxing and casual, you can do that. If you want a more challenging experience, the Waypoint update lets you do that too. 
"Access the universe of No Man's Sky from anywhere in update 4.0 Waypoint, launching for the first time on Nintendo Switch, and overhauling fundamental elements of gameplay including game modes, inventory size, and usability, milestones, journey cataloging, and much more," the No Man's Sky Waypoint blog post reads. "Tailor every aspect of the game to your unique playstyle with custom game modes. Launch into the action quickly with an existing difficulty preset, or tinker with everything from economy to combat challenge to survival difficulty to perfect your experience." 
Alongside today's Switch release and Waypoint update, Hello Games has released a new trailer giving a tease of what to expect in the 4.0 version of the game: 


As you can see, Waypoint is bringing a lot of changes to No Man's Sky. Alongside game mode customization, there are also new seamless auto-saves, the launch of trade rockets, a new inventory overhaul with streamlined item management, unique Switch rewards, and so much more. Be sure to read the entire Waypoint blog post for all the details.

More specifically, it begins November 11 at 4 p.m. PT/7 p.m. ET. This is perfect timing because it's a three-way battle between Grass-type Pokémon, Fire-type Pokémon, and Water-type Pokémon, the types of the three starters we'll be choosing from in Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet on November 18. Check out the announcement tweet for yourself below: 
Grass-type. Fire-type. Water-type. This debate has perplexed our great philosophers for ages. Let’s settle it.
#Splatfest collaboration begins 11/11 at 4pm PT!

The event will begin on November 11 and it will run through 4 p.m. PT/7 p.m. ET on November 13. While nothing is confirmed just yet, the image released alongside today's news seems to tease some Pokémon-inspired gear. Hopefully, we all get to show off our favorite of the three types in our gear and weapons of choice. It's also worth noting that Nintendo calls this Splatfast a "special...collaboration" so there might be even more  Pokémon integration than we expect. Only time will tell. 
In the meantime, read Game Informer's Splatoon 3 review and then watch this 14-minute Pokémon Scarlet and Violet trailer released yesterday.

With just two weeks to go until the October 21 release date, marketing for Gotham Knights has begun to ramp up. We recently went hands-on with the game, and you can read our impressions and key takeaways about how it plays now, and recent videos have shared some of the behind-the-scenes inspirations for the game's narrative design. But now, as the official release date draws nearer, WB Games Montréal is bringing the hype. 
Check out the Gotham Knights launch trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, Gotham Knights' story of the Court of Owls and how they interact with both the Gotham Knights – Batgirl, Nightwing, Robin, and Red Hood – as well as other Gotham villain mainstays like Penguin, Mr. Freeze, Clayface, and Harley Quinn is shaping up to be something exciting for the Bat-verse of games. Fortunately, we don't have to wait too much longer now to experience it for ourselves because Gotham Knights hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on October 21. 
Which of the Gotham Knights will you be maining? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

This news comes after weeks of Kojima teasing a face with the words, "Who Am I?" in bold white letters. The face was obscured due to some neat shadow tricks, but right from the jump, fans tried determining whose face it might be, and it didn't take long for Fanning to become the frontrunner. Continual teasing led us to yesterday, when Kojima finally released the images below, confirming Fanning as the face in question.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Bayonetta 3's first gameplay trailer hit last year, her new braided hairstyle caught the attention of fans for its resemblance to the look of Cereza, the little girl who tagged along with players in the first game. Spoiler for Bayonetta 1: Cereza is the child version of Bayonetta, so perhaps our hero simply wanted to return to her adolescent roots. However, the third game's focus on the multiverse has prompted some fans to consider a more tantalizing theory. 
First, to provide some context, here's a (relatively) quick refresher of Bayonetta's backstory for newcomers or lapsed fans. Five hundred years prior to the events of the first game, Bayonetta, whose real name is Cereza, was born the child of an Umbra Witch and a Lumen Sage. Since the light-worshipping Sages were rivals to the da…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo has released the first trailer for its upcoming Super Mario Bros. movie and it features plenty of the famed plumber as well as Toad, Luigi, Bowser, the Mushroom Kingdom, and more. It also features our first listen to Chris Pratt's Mario.
Pratt teased back in June that his Mario voice is "unlike anything you've heard in the Mario world," and it turns out he's right in that we've never heard Pratt's voice in the world of Mario, which is to say his Mario just sounds like him. Elsewhere in the trailer, which aired during a special Nintendo Direct all about the film today, we get a glimpse at the movie's villain, Bowser, who is voiced by Jack Black, Toad, voiced by Keegan-Michael Key, and even a quick shot at Luigi at the end. 
Check out the Super Mario Bros. movie trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, Super Mario Bros. looks like you'd expect, in line with Illumination's other animated movies like Despicable Me and Minions. It looks like it will be a great time at the theater, making the wait until its silver screen release on April 7 that much harder.

They've also made the Steam Deck's dock available to purchase. It costs $80/£80 and has the same 1-2 week delivery estimate as the Deck itself.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When the mysterious sci-fi action shooter Scars Above was first unveiled during Geoffcom's Opening Night Live at the end of August, I thought it had big Returnal energy. Based on the reveal trailer, it certainly seemed to be riffing on several of the same themes as Housemarque's challenging PlayStation exclusive - what with its lone female scientist stranded on an alien planet schtick, third-person shooting, and big eerie alien monsters after her etc. - so when I saw it was part of this month's Steam Next Fest demo bonanza, I knew I had to give it a try. And while it certainly captures the same kind of atmosphere as Returnal, I'm sorry to say that's about as far as the comparison goes, as the rest of Scars Above is a much slower, more traditional kind of space action game.

Within just the last few years, we've not only had many releases, but an impressive proportion of well-designed, enjoyable games made with obvious care and enthusiasm. Things, in a word, are good. And yet I keep coming back to Ostriv, and Workers & Resources. Neither are out of early access yet. But they've had me contemplating the nature of a settlement, and the complex relationships between people, leaders, and the land itself, where so many of their peers feel like a dispassionate excercise in placing tokens.
Building games are doing well. But they could be doing more.

Substantially pimped-out vehicle, might I add, courtesy of rapper and general lad A$AP Rocky. Take a look at his motor in the trailer below.

        <updated>2022-10-06T14:06:20.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EA has officially revealed Need For Speed Unbound, the first new Need For Speed game in three years, and it hits new-gen consoles and PC this December. 
After leaking earlier this week, EA has released the official reveal trailer for Need For Speed and as leaks and rumors suggested, it's quite a drastic shift in style for the series. It features the slick realistic visuals fans of the series know quite well but this time, it's mixed with an almost anime-like animation style. It looks great, in my opinion, but it likely won't be for everybody. 
Check out the Need For Speed Unbound reveal trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, Unbound represents a pretty drastic departure for the series in terms of visuals but elsewhere, it looks like Need For Speed. There seems to be plenty of car customization, cops to run from, city streets to speed through, and if the reveal trailer's song by A$AP Rocky is any indication, a great soundtrack.
Only time will tell but fortunately, we don't have to wait too long because Need For Speed Unbound hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on December 2. As you might have noticed, the reveal trailer doesn't mention consoles from the previous generation, like the PlayStation 4 or Xbox One, so you might need a current-gen machine to play the game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last month, I enjoyed playing Card Cowboy, a wee wild west adventure which uses cards to tell silly stories. As you cross the land in search of revenge, you build a hand of cards representing resources and events, which you use to resolve situations—often with strange and surprising results. What does happen if you try to lasso a villain with a mezcal worm? That free version was fun, and now the devs have expanded it into a £2 paid version with new cards, conundrums, and voice acting. It too is fun!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since the launch of Overwatch 2 earlier this week, the game has struggled in a number of ways. Some players are excited about the numbered sequel while others wonder why this wasn't just a big update for the original Overwatch, which is no longer accessible. Regardless, actually playing Overwatch 2 has been its own challenge due to at least two DDoS attacks Blizzard has weathered, making it tough to actually queue into the game and access it beyond the eternal loading screen. 
On top of that, some players have found themselves unable to play once logged in due to the game's SMS Protect system, which requires you to give Blizzard a "unique" phone number for authentication purposes. The only problem is that pre-paid phones, which make up not just the boxed phones in stores like Walmart but m…]]></summary>

Ahead of Modern Warfare 2’s eruption on October 28th, rumours are circulating that Sledgehammer Games will return to the near-future world of their 2014 boots-off-the-ground instalment, Call Of Duty: Advanced Warfare.

The laundry list of issues that the team are investigating this month has a raft of fun werewolf-centric bugs like humans being able to sniff each other, and a wolf getting mad that he's the bottom (of the pack) even though he's the alpha. The High School Years update from July is also facilitating accidental sibling incest, still, after one method of sibling highschool be-sandwiching was fixed in August. It appears to be an entrenched problem. Those kids must really like House Of The Dragon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over at Eurogamer, I kind of have a thing for LG's Fast IPS screens. This tech combines the best feature of TN panels - their incredibly fast pixel response times - with the traditional advantages of an IPS screen, namely gorgeous colours and wide viewing angles. These screens pop up in LG's 27GL850 and 27GL83A monitors, but are also used in Dell's even better S2721DGFA - and it's this monitor that's on sale today. With a code available here, you can take an extra £30 off a model that's already seen an £80 discount, dropping the price from £380 to £268 - an incredible deal for a monitor of this specification. I used the code $6ZZXZWLF0WV7D, but your code is likely to be different!
So what is this specification? Well, the S2721DGFA exists right at the sweet spot for gaming monitors too, with a 27-inch screen size, 2560x1440 resolution and 165Hz refresh rate. This spec is good because it's not too hard to drive, even with a mid-range gaming PC, but you still get a noticeable increase in clarity and fluidity compared to your standard 1080p 60Hz monitors. And with the Fast IPS screen that I was talking about earlier, you have a monitor that's equally well-suited to fast-paced, competitive shooters as it is slower-paced and more atmospheric games from a wide range of genres.

I have gone on about the Dell S2721DGFA a few times now, so I'll link to those previous posts so you can find out a little bit more about this monitor - and see how much it used to cost too! Suffice it to say, if you have a look at some reviews you'll see that I'm far from the only fan of this model, so I hope this deal is useful to you! Thanks for joining me once again and I'll see you tomorrow for more deals.

        <updated>2022-10-05T18:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last week, Google announced it plans to shut down Stadia on January 18. One of the less-discussed casualties of the news was that Tequila Works’ Gylt, a horror adventure game and the first Stadia-exclusive title, would disappear entirely. Thankfully, that won’t be the case.
Tequila Works has confirmed that it plans to make Gylt multiplatform in 2023. It doesn’t specify which platforms the game will become available on, but it’s a relief to know that one of Stadia’s few original gems won’t be lost to history. 
🎃 We bring terrific news: GYLT is going multiplatform in 2023! More info to come in the upcoming months.https://t.co/ON1pbiGsB9 pic.twitter.com/2sWdseym2G
October 4, 2022
Gylt launched in November 2019 alongside Stadia. It stars a young girl named Sally who searches for her missing cousin across a town haunted by evil spirits. The narrative also serves a commentary on bullying and depresssion. The game’s vibe and art direction evoke films like Coraline or Tim Burton’s animated works and channels games like Inside and Silent Hill. Gameplay emphasizes stealth, with players using a flashlight to defeat enemies. Despite its more innocent veneer, the game has its share of genuinely creepy moments, and I personally found it to be an enjoyable horror romp.
Will you be checking out Gylt before Stadia shuts down or wait to play it elsewhere next year? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony announced its new gaming loyalty program, PlayStation Stars, back in July, and the service is now live in North and South America. PlayStation users can sign up for the free program, but there’s one big caveat.
PlayStation Stars allows players to earn points and digital collectibles by completing “campaigns,” which range from completing small objectives while playing games to larger monthly challenges. Any PlayStation player can join Stars; you don’t need a Plus subscription. 
Completing campaigns also raises your Star Status, a leveling system consisting of four ranks. Everyone begins at Level 1, but doing things like purchasing games from PSN or earning a certain number of trophy rarities raises this level, increasing the quality of rewards you earn. 
Digital rewards, which Sony confirmed are not NFTs and cannot be resold, include models of old PlayStation consoles and characters from first-party titles. You can also redeem points to use as funds for your digital store wallet and to purchase DLC. Points remain available for 24 months after earning them. 
If you’re running to sign up now, there’s already a waitlist to join PS Stars. Sony states that new users will have to wait about two months after the date they register to be accepted into the program. It's unclear why this is the case, but one could assume Sony doesn't want to be flooded with too many memberships at once as it gradually gets the program off the ground. Registration also doesn't seem consistent yet, as some folks were immediately let in while others have been told to wait (and some others still can't access Stars in parts of the U.S. as of publishing). 
PlayStation Stars will launch in Europe, Australia, and New Zealand next week on October 13. To learn more about the program, including its handy FAQ, you can visit its official site here.]]></summary>

Gotham Knights launches in just a couple of weeks, and Batman fans have been excited – and trepidatious – about the Bat clan’s big family adventure. To find out how the project is shaping up, I took a trip to Warner Bros. Montreal to play two hours of the game. I spent time-fighting crime as all four characters, explored Gotham’s open world, and took down criminals alongside a co-op partner. I also chatted with the dev team to uncover more nuggets about what the adventure brings to the table. Here are some general hands-on impressions and intr…]]></summary>

Described as a “live tuning update”, the patch adjusts the difficulty of penalties and fiddles with dribbling speed for some players. These changes are already live in the game, but you’ll need to restart your FIFA session when the tuning update message pops up to apply it.

        <updated>2022-10-05T14:45:54.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bandai Namco has released a new trailer for the new-gen release of Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot alongside news that it hits PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S in January. 
More specifically, Kakarot comes to new-gen consoles on January 13, 2023, meaning we're just a few months away from this re-release. To accompany today's news, Bandai Namco has released a new trailer showcasing some of DBZ's most iconic moments alongside some comparison clips between the PlayStation 4/Xbox One version of Kakarot and the upcoming new-gen update. Unsurprisingly, it looks a lot better. 
Check it out for yourself below: 


Kakarot on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S features updated visuals that look even better than the original release and 60 frames-per-second gameplay. If you already own the game, you can upgrade to the new-gen version of Kakarot for free. 
This new trailer also teases what's to come in the game's second season pass. The first DLC is called Bardock: Alone Against Fate, and it's a new story arc. Two more story arc DLCs are in the season pass as well. Plus, Season Pass 2 owners will get a cooking item that increases HP and Ki defense. 
While waiting for January, read Game Informer's Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot review to find out why we think the game is flawed but still highly enthralling.

Similar to Capcom's Monster Hunter series, the central draw of Wild Hearts is the massive creatures and how you successfully hunt them down. You craft new weapons and armor along the way, growing stronger and stronger with each hunt, as you attempt to rid the land of Azuma of these beasts. The reveal trailer released last week gave some quick glimpses of what that looks like, but a new gameplay trailer showcases seven minutes of Wild Hearts gameplay.

Instead, the Umbra Witch is brought to life by veteran performer Jennifer Hale.

Newcomer developer Stubby Games and publisher Playstack revealed The Entropy Centre during the Future Games Showcase in June, and it immediately caught my attention.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Moonbreaker is an early access turn-based tabletop game by the Subnautica devs, and before you ask, no there isn't a Blue Eyes White Basking Shark piece that inhales everything on the board. There are, however, plenty of sci-fi people who wield spears and guns and do battle by spending a currency called Cinder, if that's your jam.
Whether you're new to tabletop strategy or already like bashing miniatures together, the game makes for a perfectly enjoyable time. I just don't know whether it goes beyond "perfectly enjoyable" into "thrilling", though, and that may be down to its lack of, well, lots of things. Give it time and it may just evolve into a game of serious depth but right now it's a bit too miniature to recommend wholeheartedly.

I left it there in 2016 after discovering a larger ship out in the wilds, but it's a decision that still haunts me to this very day. You see, I was so taken with my new set of wings that I failed to notice it didn't have a functioning hyperdrive attached, which is needed to punch through the atmosphere to visit another solar system. It also turned out that this particular planet didn't have any of the necessary resources to craft a new one either, leaving my only form of escape back in my tiny little starter ship – which, of course, was now nowhere to be seen. I spent hours looking for that little ship, but the planet was so vast that I never saw it again. 
Upcoming aerial survival game Forever Skies doesn't have lots of large planets to lose your only means of transportation in, thankfully. In its Steam Next Fest demo at least, the only things I was able to land my makeshift aircraft on were tiny, rusty platforms perched atop decaying skyscrapers on an Earth ruined by disease and an ecological apocalypse. But that fear of getting stranded somewhere I shouldn't be has never left me, and I'd be lying if I said I wasn't just a teensy bit scared of jumping down from my ship and finding I wasn't able to get back up to it again.

Overwatch took the gaming world by storm when it launched in 2016, thanks to its well-balanced roster of unique heroes and terrific objective-based, first-person-shooting gameplay. The game’s popularity endured through the years thanks to a wealth of new content like characters, maps, cosmetics, and game modes, adding to the terrific foundation. However, once the content dried up for Overwatch, the public interest followed shortly afterward. Overwatch 2 represents the re-emergence of one of…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Your host Wesley LeBlanc is joined by Game Informer editor Marcus Stewart to discuss Nier Automata: The End of YoRHa Edition, a new version of the game exclusive to Switch. The two discuss how the game runs and looks on Switch, how the experience holds up five years after its original release, and whether Nier Automata is still worth playing all these years later. 
While Nier Automat has, over the year, hit PlayStation and Xbox consoles, as well as PC, it has yet to reach a Nintendo platform...that is until this Thursday, October 6, when The End of YoRHa Edition is released. As for what to expect, this new edition of Nier Automata includes the following:
Nier Automata base game
All previously released DLC
New costumes exclusive to Switch
If you're wondering whether Switch is the platform to play this on for newcomers, or if you're wondering whether this new release is worth a replay, we have you covered in the latest New Gameplay Today, which you can watch below. Enjoy!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The year 1985 contained so many cultural touchstones: Queen’s legendary Live Aid performance, Coca-Cola’s infamous New Coke release, the first-ever WrestleMania, and much more. Likely the most crucial moment to readers of Game Informer was the debut of the Nintendo Entertainment System.
The NES pulled the burgeoning industry out of the “video game crash” and introduced countless iconic characters and franchises. It seemed like every hit property received a game at the time. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Top Gun, DuckTales, Dungeons & Dragons, American Gladiators: the list goes on and on. However, one iconic brand shockingly never made the transition into a NES game.
Garbage Pail Kids, which also debuted in 1985, was a trading card series that mixed the cuteness of the hit Cabbage Patch Kid…]]></summary>

Platinum Games’ long-awaited threequel doesn’t rest on the laurels of its beloved predecessors. Gaming’s favorite witch has new tricks up her sleeves in the forms of Demon Masquerade and Demon Slave, letting players utilize their demonic minions in combat in new, kaiju-sized ways. If one Bayonetta wasn’t enough, a multiversal storyline introduces several variants that bring their unique brands of flair. At the center of this crisis stands newcomer Viola, the second playable character and rookie Umbra Witch, who serves as a mysterious key to the game’s events.

This news comes by way of the studio's investor call today, in which the studio revealed Orion, the codename for its next Cyberpunk game. Not much else was revealed, but CDPR says Orion "will take the Cyberpunk franchise further and continue harnessing the potential of this dark future universe." 
Up next was The Witcher. CDPR has revealed that its next Witcher game, which was announced earlier this year, is being developed under the codename Polaris. The studio says "it is the beginning of a new saga" and that it aims to release two more Witcher games after Polaris, creating a new AAA RPG Witcher trilogy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo has revealed the first look at its upcoming Super Mario Bros. movie. 
Don't get too excited just yet – this first look isn't a trailer. But it is a new image showcasing our first look at the famed plumber in the Mushroom Kingdom of this movie, which is being made by Minions studio Illumination Entertainment. This image accompanies the announcement of a Nintendo Direct happening this Thursday, October 6, all about the movie. Nintendo specifically points out that there will be no video game news, however, so don't expect anything more than Super Mario Bros. 
Tune in at 1:05 p.m. PT on 10/6 for a #NintendoDirect: The Super Mario Bros. Movie presentation introducing the world premiere trailer for the upcoming film (no game information will be featured).

October 4, 2022
Here's a better look at it, too, courtesy of the film's first poster:
As you can see, this image reveals quite a lot. There's Toad, an antiques stall selling relics of Mario's past video games, plenty of pipes and platforms, and of course, Princess Peach's castle high above the rest of the kingdom. There's probably plenty more to glean from the image so have at it. 
This image is our first look at the movie, but during the Direct on Thursday, which begins at 1:05 p.m. Pacific/4:05 p.m. Eastern, Nintendo will formally introduce the movie with the first-ever world premiere trailer, so be sure to tune in. 
Super Mario Bros. hits theaters on April 7, 2023.
While waiting for this Thursday direct, read about how Nintendo is reportedly happy with the film and so happy, that additional Nintendo movies are likely on the way. Read about how Chris Pratt says his Mario voice is "unlike anything you've heard in the Mario world". After that, then check out this story about how a producer from the movie says Mario won't have an Italian accent in the film.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony might be interested in helping produce movies and television shows based on From Software games. 
This news comes by way of a new interview between Reuters and PlayStation Studios head Hermen Hulst, in which Hulst explains PlayStation's investments into its PC and mobile efforts as of late, as well as its recent investment into Elden Ring developer From Software. According to Hulst, "further investments in areas that will strengthen the expansion on to PC, on to mobile, and into live services" is definitely a possibility for PlayStation. 


However, more interesting to From Software fans perhaps is Hulst's answer when asked about Sony's investment in the studio. 
"You should think of collaborations on the game development side first and foremost, but it's also not unthinkable with our PlayStation Productions efforts that we explore opportunities," he said. 
While Sony has a 14.09% stake in From Software, that's not quite enough to make decisions independent of the studio's other investors, like Tencent, which acquired 16.25% of From Software around the same time Sony invested. So while PlayStation Productions might be interested in a Bloodborne horror movie one day or an Elden Ring TV series about Jar Bairn, for example, From Software and its other investors would likely need to give the green light as well. Here's hoping, though, because From Software's properties, be it Bloodborne, Elden Ring, Dark Souls, or something else, seem ripe for an on-screen adaptation. 
While waiting to see if anything comes of this, read about how Bloober Team is making a TV series adaptation and then read about how Sony is developing God of War, Gran Turismo, and Horizon screen adaptations after that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bloober Team has announced that its 2021 psychological horror game, The Medium, is getting a TV adaptation. 
The studio announced this in a new blog post today, as translated by Bloody Disgusting, which reveals Tomasz Bagiński, an executive producer for Netflix's Witcher series, and Bloober Team's own Piotr Babieno will oversee the show. 
"Both the film industry and the video game industry are close to my heart, and I am very happy that there is finally an opportunity to bring them both together," Babieno writes in the blog post, according to Bloody Disgusting. "The story we told in the game was appreciated by players, and now more people will be able to hear about it. The latest hits of streaming platforms based on games such as Cyberpunk: Edgerunners or Arcane have shown that this is the perfect time for such productions." 
As noted in Babieno's writing above, The Medium will join a slew of recent video game adaptations that have found great success, like Cyberpunk: Edgerunners (Cyberpunk 2077) and Arcane (League of Legends), and others still in development, like Sony's God of War, Horizon, and Gran Turismo productions.

Much like my Liverpool fandom over the past 20 years, I vacillate between happily obsessive and begrudgingly bewildered with FIFA. Like Liverpool, when FIFA works like a well-oiled machine, play on the field is beautiful, slick, and drives my football-loving brain to elation with dopamine hits. However, FIFA 23 feels like FIFA 22, which was similar to FIFA 21, with additions ranging from mildly impactful to invigorating.
FIFA has focused on one facet of soccer for years: the attack. It’s almost arc…]]></summary>

This premiere is being dubbed as the "first official” look at gameplay. That distinction likely means that the footage will be of a near-complete build of the game since developer Motive Studios has spent the last year releasing several behind-the-scenes videos showcasing gameplay in more unfinished forms. This transparent approach to Dead Space’s development has given fans raw looks at how the 2008 classic is being updated. Player feedback from these videos has even allowed Motive to make subtle but important changes earlier in the pipeline. With the game only a few months away, we're curious to see how all of that work has coalesced. 
Dead Space launches on January 27 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A remake or remaster of 2017's Horizon Zero Dawn is reportedly in the works alongside a new Horizon multiplayer game. 
This news comes by way of MP1st, which reports that its sources tell the publication that this remake/remaster will feature an improved lighting system, overhauled textures, better animations, and character models more in line with those of Horizon Forbidden West, Zero Dawn's sequel that released back in February. However, MP1ST notes that its sources didn't say whether this was a "built from the ground up" remake or a remaster – it might fall somewhere in between for all we know. 


According to MP1st, one of the project's big focuses (ha) is bringing Forbidden West's accessibility features over to Zero Dawn, something Sony did with The Last of Us Part II and Part I. As f…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rowing Blazers, a New York-based clothing brand, has announced a new line of Sonic the Hedgehog apparel. The collection draws inspiration from Sonic's aesthetic from the 1990s, with graphics inspired by art from the time. 
Those who are interested in the collection can look forward to clothing items like a cotton sweater with Sonic's image, a zip-up polar fleece, heavyweight rugby jerseys, a French terry loopback hoodie, cotton tees, and mesh shorts. The line also includes baseball caps, canvas tote bags, a necktie, and a hand-embroidered Sonic patch for blazers and other clothing items.
You can see a gallery of some of the items in the collection below.

According to Jack Carlson, founder and creative director of Rowing Blazers, which has done collaborations with FILA, Umbro, the NBA, and more, the company's creations all hold important links to his personal life.
"A lot of it has to do with the things I loved growing up: the sports, the brands, the culture," he said in a press release. "I grew up in the '90s playing Sonic the Hedgehog on the Sega Genesis. Sonic has always been such an interesting character to me. In the original games, he was a little bit brash, a little bit punk. He was different from other cartoon and video game protagonists. He was very '90s. Of course, there have been a lot of Sonic clothing capsules created over the years. I wanted to do something elevated, really beautifully made, and kind of timeless in its aesthetic. Of course, there's a kind of irony to it because Sonic himself isn't really very preppy, but that's the fun of it."
The collection retails as low as $38 to $325, though nothing is currently listed at the higher end of that spectrum just yet. The collection is live now, having launched yesterday. If you'd like to check out the collection for yourself, you can head here.]]></summary>
