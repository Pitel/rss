While we already know Dr. Eggman and Fang will be making a return, it seems the official PR has revealed even more juicy details. In particular, Sonic designer Naoto Ohshima will be returning with a new character (so a villain) that blue blur and his friends will have to face.

We've already seen the 3DS eShop closure wipe out a lot of digital titles earlier this year, and now game publisher NIS America has announced two of its games from the Switch eShop will be disappearing in the coming weeks and months.
The first one is the RPG The Lost Child, originally released on the system in 2018, and the other game is God Wars: The Complete Legend - a tactical RPG released in the same year. NIS America hasn't provided any reason as to why these games will "no longer be available" but it does mention how it will apply to both the eShop and PSN across both the US and EU regions.

There have been rumours for some time now about Atlus releasing even more Persona games, and it seems the company's western branch has now accidentally revealed not one but two of them ahead of schedule.
Trailers for Persona 3 Reload and Persona 5 Tactica were both shared on the Atlus West Instagram page before being taken down. It looks like they were intended for the Xbox showcase, with the platforms listed as Game Pass, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One and Windows. A separate listing also makes reference to a PlayStation and PC version of the Persona 3 Remake.

Blasphemous 2, which was only revealed back in April, looks to be similar to the fist game, i.e. it's a side-scrolling Soulslike drenched in the most bloody and grim Christian imagery you can think of.

Just before Devolver’s Summer Game Fest 2023 stream, Grasshopper Manufacture has given a tease of a remastered version of its 2011 cult classic, Shadows of the Damned.
Uh… the teaser is bizarre, to say the least, but it eventually shows off the goods with a few quick scenes from Shadows of the Damned. It looks to be a remaster in the strictest sense, as those shots certainly smell of the Unreal 3 Engine.
https://youtu.be/xMnx6H91pqg
Beyond that, there isn’t much to see, but more is promised for June 14 at 21:00 PST.
I’m curious to see if Suda51 and Shinji Mikami will be doing anything in terms of “director’s cut” content. Its development was reportedly wrought with corporate interference from EA. But then, I’m not sure if EA is even going to be involved here.
I suppose a straight port to new hardware would be something worthwhile. I wasn’t a huge fan of Shadows of the Damned, even as a fan of Suda51. However, I would probably give it another chance with a remastered version. So, bring it on.
We’ll find out more about it on Wednesday, but for now, we just know that the Shadows of the Damned Remastered is “coming soon.”

While there's some familiar names in the pack like Hyper Light Drifter and Coccoon, there's a whole host of surprises in there. And that's thanks to the folks over at Double Fine Productions, iam8bit, and PlayStation's indie champion Greg Rice who put all of this together for us to enjoy each year.

I had no idea that its creator Bennett Foddy was going to reveal a new game tonight. That game is called Baby Steps, it's being made with the makers of Ape Out, and it looks like a mixture of QWOP and Getting Over It set in a beautiful 3D world. There's an excellent trailer below.

Well, they weren’t even leaked; they were posted accidentally on Atlus’ English-language Instagram page, making them official leaks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Someone is in trouble
Not only was a Persona 3 remake entitled Persona 3 Reload leaked on Atlus' Instagram, but also a strategy title called Persona 5 Tactica.
https://twitter.com/junoharuto/status/1666934463199059978?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1666934463199059978%7Ctwgr%5E1484ee3139010faa9330d607bdb86b9281ddc96c%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pushsquare.com%2Fnews%2F2023%2F06%2Fpersona-5-tactica-launches-17th-november-persona-3-reload-early-2024
As the name implies, Persona 5 Tactica takes the cast of the fifth Persona to the world of tactical RPGs. The trailer makes it sound as though the gang has been transported to another world. A world of tactics, I'm guessing.
The title briefly popped up on Atlus' Instagram page, and the trailer for it was quickly seized and disseminated across the vast expanses of the internet. This occurred simultaneously with Persona 3 Reload which we covered in a previous post. There's no jamming this sleeping bag back in its sack.
While Persona 3 Reload has a much more vague release date, Persona 5 Tactica is slated for November 17, 2023. Currently, only Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC have been announced. However, keep in mind that this looks to have been meant for a Microsoft stream, and they don't typically advertise when a game is also going to be on other platforms.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Uh oh!
Try to act surprised later this week when this gets officially announced, but apparently, the Persona 3 remake is real. It's titled Persona 3 Reload,  and if you look quickly, a trailer has been disseminated around the internet.
https://twitter.com/ScrambledFaz/status/1666934712412131330?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1666934712412131330%7Ctwgr%5E17a14df9fc20ca028b9e94daa02ecf1d40c0c56c%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pushsquare.com%2Fnews%2F2023%2F06%2Fpersona-5-tactica-launches-17th-november-persona-3-reload-early-2024
A remake of Persona 3 has been rumored for quite a while. Some have speculated that it was partially the reason that we got Persona 3 Portable remastered for modern consoles instead of Persona 3 FES. There were even further leaks later on, but their credibility was somewhat in question. Not totally unbelievable, but not proof positive.
However, it looks like someone on Atlus' Instagram account hit post instead of schedule, and the cat got out of the bag. Not only is Persona 3 Reload on the docket, but there is also another spin-off title headed our way called Persona 5 Tactica.
Persona 3 Reload looks to be a top-to-bottom remake of the classic PS2 title. Currently, it's slated for Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC in early 2024. Since this looks like it was going to be part of a Microsoft stream, I wouldn't take that as the gospel. They just wouldn't advertise it being on anyone else's platform.

It seems to have been one of those things where a few years back a bunch of devs all noticed that there hadn't been one for a while, but didn't realise they weren't the only ones to have noticed until the games all started coming out. Anyway, Saber Interactive revealed John Carpenter's Toxic Commando, to be published by Focus Entertainment, at tonight's Summer Game Fest. It's an 80s-inspired FPS for up to four players, and you shoot a bunch of zombs.

It's a third-person action RPG from the makers of Vampyr and Life Is Strange that's about smashing monsters, but its pair of ghost-hunting protagonists are also lovers. A new trailer was shown during tonight's Geoff Fest.

The Day of the Devs selections usually don't disappoint, and this year's Day of the Devs held after the Summer Game Fest 2023 kick-off stream was solid. Alongside some games we knew of beforehand, there were some exciting new announcements, both from known creators and newer teams in the scene.
From the Chicory team's latest endeavor to a mind-bending world-moving puzzle game, there's a little something of everything. If you missed the stream, or are just looking to find that one game you have a foggy recollection of, here's a recap of everything shown.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For the past three months, I've been gasping to tell someone about the next game from the makers of Mutazione. I got to see a sneak peak of it back in March at GDC, but I've been sworn to secrecy ever since. But at long last, Saltsea Chronicles has made its debut at tonight's Day Of The Devs stream, and I can finally unburden myself and let out 90 days' worth of fizz pop excitement for this gorgeous new adventure game. 
Set on a flooded, post-apocalyptic Earth, creative director Hannah Nicklin described it to me like this: "What if you were watching Star Trek, but you get to choose where they go, who's on the adventure and what they get to say?" It's a tantalising premise, especially when it's all packaged up in the same crisp, pastel colour palette as the perpetually stunning Mutazione. The Star Trek reference isn't just for show, either. You might only be visiting different islands rather than whole planets during the course of Saltsea Chronicles, but it does have a natty, Alexander Courage-grade theme tune that plays between its chapters. The most exciting thing about this oceanic trek, however, is its incredibly cool save system that lets you dip in and out of different story branches to explore different paths and opportunities as you see fit. Let me tell you all about it.

From his humble beginnings as a young man hitting punks with bicycles in Yakuza 0, through his brief time leading a crime family after hitting punks with bicycles, all the way through to hitting a punk with a bicycle for the apparent final time in Yakuza 6, I've loved watching him take half of Tokyo under his wing, and loved watching him hit punks with bicycles. Seeing him back in action in a new trailer for the upcoming Like A Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name, aw, I wish Sega had let Kiryu retire. My poor dad earned it.

Epic Games has revealed the debut cinematic trailer for Chapter 4 Season 3 of Fortnite — Fortnite Wilds. teased on Twitter just a few days ago, Fortnite Wilds throws players into a jungle biome full of dinosaurs and dangers.
Not only that, but Optimus Prime is officially coming to the game as a new skin. Doctor Slone is also returning to Fortnite, and there are tons of new additions such as Rideable Raptors, grind rails, a new Mythic, and — of course — new weapons.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some time back I made fun of the preview for Immortals Of Aveum because a) it was quite a silly hands-off preview and b) Immortals Of Aveum is very clearly a game that needs to be played to properly get to grips with it. It's out on July 20th, so not too far away. Have I played it yet? No! Of course not! But we're getting closer to a hands on, and after a six-minute video of the magic FPS in action last month, tonight's Summer Game Fest threw us a big, bombastic boss fight on top of a steampunk Jaeger, or something. I dunno, it was hard to tell over the light show. Those sure are a lot of magical fireworks going off. I like it. Jangle some more keys in front of me, games man.

The video itself is, uh, well, it's not long, and it's quite choppy. While I enjoy a good setpiece, my concerns remain the same as before, i.e. the magic shooting, despite the different flavours of magic broadly corresponding to a different kind of gun, looks pretty weightless, and the enemies look bullet spongey. I do like the colours and the traversal, though.

The "Summer of Gaming," aka "not-E3" kicked off at 3PM ET on June 8, 2023, and our old pal Geoff Keighley was available for more hard-hitting game trailer reveals and lighthearted DoorDash ad reads. Seriously, good recovery on that one!
So what did we get this year? A decent chunk of AAA and indie reveals across a large spectrum of genres, and a big Final Fantasy finish. Naturally, as it is prone to do, Final Fantasy (or more specifically, Final Fantasy 7) stole the show with a "one more thing" and gave us a smoldering Sephiroth shot, as well as confirmation that Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth is out in 2024 on two discs. I can't wait to see the final installation size.

As part of 2023 Summer Game Fest, Square Enix has shown off a rather heaping helping of gameplay from Final Fantasy VII Rebirth.
https://youtu.be/mskzZjJjQg0
It looks pretty great! It starts off showing the aftermath of the first game before showing off the world you'll be exploring. There are a number of re-imagined scenes that will be familiar to anyone who played the original title, as well as some new surprises. There's an especially big twist that I don't want to spoil in case you don't want to watch the trailer and prefer to go in blind. I respect that.
Perhaps the most exciting information here is that Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is slated for early 2024. But most excitingly is that it's coming on two discs. In this economy? I can't remember the last time I saw a game come on two discs without it actually being two separate titles. Wow!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Summer Game Fest concluded with the first big look at Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, the next chapter of Final Fantasy VII Remake. A lenghty trailer gave us some good looks at its gameplay, story, as well as a much-anticipated release window. 
The story sees Cloud and the gang explore beyond Midgar to stop Sephiroth’s plans, and we see looks at the grander Final Fantasy VII story, likely to be laden with new twists. In terms of new faces, get to see Elena join Reno and Rude in the Turks, and Yuffie, the fiery Wutai ninja introduced in the Intermission story expansion, officially joins the party. 


Perhaps the most surprising revelation is that Rebirth will come on two discs. Given how much storage a single Blu-ray can hold, that suggests that Rebirth could be a mammoth-sized experience, which is wild given that it’s only Part 2 of a planned trilogy of games. We also now know that Rebirth is coming in early 2024 exclusively to PlayStation 5.]]></summary>

We now have our first in-episode footage of Peacock's upcoming live-action adaptation, Twisted Metal. As debuted during this afternoon's Summer Game Fest, the clip featured our ragtag protagonist (Anthony Mackie) squaring off against serial killer clown and poster villain Sweet Tooth (Samoa Joe).
And honestly... it was pretty fucking rough.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Mn4RBWv03A
For some reason, the decision was made to showcase a clip from the show that doesn't actually feature any cars whatsoever. It does, however, feature some daylight-bad punches, sub-MCU comedy, and Sisqo's 1999 hit, The Thong Song. I'm a big Twisted Metal fan, and I absolutely do not mind when other media plays with, rearranges, or even reinvents popular worlds and characters in new and exciting ways.
But this clip was... not good. It wasn't funny, it looked kinda cheap, the displaced Sweet Tooth voice is distracting, and the sense of humor seemed tonally lost both within its own universe and on the silent, slow-clapping Summer Game Fest audience.
Being generous, we'll put this down to a bad choice of clip and see how it all goes down on July 27, when Twisted Metal premieres exclusively on Peacock...
...Imagine the producers: "One rule for the Twisted Metal show reveal. No Cars."

T'is the season for ARPG fans, it appears. Diablo 4 is out, Path of Exile 2 was shown during Summer Game Fest, and now we have another title in the genre competing for our time. In this case, it's Lysfanga from Sand Door Studio, which brings its own twist to the formula.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDRfAVyW0aw
What will hopefully separate Lysfanga from the competition is a time traveling mechanic. By rewinding time, Lysfangha's protagonist will create specters of her past self that fight alongside her. While we've seen similar mechanics in other games, it's still a neat concept to see pop up across different genres.
While a release date was not nailed down, we did get a reveal that the title would arrive later this year on PC via Steam and Epic Games.

After 13 years the sort of Twin Peaksy, sort of Stephen Kingy action adventure game is getting a much-requested sequel this October 17th, although this time it's a survival horror, and Alan is sharing screen time equally with an FBI agent co-protagonist. Lake told us a little bit more about said agent Saga Anderson, leading into a first glimpse of "raw gameplay" (as opposed to cooked?) that showed her in action. I have to say, my first impression is that Saga is a terrible FBI agent who is going to ruin the chain of evidence if this ever goes to court because this woman will not put on gloves to handle a goddamn thing.

Previously announced during the September 2022 Nintendo Direct, Fae Farm is again in the spotlight at Summer Game Fest. On top of a September 8, 2023 release date, it's also been revealed that it is coming to PC as well as the Switch.
https://youtu.be/Ro-bft9PF9A
The trailer shows off not only the farming, but also the magical hijinks you'll get up to. It's looking pretty cute, and it certainly shows off more technical chops than, say, Stardew Valley. It looks pretty friendly, if Stardew Valley wasn't friendly enough already. It has 4-person multi-player, if you need extra incentive.
Fae Farm is coming to PC and Switch on September 8, 2023.

        <updated>2023-06-08T20:30:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today during Summer Games Fest, we got our first extended look at gameplay for Like A Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name.
As previously revealed, Gaiden takes place between the events of Yakuza 6: The Song of Life and Yakuza: Like a Dragon, filling in the gaps of what longtime series protagonist Kiryu Kazuma was up to after faking his own death in the former before reappearing in the latter. 
From the looks of it, Kiryu, now being called "Codename Joryu," has been running jobs for a mysterious someone. As you might expect, this mainly means he's beating the holy hell out of dudes in the street. The trailer shows a variety of large-scale fights, as well as Kiryu's new fighting abilities, which include a rope-type weapon he can use to bring items and people closer to him.
Check out the trailer below:


As pointed out by Gematsu, Gaiden gameplay details actually leaked yesterday on the PlayStation Store. Here are some of the key details:
"Dynamically switch between the Yakuza and Agent fighting styles in visceral melee combat.
"With the Yakuza style, strike fear into enemies by unleashing wildly aggressive moves powered by Kiryu’s unparalleled strength and flair.
"Or up the ante with the Agent style by delivering blows with absolute speed and precision, while using an array of high-tech gadgets like electrified bind wires to stun enemies then send them flying.
"Strategically adapt to the situation and leverage both styles to dominate and destroy hordes of enemies."
"Whether you’re brawling in the secret Castle arena, singing a new karaoke song, enjoying a drink at the live-action cabaret club, or racing in the pocket circuit, the world offers a variety of immersive experiences.
"An intriguing informant named Akame also provides thrilling sub-missions, drawing you into an epic showdown that unfolds the more you explore and enjoy Sotenbori, Yokohama and the mysterious Castle."
Like A Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name will be released on November 9, 2023.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sick of losing cubes in Marvel Snap? This newest game mode might be the solution to your problems. Today during Summer Game Fest, Second Dinner's Chief Development Officer Ben Brode took to the stage to announce that Conquest, Marvel Snap's newest mode, will launch on June 13. The news was accompanied by a promotional skit featuring SungWon Cho, who you might recognize as Ratatoskr from God of War: Ragnarök. You can watch the trailer below.


Conquest Mode works similarly to Marvel Snap's Battle Mode. Two players are matched up for a series of games, each with ten units of health. Instead of wagering cubes, the currency players use to gain levels in the standard ranked mode, Conquest will have players wagering health. Unlike Battle Mode, which ends as soon as one player runs out of health, Conquest has players progress through tiers of competition, requiring longer winning streaks the higher they get. As a reward for making it to the top, players will receive exclusive cosmetics.
“It’s just insane how good players have gotten at Marvel Snap since we launched in the fall," Brode said in a press release. "For our most competitive, high-skilled players, we wanted to give them the ultimate challenge with Conquest. Players can now find out who truly is the best of the best and worthy of ultimate Marvel Snap glory!! What’s also super cool about Conquest is that the Proving Grounds can double as a great way to try out new decks, as Conquest has no impact on a player's Marvel Snap season rank."
Marvel Snap recently started its "Spider-Versus" season, which will introduce new cards such as Ghost-Spider, Spider-Ham, and Silk. The game is currently available on PC and Mobile devices and made it onto the list of our top ten games of 2022.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Phoenix Labs, the studio behind Dauntless, unveiled a much different project in the form of Fae Farm last year. As the name suggests, it's a cozy farming simulator that adds spellcasting to the mix, and a new trailer premiering during Summer Game Fest revealed it is launching on September 8.
Fae Farm takes place in the magical realm of Azoria, which requires your green thumb to help restore it to its former glory. That means tilling the land to grow crops, gathering resources by exploring, and decorating your homesteads both inside and out. You can farm alone or enlist help by inviting friends in online multiplayer (as well as locally on Switch). Check out some of the activities the game offers in the gameplay trailer video below.


Fae Farm will be available on Switch and PC via Steam and The Epic Game Store.]]></summary>

As part of Summer Game Fest 2023, Pocketpair has shown off more of Palworld, a “multi-player, open world, survival, crafting game,” that is definitely looking just like “Pokemon with guns.” Just look at that art style. Beyond that, it’s been revealed that it will be released into Early Access in January 2024.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXhfwoPJfm0
Along with this is a new trailer that hammers home how much Pokemon Palworld is going for. There’s fantasy, adventure, children, and then someone pulls out a minigun. I really can’t say I don’t see the appeal, but it’s hard not to raise an eyebrow at its intentionally derivative nature.
Palworld will be coming to PC via Early Access sometime in January 2024.

While we didn't get any new gameplay footage, we got two new pieces of concept art featuring the game's main villains, Kraven and Venom.
Venom was revealed in the original trailer for Spider-Man 2, but we didn't see anything more than his face at the very end. This art is our first look at Insomniac's take on the character. When asked about his identity, Intihar would only say that it was not Eddie Brock, leaving the man inside the symbiote a mystery. But if you've played 2018's Spider-Man, you've probably got a good guess as to who's inside. For the full interview, check out the video below.


Additionally, we got an official release date. You can check out a map twice as big as the last with twice the web-slingers when Marvel's Spider-Man 2 launches on PS5 on October 20, 2023.]]></summary>

The fun part of a showcase like Summer Game Fest is seeing how each game company handles its reveals.
Some opt for grandiose trailers to tingle our imaginations. But for Marvel's Spider Man 2, it needs no such fanfare. They simply had game director Bryan Intihar come on stage, talk about a few details, and then the bombshell drops. Marvel's Spider Man 2 launches on October 20, 2023. The crowd goes wild.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI9ym7wYf28
While a simple release date could stand on its own as a major reveal, we also gleaned some juicy new details about the upcoming PS5 exclusive. For example, Venom is "not Eddie Brock," as Intihar asserts that the team wanted to tell an original story with this title. Additionally, we also received news that the city "pretty much doubled in size." Pretty exciting!
Following the show, a post on the PlayStation blog confirms that pre-orders for the game will open on June 16. As has become common for major game releases, we have a few editions of the game to choose from. There's of course the standalone game for $69.99. For $79.99, we also have the Digital Deluxe edition, which comes with "2 additional skill points" and a handful of cosmetics.
[caption id="attachment_385338" align="alignnone" width="640"] Image via Insomniac Games[/caption]
That said, hardcore fans can sling for the $229.99 Collector's Edition, which contains a Steelbook case and a 19 inch statue of Venom fending off the Spider Men. Only a digital voucher for the game in this one though, which tickles my funny bone.
It's a tough act to follow a huge critical hit like the original Marvel's Spider Man, but it seems the team at Insomniac Games wants to surpass all expectations. We'll see how it measures up when Marvel's Spider Man 2 launches on October 20.

Last year we got word that The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria was in the works, and will deal with events taking place in the Fourth Age of the Lord of the Rings timeline (beyond the events of the core books). That's a pretty big deal, as that era of the franchise is rarely touched upon, even by Tolkien himself.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXvqhpGj6Gs
Well, we got another look at it today thanks to Summer Game Fest 2023, where it got a quick trailer segment. Even after that bit of footage, I still don't really have any idea of whether or not this will be good. Hey, even if it's not up to snuff, it'll be really hard to top Gollum was the "worst Lord of the Rings game" this year. That's something to look forward to!
The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria currently has a fall 2023 release window.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Larian Studios clearly wanted another easily detestable bad guy for Baldur’s Gate 3, so it turned to Harry Potter’s Lucius Malfoy to play one of the game's newly revealed antagonists. 
That would be actor Jason Isaacs, who portrayed the father of Harry Potter rival Draco Malfoy in the films. Isaacs will take the role of Lord Enver Gortash, designer of the Steel Watchers, magical warriors tasked with protecting Baldur’s Gate after Duke Ravengard vanishes. Players will bump heads with this powerful enforcer as they find themselves in the middle of a power struggle engulfing the city. You can see his introduction in the trailer below. 


"It was a thrill to join the Baldur’s Gate universe but I fear that the magnificent Lord Enver Gortash is being mischaracterized as a villain," says Isaacs in a press release. "In a brutal world of betrayals and butchery, he’s learned to lie better and backstab first. The joy in voicing him - apart from the obvious pleasure in getting to look so glorious - was that the creative team and I got to play loose enough to find ways that he could enjoy the ride and make the players hate him more!"
Isaac isn’t the only famous name players will encounter. J.K. Simmons (Portal 2's Cave Johnson, Spider-Man's J. Jonah Jameson) was previously revealed as General Ketheric Thorm. 
Baldur’s Gate 3 launches on August 31 for PlayStation 5 and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[(And featuring a bad Bon Jovi cover)
During Summer Game Fest, Saber Interactive revealed brand new monster shooter Toxic Commando, which is headed to PC and Gen9 consoles in 2024.
The trailer sees a pack of bastards gunning the engine through a throng of terrifying mutants, using all manner of wild weaponry to cut a swathe through hordes of decaying flesh. While en masse zombie shooters are not exactly few and far between, Toxic Commando is being produced by director (and passionate video game fan) John Carpenter, who is behind such movies as Halloween, The Thing, and Prince of Darkness.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqY8YoOkmIo
It will be interesting to see how Carpenter's influence instills itself in the final product, and hopefully helps Toxic Commando to break away from the typical first-person chaos of the many previous co-op zombie shooters that have come before. We still have a while to wait, as Toxic Commando will not be with us until some point in 2024, but given its Gen9 exclusivity and pedigree producer, it's an exciting prospect, guaranteeing a somewhat splatteriffic release.
Toxic Commando launches next year on PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X.

Said expansion, which is out on Wednesday June 14th (hey, that's soon!) is Black Desert's biggest expansion yet, taking players to a new region inspired by Korea's medieval Joseon era. Do I know anything about Black Desert? Hell no. But can I appreciate a boss fight with a many-tailed fox spirit? Hell yes. Always.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Palworld has always seemed too good to be true, given its vibrant world and amazingly absurd premise of inserting guns and survival features into a Pokémon-inspired open-world game. After a long wait, fans will finally get to try it for themselves early next year.
Developer Pocketpair revealed during Summer Game Fest that Palworld is launching in Steam Early Access in January. A long wait to be sure (especially since the game was last slated to enter Early Access this year), but we'll take any proof that this game is a real thing because it continues to look bonkers. 


Palworld takes place in a world where players can catch and befriend cute, legally-distinct monsters called Pals. The game features an open world that supports multiplayer (up to 8 players) where you can have Pals give a helping hand in battles or in exploration, put them to work making resources in your factories, sell them off, or just eat them. Combat unfolds as a third-person shooter with players wielding assault weapons and other guns to blast enemy Pals and other threats, or you can use Pal’s unique abilities to get the job done. In multiplayer, you can explore together, trade Pals, or steal each other's monsters and items in battle. 
What do you think of this latest look at Palworld? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alan Wake 2 got its first unedited gameplay showing during Summer Game Fest, with Remedy head Sam Lake divulging more details on the upcoming survival horror title.
Sam Lake offered further details on previously revealed factoids about Alan Wake 2. The game lets you play as Alan and newcomer FBI agent Saga, who each sport separate but connected campaigns. Players can switch between the two at any time, with Saga exploring the pacific northwest while Alan tries to escape the Dark Place. Since players can change characters freely, this opens up a plethora of storytelling differences; you can even play the full game as one character if you choose. 
The sequel’s shift to pure survival horror is shown off with the game’s heavy Resident Evil vibes as Saga riddles a terrifying killer with bullets while dodging his attacks. The trailer ends with some investigative gameplay, but we don’t get a long look at this part of the experience.


Alan Wake 2 launches on October 17 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC via The Epic Game Store.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[That's a lot of armor
As part of Summer Game Fest, Nexon has shown off a slice of their upcoming smashy medieval-fantasy multi-player game, Warhaven. They have also revealed that it will be free to try out as part of Steam Next Fest.
The trailer sure is a lot. A guy gets clobbered and dies. Then he’s revived. Then things get all explodey, and a bunch of dudes get knocked around. Oh, man. It sure looks like a thing.
https://youtu.be/hiJjooA4Vlc
I had to actually turn to its now-live Steam page to really figure out what I was supposed to be seeing. Warhaven touts 36-player battles and gives emphasis to its tactical side. It looks like a MOBA, and sure enough, in the steam tags, it says MOBA. Its art style reminds me of a less grim Souls game.
Warhaven will be free-to-play, and you’ll have a chance to try it out as part of Steam Next Fest (coming next week). The full release is planned for Fall.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yep, it still looks great
Live at Summer Game Fest 2023, Remedy Entertainment game director Sam Lake took the stage to give us the elevator pitch for Alan Wake 2: one of the least necessary pitches of the modern gaming landscape. Alan Wake 2 looks fantastic so far, but at the very least, we got an actual look at gameplay today. On stage, Keighty reminds Lake that the game was teased at The Game Awards in 2021 for a "2023" release. Well, it's 2023, and it already has a date: now we know what it actually looks like.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOr5gh2Kkqw
This is "early on" in the game, Lake confirms (in case you were worried about spoilers!), and Keighley calls it "raw unedited" footage. Saga (who has a pistol with a capacity of 12 rounds in the trailer sequence) is the core focus, as they walk up and enter an extremely creepy house, fighting off enemies in the process. There will be a "50/50 split" between the two main characters (Alan Wake and Saga Anderson), Lake says, and you can swap between them at "given points" in the story.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hm0AmdB9AM
Alan Wake 2 is still due out on October 17, 2023 on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The next stage in Project Sand Land
Summer Game Fest is here to reveal everything it has, ranging from release dates to gameplay. Since we covered the multimedia adaptation of Akira Toriyama's cult hit manga Sand Land late last year, Geoff Keighley's show's reveal of the game wasn't totally news. However, we did receive confirmation that this upcoming action RPG would launch on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Steam.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-h48hdeoEM
The footage we did see showed a lot of creatures, vehicles, and creatures in vehicles. A blog post by Bandai Namco Europe confirms that the Sand Land game comes to us via ILCA, who recently gave us One Piece Odyssey and Pokemon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl. Sand Land will focus on vehicular and character combat, which I imagine makes sense for readers of the manga.
I never as much as saw the source material for Sand Land until I conducted research for this article. However, since the game coincides with a "visual adaptation," it looks like Bandai Namco hopes to broaden the work's appeal. Will it work? Who knows! Even with this reveal, details remain scarce about the project.
Keighley noted "we're excited to see more of it soon" following the trailer. In other words, we'll hopefully learn more details about Project Sand Land soon.

The new game boasts a gorgeous art style that is unmistakably rooted in Toriyama’s style, and seems to mix action, vehicles, and fighting game mechanics together to tell a story set in a mysterious desert world.
It’s unknown at this point if the game will follow the same thread as the original manga. If it does, the story will follow a former general named Sheriff Rao as he tries to overcome a corrupt king with the help of the demon prince Beelzebub and his friend Thief. The three work together (including stealing a tank) to bring water back to a parched world.
There’s still much to learn about the video game adaptation, but the announcement trailer looked beautiful. Sand Land is headed to PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, but no word yet on release date.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sega and Sonic Team have announced Sonic Superstars, a new 2D adventure starring the company's Blue Blur. Though Sonic is the star, as the name implies, there are plenty of supporting cast members. In this reveal trailer, we also see Tails, Knuckles, and Amy appear as playable characters, each with their own unique abilities.
For the first time since Sonic Adventure, original Sonic the Hedgehog designer and artist Naoto Ohshima returns to the franchise. As the original designer of the Sonic the Hedgehog and Dr. Eggman characters, he will bring an all-new character to the franchise through Sonic Superstars. 
Sonic Superstars also introduces seven different Emerald Powers. In the trailer, we see Sonic create clones of himself and climb waterfalls, but the press release also teases "powering up." 
Taking place on the North Star Islands, Sonic Superstars purports to deliver never-before-seen environments, hinting that, despite the compilation-style name, we will be speeding through all new levels instead of the usual suspects like Green Hill and Chemical Plant. The press release teases enormous creatures and evil plans from Dr. Eggman, while Fang the Sniper (AKA Nack the Weasel) from Sonic Triple Trouble, Sonic the Fighters, and other games seems to appear as a secondary enemy.
In the trailer, we also see what look to be Special Stages that borrow from the rotating Special Stages from Sonic 1, plus a 3D Special Stage. The modernized HD graphics look great in motion, but the proof will be in how it plays, particularly following how disappointed many in the community were by Sonic the Hedgehog 4. If Sonic Team is able to nail the physics, momentum, and overall feel, Sonic Superstars could do for the 2D Sonic series what New Super Mario Bros. did for the 2D Mario series.
Sonic Superstars releases both digitally and physically for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC this fall, and will start at $60.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, over four years since the last entry in the series, we finally got a clear look at Mortal Kombat 1. Shown at Summer Game Fest, the trailer shows off a lot of gameplay, confirming a number of fighters: Scorpion, Sub Zero, Liu Kang, Kenshi, Kitana, Mileena, Raiden, and Kung Lao. You can watch the full reveal trailer below.


The ending of Mortal Kombat 11 allowed NetherRealm to rework the series a little bit, so this newest entry serves as a reboot of sorts. Classic characters have been put into new scenarios and have new relationships. For example, long-time rivals Scorpion and Sub-Zero are brothers now, and Liu Kang is a god of fire. Additionally, Johnny Cage is now being played by Jean-Claude Van Damme, an actor that inspired the creation of the original Mortal Kombat games.
Kameo fighters put an additional spin on the series' canon, with classic versions of characters like Kano, Sonya, and Jax jumping in to fight by your side. The new mechanic acts as an additional way to customize your characters, with a second roster available to choose as a Kameo after selecting your main fighter. While some fighters will likely be exclusive to the Kameo selection, Ed Boon has clarified that there will be some overlap – Sub-Zero can serve as both a Kameo and a normal fighter.
Mortal Kombat 1 will be released on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch, and PC on September 19.]]></summary>

Today at Summer Game Fest 2023, Nic Cage wandered on stage to present his upcoming Dead by Daylight cameo. Although it was teased recently, we got a full gameplay reveal, and a quick chat from the famous actor and pretty-good Elvis impersonator himself!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXDd0kKpCDM
Cage apparently recorded lines for the game, and says he joined the project (beyond the obvious reasoning of "money!") because someone he knows is a big fan of the series. He also hopes that he's able to sufficiently immerse players with his lines and performance, which will "fuse" players and him together as one entity. Yep, it was a Nic Cage thing to say! At least we know he wasn't an AI hologram. With Geoff's access to IMAX executive money, you never know what he's capable of.
You can check out the brief new footage revealed earlier today below. Nic Cage will arrive in Dead by Daylight on July 25. That's...something I never thought I'd have to type!

As part of the Summer Game Fest 2023, Capcom has revealed a crossover between their upcoming Exoprimal and already game Street Fighter 6. This is in the form of just, like, robo-Ryu and cybo-Guile. In other words, Exoprimal X Street Fighter 6.
https://youtu.be/J4ULvSYsmYc
All right then.
I test-drove Exoprimal a while back and came away with stories of butts. I guess this is… more butts. But recognizable butts. I guess it could work, I’m just not really seeing the value?
If you’re into piloting Ryu and Guile’s robot butts, then you’ll be able to do so this Fall in Street Fighter. In the meantime, Exoprimal itself is out on July 14, 2023.

During Summer Game Fest 2023, we got to finally see our first footage of Path of Exile 2. While we didn't learn many new details about Grinding Gear Games' next project, the timing for this reveal couldn't be more pointed. With Diablo 4 not even a week old at this point, ARPG fans are eating good these days.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s65fA1urV4E
While the trailer didn't show a release date, it does tease that more information will arrive on July 28. That coincides with the upcoming ExileCon, so it sounds like Grinding Gear Games has quite a show in store. Announcements for announcements will always sound funny, but I'm plenty curious to see what Path of Exile 2 has in store for us in this case.
In the meantime, you can play Path of Exile on PC, MacOS, Xbox, and Playstation platforms.

The news comes alongside a new gameplay trailer that premiered during Summer Game Fest, which shows off even more of the game's occult-themed gunplay. 


Witchfire is being developed by The Astronauts, the team behind The Vanishing of Ethan Carter, and centers on an alternate universe war between powerful witches and the Vatican church, with the player working for the latter to hunt down the former. The gameplay blends first-person shooting with supernatural abilities bestowed by the church. Creative director Adrian Chmielarz explained in an Epic Games blog post that the early access version will focus on fine-tuning gameplay first and foremost, with story elements being introduced over time.

Details are a bit scarce right now, but in the trailer, we see mecha-inspired Ryu talking with Exoprimal's artificial intelligence, Leviathan, who welcomes the fighter to Bikitoa Island. We also catch a glimpse of Ryu fighting dinosaurs. Ostensibly, all of this takes place within Exorpimal. It's to be determined if any of the crossover content will come to Street Fighter 6. The trailer concludes with a glimpse of Guile also showing up to Bikitoa, but concludes without any further info.
Check it out below:


While Exoprimal is out on July 14, the Street Fighter collab isn't expected until this fall. Interestingly, it's being billed as "Capcom Collab 1," implying future collaborations in the future, though no details were given.

One of the big guaranteed numbers at Summer Game Fest 2023 was a first look at Mortal Kombat 1's gameplay. And it's exactly what you expect from the franchise — ramped up to 11.
The trailer (which is almost definitely not Switch gameplay) looks utterly fantastic. Some of the fighters we got a good look at today were Kenshi, Mileena, Kitana, Liu Kang, Scorpion, Sub Zero, and — of course — Johnny Cage, who is being played by action movie star Jean-Claude Van Damme. Mortal Kombat creator (kreator?) Ed Boon confirmed the news on the stage after the trailer debuted, part of which was spent in Cage's house.

During Summer Game Fest, NetherRealm Studios released the first gameplay footage for its upcoming fighter Mortal Kombat 1. The sequel is coming to PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms this September.
The trailer gave us our first look at both the chaotic one-on-one action, as well as an all-new chapter in the long-running MK lore, (which, this time around, is another hit on the good ol' reset button). Additionally, we got konfirmation that the "Kameo Fighters," previously referenced on the official website, is, as expected, an assist system. This will allow players to mix up their roster by calling in playable and NPC kombatants from past and present.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mV175rgyH0k
In the trailer, we se veterans such as Sub-Zero, Scorpion, Johnny Cage, Liu Kang, Mileena, Raiden, and Kitana with assists supplied by Kameo fighters Sonya, Kano, Kenshi, and Jax, among others. Of course, we also saw some miserably gory, body-severing fatalities, along with what seems to be a return of the Mortal Kombat (2011) X-Ray mechanic, or at least some form of hard-hitting revenge system. While the game isn't looking a whole lot different from its predecessor, this was a positive first appearance.
Mortal Kombat 1 launches September 19 on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

Until then, though, here's everything else I can share about it right now, so ready yourselves for some cold, hard factoids. Here we go.

Today at the Summer Game Fest kickoff, Geoff Keighley and company revealed Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, a new platformer with a 2d-sidescrolling vibe. It's due out on January 18, 2024, and the listed platforms include Nintendo Switch, PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, PS5, and Amazon Luna.
Based on the footage, locomotion is an important part of the game's flow, with airdashing in clear focus. Combos are also seemingly possible, as the nimble hero Sargon is able to juggle and grappling hook enemies in, "get over here" style. Ubisoft Forward will have more info on this new entry in the Prince of Persia franchise.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Summer Game Fest 2023 opened its show with an impressive, unexpected announcement. The remake of Prince of Persia: Sands of Time is still in development, but Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown is a wholly new title that feels a bit closer to Prince's original 2D roots.


The gameplay showed an impressive mix of flashy combat and high-speed platforming – much faster then the methodical platforming that inspired it. The protagonist, who has historically always just been called the Prince, looks a bit like his Sands of Time iteration, but otherwise appears to be a totally new character named Sargon. Regarding the story a press release for the game reads, "In this brand-new adventure, players will embody Sargon, a young, gifted warrior, member of an elite group called The Immortals. As they are sent to rescue Prince Ghassan, they will explore Mount Qaf, a once wondrous place, now cursed and hostile. Sargon and his brothers-in-arms will soon discover that time itself will be a treacherous foe and that the world balance must be restored." The press release also says the game is inspired by "the Metroidvania structure".
Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown releases January 16 on Switch, PlayStation 5 and 4, Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One, Amazon Luna and PC through the Epic Games Store and the Ubisoft Store. Ubisoft promises to reveal more during its Monday stream event.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[#DiabloDeaths
Hollywood star Megan Fox is now starring in the newest Diablo IV commercial. Instead of just asking players to buy Diablo IV, she's asking them to die — in the game.
She begins the video by saying "If there's one thing I love, it's the sight of blood. And in Diablo IV, there are rivers of it". This alludes to Blizzard's new campaign where Fox herself will be eulogizing the deaths of some players who use the hashtag #DiabloDeaths. The idea might sound cool, but remember that she also states that it might not be a good eulogy. It's Megan and Blizzard who will ultimately decide whether players died as heroes — or total chumps. Only time will tell!
https://twitter.com/Diablo/status/1666166527953977345?s=20
The reading of the deaths will take place on June 8
Diablo IV has been collecting critical and fan appraisal, as well as selling like hotcakes despite its high price point. Diablo IV has proven such a remarkable comeback for Blizzard that I'm unsure if this was a necessary move. The idea in itself is kind of cool, but the execution feels pretty iffy: like an extremely '90s E3 vibe? That strikes a chord with some after all the awful things we've learned about Activision Blizzard in the past couple of years.

It's that time of year again, and I couldn't be more exhausted excited for it! In just about an hour from now, Geoff Keighley will take to the stage of Hollywood Park's YouTube theater for the Summer Game Fest 2023 kick-off show — An evening of exciting game trailers and picking up after yourselves.
We can expect updates, previews, and reveals from some of the biggest names in the industry, as they prod and poke our hype engines with the games that they'll be expecting $70+ for the rest of 2023 and beyond. Games set to put in an appearance include Alan Wake 2 and Baldur's Gate 2, as well as the first-ever gameplay trailer for NetherRealm Studios' Mortal Kombat 1. There are whispers of a release date for Marvel's Spider-Man 2, and we're still to see anything from Activision regarding the 2023 iteration of Call of Duty. And all this is just scratching the surface.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gY-lMH0R3AA
A pre-show will kick off about 30 minutes from now, with the presentation going live at 12:00 PT / 15:00 ET / 20:00 BST / 21:00 CEST. As always, the show will be way too long two hours in length, but we will all be on deck to bring you all of the latest news and updates, hurriedly typed and confusingly written in an all-out bid to please the Google Gods. We'd love it if you could join us for the show by following the stream above, and having your say in the comments below.
And, all jesting aside, I hope that you see at least one awesome game that gets the hype fires stoked.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The magnetism of a giant lady in a big ol' hat
Two years on from its initial release, (yep, two years), Capcom's gothic-horror title Resident Evil Village is still selling copies and scaring players worldwide — This morning, the publisher announced that the latest, (well, chronologically latest), entry in the survival horror series has surpassed eight million sales.
Resident Evil Village sees returning protagonist Ethan Winters journey into a grim European village, searching for answers following a violent attack on his home and family. There, he will encounter creatures and citizens beyond his darkest nightmare, coming face-to-face with a menagerie of monsters and demons, as well as the four lords of the land — namely Karl Heisenberg, Salvatore Moreau, Donna Beneviento & Angie, and the iconic Lady Dimitrescu, whose impact on the title's marketing, and therefore sales, cannot be overstated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKocYiRHYlI
Following the game's initial release in May 2021, an expansion pack, Winters' Expansion, was released in October of last year, which added new features and an additional campaign, Shadows of Rose. While the switch from "classic" Resi to the modern, first-person Resi has not been to everybody's taste, it cannot be denied that the evolution of the series has been incredibly impressive, borne out in both the critical and praise heaped upon the titles, as well as the titles' respective sales figures — A VR edition of Resident Evil Village was also developed to launch alongside the PlayStation VR2 hardware.
Resident Evil Village is available now on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch (via cloud)

If you’re looking for something grim, dark, and pixelated, then Bleak Sword DX is here to scratch that itch. It is difficult to pin down exactly what genre this game belongs to. It takes the core mechanics of a Soulslike and strips it back to its bare essentials. The deceptively simple graphics betray a surprisingly detailed art style that brings the desperate world to life.
Bleak Sword DX serves as an updated version of the 2019 mobile game, complete with a collection of DLC, a brutal gauntlet of boss fights, and an infinite mode to unlock by beating the game. The opening cinematic details a world where a kingdom has been under the thumb of an evil monarch for hundreds of years until a hero finally arrives to stop him.

I wasn’t really going to bother with Blizzard’s latest click-em-up (seriously, why is there so much mouse clicking??) but I’ve since joined in with the treehouse’s Diablo 4 spree and turns out that maybe there is a reason for me to play Diablo after all. Her name is Lilith.
Lilith is great. She’s a tall demon queen with giant horns, has a major chip on her shoulder, and she’s out to destroy both Heaven and Hell. She seems like the kind of gal who would eat a bunch of babies and puppies as a snack, and I love that for her. It’s great that Blizzard decided to finally bench the titular demon himself and let his terrifying niece have her moment in the spotlight instead.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Permanent price reduction until then.
Publisher Gun Media has released a statement on the future of Friday 13th: The Game, the multiplayer horror game which launched on Switch back in 2019. The game will no longer be available to purchase, "both physically and digitally" from 31st December 2023, as this is when the Friday 13th license expires.
On 31st December, the game will be removed from storefronts on all platforms and can no longer purchase. Because of this, Gun Media has decided to permanently reduce the game's price to $4.99, and all DLC will be priced at $0.99 apiece. At the time of writing this, the Switch's Ultimate Slasher Edition is listed for $19.99 on the eShop, but we'll let you know if that changes.

Lake: Season’s Greetings will roll the clock back eight months to before Meredith's time as temporary mail lady. You play as her father, Thomas, to whom it’s just another holiday delivery season. The developers outlined the scope of the DLC best, so I’ll pass it over to them for some bullet points.
It's the final days of the year, so expect Holiday Season happenings!
P.O. will be covered in a blanket of snow, and cheered up with lots of Christmas lighting.

It's a bright day for the Nintendo eShop, and I don't just mean that figuratively: like, the marquee games on offer are literally bright and in your face!
One of the most gleaning video game franchises of all time, Katamari Damacy, is getting a remaster this week in the form of We Love Katamari Reroll + Royal Reverie. It's a re-release of We Love Katamari with extras, including the ability to play as a "young King of All Cosmos" in challenges, and a selfie photo mode. Harmony: The Fall of Reverie is out as well, and the art style alone is worth checking out.
The rest of the week is a bit less packed than normal, but that's great actually! We could use a breather after the $70 Tears of the Kingdom and the flood of other releases.

The tweets are all in a Q&A style format, and most of the questions have been fairly innocuous things like "Will FF7 Rebirth have original music?" and "Has the battle system changed from FF7 Remake?" But the answers, at least on the English FF7 Twitter account, have been downright baffling, and have been promptly memed into oblivion. Things will happen to characters during the story, you say? No kidding! 
But thanks to some clever internet sleuthing, eager Final Fantasy fans are quickly realising that there's a lot more to these comments than meets the eye. Well, at least there is in the original Japanese versions of them. The English translation team clearly didn't get the same memo...

We have got our first look at this week's Japanese charts from Famitsu (via Gematsu) and despite a number of strong debuts, nothing was able to kick The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom from its top spot, selling another 78,602 copies this time.
Putting Zelda aside, however, we are left with a chart list that is full of new entries — what a treat! Atlus' Etrian Odyssey Origins Collection put up some pretty solid numbers for its debut, selling 38,656 copies and landing in second place, while We Love Katamari Reroll + Royal Reverie and Loop8: Summer of Gods both also sold well in their first week on Switch.

A fresh update is now available for Pokémon Unite, bringing the game up to version 1.10.1.1 and adding a new fighter in the process.
There have been a couple of additions this time around including the introduction of Leafeon into the mix and a brand new prize machine. It looks like the main focus, however, has been on removing bugs and making adjustments to certain fighter moves.

The king of the harvest, and the longest-running farming sim series going, Harvest Moon / Story of Seasons has been a Nintendo stable since its 1996 debut on the SNES. And even if Stardew Valley (which was inspired by this very series) may have taken the crop coronet in recent years, the series remains ever-popular for its charm, its cosy vibes, and its addictive farming gameplay.
Known as Bokujō Monogatari in Japan, this lovely farming series sees budding young farmers build up a farm from scratch, raising animals, growing crops, and making sweet with the locals. You can fall in love, marry, have children, and take part in festivals.

A little over a week ago we heard that another wave of DLC would be coming to Mario Kart 8 Deluxe "soon", thus beginning our speculation about what courses will be heading our way this time. While we were all thinking about additions to the current game, however, some eagle-eyed viewers of The Super Mario Bros. Movie on Reddit have spotted what they believe to be a teaser for a whole new entry in the Mario Kart series.
As noted by AutomaticSir411 on the r/mariokart Reddit forum, the pipes on the top of the Super Mario Bros. Plumbing van have several codes on them, one of which reads "221203MK10500N". To some (AKA, us) this looked like nothing more than a series of numbers and letters, but AutomaticSir411 speculates that the concluding "MK10500N" might, in fact, signify that there is a 'Mario Kart 10' coming 'soon'. Hmm.

I played through all of Superliminal, for example, and really enjoyed it until the very end when I got an inspirational lecture from an invisible scientist living in my ear - and I did not care for it. One game I played for literally half an hour and thought it was great, but I was not good enough to beat the first boss I came across. But I thought to myself, other people are better at Metroidvanias, and at least one of them might appreciate being nudged in the direction of a year old one I think is cute. Thus: Islets.

It looks like the pre-order bonuses are starting to emerge for Nintendo's next big release, Pikmin 4 (yes, we are jumping over Everybody 1-2-Switch! there). The European My Nintendo Store Twitter accounts have today revealed what is in store for those who pre-order Olimar's latest — a phone stand and the option of bonus keyrings.
Yes, you did read that correctly, the pre-order bonus for Pikmin 4 from My Nintendo Store EU is a phone stand, with three little guys sitting along the bottom. Look, it might not be exactly what we expected, but we'd be lying if we said that it wasn't kinda cute.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I had one question for Mask Of The Rose: Can I smooch the Cthulhu monster? I mean, I assume you can, they’re one of ten characters you’re able to romantically pursue in the delicious depths of this Eldritch dating sim. But in actuality, I simply don't know, because after ten-plus hours and multiple playthroughs, that all-important question remains unanswered. It’s not something unique to my dashing, tentacled suitor, either. Many of my romantic pursuits in the Neath totally fizzled out. It's giving Berocca when I wanted Coke and Mentos.
Mask Of The Rose is Failbetter’s visual novel dating sim set in the Fallen London universe, an already established alt-history Victorian London that the studio has been building over a decade as a quite excellent browser game. In this alternative history,  London has been dragged through the Earth’s crust by bats and now resides in a vast underground cavern called the Neath. With the economy literally in the pits and Queen Vicky refusing to leave her cushy palace, London has become somewhat unruly, turning into a lasciviously gothic underworld home to a whole parade of monsters, devils, living statues, cloaked beings with red eyes... basically the entire cast of the Goosebumps books.

The ScummVM Team is pleased to announce full support for the PC version of the first game of the Might and Magic series: Might and Magic Book One: The Secret of the Inner Sanctum. Two modes are supported:
The original look and feel of the game (sound, which in the original consisted of merely the occasional beep, is not supported)
A ScummVM-exclusive enhanced mode, which uses the interface of the later Xeen games, including niceties such as better character screens, automapping, and sound effects. It also integrates the impressive "Might and Magic 1 Graphics Overhaul Mod", which provides better in-game map and monster graphics. The xeen.cc file is required from Might and Magic: IV or Might and Magic: World of Xeen.
Both modes allow saving your game anywhere outside of combat via the ScummVM Global Main Menu (unlike the original game that only saved a single roster when checking into an inn). So make sure you save regularly, just in case you encounter problems.
Help us test both game modes by grabbing a daily build and adding mm.dat to the same folder as your game files. Read through our testing guidelines, and please take some screenshots along the way.
Now, go forth, and discover the true secrets of the game that started the long running epic fantasy series!

The PSU in question is the Cooler Master V550 Gold V2, an 80+ Gold rated unit with a semi-modular design that comes in a fetching white colourway. It's well-rated by reviewers and suitable for mid-range systems, and thanks to this limited time deal it's way cheaper than anything else similar on the market!

ThroughLine Games should give that a go, because here they are announcing a new game in the same world as 2019's platforming adventure Forgotton Anne. It's a parallel universe where forgotten items, known as forgotlings come to life and endeavour to be remembered again. This new game, due out in 2024, is actually called Forgotlings, and you play as one called Fig in a similarly actiony platformy adventure in a 2D "semi open-world Metroidvania". Fig is, by the way, an artist's wooden posing doll, and even though he has a head his face is in his torso. I find this greatly distressing and will not stand for it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While out visiting EA Sports to get the lowdown on Madden NFL 24, I had the chance to speak with senior producer Mike Mahar. During our conversation, we veered onto the topic of EA Sports College Football, the revitalization of the long-running college-focused football franchise that ended with NCAA Football 14. In 2021, EA Sports announced the return of its college football franchise, but this time, leaving the NCAA name behind. In a somewhat humorous moment during the interview, when I mentioned "the return of the NCAA Football franchise," Mahar is quick to correct me that it's "College Football." 
We also dove into what it's like to develop an annualized title, along with the decisions that come with that. You can read those portions of the conversation below.

Madden NFL 23 effectively pushed the ball downfield for EA Sports' long-running franchise. Though the implementation of the foundational FieldSense system, which revamped how the gameplay feels on both sides of the ball, was solid, much like any rookie, it was clear it still needed to develop in order to reach its full potential.
Madden NFL 24 carries forward the gameplay improvements from last year while adding some exciting additions to modes like Franchise and the single-player-focused career mode. I traveled to Electronic Arts in Redwood Shores, …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge keeps the ninja party going with the reveal of its Dimension Shellshock DLC. Launching later this year, this upcoming add-on takes the Turtles and their friends through time and space to take on new threats with the help of a familiar ally.
Ronin rabbit Usagi Yojimbo joins the game as a playable character. The samurai warrior has starred in his own self-titled comic series since the ‘80s, but many mainstream fans are likely familiar with him from his numerous crossover appearances in TMNT media over the decades. The trailer shows off Usagi’s formidable prowess with his katana, such as piercing through multiple foes with a single sword thrust. 


Dimension Shellshock also adds an unspecified new game mode, new tracks from composer Tee Lopes, and a fresh set of color schemes for the playable roster. Shredder’s Revenge is also getting another, separate free update that adds another batch of color palette options.
We’ll have to wait to learn more about Dimension Shellshock, but we’re excited to get our hands on it given the exceptional base game. You can read more about our thoughts on TMNT: Shredder’s Revenge by reading our review here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As well as it runs on your average desktop PC, it wasn’t until I began playing Diablo IV on the Steam Deck that its demon-thwacking really clicked for me. Largely because this was my first experience of it with gamepad controls, and using thumbsticks and face buttons to move and toss out spells just feels more... I don't know, direct? Like I’m actually controlling my Necromancer and her boney bodyguards, not just clicking a unit and watching their animations.
It helps that Diablo IV’s Steam Deck performance is surprisingly spry, with fast 45-60fps framerates within reach even when leaving the majority of graphics settings on Ultra quality. Unlike all of the other best Steam Deck games, there’s no native support for its Battle.net launcher, but with some resourcefulness, that needs only be a temporary barrier.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some games adapt to VR more naturally than others. Games that take place primarily in a cockpit, like Elite Dangerous or Euro Truck Simulator 2, need relatively little adjustment to make them enjoyable in VR. They don't require the player to move around much, and their whole shtick about providing an authentic, immersive experience. 


Games that require a lot of fast movement, or require the player to keep track of a lot of different objects, are generally harder to make work through VR Goggles. Hence why Amid Evil VR caught my attention. Shooters are common VR fodder, but they're typically built as VR experiences from the ground up. Amid Evil, on the other hand, is a flatscreen retro shooter designed to be reactive, surreal, and above all, fast. It's a game where you zip around arcane dimensions like a magic missile, splattering weird little armoured guys with enchanted swords and a staff that fires planets. It's a brilliant game, one of the best old-skool shooters to emerge from the genre's revival. But on paper, it's about as VR friendly as Morpheus.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tetris is grand, but it could do with more chainsaws. Thus (presumably) went the thought process of the developers behind Dr. Fetus' Mean Meat Machine, a Super Meat Boy spinoff about lining up colourful meaty blobs while dodging buzzsaws and other grizzly hazards. Think Tetris meets match 4 meets Meat Boy slapstick.

The cardplay never quite reaches the dizzy heights of Spire or Monster Train, but it's far cuter than either of them and still absolutely splendid. Now's a great time to pick it up, too, because its first big update is primarily aimed at clarifying rules to help new players avoid all the painful deaths I suffered through. 
Developers Deadpan Games have released a roadmap, too, revealing a rough plan for what they're working on next.

The moment it happened was captured on stream, and you can watch it for yourself in this clip on Carn's Twitch channel, aptly titled "rip?".
Former Starcraft and Dota pro "cArn" has won the race to hit level 100 on a Diablo 4 Hardcore character, thus earning him a letter from the king and a nap. This is Diablo's permadeath mode, where one death is enough to wipe your progress. He dinged his final ding on his Barbarian in the early hours of June 5th, just five days after the game's early access launch, and he's now been officially confirmed as the first Hardcore centurion. It's a feat that sounds as impressive as it does exhausting.

As the genre has progressed through the generations, sports video games have become increasingly complicated as they add more wrinkles to their team management tools and more depth to their on-the-field action. Super Mega Baseball 4 harkens back to the sports games of the mid-90s, bringing streamlined gameplay and astounding levels of customization while introducing novel concepts. But though the throwback approach is sound in many ways, it does come with some concessions.

They're not sharing how many copies it has sold exactly, but the figures are based on all platforms as of June 5th, the day before the action-RPG's full launch. Blizzard also say that the clickfest has been played for 93 million hours during its early access period.

That might be part of the reason why Lisa has remained a cult classic, even if it has overwhelmingly positive reviews from those who persevered with the punishing, deranged, tragicomic RPG Maker game.

Now it's 2023 and Lisa: The Painful is getting a Definitive Edition re-release, and I'm lucky that I can draw on better known references. It's like Undertale by way of... Uh, thecatamites?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Final Fantasy is one of the longest-running franchises in all of gaming. From its humble 1987 Final Fantasy I beginnings to this year’s upcoming tentpole release, Final Fantasy XVI, the series has, in some way, shape, or form, remained prominent for decades. Part of its success likely comes from how easy it is to get into any new mainline game, which is to say every new entry stands alone (save for the few direct sequels). Final Fantasy II isn’t a direct sequel to Final Fantasy I, just like Final Fantasy VII isn’t one to Final Fantasy VI. 
Terms, mechanics, and sometimes even names might be familiar – there are mainstays like chocobos, magic, Cids, and more – but each new entry features its own cast of characters, world, story, and lore. It’s part of what makes Final Fantasy such a fascina…]]></summary>

It's only recently come out, so we're fresh to death this time - literally, because in it you're trapped in a mansion full of SAW-esque murder-puzzles. I really enjoyed this game, with its low-poly PS1 style, and its vibe of being an early 00s thriller that would probably star e.g. Morgan Freeman hunting down a twisted serial killer played by e.g. Hugh Jackman. But in this metaphor, I am the twisted monster, and I have trapped both you and my colleagues and am forcing you all to play this game I like.

The series' visuals fall somewhere between realism and fantasy, and it’s always fun to see how Square Enix studios leverage more powerful hardware to bring worlds to life.

With each new Final Fantasy, Square Enix has a chance to solidify characters and worlds into the zeitgeist of gaming, like the company has done in the past with Final Fantasy VII’s Cloud Strife, Final Fantasy X’s Zanarkand, and more.

This news comes by way of a new Pikmin 4 trailer released today, which sets up the story of the game and shows off what its customization options look like. As for the story, you play as a rescue explorer sent to a mysterious planet to rescue not one crew but two, each from a separate crashed ship. Before landing, though, you'll need to customize your explorer, and today's trailer indicates you can change their head shape, body shape, face, hair, clothes, and more. 
Check it out for yourself below in the new Pikmin 4 trailer: 


Pikmin 4 hits Switch on July 21, 2023.

The Diablo vibes are strong, it has some neat ideas for the genre, and it has a demo you can try for free. I only wish it drew a little more inspiration from Diablo and a little less from Survivors 'em up conventions.

Diablo IV successfully tempts me to gleefully indulge in sin at every turn. A thrilling hunt for rare loot feeds my insatiable greed and lust for power. The satisfaction of slaughtering thousands of foes, supernatural or otherwise, leaves little room for remorse. Whether taking down the forces of darkness alone or with friends, this is a massive and deeply engrossing action RPG that keeps me coming back for more dozens upon dozens of hours later.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[More fool me for thinking the Amnesia story (a now-complex horror sci-fi epic about Cenobite-esque weirdos who gain immortality by drinking pain-milk extracted from people via torture at the hands of specially engineered torture-monsters) was done with Amnesia: Rebirth. Although, I suppose it actually is, because Rebirth is set in 1937, and Amnesia: The Bunker is effectively a bottle episode taking place during the First World War. And what a bottle episode! You'll spend 4-6 hours being chased around the tunnels of a maze-like bunker, winding up a dim, rubbish torch and reading increasingly unhinged diary notes from the French soldiers who've all been eaten, and boy will you have a great time.

As for what to expect, Capcom says it will share new information about "upcoming releases and future titles."

Capcom also notes in its announcement that this showcase serves as a special digital event to celebrate its 40th anniversary.
The publisher-developer has had a great 2023 so far between releases like Resident Evil 4 Remake and the recently released Street Fighter 6, both of which faired extremely well with both critics and fans. Perhaps this showcase will reveal how Capcom plans to keep that momentum going with upcoming and future releases. Only time will tell. 
In the meantime, read Game Informer's Street Fighter 6 review and then check out our thoughts on Resident Evil 4 Remake.

With Final Fantasy, that’s doubly the case because for me, and I imagine for so many others, its soundtrack is one of its best parts. Be it lo-fi channels, new arrangements, compilations, piano versions, or something else, Final Fantasy music makes its way into many of my playlists.

The same machine retailed for £1629 in March this year, so this is a huge bargain - especially given that this is still hugely a powerful machine for 1440p gaming. The spec even includes a 1TB NVMe SSD and 16GB of DDR5 RAM, so it's a convincing machine from top to bottom.

Starting can seem intimidating with so many different mechanics, items, and leveling systems, which is why I’m here to offer a few tips I wish I had known the first time around (and am now applying on my current second playthrough) that will make your early hours a smoother trek. 
Complete Priority Quests Immediately
Diablo IV has three types of color-coded quests: Story (yellow), Side (blue), and Priority (white). Priority quests are, as the name implies, important because they introduce new game mechanics, such as a new type of store opening up or unlocking a mount. Don’t let these gather dust in your quest log. Otherwise, you’ll be missing…]]></summary>

That's a bit of a faff for sure, but in exchange you do get one of the best and most popular SFF PC cases on the market.

With Final Fantasy, that’s doubly the case because for me, and I imagine for so many others, the music of this series is one of its best parts. Be it lo-fi channels, new arrangements, compilations, piano versions, or something else, Final Fantasy music makes its way into many of my playlists. 
That’s why I was so excited to chat with composer Masayoshi Soken about his score for Final Fantasy XVI. You might recognize his name as he’s also the composer of Final Fantasy XIV. Still, if you don’t, there’s a chance it’s a name you come to remember following the release of FFXVI because after more than three hours of hands-on time with the game in Square Enix’s Tokyo, Japan, o…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If there’s a single upside to the collapsing standards of technical competence among big-budget PC games, it’s that when something like Diablo 4 comes along and simply performs well, there’s an almost pleasant relief to it. Like your bus arriving on time, a minute after watching the previous, late-arriving one flip onto its roof attempting a handbrake turn.  
It’s not perfect, but Diablo IV does run smoothly for the most part (also sorry Google, but I'm going back to Roman numberals), and its system requirements on PC are as likely to involve museum pieces as they are the latest and priciest graphics cards. I’ve put some hours into the early access build and have come up with a best settings guide, but in truth, this will likely just optimise your framerates – Diablo IV’s higher quality settings rarely trouble it, especially at 1080p.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You don't need to play 2020's Final Fantasy VII Remake to enjoy its sequel, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, according to the game's co-director Motuma Toriyama. 
Last week, Square Enix and the official Final Fantasy VII Twitter account began releasing new details about the upcoming sequel, answering one question each day. On day one, we learned Rebirth is "progressing smoothly." Day 2 and Day 3 were less exciting, teasing that players will have a "high degree of freedom, experiencing a myriad of different stories" and that players "will witness a chain of narrative events that lie at the very heart of the Final Fantasy VII story." 
For Day 4, the question is: Do I need to play Final Fantasy VII Remake to enjoy Final Fantasy VII Rebirth? And here's Toriyama's answer: "No – we have made preparations so that players who did not get a chance to play the first game can fully enjoy Final Fantasy VII Rebirth."

June 5, 2023
If I had to guess, Rebirth will feature an introductory cutscene or minimovie that summarizes the events of the first game but only time will tell.
Rebirth is slated to release this winter, although an official release date has not yet been revealed. Considering it's Final Fantasy "7," many are speculating that Square Enix's daily QA will end on Day 7, which would be this Thursday, June 8. That's also the same day Geoff Keighley's Summer Game Fest presentation will air so perhaps we'll be seeing some footage of Rebirth during that, or at least maybe learning when we can play this game.
For more, check out Game Informer's June Summer Game Fest 2023 schedule, and then read our Final Fantasy VII Remake review to find out why you probably should play it before Rebirth. Check out our thoughts on Final Fantasy VII Remake's Episode Intermission DLC after that.

Valve are now required to show Steam users in EU countries a game’s lowest price over the past 30 days, which means sellers can’t display deceptively high discounts by bumping the base price before a sale. Valve made the change in order to comply with the ominously named “Omnibus Directive”, which applies to all online stores.
Steam already enforces limits on manipulating prices around sales, but it’s nice that some people get to have a little extra peace of mind.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft announced last month that it would be holding an Xbox Games Showcase this month, immediately followed by a Starfield Direct focused exclusively on Bethesda Game Studios' upcoming sci-fi RPG. According to the vice president of Xbox games marketing at Microsoft Aaron Greenberg, during the showcase, none of the company's first-party games will be "full CG trailers," as reported by GamesRadar. 
He goes on to explain this means every first-party trailer will be "either in-game footage, in-engine footage, or in-game footage with some cinematic" and each trailer will be labeled appropriately so it's clear what we're looking at. Greenberg tweeted this in response to someone poking fun at showcase tendencies to rely heavily on CGI trailers. 
None of our first party games in the show are full CG trailers. Everything is either in-game footage, in-engine footage, or in-game footage with some cinematics. Each of our trailers will be labeled so it is hopefully clear for our fans.
June 4, 2023
This all started with Greenberg quote-tweeting an Xbox tweet that highlights that the Xbox Games Showcase is live in seven days (well, six days now) on June 11. He quote-tweeted this Xbox tweet to reveal that the showcase is "roughly two hours of non stop games, games, games, games, and Starfield."

Comparatively, Breath of the Wild had 120 (and you can see what finding all of those earned you here), but the reward is surprising, bizarre, and raises some interesting questions about the larger Zelda lore. It's worth noting that there are spoilers below for a late-game unlock.
After skipping the two cutscenes that play at the end of every Shrine for the last approximately 165 hours, the final Shrine shows some unique text and suggests the player visit the Temple of Time for a reward.

With Final Fantasy, that’s doubly the case because for me, and I imagine for so many others, its soundtrack is one of its best parts. Be it lo-fi channels, new arrangements, compilations, piano versions, or something else, Final Fantasy music makes its way into many of my playlists. 
That’s why I was so excited to chat with composer Masayoshi Soken about his score for Final Fantasy XVI. You might recognize his name as he’s also the composer of Final Fantasy XIV. Still, if you don’t, there’s a chance it’s a name you come to remember following the release of FFXVI because after spending more than three hours of hands-on time with the game in Square Enix’s Tokyo, Japan, of…]]></summary>

June 2, 2023
While not much, the update is an exciting one if things are going as well as Kitase claims. As for when we could hear about a launch date, Summer Game Fest is around the corner, and Square Enix is one of the confirmed partners for the event, so there's a small chance Rebirth will make an appearance. 
Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is currently slated to release this winter for PlayStation 5 and picks up after the events of Final Fantasy VII Remake and its Intermission story expansion. Though it follows Cloud and Co.’s journey beyond Midgar, the cinematic reveal trailer makes it tough to know what to expect given Remake's events (other than Cloud and Sephiroth taking a lot of strolls together), so hopefully, we'll be getting another glimpse of the project sooner than later. 
For more, be sure to read our reviews of Final Fantasy VII Remake and the Intermission expansion in the Intergrade version. Square Enix is also gearing up to launch Final Fantasy XVI on June 22, which graces Game Informer's cover this month.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Super Replay returns, and we're checking out Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts! Join us today Friday on Twitch at 2:30 p.m. Central as we kick of the adventure, which will continue each week until we roll credits. We'll also have every episode available the next day on our Game Informer Shows YouTube Channel (or you can watch the videos in the above playlist). 
Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts was released for the Xbox 360 on November 11, 2008. The third (and, so far, final) entry in Rare's beloved platforming series centers on vehicle creation, where players collect and slap together hundreds of parts to assemble their own wacky contraptions to explore. The bevy of possible combinations and emphasis on player choice and creativity was largely unprecedented at the time, paving the way for future games such as the upcoming The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. However, this direction would divide fans due to how much it strays from the traditional Banjo formula. So where will I land on it? Let's find out.
Join me, Marcus Stewart, alongside Kyle Hilliard as we explore one of the Xbox 360's biggest hidden gems to see whether it holds up or falls apart like a poorly constructed doohickey.

But the biggest news for PC players is how surprisingly stable the launch has been. So far. Fingers crossed for the full launch on June 6th. There have been some annoying licensing errors affecting console friends (and a few PC players too), but with the disastrous launch of Diablo III in mind, early access hack n’ slashers can let out a sigh of relief that lightning hasn’t struck twice.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm unsure whether to call Raid On Taihoku a "historical game", since it's an adventure game with enough daftness to feel a bit unlike what that phrase brings to mind. But it's set very thoroughly in Taiwan towards the end of World War II, and though the focus is a young girl's relationship with her family and friends, that context is critical to why I've enjoyed it so much.
Taxonomy aside, then, the important thing is that it's enjoyable. It hasn't hit the emotional highs of the kind of interactive fiction I favour, but for a story with such heavy themes, it provides a relaxing drip feed of mystery reveals and plot thickenings in between low-pressure minigames. It's a good time, without undermining its obvious respect for the people who had to live through this.

With Final Fantasy, that’s doubly the case because for me, and I imagine for so many others, the music of this series is one of its best parts. Be it lo-fi channels, new arrangements, compilations, piano versions, or something else, Final Fantasy music makes its way into many of my playlists. 
That’s why I was so excited to chat with composer Masayoshi Soken about his score for Final Fantasy XVI. You might recognize his name as he’s also the composer of Final Fantasy XIV. Still, if you don’t, there’s a chance it’s a name you come to remember following the release of FFXVI, because after more than three hours of hands-on time with the game in Square Enix’s Tokyo, Japan, …]]></summary>

After playing Catch & Cook’s recently released demo, I’m happy to report that it’s the ideal fishing sim for people who find Dredge’s spooky undercurrents, erm, too spooky. Just a very chill, very good time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[David Brevik, now the president of Skystone Games, did not expect to encounter a doppelganger when he arrived at Chicago’s Consumer Electronic Show in the summer of 1994. He’d come to the tech expo with Condor, a studio he’d co-founded only a few months prior, to show off Justice League: Task Force. A humble fighting game in the vein of Street Fighter, it was given a small demo booth and placed next to another game that featured a cast of superheroes, a strikingly similar visual style and, much to Brevik’s surprise, the very same name.


Without their knowing, Condor were one of two studios hired to develop the DC Comics tie-in: their Sega Mega Drive/Genesis version set to release alongside a SNES title made by another recently formed team, Silicon & Synapse. “We'd never talked to them,” Brevik says. “We'd never interacted with them. We didn't know there was even another version, and then we show up at the booth and they're side by side, and we're like, this is really weird.” They didn't know it yet, but these Justice League sort-of clones were the first paving stones on the road to the Diablo series.

More specifically, Nintendo is releasing the Pastel Pink Joy-Con, Pastel Yellow Joy-Con, Pastel Purple Joy-Con, and Pastel Green Joy-Con on June 30, which is the same day Nintendo's newly announced sequel to 2017's 1-2-Switch hits the console.  The Joy-Con will be sold in standard pairs. The Pastel Pink and Pastel Yellow Joy-Con are packaged together and the Pastel Purple and Pastle Green Joy-Con are packaged together. 
Each set of Joy-Con will include two black Joy-Con wrist straps as well. The Joy-Con are currently showing as sold out on Nintendo's online store. If they were available, you could pre-purchase them now so that you receive them quickly when they start shipping on June 30. Nonetheless, the store makes it clear these Pastel Joy-Con will cost $79.99 for a set, which is in line with other previously released sets of Joy-Con.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo has revealed a sequel to 2017's Switch launch title 1-2-Switch, and it's out this month. 
Titled Everybody 1-2-Switch!, this sequel features team-based games that can be played using Switch console Joy-Con and mobile devices. Nintendo's description of the game says players can split into teams "and see which group can win a certain number of games first," while also noting that many of the games have several variations that change the rules or add extra challenge. 
Everybody 1-2-Switch hits Switch on June 30. Both the physical and digital edition will cost $29.99. 
While this is a surprise official announcement from Nintendo, this isn't the first time we've heard of Everybody 1-2-Switch. Former Game Informer and Fanbyte editor Imran Khan wrote a report while at Fanbyte about this sequel. In that report, Khan spoke to several sources who said the game was complete but unannounced because of how badly it was testing. Nintendo didn't know what to do with the game, with many fearing releasing it in its current state could harm the company's reputation for releasing great games. 
It's unclear what's changed between that report and now – perhaps nothing has changed and Nintendo is using the excitement around The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom to quietly release Everybody 1-2-Switch. Only time will tell, but fortunately, we don't have to wait long because Everybody 1-2-Switch hits Switch on June 30. 
In the meantime, read Game Informer's review of 1-2-Switch.

The Grand Duchy of Rosaria: Bastion of Tradition
A group of small independent provinces in Western Valisthea formed to create this nation long ago, which now draws upon the Drake’s Breath Mothercrystal for aether. It’s where the story of FFXVI begins, and it’s the home of Clive and Joshua Rosfield.

The showcase ended with the reveal of Asgard's Wrath 2. The original Asgard's Wrath is one of VR's biggest, most ambitious (and well-reviewed) games. The sequel picks up where the story of the first game left off while adding all kinds of new mechanics.

During my cover story trip to Tokyo, Japan, to speak to developer Creative Business Unit III, I learned a lot about magic in FFXVI and how it affects Clive’s life and everyone in this world. The special tattoo on Clive’s face is the mark of a Bearer, which indicates he can use magic. This might seem like a great ability, but the nations of Valisthea view Bearers as something other than human. These nations brand their Bearers to show they are enslaved, and nations trade Bearers across borders based on who needs their magical abilities. When Clive receives this branding, h…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Delhi High Court has handed down a broad blocking order that aims to stop piracy before it happens. Following an application by Sony Pictures, more than 100 pirate sites will be preemptively blocked by Indian ISPs to prevent 'Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse' piracy.  The blocking order also applies to domain names that have yet to be registered.

Mostly, we used to store a lot more personal information when you created an account, like email addresses, passwords, etc. As we now use GitHub to handle all that, we can slim down our privacy policy, as we store very little personal information. For the cookie policy, for years now we only use cookies for the authenticated part of our websites and nothing else. OpenTTD’s privacy policy has always been: we want to know as little personal information about you as possible. And although these changes were rolled out years ago, the policies did not reflect that yet. They do now! In short: we removed statements from the policy about information we track, as we haven’t done that for years now. So, what about this automated opt-in survey you are talking about?]]></summary>
