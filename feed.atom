        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I zoom the camera on Alex's momentarily untensed face while he's dozing by the pool, it's not because I'm a creep. When I pursue Ayo and Dija around the garden, keeping their feet and butts in shot as they belittle each other, it's not because I'm a busybody and a lech. And when I pan to the lighthouse piercing the sunset beyond the security spikes, it's not out of any feeling of wonder, or even curiosity about possible escape routes. Please understand: I do not see these people, these objects at all, just the boneless, faceless traces they leave upon my own servitude to the lens.

I will be running, leaping, squatting, and all other manner of athletically maneuvering around the small reality TV set of The Crush House, following four would-be stars as they fight and fall in love. Maybe a bit of both.


My goal, as intrepid producer Jae, is to film it all. But really, I'm not looking for the specific moments you might normally seek out; I'm looking for the right framing, the proper angles, and the perfect shots to appease my audience. It's this aspect that makes The Crush House fascinating, and also a bit frustrating.

How to get Underseaweed in Fields of Mistria


Screenshot by Destructoid


Before you can get some Underseaweed, you’ll need to do a couple of things:



Unlock the Mines and reach floor 20


Break through the Water Seal to get to floor 21



Once you’ve done these two things, you’ll have access to Tide Caverns, which make up floors 21 to 40 of the Mines. Down here, you’ll be able to get Underseaweed, which is a green leafy plant that can be found in the water pools on these levels.

Underseaweed is, first and foremost, an item which should be donated to the Museum as part of the Tide Caverns collection in the Flora Wing. After you’ve done this, you’ll unlock a unique conversational moment with Terithia. 


Secondly, you should keep some Underseaweed as a gift for Valen. While her loved gifts mostly consist of meals which require multiple ingredients, Underseaweed is one of her liked gifts, so is an easy option if you’re trying to get more hearts with her. 


Other than these two primary uses, you can also use Underseaweed in the following recipes, which you’ll unlock upon shipping one of the ingredients included in the recipe:


Meal
Recipe
Cooking time
Cooking level


Tide Salad
1 Tide Lettuce
1 Sea Grapes
1 Underseaweed
1 Cave Kelp

Whether you're spending big on the AWP or managing your money with an MP9, there's a way to win every single round of Counter-Strike. Valve very rarely shakes up the CS2 weapon meta, meaning it's unlikely you'll see too much change in this Tier List in the future.


We've divided our Counter-Strike 2 weapons Tier List into two separate lists: primaries and secondaries. The nature of the game means it's impossible to directly compare the two. Sure, players using an AK-47 or a Desert Eagle can both win a round all by themselves, but those with the sidearm have much less of a chance of actually making it happen.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Riot Games has begun inviting players to participate in its 2XKO Alpha Lab test. If you're interested and want to join the action, here's how you can secure your spot in the test.


How to join the 2XKO Alpha Lab


For now, there are only two methods to join the ongoing 2XKO Alpha Lab test, and unfortunately, both rely on a degree of luck.


Receive an Invitation


The simplest way is to have Riot Games directly invite you. To be considered, though, you must have a Riot Account and sign up for the test on the official 2XKO website, if you haven't already. Make sure your account is using a verified e-mail, otherwise you won't be able to complete the next step.


Image via Riot Games


Once you register for the 2XKO Alpha Lab test, you'll receive an interest survey in the e-mail you used. This survey must be completed to be considered for the test. When you're done, the final step is to wait for Riot to invite you. Should you receive an invite, it will also come in the registered e-mail, providing you the opportunity to choose your preferred platform to participate. 


Recieve a Friend Referral 


The other way you can join the 2XKO test is by friend referral. Some of those who were invited to the 2XKO test also received a referral invite they could use to bring someone else into the test. If one of these players sends you a referral, you can play in the 2XKO Alpha Lab test without a Riot invitation. To be clear, this referral is not a key. It is a literal link you must click on. Only those with a Riot Account can use it to download and play in the test.


Unfortunately, there are no other known methods for joining the 2XKO Alpha Lab test, so you'll probably need to wait for an invite from Riot to get a chance to play it. The Alpha Lab test officially began on August 8 and will run until August 19. Currently, the test is only available on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and Windows PC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Through Valorant Night Market, you can get certain cosmetics or even melee weapons for a discounted price. We have the dates for Episode 9 Act 1, and here's everything you need to know.


Night Market arrives towards the end of every Valorant Act and is the ideal time to get your favorite skins. Although luck plays a major role in what skins you actually get as the drops are Random Number Generator-based (RNG), which means it's totally random.


Next Valorant Night Market date and schedule


The next Valorant Night Market (for Episode 9 Act 1) will commence on August 15 and ends on August 28, 2024. The current Act also ends on the same day.


Historically, they have gone live at 8 PM ET / 2 AM CET / 1 AM BST / 5:30 AM IST, and you can expect it to be the same this time around. This gives you 13 days in total to get your desired skins at a discounted price.




How many skins do you get and can you reroll them?


You get six skins for different weapons in total, and the discounts range from 10% to 49%. As we mentioned earlier, the occurrences are completely random.


You also can't reroll these skins and will remain the same as long as the Market is live for this Act. So, in case you didn't get your desired cosmetics this time, unfortunately, you'll need to wait for the next one to arrive with the hope of better skins.


When was the first Night Market in Valorant?


The first Night Market took place when Episode 1 Act 3 went live, back in December 2020. The one we are getting in Episode 9 Act 1 will be the 23rd iteration of the Night Market in the game.


Now that you know about the next Night Market date, take a look at all the maps you can play in the current competitive rotation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you're wondering whether your PC is powerful enough to take part in the Delta Force: Hawk Ops alpha test, we've listed its minimum and recommended system requirements for you.


Delta Force: Hawk Ops is the latest free-to-play game in the franchise that's having an Alpha test right now that started on August 6, 2024.

Delta Force: Hawk Ops minimum system requirements


Here are the minimum specs you must have to play the game at 1080p30fps:



OS: Windows 10 64-bit


CPU: Intel Core i3-4150 / AMD FX-6300


Memory: 12 GB RAM


GPU/Graphics Card: NVIDIA Geforce GTX 960 / AMD R9 380 / Intel Arc A380


DirectX: Version 12


Storage: 50 GB available space



Delta Force: Hawk Ops recommended specs


If you want to gain all the competitive advantage and want to push to 1080p144fps perhaps, you must have these specs in your system:



OS: Windows 10 64-bit


CPU: Intel Core i5-6500 / AMD Ryzen 5 1500x


Memory: 16 GB RAM


GPU/Graphics Card: NVIDIA Geforce GTX 1060 5G / AMD RX5500 XT / Intel Arc A580


DirectX: Version 12


Storage: 50 GB available space



It goes without saying, but if your PC has better specifications than these, you'll get much better frames at higher resolutions. But looking at the specs provided by the devs, it's not as demanding as some other new games in the market.


These system requirements are listed on the game's Steam page. Since Delta Force: Hawk Ops is still in the alpha phase, the final PC requirements may change upon full release. In case that happens, we'll update this page with the updated info.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you've been trotting around the lands of Mistria, you've likely stumbled across a peculiar insect inside the water. Then, once you try to approach it, the bug hastily runs away to avoid you at all costs. It's tricky to do, but fortunately, a specific technique can guarantee its capture. So, let's dive into how to catch Pond Skater in Fields of Mistria.


How to get Pond Skater in Fields of Mistria


To get Pond Skater in Fields of Mistria, stand by the water's edge and patiently wait for it to come to you. No matter how many times you attempt to approach, the insect will always scuttle away when too near. Therefore, it's best to remain in the same spot, where it will eventually come to you.


Screenshot by Destructoid


The first Pond Skater I caught bounced around like a maniac for a minute or so until it finally got close enough for the capture. Though, it's easier said than done, considering that you must time your bug net swing at the opportune moment. Don't worry if you miss it the first time or even the second time around. The process takes a while to master, but it should eventually work in your favor.


Be aware that the Pond Skater is not present during the Winter season. Luckily, it can be found during all the other seasons, providing you with ample time to practice and prepare for its capture.


There's not a whole lot you can do with the Pond Skater in Fields of Mistria. The insect won't be needed for museum donations, nor does it sell for much profit (only 15 T). However, it does come up as a villager's request for extra Tesserae and gifts.

Coinciding with their locales, the fantastical sport will also have two stadiums based on the magical regions. 


The PlayStation Blog revealed the inclusion of the schools in Quidditch Champions, and this is the first time we're seeing their Quidditch pitches. 


"Of course, a large part of the inspiration came directly from the Goblet of Fire film, which gives us the only visual glimpse into the students and cultures of two of the greatest magical schools in Europe," said creative director Farren Fox. "It left us wondering, how would students from these schools approach Quidditch?"

In a recent interview with Eurogamer, Colantonio talked about the game at some length, revealing that it's set in an alternative 1900s America, and it's using the Wild West backdrop to create something new and essentially unrecognizable: 


"I think the big distinction we're making here is, as far as genre literature goes, this is more like sci-fi literature than it is Wild West or whatever," Colantonio told Eurogamer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Prior to the release of Dawntrail, Final Fantasy XIV implemented a new European probationary Data Center called Shadow. Apparently, this Data Center has served its purpose and is now set to be shut down on August 27. 


The Data Center was introduced in order to ease congestion during the early access period and official launch of Dawntrail and it definitely seems to have done just that. Dawntrail had an incredibly smooth launch with little existence of long queue times, something which was unexpected though very welcome for anyone who was around for the release of Endwalker.


If you’ve been using the Shadow Data Center to play since Dawntrail released, Square Enix are urging you to return back to your home world before August 27, and travel to the Data Center will no longer be possible after August 16.

Don’t worry if you don’t manage to login and return to your home world prior to the removal of Shadow, your character won’t be lost to the Aether. All characters still on any of the following worlds will automatically be returned to their home world once the Data Center is shut down:



Innocence


Pixie


Titania


Tycoon



There will be a short maintenance period on August 27 in order to remove the Shadow Data Center, so the game will be inaccessible for all players during this time. More information about this maintenance will be released closer to the time via the Lodestone.

It's hard to believe that in a little under two months, we'll be experiencing yet another brand-new Zelda title on the Nintendo Switch.

It's the first mainline entry in the franchise to star the titular princess herself, which means the gameplay is going to be significantly different from what you're used to with regular hero Link (or Barry, or Keith, or My Dude, or whatever you've christened him in the past).

Kinggath made a name for themselves when Sim Settlements became a bit of a must-have for any settlement-focused Fallout 4 player.

If you’re a puzzle fan who wants something unique to add to your library, you’re in for a treat. The Lullaby of Life is a sound-based puzzle experience which places you in the blobby shoes of a particle with the ability to create music, exploring the origins of the universe.
At first glance, this game is striking. The aesthetic is vibrant and psychedelic, with seven different chapters, each revolving around a new celestial body and all with their own unique visuals, quirks, and styles of puzzle. Some may require you to work on timing, while others may test your ability to spot hidden paths.

The very first Legend of Zelda LEGO set is just weeks away from release, with the Great Deku Tree 2-in-1 shipping from 1st September. After initially selling out rather quickly, pre-orders are once again available with some new options appearing courtesy of the My Nintendo Store UK & Ireland.
The set – which contains 2,500 pieces and four brand-new Minifigures – can be bought on its own from the My Nintendo Store at its regular retail price of £259.99 / $299.99. However, should you also want a copy of the upcoming The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, which we imagine most Zelda fans probably do, you can order both to take 10% off the Great Deku Tree's cost.

It was a gimmick that made flanking fun again, at least until you died to a distant rifle that was right next to you all along. Its sequel, Splitgate 2 is continuing that gimmick but is also sprucing up the free-to-play arena shooter with a few modern additions, like bum-sliding around corners and big deployable bubbles called "time domes" that slow down your enemies yet speed up your allies. All this and more comes from a gameplay trailer that went up yesterday.

The Italian football league filed a legal complaint in April, claiming that Cloudflare assists and protects pirate services. In a decision handed down this week, the Court of Milan said that it has no legal authority to compel Cloudflare to join the program. The Court also denied Serie A's application for an injunction, for reasons that suggest this battle may not be over.

A merry old time was had, romping through fortress cities like a small herd of crusader buffalo, using the game's absurd jetpack functionality to pancake invading Tyranids, and getting our screens so slathered in gore we couldn't work out who was killing what.
It looks like the gargantuan action game's PvP multiplayer will be even messier. Saber and Focus Home have released an extended trailer that walks you through two major modes - the PvE boss and wave-slaying frenzy of Operations, and the 12-player PvP carnage of Eternal War, which spans a range of match types. The ecstasy of dying for the Emperor aside, both give me frightful flashbacks to the early days of Gears Of War.

You’ll find no traditional boxing rings here, but rather some uniquely designed environments containing portals that swallow anybody knocked into them as well as holes and gaps that send you hurling off the stage only to respawn a moment later.

I first visited the burnt-out ruins of this zombie-infested world a decade ago and I returned to it this week to find a tree-puncher that, despite bearing the pockmarks of early access, retains much of what made it enjoyable back when the survival genre was still wearing its baby onesie. Instead of a review, I figured I'd scribble together a mini starter guide for new (or returning) players. Partly because the game is a proper time sink and it was taking me so long to get through everything. But mostly because I wanted to use that numberful headline. So, here you go: 7 dos and 7 don'ts in 7 Days To (7) Die.

Rainbow Arts' Rendering Ranger: R² is one of the rarest Super Famicom games in existence, but thanks to a partnership between Ziggurat Interactive and Limited Run Games, it's now heading to the Switch and will launch this Winter.
Although initially announced back in 2022, Ziggurat and Limited Run have been fairly quiet on the release since then, but fans can finally get their hands on either a digital version or physical edition later this year, bringing a swift end to the title's long-running scarcity. Originally released in Japan in 1995, only 10,000 copies were made and it quickly became one of the most sought-after console games of all time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was partial to a scrappy little strategy game even before idiot billionaires doomed the planet, and the UK to brain-steaming heat just when you thought we'd escape it this year. Khaligrad is plenty scrappy. Its edges are rough and you have to figure it out yourself, but it's more intuitive than it appears, and easy to operate once you discern some basics. It's scrappy too in that it's, well. It's Stalingrad. Not really: its world is so fictional it's their 15th century. But the invaders are explicitly fascists and the defenders communists embroiled in a long and brutal semi-guerrilla city war with World War 2 technology. Thankfully, it's stripped of any actual fashy or genocidal play-acting beyond each side doing "hail the empire/union" bits as a sign off.
I think that's why, despite its brutal and difficult setting, it's this year's entry in the long tradition of Low-Intensity Strategy Games For When Hot Why Hot Please Stop You Cannot See My Begging Tears For They Evaporate.

Switch eShop - Highlights
SteamWorld Heist II (Thunderful, 8th Aug, $29.99) - Get ready for an epic adventure on the high seas in this sequel to the critically-acclaimed SteamWorld Heist game! All is not well on the waves of the Great Sea – the waters are turning corrosive and eating away at the metal bodies of its robotic denizens. As the captain of a rag-tag crew of Steambots, you’ll lead the way through intense turn-based gunfights, where bullets can ricochet with deadly precision. This time around, there’s a world-map to explore, but be careful – there are no turns to take on the Great Sea, so you’ll have to engage in real-time naval combat against enemy vessels. Also new for this sequel is a job system with in-depth character customization options. With more than 150 weapons, utility items and ship equipment pieces, you can strategically craft your crew to best fit the mission at hand.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[WolfEye's debut game Weird West attempted to pack a little of Dishonored's immersive sim sorcery into a top-down action-RPG. For the studio's next game, co-founders Raphaël Colantonio and Julien Roby are leaning into comparisons with their old endeavours at Arkane more earnestly. The new game - currently untitled and without a release date - is a first-person sci-fi RPG set in an alternate-1900s North America, which ostensibly combines the ingenuity and gadgetry of Dishonored and Prey with a "real RPG" experience redolent of Skyrim and modern-day Fallout.

Reduced score means I can squeeze in another card for more healing. If I can pull my Tarot card, I'll deal damage with each heal, and I’ve already pulled two scratch cards for yet more quick damage. Now, if I can just pull a Jack, I can plonk down the King Of Space And Time for a brutal finisher. That’ll transfer everything on my side over to my opponent’s, forcing a bust for a nice final chunk of hurt and…

We love it when classic NES / Famicom games just seem to prance onto the Switch eShop with no prior warning (though we just happened to miss the warning for this one - cheers, Time Extension). This time, two classic Jaleco games have made their way onto the hybrid console courtesy of publisher City Connection: Pinball Quest and Yokai Club, both developed by Tose.
For those unfamiliar, Jaleco was a prominent force in the days of the Famicom, putting out dozens of console and arcade titles as far back as 1982. It would eventually go on to file bankruptcy in 2014 and its assets subsequently transfered over to City Connection. And now here we are!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Spaceship likers, come hither. Long-running space sim Elite Dangerous has just unloaded a new interstellar vessel into its universe, and she's a beaut. The new Type-8 Transporter is a medium freighter capable of hauling a maximum of 406 tons of cargo. It's got a default jump range of 17.55 light years and two big prongs sticking out of its face like a sci-fi forklift. Cool. The catch is that this ship can only be bought with real money for now, say the developers. This is part of Frontier's new strategy of having paid-for ships in the game. I don't really play Elite Dangerous anymore, so I don't have strong feelings about that. But I do have strong feelings about the space trucker advertisement the developer has put together for the new ship. Come watch it with me.

We had high hopes for Trinity Fusion after playing it at PAX East two years ago, and we’re happy to say, it doesn’t disappoint. The concept is great. A human-made multiverse — made up of Prime, the Overworld, the Underworld, and the Hyperworld — is collapsing, and the only way to fix it is to merge all of the different worlds back together.
You play as three different versions, called counterselves, of a woman named Maya: Altara, Kera, and Naira. Each comes from a different world and has different abilities. Altara has access to unique ranged weapons thanks to her prosthetic arm and a double jump. Naira can wall jump. And Kera can launch enemies into the air and perform air combos. Everything’s better with air combos.

A little while back, Retro Game Books offered up an unofficial Metroid pixel art eBook for absolutely nothing. The deal was valid for an exceptionally limited time, so if you happened to miss out, then you're in luck. As announced by creator Brian Riggsbee on social media, the Pixel Art Metroid eBook is free once again.
You'll need to be pretty quick, though, as the offer, which is to coincide with the 38th anniversary of the original NES title, is only applicable until 9th August at 11:59pm PT (so that's 10th August at 07:59am BST for those in the UK).

Still, I wasn’t entirely convinced. The only thing that’s fun to slide back-and-forth indefinitely is a lounging cat on a smooth kitchen worktop. Still, after messing around with Sliding Hero’s Steam demo, I think this one might have much longer legs than its restrictive-sounding concept suggests. All the better to endlessly slide with.

The day after the cancellation - which Paradox CEO Fredrik Wester implied was down to a “lacking”, unfixable development state - designer Willem Delventhal spoke about his time at the subsequently shuttered Paradox Tectonic. He claimed the team spent a month “in purgatory” prior to being told of the game’s cancelation and studio shuttering two weeks before launch, despite being told by higher-ups that work was “exceeding expectations.”
We’ve now got another look at a game we’ll likely never get, thanks to a thread by Twxbbly user SimMattically collating unseen screenshots from portfolios by several artists who worked on Life By You.

It's both a praiseworthy endeavour and an interesting breakdown of the voice-actor's trade.

The AMD Ryzen 9000 series starting with the Ryzen 5 9600X and Ryzen 7 9700X launching tomorrow are some truly great desktop processors. The generational uplift is very compelling, even in single-threaded Linux workloads shooting ahead of Intel's 14th Gen Core competition, across nearly 400 benchmarks these new Zen 5 desktop CPUs impress, and these new Zen 5 desktop processors are priced competitively. I was already loving the Ryzen 7000 series performance on Linux with its AVX-512 implementation and performing so well across hundreds of different Linux workloads but now with the AMD Ryzen 9000 series, AMD is hitting it out of the ball park. That paired with the issues Intel is currently experiencing for the Intel Core 13th/14th Gen CPUs and the ~400 benchmark results makes this a home run for AMD on the desktop side with only some minor Linux caveats.]]></summary>

This is not the murmuring of some poor sod on a nineteen-hour Dota 2 binge who’s started thinking that the crumbs in his keyboard resemble a viable snack, but a bold new reality, one I recently found myself staring down during a trip to Asda. The supermarket chain – third biggest in the UK by turnover and purveyors of ill-fitting clothes and surprisingly good doughnuts alike – has added light-up gaming mice, keyboards, and headsets to its mountain of own-brand wares.
Asda being what it is (Americans, if you’re unfamiliar, think Walmart with less gun violence), it’s all dirt cheap as well. £17 for a full-size keyboard. £16 for an FPS mouse. Overwhelmed with curiosity, I ended up taking home a complete starter set (keeb, different mouse, headset, and mousemat) for £45, or about a third of the price of the Logitech G515 Lightspeed TKL that I’d shortly kick off my desk. Could this be a new frontier in affordable PC hardware, bringing tech to the masses in a way no specialist retailer ever could, or should supermarkets stick to cereal and meal deals? Surely the Asda Tech (real name) 4-in-1 Gaming Kit would have the answers.

Since then the country has blocked over 300 pirate domains following requests from various broadcasters.

Pay TV revenues were less affected than one might expect.

I'm pretty sure not having eight gigs of RAM is heretical, but never fear, you can probably compensate by taking a leaf from the God-Emperor's book and arrange for a host of dying psykers to pour their brain energy into your motherboard.
All of which is to say that Focus Home have released the system requirements for huge-shouldered action game Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2. Find them proudly emblazoned across the header image above, and written out for easier copy-pasting in the blockquote, below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As the wait lengthens for Hollow Knight: Silksong, other Soulsy creature features are scurrying to fill the breach. We had Deviator last week - now, it's time for a bumper helping of the heebie-jeebies in the shape of Perennial Order. The title makes it sound like an eBay delivery of potted geraniums. The game festering beneath is actually a "plant horror" boss rusher with twin stick melee controls, unlockable "Instinct" abilities and one-hit deaths.
In a gift to headline writers everywhere, the developers, four-person Gardenfiend Games, are calling it "Hollow Knight meets Titan Souls", and who am I to deny them? It's got one of those "painterly" art styles, too, though other words come to mind, such as "rotted" and "unhallowed" and "manky". It's out on 6th September. Find a trailer nested below this paragraph like a venus flytrap poised to clamp around your fingers.

Because today developers Paradox revealed the ins and outs of another feature from the DLC that is way more exciting than some fusty old Greeks. It's called "landless adventurers" and it'll let you play as disgraced dirtbag travelling the world in a sort of medieval gig economy. You'll be making camp, gathering followers, taking random jobs from local rulers, and catching infectious diseases as you try to travel safely through war-torn regions. It sounds amazing.

My feelings about the series have settled back from self-righteous fury over its Pentagon-sponsored war-fellating to a quieter, regretful sense that there have maybe been enough Call Of Duty games now, and that it would be nice if we could fill that infamous late October/early November release slot with, I don't know, games about witches instead, or maybe just turn it into a public holiday and spend the week lying on a mattress regarding the ceiling. Still: I've skinned and filleted enough COD in my time to know that Black Ops 6's new "omnimovement" system is going to ruffle as many feathers as it smooths. The short version is that it turns you into Max Payne.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In his Vampire Survivors review, Matt Cox described the game as something he could play with "one hand in a packet of crisps". I think about this quite often, actually, as someone whose largely offline friends (or Fortnite/FIFA pals) ask me to recommend them a game that's good or interesting. Show them something popular like Elden Ring and, despite its grandeur, it might prove too much in all facets. But Vampire Survivors? It's an easy sell: simple, digestible, ridiculous value.
All of this is to say, One BTN Bosses is from the same school of the easy sell. You can fight bosses with one hand in a packet of pickled onion Space Raiders, after all.

You get your bearings, and you soon meet up with another, only slightly irritating, small child. His name is Kimothy, which sounds like something you’d only say as a joke to annoy friends named Kim, and then only once because it would be stupid to say it again. It’s fine! Leaves flutter, rays of sun cavort through trees, and the music is utterly gorgeous. The game opens on twinkly piano and mournful strings, infused with a good dose of stirring JRPG whimsy, and soon transforms into whatever the genre of music is called that makes you want to immediately go on a massive adventure. Potion-punk. Slime-swing. Limit breakcore etc.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Is early adoption a chump’s game? I dunno about that, though between the Asus ROG Ally X and the Steam Deck OLED, those who stayed their hand on their earlier handheld gaming PC counterparts do have a couple of quality second-genners to choose from. Valve’s effort manages to wring multiple performance, design, and battery life improvements out of its new display, while the ROG Ally X makes similar upgrades with a bigger-yet-better take on the original ROG Ally.
The only thing to do, clearly, is make them fight. It’s probably in the Irish Code Duello or something: "Should one portable games box impugn another’s honour by releasing shortly after it, satisfaction must be claimed through a comparison article." My hands are bound here, folks, though if you yourself have been playing the waiting game on a handheld purchase, perhaps this little head-to-head can help you pick the right one.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cinematic platformer Bionic Bay opens on a scene of a very large egg doing very bad things - easily my third favourite genre of speculative fiction. You awake to a world of tree trunks that twist like viscera and corroded contraptions powered by luminous goop that’s stored in the balls, uh, big glass orbs. A beam of light soon fills your character with newfound vigour, which is a nice moment of triumph in what otherwise feels like a deeply oppressive rust pit, all unsteady platforms and jagged pipes.
It doesn’t take long before you start spotting examples of the reason Bionic Bay went viral earlier this week. Above your head hangs a painstakingly detailed mass of vents and cables, looming lifelike with dust and shadow and history. I stood and stared because I’d seen how the sausage was made, but I like to think I would have lingered longer than usual anyway. It really is just that impressive.

As such, I think I'm the nearest thing RPS has to a Fate "expert". Join me for a brief and sporadically informed tour of a universe that has Shaped The Culture like few others.

When the press got wind of it, the major countered that "everyone was happy", which is hard to argue with, especially since there are no official cinemas nearby.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the neat things about Norland's fantasy medievalism is that specialist knowledge is tied to characters. So if there's only one person in your village who knows how to brew tastier beer, and they die after being freakishly savaged by a passing wolf (it happens), suddenly your village will have no artisanal lager master. The results may be devastating. Luckily, you can share knowledge in a number of ways - by copying books, or having "wise conversations". The exception to this is child characters, whose pea-sized brains can't learn specialist knowledge, only soaking up basic attributes like "manners" from the teachers you assign to them. Well, until now. The developers for the Rimworld-meets-Crusader Kings catastrophe simulator have made kids a little smarter. They'll now learn more important things from their adult teachers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Flippin’ heck, what a journey it’s been for Baldur's Gate 3, eh? It seems just yesterday I was getting very jealous at Matthew Castle (RPS in peace) for getting to preview the sequel to my beloved Shadows Of Amn. Fast forward several turns, Larian’s RPG banger is officially one year old since release, and there’s now a much higher chance that strangers at pubs will understand why my failed romance with Jaheira as a youth was such a deeply heartbreaking experience. Baldur’s Gate 3 itself looks to be done and dusted following the upcoming patch, but Larian now seem to be gearing up for their next charm offensive with a new “community focused” YouTube channel, as well as further teasing their two games currently in development.

Have Sony's goons found me at last, after swearing vengeance for that 8/10 I handed God Of War 3 as a cub reporter? Does the motion detector on the light over the apartment block door need fixing? There is no time to enquire and certainly no time to flee, for there are video games we must discuss.

Friend, here is what driving games have taught me: traffic lights are there for regional flavour; drifting is the same thing as cornering; other cars exist to serve as bumper cushions when overshooting a turn. Certainly, nobody wants a guy whose ideas about automobiles come from 2018's Wreckfest to be involved in the school run. On which note: THQ Nordic have just announced Wreckfest 2 - a fresh helping of destruction derby with fancified visuals and newly animate drivers who flinch and gesticulate when other drivers smash into them. Witness the carnage in the announcement trailer below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's a hell of a thing to showcase a remake weeks after kiboshing the developers of the original game. In early July, Gothic creators Piranha Bytes were reportedly shuttered as part of Embracer Group's mad race to trim costs, following their decade-long acquisition binge. Watching THQ Nordic's new Gothic Remake trailer, below, feels a little like watching a vivisectionist parade about in somebody else's skin. Still, the remake's developers Alkimia Interactive aren't to blame for Embracer's fuck-ups, and I am selfishly happy to see Gothic return as an Unreal Engine 5 production - even if I didn't play the original back in 2001.


Sin did play the original game, and in her 2016 retrospective, she paints an absorbing picture of a dark fantasy "microsociety" in which every community "has a reason to exist, a means of providing for itself, a social order, and a long term goal". It's a setup that reminds me of my beloved Roadwarden, even as the sight of grumpy lizards slinking through undergrowth has me silently mouthing "fus roh dah".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Titan Quest 2! Now there's a name you can set your watch by. No colons, no bespoke jargon, no tortuous subtitles like "Gaia's B.O.U.N.T.Y." or "Hyperion's Wild Rumpus" - just the steadying prospect of a titanic quest that, who knows, may involve actual titans. The action-RPG beneath the moniker appears similarly straightforward: it's about following a plot thread through a mythological world in top-down view, smashing Ancient Greek giga-crabs and the like to obtain shinier, pointier varieties of gear. I'm sure I don't need to tell you that there's an endgame in which you farm monsters for crafting materials.


Like Pandora opening her box, but without the accompanying tidal wave of sickness, curses and death, THQ Nordic have released a new trailer that talks you though all of this in detail. Here it is...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The first World Of Goo was a cheerful parade of goopy engineering with a sense of never-ending novelty (well, never-ending for about four hours). Every level would introduce a new goo type or a twist on the basic bridge-building puzzle that challenged you to get a gaggle of gurgling balls to the nearest pipe. World Of Goo 2 pursues that sense of novelty with just as much twitchy eagerness as its predecessor, throwing new toys and goos at the player in an effort to keep you on your sludge-coated toes. That pursuit doesn't always result in pleasing new levels, though. There is a "hit and miss" feeling to things this time around. But those hits are hits. For anyone who has spent the last 16 years yearning for more sticky structure-building: I hope you like comically unpredictable fluids.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["Again, but better" has become the maxim of post-Steam Deck portable PCs. Or, to be more specific, post-Steam Deck OLED ones. Now that Valve have shown it’s possible to quickly turn around an upgraded handheld without enraging owners of the original, Lenovo have hinted at a new Legion Go, MSI have revealed an improved Claw, and Asus have released this here ROG Ally X. A ROG Ally, again – but better? Yes, it is, in almost every way except the speed at which it’ll plunge you into financial destitution.

Don’t get me wrong, I’m a big fan of those perpetually disgruntled ghosts and charming goofskulls, but I might not be writing about the platform game at all if I hadn’t seen it in motion, where the vision comes together a lot more. The Cuphead influence runneth so overly that it feels trite to even point it out, and I do think maybe opting for different music would have served it far better in this case, but you can’t deny that Ghosts n’ Goblins lance throw.

Current developers Kokku will use the additional time "to improve both the game's performance and its content". Additionally, Paradox are removing the option to preorder the game until they have a "robust" release timeline. Existing preorders on all platforms will be refunded, and all preorder-exclusive items will be added into the base game.

Now Mountaintop Studios, a new studio whose ranks include ex-Bungie and Respawn devs, have chucked themselves into the tactical FPS gauntlet with Spectre Divide. Made with input from former CS pro and streamer Shroud, it looks a bit like a mix of CS and Valorant, but has a big gimmick that sets it apart from the two: you can swap between two bodies. I… am cautiously optimistic? I think?

According to Totilo, Bungie leadership "overstated their studio’s financial prospects to Sony" after the latter bought Bungie in 2022 for $3.6 billion. The latest cuts were necessary to prevent continued losses, says the report, after Bungie missed Sony’s targets following the release of last year’s Lightfall.

On the other, it makes me think of side-scrolling Soulslikes (Scroulslikes?) such as Blasphemous and the frantic worldbuilding of Rick & Morty.

Activision have released it as a 4GB open-source project that can be explored in a 3D model-viewing tool. That's cool.

“A British transport joke!” I said to myself, marinating in the sufficient amount of crown-mandated mild amusement. “Our organ-floggingly expensive yet vital public services are crap!” I was having a good time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In 2015, Kim Dotcom filed 52 requests with New Zealand government departments to urgently disclose information to assist his case. After most of the requests were transferred to the Attorney General's office, Dotcom demanded damages for breaching his privacy. After nine years of courts handing down decisions and Dotcom filing appeal after appeal, the Court of Appeal has now denied Dotcom's request for special leave to appeal the High Court's dismissal of another appeal, against a Human Rights Tribunal's decision not to award damages.

Bungie are also transferring a further 155 roles to parent company Sony Interactive Entertainment, and are spinning out an untitled incubation project - an "action game set in a brand-new science-fantasy universe" - to form a new PlayStation studio.

The developers have just released a nine-minute explainer video, which teems with scenes of gimp suits, winged vans, rocket-propelled pinkies, vicious card battles against small excited dogs, and a surprisingly in-depth management component. There are bits that make me think of Batman: Arkham City, and bits that make me think of Pathologic, and bits that make me think of Yakuza - a combination fit to burst the brain. Quick, before your brain bursts, watch the video for yourself below.

Kletka isn't helping: created by in404, it's a horror scavenging game reminiscent of Lethal Company and Golden Light, in which you ponderously plummet through the layers of an "endless" post-Soviet Gigastructure, scrounging fuel, parts and provender for an elevator that wants to eat you.

This has less to do with GTA in itself, Vermeij says, than with the fact that changes in computing capacity today simply aren't as dramatic as in the days of the very first PlayStation. It's becoming rare, he suggests, that you see a "jump" akin to GTA going 3D.

We're talking about new guild assignments, new gadgets, better world generation, a new world, new monsters. The list is enormous and designed expressly around improved replayability - take that, Las Vegas Dome.

Additional screenshots suggest this frog later acquires wings. Like a captive Generation Game host, I am helpless but to shout out more incredible sights as they flutter past on the conveyor belt of pure flippin' videogame before me. It’s got dance parties with horrible gorilla aliens. It’s got building, namely the Statue Of Liberty out of goop, just as George Washington’s goop clone intended. It’s also got just sitting on a bench, enjoying some lovely serene space scenery.  Feast your famished face on the trailer.

Specifically, laidback intercity services with nobody else in the quiet car and certainly, none of those screeching smaller bipeds, or "children" as they are scientifically known. That idyll is now lost to me thanks to Covid: I have vulnerable family members and continue to be careful about social distancing. As such I spend most train journeys these days lurking between carriages, trolling the door sensors and scowling furiously at anybody who visits the loo. But now, thanks to the obscene magic of video games, I can get my fill of authorial locomotivation once again.

With work on No More Room In Hell 2 well underway though, Torn Banner have decided to call it on Chiv 2, which they now consider “feature complete.”

Original story:
Earlier this month it was reported that Skibidi Toilet, the YouTube phenomenon, may be heading to film and television via director Michael Bay. Now Invisible Narratives, a production company co-owned by Bay, has apparently sent a DMCA takedown notice to Garry Newman, citing the large number of Skibidi Toilet games and assets advertised within Garry's Mod.

Skibidi Toilet uses assets derived from Half-Life 2, however, and owes a lot to the Garry's Mod machinima scene. And the animation's original creator, best known as DaFuqBoom, is claiming innocence over the DMCA.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There’s a new version of AMD Fluid Motion Frames (AFMF) available to try, and good news for Radeon GPU owners: it is drastically, almost comically better than the original version. Whereas AMD’s first take on driver-level frame generation – the same kind of framerate-roiding image generation trickery that FSR 3 and DLSS 3 are based around – came yoked to a barrel of jittering, stuttering, and visual artefacting issues, Fluid Motion Frames 2 is as smooth and you’d like. Without compromising on the ability to deploy it in theoretically any DirectX 11- or 12-based game, too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[British comedy is too often defined by its relationship to America: either as merely irony and sarcasm, which we're told Americans don't understand, or as a sprightly ideas factory for works such as The Office, which Americans can bless by re-making at scale.

Peel back the curtains of American cultural hegemony however and you may find the true pulsing core of British comedy that lies beneath: innuendo. No American network is in a bidding war to import Vic and Bob or remake Bottom, and Carry On and Benny Hill are assumed to be anachronisms in our modern times, but Thank Goodness You're Here! enters the conversation with a nudge and a wink. It's a cheeky 2-3 hour adventure through a small northern town, and it's here to educate the entire world of our nation's obsession with sausages and bare bottoms.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Edwin spotted this game called Beta Decay that's not got a release date yet or anything, but looks very cool. It's being developed by Rotoscope Studios and it's a low-poly, 90s-inspired mix of dystopian RPG, survival, third and first-person shooter, with some roguelike bits slapped in there, as well. Whew, that's a lot. Potentially too much. But hey, I am here for something ambitious and interesting, of which it ticks both boxes.

Well, funnel all that anticipation into your mouse-clicking finger, because developers Square Enix have just put up a playable demo of the bright JRPG on Steam. I'm not sure how much the demo offers, as we're only told it includes "a section of the story, battles and exploration." But that's better than nothing, and with a full month before release, you have plenty of time to scope it out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In Cleanfall you essentially play a Roomba that is trying to reverse the apocalypse because the apocalypse is messy. A Roomba capable of tunnelling through miles of procedurally generated, monster-infested crust so as to reorganise the Earth's core and bring about its ultimate objective - a sparkling living room. I enjoy the militant reductiveness of this character motivation. There are sprawling underground ecosystems to discover, yes, weird plants to harvest, fractious clumps of tentacles to appraise, avoid or slaughter. But all of these things are contemptible details to be swept up and bagged and thrown in the dumpster.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Overwatch 2 director Aaron Keller has posted a lengthy blog on Steam about the transition from 6v6 player matches in the first Overwatch to 5v5 in the poorly received free-to-play sequel. It's a juicy read for armchair designers and lapsed Overwatchers like myself, packing in analysis of class roles and the shift from the free choice of heroes to single hero picks and enforced team compositions.
In broad strokes, Keller summarises how the Overwatch experience has drifted away from "player freedom and creativity in order to create a more balanced, consistent and competitive experience for players". It's possible, however, that Overwatch 2 will swing back in the other direction, as Blizzard are now "exploring how we can test different forms of 6v6 in the game to gauge the results", with a view to restoring some of the joyful chaos that saw entire teams of Reinhardts charging the objective in formation.

They often feel like a casualty of Marvel movie bloat. Mortal Kombat 1 was marketed as a "reboot", for example, but is really just a continuation of previous nonsense, with developers NetherRealm saying "I don't know, stick a multiverse in it." Yet from that multiverse now arrives another bad guy, bringing new story chapters for the fighting game's first big expansion, as well as extra characters like the liquid metal murderer from Terminator 2, a Conan of the barbarian persuasion, and the masked killer of the Scream movies.
