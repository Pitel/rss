During the official stage event at Jump Festa 2025, it was revealed that the anime's highly anticipated Hell's Paradise  Season 2 is set to premiere in January 2026. In addition, Crunchyroll will reportedly stream the season as it airs.


The announcement came with the new season's teaser trailer, which showed Sagiri and her companions venturing further into the enigmatic and dangerous island of Shinsenkyo. Among the highlights was the introduction of Yamada Asaemon Shugen, a new executioner making his landing on the island.




Furthermore, Director Kaori Makita, who helmed the critically acclaimed first season, shared her enthusiasm and thoughts on continuing the story:

January 2025 anniversaries


January celebrates the anniversaries of one of the first 3D fighting games Battle Arena Toshinden, and a story-focused favorite from the PS3 era, Life is Strange, which has since spawned many sequels.

Now, it's important to note that these might not all be titles that released in 2024; they're just ones that the guys happened to have played over the last 12 months.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The DAN DA DAN anime has captured the hearts of fans with its unique blend of supernatural elements, humor, and thrilling action. But while the first season was an absolute banger, it isn't without flaws. After all, it ended its first season in a terrible cliffhanger, leaving fans in a state of disarray. That may be an exaggeration... or maybe not.


Fortunately, the wait won't be that long. The second season is already slated to air in July 2025. But for those who can't wait, there's always the option of reading the manga. Naturally, that begs the question of where the DAN DA DAN Season 1 ends in the manga. The specific scene wherein Jiji and Okarun found the mysterious room would be the start of Chapter 34, so anime fans may simply start reading from there.


The Dandadan manga can be read for free through MANGA Plus or VIZ.

DAN DA DAN's Cursed House Arc


Season 1 does a good job setting up the Cursed House Arc. The story starts with Jiji approaching Seiko to help exorcise his house. However since Seiko's power is only limited to her territory, she sent Momo to do the deed instead. While she couldn't find powerful spirit energy at first, things became disastrous after Okarun and Jiji discovered the mysterious room.


Immediately after their discovery, the house was visited by Jiji's landlord, the Kito family. Coincidentally, the group of creepy perverts haunting Momo in the hot spring also came from the same clan. They proceeded to harass Jiji and Okarun, intending to offer them alongside Momo to the so-called Tsuchinoko. 


While the Tsuchinoko technically haunted the house, the being Jiji kept seeing would be another entity. Interestingly, it would be both a blessing and a curse.

Getting the Cuddly Fuzzlefin skin for Jeff the Land Shark is very easy. Follow these steps to snag it:



Step 1: Open the Marvel Rivals and log into your account. 


Step 2: Once you have opened the game, head over to the home page and enter the Winter Celebration event page. 


Step 3: Now, you will see an option to decorate the tree. To do that, you have to earn Golden Frost tokens. However, it can only be earned by playing the limited-time mode called "Jeff's Winter Splash Festival." The more you play this mode, the more you will earn the tokens.


Step 4: Once you have enough tokens, you can use them to complete five different decorations: Snowman, Giftbox, Ribbon, Tree, and Festival Stage. Each of these decorations will cost you two Golden Frost tokens, but here’s the good part—each decoration earns you 100 points.


Step 5: Your goal is to earn 500 points, which will unlock the Cuddly Fuzzlefin skin for Jeff the Land Shark. Once you have completed all five decorations, you should have the 500 points needed to get the skin.



What is the end date of Jeff the Land Shark Cuddly Fuzzlefin skin in Marvel Rivals?


Cuddle Fuzzelfin Skin for Jeff the Land Shark will be available throughout the Winter Celebration event. However, this event will run till January 8, 2025, so you have plenty of time to gather tokens and unlock the skin.

Actually, that's a bit of an understatement: B42 is so substantial that it seems like a fever dream at times, and that's without even discussing the new towns added to the map.


To get the obvious caveat out of the way, yes, this is the "Unstable" branch of the game I'm talking about. What this means is that you shouldn't set up for a long-term playthrough anytime soon because The Indie Stone is pushing out hotfixes at a brisk pace, and there's a propensity for your save-game to break. Yet, I'm still not about to return to the stable and mod-rich B41 of Project Zomboid anytime soon, possibly ever. That's how good this new version is, and the new towns are a huge part of the equation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Northern Expedition event is now live in Fisch, and you can access a new region in the form of the Northern Summit Island.


This new region is one of the many additions that are part of the recent update. Based on my understanding, reaching the new region is pretty easy even if you're a beginner, and there's a cool mechanic involved as well. To reach the new location, however, there are certain prerequisites.


How to get to the Northern Summit Island in Fisch


Reaching the new location requires you to have a boat, so you'll need to reach at least Level 5 and have the credits to get a boat. The closest spot to the portal is Sunstone Island, and you'll need to travel straight after taking a right turn.


It's pretty easy to follow since a pointer will direct you to where the portal is located. Just approach it and go through the gate. Doing so will take you to a completely new area, where the only location available is the Northern Summit. The new location is quite different in terms of design aesthetics, with most of the land being covered by snow.




There are plenty of ladders you'll find on this map, which will allow you to traverse the cliffs with ease. There are different Oxygen tanks you can get in this region, and they will allow you to reach the other areas of the Northern Expedition Island.


A new location also means new fish, and there are 36 new varieties to find based on the official patch notes. We will have a detailed guide out when we have more ideas about how to find them and complete the new bestiaries.

Few video games can lay claim to having such enormous influence on both gamers and the industry at large as Tetris. All who played Alexey Pajitnov's block-falling puzzler fell for its elegant design and Nintendo in particular harnessed its addictiveness to great effect as a pack-in title that made 'Game Boy' an essential purchase and a household name.
But what's the best Tetris game? Is the Game Boy iteration still the most popular decades later? We've compiled this definitive ranking of Tetris games to answer just that question, so you can dump the garbage and focus on clearing lines in the best possible way.

        <link href="https://www.destructoid.com/warframe-1999-whos-on-point-which-character-should-you-choose/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=warframe-1999-whos-on-point-which-character-should-you-choose"/>
        <updated>2024-12-20T22:59:13.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the Warframe 1999 quest, there comes a time when you will have to decide who’s on point. Right before the buildup to the initial end of the quest, you’ll control someone other than Arthur, but who will it be?


Who should you pick during the “Who’s on point” choice in Warframe 1999?


In this scenario, you’ll choose between Arthur, Aoi, Amir, and Lettie. Each of them will have their own loadouts and passive dialogue. The other two, Quincy and Eleanor, are absent in this part due to other things that happened (trying to avoid spoilers).


With the four choices, here is the loadout for each:


Arthur



Ax-52 


Vesper 77


Skana



Aoi



Burston


Protokol Hira


Bo



Amir



Amprex


Protokol Vesek


Lacera



Lettie



Latron


Protokol 95


Dual Kamas



This part of the quest can be beaten with any of the characters chosen. It all really boils down to which loadout you like best. 


Screenshot by Destructoid


Personally, I found Amir to be the “best” choice here just because his loadout has the most AoE potential. You’ll be facing a swarm of Techrot enemies, and his Amprex alone can mow down these enemies with ease. Not to mention, his Lacera has the best DPS, attack pattern, and reach compared to all the other Hex members’ melee weapons. 


His ability kit is Volt’s, too, so he can speed things up and decimate crowds with his Discharge ability. Honestly, if you want to get through the quest faster to get to the bounty stuff, just pick Amir.


Is there a difference on who’s on point?


There is no difference or loss in who you pick for this particular part of the quest. In true Warframe fashion, the dialogue and some things will be spiritually different, but the outcome will always be the same. 


In the end, once you get past the Techrot section, you’ll eventually get to the Legacyte part of the quest, where you’ll play as Eleanor.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Snoop Dogg has been dominating the Fortnite space for a hot minute, being part of two major events. He’s now back for the Winterfest event, adding much-needed holiday joy. So, if you want to get your hands on a free Snoop Dogg skin in Fortnite, check below.


How to get the free Snoop Dogg skin in Fortnite


To get the free Snoop Dogg skin in Fortnite, you have to open the gifts in the Winterfest Lodge area from the main menu. One of the gifts will contain the Santa Dogg outfit, which is Snoop Dogg dressed up in a Santa outfit.


Unfortunately, the skin is not available at this time. There are other gifts you can open to get free holiday-themed items usable in the Battle Royale and other modes.


This skin is separate from all the other skins Snoop Dogg has had so far. Those include the ones from the Music Pass and other collab skins previously made available in the market. Those are not included in the free Christmas event.

Since the event runs until January 7, 2025, he will be made available sometime before this concludes. Just log in every day and open the gifts left for you here.


Eventually, there will be more gifts. As time progresses, more will show up, but have not been fully added into the game just yet. You don’t even need to actively play to be eligible to open these either.


These are all pre-determined gifts from various NPCs in the game. Even that big Yulejacket gift on the left is pre-determined to be the other free skin.


We’ll be sure to let you know when Snoop’s gift is made available. For now, enjoy the other freebies and festivities during the event.

Before you even think about romance, you'll need to play the 1999 quest, decide who you want to date, and understand the new seasonal system. Beyond that, here's how to start dating ASAP.

The Happy Holidays Hauler spawns in the heart of Los Santos at Legion Square. It spawns more when you join a Public Session, as solo ones take up to an hour for it to make an appearance. The process works similarily to the Gooch, another feature added to the game's winter update. You'll receive a notification of its arrival, marked with a blue truck icon on the map. Those who haven't seen this prompt after a short period should join another server for a quick refresh.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Fortnite Winterfest 2024 began as scheduled on December 20, and it brings a whole bunch of rewards for the players, including the Yulejacket skin.


The festive season has finally arrived, and players can finally open the colorful gifts that can be found at the Cabin. It was already confirmed that the gifting season will be back once again, and the Yulejacket skin is certainly the top draw in my books. As things stand, this skin might test your patience if you want to get it on day one of the fest.


How to find the Yulejacket skin in Fortnite


The Yulejacket skin is part of the Winterfest 2024 offerings, so you won't have to spend any resources. It's situated in one of the many colored boxes that can be found at the Cabin. You can access the location from the main menu itself (look for the special icon at the top of your home screen).


It was already rumored there would be 14 different gifts, and that appears to be the case once again. If you believe in rumors, the Yulejacket skin is in the Green box with the Red Bow box (one of the two largest boxes).


Image via Destructoid


It appears that if you try to open the box on the very first day, you can't. Once you pick it, you will see that the box is saved for the last day. In all likelihood, this is indeed the box from where you might get the Yulejacket skin.


All the other boxes I picked can be immediately opened, which makes it clearer about where the skin is. In fact, Yulejacket is the only skin that's part of the Fortnite Winterfest 2024 offerings, which makes sense for Epic to lock it behind a type of advent calendar.


Nevertheless, there are still some really fun rewards you can unlock in the meantime. You can open one box daily, and they will feature random rewards ranging from Pickaxe to Emotes. Make sure to log in to the game every day so that you can unbox a present in the Cabin every day.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Gooch is back in GTA 5 Online right ahead of Christmas, and you can spawn it to win an exclusive rare outfit to add to your collection.


In many ways, Rockstar has reintroduced older quests once again, which serves as a great chance for those who missed it last year. The snowman locations, for example, remain the same, and so does the Gooch. It's Rockstar's take on the nefarious Grinch, and you'll have to perform certain tasks to make it spawn.


How to find the Gooch in GTA 5 Online


The process of spawning the Gooch in GTA 5 Online remains the same. The location and timing of its spawn are random, but there are certain prerequisites you'll have to complete. You'll need to spend at least 48 real-time minutes in a single play session with two or more players.


You'll also need to have enough money and snacks on your in-game character because the Grooch has its eyes on that stuff. If you have them and spend the required time, the creature will spawn randomly and loot your resources. While the timing will be random, there will be a green smoke before your character gets knocked out.




The objective now will be to get back what's been looted from you. Open your mini-map, and you'll find the Gooch's location marked as a red dot. You'll have to pursue and kill it, but doing so is entirely up to you. You can engage with it directly and use a weapon you have or just run it over with a vehicle.


Once you complete the task, you'll get back all the items that were stolen from you. Additionally, you'll also get the Gooch mask and full outfit. The rare costume will be a great addition to your inventory, but it will also be available for a limited time.

With the map and NPC locations changing with Winterfest, he can be tricky to find. Here is how to find Sgt. Winter in the Winterfest event in Fortnite and complete the quest.


Screenshot by Destructoid


Where to find Sgt. Winter in Fortnite Winterfest event


You can find Sgt. Winter standing around at the crashed airplane located in the snowy mountains just south of the center of the map. If you look at the map above, we've circled the area in red for you. There is no marked location near Sgt. Winter, but it's south of Foxy Floodgate across the frozen lake, and northwest of Masked Meadows.


Once you land at the crashed plane, you'll immediately see Sgt. Winter standing near the front of the plane. Speak to him to complete your first quest for the Winterfest event!


Be aware that a lot of people are dropping here either to do this first quest, or to get some easy kills by taking out those doing the quest. Just make sure you drop close to Sgt. Winters and immediately speak to him to complete the quest before someone wipes you out.


Another option is to land just outside of the area where Sgt. Winter is, wait for a minute or two, then go in and speak to him. The next quest has you speaking to Noir on the top floor of a building in Seaport City, so it too will require dealing with a high-activity drop area.


As with most quests in Fortnite, you can also open your Quests window and click on the Case Assignment for Sgt. Winter to get a marker placed on your map that indicates where Sgt. Winter can be found.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The annual Fortnite Winterfest is here, bringing holiday-themed events, quests, and most importantly, presents. However, some users have reported not being able to see or get any presents from the Fortnite Winterfest event. Here's some solutions on how to fix the no present bug in Fortnite Winterfest and start earning presents for the event.


Screenshot by Destructoid


How to fix no presents in Fortnite Winterfest


For most players, the no present bug in Fortnite Winterfest is actually just a visual bug that occurs because Fortnite will only show so many quests for each game mode. Therefore, you should switch game modes to get the game to force the Daily Gifts present popup to trigger. This means if you are on build mode, try switching to zero build, and vice versa. This fixes the no present bug issue for most players.


However, if you're still having the bug, or you were able to get to the present screen in the lodge but it says you have none when you should, there are some more things you can try:



Make sure the Fortnite servers aren't having problems. If the servers are down or congested from a lot of players jumping in right when they come online, it can lag out the presents. In this case, just try again later.


Double check your own internet connection. If your internet connection is dropping or unstable it can also make the presents not load. If you are on a wireless connection, try switching to a more stable wired one.


Check your Fortnite version. The easiest way to do this fix is to simply restart your game which should trigger the latest update to start downloading. If you're not on the most up-to-date version, new features like the presents will not work.



Keep in mind you will receive one new preset per day, so if you've already opened todays, you have to wait until reset you obtain your next one.

Taiko no Tatsujin: Rhythm Festival simulates the famous Japanese drum instrument and lets you go bananas with the Joycon or a specific taiko controller (if you have the money for it). You're drumming with the left and right Joycon to the beat, in a frantic manner, to familiar songs like Undertale's "Megalovania," Frozen 2's "Into the Unknown," and e…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been months since Helldivers turned the bug-addled planet of Meridia into a gaping black hole. I nearly forgot about it. But something is amiss... and possibly undemocratic. The Meridia black hole in Helldivers 2 is different, and the Illuminate invasion is making a beeline straight to it.


That's bad, right? I mean, having a yawning black hole where a colonized planet used to be isn't fantastic for myriad reasons, but the returning alien force's interest in it can't be positive. At least, it certainly seems like Illuminate forces are heading its way. The faction's mysterious movements haven't avoided the community's notice, as some are raising the alarm. 




The image above is from yesterday and it's already out of date. Today, the Illuminate is occupying a planet in the Ursa Secto…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If ancient aquatic animals are your thing, then you’ll love exploring Ancient Isle in Fisch, the hit fishing simulator on Roblox. There are tons of prehistoric fish you’ll have a blast catching, including massive beasts that once prowled the ocean.


The Megalodon is one of the most impressive of these behemoths, so it makes sense that even getting some of its parts is no small feat. This includes the Meg’s Spine. If you’re on the hunt for this spine but need help, that’s what we’re here for.


Where to find Meg’s Spine in Fisch


Much like the Megalodon itself, the Meg’s Spine can be found exclusively at Ancient Isle. While anywhere on the island is able to spawn it, you’ll have the best luck catching Meg’s Spine at the waterfall at the front of the island.

Historically, domain name registries have been hesitant to take action but with the right approach, progress can be made. This week, anti-piracy group BREIN reported that following their complaints, the .nl and .eu registries took action against several 'pirate' domains. On closer inspection, it appears that copyright has little to do with it.

Digital Eclipse has announced that the curious Tetris sequel Welltris will be added to the excellent compilation title Tetris Forever via a free update on Switch.
The game, originally release in 1989, takes the same basic gameplay of Tetris, but adds in an extra dimension, essentially turning the gameplay area into a 'well'. It's weird stuff, and it's no surprise that it didn't quite reach the same cultural heights as its predecessor, but it's an excellent new addition to the game nevertheless. Digital Eclipse also promises to add more games in the future, so keep your eyes peeled.

The only thing missing from his account of the game was the bread needed to make that rich, meaty concoction a tasty, nourishing sandwich.
And by bread, I of course mean the strategic layer - the parts between the turn-based battles where you pick your next mission, improve your squads, deal with pop-up story events, appraise your standing with each NPC faction, and equip your strike cruiser with auxiliary systems. Developers Overhype have now shared a few details of how it all works. Mmmmm, such malty, yeasty strategicalness.

Is usually intended to test out the new and the strange of gaming hardware. Instead, I want to talk about mini PCs – not just small-form-factor desktops, but properly tiny, box o’ chocolates-sized computers – which have, of course, been around for decades.
Recently, however, I’ve been wondering if mini PCs are finally on the cusp of having their moment as serious games machines. Between rising desktop component prices and ever-ballooning electricity bills, it would make sense that a smaller, cheaper system would take on a new appeal, and the success of handhelds like the Steam Deck and Asus ROG Ally show that convenience still trumps out-and-out performance for a lot of PC players. There have even been hints that Valve are resurrecting their Steam Machine mini PC concept, years after a flopping first attempt. Should you be interested?

If there were a trophy for missing open goals, Nintendo would have a fair few in the cabinet. For example, why didn't we get a new Donkey Kong game back when the Super Mario Bros. movie launched last year? Why wasn't the Wii U called 'Wii 2'? And why, for the love of god, is there no Nintendogs game on Switch?
There was a part of me, obviously swayed by some kind of Mandela effect, that was convinced the doggy daycare sim had gone on walkies on our beloved Nintendo hybrid in the last eight years. But no, I have consulted the Ancient Scrolls (our games database) and braved the Switch eShop, and no such game exists. That is, apart from the eerily similar-looking Little Friends: Dogs & Cats, but that's no purebred Nintendo puppy.

Its structure most resembles Songs of Conquest or Heroes of Might and/or Magic, but with little RPG emphasis or base building, and minimal tactical fighting.
Taxonomy is arbitrary and often unimportant at the end of the day, but I am very glad to firmly rule it out of one category: It's not a bloody card game. It looks like one, sure. You do most things with cards, and characters acquire more cards over time. But even if you absolutely, utterly, and correctly loathe card-based systems, this game has none.

The pair of directors were originally appointed to Epic's board by Tencent (who slurp upon a minority stake in the Unreal Engine company) but the United States government took a look at this and said: ah-ah-ah, you're not allowed to have a director in your boardroom if they're already fingers-deep in the pie of a competing company.

Nintendo’s been involved in its fair share of legal battles over the years, but we have a feeling it might be thinking twice before taking on publisher Pix Arts over the recent release of Monkey Kong In New-York on the Nintendo Switch.
Granted, Nintendo can do whatever it likes, and if it thinks there’s even the slightest chance that it might win a legal case, then chances are it will send its ninjas to battle at the earliest opportunity. What’s interesting about this particular game, however, is that it reminds us of a previous legal battle fought between Nintendo and Universal back in 1983.

Monthly Splatfests are a thing of the past for Splatoon 3 these days, but Nintendo is still keeping the seasonal events coming. With Splatoween out the way, the next one to roll around is Frosty Fest, a festive celebration which will be heading to the Splatlands next month.
As revealed in a tweet by @NintendoUK, the Frosty Fest Splatfest will get underway from 11th-12th January 2025 (depending on your region), with the theme this time asking 'What would make you happiest?'

If a glance at most of our Nintendo Switch Year in Review stats is anything to go by, then more than a few of us have spent a good bit of time with Balatro this year. We've spent so long with it, in fact, that its iconography is pretty much burned into our minds by this point. It sure would be a shame if one joke tweet made us see the whole thing differently, huh?
Well, we're sorry, but that's exactly what has happened. It all started with a tweet by @JacobJanerka, who shared that he sees the game's mascot, Jimbo, not as a clown wearing a blue ruffle collar but as a guy with a giant head wearing a blue jumpsuit — it's the KFC Colonel all over again

Out now on the eShop, the Takahiro Miyazawa-developed game requires you to connect the wrist strap attachments in a way that allows one of the Joy-Con controllers to dangle, allowing you to effectively simulate the 'swing' of a golf club.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Coordinated by Italy last month, a huge law enforcement operation reportedly 'dismantled' a pirate IPTV service with 22 million users. That's an extraordinary number and shows why countries like Italy have adopted mass site blocking measures. Logic suggests that the removal of such a huge player from the market might reduce the need for blocking measures, if only temporarily. The data shows that in the wake of the action, blocking demands significantly increased.

At least that's what the interstellar pilots of Elite Dangerous are celebrating in the galaxy-sized multiplayer space sim. Earlier this month, the Thargoid menace finally landed in the Sol system, putting earth itself under threat for the first time, not to mention other human homeworlds and colonies. This meant players were invited to drop everything and head for home - to embark on one last great stand against the final, desperate, and dangerous alien attacker: a Thargoid Titan called "Cocijo". Don't worry, they got him.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Frostpunk developers 11 bit studios have cancelled a new, console-oriented game in response to both "shifting market trends" - in particular, declining player enthusiasm for "narrative-driven, story-rich games" - and specific problems during development. As a consequence, a number of 11 bit staff are going to lose their jobs, though at least half of the affected development team are being offered the chance to move to other projects, including a few unannounced ones.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At any given moment I am in the center of a wonderful vortex of skeletons. Bones splash and rattle and burst out of the ground in sharp, horrible spurs. My weakest skeletons, sensing their death coming, explode into fire and shards. My strongest skeletons fight so hard and with such alacrity that upon dying, they drag their spirits together and keep fighting as ghosts for a while. Foul little bone scorpions skitter around on fans of legs made from human hands. Somewhere in the middle, almost invisible among the noise, is the character I am actually playing: Path of Exile 2’s mean-spirited, callous, and gleefully enjoyable Witch.
This is a review in progress. It has to be. Even in its incomplete early access period, Path of Exile 2 is a great sprawling mass of a game. Three meaty acts of a planned six act campaign are followed by a trickier return tour through them, before the absurd endgame kicks into gear and the real work begins. If I came to you having played everything on offer I would be wild-haired, bloodshot-eyed and possessing perfect, incomprehensible knowledge. Let’s compromise: I have toured the dark caverns and the antediluvian crypts. I have been killed by various accumulated nasties. I’ve had a great time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The announcement of The Witcher 4 with The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt's Ciri as protagonist has attracted a bit of discussion. Some of the reaction is online toddlers waxing wroth about a video game having a (somewhat older!!!) woman as lead character, and especially, shock, a video game in a series that has hitherto starred a man. And some of it is people commenting more thoughtfully on whether Ciri genuinely makes for a suitable Witcher protagonist, given that she isn't the product of the typical Witcher genetic modification regime (which is heavily tailored towards men), and given that, without spoiling too much, she has gifts that make crumbly old Geralt's sword-and-sorcery skillset look rather paltry. 


Speaking to Eurogamer this week, game director Sebastian Kalemba and narrative director Philipp Weber responded to a few of these comments, and also shared a little about Ciri's situation at the start of the game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["We are a people who honour democracy," said the dog, scratching himself. "Per our custom, you may drink of our fresh water." The dog was called Senator Umeshefaat, and he was very civil, even if he was shedding his black and white fur everywhere. We spoke in his home village at dawn. Later, I examined the senator's personal history more thoroughly and discovered he was "hated by bears for cooking them a rancid meal." I suppose every politician has their enemies. 
That Caves Of Qud creates fun anecdotes out of simple encounters shouldn't be a surprise. It has had 15 years of early access to establish itself as a small-but-mighty story generating roguelike of repute (there's a reason it sits deservedly side-by-side with Dwarf Fortress in the same publishing house). After creating many characters, and dying and dying and dying again, I understand why it grips the brain with such fierce glee. It is a machine of grand imagination and adventuresome comedy. A deceptively powerful RPG that isn't half as obtuse to newcomers as the screenshots make it out to be. Qud's low-res bark is just a complement to its bite.

Previously, on my mission to survive S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl with only wild mutants as my weapons, I’d discovered clues that someone else was attempting to tame the Zone’s beastly inhabitants. With one of their electronic tracking collars in hand and absolutely no preexisting knowledge of their location, I set out to find this kindred spirit, only for the Zone to once again slam a door in my face.
A cold, steel, very literal door to boot. It turns out that the scientist’s laboratory is locked up tight, and will remain so until I delve about twenty hours deeper into the faction war that’s bubbled up while I’ve been running around throwing irradiated rats at people in tracksuits.

Since then the modding team has grown to 40 people and the scope of the mod's features has ballooned. It's now going to include new moves, stages, costumes, and a chaotic-looking 2v2 multiplayer tag team mode. All good news for biff 'em up sickos, as the mod is due to release on Friday.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[First revealed all the way back in December 2023, Archetype Entertainment and Blur Studio's sci-fi action adventure Exodus hit us with a few things: Matthew McConaughey is involved, it looks a bit like Mass Effect, it's being developed by BioWare veterans, and it loves a bit of time dilation. In October of this year, we got a look at some icky celestial faction and zero in the way of actual gameplay. And now? Now we finally get a look at how you do things. Like sucker-punching armoured space bears in the face with electro-pistols.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After much teasing, the vicious tyrants of Arrowhead Games and their noxious puppets, the "democratic government" of Super Earth, have announced the very first Helldivers 2 licensed crossover. In yet another hollow display of solidarity and "Liber-tea", they've teamed up with the loathsome fascists of Killzone, the elderly shooter series from Sony and Guerrilla Games.
From today, you'll be able to buy weapons, armour and cosmetics belonging to Killzone's despicable stormtroopers from the Helldivers Superstore, and there's the suggestion of an additional Killzone-themed reward depending on the fortunes of the so-called Galactic War, a xenocidal bloodbath couched as an exercise in bringing "freedom" to the upstanding socialist Automatons, the blameless wildlife of the Tyranids, and the Wellsian cosplayers of the recently added Illuminate faction.
We here at Rock Paper Shotgun stand against Super Earth and Arrowhead's wanton aggression, which absolutely isn't a big satirical joke based on some Verhoeven film or other. Anyway, those capes. Find an image and further details below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Times Of Progress is a special game for me, because it's the first news tip I have ever received from Sin Vega, Prime Minister of Strategy Gaming. Sin once described writing news articles for our former news editor Alice0 (RPS in peace) as like practising backflips in front of the kung fu master. Writing about a new city builder at Sin's suggestion is like being invited to budget the development of Londinium by Julius Caesar.
The terror of screwing it up - together with other, more trivial distractions, like international games industry conferences - has stopped me from writing about Times Of Progress for months. Today I bite the bullet, and emerge from my lodgings to issue a hesitant speech to the masses, hoping like hell that Caesar is too preoccupied with the latest Gaul uprising to notice my errors.

Judges in two separate proceedings have now acquitted all 23 after concluding that this type of piracy isn't actually a crime.

And now I know: changing gears is a fucking chore. This year, in my mid-thirties, I finally learned to drive. And weirdly, a racing game about destroying clapped-out old bangers helped me along.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CD Projekt have screened the first trailer for The Witcher 4, the next instalment in their fantasy monster-slaying series. It’s another single player open world RPG, and The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt’s Ciri is the protagonist. In fact, she's the protagonist for a whole new Witcher saga, though there’s a tease at the end of the footage that crusty old Geralt may return as well.

If, like me, you really enjoyed the French developers' previous martial art sims, you might, like me, find this news deflating. Football? We already have that at home. It's like a martial art, but all you get to kick is some... ball.
I'm not sure I'll ever entirely swallow my disappointment, but credit where it's due, Rematch does look like both an enjoyable game and a quietly disruptive one. It's also struck a chord with me inasmuch as it's a new way into the culture of a sport which I have pretty mixed feelings about.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A master thief creeps over cobbles in an early modern metropolis that splits the difference between Edinburgh, Glasgow and Liverpool. Lit by gaslamps that can’t quite dispel the industrial haze, they pass for a civilian - a rough one, admittedly, but not shady enough to cause an itch in the swordarm of any passing guard.
Until, that is, they take to the thieves’ highway - following the trajectory of their grappling hook upward to the rooftops, from which they can see the shape of the city, and the moon beyond. Up here, it’s a parallel world - the trees on street level answered by chimney stacks, and the distant hills echoed by the rise and fall of steep gables. “We’re super proud of these rooftops,” says Greg LoPiccolo. “It’s an amazing landscape that we put a lot of thought and effort into, and it’s a lot of fun to traverse.”
Back in 1998, LoPiccolo was the game director who saw Thief: The Dark Project to completion. Today - after an 18 year detour to Harmonix to lead projects like Guitar Hero and Rock Band, among other adventures - he’s the game director of Thick as Thieves. “It really is an opportunity to do something unique and cool and new, on the shoulders of this stuff that is now well-respected,” he says. “Thief has some legs, right? People still talk about it to some degree.”

Just saying, this had better be good, Geoff, especially after the 2023 show’s "embarrassing" shooing-off of developers whose acceptance speeches cut into that valuable trailer showcase time.
Who will need to please wrap it up this time? Which games will be revealed? Will there be a musical number to top last year’s Herald of Darkness performance? (That was fun, actually, fair play on that one.) You can find out right along with us, as we once again fire up the RPS liveblog-o-tron to report all the developments as they happen.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At first I thought Marvel Rivals was basically rebranded Overwatch, in the way it's a free-to-play PVP hero shooter. And in some ways, it is. Fights are like if you took a MOBA and forced both teams to bash heads constantly. Success lies in picking off Spider-Man or Squirrel Girl or Marcus Fenix so as they wait to respawn, you hop on the big area that needs capturing. Or you push the cart while tanky Hulk absorbs bullets with his biceps and John Marvel snipes from afar.
The more I played Rivals, though, the more it hit me that it's specifically a messier, more complex Overwatch. A hero shooter with a surprising amount of polish and charm, sure, but also one that slides off my brain like water off Birdman's back. I understand why it's supremely popular at the moment and yet, I really don't.

I’ve engineered a Bloodsucker attack that wiped out the worst of villains – someone who was mean to me – and I’ve progressed far enough to really open up the map, and with it, access to more of the Zone’s fiercest fleshwarps.
Also, rats. Buoyed by the successful Bloodsucker siccing, I’m back on the trail of some mysterious anomaly scanners, and word is I might find a lead inside a local maze of wrecked cars. It’s heavily guarded by some gangster types, but for once, I won’t have to dash off in search of some far-off muties and coax them back here using my neck as bait. Mercifully, a gaggle of overgrown rodents are already hopping around right outside the labyrinth’s entrance. I beckon them in like a bouncer on his last day, then sprint past the stunned gunmen, who can barely shoulder their rifles before being set upon by a pack of giant carnivorous hamsters.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In more ways than one, today’s Total War: Warhammer 3 expansion marks a milestone for game director Rich Aldridge and his team at Creative Assembly. Omens Of Destruction’s three headline legendary lords each bring new campaigns and units for their respective factions, but it’s the fourth lord - a Khorne champion free to all players - that I imagine Aldridge will end up remembering the most fondly.
When Total War: Warhammer released back in 2016, it shipped with eight legendary lords - famous characters from Games Workshop’s fantasy setting that here act as faction leaders. The number grew steadily and, in terms of announcement order at least, today’s addition of Arbaal The Undefeated marks the series’ 100th. That's a hundred campaigns, a hundred joint efforts of game design, animation, art, writing and voice work.
Aldridge has never been shy about the team’s ambition for the series to eventually offer up each unit from every Fantasy Battle 6th edition army book ("The goal is to do everything, right?"). But ambition is one thing, and considering the fraught conditions at Creative Assembly and parent company Sega over the past few years, it’s not just the addition of the 100th lord that feels like something to celebrate. It’s taken time, effort, and a siesmic shift in update frequency, but Total War: Warhammer III is in the best place it's ever been.

It seems to play a bit like XCOM, with an oppressive world map that is slowly encroached upon as you travel around recruiting soldiers, interacting with settlements, and picking real-time fights with hellfiends "inspired by biblical descriptions and European folklore". Naturally, parallels with real-life xenophobia and sectarian hatred abound. Here's the trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If your PC has ever started randomly roaring, and you check Steam only to find Space Marine 2 is panic-installing a 9 billion gigabyte update, then perhaps Valve's new upcoming feature is for you. For most of us, Steam simply slurps down fresh gigs of installed games automatically when a new update is released (and sometimes schedules the updates according to its own capricious whims). But the platform is testing a new option in the beta client, which lets you set download behaviour to git new gigs only when you actually launch a game. This would be a terrible curse, for reasons I will explain, but it's only going to be an option - not the new default.

Rock Paper Shotgun’s CMS (content management system) even has a built-in widget that shouts at me if I don’t write at least 250 words. "Page 1 body content is quite short" it says if I go under. How cute is that "quite"? I love being fooled into getting charmed by automated systems via colloquial British understatement. Anyway, I bring this up because I honestly don’t have anything to add about Blippo+. I just wanted to inform you all of its existence.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Creation is an act of kindness. One person sloughs off a piece of themselves, shapes it, wraps it, and sends it out into the world in the hope that it might mean something to someone else. Other people do this for us all the time and mostly we don't even notice. The work is unseen and unremarked upon even as, through repetition, we come to depend upon it. Until, one day, that light that they shine can't be seen. Maybe you left home, or maybe they did, but now it's your turn to perform such acts of kindness. To carry the tradition forward for others - and for yourself.

Friends, it's time to play Skeal.

Curiosmos is a very different game, but it has a little of the same appeal. It's a galactic playground in which you smash meteors together to make planets, then tinker with the ecosystems of those planets to make life and watch that life evolve. All while a hungry black hole lingers nearby, eager to consume everything you have created. There's an explanatory video below.

Fortunately, I was rolling a Witch - perhaps the best beginner POE2 class - so I could summon an army of skeletons in response. A similar horde vs horde encounter is underway at POE 2 developers Grinding Gear Games. The game launched in early access over the weekend, and has already drawn so many players that the developers are emergency-hiring additional staff to cope with the waves of support emails.

Sampling the demo, I was immediately enflamed by the orchestral score and placed in a mood of white-gloved sophistication only slightly spoiled by the familiarity of the underlying platform moveset, and by my repeatedly falling into pits.

Not only that, it's arriving with all the tramming of the original, with an added "scheduled mode" that adds more charm to an already lovely game.

Quite specific of you, but a new documentary from Noclip might just have what you’re looking for. The Past, Present & Future of Soul Reaver interviews key developers from the action adventure game, and about halfway through host Danny O’ Dwyer gets hold of some archive materials, including old audition tapes. These include Mark Hamill reading for Janos Audren, and Jennifer Hale for Ariel.
The biggest treat, of course, is hearing Hayter read for Raziel, especially as it’s that excellent opening monologue. You’ll find the video below, with Hayter around 37:30.

The base game is also 55% off on Steam until the 18th of December, with the Phantom Liberty expansion at 20% off, or both in a 48% off bundle. Cyberpunk is on sale often enough, although these current discounts line up with the cheapest it's ever been on Steam. Again: worth it for the line.

To be more specific, it's Animal Crossing but your chibi fox protagonist is specifically running a shop, mending and painting objects to sell while maintaining cleanliness and the plants outside. If you can't get enough of upcycling in Trash Goblin, here's one more for you.

It looks to follow much of what made the first so well liked, including its pocket-sized black-and-white worlds in which you wander about, snapping photos and helping the locals.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pity the "relaxing" games which set out to blanket their players in a wholesome fog. These minimalist or slight experiences set their stall against the mainstream philosophy of video game design focused on action, rules, clear progression, and often violence. So it is with Naiad, a sometimes pleasant swim down a river in which you sing to make flowers grow and discover poems by interacting with birds, bees, butterflies and other fauna. 

Yet here's the cause of my pity. All those other games, with their decisive action, systemic consequence, and neck-snapping: I was playing those to relax, too. Why else would I have snapped all those necks? Being shorn of base pleasures does not make Naiad a restorative oasis amid a desert of stressful video games, and it doesn't make it more relaxing than its peers. In fact, it makes for an experience that left me restless, even a little anxious, when it made me feel anything at all.

Whichever it is, Little Rocket Lab is a factory-builder about efficiently placing conveyors and robot arms, and is drawn in the warm, pixel art small-town of a Stardew-like. That sounds like a fitting combination, although it does mean you're building a NASA-sized rocketship on the outskirts of your quaint hometown. That can't be good for noise pollution. There's an announcement trailer below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Marvel Rivals, the free-to-play hero shooter from NetEase, launched late last week and is exceedingly popular. It's currently fourth on the Steam daily most played, right between Path Of Exile 2 and the evergreen Grand Theft Auto 5. I think there are three reasons for this enthusiasm: 1) it's free-to-play with the usual comet's tail of microtransactables 2) it's third-person Overwatch with Marvel characters, a straightforwardly enticing licensing sandwich, and 3) people want to have sex with a larger-than-usual proportion of the cast and especially awful tongue-monster Venom, who has a good butt in this one. No, I'm not going to share pictures. You'll have to google that filth yourself.


But perhaps you are a sophisticated soul who has no time for such salacious nonsense. You're more interested in hearing how they're patching the thing. Enough with the butts already, dang it - this is a new multiplayer game so there must, of course, be patches! Fair enough: here's what NetEase are changing or fixing in the first major update, out now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I feel guilty about repeatedly comparing Nebulous: Fleet Command to Homeworld, inasmuch as it's an appalling bait-and-switch. It's like offering somebody a cake that is actually a cunningly painted hunk of torpedo fuselage. It's like offering to shake hands while wearing one of those comedy hand buzzers - except that the hand buzzer is an intricate simulation of zero-G physics, missile behaviours and comms jamming, featuring spacecraft with proper internal layouts that require you to think hard about attitude control if you don't want, say, your engines to become Swiss cheese about 90 seconds before you need to retreat from combat. 


Being a "true" 3D real-time space strategy game, Nebulous looks and sounds a lot like Homeworld on the surface, but it's nothing like as straightforward. It is systems within systems. It is a game in which you can, theoretically, plot the path of a single guided munition through an asteroid field, so as to catch an enemy cruiser in the back. I barely understand how to make a ship fire on another ship, using plain old armour-piercing shells, and now they're threatening to add carriers, fighters and bombers. Customisable ones! The humanity. Here's a trailer.

Spoilers: our news editor is me, and I have already thrown your complaint in the bin. Mate, I don't tell you how to do your job, but I'd be more than happy to, if you let me know what it is.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[London Gatwick Airport is a rare shade of brown, known to neither science nor art. A brown that doesn’t appear on the light spectrum. No easel contains it. It is a dusty brown, a damp brown, a hot and earthy brown that hums with the stinging malodour of disturbed ancient moss where once old forests stood. Descending into Gatwick’s cloying brown from 33,000 feet is like flying under and up Gandalf’s wretched cloak and landing in one of the several horrible little magic pouches he keeps by his balls.
Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 captures Gatwick’s brown perfectly. Next to the stupefying natural beauty of Yosemite, the imposing imperial skyscrapers of the Manhattan skyline and the surging majesty of the Alpine peaks, this local rot-tinged patch of West Sussex is the most impressively realistic depiction of a place I have seen in a game.

It's basic physics. In this case, I was on holiday from Friday through Monday, and this fact and this fact alone appears to have coaxed some toy manufacturer into taking the internet's most cherished indie gaming platform offline by means of a "bogus" phishing report, sent by "AI-powered" brand protection software.
The situation has now been resolved, thankfully, and you can access Itch.io as normal, but I will never pass up the opportunity to cast shade on Funko Pop, whose NFT-garlanded bobbleheads I hate as I do veruccas and forest fires. So here's a quick recap if you, too, missed the drama.

Early stages soon lose any real sense of surprise, and later ones can feel low on real agency. I want a new roguelike run to feel vital and verdant; heady with grand plans and plan-shattering twists. But by having randomness influence each run so significantly, Mystery Dungeon feels fickle instead of emergent - less than the sum of some incredibly novel and creative parts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Za pár dní má v našich kinech (a po celém světě) premiéru "remasterovaná verze" kultovní animované podívané Interstella 5555. A je důležité říct si něco o tom, o jakou podívanou vlastně jde a v čem přesně spočívá ten "remaster".
U zrodu tohoto počinu stálo elektronické hudební duo Daft Punk, které v roce 2001 vydalo své album "Discovery". K písničkám z alba vyšly animované videoklipy, které produkoval Leidži Macumoto, což byl kultovní japonský výtvarník (zemřel loni), který měl na svém kontě mnoho animovaných seriálů, především ze 70. - 80. let (nejslavnější z nich byl asi "Space Battleship Yamato"). Daft Punk ho oslovili proto, že na jeho seriálech vyrůstali, takže výsledné dílo, včetně "jednodušší" retro animace a naivní zápletky zcela záměrně připomíná staré japonské televizní počiny (n…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Greece is buzzing with news of a historic, landmark decision by a local court, to imprison a person for five months for subscribing to a pirate IPTV service. The news warrants an informed conversation about creators' rights and how the judicial system has sharpened its response to piracy. However, until evidence is produced to the contrary, the story should be stamped "propaganda" and noted for an offense of its own: a distraction from genuine progress in the fight against piracy.

Total Eclipse and Total Eclipse 2.
Thimbleweed Park.
The Space Bar.
Moonbase Commander. (with multiplayer support)
Backyard Basketball.
Unrest.
Rise of the Dragon.
Castle Master.

A detailed list of all exciting new features and fixes is available in our NEWS file.
We are looking forward to your reports about successful and unsuccessful playthroughs and bugs reported!
