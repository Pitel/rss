Now this is a crossover that just makes sense. Passion Republic Games, the team behind this summer's sleeper GigaBash, announced it's working with one of the world's oldest movie stars. Though details are extremely scarce, GigaBash is collaborating with Godzilla on "something really special." Outside of the trailer below, that's about all we have to go on.
Does this mean Godzilla is coming to the game as a DLC character? It's possible. Heck, the entire Toho roster of kaiju could be joining in on the fun. But we just don't know because the only information Passion Republic Games has given us is that it's collaborating with Godzilla on "something really special."
In fact, with such little information, this arguably isn't a story worth reporting on. But I love Godzi…]]></summary>

Integrating numbers from HowLongToBeat, most Game Pass games' pages now suggests how long a game is in several playstyles: finishing the main story; doing the main story and optional extras; and absolutely 100%ing everything. While I usually find talk of game length is tied into awful opinions that longer is better, I think this is great info to know on Game Pass.

We all know what it's like to search through boxes of old junk only to discover an absolute gem hidden amongst the rubble. It might be an old magazine you cherished as a child, or a boxed NES game that you thought had been lost to the ages.
It's an invigorating feeling, to be sure, but we reckon you'd be hard-pressed to match a recent discovery made by Nintendo Life reader Jason Woods. After gathering up his old possessions from his parents' house, he came across a sealed copy of what seems to be a sample copy of the very first issue of Nintendo Power magazine, still in its original envelope.

As you can imagine, this is an easier task for Nate than it is to me, because many of his favourite games are predicated around era changes. Thus I find myself in the position of arguing semantics. How the turn tables have turned.
I'm able to win Nate around on at least one of my desperate bids to classify things that aren't eras as eras, although he does promptly shut me down on the most ridiculous one. It may surprise you to know that we don't actually talk about too many history games (although time travel comes up a lot). And stick around for a thrilling Cavern Of Lies.

Capcom brought the goods to Tokyo Game Show this morning, not only revealing four classic characters for its upcoming scrapper Street Fighter 6, but also lifting the lid on its multiplayer-based Battle Hub, its custom-character World Tour mode, and a wide variety of other features coming to the sequel.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4qAARQdHO4
World Tour mode will see players develop their own fighter from scratch, fully customizing their bespoke fighter's height, weight, look, style, and personality, before embarking on a journey around the Street Fighter universe, honing their abilities at the tutelage of some faithful SF World Warriors. Players can then pit their custom fighters against other characters within this world, or enter the Battle Hub to challenge other players from across the globe.
Said Battle Hub, as expected, will play host to most multiplayer options. Alongside standard one-on-one matches, players can also engage in the goofy new "Extreme Match" mode, which adds hazards, buffs, debuffs, traps, and other silly hurdles to the battleground. In addition, when not rocking the ring, players can sit down and enjoy some old-school Capcom classics, such as Street Fighter II and Final Fight, from within the hub's own arcade.
A Closed Beta was also announced, which will take place on all platforms for the weekend October 7 — October 10. You can throw your name in the hat and/or ring over on the official website.

The Resident Evil 4 remake is targeting newer console hardware and PC. But today, Capcom confirms it is also bringing the Resident Evil 4 remake to PS4.
During today's Tokyo Game Show 2022 presentation, producer Yoshiaki Hirabayashi confirmed that Resident Evil 4 that the team had been looking into ways to bring RE4 to previous generation hardware. Because of that, Resident Evil 4 is now also in development for PS4. He doesn't mention Xbox One though, so it seems like that console's left off the list for now, at least.

Hirabayashi also confirms there is a Resident Evil Showcase planned for next month. No exact date has been set for that as of this writing.
Back in the saddle again
The Resident Evil 4 remake is the latest RE remake from Capcom. It's set to re-tell the events of Leon Kennedy's rescue of the president's daughter, in what's likely one of the most well-remembered entries in the Resident Evil series.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L1EuRo54pI
RE4 was long-rumored to be in development when it was finally revealed back in June, and it's not a long wait until it's out, either. Capcom has locked in a March 24, 2023 release date for Resident Evil 4.
The studio is also planning on PlayStation VR 2 content. It's likely we'll see more of what it has planned for RE4 in particular at next month's Resident Evil showcase. But with this news, at least PlayStation 4 owners won't have to upgrade immediately to experience Leon's adventure in new detail all over again.

Today during Capcom's Online Program stream (that's what it's called!), the publisher confirmed that Mega Man Battle Network Switch online play is currently being worked on.
Here's what they had to say right on stream: "We're currently working on online functions such as chip battles and chip trading." Simple enough! This will, in theory, allow players to confront each other just like back in the portable-versus days, and trade abilities with one another. Yes, it's highly reminiscent of Pokemon, like many other portable games of that era. Capcom used the phrase "every series" when they were talking about what games would be impacted, and later provided a full article regarding their online plans.
We had a few other bits of news too. On top of a fully voiced "3D" Mega Man main menu navigator for the main menu, extras include 1,000 illustrations and 188 songs across the represented games. You can find a reminder of what games are included in the Mega Man Battle Network re-release effort below. Capcom is calling the game a "two part" release, due out in 2023 (no precise date was provided in the stream today).
Mega Man Battle Network Switch Volume 1 game list:
Mega Man Battle Network
Mega Man Battle Network 2

Also showcased was the game's customization mode, which will enable players to ensure that their soldier stands out from the pack.
Hey, you might get swallowed by a T-Rex out there on the battlefield, but you can at least look stylish while doing so. Exoprimal will launch on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms at some point in 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's out on September 29
By the time the next Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak update hits, we'll be entering a new era in terms of paid cosmetic DLC.
As revealed in Capcom's "Online Program" TGS stream today: amid a number of content updates coming in Title Update 2, including the Violet Mizutsune, Flaming Espinas, and Risen Chameleos monsters; is the ability to unlock layered weapons. As a reminder, "layered" is a mechanic similar to "transmog/glamour" in other games, where you can make certain items (or characters) look a certain way. It allows players more freedom to customize their avatars, without having to take the aesthetic form of your current gear.

In series fashion, goofy weapon skins like corn cobs and kebabs were shown, in addition to more serious designs like the "Lost Code" weaponry that looks like it's out of a Gundam series. Beyond weapons, Capcom managed to throw in the phrase "various other paid DLC as well" in the stream, which they explained later in the presentation. Gestures, poses, hairstyles, and stickers were confirmed as part of the paid DLC initiative. There will also be weekly quests, with "unique rewards." One gesture shown in the video was a character saying "best doggo" and shaking their Palamute's hand.
Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak Update Version 1.2 (Title Update 2) will arrive on September 29.
The current (as of September 2022) Sunbreak update roadmap:

It is true that KEMCO can be a bit of a machine for churning out games of this type, and we would be hesitant to suggest that the majority of them develop the genre to any real extent; however, a sale like this is nonetheless a good chance to pad out your collection if you find yourself somewhat drawn to the company's style.

So what is Rayman? He's definitely not an animal, and he's certainly not adorable — instead, he's a human/aubergine (or eggplant) with no arms, legs, or neck. He's a little bit weird. But his games have struck a chord over the years with many.

        <updated>2022-09-15T13:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hand Of Fate was such a singular thing. On the one hand, it was a tabletop deckbuilding game that saw you picking through roguelike-style dungeons by choosing different cards dealt out by its mysterious Dealer. On the other, it was also an action-packed hack and slasher, bringing its fantastical fight sections to life in fully 3D combat arenas - and there hasn't been anything quite like it since. Voice Of Cards certainly had a go, but its tedious battle system landed it straight on its own discard pile. Thankfully, we've now got the infinitely more engaging Foretales, a new narrative card game from French developers Alkemi, and it comes pretty damn close to capturing that Hand Of Fate goodness. 
It doesn't ever venture into the realms of 3D admittedly, erring more toward the Inscryption school of tabletop combat encounters, but it does nail the delivery of telling an artful, swashbuckling adventure through cards and cards alone. And much like Hand Of Fate, this isn't a one and done affair, either, as there are multiple paths to take through this entertaining fantasy yarn, and several game-changing decisions you'll have to make as you try and avert a string of terrible visions threatening to destroy its anthropomorphic animal world. You won't succeed at preventing them all during a single playthrough, but its hard choices only make its overarching story that much more gripping.

Controversy surrounded the game after the mild-mannered cooking sim was abruptly pulled from the Switch eShop shortly after its release, leading to rumours of built-in cryptocurrency mining, unlawful use of copyrighted music, and disputes between the game's developer and publisher, Planet Entertainment, and the owners of the Cooking Mama series, Office Create.
Now distanced from the flame-eyed matriarch who has dominated Nintendo cooking titles since the mid-2000s, Planet Entertainment has announced its next chef-sim, Yum Yum Cookstar, will be coming to the Switch on October 4th, 2022.

Brazil-based developer Behold Studios is best known for delivering the Super Sentai/Power Rangers-inspired RPG Chroma Squad back in 2015. Now, the developer is moving on from tokusatsu to magical girl with its next game, Mahou Senshi Cosplay Club. This marks the developer's return to its RPG roots following 2019's party game Out of Space.
Announced yesterday, the game is slated for a 2023 release on "PC and major consoles", so it looks like a Switch version is on the horizon. However, it's not just the game's premise — where you play as a girl who gains magical powers by cosplaying and dressing up — that has us intrigued. Mahou Senshi Cosplay Club's polygonal graphics remind us of a lost, late N64 RPG that we never got, albeit with the power of modern-day design to make the colours really pop and the visuals a lot smoother.

Before we dive too far into this thing: if you’re here because you’ve got a kid and you just want to know if Disney Dreamlight Valley will make them happy, and that the rat from Ratatouille doesn’t say the f-word, and that at no point does Ariel drag herself onto the beach to try to recruit them into a multi-level marketing scam, then you’re golden. Disney Dreamlight Valley is a top-marks Animal Crossing rip-off that will make fans of too-big mice irreversibly giddy. Your children may eventually need a special operation to stop them smiling.

If you have read near enough any of the articles here at Nintendo Life over the past few weeks, you will know that we are serious fans of Splatoon 3.

The move was announced by surprise during this morning’s ID@Xbox stream at Tokyo Game Show, which I guess is appropriate for something to do with assassins. Odyssey’s predecessor Assassin’s Creed Origins was already plonked on to Microsoft’s subscription service in June this year.

Activision Blizzard has released the official trailer for the newest hero heading to Overwatch 2 — Kiriko is a young Japanese woman, a skillful practitioner of ninjutsu, who uses her stealth ability, mastery of martial arts, and seemingly almost supernatural skills in order to bring the win home for her team.
In addition, Activision Blizzard released its layout plans for the new shooter sequel's first season of content, detailing events, unlocks, battle pass rewards, and much more. Kiriko had been previously leaked online, but it's still nice to see her get her official moment in the spotlight. She looks pretty rad, too.
Overwatch 2 launches as a free-to-play title on October 4.

But while Taiwan attempts to outlaw highly capable 'Ubox' devices, the source of the problem remains. In simple terms, Chinese authorities are only concerned when a crime occurs inside China.

If you get joy out of washing and cleaning with hoses, you might want to keep an eye out for PowerWash Simulator. At the Tokyo Game Show today earlier today, Square Enix announced FuturLab Limited would be bringing the game to Switch at some point in the near future. This independant studio originally teamed up with SE last May as part of a Square Enix Collective collab.
As you can see in the amusing promotional video above, your job is to clean everything in sight with lots of water as you build your own power-washing business. This leads to new tools and upgrades to make the task easier. There's also a career mode - where you complete an assortment of "dirty jobs", and there's online co-op, too.

Nintendo's Direct presentation earlier this week was loaded with all sorts of announcements, and one of the highlights was the segment announcing a new batch of N64 games for the Switch Online's Expansion Pack service.
While GoldenEye 007 is arguably the highlight for many Switch owners out there, we're still curious to know exactly what our community here on Nintendo Life is most excited about, even if you don't have a subscription. We've also added in the Japan-only NSO release Harvest Moon 64.

Speaking to GameSpot, Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio head Masayoshi Yokoyama explained how the team is hesitant to port the series across to Nintendo's hybrid system as its family-friendly image could potentially clash with the "underground feeling" of the Yakuza series:

A Stranger Things actor is getting behind the wheel for a PlayStation picture. David Harbour has been cast to star in the upcoming Gran Turismo movie.
According to The Hollywood Reporter, the Sony Pictures and PlayStation Productions feature will cast Harbour as a retired driver and mentor. Harbour has garnered notoriety as Hopper in Stranger Things and as the Red Guardian in the Marvel universe.
The Gran Turismo movie will follow a teenage Gran Turismo player whose skills in-game lead to him winning a series of Nissan competitions. And thanks to his skills, he gets a chance to become a professional racecar driver.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQEondeGvKo
Neill Blomkamp, of District 9, is directing the project, with a script written by Jason Hall and Zach Baylin. Gran Turismo creator Kazunori Yamauchi is executive producing, alongside Hall.
It's set for a theatrical premiere on August 11, 2023.
More PlayStation pictures on the way
Sony has quite a number of different media projects and adaptations on the way, alongside Gran Turismo.
The HBO series of The Last of Us recently got a short teaser. A Twisted Metal TV adaptation has wrapped filming for the Peacock streaming service. Netflix recently confirmed its Horizon series is in development under The Umbrella Academy's showrunner.
And that's not counting reports of several other projects in development, ranging from Days Gone to Gravity Rush.
Basically, a lot of PlayStation franchises are getting their shot at the silver screen. Which, given the reception to Uncharted, could be a good or bad thing. What HBO has shown so far for The Last of Us TV series seems to be getting the tone right, at the least.
As for the Gran Turismo series, Gran Turismo 7 sounds like it turned out pretty solid. Hopefully that bodes well for its media adaptation aspirations.

No, no — not that Blockbuster. But I sure do have fond memories of picking out N64 games for weekend rentals.

The Sonic Frontiers Super Sonic trailer is here, thanks to a new clip Sega is sharing to celebrate the week of TGS (Tokyo Game Show).
It's a shortish little clip, giving us a little more background on the Starfall Islands, the locales therein, and some gameplay. At the end, we get a front-and-center look at the emeralds and the iconic Super Sonic power. "Harnessing the power of the emeralds" is a big part of the storyline this time around. As Sega puts it, "The Starfall Islands are home to strange and menacing foes that Sonic has never encountered before. Using an all-new battle system, join Sonic in confronting these titanic threats with upgraded combat skills, evasive maneuvers, and a few familiar tricks up his sleeve. Jump into adventure, harness the power of the Emeralds, and fight to stop these new, mysterious enemies!"
As you might have surmised, the trailer showcases the ending theme for the game once again: "Vandalize" from ONE OK ROCK. So far it seems to be getting more praise than the main theme, "I'm Here," from Merry Kirk-Holmes of To Octavia. If I had to compare the two, I would be OK (ha) with cementing Vandalize as the main theme.
So far, Sonic Frontiers is ticking more boxes the more time goes on. Now I don't want to sink into the Sonic Cycle and instill too much hope! But the Cyber Space level showing really hit home for me, and there was only one way they could have gone since the shaky initial showing of the game: up.

Some very pleasant news today for fans of the delightful indie hit TOEM: A Photo Adventure as developer Something We Made has announced that it is currently working on a DLC update for the snap-happy adventure, which will launch on all platforms, free of charge, at an unspecified date.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7N8mO84A6s
Speaking on the PlayStation Blog, Something We Made CEO Niklas Mikkelsen revealed that the update will include a brand new region, Basto, which will be unlocked once the player completes the main story adventure. Basto is an amalgamation of some of the ideas that did not make the cut for the initial release, and will feature new puzzles, characters, and even a brand new camera attachment: The Water Popper.
With six new music tracks, 20 new quests, and 20 new compendium critters to track down, Something We Made is predicting a good couple of hours of new adventure await all visitors to Basto.

      <p>At Gamescom 2022, we spoke to&nbsp;James&nbsp;Worrall and&nbsp;Adam Olsson, Creative Director and Art Director on Dead Island 2, to learn more about <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/gamescom-2022/2022/08/23/dead-island-2-gets-long-awaited-trailer-and-release-date" target="_blank">the long-awaited sequel</a>, how the team is balancing comedy and horror, and how exactly they plan to make zombies monstrous again with their procedural FLESH system. Set within the once-bustling city of Los Angeles, the game pulls inspiration from 80s action movies like <em>Die Hard</em> and George A. Romero's <em>Dawn Of The Dead</em> and features iconic locations overrun with hordes of zombies you can eviscerate piece by piece.&nbsp;</p>

[Featured Image Source: Thibault Miniou on ArtStation]
If you’ve read any of my features in the past, you’re probably well aware that I didn’t seriously get into games until I was in college. I had some consoles when I was younger, like a PS2, a Game Boy Advance SP, a Nintendo DS, and a Wii, but pretty much all of the games I played were “girly” horse-related, Barbie, or licensed Disney Channel spin-off games.
I had a great time with those games (which have merit in their own right), but I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t disappointed in retrospect that I missed out on some of the all-time greats. The good news is, now I’m an adult with my own time and money, and I’m fortunate enough to have a job centered around games — which means I can …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Check to see how long that new game will take to finish
The September update is rolling out for the Xbox app on PC, and it's got one particularly neat feature. Microsoft has partnered with HowLongToBeat to show game completion estimates inside the app.
HowLongToBeat has long been a valuable resource in sifting and sorting through my games. It's helped me decide which backlog games to start and when. Sometimes you want a long RPG adventure to pick away at, and sometimes you want something short-and-sweet, that you can finish in a weekend.
HLTB aggregates user contributions to share estimated completion times. This includes times for just the Main Story, or the Main Story and additional extras, or even a full completionist run.
With the September update, the Xbox app will display these numbers for "most" PC Game Pass games. So if Death Stranding is something you want to try out, you'll know just how long it'll take to beeline through it.

Other app improvements
The Xbox app is also getting some other updates. The Game Details pages are making it easier to find some sought-after details, like trailers, screenshots, and the game description.
Performance and reliability of the Xbox app are also getting a tune-up. Microsoft says that with the most recent update, the app now launches 15% faster, and it should be more responsive too. The Xbox post says the team has seen crash-free sessions improve to "99.9%", and search results should be getting more relevant as well.
All of these are great improvements, but as someone who uses the Xbox app to peruse Game Pass games I might want to take a gander at, I really dig this Xbox and HowLongToBeat integration. Hopefully it doesn't turn too many players away from longer games. But it is really nice to know an estimate for how much investment I'm getting into, for both lengthy and brief experiences.

The Sims is one of the most prolific series in gaming, and has managed to stay at the forefront of the games space for over twenty years. The Sims community is especially known for their mods, with the most recent entry Sims 4 being incredibly robust in that regard. Now, as a thank you to fans for making the game the success that it is, EA has announced that the base game of The Sims 4 will be free to download on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and Xbox One starting on October 18, 2022.
"EA and Maxis have welcomed millions of The Sims players over the years, and have watched in awe as they unleashed their imaginations, discovered and connected with ideas, experiences, and versions of themselves, both in-game and real life," EA said in a press release. "With The Sims 4 base game going free, the team is more dedicated than ever to developing new and meaningful experiences for players, and will continue to develop and release packs, Kits, and Sims Delivery Express drops into the foreseeable future."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFkqTSU9tSo
As if that's not good enough, players who have already purchased The Sims 4 by October 17 will get the Desert Luxe Kit as a free gift. EA Play and EA Play Pro members will also get a special treat on October 18 — with The Sims 4 EA Play Edition, players will get The Sims 4 Get To Work Expansion Pack, and the EA Play Pro Edition come with both The Sims 4 Get To Work Expansion Pack and The Sims 4 Toddler Stuff Pack.
In addition, EA will be hosting a special-edition stream on October 18 at 10 am PDT on The Sims' YouTube and Twitch channels called the "Behind The Sims Summit," which will give players an inside look into what the team has in the works. EA really pulled out all the stops for this one, because this has to be one of the coolest events I've seen in gaming in a while.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[International Treasure
One of the quieter, but no less exciting, headlines from yesterday's Nintendo Direct presentation was the announcement that Treasure's legendary shmup Radiant Silvergun is now available on Nintendo Switch. The 1998 smash hit can be purchased from the eShop right now, priced at an admittedly hefty $20.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGkOxWAhjbM
The Treasure-developed classic has something of a legacy with video game fans of a certain age, as it was mostly the stuff of legend to those who were not acquainted with the import scene, or had access to a decent arcade center. While considered one of the greatest shmups ever released to that point, Radiant Silvergun was tough to locate in North America and Europe, while the subsequent Sega Saturn port never left Japanese shores, and would fetch high prices on the secondary market.
Eventually, the frenetic shmup would find a wider audience through its 2011 Xbox 360 rerelease, and with this new Switch port, a new generation of shmup fans can blast off into the iconic action... It looks like you'll still have to pay through the nose for the privilege, but at least we aren't dropping $250 on eBay anymore. Rumors persist of a new Radiant Silvergun project, currently in the works to coincide with Treasure's 30th anniversary. With Tokyo Game Show kicking off tomorrow, the truth will likely be out soon enough.
Radiant Silvergun is available now on Nintendo Switch. (Shortly after writing this article, the listing mysteriously vanished from the North American version of the eShop, though it was still available for purchase elsewhere.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This applies to both games
Pokemon Stadium transfers are a no-go, according to the tiny text right there in the accompanying sizzle reel for the recent Nintendo 64 Switch additions.
Backing up a bit, during this week's Nintendo Direct, Nintendo confirmed a heap of Nintendo 64 games coming to Switch Online's Expansion Pack scheme: Pilotwings 64, Mario Party 64, Mario Party 2, Mario Party 3, Pokemon Stadium, Pokemon Stadium 2, 1080 Snowboarding, Excitebike 64, and GoldenEye 64.
Wait, Pokemon Stadium 1 and 2?! Yep! That seemingly includes the minigames, which for a lot of folks, are the real reward. Though naturally, the addition of these two into the mix did spark the discussion of transfers, which are a no-go. According to the text on the bottom of the screen during the introduction of those two re-releases: "Pokemon cannot be transferred to these games."
Given that rental Pokemon are an underlying part of the core series and the aforementioned minigames are in play, all of the as-is functionality of the two games softens the blow. That said, the inability to bring creatures in will make the core experience that much more arduous for a lot of folks (though there are completion runs with just rentals). At one point, transferring Pokemon into the Stadium series was an amazing gimmick, but for now, it'll be relegated to the past.
If you're interested in part of the reasoning behind the scenes, Serebii.net webmaster Joe Merrick breaks it down in a Twitter thread. It essentially has to do with reading Transfer Pak data, and how interactivity with the 3DS in any shape or form is not a priority for Nintendo given the imminent shutdown.

We've finally found out the title of Breath of the Wild 2 (which means we can stop calling it Breath of the Wild 2) alongside a brand-new trailer in the latest Nintendo Direct — and it's called Tears of the Kingdom, which has already set off a ton of theories.
You know what that means, Zelda fans — it's time to put our speculation hats on once more, and get to dissecting this trailer for every wee nugget of Zelda lore we can find.

It finally happened. I’ve been broken. I do my best to play through each game that comes for me as thoroughly as possible, but I just can’t do it for Food Truck Simulator. Which is a shame because I really liked Gas Station Simulator. I like what Drago Entertainment is doing by trying to build a shared simulator universe. I appreciate their vision. Goofy simulators also have a solid space in my heart.
But Food Truck Simulator is undercooked. I hate to pull out one of those puns that normally go in the closing paragraph of a review, but its biggest problems are all related to not just a lack of polish but a dearth of care. Considering this was, weirdly enough, one of my most anticipated games of this year, the disappointment is all mine.

Storage space has always been one of the Switch's downsides, with the system's internal memory never really being enough to house the many games, patches and more we find ourselves downloading these days. The issue makes a microSD card an essential purchase for any Switch owner and thankfully, there are plenty of great options available on the market already.
While you might want to opt for microSD cards that offer the best value for money, there are some fancier, officially-licensed designs available, and that range has now grown thanks to these new Fortnite cards. Both 128GB and 256GB sizes are available, with the latter naturally costing a little more, and they can be found at retailers like Amazon and Best Buy – stock is already proving a little sketchy, so we've also included links for you to buy them directly from manufacturer Western Digital below:

Fallout 76's The Pitt update is finally here, after weeks of previews from Bethesda on how it will continue to evolve the game.
As is customary with updates for Fallout 76, both large and small, there's a host of bug fixes (including power armor clipping!), as well as more quality-of-life features. A big one includes more fast travel control, including the ability to travel to an interior or exterior segment of select locations.
Interestingly, the new player experience (NPE) has been improved too. According to Bethesda, you'll now be "more prepared" to start a brand new game, as you'll be granted more items and equipment (including a "variety of consumables"). You'll also get a "vault fed" buff that assists in curbing hunger and thirst for two hours, and early enem…]]></summary>

Synduality is a new sci-fi shooter from Bandai Namco Entertainment with crystals to collect and giant alien enemies to fight. But the most dangerous threat might not be them, but other players.
This new mech game debuted at yesterday's Sony State of Play, showing off its combat and style. The thrust of Synduality is that you're in a dystopian future where poisonous rain and aggressive, mutated creatures have changed the world.
You and your AI partner need to build a home for humanity, and to do that, you need resources. As a Drifter, you make a living collecting AO crystals. (No, not that AO.) And so you set out in your mech, dubbed a Cradle Coffin, to find some and bring them back.

At the beginning of our Temtem adventure, we had every intention to review the Pokémon-inspired massively multiplayer game based on its own merit, steering clear of comparisons between the two as best we could. Developer Crema never shied away from where Temtem’s blueprints came from during its successful Kickstarter campaign and lengthy Early Access period, yet with its 1.0 release and debut on the Nintendo Switch, we naively hoped we could divorce Temtem from its muse. It only took a few hours in the Airborne Archipelago to realise how futile this would be. Of the massive mansion that Pikachu and pals built, Temtem exists as both praise and criticism, innovating, refining, and referencing a two-and-a-half-decade-old formula without shame.
Temtem’s world is made up of the six floating islands of the colourful Airborne Archipelago. Here, a professor let us choose one of three starting Temtem. Then an annoying rival picked a fight with us. Afterward, we caught more Temtem, foiled a criminal organisation’s plans, and challenged Dojo Masters. Each Temtem we caught or fought against had one or two types and abilities, and most could evolve after a certain amount of levels. If a wild Bulbasaur appeared while we were exploring the islets of Omninesia, it would’ve taken us a moment to remember which game we were playing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["We will announce the new date once it has been determined"
As you may recall, we reported six months ago that Advance Wars 1+2: Reboot Camp (a remake of Advance Wars 1 and 2 with extra features on Switch) had been delayed due to recent world events. Since then we haven't heard an official statement from Nintendo; and even during the Nintendo Direct this week, the publisher remained silent on when it may see the light of day.
That silence has been broken via a statement from a Nintendo rep, who spoke to Stephen Totilo from Axios this week. Here's their full reply:
"The release has been delayed. We will announce the new date once it has been determined."

Totilo had asked if the game had been fully canceled, which it doesn't seem to be at this time, given that it's "still delayed" as of this week. Beyond current events, Nintendo also has several considerations when it comes to determining the Advance Wars 1+2: Reboot Camp launch date. The game is fully completed, and they can stick it into any schedule lull they so choose. They could also use the opportunity of an event or stream to "re-announce" it to the world.
With that in mind, given the bevy of strategy games we're going to see on the Switch based on the Nintendo Direct presentation alone, there's plenty of other things to play in the meantime, even if Advance Wars 1+2 continues to be delayed. Strategy game fans are seeing a renaissance of sorts, and the Switch is a great fit for many titles that would have previously been relegated to handhelds.

Publisher 3goo has announced an official release date for the return of the cult fighting sequel The Rumble Fish 2 — Dimps' dystopian scrapper will launch on PC and console platforms December 8, 2022.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeB-HMEpUNk
As we've previously reported, The Rumble Fish 2 is a latter-day 2D fighter in the vein of precision examples such as Garou: Mark of the Wolves and Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike. The Rumble Fish franchise was rarely seen outside of its native Japan and, coming along so late in the advent of 3D fighters, remained in relative obscurity outside of the more dedicated fighting game fans.
This new re-release will represent the first official global release for the little-known slugfest, which depicts the tale of a gathering of off-the-wall characters, duking it out in a world devastated by the aftermath of capitalism and corporate greed. The series is renowned for its charismatic roster, boisterous audio, and trademark “S.M.A.” (Smooth Model Animation) visual style.

In addition to the release date, 3goo has also announced a physical collector's edition, which is currently only scheduled for release in Japan. This set contains a hard copy of The Rumble Fish 2, along with an artbook, soundtrack CD, strategy guide, and three additional DLC characters. It also contains a digital download of the original game, which is now exclusive to the colllector's edition. 3goo has suggested that the collector's edition will be released in the west at a later date.
The Rumble Fish 2 launches December 8 on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[More from the frontier.
Sonic Frontiers is due to release on Switch on November 8th. While that is just a few short months from now, we are still being provided with more and more footage at an alarmingly fast rate (could we really resist a speed reference?) Today's 'TGS Trailer' continues this trend with a fresh look at the game's Titan Battles, as well as a sneak preview of the yellow hedgehog, Super Sonic, in action.
We know the drill of these trailers by now. Running up walls? Check. Bounce combat? Check. Reluctance to show gameplay footage? Check. The new trailer (found above) once again consists mainly of cinematic visuals, with Sonic doing his thing in the game's 'open world' landscape, taking on huge titans by running through a series of loops to gain speed boosts - who would have thought it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At risk of turning RPS into a Ryu Ga Gotoku fansite today, I must inform you that the rumoured release of the Judgment series on PC has happened. Available now on PC through Steam, The Judgment Collection includes Judgment, its sequel Lost Judgment, and The Kaito Files story expansion all into one handy bundle. That sure is a whole lot of judgment. Watch the trailer below for more than your daily recommended dose of kick-punching action.

If you're hankering for some quick Splatoon 3 My Nintendo platinum, you've come to the right place. You can net 100 points now via the game's official site, so long as you're in the mood for a quick scavenger hunt.
Like many activities before it, the gist is that you'll be sifting through a Nintendo marketing site for hidden objects: and finding all of them will grant you 100 Platinum Points. In this case, it's little squids ("squiddos"), which are embedded throughout the various sub-pages for the game. As usual, we have all the solutions below, so you can have it done quickly.
Here's a quick cheat sheet for the Splatoon 3 My Nintendo challenge:
One squid is on the "welcome to Splatsville page" near the middle
Two squids are on the how to play page: one near the top below "battle it out online," and another near the bottom after "work together in Salmon Run"
Two squids are on the weapons and gear page: one is below "make it your own," and the other is right above "save data bonus"
That's all five! Note that there are no squids present on the "home" or "buy now" pages. Once you pick up your points, you could spend them on the new Splatoon rewards.
As a reminder, if you want physical rewards, you can find our full Platinum Point guide here, which has been updated with details on weekly missions: bookmark it for when you need quick points for a reward. A handful of points is incredibly easy to get, as that’s basically just 15 minutes with Super Mario Run, or a quick sign-on to the 3DS or Wii U 3Shop. Also remember that any shipments are bundled together, so you can pay a flat rate for multiple items instead of paying it each time. Just know that items go out of stock on My Nintendo frequently, and some are never restocked.

      <p>Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio, the team behind the popular and long-running Yakuza franchise, revealed yesterday that <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/state-of-play/2022/09/13/like-a-dragon-ishin-coming-from-yakuza-developer-next-year" target="_blank">it's remaking Like A Dragon: Ishin</a> and releasing it for the first time in the West next year. That reveal trailer looked great, but it was short and sweet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now, RGG has released a new "Ambush" trailer that showcases more than five minutes of Like A Dragon: Ishin, giving us a better look at this upcoming Yakuza spinoff. Like A Dragon: Ishin was first released on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 3 in 2014, but it never came out in the West. This new release rebuilds Like A Dragon: Ishin from the ground up, and you can check out how great it's looking&nbsp;in the trailer below:&nbsp;</p>

<p>Like A Dragon: Ishin takes place in the Late Edo Period of Japan, in the 1860s. After completing his special sword training, Sakamoto Ryoma returns to his home in Tosa, only to find conflict against a prestigious samurai. You can read more about it in our story <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/state-of-play/2022/09/13/like-a-dragon-ishin-coming-from-yakuza-developer-next-year" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>Like A Dragon: Ishin hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC in February.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>]]></summary>

Valkyrie Elysium is not exactly a new Valkyrie Profile. It’s good to go in with that initial mindset: it’s got shades of the Valkyrie franchise, but it’s a distinctly more real-time action game. In my hands-on time with the demo ahead of its release, it reminded me of modern action-RPGs way more than it did tri-Ace’s turn-based combo-stringing battles.
Developer Soleil is bringing its own mark to the Valkyrie series alongside Square Enix, and to its credit, the action made the biggest impact. It clicks into place quickly, and gives me a ton of interlinking tools to mix around and sprinkle throughout my combos. It’s this slice of the story that gives me pause, and has me wondering how the rest of Valkyrie …]]></summary>

That's why it's no surprise Ryu Ga Gotoku&nbsp;Studio is following it up with another Like A Dragon game. Check out the Like A Dragon 8 reveal trailer for yourself below:</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" frameBorder="0"  allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true" src="https://players.brightcove.net/694940074001/rydylbNsz_default/index.html?videoId=6312298197112"></iframe>

<p>As you can see, the former protagonist of Yakuza, Kazuma Kiryu, is back. He was the protagonist in the first six Yakuza games, and now he's back in Like A Dragon 8. Ichiban tells Kiryu it's Hero time – remember, he's a big fan of the Dragon Quest series which stars plenty of heroes – before the trailer cuts to both of their faces, revealing that some time has passed, with both characters looking at least a little older than when we last saw them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Like A Dragon 8 is due out PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PC sometime in 2024.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>Sony revealed a brand new story trailer for God Of War Ragnarök during today’s <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/psa/2022/09/12/playstation-state-of-play-bringing-20-minutes-of-updates-and-gameplay-tomorrow" target="_blank">State Of Play stream.</a> The video showcased otherworldly imagery, including astral jellyfish, giant dinosaur-like creatures, and notably, a pivotal scene wherein Atreus appears to usher in Fimbulwinter, the end of the world, alongside Sköll and Hati – two wolves that are the offspring of Fenrir.&nbsp;According to Norse mythology, Sköll and Hati are two wolves who exist to one day spark the beginning of Ragnarök by chasing and devouring the sun and the moon. It’s pretty clear that’s what is happening in this new trailer, but why is Atreus helping them?</p>

<p>Additionally, it seems Atreus is hiding critical information from his father, Kratos, so why is Kratos following orders from his teenage son? Why is Freya holding a sword up to Atreus’ throat in the trailer? Is she holding Atreus hostage or trying to show Kratos the same pain she suffered after her son Baldur was killed in the first game?&nbsp;The trailer creates more questions than answers, precisely what I want from pre-launch marketing.&nbsp;</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" frameBorder="0"  allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hfJ4Km46A-0" width=""></iframe>

      <p>Ryu Ga&nbsp;Gotoku Studio, the team behind the beloved Yakuza franchise, has announced Like a Dragon: Ishin.

      <p>PlayStation and Team Ninja have announced Rise of the Ronin, a new action game coming exclusively to PlayStation 5 sometime in 2024.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It was revealed during today's PlayStation State of Play, and if you're at all familiar with Team Ninja's other games, you're probably going to be into this one. It's not quite clear if it's taking up the Soulslike mantle that other Team Ninja games have (looking at you, Nioh), but there were a few gameplay sequences that showed some combat similar to From Software's hit series.&nbsp…]]></summary>

      <p>Bandai Namco has revealed Tekken 8, a new sequel in the popular and long-running fighting game franchise.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Tekken 8 was revealed in a new cinematic trailer that aired during today's PlayStation State of Play. It began with a few shots to set up the scenery before cutting to two series mainstays, Kazuya and Kazuya's son, Jin. The two duke it out in what appears to be a fair fight, that is until Kazuya calls forth the power of the devil gene inside him to finish the fight.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Check it out for yourself in the reveal trailer below:</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" frameBorder="0"  allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true" src="https://players.brightcove.net/694940074001/rydylbNsz_default/index.html?videoId=6312280170112"></iframe>

<p>Unfortunately, this trailer doesn't reveal much else. Tekken 8 looks very much like Tekken, which is great. The trailer also doesn't reveal a release date – it just says to stay tuned for more information.&nbsp;</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I only just realised, while mentioning the dev's next game, that we never posted about excellent indie horror game Mothered. Not to be confused with the unrelated Remothered games, it's the tale of a young girl returning home after surgery to find everything is weird and her mother is some sort of eerie mannequin. It might be my favourite horror game of 2021? Now's a good time to raise Mothered because: 1) it finally has a demo for newcomers; 2) for veterans, that demo actually hides a secret expansion continuing the game's story.

      <p>We're rapidly approaching the midway point for Mario Kart 8 Deluxe's Booster Course Pass content. With two of the six promised waves of new courses already out, Nintendo has begun teasing what players can expect with the third wave, which is due out this holiday season. During today's Nintendo Direct, we learned the first two courses coming in the third eight-course wave of new tracks.</p>

<p>Fittingly, the first course we learned about for Wave 3 of the Booster Course Pass is Merry Mountain. This holiday-themed track first made its debut in Mario Kart Tour in 2020 as part of the Winter Tour. Meanwhile, for those looking for something not holiday-themed, Nintendo is also bringing Peach Gardens, a track that first appeared in Mario Kart DS in 2005.</p>

<p>Wave 1 brought fan favorites like Coconut Mall (Wii), Choco Mountain (N64), and Sky Garden (GBA), while Wave 2 gave us access to tracks like Kalimari Desert (N64), Mario Circuit 3 (SNES), and Mushroom Gorge (Wii). Each wave has also given us two tracks from Mario Kart Tour, with Wave 2 also including an all-new course in Sky-High Sundae. </p>

<p>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe – Booster Course Pass Wave 3 is scheduled to arrive this holiday season. </p>]]></summary>

      <p>In the lead-up to Nintendo Switch Sports, Nintendo promised two major free updates following the launch. The first free update, which came out earlier this summer, added the ability to use the leg strap accessory for entire soccer matches instead of just shootouts. The second, more anticipated free update is set to add a new playable sport to the package: golf. Originally set for release this fall, Nintendo today announced a small delay to the update, saying it now arrives this holiday season.</p>

<p>The Nintendo Switch Sports version of golf lets you tee up across 21 holes carried over from the Wii Sports series. You can play locally with other players or hit the links with up to eight players online in the new Survival Golf mode. In Survival Golf, whoever takes the most strokes each round is eliminated.</p>

<p>This free update to Nintendo Switch Sports arrives this holiday season. For more about Nintendo Switch Sports, you can check out our full review <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/nintendo-switch-sports/par-for-the-course">here</a>.</p>]]></summary>

      <p>Ever since its summer 2019 announcement, fans have been dying to know the official name of the sequel to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.

      <p>Today's Nintendo Direct was loaded with surprises, including an enhanced port of the 2011 Wii game, Kirby's Return to Dream Land. On this colorful adventure, Kirby uses a variety of copy abilities to solve puzzles and platforming challenges. These abilities, like a sword and whip, can also be used for combat encounters. This updated version of the game also includes a new Mecha ability, which adds long-range rockets, a close-range dash, and a mighty blast to the arsenal.</p>

<p>Up to four people can play cooperatively using Joy-Cons on the same system. Multiplayer is also available in the expanded minigame collection, giving players a new challenge called Magolor's Tome Trackers.</p>

<p>Kirby's Return to Dream Land Deluxe launches exclusively on Switch on February 24, 2023. Preorders begin today.</p>]]></summary>

      <p>Capcom is bringing its best horror games to Nintendo Switch later this year via the handheld's cloud gaming capabilities. Resident Evil&nbsp;Village, Resident Evil 7: Biohazard and the recent remakes of Resident Evil 2 and 3 will all be available on the eShop before the end of 2022. While we don't know every game's exact release date, Capcom announced that Resident Evil&nbsp;Village Cloud is launching on October 28. Additionally, a free demo of Village will be available later today on the Switch eShop if you'd like to test the quality of the cloud version yourself.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This release coincides with the global launch of the Resident Evil Village Winter's Expansion, which introduces new story content surrounding the protagonist's daughter, which is also arriving on October 28. However, the expansion won't be available to play on the Nintendo Switch cloud until December 2.</p>]]></summary>

      <p>Square Enix has announced Theatrhythm Final Bar Line, the next entry in the Final Fantasy rhythm series. This first console entry in the series includes modernized visuals for the backgrounds and nearly 400 songs included in the base game.</p>

<p>The soundtrack includes favorites like "One Winged Angel," "Torn from the Heavens," "Suteki Da Ne," and plenty more. With 385 songs included in the base game, Square Enix understands it might be difficult to sort through them all, so it included a way to sort by game. The game can be enjoyed by two players locally or four players online.</p>

      <p>Nintendo has revealed when we can expect to take part in the first post-launch Splatoon 3 Splatfest, and we don't have to wait too long. That's because it's happening later this month!</p>

<p>More specifically, the first post-launch Splatfest will begin at 5 p.m. PT/8 p.m. ET, on Sept. 23 and end at 5 p.m. PT/8 p.m. ET on&nbsp;Sept. 25. As for what we'll be fighting for, you can choose to be on team Gear, Grub, of Fun (in regards to what you'd bring with you to a deserted island). It should be a great time if the pre-launch Splatfest held recently is any indication.</p>

<p><strong>Check out the Splatfest trailer for yourself below</strong>:&nbsp;</p>

      <p>On November 4, Hazelight and Electronic Arts' It Takes Two launches on Switch. This heartwarming adventure originally released in 2021 on PC and PlayStation and Xbox consoles. It received a 9.25 out of 10 <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/it-takes-two/it-takes-two-review-the-joys-and-heartbreak-of-love">review</a> from Game Informer and also won The Game Awards' 2021's Game of the Year honors.</p>

<p>It Takes Two can only be played cooperatively and can either be played on a single Switch via splitscreen or on two Switches via local wireless or online via the free friend's pass.</p>

<p>In my review of the Xbox One version, I said "It Takes Two may not be the platforming juggernaut that it aspires to be, but it more than makes up for it with its big heart, wealth in variety, and gorgeous imagery. All of its individual actions are things we’ve done in other games, but when applied to this distinct cooperative approach, they take on a whole new life and are used in wonderful ways over a long adventure. The action will have you laughing and screaming at your TV, and the story stays strong throughout, creating the backbone for an entertaining adventure that roars with excitement and should keep you glued to the controller to see if this couple’s lost love can be rekindled."</p>

<p>Preoders for the Switch version begin today.</p>]]></summary>

      <p>Nintendo has revealed Octopath Traveler II, a sequel to 2018's Octopath Sequel, and it's out next year.</p>

<p>The first game in the series, Octopath Traveler, was released exclusively on Switch in 2018 before making its way to PC the following year, Stadia in 2020, and finally, Xbox One in 2021. It seems Nintendo is ready to take us back to that world and its excellent HD-2D visual style because it announced Octopath Traveler II is coming to Switch February 24, 2023.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>Developer Platinum Games and publisher Square Enix have revealed that Babylon's Fall will shut down next year, less than a full year after its March 3 launch this year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>More specifically, Platinum Games will terminate the game's service on February 27, 2023. As for why, the team didn't really outline the reason but it's likely due to the game's poorly received launch and its lack of players since then.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Troubled live-service action RPG Babylon’s Fall will close its doors on February 28th 2023, Square Enix and developers Platinum Games have revealed today. The game had struggled to make an impact since its launch on March 3rd earlier this year, with concurrent player counts dropping to zero at times. It hadn't looked good from the early days when, as we pointed out, Platinum Games were tweeting statements that Babylon’s Fall’s wasn’t "in danger" just two weeks following its launch.

A succession of missed notes whizzing past sounds like an ode to my failure, and in mashups that mix demanding rhythms with another genre - like Crypt Of The Necrodancer, say - these reminders of my musical inadequacy often drown out even the simplest pleasures.

      <p>Hot on the heels of <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/psa/2022/09/12/nintendo-direct-announced-for-tomorrow-will-be-mostly-focused-on-games-coming-this">the announcement of a long-awaited Nintendo Direct</a>, PlayStation announced that tomorrow will also feature a special livestreamed presentation of its own. Now, in addition to that aforementioned Nintendo Direct tomorrow morning, we're now also receiving a PlayStation State of Play stream in the afternoon.</p>

<p>The news comes as Tokyo Game Show looms, giving publishers a massive convention to piggyback off of. According to PlayStation, tomorrow's show will feature updates from some of the company's Japanese partners, as well as surprises from developers all around the world. Tomorrow's presentation is set to last approximately 20 minutes and will feature new updates and gameplay footage from 10 games across PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation VR2.</p>

<p>This PlayStation State of Play stream is set for tomorrow, September 13 at 3 p.m. Pacific/6 p.m. Eastern. You can watch it live on PlayStation's <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/playstation" target="_blank">Twitch</a> and <a href="http://youtube.com/playstation" target="_blank">YouTube</a> channels. Of course, if you miss the show, we'll have all the biggest announcements covered right here on <em>Game Informer</em>.</p>]]></summary>

      <p>Following the launch of PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, multiple&nbsp;video game publishers bumped up the price of new-gen versions of some of their games. While Ubisoft resisted that trend to this point, CEO Yves Guillemot tells&nbsp;<em>Axios</em>&nbsp;in an exclusive interview that it is making $70 the standard price for bigger triple-A experiences published by the company.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We already knew that the new-gen versions of Ubisoft's long-in-development pirate game,&nbsp;Skull and Bones,&nbsp;would retail for $70, but now it appears to be the start …]]></summary>

      <p>When Danny Peña was a child, he would spend hours playing games at his local New York arcade before he received his first console, an Atari 2600, from his grandmother. Peña knew early on that he wanted to do something in the games industry, but he didn't know what. All along the way, he was told that video games won't pay the bills, but he didn't let that deter him. Flash forward a couple of decades, and Peña returned to New York to show his mother a billboard featuring his face in Times Square – a monument to his success in the games industry, but not one that was e…]]></summary>

We’re still quite a way off from then, but Sony have released a smattering more gameplay footage today, detailing the moves you'll be pulling as heroine Frey "I'm seeing freaking dragons" Holland. Alas, said footage has been crushed down to only a handful of GIFs over on the PlayStation Blog, but our friends at Eurogamer have a bigger, chunkier hands on preview that tells us more about why it won't be mega cringe. Alas, we weren't privy to this Forspoken demo, so have a watch with us below.

Talking to devs especially is a wonderful thing, especially when you're playing their game and it resonates with you. But getting hands-on with an early portion of American Arcadia rendered me virtually silent, to the point where I had to apologise to the devs for being so quiet.
And I wasn't being rude; far from it! I was just so engrossed in the game's mixture of side-scrolling platforming and first-person puzzling. Keep this under surveillance, because I think it's going to be a real hit when it lands.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gloomwood is, so far, a very good game, but it is also not much of a game - in the literal sense that it has launched into early access incomplete. There's currently just enough of it to play that it makes you feel both bereft and quite annoyed when it suddenly clangs its great iron doors shut in front of you. "Let me in!!" you scream, as you hammer on the silent portal. "I really like Thief! I get you! I want to throw more decapitated heads as lures!"
If you are one of those people who bases their gaming personality on liking the original Thief series, Gloomwood will have been on your radar for a while. It's a grimy, steampunk-ish stealth immersive sim with a deliberate low-poly vibe, and it picks up the abandoned Thief football to absolutely run with it. But, though the current EA build is but short, it feels like Gloomwood is aiming to punt that ball into outer space. There's so much more room to be playful and experiment than I expected, and it's so much fun that if you'd never played a stealth sim in your life I'd recommend Gloomwood. Except I wouldn't, because it feels like I'd be doing you a disservice to recommend it now, when the fun will be so quickly snatched away.

I suspect it's probably a similar experience to watching the carnage of Chivalry II play out from the safety of a nearby bench. The newly announced Warlander from Nier Replicant devs Toylogic certainly has the medieval setting in common with Torn Banner Studio's first-person hack and slash, but this free-to-play multiplayer warfare game is an altogether different beast. You control your warriors in third-person, for starters, and its more cartoonish visuals allow for, well, daft cataclysmic events like a flaming meteor shower to hone in on a player's position without appearing completely over the top. As it prepares to enter its first open beta later today, September 12th, I went hands on with a brief demo build to see what it was all about.

For the current-flagship Intel Xeon Platinum 8380 "Ice Lake" processors, Ubuntu 22.10 does deliver some performance advantages over the current Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS release. However, Ubuntu 22.10 still trails in a distance behind Intel's own Clear Linux platform for the most aggressive out-of-the-box performance.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["Oh, come on!" is a phrase you hear a lot in Sunday Gold. It's often uttered by your knuckle-dusting healer Sally, and is invariably followed up by, "You havin' a laugh, mate?" and "Facking hell!" - partly because Sally is from Laaaandan and is thus obligated to speak lik' tha', innit (because how else would you know this is a game set in Laaaandan), but also because the thugs, security guards and cybernetic dogs she's often fighting in this seedy tale of corporate dystopia are some of the most frustrating enemies known to video games. The type who are seemingly resistant to every single weapon type in your arsenal, or who invariably have big, scripted healing sequences just when you're about to nail 'em. 
It's a phrase I often found myself echoing while playing Sunday Gold for review, too, both during its tedious, war of attrition-style turn-based battles, and while trying to figure out some of its more obtuse puzzles. BKOM Studios have tried to fuse one too many things together in Sunday Gold, and the result is a messy, somewhat artificial blend of Deathloop's style, Invisible Inc's tension and a more action-led focus on the cerebral role-playing of Disco Elysium. There's still much to admire in its stylish visuals and atmospheric music, but I also haven't been this cross playing a video game since Felix The Reaper, and that's saying something.

Now, it seems, the French publishers are hoping that plonking in some indie games among its multitudes of Assassin’s Creeds and Tom Clancy shooters will attract a more varied clientele. They’re also running a free trial period for Ubisoft+ until October 10th, including for lapsed subscribers, so that’s something.

      <p>Nintendo has revealed that it will livestream a Nintendo Direct tomorrow.</p>

<p>More specifically, the Direct will begin at 7 a.m. PT/10 a.m. ET tomorrow, Sept. 13, and it will run for roughly 40 minutes. That's one of the largest Directs of the year, so it will likely be jam-packed with new looks at previously announced games and new ones, too (perhaps a Zelda port or two, if rumors about this Direct are correct). As for what to expect, Nintendo says the Direct will "mostly" focus on Switch games launching this Winter.&nbsp;</p>

Squeenix have teamed with blockchain company Oasys, who describe themselves as “environmentally-friendly”. This is because of their less energy-intensive “proof-of-stake” mechanism compared to “proof-of-work” methods such as those used in Bitcoin mining. Oasys's plans fits with Squeenix’s intention to develop tokenised economies built on blockchain in their future games.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Valve have opened repair centres for the Steam Deck. These are where you'll send your handheld PC if it develops a problem, either so Valve can fix it free-of-charge if it's still under warranty, or so they can diagnose the problem and quote you a repair price if it's not. "If your dog gnaws on your thumbstick and breaks it, this is not covered by warranty," say Valve.

      <p>Today's Ubisoft Forward was mostly about Assassin's Creed, and it had a lot&nbsp;to talk about. There were new games announced, further details about Mirage released, and so much more.&nbsp;</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As was leaked, and then hurriedly confirmed by Ubisoft about a week ago, the next Assassin's Creed game to come out will be Mirage, in 2023. It's not going to be quite the massive open world adventure 'em up that the last few entries have been (don't worry; one of those is on the way as well), but a more classic AssCreed experience to mark the series' 15th anniversary. This milestone has made me realise that the Creedsperience has taken up almost half of my current lifespan. Or, to put it another way, I fear that playing Assassin's Creed Mirage may induce a pathetic but very real existential crisis in me.

To celebrate the doughty action-adventure's 15th anniversary, senior community developer Alice Terrett was joined by a, to his credit, very excited Danny "it's the Daddy" Wallace, to lay out an almost MCU-like timeline of every Assassin's Creed thing happening for the next good while. It includes new DLC for Valhalla, and a mysterious horror-ish tease. But top of the list, after next year's more trad and compact Assassin's Creed Mirage, is Assassin's Creed: Codename Red, the next big flagship open-world RPG for the series. And it's set in feudal Japan.

The suggestion that Assassin's Creed might become a live service online game akin to Fortnite was quite upsetting to me. Thankfully, VP executive producer on Assassin's Creed Marc-Alexis Côté (aka MAC) appeared on tonight's Ubisoft Forward livestream to explain more about Infinity, and I am slightly less alarmed but no less confused. Rather than a game, MAC says that Infinity is "going to be the single entry point for our fans into the Assassin's Creed franchise in the future".

      <p>Ubisoft and Netflix have announced an expansion of their partnership that was first announced in 2020 with a live-action Assassin's Creed series that is still on the way and the <em>Rabbids Invasion: Mission to Mars</em> movie that arrived on the service earlier this year. Today, we learned that Netflix subscribers will have exclusive access to three upcoming Ubisoft mobile games as a part of their existing memberships, with no ads or microtransactions. This announcement comes as Netflix prepares to enter the gaming space with its first releases later this year.</p>

<p>First up, is a sequel to Valiant Hearts, a World War I puzzle-adventure. This new title is in development by the team behind the first game and will bring a new story exclusively to Netflix members in January 2023. That same year, a sequel to Mighty Quest, the roguelite hack and slash, will arrive for subscribers. Finally, Ubisoft is currently working on a new, original Assassin's Creed mobile title, which, again, will be available exclusively to Netflix subscribers.</p>

<p>In addition to the Assassin's Creed live-action series, Ubisoft and Netflix are currently collaborating on three animated series: <i>Captain Laserhawk: Blood Dragon Remix</i>,&nbsp;<em>Far Cry</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Splinter Cell</em>. While Netflix is set to enter the games industry later this year, we'll have to wait until at least next year to experience these three new mobile titles for Netflix subscribers.</p>]]></summary>

      <p>During today's Ubisoft Forward presentation, the publisher showed off new footage of a boss battle in Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope. The crossover game, which combines the iconic Mushroom Kingdom crew with the zany Rabbids, looks to expand in the first 2017 turn-based tactical game in the series, Kingdom Battle, in myriad ways, including the new Sparks that can add various buffs to the heroes and debuffs to the villains.</p>

<p>This time around, we got a look at battles on a train, including Bowser joining the team. The battle takes place on the train as the crew tries to cleanse an angered Wiggler of corrupted darkness eyes as it runs alongside the train. Ubisoft also announced that it has post-launch plans including free DLC with the third content drop introducing a new playable hero: Rayman.</p>

      <p>In the world of Marvel Comics, the word "ensemble" invokes thoughts of the Avengers, X-Men, or Fantastic Four. Recently, we learned Skydance New Media and Marvel Entertainment were working on an ensemble Marvel video game. The internet's rumor mill believed this game would focus on Reed Richards and his fantastic family. Yesterday, during the Disney &amp; Marvel Games Showcase, we learned this ensemble wasn't Fantastic Four, Avengers, or any known Marvel team whatsoever. Skydance is creating its own team of four heroes, set to the backdrop of World War II.</p>

As was leaked, it's about Captain America and Black Panther working to fight against Hydra during World War 2. What I didn't expect at all was that the game still wouldn't have a name, although there are a few other details to glean from the most teasery teaser trailer.

      <p>During today's Disney &amp; Marvel Games Showcase at the D23 Expo, we got a look at the first game from Skydance New Media. While we didn't get a name or release date, we did get a cinematic trailer from which we can try to extract information. The biggest news right out of the gate is that this game stars Black Panther, Captain America, and two additional heroes.</p>

      <p><em>Gargoyles</em> is&nbsp;back! Well, sort of. The 1995 Sega Genesis side-scroller based on the beloved 90’s animated series is getting the remaster treatment, bringing Goliath and his team (much to their chagrin) back into the spotlight.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the reveal didn’t come alongside a trailer, a list of platforms, or a release window. However, it sounds like we should expect a similar&nbsp;treatment that the <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2021/09/23/the-expanded-disney-classic-games-collection-includes-the-jungle-book-and-snes-aladdin" target="_blank">Disney Classics Games Collection</a> received. Those games were enhanced with high-res graphics, a rewind ability, a level skip, and art galleries showcasing concept sketches and other historical goodies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You can see the announcement at the 12:33 mark.</p>

Like everything, it's also a roguelike, but it's transparent and fair enough that I can reluctantly forgive that too, not least because I've found myself enjoying this one the more it went on. It's a lighter, cheerier sibling of Into The Breach that's half tactical fighter, half puzzler, and its default difficulty setting is close to perfect if you're looking for something less intense that will still catch you out now and then.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Despite lamenting the other week that the rest of 2022's gaming calendar was looking a bit weak sauce after endless delay announcements, September is shaping up to be an absolutely monster month for indie releases right now. As Alice Bee noted earlier in the week, there are just too many cool, interesting games coming out for us to review effectively on the site at the moment (although rest assured, we will do our darnedest to cover as many of them as we can).
Part of the challenge is working out what's worth reviewing, and what we think is worth highlighting for you, our readers. The other part, though, is often entirely selfish on our part, just playing and writing about cool games we like. In fact, the decision to review many of the games we covered this week - Railbound, Jack Move and Roadwarden - were all down to having played and liked some form of demo, making events like the Steam Next Fest an increasingly invaluable tool in helping us cut through the noise when we inevitably enter mega months like September.

Likewise, Crystal Dynamics say they have taken "control" of its Tomb Raider and Legacy Of Kain games from their previous owner, Square Enix.

Which sounds like a big deal, but really both studios are just reporting a change to their terms of service and privacy notices since they were bought by Embracer Group last month.

Because that's how I feel about Phoenix Point after the last few months of playing it on and off. I’ve definitely enjoyed it more than on its release in 2019, and its DLC adds more to think about and manage during what were once long lull periods. There's a lot to like about its final form. There's also a lot to... I don't quite want to say hate, but I'm also not quite sure why. It's one of the most evenly mixed bags I've ever rummaged around in.

I do spend quite a lot of time explaining Blackbird to Nate, but after that we do talk about some cutscenes and cinematics in games (as well as litigating the difference between the two, and Nate tries to remember the first time he saw a cutscene in a game that was in-engine rather than being pre-rendered). And today the Cavern Of Lies is a Cavern Of Justice, after we received a troubling missive from one [squints] Brond Coatwear?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I saw a panel of thriller authors a couple of months back and one of them made reference to "the fat chapter", and the others all went "Ohhhh, yes, the fat chapter!". Thriller writers deal in short, snappy chapters, and the fat chapter is the one that ends up getting a load of events or exposition shoved into it, somewhere in the second half, because they wouldn't fit anywhere else. Every year in games there's a fat month, where loads of games come out and loads of them look really good and there is never enough time godammit.
This year that month is September. There are so many games out this month that look so much my jam that I want to spread 'em on my morning toast, but September is also the month that a lot of RPS staff have holiday booked - including me, for two weeks, which means that if these games do get reviewed it probably won't be by me. But know that I have my beady little eyes on 'em.

We didn’t beat around the bush when it entered early access back in 2020 - Cian Maher called it the best Pokemon game in years - and I won’t beat around the bush now. It’s still the best Pokemon game in years. It borrows so much from Nintendo's behemoth, but it also takes some much-needed lessons that Game Freak fails to recognise, taking the formula to its highest evolution yet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It cannot be a coincidence that 1997 is a pivotal year in the world of Jack Move. In the game, it's the year everything went dark in this turn-based Japanese-style RPG, with a solar storm biffing the world's electronics. It threw the world into chaos, giving rise to the megacorps that now control the dystopian cyberpunk society where our heroine Noa is trying to make a living. In the real world, of course, 1997 was the year Final Fantasy VII came out, the seminal JRPG that Jack Move owes a great deal to (right down to its menu plink plink sound). Developers So Romantic have said outright that it's been one of the main inspirations for Jack Move, and its shady corporate powers and grungy urban landscape certainly feel of a piece with ShinRa's grip on the city of Midgar. 
But the bigwigs at MonoMind aren't out to poison the world and suck the life from it in Jack Move. Instead, they're more concerned with using their newfound technological powers to find eternal life – a classic 'upload your mind to the metaverse' kind of tale you'll probably recognise if you've read any of the cyberpunk 101 novels such as William Gibson's Neuromancer or Permutation City by Greg Egan. Jack Move's story doesn't tread any new ground in this respect, but Noa and her hacker pal Ryder are a fiery spirited pair that make this six-hour tale of espionage and rebellion against its cartoonish villain well worth dipping into. Yes, you read that correctly. A JRPG you can polish off in a single day of play. Bliss.

Sure, I saw the main sights and had a great time soaking in the ambiance, but I know that I missed so many hidden gems. I want to go back and explore, maybe this time with a local guide who knows its secrets.
At its most basic, Roadwarden is a text-based RPG. You play as the titular roadwarden, who sets out from the city to investigate an unmapped peninsula with little more than their horse for company. Your goal as set by the people who sent you is to investigate the region and report your findings in preparation for the expansion of trade guilds in the area. But you can also set your own goal, shaping your character’s approach from the start in a way that helps with roleplaying a particular kind of adventurer throughout. And once you get to that adventuring, dozens of sidequests open up covering everything from gathering fruit to curing the plague.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Every corner of Skyrim houses a locked chest, but where are all the keys? Only a handful actually have keys to open them. So do the chest's owners lockpick them every time they want an apple or knife? Are these chests merely decorative, their contents deemed inaccessible and long forgotten? A new mod for Skyrim Special Edition answers this playfully by adding a load of hidden keys to unlock these chests. Some of the keys look quite well hidden in this object hunt, so you'll need to poke around, rummage, and turn things over.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When we last saw Amicia and Hugo de Rune at the end of A Plague Tale: Innocence back in 2019, things were looking up for the orphaned rat wranglers. They'd escaped the clutches of the French Inquisition and the hordes of plague rats following in their wake, and the pair were hopeful about finding a cure for the cursed macula flowing through Hugo's veins.
Alas, when I pick up their journey in chapter six of Asobo's upcoming sequel, A Plague Tale: Requiem, Amicia is having a particularly terrible time of it. Not only is she suffering from an open head wound, leaving her unsteady on her feet, but rumours are flying in the nearby pilgrim camp about something bad having gone down in the last city they passed through. Exactly what is hard to say with five chapters' worth of context missing from my preview build, but the pack of guards who are hot on the siblings' trail quickly make it plain: several men died back in that city, and they're pointing the finger squarely at Amicia's knife, slingshot and crossbow.

Ian Hitman’s turn in the two films released about his adventures has been rougher to recommend, though. That’s why it’s simultaneously disappointing and awesome to learn that Guardians Of The Galaxy, The Suicide Squad and – shudder – Slither director James Gunn narrowly missed his target when he pitched a Hitman movie.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Third person skater shooter Rollerdrome has some really cool weapons, but what is it that makes them so special? I mean, there’s only four of them, and you’re forced to constantly perform tricks to regain ammo, which doesn't make them easy to use. I think it’s because of their more literal significance in the game. Rollerdrome threatens you with multiple enemy types called Houseplayers, all formidable, especially in the heat of battle when they combine their efforts. Luckily, the four distinct weapons you’re equipped with act as an equaliser; each weapon is a solution for a particular enemy. Developers Roll7 could have easily added a bunch of copied and pasted guns from every generic shooter, but instead they were more intentional about the weapons they included, with each weapon complimenting the gunplay and the game as a whole.

In it, we're whisked to an alternative history where King Louis XVI stopped the French Revolution before it properly got going by, err, killing everyone with steampunk robots. You're Aegis, a feminine robot created to entertain and protect Queen Marie Antoinette. Marie, safe outside Paris but somewhat peeved at her husband's new penchant for extreme mass murder, sends you on a Soulslike mission to sort it all out.
This takes some doing, but luckily Aegis is a very advanced robot, the bestest of all the robots. Slight but adaptive with it, and even having an advanced AI, Aegis can carve a swift path through the more than usually twisted metal in her way. It's a bit too easy, in fact.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Soldier Boyz is the newest supported game of the Hypno engine, and it’s ready for public testing!
Released in 1997 by Hypnotix and published by DreamCatcher Interactive and MCPA Interactive, this full-motion rail shooter is based on the 1995 film of the same name. The game starts when the daughter of an American billionaire is kidnapped by a group of Vietnamese terrorists. Then, it’s up to Major Howard Toliver, ex-Marine and highly decorated Vietnam veteran, to gather a deadly team for the dangerous mission of rescuing her. He recruits six prison inmates serving life sentences for a chance at a full presidential pardon.
Keep the body count rising to survive five territories by playing as each Soldier Boy (and Girl),
but beware and don’t waste a “friendly” since they provide vital survival information!
ScummVM currently supports the English release of the game (which is the only one we know about) and features more responsive controls than the original. We couldn't find a demo but there is a trailer. Please contact us if you have a demo or any other release.
To play the game with ScummVM, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker.
