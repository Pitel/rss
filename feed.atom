        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Trend Spotting.
Nintendo isn't always the easiest company to predict, but things are usually pretty routine when it comes to Direct Showcases. There's usually one in February, usually one in the summer and usually one in September — plus a handful of Indie Worlds, Partner Showcases or game-specific presentations thrown in for good measure.
We're in September now (almost halfway through, even) and an event is still yet to be announced (at the time of writing, that is), so there's only one thing for it: let the speculation begin.

Update : Enchanted Portals will now be releasing "a few weeks later" alongside the PS4 and Xbox One versions of the game, developer Xixo Games Studio has revealed on Twitter.
The Cuphead-inspired title was originally meant to be released on Switch last week, on 6th September, but given how packed the last few months have been, the delay totally slipped by us and many others until we spotted a report by Nintendo Everything.

In 2021, Gearbox Entertainment was acquired by Embracer for an eye-watering $1.3 billion. Despite the pricey purchase, it seems not all is well, and a report from Reuters claims that Embracer is considering its options with Gearbox.
Reuters, citing three people familiar with the matter, states that the involved parties are working with Goldman Sachs and Aream & Co to explore a possible sale, and this comes after Embracer received interest from third parties. This is certainly big news, but it's not entirely a surprise, as Embracer had previously made it known that the company is undergoing drastic changes.
In June, the company released an open letter explaining that it is aiming to shift from a "heavy-investment-mo…]]></summary>

After all, the first notable balance patch for Elden Ring hit after roughly the same amount of time. For Armored Core 6, FromSoftware has released a new patch to seemingly address some of the bigger talking points that the game has seen since release. It buffs a variety of weapons while adjusting "certain attacks” performed by a few bosses.
Among the boss names listed here is Balteus, who has already developed a fierce reputation. After a string of relatively easy missions in Chapter 1, Balteus shows up as an abrupt difficulty spike. For players still trying to learn the game's core mechanics, this fight can grind progress to a halt. While the patch notes don’t specifically …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hitting pause in a video game is like dropping a wall across it. On one side of the wall lies what is called the diegetic space of the game, aka the fictitious world, which is generally the aspect that receives the most interest, the aspect that tends to attract the weasel word "immersive". On the other side of the wall lie menus, settings and other features that form a non-diegetic layer of bald operator functions - technical conveniences and lists of things to tweak or customise, from graphics modes to character inventory, that are cut adrift in a vacuum outside of time. 


In theory, the pause screen and its contents are not truly part of the game. There is no temporality, no sense of place, no threat, no possibility of play, no character or narrative, no save the princess, no press X to Jason or pay respects, no gather your party before travelling forth. As the scholar Madison Schmalzer points out in the paper I'm wonkily paraphrasing here, "the language of the menu itself emphasizes the menu's position as outside of gameplay by labeling the option to continue as 'resume game.' The game world is always privileged as the site that gameplay happens."

When the director Todd Howard was asked about these issues, he responded in a way that some might say was tone-deaf. Notably, he said that Starfield was optimized and that some PC gamers might simply need to upgrade their rigs for it to run properly. A bold statement, to be sure, but one that may also ring hollow following some strange discoveries from the open-source community.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the biggest draws about Starfield is the number of planets you can explore. It's not so much an open-world game as it is more of an open-galaxy title. With that, you might understandably want these giant balls of rock to look their best. That's where the modding community comes into its own.
You see, while Starfield's planets do look pretty good, especially from low orbit, they evidently could stand to look prettier. That's why Nexus Mods user Revan (as spotted by DSO Gaming) has brought us their texture pack for a visual boost to some of the game's planets.
[caption id="attachment_403598" align="aligncenter" width="640"] Image via Revan/Nexus Mods.[/caption]
Upscaling the vanilla look to 8K, this mod aims to give a more "realistic" look to these potential homesteads. At the moment, textures focus on the Sol System, which includes Earth, Earth's moon, Mars, Venus, and Jupiter. Revan is also upscaling the other "biomemasks" planets, with 90 of 555 done so far. The mod will be updated with more textures as they go along.
Console mod support inbound
Already, Starfield modders have been keeping themselves busy, and there are plenty being released all the time. In a more official capacity, Todd Howard recently confirmed the game would be getting Creation Kit mod support in 2024. This means that custom content for the Xbox Series X|S version of the game will be on the horizon.
Going down as the biggest launch in Bethesda's history, Starfield is a product several years in the making. From Howard's initial pitch back in 2013 to the release of the finished product just recently, it seems as though the hype has been worth it for the most part.

This is according to a new ESRB rating that popped up, which added Switch as a platform to its listing. Note that ESRB ratings don't usually apply to Switch cloud-based games, so in all likelihood, this is a legitimate port. We've reached out to WB for clarification.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If there's one thing that can be said about Skyrim, it's that it at least has longevity. That; and the fact that it's one of the most successful RPGs in recent memory. Part of the reason it's still going strong after 12 years is due to the modding community. The Elder Scrolls 5 has so many mods, including this recent one for all you Garret-from-Thief wannabees.
Over on Nexus Mods, user Elsawirr has uploaded "Immersive Carcass Carrying." As you can guess from the name, this is a way of allowing you to carry those dead bodies that you "find" in Tamriel. This is actually based on a previous mod they made that did the same thing. However, it's now been improved upon with new animations and the removal of the "carry weight penalty."

A quick video shows it in action, with the Dragonborn seen carrying a dead moose over their shoulder. Indeed, it does look more immersive as they stroll through Whiterun and wait patiently in line at one of the food stalls. Very RDR2.
Skyrim: a different beast these days
In this modern gaming era, it's not uncommon for people to poo-poo the vanilla version of TES5. With so many custom mods to download – especially on PC – many players prefer to tinker with Bethesda's epic RPG. While some are just there to tweak the gameplay, others (such as this one) improve the overall immersion. Then there are those that are just kind of out there and wild. You know the ones.
At any rate, Skyrim is still kicking it more than a decade after its release. Other games can only dream of being in the limelight for this length of time. Now, we just need to see whether Starfield can boast as big a legacy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since Dead by Daylight released in 2016, we've seen so many horror crossovers. The most recent one was when the Xenomorph from Alien was incorporated into the asymmetrical survival game. Now, developer Behaviour Interactive seems eager to join up with the Five Nights universe.
In a recent Reddit AMA conducted by the studio (as spotted by The Gamer), several members of the team take turns to answer some burning questions from fans. One of them comes from user NasserMX who asks whether Five Nights at Freddy's will ever make its way to Dead by Daylight.
https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/16cjy36/comment/jzjqfmy/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3
While the answer isn't a definitive yes or no, Behaviour's own Senior Creative Director, Dave Richard, says to "never say never!" Not much can be read from this statement, but a few Reddit users posting below seem excited about the possibility of the two franchises coming together.
Imagine running away from The Puppet
Since time immemorial (well...seven years ago), Dead by Daylight has made a name for itself with numerous crossovers. We've seen Silent Hill's Pyramid Head, Freddy Krueger, Bill from Left 4 Dead, Resident Evil 3's Nemesis, and more horror villains make an appearance.
We obviously don't know whether the team will bring the creepy animatronics from Five Nights at Freddy's over. However, it does sound like the studio is keen on the idea. The smash hit spooky series is still going, though it's not as popular as it once was. A film adaptation of FNaF is currently in the pipeline and due to release October 27.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I didn't need to play much of Mario Kart Tour to find out it's not for me: but even if you're still enjoying it, the race is coming to an end in the near future. According to a new in-game notification straight from Nintendo (via OatmealDome), new content for Mario Kart Tour will cease to come out from October 4, 2023 onward.
Here's the full wording from Nintendo:
"From 10/04/2023 (Wed) on, tours will consist of content from tours that have appeared before. Note: No new courses, drivers, karts, or gliders will be added following the Battle Tour starting 10/04/2023 (Wed). We hope you continue to enjoy playing Mario Kart Tour."

Well, that's pretty definitive! I love how Nintendo clarified "courses, drivers, karts, or gliders" just to let folks know that there is no hope of new content coming to the game post-October. This is just a few weeks following the fourth anniversary of the game's release on September 25, 2019.
Mario Kart 8 Deluxe will carry on the legacy of Mario Kart Tour's few bright spots
Funnily enough, a good chunk of the game's courses have already been ported over to Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, so even when the microtransaction-filled game goes offline entirely, its legacy will still live on in some form. Even though it kicked off years ago, it's still so weird to see Nintendo getting into the mobile game with gacha fodder and loot boxes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There was a time back in my school days when cardgames were all the rage. Everybody had a deck of playing cards in their pocket for cheeky 15 minute rounds of Texas Hold 'Em between lessons, with Milky Way segments and Niknaks wagered in place of chips. Yes, I'm aware I'm starting to sound like Grandpa Simpson, and no, this wasn't from some murky era before the invention of videogames. It was the heyday of the Gameboy Advance! I'm not sure what we were thinking. But two things: 1) decks of playing cards are cheaper than game consoles, and 2) part of the fun, possibly, was that nobody really knew how to play the ostensibly well-known cardgames we were playing.
With the benefit of hindsight, I suspect there may have been creative liberties taken with the rules at times. I knew hair-pulling wasn't a legal move in professional poker. Anyway, I'm reminded of all this by Dungeons & Degenerate Gamblers, a warped and mildly satirical, 90s-styled take on Blackjack from Purple Moss Collectors.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Zero to hero.
Though Capcom hasn’t necessarily abandoned the Mega Man brand as a whole, it’s indisputably reduced how often it produces new games in that celebrated franchise. For example, it’s been 19 years since the last new Mega Man X release (and let’s be real, X8 was a rough entry to end on), but that series now lives on in the efforts of its fans. A few years ago, Battery Staple Games released 20XX, a cute roguelite take on Mega Man gameplay, and now it’s followed up that effort with 30XX. It isn’t without issues, but we’re happy to report that 30XX feels like an overall improvement over its predecessor, and stands as a worthy homage to a beloved series.
Gameplay in 30XX follows the template of classic Mega Man X. You run ‘n’ gun through eight themed levels capped off with a tough boss fight, collecting new weapons or abilities each time you beat another boss, then challenge some extra tough final stages. The gimmick here, however, is that 30XX is structured like a roguelite, so each stage is different each run and there are myriad upgrades you can collect along the way to help even the odds a little bit. There are two playable characters, named Ace and Nina, and they take after Zero and X, respectively. Both have their pros and cons, though we generally preferred Nina’s ranged gameplay over Ace’s sword-swinging skills.

If you are after a dose of retro arcade simplicity, then you might want to check out Raindrop Sprinters, a fixed-screen action game that snuck its way onto the Switch eShop last week.
The title comes from solo developer Shuhei Miyazawa (Room_909) and publisher Mediascape and sees you attempting to guide a cat across a series of passages while avoiding the falling rain. It's a simple premise with a classic visual style (the game is even playable in the Switch's oft-underused Tate Mode) but there seems to be a good level of reward to be had here, with riskier manoeuvres resulting in more points.

This week's UK charts are here, and it's a strangely quiet one for Nintendo this time around as big offerings from Sony and Microsoft's consoles lead the pack.
On the Nintendo front, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe has managed to keep up with the newbies as it continues to hold onto third place (seriously, who doesn't have this game by now?) and The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom continues to perform well as it lands in sixth. There's also the brand-new appearance of Fae Farm, which makes its debut in the charts at number 9.

People are already modding Starfield, of course - the options range from "Potato Mode" functionality for lower-spec computers, through somewhat controversial Starfield DLSS mods, to the all-important Starfield script extender, which lets other modders add "scripting capabilities and functionality" to the game. But Bethesda have yet to release proper in-house tools, aka Creation Kit 2.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There was plenty of excitement when a S.T.A.L.K.E.R. sequel was announced by GSC Game World. Nobody could have predicted just how tumultuous the development cycle would be. The game has faced numerous delays due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine which forced the team to quickly relocate from Kyiv to Prague.
This was far from the end of their problems, as they would also suffer cyber attacks originating from Russia. Because of all these hurdles, the game's release date has shifted to 2024. It appears that a new kind of problem has appeared, this time in the form of fire.
It was originally reported by the Czech publication Vortex on September 8 that GSC Game World had suffered a fire in their offices. According to PC Gamer, nobody was hurt in the fire, and a GSC representative has confirmed that the incident is under investigation.
[caption id="attachment_403508" align="alignnone" width="640"] Image via GSC Game World.[/caption]
Battered but not beaten
In its official Discord server, the studio confirmed a few more details about the fire, including that although the fire was quickly put out, an office floor will need full restoration. Despite the setback, developers remain intent on releasing S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2, and their confidence is motivated by the fact that they've "dealt with worse than that before."
It's certainly a true statement, as despite escaping a warzone, developers have been able to present a playable demo at this year's Gamescom. Although GSC Game World has attempted to defend the demo's "imperfect" state, the reception to it has been relatively good.

The delivery is more direct than most works coming out of FromSoftware since its games often keep the surface narrative light. Armored Core has always been this way, even if the latest entry is more dialogue-focused than its predecessors.

Until Creation Kit 2 - built specifically for Starfield's Creation Engine 2 - comes out, modders won't be able to easily add new weapons, customizations, and other assorted goodies into the game, but the good news is that it's bound to happen relatively soon!

There are also a metric ton of games based on anime — My Hero One’s Justice, One Piece Odyssey, and Dragon Ball FighterZ, to name three. On the flip side, there are even more anime based on games — the recently released Nier Automata adaptation, Persona 5: The Animation, and Doll’s/Girl’s Frontline.
It’s a fool’s errand to say the two media are not connected. But what if we were given an infinite budget and told to name ten characters from anime who would receive their own game?

It turns out that at the end of last month, the collection was also updated for both the Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4. Each game has apparently had some improvements and bug fixes. Unfortunately, the notes don't go into detail about what has specifically changed, but at the very least each game has been updated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Roblox has a firm grip on the gaming world thanks to a few key elements that have helped it attract millions of players. For instance, it's a small game that isn't going to tax even the most dated PCs. Furthermore, it also has strong social elements, allowing players from around the world to use it as a virtual hangout spot.
A recent blog post from Roblox outlined some of the revelations from the Roblox Developers Conference (RDC) which took place in San Francisco. Developers plan to continue making Roblox one of the best places for friends to communicate and play together. The game will also be expanding its reach when it finally launches on PS4 and PS5 in October.
This is a long-awaited port, as Roblox has conspicuously not been available in the Nintendo and PlayStation ecosystems despite its popularity. Currently, the game supports crossplay, though it hasn't been confirmed yet whether the PlayStation ports will also have crossplay capabilities.

What to expect from Roblox in 2023 and beyond
Roblox will be making things a little easier for creators and giving them more freedom. New mesh and texture APIs will be added, allowing you to edit your avatar and avatar items such as clothes within an experience. Developers also intend to craft tools that enable users to create avatars from text inputs.
Later this year, Roblox Connect will also launch. In a bid to further expand the game's available features, Roblox Connect will let you call other players and display your facial expressions through your avatars, and all that's needed is your device's camera.
Roblox will also be coming to Meta Quest. The open beta has already been released, and in the first five days, it was downloaded over a million times. It comes just in time for the Quest 3 which is scheduled to launch later this year.

ArsTechnica reported on a recent consent judgment between Bungie and teenage cheater Luca Leone, wherein both parties agreed to the aforementioned court ruling. Bungie claimed that Leone's leveraging of cheat software constitutes Destiny 2 copyright infringement via graphical overlays and injected code, and the court has provided an assessment that this does, indeed, make for "unauthorized derivative work."
Following the court ruling, Leone is now officially and legally prohibited from "obtaining, downloading, copying, playing, streaming, or otherwise interacting with Bungie's games" ever again. Leone has also been ordered…]]></summary>

It's the weekend and that can mean only one thing — yes, it's time for another edition of Box Art Brawl!
Before we dive into this week's contestants, let's take a look at how things played out last time. Celebrating the release of Sabotage's excellent RPG Sea of Stars, we took a look at the cover variants from around the world, with you picking the winner. This one was a little closer than we would have expected (then again, both covers are really rather stunning), but it was the lesser-known Japanese box art that secured the win with 53% of the vote compared to Europe and North America's 47%.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[AMD's Radeon RX 6800 and 6800 XT graphics cards have proven surprisingly popular even into 2023, as new price drops (and relatively modest gen-on-gen performance increases for newer models) has left them as competitive options in terms of value for money. 
Today we've got a deal on the RX 6800 non-XT, with an MSI model going for just under $400 at Newegg. That's a $70 reduction from its usual price and $20 cheaper than the cheapest RX 6800 model on Amazon. That's an awesome deal for a strong 1440p graphics card that comes with a copy of Starfield Premium Edition (which includes the Shattered Space story expansion, a digital art book, the game's OST and a few weapon/suit skins on top of the base game).

It has been an entire year since Splatoon 3 was released (don't worry, we're just as shocked as you are) so, naturally, our minds are beginning to drift towards what comes next.
The correct answer is that mysterious 'Side Order' DLC — which is meant to show what would've happened if Team Order had beaten Team Chaos. But what about after that? The third entry in the splat-and-swim series was a huge success on launch and with the Inklings now popping up in Smash Bros. and Mario Kart, we think it's fair to say that the series is here for the long run.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Only Up!, the brutally difficult platformer that took Twitch by storm earlier this year, has been voluntarily removed from Steam by its creator.
Only Up! was created by SCKR Games, a studio consisting of just one person known as Indiesolodev. In a final update on Steam, they state that the game has been a source of stress over the past several months, and they now want to put the game behind them.
Indiesolodev will take the time off to grow as a developer, and they shared plans for a new game in the works called Kith.
“‘Kith’ - it will be a new experience and a new concept with realism, a completely different genre and setting, and the emphasis is on cinematography. This time I hope the project will be created by a small team. This is a challenging project on which I want to significantly improve my skills in game design.”

This is not the first time Only Up! was removed from Steam. It was taken down briefly back in late June amidst controversy regarding stolen assets. Indiesolodev quickly removed the problematic assets, and the updated game was back on Steam in a matter of days.
There has also been pushback to NFT artwork being featured on some assets in what many players saw as an advertisement for NFTs.
Despite the controversy and janky controls, Only Up! was quite popular on Twitch for a time, attracting the attention of let’s players and speedrunners. With the sudden increase in scrutiny, it’s no wonder the developer felt stressed. 
I’m glad Indiesolodev is taking some time for themselves. Hopefully, with the support of a team behind them, the development of Kith goes much more smoothly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I never watched the original Gargoyles animated series, but I've been on the internet for long enough to know that it's a cult favourite for being a Disney show with surprisingly dark themes. I also know that its video game adaptation, released in 1995 for the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive, was a 16-bit platformer with a similar appeal to other Disney games of the period like Aladdin and The Lion King.

Both those games were re-released in 2021, and now it's Gargoyles' turn. There's a first trailer for Gargoyles Remastered below.

Haver makes, among other things, comedic rotoscoped animations riffing on science fiction and video game tropes. 

It makes sense that Bethesda would have tapped him up to take the mick out of Starfield, then, given it combines both those tropes into a mockable whole.

Super Mario Bros. Wonder will continue the trend of simultaneous multiplayer platforming in the world of Super Mario and this time it's rolling with quite possibly the biggest roster ever, made up of not only Mario and co, but also a number of extras.
Nintendo recently asked fans on social media what character they would be picking first in this new Switch exclusive when it arrives next month, so we thought we would ask a similar question to our community here on Nintendo Life, and add a poll while we're at it to see who might even end up being the most popular character.

Kicking things off with the Nintendo big boys, we learnt from Eiji Aonuma that there are no plans for Tears of the Kingdom DLC (though that didn't stop us from discussing what we'd like to have seen), and we finally got to see the promised Miyamoto and Charles Martinet's video message — though it was hardly stuffed with new information...

Bethesda’s open-world games seem to swing between spectacular introductions or less inspired ones. Morrowind had you fill out paperwork before kicking you out into the world so you could watch a hapless mage plummet from the sky. Daggerfall drops you into a very beginner-unfriendly dungeon. Fallout 4 leaves you to witness the end of the world. Then there's Starfield.
Starfield asks you to look at some rocks. Then it kicks you into one of the greyest vistas we’ve seen since the late aughts, just to prep you for more tutorials.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[By the time I spent about an hour with Final Fantasy 7: Ever Crisis, I was hit with an overwhelming wave of familiarity. Not because of nostalgia for Final Fantasy 7, though I have fond memories of that game. Rather, it was because I have seen virtually this exact same game on mobile devices for the past seven years now.
Despite what Square Enix’s frankly confusing marketing might leave you to believe, Final Fantasy 7: Ever Crisis is just a gacha game. Calling it “another possibility for a remake” maybe isn’t untrue, but it's a bit misleading. Games like Genshin Impact or even Square Enix’s own Octopath Traveler: Champions of the Continent have really raised the bar for mobile games, so I don’t blame anyone for thinking Ever Crisis would be more than it is. But rather than reaching for tho…]]></summary>

There aren’t enough games where you play as people with butts that are also horses. I’d have to think very hard to name a single one, which is why it’s unfortunate that it’s taken me so long to find Golden Axe: The Revenge of Death Adder.
I’m familiar with the Golden Axe series, but I mostly know them from the games on Sega Genesis. My cousin and I used to play the original quite a bit, though we preferred Streets of Rage. I later discovered that the Japan-only Golden Axe III let you play as a ripped, shirtless panther-man. So, that’s pretty great.
Golden Axe: The Revenge of Death Adder is a bit unique, however, in that it was arcade-exclusive. It has, to my knowledge, never b…]]></summary>

More specifically, they're asking who we want to see. The new FFXIV survey inquires about all the important personal details, like favorite mounts and minions, how you describe the game, and so on. Then there's a question at the end about which characters you'd like to see receive short stories. And y'all, I love those short stories.
On my end, Square's survey prompted a flurry of frantic Discord and Slack messages urging everyone within direct messaging distance to go answer. Some of those con…]]></summary>

At the same time, it’s a new chapter in a long legacy that surrounds the interplay between the original tabletop RPG and the video gaming hobby. It’s a strange truth that, even as a video game, Baldur’s Gate 3 has emerged as one of the most potent arguments in years for trying out the actual D&D game at a table.
When I was a kid growing up in the ‘80s, playing D&D was not something you would readily admit to. Beyond the open ridicule you might face from your peers, it had a genuine chance to get you barred from some of your friends’ homes. No joke. More than a few parents back then truly believed that D&D was tantamount to actual demon worship, and they wouldn’t want t…]]></summary>

In Factorio: Space Age, every Item, Entity, and Equipment will now have five possible qualities. The qualities use familiar names: Normal, Uncommon, Rare, Epic, and Legendary. Each successive quality after Normal increases the bonus you get from the higher tier quality. Uncommon will grant a 30% bonus, Rare a 60% bonus, Epic a 90% bonus, and Legendary a 150% bonus.
The intended goal of adding Quality to Factorio is to balance Horizontal versus Vertical growth in the core gameplay. In the current version, players have the challenge of building more mining outposts and production facilities—which is the Horizontal growth. But, also, have to consid…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Everything comes full circle as Jean-Claude Van Damme prepares to join the lineup of Mortal Kombat 1. The inspiration for Johnny Cage is now a skin for the character, and he's on display in a new trailer. Van Damme provided his likeness and voice for the skin, which lets him fire off quips with the klassic kast. 
After trading blows that make Bloodsport seem tame, Van Damme closes out the clip with a brutal finisher. It's only appropriate that said finisher is delivered to Johnny Cage. Quite the gruesome price to pay for a life in the copycat spotlight. The video is age-restricted on YouTube, so you'll need to click through to watch. 
[caption id="attachment_403105" align="alignnone" width="640"] Screenshot via NetherRealm Studios[/caption]
Splits Decision
The very existence of the Mortal Kombat series can be traced back to JCVD. Co-creator Ed Boon wanted a fighter with Van Damme at the center of it, but the action film star declined. Thus, the notoriously gory, original fighter that still has us all double-checking our spelling of combat was born.
The Jean-Claude Van Damme character skin for Johnny Cage will be available as part of the Kombat Pack. As previously detailed, you can get that pack in the Premium Edition and Kollector's Edition versions. Van Damme will be released alongside six new early access DLC characters, including Quan Chi, Ermac, Takeda Takahashi, Peacemaker, Omni-Man, and Homelander. There will also be five new Kameo Fighters, all of which will be available post-launch. The Van Damme skin will be usable at launch, so start practicing your splits now.
Mortal Kombat 1 hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC via Steam and the Epic Games Store on September 14, 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It has been nearly a year since Splatoon 3 launched to much applause and fanfare. To celebrate, Nintendo is preparing to launch a truly contentious Splatfest — who among the members of Deep Cut would be the best leader? 
Starting at 5:00 p.m. PST / 8:00 p.m. EST on September 8 and extending through 5:00 p.m. PST / 8:00 p.m. EST on September 10, players must decide who would be the best leader: Shiver, Frye, or Big Man? It would seem as if the sides are evenly matched, at least based on the Twitter replies. “Who else is joining Team Big Man?” asked YouTuber Zack Scott, who received nearly 40 responses at the time of writing, all of which appealed for a different member of Deep Cut to take home the win. 
But, it would appear some folks fear the possibility of the majority ignoring the prompt in favor of making this Splatfest more of a popularity contest. “Remember guys, the question isn't about who your favorite Deep Cut member is, it's about who would make for a better leader out of them,” said one user on Twitter. They go on to admit their preference for Big Man, while also admitting their opinion that none of them would make good leaders. And then you’ve got the users who make it no secret that they’re not a fan of any available option. “Worst possible theme they could've done,” said one user. 
In any case, who are you rooting for in this anniversary Splatfest? Don’t forget to vote in-game at the Pledge Box!

The Xbox 360 Mega Building Kit is 1342 pieces that assemble into a 3:4 scale model of the launch model of Microsoft’s 2005 console. I was there when the Xbox 360 launched. It was a pretty exciting time when it came about. Then, the hardware issues started happening. This was commonly known as the “Red Ring of Death,” named because of the error code that was displayed on the light ring around the power button.
The issue was caused by components heating up then cooling off quickly, which would cause connectors within them to break. It apparently wasn’t caused specifically by the console reaching a high heat, but rather the rapid cooling afterward. Uh, wait. What were we talking about? Blocks?
The Xbox 360 Mega Building Kit has you construct the console itself, a controller, and a disc case for Halo 3. It even comes with a detachable hard drive. Isn’t that cute?
It’s interesting that this isn’t being done by Lego. No disrespect to Mega Bloks, but it’s hard to beat the prestige of the Lego brand. Nintendo had their NES immortalized, and Atari brought around a 2600 set.
The Microsoft Xbox 360 Collector MEGA Building Set is available for pre-order (if it isn’t sold out) for $149.99 USD. It ships out starting October 8, 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sonic Superstars is one of many big titles scheduled to release in October. In the lead-up to the game, we've slowly been learning more about what Sonic Team is preparing. There's a new rival called Trip who's going to have an interesting backstory. Although Sonic Superstars is ditching the pixel art style of Sonic Mania, it'll retain the gameplay of classic Sonic titles.

With only weeks away from the game's release, Sega has revealed the music for the Pinball Carnival Zone. The track, which is composed by Rintaro Soma, is a smooth yet energetic tune featuring plenty of retro polyphonic beeps and a beat that's sure to get you pumped to go fast. This isn't the only music we've heard from Sonic Superstars, as we also got a snippet of the Bridge Island Zone's music in a gameplay stream from Sega.

The importance of music in Sonic
It's no mistake that a song reveal is being used to hype fans, as music has been an important part of the franchise's identity since its beginning. To celebrate Sonic's musical history, Sega has a Sonic Symphony World Tour kicking off this month that features an orchestra recreating some of the beloved soundtracks from throughout the decades.
https://twitter.com/TeeLopes/status/1678963998866194435
The soundtrack is in good hands, as the main composer is Jun Senoue. Franchise fans will be familiar with this name, as he has worked on the music of a few series titles including Sonic the Hedgehog 3 and Sonic Heroes. He'll be assisted by Sonic Mania composer Tee Lopes, who has excitedly assured fans that Superstars will feature an even better soundtrack.
Sonic Superstars is scheduled to release on October 17 on Nintendo Switch, PC, PlayStation, and Xbox.

He announced this today on Twitter, stating that after working in the games industry for nearly 25 years, he is retiring to spend time with his wife and family. 
Most notably, Mustard served as the head of Fortnite, responsible for leading its storytelling and creative decision-making behind the game as a battle royale. Epic Games has not announced who will be taking over the role after Mustard retires, nor has it specified what the future of Fortnite looks like, although hundreds are working on it, and things will likely continue as usual. 
Here’s what Mustard posted on Twitter:
After an incredible adventure, I will be retiring from my role as Chief Creative Officer at Epic this month.

Xbox has struggled to get a massive hit for the Xbox Series X and S platforms. Halo Infinite ran into issues as players found the progression system lacking. Meanwhile, titles like Redfall failed to hit fan and critic expectations. Starfield garnering over six million players is likely some much-needed positive news for the Xbox team.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stray proved to be an unlikely phenomenon when it was released last July, and now the little kitty and its robotic pals are heading to the big screen. Publisher Annapurna has announced plans to develop an animated movie based on the hit indie game.
Per Entertainment Weekly, Annapurna Animation, the company's new animated film division, is following up its debut feature, Nimona, with a film adaptation of the 2022 adventure game. It will be the first game in Annapurna Interactive’s roster of titles to get the cinematic treatment, and, according to the publisher, it won’t be the last. Annapurna has not revealed a director, cast, or release window for the Stray film. Annapurna Animation is led by former Disney Animation executives Robert Baird and Andrew Millstein. 
"This is a game that's all about what makes us human, and there are no humans in it," Baird tells EW. "It's a buddy comedy about a cat and a robot, and there's such a hilarious dynamic. So, there's comedy inherent in this, but there's not one human being in this movie. I think it's one of the reasons why the game was incredibly popular, that you are seeing the world through the point of view of an adorable cat. How did they pull that off, and how are we going to pull that off in the movie? We will, even though sometimes it feels impossible, but we know that's the essence of the game and the key to telling the story."
Stray was developed by French studio BlueTwelve. Taking place in a post-apocalyptic Earth devoid of humans, players control a cat who gets separated from its friends and sets out to find them. The cat's journey takes it through cities occupied by sentient robots, which it befriends along the way, namely a flying drone named B-12. Stray was among the most celebrated games of last year, winning Best Debut Indie at the Game Awards, and made its way to Xbox last month. You can read our review of Stray here.

The most likely game to appear is Final Fantasy XIV, which is heading to Xbox next spring ahead of its upcoming Dawntrail expansion.

Of course, there are plenty of big Japanse developed titles incoming that could get a spotlight, and it's always interesting to see what Asian companies and titles it courts each year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Toys with dreams of wrestling greatness.
If you’ve ever had the oddly specific dream of rising through the ranks of a toy-based wrestling world, then you’re in luck. WrestleQuest enters the ring with a deadly combo of late-'80s wrestling nostalgia and mid-'90s JRPG mechanics, celebrating both while not quite managing to deliver the three-count at the end. However, if you grew up in those very specific eras, you should find enough here to power through to the championship fight.
Mega Cat Studio’s latest offering builds a fascinating world right from the start. The populace of a children’s toy box has become obsessed with professional wrestling, idolising the likes of Macho Man Randy Savage and Jake the Snake. Life in the toy box revolves around wrestling and every conflict is settled in the ring with flashy moves and high-stakes action.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There’s a growing subgenre of horror games that lure you in with cutesy charm before revealing something sinister waiting beneath it. Your Doki Doki Literature Clubs. Your Among The Sleeps. Your Opening A Box Of Celebrations Only To Find Your Mum’s Knitting Kit. Absolutely bone-chilling stuff. The Bunny Graveyard fits right in with this idea, which tells a seemingly sweet tale across a series of mini-games à la WarioWare, but as expected, things take a creepy turn in the trailer below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I first clocked the mysterious-looking OU when Japanese indie collective Asobu did their pre-Bitsummit showcase stream in 2021. It wasn't entirely clear what OU was going to be at that point, other than a sort-of-puzzle game about an amnesiac boy who'd found himself in a fantastical world of picturebook pages, and even when Alicia Haddick played it for herself at Bitsummit proper the following year, OU still had a strong, impenetrable sense of ambiguity about it.  
But its striking art and rustic guitar soundtrack have stuck in my mind ever since, and finally, OU is now out in the wild. I've only played about two hours of it so far, but it's clear there's still a lot more to discover within its dreamy little vignettes. It's one of those games that's designed to be played multiple times to get the full extent of the story, and I've just hit the first of those Nier Automata-esque restarts. Honestly, I'm not quite sure what to think of it yet, but one thing is certain: I can't get it out of my head.

There are serene floating islands, wide open flying and a varied chocolate box of puzzles. Publisher Behaviour Interactive (from Dead By Daylight fame) have now announced a free open playtest, available to everyone from now until September 21st. As lovely as the game looks, I’m excited to try Islands Of Insight for myself.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Although most of my favourite films are tragedies, games with a grim and heavy premise don't often appeal to me as much as you'd think. I wasn't quite expecting to enjoy The Man Came Around, then, as it's about a group of desperate people trying to cross the border to escape their authoritarian government. In Winter, no less.
It's actually rather light in practice, although not in a flippant or trivialising way. The message is clearly that these things are serious and our sympathies should be, well, basic concern for the wellbeing of other people. But it's not as miserable to play as games with such serious themes often are. The premise is serious, but the act of playing it is not. I'd call it "diverting" rather than "entertaining", but the bottom line is there's a good afternoon or two in there for you.

There’s also been a shocking lack of, uhm, male organ-shaped spacecraft which makes putting this post together much less hard. But for now, onward! Let’s admire some cool ships.

I spent most of my hour-long demo session steadily working my way through its extensive tutorial, as I have not, in fact, played Cities: Skylines before now - although I can at least confirm that its tutorial is very newbie-friendly, and that I now feel more prepared to give it a go properly when it comes out in full on October 24th.
But the thing that really impressed me was just the sheer scope of its playable spaces. We've known since the end of July that its maps are roughly 5x bigger than those in the first game, and when I saw Colossal Order's Maps & Themes video, I thought, 'Yes, those sure look enormous!' But actually seeing them in person really put things into perspective for me, especially when I tried zooming the camera out and it just kept going and going and going and…

And while that reveal teased what many thought to be Kraven the Hunter, it wasn’t confirmed to be him until later.

Even among its astronomical system requirements, an inflexible demand for solid state storage seemed like a stretch; after all, Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart runs mostly fine on a hard drive, and in a previous life that game was employed as a cheerleader for the PS5’s SSD.

Since Lars Sundström, aka lman, joined our team as the iOS porter, we have made significant progress. Thus, you no longer need to compile ScummVM yourself in order to add it to your iOS or iPadOS device. 
If you want to help by testing this version, just follow this Testflight link and enroll yourself in the test program. This may require installing Apple’s Testflight app. You can find instructions on how to install games and how to play them on our documentation portal.
We truly appreciate your feedback. You can share your thoughts with the Testflight feedback feature, where you can attach screenshots and post detailed descriptions. Alternatively, you can use our bugtracker, e-mail us at ios@scummvm.org, or post on our Discord Server. Your help will let us eventually add ScummVM to the App Store.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some would say the best way to wind down after a rough day down the Content Reactors isn’t to play a grotty occult horror game, but I caught a trailer for Tenebris Somnia earlier, and couldn’t help myself. In this foetid offering from Argentinian devs Andrés Borghi and Tobías Rusjan of Saibot Studios, you play a young woman, Julia, who is visiting her film-maker ex-boyfriend to drop off their old apartment key. Julia’s having a hard time getting over the break-up, but she’s clearly doing better than her ex: his apartment is full of broken glass, anomalous red gloop and creepy occult books. 


The game’s twist is that it’s two visual styles thrust into the same frame. On the one hand, you'll explore an 8-bit world of unpleasantly bright colours, finding and combining objects adventure-game-style. I say adventure-game-style, because this is a bit more energetic than most adventure games – you can equip and swing a wrench, and there’s a run button. On the other hand, well. Click the headline to find out, if you dare. Yes, this is me trying to do a jumpscare. Brace yourself! (It's just occurred to me, 24 hours too late, that the above joke only makes sense if you're viewing our Latest feed. Everybody else, erm - scroll down?)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mortal Kombat co-creator Ed Boon made an unexpected appearance on the popular interview show Hot Ones to talk about Mortal Kombat 1 and the series as a whole. As Boon sweats through increasingly spicy wings, we also get a glimpse at the previously announced Jean-Claude Van Damme skin for Johnny Cage. 
For the unfamiliar, Hot Ones is a 1-on-1 interview show in which celebrity guests are asked questions while devouring wings that get gradually spicier as the interview progresses (usually to humorous results). Boon’s discussion delves into his entry into the game industry, Netherrealm's decision-making process when selecting cross-over fighters, the studio's approach to storytelling, and other topics. Boon is one of, if not the first, video game developer to appear on the show, and watching him share his fighting game knowledge while simultaneously fighting for his life is an entertaining treat. 


During the discussion, we get the first clip of Johnny Cage's Jean-Claude Van Damme character skin, which you can see in the photos below. It will be purchasable in the Kombat pack that will be included in the Premium/Kollector's editions of the game. 

Mortal Kombat 1 launches on September 19 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC. For the latest roster reveals, check out trailers for Nitara, Sindel/General Shao, Ashrah/Havik, and Smoke/Rain.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the most succinct yet exciting announcements from last year’s D23 Expo was Gargoyles Remastered, a modernized facelift of the classic (and challenging) side-scrolling Sega Genesis title based on the popular ‘90s cartoon. A new trailer revealed the game’s new presentation and an October release date.
Gargoyles Remastered takes the 1995 game and repaints it with a coat of new enhanced visuals more faithful to the series (and you can instantly toggle between the new look and the classic 16-bit graphics). It also includes the usual bells and whistles for remastered Disney games, such as an instant rewind, wide-screen presentation, and achievements. The original soundtrack has also been remastered. Check out the game's first trailer below. 


If you’re a Gargoyles fan looking to fight evil as Goliath and his friends again, you can pick up Gargoyles Remastered on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on October 19.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[E3 2023 was canceled back in March, and PAX organizer ReedPop was in charge of organizing the event, the first of a multi-year contract. However, E3's overseer the ESA has announced this partnership will not continue.
According to GameIndustry.biz, the ESA and ReedPop have come to a mutual decision to part ways. On top of that, E3 2024, which is still planned to take place, will not be held at its traditional venue, the Los Angeles Convention Center. This had been previously reported by the city itself. There’s no word on where E3 will be held, but the site reports that the ESA is also looking to completely reinvent the show in 2025. 
“We appreciate ReedPop’s partnership over the past 14 months and support their ongoing efforts to bring industry and fans together through their various events,” said ESA president and CEO Stanley Pierre-Louis in a statement to GameIndustry.biz. “While the reach of E3 remains unmatched in our industry, we are continuing to explore how we can evolve it to best serve the video game industry and are evaluating every aspect of the event, from format to location. We are committed to our role as a convenor for the industry and look forward to sharing news about E3 in the coming months.”
ReedPop had been tasked with revamping this year’s ill-fated E3 after the show had collapsed over the last few years due to the pandemic and waning interest from publishers/developers. The 2023 edition fell through after Nintendo, Sony, and Microsoft declined to attend alongside publishers such as Ubisoft and Sega. The last in-person E3 was in 2019, and outside of the online-only 2021 event, every subsequent E3 has been completely canceled. Geoff Keighley's Summer Game Fest has filled the void since then.

Just one more Steam link and I’ll be fine, promise.
And I don’t mean short games in the seven- or eight-hour sense. Not even film-length games like Portal or Jazzpunk. No, I seek to gorge on the slightest sub-hour canapés, games in which you can see and do everything in one or hour or less. "Irresponsibly large"? Another time, Mister Starfield, I crave something irrevocably small.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We’re more than six years into the Switch's lifecycle. While the console has proven capable of providing great games still to this year – looking at you, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom – you’d be hardpressed to find a player who isn’t ready for Nintendo’s next console. While rumors continue to swirl about what the Switch successor could be and when it might be released, new reports from Eurogamer and Video Games Chronicle say the company showed it to developers behind closed doors at Gamescom last month. 
Eurogamer says its sources say Nintendo showed partners tech demos designed to demonstrate how well the Switch successor runs. Specifically, one of the demos shown was reportedly a “souped-up version” of the Switch launch title, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. Eurogame…]]></summary>

As billionaire jebends plot to establish their own corporate fiefdoms amongst the stars, our descendents' potential spacelives are looking as miserable as collecting 5 spacewolf livers. But I find some hope in spaceship salvage sim Hardspace: Shipbreaker, both in the overt plot about unionisation and in the small satisfaction of doing a job well. Head down, shut up, and focus on dismantling this spaceship carefully and efficiently. It's an attitude that won't save the world but can get you through one more day, and sometimes that's enough.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I finished Part 1 of my perverse effort to play Starfield entirely as a space sim, I was both terrified and tantalised. A quick reminder of the rules: I can only acquire new ships by commandeering them, with no planetary landings permitted, which also means that I can't just shuffle between ships at whim after adding them to my hangar. It's possible the game contains an orbital shipyard of some kind - if you've found one, don't spoil! - but at the time of writing, any vessel I abandon is essentially gone for good. 


My first trophy as greenhorn orbital bandit Mary Read was a UC Transpo, which isn't so much a spaceship as a shoebox with toilet roll tubes and detergent bottles glued to the outside, its ordnance limited to a single laser. I began my second leg confidently expecting to spend many hours in this Fisher Price starmobile, vainly searching for a wounded battlecruiser or an abandoned solar yacht or some other, more capable vessel accessible to a space pirate of extremely modest means. This is going to be Jalopy: Galactic Edition, I said to myself. Imagine my shock (and slight disappointment) when I jumped to the very next planet and proceeded to comprehensively ding over a Crimson Fleet Spectre.

I sound like I hate it, but don't. James actually likes it. Nate has not played it but he asks us about it.
As you might imagine, the field of stars also makes up the bulk of our What We've Been Playing this week, although Nate is considering whether to start that or Baldur's Gate 3 - we give conflicting answers... Plus, some interesting recommendations, and Garfield.

In truth, I was surprised (and somewhat saddened) by some of the comments we received around our Baldur's Gate 3 coverage. If you missed them, they were mostly in the vein of saying our increased volume of BG3-related posts felt like "spam", harking back to when we (and the internet at large) all went similarly bananas over Elden Ring last year. I know it can sometimes seem like writing about these games - particularly on RPS - feels like we're somehow neglecting everything else going on in PC gaming. But the truth is a little more complicated than that, so I wanted to take some time to talk a bit about this in this month's Letter From The Editor, because there are a number of reasons why this happens - and will probably continue to happen more generally as websites fight for survival.

In the case of Affogato, it’s three of my favourite types of games mashed together: it’s Coffee Talk by way of Persona by way of any card-based tower defence game – only here it’s sort of "reverse tower defence", as the game's Steam page is keen to point out. It's your own card units that are the ones moving along pre-defined tracks wreaking havoc on stationary enemies, not the other way around. Maybe tower assault would be a better term, but that's by the by. Served with a dollop of anime froth on the top, Affogato should be my exact cuppa joe. But despite its intriguing ingredients, I wouldn't say it's been wholly successful in slooshing them all together.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Oft' am I struck by the fact that video game homes belonging to characters in the depths of despair are nicer that all of the homes I've lived in myself. Granted, I'm a thirty-something in a country with a years-long housing crisis, so even the Baker House in Resident Evil 7 is of "I think I could just about afford that one day" status. But it comes to something when a 70s depresso-capsule at the bottom of the sea has more square footage and storage space than I do.
Under The Waves (which got patched today, and not before time because I've had one fatal error crash per play session since it came out last week so far) is about a deep sea diver called Stan, who is living and working at the bottom of a big wet metaphor for grief. You will know this because a) its Steam page says this up front, and b) it's not super subtle (this game is published by Quantic Dream). But, as newsman Edwin pointed out to me today, when was the last time the sea wasn't a metaphor for grief? It's never a metaphor for enjoying a nice raspberry ripple ice cream. And despite Stan making reference to "what [he's] been through" half an hour in, I think it does a great job with its chthonic sadness. You float about in your tiny little sub in a great misty darkness, listen to the extremely melancholy music, and you start thinking about sad stuff in your own life. But you get into Stan's capsule living area and you think "this guy has a carpet and a book nook, what the hell?"

The videogame in question is Pyrolith's V.A. Proxy, which I've had my eye on for a while, on account of it being inspired by Nier: Automata and Devil May Cry, with a landscape of megastructures and bruised and rusty art direction that calls to mind The Signal from Tölva. In this moody open world action game, you play one of three robots who awaken to find their memories gone, and promptly set out in search of their creator. It'd be an eye-catcher even without the atomic parry, which you can witness for yourself in the embedded clip below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Are Starfield's planets continuous spaces? Are they just collections of sealed-off maps that fake the presence of landmarks such as named cities beyond their invisible boundaries? I just don't even know any more, but Starfield mod creators are looking into it. One intrepid soul, Draspian, has tinkered with the code to disable said invisible boundaries, and in the process, revealed that planetary maps do, in fact, join together, though as you might be expecting, Starfield doesn't take kindly to being treated this way.

        <updated>2023-09-06T22:49:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mortal Kombat 1’s roster already has a few returning names from the series’ 3D era in the forms of Ashrah and Havik, and another long-lost favorite joins the fight. Nitara is making her long-awaited return, and it’s such a big homecoming that NetherRealm has enlisted actress Megan Fox to voice her.
Nitara is a vampire that made her debut in 2002’s Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance. She’s only been playable in a couple of entries, had a small cameo in Mortal Kombat 11, and appeared in the 2021 Mortal Kombat film. Despite having only a few appearances to her name, she’s endured as favorite among fans who grew up with the 2000s era, and she looks as deadly as ever in MK 1. 
Megan Fox brings Nitara to life, and you can get a sample of her performance in the trailer below. “I grew up playing Mortal Kombat and I can’t believe that I’m voicing a character in the new game," Fox says in a press release. "It’s an honor to be a part of one of the greatest video game legacies of all time.” Given that Ronda Rousey voiced Sonya Blade in MK 11, it’s not surprising to see NetherRealm rope in another celebrity to perform one of its kombatants. 


Mortal Kombat 1 launches on September 19 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC. Check out our latest hands-on impressions of its Invasions and Story Mode here. Be sure to also watch the game's most recent trailer from Gamescom 2023.]]></summary>

But the latter was the highlight of my experience. 
I completed three contracts during my hands-on time, each at different levels of progression for protagonist Basim Ibn Is’haq. Contracts are essentially mini-missions that task you with eliminating a target, obtaining an item, or doing something like moving a boat to a specified location.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Space. The medium frontier. These are the voyages of me, reviewing Bethesda's big space RPG Starfield. It's the company's first new IP in almost 30 years (a claim that contains in it an inherent threat for Starfield 2), and though Bethesda has copied some of their own homework for some themes and factions, Starfield is indeed a spacefaring adventure of epic scale and sometimes surprising beauty. It's this scale that makes Starfield feel unfortunately small and empty, a place that still has those fun little Bethesda side quests that escalate into something huge and absurd, but that can also swallow them whole in its cold, star-scattered grandeur.

A na scheduleru systému je, aby úlohy rozhazoval jádrům pokud možno optimálně, tedy například i v situacích, kdy je sice nejlepší jádro CPU volné, ale úloha běží na jiném CCX modulu v jiném segmentu L3 cache a její přesun tam a zpět by byl horší než nechat úlohu doběhnout na jiném, ale bližším CPU jádru, případně existuje vhodnější CPU jádro z hlediska parametrů frekvence a napětí pro danou frekvenci.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the grim darkness of the far future, the galaxy is your oyster. Or at least it will be, once you've played 100 hours of Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader, an RPG from Pathfinder developer Owlcat in which you can buy planets, configure your genocidal Dark Eldar friend to strike ten times a turn, and gaze on ruefully as a demon explodes out of your Psyker's head. 


An immediate and shameful disclaimer: I can't match Nic Reuben's deep knowledge of the 40K tabletop universe, which saw him ruminating upon the mysteries of the Koronus Expanse back in 2022, while holding Owlcat's feet to the fire over the absence of space dwarves. The nearest I got to playing 40K as a lad was its Battlefleet Gothic spin-off (which none of my friends were interested in, so when I say "playing", I mean that I sat in a room staring glumly at some unpainted Lunar-class Cruisers while other kids went out and climbed trees). The framing I'm working with instead, based on an hour of hands-off Rogue Trader gameplay, is that it's sort of Warhammer Mass Effect, but with XCOM-style turn- and grid-based combat, and while there are opportunities to be a compassionate hero, you fundamentally only have the option of playing Renegade. Let's dig in!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The animated film Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem has garnered critical acclaim since its release in theaters last month. As fans know, the best way to follow up a good TMNT project is to make a video game out of it, and that’s exactly what's happening next year. 
Publisher Outright Games, along with Paramount and Nickelodeon, have announced a new untitled TMNT game in development set within the Mutant Mayhem universe. It will feature the same striking visual design and follows a new story set months after the movie's events. There’s no word yet on if the film’s ensemble cast will reprise their roles.
In terms of gameplay, a press release only hints that the project involves “combining energetic ninja teamwork gameplay with a humorous narrative, players will take control of the Turtles as they interact with a host of memorable characters from the franchise and fight to save this stylized take on New York City from a new mutant threat.” Outright Games has experience working on games based on kid-friendly licenses, making titles based on Star Trek: Prodigy, How to Train Your Dragon, Paw Patrol, and Peppa Pig. 
The TMNT: Mutant Mayhem game is targeting PC and consoles. It’s the latest project in what’s been quite a renaissance for the Turtles, especially in video games. The resurgence kicked off with last year’s well-received TMNT: Shredder’s Revenge, which recently got a big new expansion. The Cowabunga Collection bundled nearly every classic TMNT game into one package for a modern audience. A single-player action game based on the beloved TMNT: The Last Ronin graphic novel is also in the works.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Publisher Tilting Point has revealed Cypher 007, a new top-down action game starring James Bond, coming to Apple Arcade on iOS devices later this month. It launches on September 29 and takes players into "The Mind Trap." 
Because it's an Apple Arcade game, it will require a subscription. But after subscribing, the game is technically free-to-play and will feature zero microtransactions, like all Apple Arcade games. In it, you'll be able to unlock new gadgets and weapons, build resources, collect outfits and new character models from across the franchise, and more. 
Check out the Cypher 007 teaser trailer for yourself below: 


"The criminal mastermind Blofeld and head of Spectre has once again hatched a plan to sabotage his archenemy James Bond," the game's description reads. "This time, he has utilized brainwashing techniques known as 'The Mind Trap,' holding Bond captive in a mental prison in an attempt to turn him into the ultimate double agent. Play as Agent 007 on his most challenging missions yet – escape the Mind Trap, defeat Blofeld, and put an end to the Cypher program." 
Because it's a 007 game, you'll run into other MI6 operatives like Q, M, and Moneypenny, all while completing levels that increase in difficulty as you progress. You can compete against other players, too. 

Cypher 007 hits Apple Arcade later this month on September 29.]]></summary>

My sense of time's crushing burden is not alleviated for learning that Epic are staffing up for work on "a new experience in the Fortnite ecosystem", which sounds a lot like a Fortnite open worlder.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lightyear Frontier is not the kind of game that fits neatly into a 30-minute Gamescom demo. There's so much to see and do in this laidback farming mech sim that by the time my demo ends, I barely feel like I've scratched the surface of it (and that's even with the assistance of some handy secret dev cheats to show me some of the structures and features they've got planned later on in the game). Rather, this is a game that's designed to unfurl slowly, bit by bit, over the course of several hours, and before we begin, developer Frame Break's CEO Joakim Hedström tells me they've shortened the game's opening sequence for this particular demo, just so they can get players right into the thick of things as quickly as possible. 
But even on this whistlestop tour, there's plenty to dig into and delight in here - not least its gloriously bright and inviting colour palette (take that, Todd). I got to sample its farming, its wonderfully weighty mech exploration, and even indulge in a little bit of, well, powerwashing. Yep, PowerWash Simulator's influence was well and truly felt at this year's Gamescom, and I'm so very here for it.

And if you were planning to get it through PC Game Pass, that's another issue, as Game Pass games are locked down behind the fully Deck-incompatible Universal Windows Platform system. If the wonder of space depends on the it being a borderless infinity realm of endless possibilities, nobody told Microsoft.
There is a way, however, to sidestep both problems. Xbox Cloud Gaming will let you play Starfield on the Steam Deck at a steady (enough) 30fps, by streaming the game from Microsoft's cloud network direct to your screen - no Proton GE or Lutris launcher required. It still takes some setting up, but luckily, you’ve already clicked onto a step-by-step guide on how to do it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Friend, are you weary of talk of blockbuster space-faring RPGs and blockbuster D&D adaptations and blockbusters in general? Do you yearn for the older, simpler days before the great Unrealification and the invention of sex scenes, when people called a spike pit a spike pit, and you could count all the different colours in a screenshot on your fingers? Do you, in fact, reject this framing of retro-styled 2D pixelart games as "older" and "simpler", regarding it as condescending and false? Look, shut up already. I'm trying to tell you about Isles of Sea and Sky from developers Jason Newman, Dan Collver and Craig Collver.

A large portion of '90s kids look back on Rugrats with great fondness. As one of the defining cartoons of both the decade and the network of Nickelodeon, Rugrats spawned its fair share of licensed video games, but last week's announcement of a new one still came as a shock. That game, Rugrats: Adventures in Gameland, doesn't just feature retro sensibilities – it's an actual all-new retro game built in 2023. Though the first Rugrats video game didn't release until the late '90s, Rugrats: Adventures in Gameland gives you the full retro experience, paying homage…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ring the bell, everybody, it's time for another round of game developers telling players that they don't really understand what a "game engine" is. The spark this time is little-known science fiction adventure Starfield, which I believe we've reported on before. The game has a few obvious foibles - in my experience as a space pirate, NPCs sometimes struggle to navigate their surroundings, and then there are those stark disconnects between planetary surfaces and orbital space. Hiccups such as these have led a few players to wonder whether the game might work better using different technology, and in particular, the newer versions of Epic's ubiquitous Unreal Engine. Isn't Bethesda's proprietary Creation Engine, which the company have been updating since 2011, getting a little long in the tooth?
You'll find a lot of the discussion below this post from Digital Foundry boffin John Linneman on Twxter, which has attracted both gloating PlayStation fans (remember, Starfield is Xbox-only in console land) and a number of thoughtful replies from some fairly senior game developers. This conversation goes back a fair way, of course - people have been ragging on Bethesda for using "the same engine" for years. And there's a definite air of world-weariness to some of the developer responses.

For context, that ties the best price we've seen for a 2TB NVMe SSD, although this option comes with a heatsink and is therefore a better choice for many PC and all PS5 owners.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The upcoming reimagining of Alone in the Dark is skipping Halloween this year. Instead of inviting players back to Derceto on October 25, the survival horror adventure will now arrive on January 16.
In a press release, developer Pieces Interactive offers a candid explanation for the move: it doesn’t want the game to compete with October’s heavy hitters like Marvel's Spider-Man 2 and another big horror game, Alan Wake 2. 
“Our intention is to avoid competing with the wake of Alan's epic release and to evade the dazzling skyline of cities adorned by the graceful swings of Spider-Man," Pieces writes. "We aim to truly remain as Alone in the Dark as possible. To honor this, the spine-chilling horror game has been rescheduled to unveil its horrors on January 16th, 2024. This extension will serve a dual purpose: not only will it permit us to meticulously perfect the gaming experience, but it will also grant us the opportunity to fully immerse ourselves in the remarkable releases of October.”
The studio also released a new trailer starring David Harbour’s Edward Carnby, one of the game’s protagonists, showing off his performance and impressive facial capture. 


Alone in the Dark is a modernized revamp of the 1992 survival horror classic that stars actors Jodie Comer and David Harbour as protagonists Emily Hartwood and detective Edward Carnby, respectively. Players control one character to explore the haunted Derceto hospital to solve a sinister mystery, with both scenarios offering different story threads and moments. You can read our full preview of the game here. It will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.]]></summary>

As for the Animal Crossing: New Horizons Switch Lite consoles, there’s Isabelle’s Aloha Edition, which is a pink Switch Lite with Animal Crossing leaves on the back of the console, and Tommy’s Aloha Edition, which is a teal Switch Lite with the same leaf details on the back of the handheld console.

From the Stray Demons of Dark Souls through Bloodborne's Cleric Beast to the dragons of Elden Ring, you must learn not to be awed by creatures who look they could kill you with a sneeze. You must learn to run towards that titanic knight with the enormous shield, rolling between its colossal ankles, using its stature against it. You must learn to see past the visual overkill of a swing that would surely fell a skyscraper, registering only the effects on your poise and health bar. It's a learning curve, for sure, and that makes the modding of mechs from Armored Core 6: Fires Of Rubicon into Elden Ring a little more than the usual act of mischievous fanservice.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You may have seen that Alice Bee has started a "land on every planet" run of Bethesda's Starfield. By total coincidence - I promise you it's accidental, I was so pleased - I've been working on a "land on no planets" run of Starfield. The reasoning for this is as follows: people say that outer space is the worst part of the game, because it's just an irritating interval between the maps where the majority of quests, loot, intrigues, etc are found. It's a fast travel loading screen you can fly about in. But what if you double-down on the space stuff? 


What if you never descend from orbit, not even to repair, modify or upgrade your ship and offload inventory? What if, rather than buying new ships or building them, you progress exclusively by boarding other captains and making off with ship and cargo? How well does Starfield scrub up as a thoroughbred space sim that leans towards bloodthirsty piracy? Here to answer these questions is Mary Read, my custom character and budding astral freebooter. She's named for her distant ancestor, the legendary 18th century English buccaneer Mary Read. She's had a crack at life on shore, setting foot most recently on Earth's Moon, but from this point on, her fate and fortune lies amid the stars. Arrr!

This is important because ScummVM currently supports only the Macintosh versions of these games. These versions were produced by Tetraedge and are built on a completely different engine than the original Windows versions; basically, they are reimplementations, not ports. Now, thanks to the folks from ZOOM-Platform, you can easily obtain these game variants.

In the 22 years since Shenmue’s debut, I’ve played the game 23 times. Twenty-three times I’ve lived the life of protagonist Ryo Hazuki, watched his father die, and navigated his world and experiences. Each time I’ve realized something new about the game, the people who made it, or something new about myself.
Playthrough 23 was the most poignant of them all. I saw, noticed, and felt things I hadn’t in any other, and it’s given me a new appreciation for Yu Suzuki and Sega’s AM2 development team.
More than anything else, Shenmue is a video game about how a real person in a real world inhabited by other real people experiences the death of a loved one and the loneliness that follows.

So it’s a different game, different protagonists, different gameplay." After getting the chance to learn more about the game and see it in action, this distinction makes a lot of sense. For me to call it a sequel was misleading, given how different the games look and play.

Retro love letters are a dime a dozen these days. From titles that veer too close to the source material to games that take the kernel of an earlier game's original concept and expand it into previously unforeseen realms, nostalgic experiences are everywhere in the games industry. Yacht Club Games emerged as an early leader of this trend with its smash hit Shovel Knight, which took the 2D action-platformer genre and gave it several fun twists despite keeping the core gameplay and visual styles faithful to the 8-bit graphics with which many of us grew up. Similarly, Yacht Club's next game, Mina the Hollower, looks like a …]]></summary>

Void Stranger is the work of Finnish indie System Erasure, whose vertically scrolling shmup/mystery game ZeroRanger was one of Dominic Tarason's (RPS in peace) best games of 2018. The new title is a sokoban-style puzzle game, which is to say, it's broadly about shoving crates around, but as the name suggests, Void Stranger has bigger ambitions than helping you while away five minutes over lunch. It's a game of faith, amnesia and devilry, which reportedly portions out its secrets across multiple playthroughs. Here's a trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[People have talked about Baldur's Gate 3 going a bit wonk in the final chapter when you reach the titular big city. It was actually my favourite act of the whole game - not that I doubt other people saw things going on the wonk a lot, but I did, thankfully, escape more or less unscathed (apart from one instance where, for some reason, Gale the smug sex wizard had a conversation with me, and then immediately repeated the exact same conversation). For me, the final act of BG3 is the act when all my nonsensing in the rest of the game paid off. The part where it turned out it did matter that I spent a painstaking hour separating and killing a bunch of guards in a mine, so I could save the gnomes trapped in a cave-in. It was also where a genie turned me into cheese.
Spoilers, obvs, if you're that way inclined.

While Sayer the Space Scoundrel is having trouble getting around as they engage with the main story, I have started another character to engage in some nonsense (to the extent that there is any in Starfield) - the first of such I've detailed here.
I've said it before, but you're my very best friend, so we're going to play Starfield together. Join me as we step, wobbly and uncertain like Bambi on ice, into Bethesda's huge and partially procedurally generated space RPG universe for the adventures of Turbo Eclipse (I used an astronaut name generator intended for a child's party), a spacefaring nerd who longs only for the thrill of science. Yes, we're going to visit every planet in Starfield. Or at least as many as possible before I lose every single one of my marbles. And hey, planets look kinda like marbles! Strap in, spacefarers. Let's put this proc gen through its paces.

That's right, this month's RPS Game Club pick is the alternate-reality detective adventure Hypnospace Outlaw!


Released in 2018 and developed by Tendershoot, Hypnospace Outlaw takes place in a warped version of 1999 where accessing the internet is done via a headband you wear while you sleep. You play as an enforcer - a moderator of sorts - tasked with keeping the users of Hypnospace in check by reporting any violations you discover on their personal web pages.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As someone with a general aversion to online competitive modes in games, I'm always grateful when someone, for once, especially in this age of endlessly bland multiplayer experiments, thinks of the solitary solo player. I'm especially grateful when us single player preferers get a knowing nod of acknowledgement in fighting games, too, which are so naturally geared toward pitting your skills against other human beings that anything involving playing against the AI is often either an afterthought or so threadbare that you can't help but feel like you're missing the point. 
But that's still, for my sins, how I like to consume fighting games when I occasionally play them - which isn't often, I'll admit, for exactly the reasons described above - and so when I sat down for my Mortal Kombat 1 demo session at Gamescom this year, I was pleased to see not just a very slick story mode in attendance, but also a new single player challenge mode called Invasions that publishers Warner Bros described as "a giant interactive board game" that "lent into action RPG" territory. Its numerous node-based missions looked substantial based on what I played, and the idea of applying a seasonal service model to it, endlessly rotating in new locations and missions every so often - a whole different Invasion, so to speak - is actually something I'd be very much behind. It, that is, I was a) good at Mortal Kombat, and b) the missions I played during my demo weren't quite so… err… boring.

And there is a remake on the way – of which we’ve only seen concept art. But by most measures, the franchise has been dormant for a decade.
Nonetheless, Fisher was once the lead of a game momentous enough to compete for sales with Halo, have Hideo Kojima’s Metal Gear Solid team taking notes, and find itself referenced as the graphical and technical benchmark of the early Xbox years.

The adventure game's strong premise of a writer magically entering books to steal treasures wore thin across uninteresting puzzles, repetitive crafting, bland combat, and—worst of all for a game about the wonder of words—iffy writing. But once the credits rolled, I realised I had been fooled by its polished looks, and its core development was team was tiny (with a squad of external contributors), leaving me feeling a lot more forgiving. So, it's a good game to check out on Game Pass, or at least flick through the opening chapters.

It’s the work of seasoned modder PureDark, previously seen hammering both DLSS and FSR into Skyrim. I’ve tried the Starfield mod and it works rather nicely, granting a visible quality boost on RTX graphics cards while equalling FSR’s ability to smooth out Starfield’s sometimes-tricky performance. Unfortunately (and largely by association), it’s also been dragged into a spot of nasty business, one involving a separate mod for DLSS 3 frame generation and PureDark’s application of DRM.

Especially when I get to the characters saying ‘I love you’ to each other…” Gaider mimes the sickliness of the scene and his own horrified response. “Apparently I did it so well on Baldur’s Gate II that James Ohlen kept handing me this stuff. And, god, I hated it so much.”
It’s weird, in fact, that Gaider wound up working on Baldur’s Gate II at all - let alone that he became synonymous with Dragon Age and romanceable companions afterwards. At 27 years old, he ran a hotel in Edmonton, Alberta - the same city where, unbeknownst to him, Bioware was busy making its name. Once it came time to make a sequel to Baldur’s Gate, Bioware cast around for local writers, and a friend recommended Gaider, who had played D&D in the ‘80s before it fell out of fashion.

"Ms Lae'zel, I happen to be a graduate of BioWare Sex University," I told her sternly, adjusting my robe. "If I'm going to have a torrid liaison in an RPG it'll be 60 hours from now, just before the final battle, and let's face it, I'm more likely to get scared of alienating party members and end up friendzoning everybody."
Lae'zel proved persuasive, however - "I like the way you stink," was how I think she phrased it - and one risque fade-to-black later, we were triumphantly entwined in post-coital bliss. Well, at the risk of empirically demonstrating that romance is dead, it turns out all that might have been down to a technical problem. According to Larian CEO Sven Vincke, Baldur's Gate 3 characters were accidentally encoded to have very low standards at launch. Haha, I certainly can't relate!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the bigger Discourse torpedoes aimed at Starfield's glittering hull over the past month has been its strict division between planetary surfaces and outer space. Space sim fanatics were dismayed to learn that you can't actually fly down to the surface of the planets you're orbiting - instead, you hit a button to initiate a loading break and a landing cutscene, which makes outer space feel more like a glorified airlock chamber than, well, outer space. This segmented approach has prompted many unflattering comparisons with No Man's Sky, in which you can manually pilot through the atmosphere. 


Players and critics were similarly disappointed by the apparent inability to manually fly between planets in different orbits - instead, the game invites you to pick a destination from your star map or while using your spaceship's scanner HUD, with the journey condensed to a cutscene, again. Well, I bring news on this front. You can actually fly "to" and perhaps even "between" planets in Starfield. But there are some buts. Buts of astronomical dimensions. Onward!

This time, however, he would the playable protagonist. His journey in Mirage takes him from street thief to Hidden Ones order initiate and eventually to the master assassin we see in Valhalla. 
Basim getting his own game is the first time in the franchise’s history that a character who already appeared in a different Assassin’s Creed gets their own mainline game as protagonist. After playing Mirage for roughly two hours for Game Informer's latest cover story, I came away excited to learn more about Basim’s journey and experience his progression, both narratively and mechani…]]></summary>

As the kids might say, I am shook. Besides being a bestest best in class tactics game with great characters, a witty script and deviously designed stealth puzzles to blast and backstab through, Shadow Gambit did that very rare thing that's seemingly eluded both other types of strategy game I've played recently (*cough*The Lamplighters League*cough*), and even Mimimi's own work in the past - and that's teaching you how to actually have fun with its large cast of murder pirates through its brilliantly-conceived bespoke tutorial missions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Newcomer studio Sonka has released a new gameplay trailer for its horror game, Holstin. This new trailer reveals a fun twist on the game’s shooting mechanics and comes alongside word that there’s a demo now available on Steam. 
The trailer is short, running less than a minute, but it showcases the game’s terrifying ambiance, throwback visual style, and zombie-like creatures that have seemingly infested the small 1990s Polish town Holstin is set in. It also highlights that parts of the game are playable as an isometric, third-person shooter like last year’s Signalis and as an over-the-shoulder third-person shooter like in Capcom’s recent Resident Evil remakes. 
Check out the Holstin gameplay reveal trailer for yourself below: 


“A psychological survival horror game set in an eerie, isolated 90’s Polish town consumed by an ominous presence,” the Holstin Steam page reads. “You’ve come looking for answers, but everyone seems possessed by something foul. Explore the festering town, interrogate locals, and fight ungodly manifestations to get to the truth.” 
There’s no release date in sight for Holstin, but you can try the game for yourself today through a demo available on Steam right now. 
Holstin is set to release one day on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC.

Around the turn of the millenium, 1GB sticks were commonplace, and by doubling that amount over time we've gradually worked our way up to 8GB, 16GB and 32GB sticks of DDR4 and DDR5 being common sizes. Now though, DDR5 manufacturers are also producing an intermediate 24GB size, allowing for 48GB kits of two sticks each.
This new capacity requires a BIOS update for most motherboards, but pricing on it can be quite good - and that's what we're seeing today, with extremely rapid DDR5-6400 CL36 RAM available in a 48GB capacity for $130 after a $18 price drop.

Verne Colon The Shape Of Fantasy is, at least in part, an adventure game, and weaker for it. Taken as 'pure' interactive fiction, it'd be shorter and simpler, but might allow its premise, atmosphere, and intriguing world to shine the way they ought to.


The premise actually takes some explaining. Jules Verne himself takes the place of Aronnax, the protagonist of Twenty Thousand Leagues Under The Seas, and instead of mere hermitry, his new submarine home/prison is devoted to a guerrilla war against The Nation, a Prussian-ish empire you might be able to stop using a techno-magical gubbins that allows you to edit reality. Intriguing, right?

A new trailer provides a new look at Gunbrella’s explosive, retro-inspired action. Players control a woodsman seeking revenge for the death of his wife, with players using their weaponized umbrella to blast apart foes or as a platforming tool. For example, you can use the umbrella to glide, swing, or slide around levels, among other uses.


We went hands-on with Gunbrella’s Steam demo and walked away impressed. You can watch us give it a spin in this episode of New Gameplay Today. 
Gunbrella will be available on Switch and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this week I attended a hands-off preview for Owlcat's forthcoming CRPG Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader, which is shaping up nicely, inasmuch as there's anything "nice" about a Warhammer 40,000 game. Rogue Trader is a party-based affair in which you play a sort of Warhammer East India Company, tasked with flipping outlying worlds to the Imperium. In order to carry out this goal, you're granted a lot more individual license than most human residents of the 40K universe. You can, for instance, recruit ungodly xenos to your grimdark troupe, operate a private armada, and even colonise planets and turn them into your own personal piggybank. Just watch you don't push the whole "heresy" thing too far.


I'll have more for you on the subject soonish, but here's an interesting advance snippet from my interview with Owlcat's creative director Alexander Mishulin, in which we discussed what really distinguishes a CRPG from other kinds of role-playing game. According to Mishulin, it's all about designing for choices with consequences that genuinely run the entire length of the game, without (somehow) getting lost in the narrative undergrowth.

You slap on some masks, choose your loadout, then get to robbing banks or stealing things from crates. Often, it ends in absolute chaos as you mow through waves of coppers and rush to a getaway van. The number three might not signal a sweeping change to the formula, then, but that's arguably a good thing. It's a better-looking version of its predecessors that doesn't lose sight of the co-op silliness.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Starfield is finally here after a long five-year wait, and it's great! I’m roughly 23 hours in, so I still have many galaxies ahead of me, but read Game Informer’s Starfield review for in-depth thoughts on the overall package. With years of build-up and anticipation, I, like many Bethesda Game Studios fans, let my imagination run wild with what this new open world RPG could be. Now that I’ve played a decent chunk of it, it’s quite different from the studios’ Elder Scrolls and Fallout series in some ways. Those two franchises are significantly more open world than Starfield. In fact, Starfield feels more like a great sci-fi theme park with exciting points of interests rather than an open world adventure. But players looking for a replica space-based Fallout or Elder Scrolls adventure might …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With Mortal Kombat 1 on the horizon, we're revisiting the entry that set the series on its current trajectory: 2011's Mortal Kombat (aka MK 9). Join us today on Twitch at 2:00 p.m. Central as we take a bloody journey through the game's genre-defining story campaign. Episodes will be uploaded to our Game Informer Shows YouTube channel the following Saturday morning. 
After 2006's Mortal Kombat: Armageddon seemingly concluded the franchise's main narrative, 2011's entry picked up the bloody pieces. It moved the saga forward by resetting the timeline, serving as a soft reboot that brought Mortal Kombat back to its 2D fighting roots and ushering in the return of the classic roster. MK 9's cinematic story mode served as an epiphany for the series and fighting games as a whole, establishing the blueprint for narrative fighting campaigns still utilized today. MK9's story also serves as the first chapter of the modern trilogy of games that Mortal Kombat 1 builds upon. For a whole lot more on MK9 and its development, you can read this feature on how the reboot saved the franchise.
Join editors Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard as they battle their way through MK 9 to see how its reimagined tournament holds up. 
Part 1 - Surpr-iced! 
Part 2 - Bringing The Smoke

The announcement of Super Mario Bros. Wonder, which acted as the grand finale of June's Nintendo Direct, caught many off guard. Not only is Nintendo moving away from the well-worn tread of the New Super Mario Bros. franchise for the 2D side of the series, but it is taking Mario in new directions with a larger roster of playable characters, unprecedented gameplay conventions, and all-new power-ups. The result provided us with a trailer that not only garnered a massive reaction online when our favorite Italian plumber turned into an elephant, but also had us watching the footage on repeat in an attempt to ascertain as many details a…]]></summary>
