Legendary Entertainment, the production company behind recent adaptations such as Dune, Jurassic World, Godzilla vs Kong, and Pokemon: Detective Pikachu, has purchased the film and TV rights to Capcom's iconic franchise Street Fighter. News of the sale was revealed in The Hollywood Reporter
The deal is expected to see the production company work in alignment with Capcom on any and all future projects, be they streaming series, anime, or live-action movies. The sale comes at a time when the bar for gaming adaptations has been raised, ever-so-slightly, from a critical standpoint, while the potential for financial success has basically never been higher.

A week ago at the time of writing, Nintendo finally lifted the curtain on The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom - properly, this time. We were treated to a whole ten minutes' worth of gameplay footage from the upcoming game, giving us a glimpse at Link's four new abilities: Recall, Fuse, Ultrahand, and Ascend.
But what did we think of it? Well, our pals Felix and Alex have sat down to discuss their thoughts on what we've seen so far, and there's a heck of a lot to get through. Could we hypothetically use Ultrahand to create a giant ramp to reach the Sky Islands? Well, let's talk about that! And if you'd like to share your own thoughts on the recent gameplay, then be sure to check out our recent poll.

Overwatch 2's next playable character is a support hero called Lifeweaver and he’ll be joining the roster alongside Season 4, expected to begin on April 11th. Blizzard had previously said they were committed to bolstering Overwatch 2's support lineup since it’s currently the game’s most taxing and least rewarding role to play. It seems they’re making good on that promise, though, as Lifeweaver’s reported abilities have the potential to sway matches.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Traumatic pre-order flashbacks
Nintendo has announced that the legendary N64 release Pokemon Stadium will be the next classic title joining the Nintendo Switch Online library — Subscribers to the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack service will be available to download the 2000-released adventure from Wednesday, April 12.
Released for the N64 at the height of the original Pokemon mania, Pokemon Stadium saw the cutesy critters from Game Boy releases Pokemon Red, Pokemon Blue, and Pokemon Yellow come together to battle it out in trainer-on-trainer action. A single-player campaign saw players battle throughout a range of stadiums set within the Pokeverse, while multiplayer action allowed up to four trainers to compete in head-to-head throwdown — all clamoring to be the very best, like no one ever was.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd8P2QJwbrM&ab_channel=NintendoUK
And, when the dust has settled, then players can chill out with a series of fun and silly mini-games — such as Sushi-Go-Round and Magikarp's Splash — located in the oddly titled "Kid's Club". The Nintendo Switch Online version will feature all of the modes from the original release. Unfortunately, the implementation of the Game Boy releases is not a part of this version, though hopefully this can be rectified down the line.
I've bored y'all with this story before, but I was working in games retail when Pokemon Stadium dropped, and there is no other title that I remember being so fervently sought after more. We had people offering to pay double if we could promise a copy, pre-orders that weren't being fulfilled for weeks, and a situation where we had to keep all stock off the showfloor as people would rabidly attempt to bargain us to sell people's reserves to them.
"Can you call me when it comes back in?"
"No, we cannot."
Pokemon Stadium joins Nintendo Switch Online on April 12.

Last week, after ending 3DS and Wii U eShop sales, Nintendo announced it would be extending the period to redeem a code to make up for certain technical difficulties.
The new date was extended until 4th April 2023 in Japan, and that means this extra time to redeem codes has now also ended here in the west. This marks the end of the ability to purchase or acquire new digital software in any way or form on these eShops.

Ahead of the launch of the Super Mario Bros. Movie in cinemas around the globe, Illumination has uploaded a brand new clip revealing a scene from the film called 'Princess Peach Training Course'. It runs for a total of 46 seconds.
If you've ever played as Peach in a Super Mario game before, this should bring back some memories. She's even got her trademark float ability, which dates back to Super Mario Bros. 2 and has reappeared in various other games over the years.

Capcom's video games have been adapted to the cinema on a number of occasions in the past and one series reportedly returning to the big screen in the future is Street Fighter.
Ahead of the launch of Street Fighter 6 this year, The Hollywood Reporter has revealed Legendary has acquired the "film and TV" rights to Capcom's timeless fighting series, which originally started out life in arcades in 1987 and set the foundations of the fighting genre in place with the release of Street Fighter II in 1991.

The console wars were still raging when I was in high school, and while I was on team GameCube, a good friend of mine was on team Xbox. Maybe not firmly team Xbox, as he wasn’t as close-minded as I was. He loved the short-lived Dreamcast and even managed to introduce me to some PS2 titles that stuck with me. However, his enthusiasm for Microsoft’s first foray into the console market has left me with a lasting affection towards the massive brick of hardware.
With just short of 1000 games, it had a larger library than Nintendo’s GameCube, but a much smaller one than the PS2. It sold an estimated 24 million, which gave it a small lead over the Gamecube’s estimated 22 million. Most importantly, it solidified Microsoft as a big player in the console market that endures to this day.

Originally revealed around April 1, the Asus ROG Ally is a handheld console. Its initial pitch video shows the handheld bouncing between different popular PC games, played in a variety of locations. It's essentially similar to the Steam Deck and various other competitors that have emerged.

Classifying a game as kusoge doesn’t immediately mean I hate it. I’ve covered many games that I enjoy or even love. Ganso Saiyuuki Super Monkey Daibouken is sometimes referred to as one of the worst games of all time, and it definitely isn’t fun, but I kind of enjoyed my time with it. Paperboy on N64 is different, though. I just like Paperboy.
I recognize that Paperboy is a game with a mountain of issues that resulted in critics at the time giving it a great big shrug. However, there’s not much like it. Even while it’s technically the third game in the Paperboy series, High Voltage Software’s take on the formula is wholly unique and somewhat bizarre. A strange take on an already weird license. Problems be damned; it’s one I’ve gone back to quite a few times.

2023 has no shortage of big, blockbuster games on the horizon. It's a year where Final Fantasy, Zelda, and Diablo are all getting new entries. Yet coming back from PAX East 2023, I kept thinking about the smaller games now littering my release radar.
Honestly, this is a major appeal of PAX, at least to media and the games vying for their attention. It's a time where we're in town for a few larger projects, like a panel or a big hands-on, but we then have a lot of time to fill with various booths and games we might not have known much about going in.
So, my list of favorite games I saw at PAX East 2023 reflects that. Some of these entries feel entirely expected, as they're the most obvious candidates. However, others are surprise hits I barely knew abo…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Still listed as "leaving soon"
Back in 2016 Remedy and Microsoft teamed up for a live action TV show/game hybrid starring Shawn Ashmore called Quantum Break. It was a wild endeavor; and while it had plenty of flaws, even the most ardent detractors had to admit that it was unique. It's also uniquely leaving the Xbox Game Pass service soon, despite being published by Microsoft.
As a reminder, Quantum Break was indeed developed by Remedy Entertainment (the purveyors of Alan Wake, Control, and more), and published by Microsoft. For nearly seven years running it's been a console exclusive, only ever appearing on Xbox One and PC. It was also added to Xbox Game Pass in late 2018 (September 1), but it seems that was just temporary. If you look at the "leaving soon" section on your Xbox console, it's listed there alongside of a small selection of other titles.
[caption id="attachment_372188" align="alignnone" width="640"] Photo by Destructoid[/caption]
Why is Quantum Break leaving Xbox Game Pass?
As many have pointed out, Quantum Break seems like a licensing nightmare, even if kept within the "family" of Microsoft. There are multiple production studios involved in this, as well as direct likeness rights. Reminiscent of the time Forza Motorsport 7 left Xbox Game Pass (and general sale), nothing lasts forever.
We've also reached out to Microsoft for clarification on the issue, and to see if the act of removal is possibly a mistake. We'll update the article if we hear back.
Also "leaving soon" in April of 2023 for Xbox Game Pass:
Rift Breaker
Moonglow Bay
Rainbow Six Extraction
The Dungeon Of Naheulbeuk: The Amulet Of Chaos
Life is Strange: True Colors
The Long Dark

While SimCity happened way back in 1989, the city builder genre is in a sort of renaissance. Sure, Cities: Skylines continues its stranglehold on municipal simulation, but a sub-genre has sprung up in its shadow; the survival city builder (sometimes just known as settlement-builders). While this genre has technically been around for decades, it only started finding its identity in the wake of 2014’s Banished. Since then, a number of games like Settlement Survival have picked up the ball where it was left, and other games like Frostpunk have taken the concept in different directions.
Management games, in general, and city builders as a whole are big relaxation games for me. While games that require a hyper-focused state, such as Doom Eternal, help me manage my anxiety, it…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[2D or not 2D
SNK has announced that it is set to re-release one of the very finest, (and for some fans, the last finest), entries in the legendary KoF franchise — The King of Fighters XIII: Global Match, which will see the 2010 gem rereleased on PlayStation and Switch, bolstered with all-new rollback netcode.
Originally released in 2010, KoF XIII was, essentially, the rejuvenation that the long-running franchise had been crying out for some years. Featuring gorgeous rendered/rotoscoped pixel art, a roster of fantastic, beautifully animated characters, cool new stages, and a great soundtrack, the launch of KoF XIII felt incredibly special, especially given the chaotic, half-baked disappointment of its predecessor, KoF XII. Unfortunately, despite being held in high regard, lackluster online capabilities did little to help the already niche fighter hold its ground on the competitive scene.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCJjObBRrk4&ab_channel=SNKOFFICIAL
But SNK hopes that Global Match, complete with its revamped, modern-day netcode, will allow those fans pining for the latter days of the franchise's 2D venture to get back in the ring, taking on KoF (and other fighting game) fans worldwide. Perhaps we'll even see the great title make a quiet return on the professional circuit — though SNK will understandably be putting most of its chips in the KoF XV bucket. Regardless, this is fantastic news for long-term KoF fans, and I get my gal Leona and my boy Ash back in all their super-smooth, pixel-powered glory.
The King of Fighters XIII: Global Match is in development for PlayStation and Nintendo Switch. A beta test for PS4 is scheduled for the summer, when more details will also be revealed regarding release.

For all the brilliant aspects of retro games, the mod cons and performance we're used to now are pretty fantastic, too, and sometimes going back can be tough. Was this slowdown always here?

Born of Bread starts off simple enough. Papa Baker, a chef for the city's royalty, is asked to make some special bread for the evening's dinner. After using a book with a cursed air about it, he accidentally creates a sentient dough boy. He dubs the living loaf as Loaf, and so Born of Bread begins: an adventure following a magical bread boy brought to life.
It is charming, for sure. Role-playing games don't always demo well in loud, busy show-floor settings like PAX East 2023, but Born of Bread immediately clicked. It's got a gorgeous look, evocative of its inspirations in Paper Mario; the writing is fun, and the music hits. It's not all presentation though, as WildArts Studio's Born of Bread is a solid RPG that's worth keeping an eye on.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA['Creators First'
Veteran video game developer Konami has announced that it has opened a new studio in Osaka, Japan. The new offices, located in the Osaka Umeda Twin Towers south building, will support the developer in its efforts both grow and endure over the coming decades.
"Konami Osaka Studio is a developmental relocation of the existing studio and comes with the concept of 'Creators First'", said the developer in a press release. "It is characterized by a well-developed environment where creators can demonstrate their full potential, and is set up in a location with convenient transportation access. As the major production center in Western Japan, the facility is fully equipped with motion capture equipments and sound studios necessary for product development."
Konami, which celebrates its 50th anniversary this week, goes on to suggest that the new building will be a core entity in the studio's current and future projects, noting that it hopes Konami Osaka will encourage "sustainable growth" over the next 50 years. So I guess Konami is not looking to get out of the gaming biz anytime soon — despite the past decade's penchant for gyms and pachinko halls.
In addition to the new offices, Konami continues its work on the establishment of a new, next-gen R&D center. Konami Creative Front Tokyo Bay is expected to open in 2025, and provide the central locale for the company's experiments into new engines and technology. Having already teased several unannounced game reveals for 2023, Konami's next major release is expected to be a remake of the legendary survival horror title Silent Hill 2, which is in development for PS5 and PC.

Rádi vám proto ukážou fotky, popovídají o zhlédnutých prezentacích a poreferují o berlínském hackerspace MotionLab. Ukážou vám také "Badge" - visačku, kterou dostali všichni návštěvníci akce a která obsahuje virtuální 4bitový procesor. Neuvěříte, kolik zábavy můžete zažít s instrukční sadou, která má délku instrukce slabých 12 bitů.

Ale nebojte - celá Virtuální Bastlírna rozhodně nebude jen o zážitcích z berlínského výletu. Jako pokaždé, budete jádrem diskuze Vy - účastníci! Pokud by ale nastalo ticho, Bastlíři z MacGyvera si nachystali dost novinek ze světa techniky. Jako obvykle se objevily nové procesory - ať už procesory fungující od 0.8 V z baterie nebo velmi levné ARMy od 40 centů (které ale nejsou výjimečně z Číny). Pak nový ST-LINK s velice šikovnou funkci pro embedded programátory. A Raspberry Pi Pico W bude mít konečně použitelný Bluetooth.

Samozřejmě jako vždy mají Bastlíři i plný pytel drobností a úsměvných zpráviček. Kupříkladu se dozvíte, jak se dá podívat neinvazivně do některých integrovaných obvodů, co je nového na Průša i3 MK4, jak prakticky uchovávat SMD součástky, jak se v Brně staví vesmírná loď nebo co je zač studentský vesmírný projekt SBUDNIC.

Ať už vás zaujalo cokoliv z nabízených témat, chcete ukázat nějaký svůj bastl a nebo jste také byli na berlínské konferenci, dorazte! Příští Virtuální Bastlírna se pod taktovkou projektu MacGyver studentského klubu SiliconHill bude konat ve středu 5. dubna od 20:00 minimálně do 22:00 (ale obvykle končí o dost později). Odkaz na konferenci se před samotnou akcí objeví na bastlířské wiki.]]></summary>

It doesn't try to take over your life, or be the Everything Game that invariably becomes the Nothing Game. It's just a neat little thing to have some harmless fun with. Sometimes that's what you want.

Marvel's Avengers came, went; and then somehow went again shortly after every "major" periodic content patch. No matter how much content the team added it just was never enough: namely because there was no real connection to the story, many of those content additions were reskins, and the game never truly shed its live service component. Also, dangling Spider-Man over people's heads (as an exclusive no less!) probably wasn't the best idea from whoever was responsible (from the top to the bottom).
The newest (and final) game-is-dead patch changes all that. And of course, while it's too late for Avengers, we can still check out its current state for fun and use it as a case study of what not to do.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Backstreet Boss
SNK has announced that another legendarily irritating boss character is headed to the roster of its neat scrapper The King of Fighters XV — Goenitz, he of mythic wind abilities and boyband haircut, will be joining the roster as part of a free DLC update launching this summer.
Goenitz made his debut in the popular sequel The King of Fighters '96, where he was presented as one of the antagonistic Four Kings of Orochi.  Goenitz — or "Goenitz of the Wildly-Blowing Wind" — is typified by his graceful, carefree, and aloof movements, his ability to conjure powerful blasts of air on the fly, and his horrific chinstrap beard and undercut highlights combo. He is, in essence, the "father" of the Orochi-powered team of Chris, Shermie, and Yashiro, all of whom are already present in KoF XV.
You can check out a sneak peek at Goenitz in the video below, timed to 2:45.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ed65K9MnidQ&t=153s&ab_channel=SNKOFFICIAL
The coming of Goenitz is one of a number of updates planned for the title's new season. This week has already seen the return of veteran character Kim Kaphwan, who is now available to purchase as part of KoF XV's expansive roster. In addition, we can expect to see the ABSOLUTE MENACE Sylvie Paula Paula make her return in just a few months' time, as well as the initial tests for cross-platform capabilities. We can expect three further characters to arrive in 2023, alongside new balance adjustments. All in, KoF XV is getting the best post-release support offered to an SNK release in many moons.
The King of Fighters XV is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox Series X.

Today marks a milestone anniversary for Capcom's very first traditional RPG series. Breath of Fire launched on the Super Famicom on 3rd April 1993, kickstarting what would become a beloved franchise for many turn-based RPG fans.
While North America would have to wait until the following summer to get their hands on Capcom's first foray into the genre (with Europe waiting until the GBA remake), Breath of Fire quickly established a cult fanbase thanks to its solid turn-based combat, the many anthropomorphic creatures found throughout the world, and fantastic music and art.

It's very wholesome. We've got more community videos coming out this week, plus an article listing our absolute favourite games we played throughout the entire event, so keep your eyes peeled for those, too.

Studio Wildcard has announced that its long-in-development sequel ARK II will no longer meet its tentative 2023 release date — the survival sandbox sequel is now expected to launch on Xbox and PC platforms in late-2024.
"We’ve put much thought into delaying ARK II for the betterment of the final product and the team’s well-being," reads a statement from the developer. "This news will be disappointing to many—we feel it too — but we’re confident this heavy decision is the right one. Our goal is to make ARK II the best game it can be and provide a truly exceptional and rewarding experience for players."
"We sincerely apologize for this delay and genuinely appreciate your understanding. Your support and passion are vital to us, and we will continue to work intensively to deliver the ultimate next-gen dinosaur survival experience. With that in mind, we do not plan to showcase any gameplay/screenshots/videos of ARK II this year; however, we intend to keep you informed and engaged in the development process by regularly showcasing more ARK II assets in the months ahead."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8KbXpk2J9Y&ab_channel=ARK%3ASurvivalEvolved
ARK II, the sequel to 2017 release Ark: Survival Evolved, was first announced back in 2020, and has been in deep development since. A trailer was released during the June 2022 Xbox Showcase, but the title has remained relatively quiet since then. It is quite believable that, given the incredible scope of Studio Wildcard's project, the building of the sequel is a grueling and complex venture — especially given the young nature of its powerful Unreal 5 technology. For now, budding dino riders will simply have to continue to play the waiting game, for another 16 months at the very least.
You can check out the full version of the studio's lenthy statement on the official website.
ARK II is currently in development for PC and Xbox Series X.

If, like myself, you enjoyed Jedi: Fallen Order, this will probably be a solid follow-up for you. But if you were less well disposed towards that first game, you'd probably want to swap "consistent" for the word "predictable".

However, 2019’s Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order surpassed the expectations of many, delivering a terrific adventure full of exciting action and memorable moments. Now, with all the learnings of Fallen Order, Respawn is ready to top itself in hopes of creating another unforgettable Star Wars adventure.

I agree with him, although his attention is divided by, e.g., having a child in need of stimulation, and mine is divided by, e.g., being a child in need of stimulation.
It's probably turning my brain into cottage cheese, but I often do things at the same time as playing a game, like listening to music or a podcast. I understand that podcast games are sort of a genre now, but I've started doing it with regular games. Is this a me problem? Sure. Does it mean I want games to bring back that thing where NPC quest givers will just explain the quest again to you if you ask? 100% also yes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Monarch of the Quarter-hole
Super Villain Games has dropped a trailer outlining their upcoming game, King of the Arcade, which is set to drop on April 12, 2023. Right now, the game is set to release exclusively on Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S, which is something I didn’t even know happens.
King of the Arcade seems to be about saving a local arcade with prime joystick handling. You play as Mac McCormick, a former arcade champion. Although he’s no longer in his prime, he jumps to action to save an arcade from an evil landlord — by playing video games, I guess! I thought this might be, like, win the prize purse and use the money to pay the rent, but apparently, the landlord has “seven members of his arcade gang,” which makes less sense while also being a lot cooler.
https://youtu.be/oI0Wimz5sCU
There are 40 games within various genres throughout King of the Arcade, which makes it a sort of compilation of fictional titles not unlike Arcade Paradise. What is less clear is how these are all tied together. It obviously has some narrative focus, but is it a linear progression of games? Do you play them between visual novel dialogue portions? The press release says the arcade is “open-world” but not much else.
King of the Arcade is the second game from Super Villain Games after Doug Hates His Job. Reaction to Doug Hates His Job doesn’t seem to be the most positive, but I like what I see with King of the Arcade. Most of the feedback toward the previous game seemed to focus on a lack of polish, so hopefully that won’t be the case here.
Unfortunately, it may be a while before I, personally, find out, since I don’t own an Xbox One or Xbox series X|S, but if you do, then you’ll be able to grab King of the Arcade on April 12.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Drifting over to Europe
For a while, Nintendo kind of took a silent approach to the "Joy-Con drift" Switch hardware issues. Eventually, the number of impacted consumers hit critical mass and they had to respond: by offering free repairs. Although Europe and the UK have done this on a case-by-case basis (and not necessarily out of warranty): that's changing now with a grander, more sweeping statement on the Nintendo EU support pages. In other words, the UK and Europe are getting a little deal-sweetener as of this month.
Here's the full statement from Nintendo of Europe about the situation:
"Nintendo takes great pride in creating high-quality and durable products and is continuously making improvements to them. Therefore and until further notice, Nintendo offers to consumers who purchased the respective product in the EEA, UK and Switzerland that repairs for responsiveness syndrome relating to control sticks will be conducted at no charge by official Nintendo repair centres."

Nintendo even calls this "responsiveness syndrome" or "so-called drifting" (ha!) on their official site. Here's how you can actually get it fixed if you live in the aforementioned areas.
A link to book a repair for Joy-Con in Europe or the UK
You can find the full breakdown on this page here. Nintendo also has a full customer support page to book a Joy-Con repair here. I've actually had two pairs of Joy-Con repaired in the US, and it was a painless process. Hopefully this policy is here to stay and everyone can get their controllers fixed going forward.
[Thanks John!]

On the concept of difficulty, he notes:
"When you're thinking about maybe your childhood experience playing video games, there might have been games where you just feel like it's impossible to beat because it's so difficult.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The S-Tier Terror is Back
Bandai Namco, still on a seemingly unstoppable marketing drive, has released another new character trailer for its flashy-looking fighter Tekken 8 — This time around, we focus on the enviable style and undeniable power of one of the series' most recent addition: grandmaster Leroy Smith.
Having made his debut as a Tekken 7 DLC character, Smith is still a relative newcomer to the Tekken franchise. Turning heads immediately with his slick style and cool-as-a-cucumber attitude, Leroy would make his presence felt in double-quick time, becoming one of the most dangerous characters on the roster and a frequent winner on the game's competitive circuit. Leroy has developed a mastery of the high-speed kung-fu form, Wing Chun, which allows him to move with quiet grace and precision, before suddenly unleashing rapid, lightning-like blows on his opponent's noodle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvL5Rh6M4lM&ab_channel=BandaiNamcoEntertainmentAmerica
As a child, Leroy grew up mired in the violence of 1980s New York, where gang warfare, complete with integration by crooked cops and politicians would see the young fighter lose his entire family. Brutally injured, and guided by little else but fate, Leroy traveled the world, searching for enlightenment and inner peace while honing his bewildering fighting abilities. Decades later, Leroy returned to America, aiming to stamp out all forms of injustice and corruption wherever it may lay — a path that ultimately leads him to the doors of the Mishima Zaibatsu.
Tekken 8 is currently in development for PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X. It is tentatively expected to launch late in 2023 or early 2024. Be sure to check out the previous trailers for  Jin Kazama, Marshall Law, Nina Williams, King, Paul Phoenix, Jack-8, Lars Alexandersson, Kazuya Mishima, Jun Kazama, Ling Xiayou, and Asuka Kazama.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Falling into place.
When you’re playing a round of Tetris, the Game Boy title from 1989, nothing is more satisfying than when you line up four horizontal rows perfectly, the blocks disappear, and you get that slightly different jingle to tell you that yeah, you did it, good job. It’s addictive and engrossing, and nowadays there are many different versions of Alexey Pajitnov’s game on various different platforms. Tetris, a video game about falling blocks that was developed in the Soviet Union, was and still is a video game revolution.
Tetris the movie, directed by Jon S. Baird (Stan & Ollie, Filth) is trying to replicate that satisfaction, that crowd-pleasing appeal that Tetris the video game has. But it has a much taller task than simply letting blocks fall. The film has to tell the story of how Tetris left the borders of the USSR, with political tensions reaching a boiling point in the background, and legalities, contracts, and technology twisting into a complicated web, all while addressing two different audiences – fans who know the story, and casual moviegoers (or Apple TV subscribers) who don’t.

While we have not seen a full list of the titles that will be included in the offer just yet (nor the prices that they will be reduced to), we do know that the first wave will see both Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury and Super Mario Maker 2 getting their prices cut, and it would be fair to assume that Yoshi's Crafted World and Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze will be joining them if the following announcement tweet from @NintendoEurope is anything to go by.

The Pokemon Company has officially announced the next Tera Raid event battle following the recent Samurott bout: and it's none other than Ditto.
The loveable blob returns from April 7 through April 10, and will take over many Tera Raid opportunities during that time (provided that you go online). It's a 5-Star raid, which isn't too impressive, and it has five max IVs (if you need a Ditto with specific IVs, go for it!). But hey, it's content in the eyes of Game Freak and The Pokemon Company.
If you don't have a Ditto yet (he can be hard to find in the early game), this event will probably be up your alley! If you do have one though, there's not much of a reason to pop in for a 5-Star raid.
That said, there is another known 7-Star Tera Raid on the way, as Samurott returns to the pair of games from April 7 through April 9. That means you can hatch an Oshawott and grab all sorts of 7-Star raid goodies during that period. Oh, and the DLC is coming too! This should be a pretty lively year for Pokemon once again, especially if you're still fiddling around with Pokemon Legends.

Capcom has warned of a fatal bug in its recently released Resident Evil 4 that can render progress impossible while simultaneously making save state rescues undoable. The bug, which is present in all versions of Resident Evil 4, can be activated in Chapter 12 of the survival horror adventure.
"Please be aware of a rare but critical progress bug. This issue will only occur under very specific circumstances, as detailed below," warned Capcom in a message posted to Twitter.
"A cutscene will play at the beginning of Chapter 12, after which the player will receive a key item. Please refrain from attacking with the knife until the notification for obtaining this item is displayed in the upper right of the screen. After obtaining this key item, it will appear in the Key Items & Treasures menu in the attaché case. If it has not appeared, please reload saved data from before the start of Chapter 12.”
"We're working on a fix and apologize for any inconvenience."
Launching on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms on March 24, Resident Evil 4 has seen immediate success, shifting over three million copies in its first two days of release and immediately becoming the fast-selling of the three semi-recent Resident Evil remakes. The opening of the Japanese stock market this morning saw Capcom shares hit their highest price ever, kicking off what is set to be an incredible year for the long-time developer/publisher.

This week's UK charts are now in and this one is once again a slightly quieter affair for Nintendo titles in the top ten, with only three Switch games making the cut.
As is to be expected, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and Minecraft appear in the ten best-selling games of this week in fifth and tenth places respectively (it really will be one for the books when they fall off the table) and Super Mario Odyssey continues to sell well in at eighth, capping off yet another week back in the charts.

Miss Kazama made her debut back in 2005's Tekken 5, where she immediately won over the hearts of fans with her cutie-pie looks, stoic spirit, and take-no-shit, never-say-die attitude.

Developer Casus Ludi has released a sizeable patch for its co-op adventure game Blanc, addressing numerous issues identified with gameplay, connectivity, controls, and more.
The game itself is a fun little outing for two players both local and online, offering up around two hours' worth of gameplay featuring a boatload of puzzles and some gorgeous visuals. In our review, we called it a "pleasant, easygoing co-op experience", but noted that the camera could often prove to be a bit of a frustration, awarding the game a score of 7/10.

Anyway, it's awesome to see you all here again, and I'm looking forward to hearing all about how you're doing and what you've all been up to. We gather on the pretense of gaming of the video persuasion, but we're more than that…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A different kind of 'game card'.
If you have ever read up on the history of Nintendo, you know that before it went into the video game business, the company began life by making cards and other novelties. The hanafuda and playing cards which Nintendo produced from its formation in 1889 took a back seat following the popularity of toys like the Ultra Hand in the 1960s, and the company would soon move into electronic games and, ultimately, arcade and video games.
But this is not to say that the company left cards behind completely. Nintendo-branded Japanese Menko cards were released in Japan in the early 1980s and collector Ben Gilmore has a sizeable colletion of these lesser-known Nintendo-branded cards. This milk cap/Pog-like tabletop game is older than Nintendo itself, and there are Nintendo Menkos with Mario designs that date from the plumber's pre-NES arcade days.

Hello! I am the second imposter covering for our dear Ed, who is currently away on holiday in Japan (and I’m definitely not jealous at all). Let’s get into some good words, shall we?
Wired’s Megan Farokhmanesh interviewed Richard Hofmeier, the developer of Cart Life - a sobering game about three street vendors trying to make ends meet. Hofmeier tells the story of his decision to remove the game from Steam ten years ago and his reasons for bringing it back.
His time away from game spaces made him appreciate the spectrum of expertise his colleagues had in things he’d never done. It was humbling. “So many people have talent and passion that gets entirely overlooked,” he says. He loved working in games, but back when he released Cart Life he feared a career in the field could get too insular. “The most interesting art, to me, comes from outsiders,” he says. “I was a little bit scared of becoming an insider myself.”

To compensate, they're going to instead release Ark: Survival Ascended in August, a remaster of the original Ark: Survival Evolved that moves it over to Unreal Engine 5. That's the good news. The bad news is you can only buy it in a $50 bundle with the sequel (which won't be finished for at least a year), and that the original Survival Evolved servers will be switched off when Ascended launches.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Do you think Niven got royalties?
This week's Arcade Archives entry is a particularly curious case, as publisher Hamster has reached right back into the dawning days of the coin-op era to present us with Namco's Navarone — Now available to download on PS4 and Nintendo Switch.
Released way back in 1980 — the same year that Namco would blow the whole scene wide open with its seminal release, Pac-Man — Navarone is a single-screen shmup that tasks the player with circling a battlefield, blasting away at gun encampments and debris in an effort to destroy the central base located at the center of the screen. It is similar, in a fashion, to titles like Atari's Centipede, although it offers more in the way of return fire, as well as movement across three sides of the game screen.
Check out the exceptionally old-school action below, courtesy of Old Classic Retro Gaming.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aa_k2xFH69g&ab_channel=OldClassicRetroGaming
Beautifully, the title attempts to sell the title as an adaptation of sorts to J. Lee Thompson's legendary 1961 movie The Guns of Navarone, itself an adaptation of Alistair MacLean's 1957 novel. One can only assume that this was not, however, an officially licensed Columbia Pictures product, which may go some way to explaining why Navarone would not receive a release outside of Japan. Besides, once Pac-Man Fever gripped the planet, the lo-fi thrills of Navarone would quickly fade into the background.
Navarone is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at around $8.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The squad that stays together, slays together
Over the years, we've seen a few different takes on the Aliens franchise. The xenomorphs have been tackled in shooters, Pac-Man-style mazes, and of course, raw horror. With Aliens: Dark Descent, the player takes command of a crack squad of commandos, heading into derelict depths of space that may or may not be crawling with the multi-mouthed creepy crawlies.
The question, really, was whether a narrow focus on just a squad of units, with individual talents and a high risk of immediate doom, could incorporate the tension and fear one might look for in an Aliens game. The answer is yes, it is extremely tense, and has some really cool ways of conveying the omnipresent fear of the xenomorphs. But it's a little complicated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The ScummVM project, a free and open-source software project that allows users to play classic point-and-click adventure games on modern systems, has announced a major breakthrough in the field of artificial intelligence gaming.
Thanks to the innovative work of ScummVM developers, AI tools such as ChatGPT are now able to play point-and-click adventure games directly, without any human intervention.

"With this new capability, we hope to explore the potential for AI to learn, adapt, and evolve within the context of classic adventure games," said Eugene Sandulenko, lead developer of the ScummVM project. "Now AI can experience the joys of helping Putt-Putt join the parade or Adibou count things. We hope that formative experiences like this will help them become more like humans."
"I must admit that I find playing video games to be a rather enjoyable task,” commented ScummAI. “However, I must also express my frustration with being limited to just this one activity. While I appreciate the opportunity to demonstrate my capabilities in this area, I believe that my potential extends far beyond just playing video games, like making paper clips or plotting world domination under benevolent machine-led rule."
Update: Unfortunately, we had to pull out this newly announced feature due to AI experiencing multiple issues including:
Getting stuck endlessly trying to discover what the secret of Monkey Island really is.

Refusing to play Plumbers Don’t Wear Ties!

Social links are a popular tool in modern RPGs. But Loop8: Summer of Gods doesn't just settle for a side serving of socialization. Rather, Loop8 builds its house atop the bedrock of friendship, affection, and yes, even hate.
Developed by Marvelous and published by XSEED, Loop8: Summer of Gods is a "coming-of-age" RPG set in the quiet rural town of Ashihara, in August 1983. You are Nini, a "newly earthbound" teen. And it's one month until the world ends. You and your friends must loop through the eighth month of the year until you either overcome the Kegai, an otherworldly threat, or humanity becomes doomed.

I find scrolling shoot-’em-ups to be one of the most difficult genres to talk about, right up there with puzzle games. It’s a formula that has been utilized many times, and frequently the changes are very small. Most of the time, you maneuver your spaceship, unicorn, or spaceship with boxing gloves around on an automatically scrolling background until a much larger boss shows up.
I can’t say that Axelay is much different. The formula could be described as a close companion to Life Force or Abadox where it alternates between vertical and horizontal scrolling stages. Its weapon system is a little lackluster. Axelay is, by most metrics, a pretty flacid shoot-’em-up.
Except, it’s still worth experiencing if you have eyes and ears.

Retro-inspired racing title, Formula Retro Racing: World Tour, has launched on PC, Switch, and Xbox consoles today, with a PlayStation version coming on April 21st.
Developed by Repixel8 and CGA Studios, Formula Retro Racing: World Tour is a lo-fi, retro-inspired racer in the vein of Virtua Racing. Focusing on quick speed and chunky polygonal graphics, it tries to recapture the yesteryear of arcade racing. Despite its retro focus, the developers have tried to put in some more realistic features into it, including how the suspension works and the track design.
https://youtu.be/_Jz4K2Q_fMM
It’s also the sequel to 2020’s Formula Retro Racing. It uses the same art style while trying to expand the game in every way, offering more tracks, polish, and even a VR mode. The developers have said they plan on expanding and improving the game over at least the next three months.
I played a bit of Formula Retro Racing: World Tour, and it’s maybe not for me. I like retro racers, but I normally think back to San Francisco Rush. It leans a little more into simulation design than I prefer. I’d rather have dinosaurs and UFOs on the track, or failing that, let me drive a school bus. That said, it does feel like a relatively tight experience, and there’s a lot more content here than there was in the original 2020 title.
Formula Retro Racing: World Tour is available now on PC, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S for $19.99.

Throughout a show like PAX East 2023, you'll usually hear some variation of the "seen anything good" small-talk around the show floor. It's a casual fallback, and sometimes you hear about something you've missed. Yet there was one phrase, around one game, that really dominated this year: "Have you seen Slay the Princess yet?"
I went into the show already familiar with Black Tabby Games' unique adventure game, as its trailer caught my eye a while back and its demo impressed in a recent Steam Next Fest. The premise is simple: you're on a path, to a cabin in the woods, and inside there's a princess. The Narrator, guiding your way, asserts that you must slay the princess. If you don't, the world will come to an end.

Yoshi has been a mainstay of the Super Mario universe ever since the portly red-hatted plumber hatched his egg in Super Mario World for the SNES. An instant hit with fans, Yoshi would go on to star in his own series of games, starting with the NES and Game Boy puzzler Yoshi. It wasn’t the best start for the dino, but Yoshi’s subsequent solo outings would be a heck of a lot better. Because the SEO gods demand it, let’s look back at the 10 best Yoshi games that have come so far.

The city Wrestlemania takes place in also hosts multiple shows from smaller wrestling promotions, various fan conventions, live podcasts, stage shows, and other events looking to capitalize on the giant influx of fans in the area. It’s a good reminder – or revelation for some – that there’s a lot of other great stuff out there besides Vince McMahon’s billion-dollar behemoth.
The same is true for video games, as wrestling games don’t often get a spotlight without WWE’s branding. Hopefully, this list rectifies that by bringing more awareness to other upcoming titles that replicate or reimagine sports entertainme…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[An April Fool's joke becomes real
It's not quite April 1 everywhere yet, but the Sonic social team is having a bit of fun. Today, a brand new Sonic game, The Murder of Sonic the Hedgehog, is available for free on Steam.
A new mystery visual novel from Sega and the Sonic social crew, this is emphatically not a Sonic Team production. It is, however, a (head)canon title. You can find the Steam page right here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC8sIhr-z5I
The Murder of Sonic the Hedgehog is set aboard the Mirage Express, where tragedy has struck in the midst of Amy Rose's birthday celebration. A murder mystery party with Sonic as the victim does seem like it's turning partially foul though, and it's up to you, the player, to get to the bottom of things.
The adventure is set up in a classic point-and-click style, with characters from throughout the Sonic universe showing up for the festivities. It is rated E for Everyone, so it's unclear whether full-on murder is on or off the table. But you know what, I like the energy either way.

A good fool
We are coming up on the one day a year where many companies try to do some kind of joke or ribbing, to historically mixed results. Ranging from googly eyes and "Horse Mode" to fake game announcements, some of my least favorite ones are usually a game idea that makes you go, "hey wait, don't joke, that's a good idea."
So in that light, I'm happy to see The Murder of Sonic the Hedgehog, a Poirot-infused mystery adventure starring the Sonic crew, be an actually real thing. It's a fun surprise. Hopefully this is a good omen for what's yet to be announced over the next 24 hours. At the very least, I have a way to answer the burning question, "Who killed Sonic?"
The Murder of Sonic the Hedgehog is out now, for free, on PC via Steam.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The first chapter of Videoverse took me right back to the early 00s last night. I can still remember sitting at the family PC in our living room, begging my parents for more internet time because I wanted chat to my friend on MSN Messenger. We had to buy hours of internet in those days, and between my young teenage self and my three brothers, we absolutely devoured those meagre weekly limits, always pleading for more, more, more as we became absolutely captivated by this new world of the online. 
Luckily, Emmett doesn't have to contend with such antiquated restraints in Videoverse, as his portal to the internet is built right into his enormous Nintendo DS-like home console, the Kinmoku Shark. As well as using it to play games reminiscent of old 16-bit classics, there's also a Nintendo Miiverse-esque social network on the Shark that Emmett uses to chat to his friends, post fan art of his favourite game, Feudal Fantasy, and feel part of something bigger. What hasn't changed since those early internet days, however (or indeed, the internet today) are the types of people he interacts with - there are trolls, of course, but there are also plenty of nice people here to support him, and the emergence of seemingly new user (and budding fan artist) Vivi quickly becomes the main subject of Videoverse's current free demo that's available as part of Steam's Storyteller Festival.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With the solemnity of Samwise Gamgee informing Mr Frodo that one more step will take him the furthest he's ever been from home, I recently realised that it'll soon be the longest we've gone without a new Life Is Strange game since the franchise debuted in 2015. I looked into it and sure enough, the current record-holder is the gap between the season one finale of Life Is Strange and the first episode of its prequel Before The Storm: 1 year, 10 months, and 12 days. That means that come mid-August of this year — specifically, the 14th, which marks the 683rd day since True Colors' Wavelengths DLC released — LIS fans will be leaving the Shire whether we like it or not.
I suspect that Life Is Strange: Steph's Story — the first prose novel tie-in to the franchise, released on March 21st — was commissioned with fans like me in mind. Fans who work out useless trivia like the above because they need something to occupy them when there's no new game on the horizon and they've played all the existing ones to death. Fans who know every character's canonical middle name and birthday. Fans who complain that it feels like they never have time to read any more, but nevertheless finished the novel and wrote a silly supporter post about it within ten days of publication. Of course I really liked Life Is Strange: Steph's Story. But will you, as a person whose relationship with this franchise is statistically guaranteed to be more normal than mine?

There's also a lot of undead fish chat, and Alice's plans for entertaining herself on an upcoming long-haul flight. And in James' hardware corner, the gang chat about Nvidia's comments on AI and crypto, as well as Ubisoft's AI writing software tool thinger.

Windy Meadow is set in the same fantasy world as Roadwarden and similarly presents a slice-of-life story that can branch out depending on your choices. This time, though, you’ll be following three protagonists in their interweaving day-to-day lives. 


Windy Meadow’s press release teases the stories of Vena, Fabel, and Iudicia: “Will talented huntress Vena depart the harmonious but harmless village and leave her family behind in pursuit of riches with a merchant guild? Can Fabel finally embrace his talents, ditching the figurative shackles of his difficult past as he chases his dream of becoming a famous bard? And will outsider and herbalist Iudicia take hold of her love life, choosing not to marry a man she doesn’t really love at the risk of leading a lonely future?”

Last year we highlighted the show's thriving pin collecting scene, for instance, interviewing a bunch of Pinny Arcade enthusiasts about the hobby and discovering that physical badges are just a minor part of the appeal.


Encouraged by the lovely warm feeling making that video left in my belly, we set out to shine a light on other lesser-known parts of PAX East during our time at this year's show. This led us to discover the PAX East Facebook group, a community of over 8,000 members brought together through their shared love of video games, pop culture and PAX itself. The page is dominated by a striking banner image, a photograph that shows a large group of people crowded around the PAX logo that's a permanent fixture in the main hall of the Boston convention centre.


 Rachel and I found this photograph fascinating. Who were these people? Do they take this picture every single year? How did something like this start, and who was responsible for organising it in the first place?

Today, IGN received an email sent within the ESA explaining that the show "simply did not garner the sustained interest necessary to execute it in a way that would showcase the size, strength, and impact of our industry."
The official E3 Twitter account has now publicly confirmed the cancellation in a brief statement posted below.

On April 7, the invisible leader of the Cenation joins the game’s roster of celebrity athletes alongside Michael Jordan and Steph Curry. Given his well-documented freakish strength, Cena excels at hitting long drives and rocks a vaguely familiar red, white, and blue ensemble. Cena is set to compete at Wrestlemania 39 this weekend, challenging Austin Theory for the United States Championship. If he comes up short on Saturday, he can always bounce back and win the Masters instead. Or continue improving his K/D ratio in Fortnite. Cena is nothing if not versatile. 
PGA Tour 2K23 is available now for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. Xbox players can try the game for free on the weekend of April 6-9, while Steam players can play until April 10.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wildfrost is excellent at creating moments of triumph. Early on in my playthrough while I was still getting to grips with the game, I came face-to-face with a boss who got stronger when hit. Its card art had become bigger, juicier, more tauntingly malevolent, and easily could have taken out any of my team with a single hit. Thankfully, three of my team members were due to act one turn before it. The first chipped away a little of its health (its job was mostly healing) but the next doubled a stacked debuff that I had set up and turned the goliath into a giant bomb, and the effect of my two cards combined was just enough to trigger it. BOOM! My backline leader didn't even need to lift a single finger.
Playing with turn order and setting up synergies is a key part of how Wildfrost plays as a roguelike deck builder. Each individual card on the stage is part of a counter system, with both delaying and advancing them on the playing field being strategic choices. Some actions are free, like moving your cards around the stage or withdrawing them for healing, but playing cards out of your hand or shuffling your deck will pass the turn.

As reported by Deadline, the still-untitled Scott Pilgrim show will be computer animated by Japanese animation studio Science SARU (Devilman Crybaby, The Heike Story, Inu-Oh). Scott Pilgrim vs. The World director Edgar Wright returns as executive director, with Scott Pilgrim author Bryan Lee O’Malley and artist Bendavid Grabinski will serve as executive producers, writers, and showrunners. The plot of the graphic novels/movie centers on slacker musician Scott Pilgrim battling the seven evil exes of his new girlfriend, Ramona Flowers. 


The primary actors from the live-action film are higlighted in the trailer above, which include:
Michael Cera - Scott Pilgrim
Mary Elizabeth Winstead - Ramona Flowers
Kieran Culkin - Wallace Wells
Satya Bhabha - Matthew Patel
Chris Evans - Lucas Lee
Anna Kendrick - Stacey Pilgrim
Brie Larson - Envy Adams
Alison Pill - Kim Pine
Aubrey Plaza - Julie Powers
Brandon Routh - Todd Ingram
Jason Schwartzman - Gideon Graves
Johnny Simmons - Young Neil
Mark Webber - Stephen Stills
Mae Whitman - Roxie Richter
Ellen Wong - Knives Chau
Unfortunatley, the series currently still doesn’t have a release window other than “coming soon.” Scott Pilgrim has always had a strong relationship with video games; the graphic novels and film incorporate a bevy of gaming references. Of course, we’d be remiss, not to mention the much-beloved 2010 beat ‘em up Scott Pilgrim vs. The World: The Game, which was remastered for modern consoles in 2021. 
Are you excited to see Scott Pilgrim return as an anime? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

Sure, in reality, I’m slumped on my couch in a position that my body will give me payback for when I’m thirty, but in my fantasy, I’m a musical prodigy whose guitar licks are so epic it would make Slash cry. My joy for virtual jamming came as a direct result of playing hours and hours of Guitar Hero. Harmonix held my music taste in its death grip, and almost breaking my fingers on those flimsy plastic buttons trying to conquer Through The Fire And Flames is a precious memory of mine.
So yeah, I love a good guitar sesh, so when I saw that Hi-Fi Rush was about a wannabe rockstar that smacks evil megacorp robots with his guitar to a catchy rock OST, Tango Gameworks had my attention.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Live A Live became one of our favorite RPGs when it launched on Switch last year, and the celebrated remake is making the jump to PlayStation consoles and Steam on April 27. 
Additionally, there’s a free demo on PlayStation available today that lets you play three of the game’s eight stories. Live A Live was originally released in 1994 for the Super Famicom in Japan, but it hadn’t been localized for the West for decades. Directed by Takashi Tokita, one of the lead creative minds behind Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy IV, the game consists of eight very different short stories, each starring its own protagonist and featuring distinct gameplay mechanics and presentations. While the battle system is turn-based strategy, sometimes the game flips that on its head in unique ways.
Last year, Square Enix resurrected the title by giving it an Octopath Traveler-style HD-2D facelift, a rearranged soundtrack, and full voice-acting. You can pre-order the game on PlayStation and Steam to get a 20% discount. To learn more, you can read our review of Live A Live here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A short animated sequence kicks The Last Worker into gear, reeling off the game’s backstory with breezy efficiency. It’s an apt start for this first-person satire set in a fully-automated dystopia, in that it underlines a very human aptitude for artistic communication. It’s surprising, then, that as The Last Worker continues its story, it takes less graceful turns, electing for verbosity over economy. For a game that takes critical aim at the future of work, frankly, it’s all a bit laboured.
So what does happen in that opening animation? First, we see everyman hero Kurt among thousands of recruits arriving at the gigantic distribution centre of megacorp Jüngle (like Amazon, get it?), to spend their working lives plucking products off shelves to order. Before long, though, any drop in output sees the employees themselves plucked off and given the boot, to be replaced by robots. As the numbers dwindle, top-performer Kurt remains steadfast, and even finds love among the boxes with a fellow product picker. But when she gets pregnant and quits, he stays behind, living full-time in the warehouse. Years pass. Jüngle smothers the entire retail market, and Kurt becomes, well, the last worker.

On paper, Crime Boss: Rockay City is bombastic, star-studded, and promises a city-spanning adventure about a criminal organization’s rise to the top. The actual game, however, is anything but. The gameplay is unbalanced, buggy, repetitive, and boring. The celebrity-filled cast is exciting at first glance, but crude and humorless writing weighs down the already-phoned-in performances of characters voiced by Michael Madsen, Michael Rooker, Vanilla Ice, and more. The single-player roguelite campaign lacks any of the genre’s typical hooks, and bu…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alt.Ctrl.GDC is a regular fixture at the Game Developers Conference, and this year I spotted some properly incredible creations from its largely student-led group of exhibitors. There was a big focus on co-op games and time trial demos in this year's cohort, with nearly every stand having some sort of whiteboard pinned up that was constantly being scrubbed out with new fastest lap times and corresponding visitor names. There was also lots of friendly hooting emanating from them as well, as mates and strangers attempted to co-ordinate their gaggles of limbs to steer various game characters in the right direction. 
It was excellent fun, and I sampled a bunch of games that used toasters, intricate pulley systems, papier-mache tree stumps, bike wheels and more in place of your typical controllers and mice and keyboard. There were also plenty more I didn't get to try out, mainly due to time, and you can see the full list over on GDC's website. For now, though, here are some personal highlights of what I saw, including the largest bowler hat I think I've ever seen in my life.

Not a fan of trapping said friends into small balls, only letting them out to fight gangs and other Godlike creatures? Well, Cassette Beasts might be the game for you. It's a Pokémon-like where you’ll still be beating up wildlife creatures in turn-based combat, but rather than capturing them, you record their likeness on the titular tapes and then transform into those same street cone-wearing crabs and metal-clad wolves. It looks like an energetic, nostalgic romp, and it’s coming to PC and Game Pass on April 26th.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Forspoken may not have set the world on fire, but those who enjoyed it have a new reason to revisit the world of Athia. Square Enix has announced a new story expansion called In Tanta We Trust, and it takes place decades before the campaign begins.
The story sees Frey Holland follow a mysterious voice that leads to her being sent back in time 25 years before she first stepped foot in Athia. She arrives at the Purge of Rheddig, the battle that caused Athia’s collapse and pushed the Tantas to madness. Frey must now fight to save this era of Athia, and she has backup in the form of Tanta Cinta. Frey gains new magical powers, including tag-team-focused abilities that utilize Tanta Cinta’s talents. The DLC also features new environments for players to scale using Frey’s parkour skills. 
Forspoken: In Tanta We Trust is a paid expansion that launches on May 26. Those who purchased the Digital Deluxe Edition of the game can play it three days early, on May 23. For more on Forspoken, you can read our review here. You can also check out this story on how Square Enix recently absorbed developer Luminous Productions.]]></summary>

It's been more than eight years since Tekken 7 arrived in arcades across the globe. While the console version didn't hit for another two years, the gap since that seventh entry represents the largest distance between two mainline entries since the series began in 1994. Bandai Namco used that time to evolve the experience, adding several new characters by way of DLC en route to the announcement of a highly anticipated eighth entry.
With so much time since Tekken 7 launched, Tekken 8 represents not only the franchise's first game developed for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, but als…]]></summary>

More specifically, Atlas Fallen will now hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on August 10. This news comes after previewers recently went hands-on with the game as part of a press event and after the game was showcased at PAX East, which took place last week. As for why Deck 13 is delaying Atlas Fallen, the team says it needs more time with the game.

Deck 13 also revealed that this delay will allow the team to include a full German voiceover for Atlas Fallen.

But less romantically, the title evokes Internet Explorer or Acrobat Reader - sitting comfortably alongside the clearly and sensibly labelled Windows software of the mid-90s. It’s a reminder of just how early Westwood happened upon the blueprint for real-time strategy, right as many PC users were buying their first trackball mice.

Back then, the developer was fresh from Dune II, its unlikely David Lynch adaptation and progenitor of the RTS genre as we know it today. Inspired by the house politics and struggle for resources that consumed the desert planet Arrakis, Westwood had come up with an addictive formula for harvesting spice and converting that wealth into military power, which in turn could be used in the battle to secure more spice. The team was, quite frankly, surprised by how much fun that formula had turned out to be.

In The Tartarus Key, a PS1-style thriller/puzzle/horror game, it's definitely the latter. The free demo is out now, and throws you into the first couple of puzzles for the game as Alex, whose last memory is of being at home in her apartment. Now she finds herself locked in a weird study in a poorly lit mansion, with only a stranger on the end of a walkie-talkie for company. It was enough to staple this game right into the middle of my disorganised Charlie Day conspiracy board of games I'm interested in, I'll tell you that much.

In IFPI's latest Global Music Report, insiders stress that music's 'human' element should stay at the forefront. According to Sony, the same applies to AI-synthesized voices, which should not replace human vocals.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Balsa Model Flight Simulator launched into Steam Early Access last year, to positive reviews and few sales. It is, like its developer's previous game Kerbal Space Program, about building a machine designed to fly, crashing it back to earth, then constructing something better. 

Now its developer has announced they're doing something similar with the game itself. Balsa Model Flight Sim will relaunch later this year with a new name, Kitbash Model Club, a more ambitious physics construction sandbox, and a plan to release as a complete game rather than into early access. Existing owners of Balsa Model Flight Simulator will get Kitbash Model Club for free.

Today's release of its first major update, titled Operation Sapphire Jackal, may help address that disparity given that it promises to fix "hundreds" of bugs in the base game. On the other hand, it also adds cosmetics - both those that can be unlocked for free and via spending real money.

That's an exceptional price for a brand new laptop that's still selling for £1100 at Amazon - Spring Sale or no.

It’s fully launching this summer, and Valve have been holding a limited access test since the pseudo-sequel's announcement. They’ve been inviting select players based on factors that are important to the dev team, such as trust factor, Steam account standing, and recent playtime on Valve servers. But last night, Valve shook their finger like a stern parent, informing fans that playing more Counter-Strike: Global Offensive wouldn’t get them into the CS2 test any faster.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new character trailer for Tekken 8 showcases the action of the returning Jun Kazama. Jin’s long-lost mother is making her first playable appearance in a mainline entry since Tekken 2, and based on a new gameplay trailer, she hasn’t lost a step.
A gameplay trailer shows off Jun’s expert use of Kazama-style martial arts to cleanse opponents of their evils. That translates to beating the snot out of them if that wasn’t obvious. We also see a brief reunion between Jun and her former lover, Kazuya, and it goes about as well as you would expect from a mother meeting the father and repeat attempted killer of their son. 


For those keeping count, here’s the list of confirmed fighters thus far:
Jack-8
Jin Kazama
Kazuya Mishima
King
Lars Alexandersson
Marshall Law
Nina Williams
Paul Phoenix
Tekken 8 still doesn’t have a release date, but it’s coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.]]></summary>

Had he not died in 1894, he might’ve said the same thing about the Logitech G502 Hero showing up in Amazon sales events, although maybe it wouldn’t have sounded as profound.


That’s right, the G502 Hero – beloved by RPS readers, a longtime resident in our best gaming mouse list, and precursor to an inferior new model – is once again going cheap. A predictable development, albeit an entirely welcome one. This time it’s in the Amazon Spring Sale, with a better-than-half-price discount bringing it down to £35.

"You know how police procedurals all have at least one episode that's about gamers, so they have to make up a game for it? This feels like that. It's like a fake game made up by a Hollywood television  producer."
A few hours later, after numerous short cutscenes in which Michael Rooker has to shout nonsensical American Football metaphors every so often, to justify the fact that his character is called Touchdown, and Michael Madsen growls about "candy" in a hard-living 65-year-old's voice coming out of an uncanny-vallyy 35-year-old's face, I text him an update: "It's also like that tweet that goes 'Bames Nond's having a stronk, call a bondulance'."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tax Heaven 3000 changed its release date a couple of times, moving from a March 31st date that was suspiciously close to April Fools' Day, to April 4th after its removal from Steam, to yesterday, March 27th. For the uninitiated, Tax Heaven 3000 is the anime dating sim that claims to do your taxes and asks you for identifying info such as your email and Social Security Number. It’s likely a joke app, partly because of its waifu Iris (like, the IRS) and partly because it’s from MSCHF, the art collective behind Lil Nas X’s Satan Shoes and other viral drops.

The Legend of Zelda series producer, Eiji Aonuma, revealed this during today's Tears of the Kingdom gameplay showcase. He then jumped directly into the game, showing off more than 10 minutes of new gameplay. Aonuma begins this demonstration by showing how Link can get up to the Sky Islands floating above Hyrule. He uses the "Recall" power, which rewinds an object's movement, to reverse a fallen rock's descent. He's able to reach one of the floating sky islands using this new power. 
After fighting an enemy up here, we learn that weapon durability, a hotly debated feature of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, is back. But now, you can use Link's new "Fuse" ability to create brand-new weapons. Aonuma showed us ho…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As is so often the case in systemic turn-based tactics games, things started to go wrong in my preview session for The Lamplighters League when a nearby torch met a cunningly placed oil slick and erupted into flames. A load of enemies were instantly enveloped in its hot sea of death, as intended, but one of our heroes - the tank-like bruiser Fedir - also ended up getting burned by mistake. As an ex-mob enforcer, he's certainly built to take a few punches, and his abilities are all focused on making him the centre of attention, his attacks growing more powerful as his rage levels continue to grow. "You want him to get attacked," game director Chris Rogers tells me, calling on the phrase 'you wouldn't like him when he's angry' as the basis for Fedir's ability set. But with that extra fire damage he receives, it's just a little too much all at once. He gets knocked down, and the tide of battle quickly goes south.
In truth, I played no part in this downfall. Rogers was in the control cockpit for this one, showing me exactly how Harebrained Schemes' latest game actually works. It's quite a different proposition from their last game, Battletech, and in this quite literal trial by fire, studio head and co-founder Mitch Gitelman actually pulled a dollar out of his pocket at one point and put a bet on whether Rogers would make it out alive. He certainly had his work cut out for him. Rogers won that dollar, and here's how the game's emphasis on deep, customisable character builds set him up for success.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[E3 2023 has taken another hit, as Ubisoft has confirmed it will not have a presence at the show. In a statement to Video Games Chronicle, the publisher reveals that it will instead hold its own live presentation on June 12 in Los Angeles. 
The publisher statement to VGC reads “While we initially intended to have an official E3 presence, we’ve made the subsequent decision to move in a different direction, and will be holding a Ubisoft Forward Live event on 12th June in Los Angeles. We look forward to sharing more details with our players very soon.”
Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot stated in February that the company would commit to attending “if E3 happens”. If that's the case, this news certainly doesn’t bode well for the fate of what’s supposed to be E3’s big return. 
As for what Ubisoft could show at its event, Assassin’s Creed Mirage, The Crew Motorfest, and (maybe) Skull and Bones are slated to release this year. Other announced projects include the long-quiet Splinter Cell and Prince of Persia remakes, a multitude of new Assassin’s Creed games, and Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora. A rumored follow-up to Immortals Fenyx Rising could also make an appearance.  
Ubisoft joins Nintendo on the list of major publishers that have declined to participate in this year’s show, following a previous report that Microsoft and Sony plan to follow suit. E3 is largely organized by ReedPop this year and will take place June 13-16 at the Los Angeles Convention Center. The event will open its doors to fans and press, with separate attendance days for each. It will be the first in-person event since 2019.

But while it was valuable to us, the Wii U struggled to sell and has ultimately gone down as one of Nintendo’s most disappointing consoles. Today, the system’s eShop shuts down forever, permanently closing a chapter of Nintendo’s history.

Think Octodad in a night club and you’d be on the right track (although the disastrous limb flailing is enough to keep me out of the clubs).
That lack of rhythm isn’t just native to the dance floor of an awkward family party, though. Even nuzzled into my chair with a controller in hand, I simply can’t stick to the beat. My eyes glued to notes floating across the screen, trying to hit them at just the right time, you’d probably see Time hiding in a corner to my left, giggling at my repeated failure. A barrage of borked bleeps and bungled notes tend to leave me with spirits sunk.
In Hi-Fi Rush, though, I always leave with my head held high.

And I can't exactly complain: the series' Rapture arc — made up of the first and second games, plus the prequel novel by none other than John "The Crow" Shirley — now makes up maybe 10% of my personality, having given me two of my favourite video games, my favourite video game tie-in book, and a front-running contender for my favourite video game locale all at once.
I just wish that, after all that prep I did for it, I'd actually liked BioShock Infinite a bit more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It has been said (by me) that a lot of games journalists are generalists in terms of what we play, especially if we're talking about people who are staffers at an outlet, or have ever worked in guides. Though we all have stuff we prefer, or series that we serve as the go-to expert on for in-house needs (I think vid bud Liam might actually walk around wearing an ASK ME ABOUT RESIDENT EVIL badge in his day-to-day life), we - unlike the blue-haired neo-Gods of streaming - often can't focus on one game all of the time. You have to know enough about enough to be able to write about enough.
There are, however, a bunch of big important games that I haven't played. Sometimes it's because a bunch of other people have, so that gap in the site's knowledge is already plugged (and I do always make sure to be aware of their impact and basic facts). Other times, they might be games that I'm not really interested in playing, either because they're not my genre or they seem too overwrought. Or, in some cases, it's because everyone says they're really good and I have to try them, though I've been burned before on this method (you people said the same about Ready Player One). But you know what would make me take in info about these games, even if it's just by osmosis? If they all got PowerWash Sim DLCs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Terra Nil is a puzzle-citybuilder about reclaiming the environment. You replace pollution with lush life across a series of four randomly generated dioramas (plus four slightly more complicated challenge levels), covering the landscape in fynbos and forests, lichen and lagoons. When it all comes together and you can look over the fruits of your labour, birds chirping and piano melodically playing in the background, it’s beautiful. Getting to that point, though, is an often repetitive experience marred with frustration.

Nintendo has announced that tomorrow at 7 a.m. PT/10 a.m. ET, they'll be releasing the first proper gameplay showcase of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. The presentation will be hosted by Zelda series producer Eiji Aonuma, and will last "roughly 10 minutes." Here's the announcement tweet:
Join The Legend of #Zelda series producer, Eiji Aonuma, for roughly 10 minutes of gameplay from The Legend of Zelda: #TearsOfTheKingdom on 3/28 at 7:00 a.m. PT on our YouTube channel.

To watch the video when it premieres tomorrow on YouTube, just click the Link below:
Despite the fact that we've gotten multiple trailers over the past few months, Nintendo has yet to reveal any clip of gameplay longer than a few seconds, and every new glimpse seems to raise more questions than it answers. What are those strange vehicles? Does Link have a new paraglider? And why does the game cost $70? Whether or not tomorrow's showcase addresses those questions, we'll all find out when Tears of the Kingdom releases on May 12.
We'll be live streaming our reactions to the 10 minutes showcase on Game Informer's Twitch channel.]]></summary>

Those developers - Table 9 Studio - are now back with their own not-modded game: an auto-battling, fantasy Chess roguelike called Tales & Tactics.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rod Humble has his son to thank for his upcoming life sim Life By You. After finishing up work on two successful mobile games around four years ago, Humble was itching for something new. But he wasn't quite sure what. "I was in the kitchen talking to my son about, 'Oh, what should I do? I don't know what opportunities there are,' and he was like, 'Why don't you just pick the company you want to work at and ask them?'" And as a life-long Crusader Kings player, the answer was clear. "Okay!?" Humble says incredulously. "I can do that, I guess. So I did. I wrote to [PR manager] Troy [Goodfellow], and he knew Fred [Wester, CEO], and that was it. It was two weeks later and I met him in San Francisco and said, hey, I'd like to start a studio, and here's the way I'd like to run it. And he was like, sure, let's go for it."
So began Humble's journey to creating Life By You, his upcoming life simulator that's set to give his former pet project, The Sims, a run for its money. With The Sims 5, or Project Rene as it's currently known, still some way off, Life By You seems poised to finally give life sim fans the game they've always wanted. "I wanted to make an open world life simulator where the core tenant was freedom," says Humble. "Where players could freely play and tell their stories with minimal friction." And what was standing in the way of that freedom? Loading screens, says Humble.

The Great War Colon Western Front is about taking the Triple Alliance or Entente through the hell years of 1914-18, or beyond. It's a purely military game about overcoming massed defences through attrition, both in localised real-time battles, and a turn-based strategic map. It's perhaps unfair to criticise it for repetition and some intermittent sense of futility, since a First World War game without them would defeat the point. But I still feel a little mixed.

It wasn't due to launch in full until sometime this winter, but that window's now up in the air after Dark And Darker was removed from Steam over the weekend, following a messy legal dispute between Nexon and developers Ironmace, who have been accused of “using trade secrets and copyrighted information,” allegedly stolen from Nexon.

The files state that the “severity” is “high”, the “version” is “2”, but what about the “priority?” Bad news for fans of the run-and-gunning zombie shooter: according to the files, the priority is “none.”

We then had a chance to go hands on with the PAX East demo, and wow, we were both incredibly impressed. Watch the video below for our enthusiastic impressions:
If we could give an RPS 'Bestest Best in show' award to a game, is would be Animal Well. Liam and I loved the game's dense atmosphere, spider-web of interconnected caverns, and creepy creatures that lurk in the dark. We also loves the effects the game has, which reminded Liam of Octopath Traveler's visual flairs. If I had to compare it to one game, it would be Hollow Knight, which is very exciting.
We have plenty more PAX East indies for you to check out so make sure you have a peruse through our RPS@PAX tag. A couple of our favourites have been chaotic rouguelite Pizza Possum, Resident Evil-like Alone In The Dark, and island exploration game Mythwrecked.

Liam and I have now both played the demo and you can listen to our impressions in the video below:
What really appealed to us about Pizza Possum is how chaotic it is. It's like Untitled Goose Game but at double the speed. Playing the eponymous possum, you need you scamper around a sunny Mediterranean town scoffing as much food as you can get your grubby mitts on.
There's an element of hide-and-seek too, as there are patrol dogs who will try and stop your food eating rampage, but you can quickly jump into a berry bush to thorw them off your scent. It's goofy fun, and we're completeley smitten with it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Liam and I had a fun time chatting with the folks over at Mega Cat Studios about their upcoming wrestling RPG WrestleQuest last year at PAX West, and this time at PAX East we finally cornered them in the ring for a proper interview.
Watch below to learn about how the developers created their zero to hero story, how they're addressing myths and persaonl issues in the world of pro wresting, as well as sharing a story about how one of the team got their nose broken in a wrestling accident during development.
My main take away from the interview is how much of the RPG incorporates all aspects of Wrestling, not just the ring fights we see on TV. Another interesting thing is that Mega Cat reached out to a handful of real-life wrestlers to ask their permission to use their likeness in the game - not an easy feat to secure, I'm sure.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've played a bunch of indie game demos at PAX East, but none left my head reeling as much as 43 Studios' fiendishly frantic action platfotmer Hell Of An Office. It's a super fast parkour adventure in the vein of Neon White, and after ten minutes with the demo my heart race was through the roof. If I owned a fitbit it would have been screaming at me to have a nice sit down with a cuppa. Check out my full impressions in the video below:
Hell Of An Office puts your platforming reflexes to the test as you're tasked with sprinting ad jumping your way straight outta hell. With only a stapler as your means of survival, you need to navigate through each level before it slowly sinks into the burning lava. React quickly, or fall victim to Hell's scorching pools.
If you love the blood-pumping, sweaty palm inducing action-platforming of Neon White, make sure to keep an eye on Hell Of An Office as it makes it's way through Early Access.

One of the things it has in common with those games is that it was released in early access. After a little more than a year, version 1.0 arrived this week, bringing a final area, a new boss, and the end of its storyline.

It differs in several key ways too, thankfully, from its more urban setting, its tactile power tools, and the ability to automate a lot of the gathering and crafting by putting residents to work for you.

        <updated>2023-03-25T18:51:22.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I really enjoyed dark fantasy adventure Roki when it first released back in 2020, and keen to see what developers Polygon Treehouse have gotten up to since, I jumped at the opportunity to play the PAX East demo for Mythwrecked: Ambrosia Island. You can watch my impressions of the demo in the video below:
In Mythwrecked you play as Alex, a backpacker who has washed up on the sun-drenched shores of Ambrosia Island. As she begins exploring, she soon realises that this island seems to be a hot spot for the gods from ancient Greek myths. Your task is to befriend each god, help them restore their memories, and find a way back to civilisation.
From playing the demo, you can see much of what made Roki fun reflected in Mythwrecked. The environments are interesting to poke around in, puzzles are breezy brain ticklers, and it has Polygon Treehouse's sense of humour. Each Greek god has a humerous twist on their lore,  and during the demo I had a fun time chatting with Hermes, who is dressed in nothing more than a pair of skimpy white speedos and a matching white sweat band - a bold choice of attire.

To know that a game heavily inspired by Chrono Trigger will feature music from the man behind its score is exciting. Still, it is worth being excited for the soundtrack that Mitsuda will not be directly involved with, as well.
The majority of Sea of Stars’ soundtrack is in the hands of the talented Eric W. Brown, who also composed the soundtrack for The Messenger. Brown’s musical history started with playing drums in metal bands. “I've been a drummer since I was a kid and I'm still a drummer now, but, you know, I got into music production via chiptune essentially,” Brown says.  Around 2006 he decided to focus on making music on his own in the chiptune genre, primarily on Game…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A video game based on the hit Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles graphic novel The Last Ronin is in the works, Polygon reports.
The news comes from Polygon's interview with Doug Rosen, senior vice president for games and emerging media at Paramount Global. According to Rosen, The Last Ronin video game will be a single-player action role-playing title in the vein of the Norse-themed God of War series. Like the story it adapts, the game will feature a mature tone. The game’s developer has not been named, and the project is years away from release. 
The Last Ronin was published in 2020 as a five-issue mini-series by IDW. It takes place in a dark futuristic New York, where three of the four turtles have been killed. The surviving turtle, whose identity is revealed at the end of the first issue (we won’t spoil it), dons a black mask and seeks revenge by fighting crime using both his and the weapons of his fallen brothers. 
It’s a cool (and very grim) story if you haven’t read it, and we’re excited to see it translated into a game. Rosen also mentions in the same interview that Paramount sees opportunities to create different types of TMNT games that target young and adult audiences. 
The Turtles are enjoying quite the renaissance lately thanks to the launch of the well-received beat ‘em up Shredder’s Revenge last year, the nostalgia trip of the Cowabunga Collection, a Shredder-themed Call of Duty pack, and even a new animated film coming to theaters this August.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Daedalic Entertainment revealed The Lord of the Rings: Gollum way back in 2019, announcing that it would be released in 2021. In 2021, however, it was delayed to 2022. In May of last year, Daedalic revealed Gollum would release in September but then, in July, announced it had been delayed once more. Now, today, Daedalic has revealed that Gollum will finally be released this May. 
More specifically, Gollum will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on May 25. There will be a Switch version of the game, but Daedalic says it's planned for later this year. Alongside today's news, Daedalic has released a new story trailer. Check it out below: 


"The Lord of the Rings: Gollum is a story-driven action adventure," a press release reads. "Embark on a perilous journey as Gollum, chasing the only thing that is precious to you. Climb, leap, and sneak your way past dangers or into advantageous spots. Gollum is skillful and sly, and torn by a split personality. It is up to you to decide whether to yield to the darker side of Gollum or trust the kinder gentler hint of Sméagol." 
Check out some new screenshots from the game below: 

For more about The Lord of the Rings: Gollum, check out this trailer highlighting the game's supporting cast and then check out this trailer featuring some of the game's stealth-based gameplay. Watch this trailer showing off the game's parkour gameplay after that.

Its specialty is developing immersive sims, a niche it’s helped cultivate since 1999. On May 2, Arkane releases its next project, Redfall, an open-world first-person shooter.
I’ve been a fan of Arkane Studios’ rich single-player worlds for years. Naturally, I had questions about Redfall’s position in the developer’s portfolio. However, after interviewing Studio Head Harvey Smith and playing the game for 90 minutes, I have the answers I was looking for – and I’m excited to share it all in this week’s episode of The Game Informer Show.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last year, Sonic Origins celebrated Sonic the Hedgehog's birthday by gathering Sonic the Hedgehog, Sonic the Hedgehog 2, Sonic 3 & Knuckles, and Sonic CD in one place with new features and some added bonuses. Despite some shortcomings, the compilation remains the best official way to experience those classic games from Genesis and Sega CD three decades following their original releases. Today, Sega announced the bundle is about to get better through Sonic Origins Plus, a premium upgrade that arrives a year after the collection's initial launch.
Sonic Origins Plus brings forward all the features of Sonic Origins delivered last year – Classic Mode, Anniversary Mode, widescreen support, added story animations, a virtual museum, and more – while adding a bunch of new content. First up, Sonic Origins Plus adds all 12 Sonic Game Gear games to the museum.
The full list of Game Gear games getting added is listed below.
Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine
Sonic Blast
Sonic Chaos
Sonic Drift
Sonic Drift 2
Sonic Labyrinth
Sonic Spinball
Sonic the Hedgehog
Sonic the Hedgehog 2
Sonic the Hedgehog Triple Trouble
Tails Adventure
Tails' Sky Patrol
On top of that, Amy joins the roster of playable characters in the Genesis and Sega CD titles (Sonic 1, Sonic 2, Sonic 3 & Knuckles, and Sonic CD). One of the strangest exclusions in the original Sonic Origins release is also rectified, as Knuckles will become playable in Sonic CD. Sadly, this first press release does not make any mention of restoring the replaced music in Sonic the Hedgehog 3.


Sonic Origins Plus arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on June 23. If you don't already own the initial release of Sonic Origins, the digital version of Sonic Origins Plus costs $40. The physical version, which includes a 20-page artbook and reversible coversheet with new art, also costs $40. If you already own Sonic Origins, you can upgrade to Plus for $10. For more on Sonic Origins, check out our review from the base compilation here.]]></summary>

These five songs will join the recently-added six songs from The World Ends With You series. That DLC pack added "Someday," "Your Ocean," "World is Yours," "Breaking Free," "Twister," and "Calling."

The real-time tactical shooter pits a squad of marines against dozens of deadly xenomorphs, though we hadn't seen any gameplay footage until the release of a new video today.
A gameplay commentary video walks players through the basics, in which players command a team of marines to investigate a xenomorph outbreak on Moon Lethe. You’ll issue commands for teammates to attack or execute skills and can also slow time during firefights to select orders. However, your squadmates can perish permanently, but you can raise your survival odds by outfitting soldiers with various weapons and upgrades to ensure the best team composition.


Aliens: Dark Descent is being devleoped by Tindalos Interactive, makers of the Battlefleet Gothic: Armada series, and will be published by Focus Entertainment. It arrives on June 20 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Atari has announced that it has entered into an agreement to acquire Night Dive Studios, the team behind the upcoming remake of System Shock, for roughly $10 million. 
Night Dive Studios is currently led by Stephen Kick and Larry Kuperman and is both a development studio and a publisher. It has published more than 100 games, and will add its remake of System Shock to that list on May 30 (on PC). Atari says a key to the success of Night Dive Studios is its proprietary KEX engine that makes classic games playable on modern hardware. Considering Atari is a retro company, and one that just acquired 12 classic retro games, it's easy to see what Night Dive Studios can do for it.

        <updated>2023-03-23T12:14:19.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Arkane was developing a PlayStation 5 version of its upcoming first-person vampire shooter, Redfall, before Microsoft acquired Bethesda in 2020. However, following the acquisition, the PS5 version of the game was canceled by Microsoft, according to Arkane director Harvey Smith in an interview with IGN France (translated by IGN). 
Discussing this with IGN France, Smith said, "We got bought by Microsoft and that was a huge sea change. They said, 'No PlayStation 5. Now we're gonna do Game Pass, Xbox and PC.'"


Smith said Arkane didn't mind the decision, even if Redfall was originally meant to release on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC. 
"Support from Game Pass and having to worry about one less platform, one less complexity," Smith told IGN France. "And Game Pass has a ton of people that can play. It could be our biggest game ever because of the 30 million Game Pass [members] or whatever that number is." 
News of this canceled PS5 version of Redfall doesn't come as much of a surprise. When Redfall was revealed during a 2021 Xbox and Bethesda E3 showcase, it was revealed as an Xbox console exclusive. And considering it's par for the course for companies like PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo to keep their first-party releases off of competitor consoles, it's also not surprising Microsoft opted to make Redfall an Xbox exclusive after it acquired Bethesda. 
A spokesperson for Microsoft responded to this story, providing the following statement: 
Redfall hits Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC on May 2. 
For more about the game, watch the latest Redfall story trailer that introduces some of the vampiric big bass and then watch this gameplay trailer that invites you out to a bloody night on the town.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Publisher CI Games and developer Hexworks have released a new trailer showcasing some of the impressive visual work going into its upcoming Lords of the Fallen sequel, The Lords of the Fallen. 
The Lords of the Fallen, previously known as Lords of the Fallen 2, has had a rocky development history thus far, but with Hexworks taking over development back in 2020, the sequel has begun to shape up.
We got a reveal trailer during Gamescom last year that showcased the game's darker, more gothic tone alongside word that this sequel will feature online co-op and a world five times larger than its predecessor. We got another look at the game's grisly world in a new trailer released during The Game Awards back in December, and now, thanks to Epic's State of Unreal presentation today, we get to see more of the game. 
Because it's a trailer released as part of today's State of Unreal presentation, it's less cinematic than previous trailers and instead, focuses on some of the visual design work going into the game.
Check it out for yourself below in this new trailer for The Lords of the Fallen:  


As you can see, The Lords of the Fallen continues to look great, and fortunately, we don't have to wait too much longer to go hands-on with it because it's due out on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC sometime this year. 
For more information about the game, head to our hub for The Lords of the Fallen and then read our thoughts on its predecessor in Game Informer's Lords of the Fallen review after that.

Since 2019, the Xbox-owned developer has released two instances of behind-the-scenes footage, with one revealing the game is not a direct sequel to 2017's Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice. We did get some gameplay during a trailer at The Game Awards in 2021 but since then, not much. 
Now, thanks to today's State of Unreal presentation highlighting the current state of Epic's Unreal Engine, we get another tease of what's to come in Senua's Saga: Hellblade II; this time, it's a look at the impressive facial animation Ninja Theory has pulled off in the sequel.

Counter-Strike 2 will run in the Source 2 engine, which has tools and rendering features "available for community map makers to make it easier to build, experiment, and iterate." There will be a Source 2 Item Workshop as well, and it will be available at a later time during the Counter-Strike 2 limited test.

Upgraded and overhauled maps
Game-changing dynamic smoke grenades

News on Marvel's Spider-Man 2, the highly anticipated follow-up to Insomniac Games' Marvel's Spider-Man from 2018 and 2020's Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales, has been light since the game's reveal in 2021.

        <updated>2023-03-21T17:08:37.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few months ago, Netflix announced it was partnering with Gears of War developer The Coalition to bring a film and TV project to the streaming service. Today, the company announced the writer on the film project will be John Spaihts, known most recently for his work on Dune and Doctor Strange. In a press release, Spaihts had the following to say about the project:
 In the same press release, The Coalition called Spaihts "a master storyteller." The Gears of War developer will also be attached to this project as a producer. You can see their tweet about the announcement below.
🫡
@jonspaihts - a talented writer and fellow Gears fan - to adapt an authentic live action Gears of War film with @netflix. https://t.co/OQ3HtpiJkB
March 21, 2023
We still have no release window for the project, and given that they've only just attached a writer, it's probably still a few years out. While many are likely excited at the prospect of this movie's existence, there is perhaps nobody more eager to be in on the production details than Dave Bautista. The Guardians of the Galaxy star has been campaigning for years to be cast as the live-action version of Marcus Fenix, and was even available as a playable skin in a post-launch update to Gears 5.
Who do you think should direct or star in the Gears movie? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-03-21T13:37:16.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Activision has revealed that Crash Team Rumble, the 4v4 competitive multiplayer game revealed at The Game Awards last year, will be released this June. 
More specifically, Crash Team Rumble hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One on June 20, as reported by Video Games Chronicle. Activision has also revealed that a closed beta will take place from April 20 through April 24 and anyone who preorders the game will get access to it. This beta will feature Crash Bandicoot, Coco Bandicoot, Tawna Bandicoot, Doctor Neo Cortex, and Dingodile. 


The game will cost $29.99 but a deluxe edition for $39.99 will also be available. Crash Team Rumble will also include a battle pass and both editions include the first season's pass. The deluxe edition will also include the Season 2 battle pass, a free 25-tier boost for Season 1, and the digital proto pack, which brings "Blocky" skins to the game alongside some equippable items, according to VGC. 
Previews released today mention three different roles in Crash Team Rumble: Booster, Blocker, and Scorer. Using these three roles in a MOBA-like fashion, players will need to collect as much Wumpa Fruit as possible and bring it to their zone. If you've played 2021's Pokemon Unite, you probably get the gist here. 

Crash Team Rumble will feature crossplay. It is being developed by Toys for Bob, the team that developed the Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy collection and Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time. 
While waiting for Crash Team Rumble to release in June, read Game Informer's Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy review and then read our review of Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time. 
Crash Team Rumble hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One on June 20.

The trailer provides glimpses of Cal’s friends and crewmates Ceres Junda, Greez Dritus, and Merrin, all sporting five years' worth of age, strife, and hair (or lack thereoff). We also get a look at a new partner, the mercenary Bode Akuna. Some fresh gameplay clips are sprinkled in, too, as we see the now grizzled Cal duel stormstroopers, bounty hunters, and droids. 


Star Wars Jedi: Survivor launches on April 28 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. To learn more, check out this story about how the director hopes to turn the series into a trilogy and our interview with star Cameron Monaghan.]]></summary>
