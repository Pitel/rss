In God Of War Ragnarok, the action kicks off a during the apocalyptic fimbulwinter, which is probably bad for some characters I don’t care about, but it is good for me personally, because there’s a lot of snow to play with.
How much snow, you ask? 190 flippin’ gigs worth, apparently, according to Sony’s system requirements.

A merry old time was had, romping through fortress cities like a small herd of crusader buffalo, using the game's absurd jetpack functionality to pancake invading Tyranids, and getting our screens so slathered in gore we couldn't work out who was killing what.
It looks like the gargantuan action game's PvP multiplayer will be even messier. Saber and Focus Home have released an extended trailer that walks you through two major modes - the PvE boss and wave-slaying frenzy of Operations, and the 12-player PvP carnage of Eternal War, which spans a range of match types. The ecstasy of dying for the Emperor aside, both give me frightful flashbacks to the early days of Gears Of War.

How to defeat Cliff in Pokémon GO 


Cliff is essentially a slab of muscle, and so are his Pokémon with their high defense. But don’t think you won’t need a strategy to bring him down.

Changing mediums is always a risk, but it turns out that some video game novels are actually pretty spectacular in and of themselves.

Trivial missions are often straightforward, teaching you the basics and pitting you against only small groups of foes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Every day is a holiday if you have the right calendar, and August 8 is International Cat Day. That served up the perfect opportunity for Annapurna Interactive to announce a November 19, 2024 release date for the Nintendo Switch version of Stray.


The BlueTwelve Studio-developed adventure first launched on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and PC via Steam on July 19, 2022, with Xbox One and Xbox Series versions following in August. Now it's almost Nintendo's turn, and you can see a purrfect snapshot of what the game has to offer on Switch below.




For those who haven't checked it out yet, Stray makes for a unique little sci-fi journey, putting you in control of a brave little cat. With the help of a flying drone called B12, you're tasked with escaping a neon-tinged cybercity full of threats and on the verge of decay. 


Stray has picked up positive reviews and accolades since launch, including awards for Best Independent Game and Best Debut Indie Game at the 2022 Game Awards. While it didn't win, it was also up for Game of the Year at the same event. It was nominated for multiple BAFTA awards in 2023, as well, and took home a pair of wins at the 2023 NAVGTR (National Academy of Video Game Trade Reviewers) Awards. 


We got our first look at the Switch version of Stray during the June 2024 Nintendo Direct. As far as ports go, other than being on a less powerful platform it doesn't seem as if there are any additional bells and whistles of note. On the other hand, much like those who have it on their Steam Deck, you'll now be able to explore the dystopian adventure on the go. That's precisely how a cat would prefer to play.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are a lot of items in Fields of Mistria which seem to serve no purpose outside of gifts, but that doesn’t mean these items should be ignored. If you’re wanting to befriend or even woo a villager, it’s a good idea to stock up on their loved gifts. 


One of these items is the Shadow Flower. It’s not immediately obvious where this can be found, but it’s easy to find when you know where to look and if you’ve got luck on your side.


Warning: This article contains spoilers for events which occur after progressing a fair way through the Mines (below level 19), so if you’re trying to avoid these, I’d suggest not reading what Shadow Flowers are used for. 


How to find a Shadow Flower in Fields of Mistria

To find a Shadow Flower in Fields of Mistria, you’ll need to go diving into the Mines. Specifically, you’ll need to work through the first 20 floors, as it doesn’t seem to spawn in any of the lower floors, although this is yet to be verified as I continue working my way down. 


Shadow Flowers are purple in color and can spawn in any part of the Mines where there aren’t any rocks or other items. You may not come across them very often (this is where the luck I mentioned comes in), but you should make sure to pick them up and store them away when you find them.

While diving through the Mines, you’ll encounter a new character — the Priestess. You’ll only meet her on floors 20, 40, 60 and so on, but she becomes a pretty big part of the story as you progress through the Mines. 


Eventually, you’ll be able to give her gifts and Shadow Flowers are among the easiest items that she loves receiving as a gift.

It brought fast-paced action, comedy, and intrigue as players navigate Pandora and all of its dangers in pursuit of sweet, sweet loot. In time, Borderlands became the starting point for an entire gaming franchise, of numerous beloved and not-so-beloved games,


Now, at long last, the long-running series has made the jump to live-action, following in the footsteps of other recent video game adaptations such as Twisted Metal, The Last of Us, and Fallout, to name a few. Early critic impressions of the Borderlands movie are in, and well, they're not very positive.

Yet he is mediocre when it comes to damaging output and has a very slow reload speed. His super allows him to summon a swarm of bats that can help him heal himself as well as inflict damage on his enemies.


However, just like any brawler, he also needs several buffs in the form of gadgets, gear, and star power. To help you with that, here is a comprehensive build guide for Mortis in Brawl Stars.

With the pack covering all aspects of social interactions, there were bound to be a few mishaps with expansions and game packs clashing, which the last few updates looked to resolve. 


The latest set of The Sims 4 patch notes, released on August 8 by Maxis and Electronic Arts, continues this trend as it adds romance for ghosts and vampires, multiple changes to Cupid's Corner, and various quality-of-life fixes.


The Sims 4 August 8 update patch notes and changes


The Sims 4's August 8 update primarily focuses on base game and Lovestruck expansion fixes, particularly with what Sims appear in the Cupid's Corner dating app and a few changes to various passionate interactions. Alongside these, the base game experienced multiple changes, both relating to and outside romance. 


Let's take a look at a quick highlight summary for this update:



Gallery Sims are available again in Cupid's Corner, allowing you to date custom characters again.


Ghosts and Vampires can now go to Cupid's Counseling and perform seductive dances.


"Cuddle in Bed" no longer puts your Sims in a peculiar T-pose.


You can pay house and power bills for your Sims' homes again.


Ciudad Enamorada changes, including better camera movement, Casita del Amor's lot appearing correctly in the Gallery, and miscellaneous building changes.


Fixes to error codes 121 and 123.



Alongside these major changes, you'll also encounter small bug fixes in packs like Seasons, High School Years, and Growing Together, alongside game packs like Realm of Magic, My Wedding Stories, and Dine Out. You'll be able to find this update immediately starting today after downloading The Sims 4's patch for it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We’re well past the one-year mark in Diablo 4, so we have gone through many seasons. From launch to now, we are in the fifth season and quickly approaching the sixth. So, looking back, what are all the season start and end dates for Diablo 4?


All Diablo 4 season start and end dates so far


As of this article, we are on Season Five, Season of the Infernal Hordes, which will be uncharacteristically shorter than most seasons so far, but for good reason. In any case, here are all the previous seasons and how long they have lasted.



Season 1 - Season of the Malignant (July 20, 2023 - October 17, 2023) 89 days


Season 2 - Season of Blood (October 17, 2023 - January 23, 2024) 98 days


Season 3 - Season of the Construct (January 23, 2024 - May 14, 2024) 112 days


Season 4 - Loot Reborn (May 14, 2024 - August 6, 2024) 84 days


Season 5 - Season of the Infernal Hordes (August 6, 2024 - October 8, 2024) 63 days


Season 6 - Vessel of Hatred (October 8, 2024 - TBD)

While some seasons have lasted a lot longer than others, the average time of a season in Diablo 4 is around three months. Each season also typically starts around 10 AM PST / 1 PM EST on the day of.


With each season also comes a new type of mechanic that fits the theme. For example, the Season of the Construct brought the Seneschal companion that had its own set of abilities to acquire and upgrade. There were also specific dungeons that went with it.


What we can expect in the future beyond Season 6 is yet to be known, but what we do know is that there will be new cosmetics like mounts, armor sets, and portals. We’ll also probably see new limited-time mechanics or Aspects that change up the meta for the run of the season.

Bare Butt Boxing from publisher and developer Tuatara Games makes a good first impression with its quirky character avatars, colorful maps, and cheeky premise. Though the title delivers knockabout fun and floaty arena combat chaos, the overall experience is a rather shallow one and not exactly the ‘Punch-Out!! With Your Arse Out’ concept we were primed for.
Players choose from one of six alien fighters to control and pummel each other across a variety of maps. You’ll find no traditional boxing rings here, but rather some uniquely designed environments containing portals that swallow anybody knocked into them as well as holes and gaps that send you hurling off the stage only to respawn a moment later.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You're a long time undead. 7 Days To Die was shuffling along in early access for 11 years, until version 1.0 finally burst through the windows. In that time, many other survival games have sprouted, blossomed, and gently faded away. I first visited the burnt-out ruins of this zombie-infested world a decade ago and I returned to it this week to find a tree-puncher that, despite bearing the pockmarks of early access, retains much of what made it enjoyable back when the survival genre was still wearing its baby onesie. Instead of a review, I figured I'd scribble together a mini starter guide for new (or returning) players. Partly because the game is a proper time sink and it was taking me so long to get through everything. But mostly because I wanted to use that numberful headline. So, here you go: 7 dos and 7 don'ts in 7 Days To (7) Die.

Still, it also retains a lot of familiar gameplay mechanics and concepts that ensure if you played the previous games, you’ll feel right at home. Whether…

Rainbow Arts' Rendering Ranger: R² is one of the rarest Super Famicom games in existence, but thanks to a partnership between Ziggurat Interactive and Limited Run Games, it's now heading to the Switch and will launch this Winter.
Although initially announced back in 2022, Ziggurat and Limited Run have been fairly quiet on the release since then, but fans can finally get their hands on either a digital version or physical edition later this year, bringing a swift end to the title's long-running scarcity. Originally released in Japan in 1995, only 10,000 copies were made and it quickly became one of the most sought-after console games of all time.

Khaligrad is plenty scrappy. Its edges are rough and you have to figure it out yourself, but it's more intuitive than it appears, and easy to operate once you discern some basics. It's scrappy too in that it's, well. It's Stalingrad. Not really: its world is so fictional it's their 15th century. But the invaders are explicitly fascists and the defenders communists embroiled in a long and brutal semi-guerrilla city war with World War 2 technology. Thankfully, it's stripped of any actual fashy or genocidal play-acting beyond each side doing "hail the empire/union" bits as a sign off.
I think that's why, despite its brutal and difficult setting, it's this year's entry in the long tradition of Low-Intensity Strategy Games For When Hot Why Hot Please Stop You Cannot See My Begging Tears For They Evaporate.

Switch eShop - Highlights
SteamWorld Heist II (Thunderful, 8th Aug, $29.99) - Get ready for an epic adventure on the high seas in this sequel to the critically-acclaimed SteamWorld Heist game! All is not well on the waves of the Great Sea – the waters are turning corrosive and eating away at the metal bodies of its robotic denizens. As the captain of a rag-tag crew of Steambots, you’ll lead the way through intense turn-based gunfights, where bullets can ricochet with deadly precision. This time around, there’s a world-map to explore, but be careful – there are no turns to take on the Great Sea, so you’ll have to engage in real-time naval combat against enemy vessels. Also new for this sequel is a job system with in-depth character customization options. With more than 150 weapons, utility items and ship equipment pieces, you can strategically craft your crew to best fit the mission at hand.

Console releases are planned, but unspecified; however, given that CrossCode eventually hit all platforms, including Switch, we're pretty hopeful we'll be playing this on the Switch successor.

The new game - currently untitled and without a release date - is a first-person sci-fi RPG set in an alternate-1900s North America, which ostensibly combines the ingenuity and gadgetry of Dishonored and Prey with a "real RPG" experience redolent of Skyrim and modern-day Fallout.

For those unfamiliar, Jaleco was a prominent force in the days of the Famicom, putting out dozens of console and arcade titles as far back as 1982. It would eventually go on to file bankruptcy in 2014 and its assets subsequently transfered over to City Connection. And now here we are!

The new Type-8 Transporter is a medium freighter capable of hauling a maximum of 406 tons of cargo. It's got a default jump range of 17.55 light years and two big prongs sticking out of its face like a sci-fi forklift. Cool. The catch is that this ship can only be bought with real money for now, say the developers. This is part of Frontier's new strategy of having paid-for ships in the game. I don't really play Elite Dangerous anymore, so I don't have strong feelings about that. But I do have strong feelings about the space trucker advertisement the developer has put together for the new ship. Come watch it with me.

We had high hopes for Trinity Fusion after playing it at PAX East two years ago, and we’re happy to say, it doesn’t disappoint. The concept is great. A human-made multiverse — made up of Prime, the Overworld, the Underworld, and the Hyperworld — is collapsing, and the only way to fix it is to merge all of the different worlds back together.
You play as three different versions, called counterselves, of a woman named Maya: Altara, Kera, and Naira. Each comes from a different world and has different abilities. Altara has access to unique ranged weapons thanks to her prosthetic arm and a double jump. Naira can wall jump. And Kera can launch enemies into the air and perform air combos. Everything’s better with air combos.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Be super duper quick.
A little while back, Retro Game Books offered up an unofficial Metroid pixel art eBook for absolutely nothing. The deal was valid for an exceptionally limited time, so if you happened to miss out, then you're in luck. As announced by creator Brian Riggsbee on social media, the Pixel Art Metroid eBook is free once again.
You'll need to be pretty quick, though, as the offer, which is to coincide with the 38th anniversary of the original NES title, is only applicable until 9th August at 11:59pm PT (so that's 10th August at 07:59am BST for those in the UK).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’d initially assumed that puzzle game Sliding Hero counts was a Sokoban-like, until I realised that it’s actually you, not endless boxes, that do the sliding here. Still, I wasn’t entirely convinced. The only thing that’s fun to slide back-and-forth indefinitely is a lounging cat on a smooth kitchen worktop. Still, after messing around with Sliding Hero’s Steam demo, I think this one might have much longer legs than its restrictive-sounding concept suggests. All the better to endlessly slide with.

Last month, we reported on the rather sad news that Mushihimesama, the wonderful bullet-hell shmup from developer Cave, would soon be delisted from the Switch eShop.
Well folks, there isn't much time left. Mushihimesama will disappear from the digital storefront later this week on 10th August 2024. If you're on the fence about whether to pick it up before it vanishes into the ether, then perhaps a cool 50% discount will push you over the edge.

If you picked option B you should probably play My Lovely Empress, a plush empire management sim with a dastardly twist, from Indonesian team GameChanger Studio. Find a trailer below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It is I, the wound salter. The injury insult adder. Life By You, the simulation life-em-up from Paradox, was canceled in June after being delayed indefinitely. The day after the cancellation - which Paradox CEO Fredrik Wester implied was down to a “lacking”, unfixable development state - designer Willem Delventhal spoke about his time at the subsequently shuttered Paradox Tectonic. He claimed the team spent a month “in purgatory” prior to being told of the game’s cancelation and studio shuttering two weeks before launch, despite being told by higher-ups that work was “exceeding expectations.”
We’ve now got another look at a game we’ll likely never get, thanks to a thread by Twxbbly user SimMattically collating unseen screenshots from portfolios by several artists who worked on Life By You.

The live-action Borderlands movie arrives in cinemas this week and the first impressions are now being shared online. We've rounded up some of these posts to see how it's being received so far.
Admittedly, it doesn't seem to be going down very well, with some suggesting it could be the "worst movie" of 2024, but there are some more positive reactions floating about. This new adventure features an all-star cast made up of Cate Blanchett, Jamie Lee Curtis, Kevin Hart, and Jack Black as Claptrap.

The AMD Ryzen 9000 series starting with the Ryzen 5 9600X and Ryzen 7 9700X launching tomorrow are some truly great desktop processors. The generational uplift is very compelling, even in single-threaded Linux workloads shooting ahead of Intel's 14th Gen Core competition, across nearly 400 benchmarks these new Zen 5 desktop CPUs impress, and these new Zen 5 desktop processors are priced competitively. I was already loving the Ryzen 7000 series performance on Linux with its AVX-512 implementation and performing so well across hundreds of different Linux workloads but now with the AMD Ryzen 9000 series, AMD is hitting it out of the ball park. That paired with the issues Intel is currently experiencing for the Intel Core 13th/14th Gen CPUs and the ~400 benchmark results makes this a home run for AMD on the desktop side with only some minor Linux caveats.]]></summary>

This is not the murmuring of some poor sod on a nineteen-hour Dota 2 binge who’s started thinking that the crumbs in his keyboard resemble a viable snack, but a bold new reality, one I recently found myself staring down during a trip to Asda. The supermarket chain – third biggest in the UK by turnover and purveyors of ill-fitting clothes and surprisingly good doughnuts alike – has added light-up gaming mice, keyboards, and headsets to its mountain of own-brand wares.
Asda being what it is (Americans, if you’re unfamiliar, think Walmart with less gun violence), it’s all dirt cheap as well. £17 for a full-size keyboard. £16 for an FPS mouse. Overwhelmed with curiosity, I ended up taking home a complete starter set (keeb, different mouse, headset, and mousemat) for £45, or about a third of the price of the Logitech G515 Lightspeed TKL that I’d shortly kick off my desk. Could this be a new frontier in affordable PC hardware, bringing tech to the masses in a way no specialist retailer ever could, or should supermarkets stick to cereal and meal deals? Surely the Asda Tech (real name) 4-in-1 Gaming Kit would have the answers.

As of the game’s latest hotfix blog, we’ve now got a better idea when we’ll start seeing some of these “smaller bits and pieces.” Bits and pieces? In this economy? Yes, and this month in fact. “Late August” to be precise by quoting a vague statement precisely.

We had Deviator last week - now, it's time for a bumper helping of the heebie-jeebies in the shape of Perennial Order. The title makes it sound like an eBay delivery of potted geraniums. The game festering beneath is actually a "plant horror" boss rusher with twin stick melee controls, unlockable "Instinct" abilities and one-hit deaths.
In a gift to headline writers everywhere, the developers, four-person Gardenfiend Games, are calling it "Hollow Knight meets Titan Souls", and who am I to deny them? It's got one of those "painterly" art styles, too, though other words come to mind, such as "rotted" and "unhallowed" and "manky". It's out on 6th September.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Okay, listen. The Roads To Power expansion coming to Crusader Kings III is focusing on the Byzantine Empire. But forget that. Because today developers Paradox revealed the ins and outs of another feature from the DLC that is way more exciting than some fusty old Greeks. It's called "landless adventurers" and it'll let you play as disgraced dirtbag travelling the world in a sort of medieval gig economy. You'll be making camp, gathering followers, taking random jobs from local rulers, and catching infectious diseases as you try to travel safely through war-torn regions. It sounds amazing.

My feelings about the series have settled back from self-righteous fury over its Pentagon-sponsored war-fellating to a quieter, regretful sense that there have maybe been enough Call Of Duty games now, and that it would be nice if we could fill that infamous late October/early November release slot with, I don't know, games about witches instead, or maybe just turn it into a public holiday and spend the week lying on a mattress regarding the ceiling. Still: I've skinned and filleted enough COD in my time to know that Black Ops 6's new "omnimovement" system is going to ruffle as many feathers as it smooths. The short version is that it turns you into Max Payne.

I think about this quite often, actually, as someone whose largely offline friends (or Fortnite/FIFA pals) ask me to recommend them a game that's good or interesting. Show them something popular like Elden Ring and, despite its grandeur, it might prove too much in all facets. But Vampire Survivors? It's an easy sell: simple, digestible, ridiculous value.
All of this is to say, One BTN Bosses is from the same school of the easy sell. You can fight bosses with one hand in a packet of pickled onion Space Raiders, after all.

You get your bearings, and you soon meet up with another, only slightly irritating, small child. His name is Kimothy, which sounds like something you’d only say as a joke to annoy friends named Kim, and then only once because it would be stupid to say it again. It’s fine! Leaves flutter, rays of sun cavort through trees, and the music is utterly gorgeous. The game opens on twinkly piano and mournful strings, infused with a good dose of stirring JRPG whimsy, and soon transforms into whatever the genre of music is called that makes you want to immediately go on a massive adventure. Potion-punk. Slime-swing. Limit breakcore etc.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Is early adoption a chump’s game? I dunno about that, though between the Asus ROG Ally X and the Steam Deck OLED, those who stayed their hand on their earlier handheld gaming PC counterparts do have a couple of quality second-genners to choose from. Valve’s effort manages to wring multiple performance, design, and battery life improvements out of its new display, while the ROG Ally X makes similar upgrades with a bigger-yet-better take on the original ROG Ally.
The only thing to do, clearly, is make them fight. It’s probably in the Irish Code Duello or something: "Should one portable games box impugn another’s honour by releasing shortly after it, satisfaction must be claimed through a comparison article." My hands are bound here, folks, though if you yourself have been playing the waiting game on a handheld purchase, perhaps this little head-to-head can help you pick the right one.

You awake to a world of tree trunks that twist like viscera and corroded contraptions powered by luminous goop that’s stored in the balls, uh, big glass orbs. A beam of light soon fills your character with newfound vigour, which is a nice moment of triumph in what otherwise feels like a deeply oppressive rust pit, all unsteady platforms and jagged pipes.
It doesn’t take long before you start spotting examples of the reason Bionic Bay went viral earlier this week. Above your head hangs a painstakingly detailed mass of vents and cables, looming lifelike with dust and shadow and history. I stood and stared because I’d seen how the sausage was made, but I like to think I would have lingered longer than usual anyway. It really is just that impressive.

The open-air town square event was a great success, but not without critique. Watermarks on the meters-high screen showed that the public was watching a pirated copy of the film.  When the press got wind of it, the major countered that "everyone was happy", which is hard to argue with, especially since there are no official cinemas nearby.

Last week it was carnivorous post-Soviet elevators, now it’s retro fantasy RPGs that devour themselves. In Super Dungeon Muncher, you are a teeny-tiny hero navigating a corridor-shaped map full of fireball traps and crumbling platforms, spinning coins and patrolling critters.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the neat things about Norland's fantasy medievalism is that specialist knowledge is tied to characters. So if there's only one person in your village who knows how to brew tastier beer, and they die after being freakishly savaged by a passing wolf (it happens), suddenly your village will have no artisanal lager master. The results may be devastating. Luckily, you can share knowledge in a number of ways - by copying books, or having "wise conversations". The exception to this is child characters, whose pea-sized brains can't learn specialist knowledge, only soaking up basic attributes like "manners" from the teachers you assign to them. Well, until now. The developers for the Rimworld-meets-Crusader Kings catastrophe simulator have made kids a little smarter. They'll now learn more important things from their adult teachers.

Baldur’s Gate 3 itself looks to be done and dusted following the upcoming patch, but Larian now seem to be gearing up for their next charm offensive with a new “community focused” YouTube channel, as well as further teasing their two games currently in development.

July has shrivelled up like a freshly laundered sock left on the radiator for too long, and yet, it's still hot enough that even typing the word radiator makes me want to inject concentrated Solero straight into my bloodstream. With my last remaining un-fugged brain cells, I have wrenched this column back from its hiatus, and who better than to get us into the swing of things once more than Baldur’s Gate 3 lead writer and bloody RPS legend Adam Smith! Cheers Adam! Mind if we have a nose at your bookshelf?

Friend, here is what driving games have taught me: traffic lights are there for regional flavour; drifting is the same thing as cornering; other cars exist to serve as bumper cushions when overshooting a turn. Certainly, nobody wants a guy whose ideas about automobiles come from 2018's Wreckfest to be involved in the school run. On which note: THQ Nordic have just announced Wreckfest 2 - a fresh helping of destruction derby with fancified visuals and newly animate drivers who flinch and gesticulate when other drivers smash into them. Witness the carnage in the announcement trailer below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's a hell of a thing to showcase a remake weeks after kiboshing the developers of the original game. In early July, Gothic creators Piranha Bytes were reportedly shuttered as part of Embracer Group's mad race to trim costs, following their decade-long acquisition binge. Watching THQ Nordic's new Gothic Remake trailer, below, feels a little like watching a vivisectionist parade about in somebody else's skin. Still, the remake's developers Alkimia Interactive aren't to blame for Embracer's fuck-ups, and I am selfishly happy to see Gothic return as an Unreal Engine 5 production - even if I didn't play the original back in 2001.


Sin did play the original game, and in her 2016 retrospective, she paints an absorbing picture of a dark fantasy "microsociety" in which every community "has a reason to exist, a means of providing for itself, a social order, and a long term goal". It's a setup that reminds me of my beloved Roadwarden, even as the sight of grumpy lizards slinking through undergrowth has me silently mouthing "fus roh dah".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Titan Quest 2! Now there's a name you can set your watch by. No colons, no bespoke jargon, no tortuous subtitles like "Gaia's B.O.U.N.T.Y." or "Hyperion's Wild Rumpus" - just the steadying prospect of a titanic quest that, who knows, may involve actual titans. The action-RPG beneath the moniker appears similarly straightforward: it's about following a plot thread through a mythological world in top-down view, smashing Ancient Greek giga-crabs and the like to obtain shinier, pointier varieties of gear. I'm sure I don't need to tell you that there's an endgame in which you farm monsters for crafting materials.


Like Pandora opening her box, but without the accompanying tidal wave of sickness, curses and death, THQ Nordic have released a new trailer that talks you though all of this in detail. Here it is...

Envisaged as a Destiny spin-off, rather than Destiny 3, it was apparently dropped "a while ago".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The first World Of Goo was a cheerful parade of goopy engineering with a sense of never-ending novelty (well, never-ending for about four hours). Every level would introduce a new goo type or a twist on the basic bridge-building puzzle that challenged you to get a gaggle of gurgling balls to the nearest pipe. World Of Goo 2 pursues that sense of novelty with just as much twitchy eagerness as its predecessor, throwing new toys and goos at the player in an effort to keep you on your sludge-coated toes. That pursuit doesn't always result in pleasing new levels, though. There is a "hit and miss" feeling to things this time around. But those hits are hits. For anyone who has spent the last 16 years yearning for more sticky structure-building: I hope you like comically unpredictable fluids.

Made with input from former CS pro and streamer Shroud, it looks a bit like a mix of CS and Valorant, but has a big gimmick that sets it apart from the two: you can swap between two bodies.

The latest cuts were necessary to prevent continued losses, says the report, after Bungie missed Sony’s targets following the release of last year’s Lightfall.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[THQ Nordic have announced The Eternal Life Of Goldman, a hand-drawn platformer from This Is The Police and Hollywood Animal devs Weappy. I caught a brief presentation earlier in the week and yeah, this seems promising. On the one hand, it reminds me of cheery 16-bit hop 'n' boppers like, say, the Mega Drive adaptation of Disney's Aladdin. On the other, it makes me think of side-scrolling Soulslikes (Scroulslikes?) such as Blasphemous and the frantic worldbuilding of Rick & Morty.

Population: 8 - one for every non-residential building in town. Major imports: ornamental lampposts, because I like to cultivate an old-timey mood. Major exports: traffic jams, because I've laid out my village in the form of a small crescent leading back to the freeway, which means that there are two traffic light junctions about 100 metres apart.

It got shut down last year as Activision focused their efforts elsewhere, making the map unplayable. But you can now revisit those bullet-strewn beaches. In theory, anyway. Activision have released it as a 4GB open-source project that can be explored in a 3D model-viewing tool. That's cool. But among their reasons for doing so, there lies a predictably grubby logic: they want people to use the data to train AI.

In my brief time with massive Fallout 4 mod Fallout London, I’ve read a delightful terminal entry about a scientist who named his favourite radiated shrew “Big Dave,” thwacked several of said Radshrews with a walking stick, gulped down some expired pink wafers, and been informed of train delays due to “leaves on the track.”
“A British transport joke!” I said to myself, marinating in the sufficient amount of crown-mandated mild amusement. “Our organ-floggingly expensive yet vital public services are crap!” I was having a good time. Then the game public transported me straight to my desktop, and continued to do so at regular intervals over the next few hours, ranging from “just as this conversation was getting good” to “just as my save was about to load.” My upper lip almost quivered, I tell you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I don't think I'm capable of rivalling Nic's enthusiasm for Promise Mascot Agency, the new open world game from Paradise Killer devs Kaizen Game Works, so I'll settle for saying "EEEEE". The developers have just released a nine-minute explainer video, which teems with scenes of gimp suits, winged vans, rocket-propelled pinkies, vicious card battles against small excited dogs, and a surprisingly in-depth management component. There are bits that make me think of Batman: Arkham City, and bits that make me think of Pathologic, and bits that make me think of Yakuza - a combination fit to burst the brain. Quick, before your brain bursts, watch the video for yourself below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Every time I step out of an elevator, I accelerate wildly in case the elevator falls without warning and chops me in half, leaving the frontal and, all things considered, inferior portion of my body swaying in place for a second before collapsing in a cloud of bisected bone and organ. Don't laugh: I know you do this too. Kletka isn't helping: created by in404, it's a horror scavenging game reminiscent of Lethal Company and Golden Light, in which you ponderously plummet through the layers of an "endless" post-Soviet Gigastructure, scrounging fuel, parts and provender for an elevator that wants to eat you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While he's "blown away" by the beach scenes in the first GTA 6 trailer, former Rockstar North technical director Obbe Vermeij thinks the forthcoming open worlder might underwhelm players hoping for a palpable technological update on GTA 5, which has been reworked and re-released extensively since its 2013 launch. This has less to do with GTA in itself, Vermeij says, than with the fact that changes in computing capacity today simply aren't as dramatic as in the days of the very first PlayStation. It's becoming rare, he suggests, that you see a "jump" akin to GTA going 3D.

So it comes as great news, then, that the devs have somehow taken that perfect dome, expanded it and polished it to an even greater sheen. We're talking about new guild assignments, new gadgets, better world generation, a new world, new monsters. The list is enormous and designed expressly around improved replayability - take that, Las Vegas Dome.

Among the wonderful sights contained in space-poking adventure game The Great Fluctus are: beans, slug milk, alien volleyball, egg arguments, and massive frog. Additional screenshots suggest this frog later acquires wings. Like a captive Generation Game host, I am helpless but to shout out more incredible sights as they flutter past on the conveyor belt of pure flippin' videogame before me. It’s got dance parties with horrible gorilla aliens. It’s got building, namely the Statue Of Liberty out of goop, just as George Washington’s goop clone intended. It’s also got just sitting on a bench, enjoying some lovely serene space scenery.  Feast your famished face on the trailer.

Specifically, laidback intercity services with nobody else in the quiet car and certainly, none of those screeching smaller bipeds, or "children" as they are scientifically known. That idyll is now lost to me thanks to Covid: I have vulnerable family members and continue to be careful about social distancing. As such I spend most train journeys these days lurking between carriages, trolling the door sensors and scowling furiously at anybody who visits the loo. But now, thanks to the obscene magic of video games, I can get my fill of authorial locomotivation once again.

In a pastime that’s had several decades to perfect the art of hitting men with sharp objects, that’s quite the accomplishment. Since releasing in 2022, Torn Banner have lavished the player base with free horses, angry peasants, and most recently, the Regicide update - hosting a climatic tete-a-tete between two angry crownmen. With work on No More Room In Hell 2 well underway though, Torn Banner have decided to call it on Chiv 2, which they now consider “feature complete.”

Original story:
Earlier this month it was reported that Skibidi Toilet, the YouTube phenomenon, may be heading to film and television via director Michael Bay. Now Invisible Narratives, a production company co-owned by Bay, has apparently sent a DMCA takedown notice to Garry Newman, citing the large number of Skibidi Toilet games and assets advertised within Garry's Mod.

Skibidi Toilet uses assets derived from Half-Life 2, however, and owes a lot to the Garry's Mod machinima scene. And the animation's original creator, best known as DaFuqBoom, is claiming innocence over the DMCA.

Whereas AMD’s first take on driver-level frame generation – the same kind of framerate-roiding image generation trickery that FSR 3 and DLSS 3 are based around – came yoked to a barrel of jittering, stuttering, and visual artefacting issues, Fluid Motion Frames 2 is as smooth and you’d like. Without compromising on the ability to deploy it in theoretically any DirectX 11- or 12-based game, too.

Peel back the curtains of American cultural hegemony however and you may find the true pulsing core of British comedy that lies beneath: innuendo. No American network is in a bidding war to import Vic and Bob or remake Bottom, and Carry On and Benny Hill are assumed to be anachronisms in our modern times, but Thank Goodness You're Here! enters the conversation with a nudge and a wink. It's a cheeky 2-3 hour adventure through a small northern town, and it's here to educate the entire world of our nation's obsession with sausages and bare bottoms.

I enjoy the militant reductiveness of this character motivation. There are sprawling underground ecosystems to discover, yes, weird plants to harvest, fractious clumps of tentacles to appraise, avoid or slaughter. But all of these things are contemptible details to be swept up and bagged and thrown in the dumpster.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Karaoke may not scale the heights of popularity it once did in the West, but after more than 50 years the format may still be generating around $5 billion a year for rightsholders. That may explain why Hong Kong Customs carried out a month-long crackdown, arrested 18 people, and for the very first time, seized hardware and remote servers powering an online karaoke streaming system.

He wants to do this using cards. There are 47 of them - a forest of silhouettes, laid across the blood-stained table between you. Every turn, you flip a tree card to reveal a flame. When the flames spread to a player’s Tower card, it’s game over.

In India, the practice was elevated to a criminal offense last year and law enforcement is on high alert. A few days ago, a camming suspect was caught in the act after the filming angle of a previous upload, reportedly identified the cinema and a 'hot seat'.

Stumbling parched through a desert as a bed of scorpions prick your ankles with deadly venom?

You'll now be able to choose from several difficulty presets to dampen or spice up the game's challenge. Otherwise, there's new customisation options and some quality of life tweaks, too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Overwatch 2 director Aaron Keller has posted a lengthy blog on Steam about the transition from 6v6 player matches in the first Overwatch to 5v5 in the poorly received free-to-play sequel. It's a juicy read for armchair designers and lapsed Overwatchers like myself, packing in analysis of class roles and the shift from the free choice of heroes to single hero picks and enforced team compositions.
In broad strokes, Keller summarises how the Overwatch experience has drifted away from "player freedom and creativity in order to create a more balanced, consistent and competitive experience for players". It's possible, however, that Overwatch 2 will swing back in the other direction, as Blizzard are now "exploring how we can test different forms of 6v6 in the game to gauge the results", with a view to restoring some of the joyful chaos that saw entire teams of Reinhardts charging the objective in formation.

They often feel like a casualty of Marvel movie bloat. Mortal Kombat 1 was marketed as a "reboot", for example, but is really just a continuation of previous nonsense, with developers NetherRealm saying "I don't know, stick a multiverse in it." Yet from that multiverse now arrives another bad guy, bringing new story chapters for the fighting game's first big expansion, as well as extra characters like the liquid metal murderer from Terminator 2, a Conan of the barbarian persuasion, and the masked killer of the Scream movies.

Sorry, America! Anyway, let's have a looksie at the PC game release sheets.
