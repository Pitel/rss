It's been over six months since our last round, so it's time for another batch of NL 'reader recommendations' with Part 6 of our Games We Missed series.
We asked you recently to send us your nominations for Switch games we weren't able to review for one reason or another that you think deserve highlighting in this article. With the sheer quantity of games hitting the Switch eShop on a weekly basis, it's impossible for us to keep up — believe us, nobody knows how many we're missing more than we do!

Has it sunk in yet that almost every single mainline Final Fantasy game between I and XII is now available on the Switch? That's thanks to this week's release of the Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster series, which was long, long overdue.
Back when the games launched on Steam and mobile between 2021 and 2022, lots of people were happy that the classic six Final Fantasy games were finally being made more accessible. But there was one big talking point that swept across the world when it came to the Pixel Remasters — the font.

The League of Legends universe is pretty big at this point, as the MOBA has spun out into series, collaborations, and even other genres. The Mageseeker is the latest of these efforts to create a compelling story within the world of Runeterra, creating a new flavor of League storytelling with an action RPG coating. And, for the most part, it works.
Developer Digital Sun, known for their own previous action RPG Moonlighter, definitely makes its mark on the League timeline. A focus on Sylas, the once-chained mage now caught between his potential as a revolutionary and his selfish desire for revenge, lends itself well to both a different kind of story and an interesting take on combat.

I'm most certainly looking forward to resting up today, and I hope that, wherever you are and however you're doing, that you too find the opportunity to take some time for yourself and recover from the trials and tribulations of the week.
Have yourself some coffee and cake. Or whatever floats your throat boat. I know I'm going to be treating myself today, and I think that you should to. Ahhhh, that's some quality enabling.

Hello folks, and welcome to another edition of Box Art Brawl!
Before we get cracking with this week's rumble, let's take a look at how the votes panned out last time. We took a look at Professor Layton and the Curious Village for the DS and, holy moly, it was actually a rather close call. North America won out with 48% of the vote, with Europe just missing out with 41%. Finally, Japan wasn't quite able to win the hearts of our voters and pulled in just 11% of the vote.

Something particularly fun and adorable from Hamster this week, as it bolsters its mammoth Arcade Archives range with the addition of Namco's cutesy '90s shmup Cosmo Gang the Video, now available to download on PS4 and Nintendo Switch.
Released to Japanese arcades in 1992, before receiving a home release on Super Famicom shortly thereafter, Cosmo Gang the Video is a spin-off shooter featuring characters that appeared in iconic redemption game Cosmo Gangs, a title which saw the player battling to prevent a squad of crazy-eyed creatures from stealing energy boxes to take back to their home planet. Cosmo Gang the Video adapts these characters and settings to a vertically scrolling shmup format, a genre in which Namco had proven itself a frontrunner.
https://youtu.be/kfI4Z_P5joA
One to two players pilot the "Hyper Beat" space vessels, on a mission to fend off the Cosmo Gang, who has returned to cause further mayhem across the galaxy. The player battles waves of formation-based enemies over the course of 30+ stages, picking up power-ups and new weapons in order to even the odds against the Cosmo Gang's seemingly endless numbers. It should be noted that, despite its latter-day release date, the title is simplistic, even dated, when compared to the contemporary shmups of the day. Despite this, the arcade saw great success in its native Japan.
Cosmo Gang the Video is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at around $8. You Check out the very silly action in the video above, courtesy of YouTuber Insert Coin.

It's 2009, and I go to my first-ever midnight launch for a game. Infamous was the next big exclusive game for the PS3, and I was incredibly excited. I was in my final weeks of high school, in the middle of exam season in the UK. I took the game home, unwrapped it, and played all night until around 7 am. I had an exam the following day, but I didn't care. I just had to play that game.
Fast forward to 2023, and I couldn't tell you what exam I was supposed to be studying for. I couldn't tell you whether I passed it or failed it, and it doesn't matter. The memory of lining up for the midnight launch of Infamous and playing it all night will stay with me forever. The next few weeks, while I should have been studying for other exams, I was instead playing Infamous. …]]></summary>

Nintendo has always been one for pushing the boat out with its hardware designs, and no more so is this the case than with its controllers. Yes, those of the NES and SNES were pretty conventional by today's standards (though they were remarkably innovative at the time) but in the ensuing years, the Big N's controllers have had us waving blocks above our heads, tapping chunky kidney-shaped keys, attaching and detaching buttoned bolt-ons, and even trying to work out how exactly these are meant to be played with only two hands.
Our point is, there's a lot to choose from when it comes to finding the best Nintendo controller out there. There are so many different options, in fact — and so many different opinions — that attempting to find "the best" feels somewhat like an impossible task.

With Street Fighter 6, Capcom is looking to revitalize the energy and the aesthetic of its flagship fighting franchise — This is perhaps best demonstrated in the audio/visual style of the new sequel and its roster, every member of which is embodying a fresh "back to the streets" design style — A style equally reflected in their respective character themes.
Here is every Street Fighter 6 character theme released to date, as well as the hype-building title theme "Not on the Sidelines" by Rocco808 and Randy Marx. Which of the character themes are doing it for you? My personal favorites are Ken, Juri, Lily, and Kimberly. Let us know what you think.

Shikigami no Shiro, or Castle of Shikigami in localisation, is a shooting game series by Alfa System, a studio that once upon a time pitched in on the likes of Wonder Boy III and several Ys ports for the PC Engine CD-ROM.
Castle of Shikigami’s main series spans three games, and, despite the third entry’s intriguing Hi-Tension bomb mechanic, the second remains the best overall. Port developer Cosmo Machia and publisher Degica, who is no stranger to revamping shooting games, have pulled out all the stops to make this re-release the absolute best version available.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Celebrating 10 years of meetups this August.
In the gaming industry, Nintendo sets itself apart not just with the quality of its games and its evergreen catalogue of classic characters, but also a focus on community. Whether through software that brings people of all ages together, hardware features like StreetPass, or the local multiplayer functionality baked into every single Switch console, Nintendo is particularly great at firing up positivity for gaming and giving like-minded fans cause to get together to play and celebrate the games they love. It's why we're here writing about them, and why you're here reading about them. Various Nintendo-focused communities have formed around the world over the years and in the United Kingdom, Nintendo Players UK is the largest.
An independent 'umbrella' network of Nintendo fans, NPUK organises physical meetups for gamers in the UK and Ireland and is made up of 29 individual regional communities. Jen Griffiths is part of the NPUK committee and head administrator for this inclusive gaming hub, one which is fast approaching its ten-year milestone this August. "Our ethos," Jen tells us via email, "is simply to provide free events in person that are inclusive and family-friendly spaces for Nintendo fans to meet and play games with each other."

The scans themselves come from the Japan-exclusive Pokémon Gold and Silver Pokédex. In other words, this wasn’t something provided as a special case from Nintendo. The images washed out when they came West, but so many sources distributed them that they became ubiquitous.

Some need acquired tastes like licorice (It Takes Two) while many others will enjoy a beloved, comfortable chocolate bar (Minecraft). However, there is at least one sweet game you'll enjoy with the service. Here are the 10 best games on Xbox Game Pass right now.

Suburban Basketball is one of those games where I’m completely uncertain if the developer, Quinn Tonelli, intended it to be art, but that’s how it ended up. You’re probably either going to look at the below screenshots and either scoff and assume I’m daft, or you’ll say, “Oh golly, this sings to me.”
It’s a Doom mod that escaped from the shallow grave where we left Web 1.0. It’s the sort of dream that dial-up modems wake up screaming from. It brings me back to the days of exploring the filthy, disease-ridden alleyways of the ‘90s and early 2000s. That’s how I know it’s art: it elicits a reaction, even if that reaction is flashbacks of fever dreams caused by a combination of heat stroke and researching how to catch the Pokegods.

Hi-Fi Rush was a bit of a surprise drop earlier this year, and certainly made a splash. But as a report circulated that it did not hit its revenue target, Xbox is saying that Hi-Fi Rush was a break out hit.
The back-and-forth started when journalist Jeff Grubb, on the Game Mess Decides podcast, said that Hi-Fi Rush fell short of what it "needed" to do.
"Based on what I've heard, it just straight up didn't make the money it needed to make," Grubb said. "And, I mean, it got good reviews, buzz was good. So where do you put the blame for something like that? And it's like, is it the price? Was it the shadow drop? Or could it have sold more? Or is it Game Pass?"

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is our new song
Content creator Markiplier has announced that he’ll be writing, directing, and starring in a film based on David Szymanski’s short-form horror game, Iron Lung.
Released in 2021, Iron Lung became a surprise hit. Oh, hey, I’m even quoted on the Steam page. I absolutely loved it, as it was everything short-form horror should be. It was short, inventive, and also horror. It was more atmospheric than scary, so some people told me they found it boring, which hurt my ego. My recommendations are a lot like my children. I send them out in the world without fulling preparing them, and if they don’t succeed immediately, I feel unreasonably disappointed.
In any case, this adaptation of Iron Lung aims to be a theatrical feature. I’m not sure how you turn a 30-45 minute interactive experience into a 90+ minute feature without losing some of the mystique, but here we go. While Markiplier is writing and starring in the film, David Szymanski has been involved and assisting, and that includes helping create the script.
https://twitter.com/DUSKdev/status/1649452805818658817?s=20
Many of the details surrounding the adaptation are under wraps, but we do know it will co-star Caroline Rose Kaplan. Markiplier is financing the film by himself. While it hasn’t been revealed if the film will follow the plot of the game – which involved using a submarine to explore an ocean of blood in a universe where all habitable planets abruptly disappeared – David Szymanski says he “couldn't be happier with how it's turning out so far.”
I don’t have many strong feelings here. I play things, but I rarely watch them. Therefore, both Markiplier and films as a whole are in my periphery, along with sports and human interaction. There’s no reason an Iron Lung movie couldn’t work, so here’s hoping the team can pull it off.

Join us today Friday on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central as we kick of the adventure, which will continue each week until we roll credits. We'll also have every episode available the next day on our Game Informer Shows YouTube Channel. 
Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts was released for the Xbox 360 on November 11, 2008. The third (and, so far, final) entry in Rare's beloved platforming series centers on vehicle creation, where players collect and slap together hundreds of parts to assemble their own wacky contraptions to explore. The bevy of possible combinations and emphasis on player choice and creativity was largely unprecedented at the time, paving the way for future games such as the upcoming The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. However, this direction would divide fans due to how much it strays from the traditional Banjo formula. So where will I land on it? Let's find out.
Join me, Marcus Stewart, alongside Kyle Hilliard as we explore one of the Xbox 360's biggest hidden gems to see whether it holds up or falls apart like a poorly constructed doohickey.

Artificial intelligence use in games has quickly become a hot-button topic, and for good reason. The rise of systems that generate text, images, or anything else has open a bit of a Pandora's Box in terms of original sourcing, ethics, and specifically for games, how something gets made.

Publisher Focus Entertainment continues on its journey to grow as a company and as a brand within the market, announcing that it has acquired Railsimulator(dot)com, the parent company of train sim studio Dovetail Games.
The purchase sees Focus secure 100% of all Dovetail Games shares, as well as ownership of the British studio's niche-but-popular IPs such as Rail Simulator, Train Simulator Classic, and Train Sim World. The studio itself will continue to run under its own steam (no pun intended) via the current leadership team. Speaking to GamesIndustry.biz, Focus spoke of its excitement in purchasing the genre-dedicated developer.
https://twitter.com/Focus_entmt/status/1649088666529304577?s=20
"We like their business model based on fully-owned IPs and creating recurrent revenues from regular content updates to a passionate and committed community of fans," explains Focus Entertainment CEO Sean Brennan. "Dovetail is perfectly aligned with our strategy and is led by a very talented senior management team who are excited about growing the business further."
"[Dovetail management] will keep their distinct culture and way of managing the business for sure, a policy that we have followed with all our past studio acquisitions. We hope we can add value in a number of areas though in order to bring their fantastic games to a wider audience."
Dovetail Games joins Focus' modest but burgeoning portfolio, which also includes Lords of the Fallen developer Deck13, Space Hulk: Deathwing's Streum On Studio, Metal Slug Tactics' Leiker Studio, French studio Douze Dixiemas, and finally the hugely successful, retro-driven outfit Dotemu. Focus also has a close relationship with acclaimed studios such as A Plague Tale's Asobo Studio and Atomic Heart's Mundfish.

It feels like just yesterday that we got the first announcement of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom (affectionately called "the Breath of the Wild sequel" at that point) back in 2019's E3, doesn't it? No. Of course it doesn't. To tell you the truth, we have been counting down the days for this one over the past four years, so you'll have to excuse us for getting a little excited now that we are finally, finally on the home straight.
Of course, a positive to take from this long wait period is that we have come to know Breath of the Wild far better than we might have done if we had received a sequel sooner. For many of us, this version of Hyrule is where we have spent hundreds of hours exploring. We defeated evils, uncovered Shrines, found 900 Korok Seeds (ok, maybe not all of us did that one), and completed a boatload of quests.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! Come on in. Please, take a seat. Welcome to the inaugural episode of our brand new (and currently untitled) supporter-first indie video show! Every month*, I'm going to be spending some time highlighting a cool indie game that deserves your attention. Think of this series as a supplement to Sin's Scout Report or our Indiescovery podcast. A brand new method for delivering piping hot recs from my desktop to yours.
My aim is to use this series as a springboard to dive deep into specific elements of a game I find particularly fascinating, sharing my discoveries with you lot behind the paywall first (and don't worry, regular readers, I'll also be making each of these videos public for all to see after a month, which should roughly coincide with the the next one going live for supporters). In it, I'll be discussing some common themes between multiple games, digging into underappreciated gems from years gone by... The remit is broad and nebulous, to the point where it's clearly obvious why I haven't been able to come up with a name for it yet.

(If you end up thinking of something, please do let me know in the comments. More than anything it'll stop me messaging Katharine a list of awful possibilites every other week, which I can only imagine is negatively effecting her feelings about me, the site and the endeavour of games journalism in general. They really have been that bad, folks. Proper rancid stuff).

Total Tank Generals is possibly the best introduction to wargames I've ever played, but to call it a light strategy game would feel like a disservice. If you're used to heavier fare this may still scratch the itch.
It's not that it's particularly simple, but it feels so damn clean and effortless to play. You'll know what you're doing in minutes, but still find a decent challenge, with lots of options but minimal analysis paralysis. I'm honestly finding it hard to fault.

A new gameplay update is out for Dota 2, and it's a big one. Seemingly everything, from items to hero attribute types and abilities, has been adjusted or altered, and even the map is getting a bit larger.
The 7.33 patch for Dota 2, dubbed the New Frontiers update, hits many points. And though Dota updates have been traditionally massive compared to other live games, this one might be the most game-shifting since at least the 7.0 update.
For starters, the map itself is now 40% larger. New structures line the lanes, with objectives like the Lotus Pools and their fruit, or the vision-providing Watchers. New runes dot the landscape, and neutral creeps—the monsters that live in the jungle between lanes—have been updated and overhauled.

It's a mighty fine weekend for PlayStation fighting game fans, as developer SNK has released a demo for its top-tier scrapper The King of Fighters XV on both PS4 & PS5 platforms. Available on PSN right now, the trial gives players a chance to check out the 2022 team-based battler.
The demo allows users to engage in three-on-three battles in an offline capacity, opening up the fighters' VS. mode, as well as its deep Training options. Players can take on the CPU or a local friend in exhibition bouts, utilizing a team of 15 characters pulled from KoF XV's massive roster of sluggers. It should be noted that the demo is standalone, and will not carry over any data should you pull the trigger on a full purchase.
The 15 characters included in the demo are *deep breath*
Athena Asamiya (Super Heroine Team)
Benimaru Nikaido (Hero Team)
Chizuru Kagura (Sacred Treasures Team)
Chris (Orochi Team)
Dolores (Rival Team)
Heidern (Rival Team)
Iori Yagami (Sacred Treasures Team)
Isla (Rival Team)
Kula Diamond (Krohnen Team)
Kyo Kusanagi (Sacred Treasures Team)
Mai Shiranui (Super Heroine Team)
Meitenkun (Hero Team)
Ryo Sakazaki (Art of Fighting Team)
Shun’ei (Hero Team)
Terry Bogard (Fatal Fury Team)
Released in February of last year, The King of Fighters XV is an excellent entry in SNK's storied series, featuring a huge roster, incredibly deep and complex mechanics, and audio and visuals upgraded from its predecessor. This year will see SNK release several further characters to the title, including intolerable KoF '98 boss Goenitz, fan-designed vigilante Najd, and the nightmare bundle of cuteness that is Svlvie Paula Paula.
The King of Fighters XV is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox Series X.

Handhelds are prone to a certain amount of wear and tear over time: and I should talk, as someone who owns a collection of them! Some of mine are completely beaten up from constant use (and dropping them as a kid), and others are in pristine condition: compliments of my collector habits throughout my lifetime. But whatever the case might be, if you need a 3DS (or 2DS, or New 3DS, and so on) battery pack, Nintendo has official ones in stock now: no need to worry about a secondhand clunker.
[gallery columns="2" size="large" ids="374741,374742"]
All the links for 3DS battery pack restocks
Here's the full replacement landing page for the 2DS/3DS. Note that some things might say "out of stock," but as of the time of publication, clicking on those items will actually produce an "add to cart" in-stock notice.
Here's the link to the New Nintendo 3DS XL and Nintendo 3DS XL battery packs - $14.99
Here's the link to the Nintendo 3DS and Nintendo 2DS battery packs - $14.99
If you're the type of person who constantly plays 3DS and is enjoying all of those now-dead games, you might want to grab an extra or two for your model of choice. These things are relatively cheap by Nintendo standards and aren't always in stock. Remember that Nintendo changed their policy to allow free shipping for orders over $50.
Nintendo does have a helpful tip for those of you who are having 3DS issues though:
"If your system is not charging or holding a charge properly, we recommend checking our troubleshooting before deciding on a replacement. You'll need a small phillips tip screwdriver (not included) to open the battery compartment before you can replace the battery."

That troubleshooting page can be found here.

Remember when we were all speculating about roles and cameos in Illumination's Super Mario Bros. Movie? Well, one of the movie's biggest mysteries has now been solved, as we now know who the voice for the lady in the Super Mario Bros. Plumbing commercial is. And it isn't who many suspected it would be.
Back in February, a teaser for the movie — which was a commercial for the Mario brothers' new plumbing company --- dropped during the Super Bowl, featuring a new rendition of the theme to the Super Mario Bros. Super Show. But that wasn't what caught everyone's ear, as many thought that the woman in the commercial was voiced by none other than Jeannie Alias, the voice of Princess Toadstool (aka Princess Peach) in the 1989 cartoon.

In KarmaZoo, teams of 10 randomly gathered players must use spirit, synergy, and even sacrifice in order to navigate a near-endless range of procedurally generated stages, all created within a pixel-perfect realm known as "The Loop". The 10-strong team must capitalize on a huge menagerie of characters, (including a returning PixelCat), abilities, and perks in order to ensure that the whole squad, (well, not always the whole squad), is able to find their respective path through the level and, hopefully, get to the finish line unscathed.
Helping your teammates, leading the herd, and even committing self-sacrifice so that others may continue will all earn your character the precious resource, Karma, which can be used to unlock new characters, perks, stages, and much more. Check out the action in this announcement trailer.

In addition to The Loop, KarmaZoo also supports several local multiplayer modes, in which you can challenge friends and family to a variety of party-style games, such as being the first to reach the summit of a mountain, races through auto-scrolling mazes and labyrinths, and other quick-fire mini-games. Conquer as many as possible to claim your rightful place on top of the celebratory "Totem".
KarmaZoo looks like a great time-filler — especially for those homestead gatherings — sporting cute graphics, fun characters, and a nice spirit of teamwork and camaraderie. Definitely worth keeping an eye on this release as we closer to its launch window. KarmaZoo is scheduled to launch this summer on PS5, PC, Xbox Series X, and Nintendo Switch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We're close to launch
Although Nintendo dubbed the most recent event for Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom the "final trailer," they weren't counting commercials! The Nintendo of Japan YouTube account dropped several new videos late last night, and they have kernels of new footage to peruse.
Those kernels are very "blink and you'll miss it" stuff (including the beach scene), as much of the reels from the trio of commercials include compilations of the prior two major trailers (the 10-minute one and the aforementioned "final" trailer). I mean, I think Zelda fans are already sold, and potentially at their limit of what they wanted to see. Going in blind in Tears of the Kingdom is probably going to be really rewarding for folks, especially when it comes to discerning the little mechanical nuances between the sequel and its predecessor.
Funnily enough, these clips do give you a pretty good idea of what to expect from the Japanese voice cast, which sounds fantastic. You can check out all three commercials below, or peruse through the Japanese Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom site.

Nintendo also dropped a Zelda: Breath of the Wild recap video just in time
In case you need a refresher, you can check out this recap video that goes through the entire plot of the previous game: Breath of the Wild. Note that there are spoilers present (!) and you don't need to understand Japanese to get the gist of what's going on.
Odds are you've already played Breath of the Wild and were one of the millions who experienced it, but you never know!

Remember when Lemmings was all the rage? It’s hard to imagine that the studio that would go on to develop the monumentally successful Grand Theft Auto franchise made such a quaint little puzzler. Lemmings was a darn good game, spawning multiple add-ons and sequels over the years. It’s honestly a little surprising that the franchise hasn’t yet seen a (re)release on the Switch.
Enter Tin Hearts. Created by ex-Fable developers over at Rogue Sun, Tin Hearts is a heartwarming mix of environmental storytelling and Lemmings-like puzzle gameplay. Indeed, the whole premise of the game requires you to guide a troop of “mischievous tin soldiers’ through increasingly complex paths from their starting position to the end goal.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This seems like an oversight
Remember when Advance Wars 1+2 Re-Boot Camp was announced in 2021? Remember when it was delayed, and for how long?! Well if you asked me to recall the whole situation off the top of my head, it would just feel like one big haze. In reality, it's been roughly a year (and change). Well, if those physical copies were printed ages ago, the ability to redeem Gold (bonus) Points on the Switch eShop could be impacted.
As reported by Nintendo Life (and pretty much all over every other Nintendo community), some folks are having problems redeeming their Gold Points. As a reminder, people who buy Nintendo games have the ability to earn Gold Points (which can be used to buy games directly) either through a digital purchase (which is done automatically), or a manual redemption of a game cart. But there is a limit on how long that physical redemption process is good for, and it varies from region to region.
Nintendo is reportedly investigating the issue, and we've reached out for comment. This seems like a pretty easy fix, as Nintendo can spare some funny money that encourages people to spend more real money on their storefront.
The community is chiming in as well to note that you should keep trying at an irregular interval, as it could end up going through at a later date. I can back this up with experience, as the Gold Point redemption process can be pretty wonky: speaking as someone who has dealt with early review copies.

We know what you're thinking, and yes, we only recently highlighted a wonderful animation for The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom in the style of the Game Boy Color. But we're back with another find and this time it's a beautiful Game Boy interpretation of the main theme from the upcoming game.
Posted on YouTube by New Age Retro Hippie, the video showcases footage from the most recent trailer, but with a green Game Boy filter applied to it. The real star of the show, however, is the music itself. It works so well in that typical Game Boy style, and it's genuinely making us wish for a proper Tears of the Kingdom Game Boy game.

As reported by the Australian website Vooks, an attempt to redeem the points results in an error code that states "You cannot collect My Nintendo points for this software as the expiry date has passed".

In total, 31 sites were shut down and another five threw in the towel.

World Tour begins with players creation a custom fighter that serves as the mode’s protagonist. Upon creating your avatar (which can be used outside of World Tour in the online Battle Hub), you’re dropped into Metro City from the Final Fight series, one of the World Tour’s many explorable city hubs.

Capcom hosted a new digital showcase for Street Fighter 6 today, going into lengthy detail about what's in store for the next fighting game entry. We got a good look at what to expect, from fighting in the streets to travelling around the world.
Hosted by Lil' Wayne, who appeared just a handful of times (and sadly did not get confirmed as a fight commentator), the stream spent about 30 minutes running through all the features of Street Fighter 6. We even got confirmation of the first year's worth of DLC and a surprise demo drop for some of SF6's new features.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Much like its predecessor, Street Fighter 6 will have an ambitious post-release content plan. While we knew there would be downloadable content, we now have a much better idea about the cadence with which the new characters will arrive.
"A big part of Street Fighter's charm is the cast of characters from around the world that appear in each game," executive producer Shuhei Matsumoto said during today's Street Fighter 6 Showcase livestream. "We believe that Street Fighter is where players can take control of unique characters with their own awesome fighting styles. For the players – and for us as well – the appeal of the characters themselves is the most important element of the series. With Street Fighter 6, we're continuing development to deliver new characters to you every year."
During Year 1, which kicks off when the game launches, we will receive four new characters to the Street Fighter 6 roster. Rashid, A.K.I., Ed, and Akuma are the characters who will be made available during this first year of content. Rashid, who debuted in the base version of Street Fighter V, arrives in summer 2023. A.K.I., an all-new character, will arrive in fall 2023. Ed, who debuted in Street Fighter IV but was first playable in Street Fighter V, arrives in the early parts of 2024. Akuma, the Great Demon who first appeared in Super Street Fighter II Turbo, joins Street Fighter 6 in spring 2024. These characters will also appear in World Tour, the single-player RPG-inspired story mode, giving players some insight into their backgrounds.
If you buy either the Deluxe ot Ultimate Editions, you get the Year 1 characters included in that version. Street Fighter 6 arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PC on June 2. For more on the game, check out our exclusive coverage hub here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[(At least look surprised)
During this evening's Street Fighter 6 Showcase stream, Capcom revealed the first wave of DLC characters that are currently throwing shapes in the gym, preparing to grace the ring with their presence in the months following the title's initial release.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKU3ZOvYHnk&ab_channel=StreetFighter
As we may or may not have already known, the first season of DLC characters will consist of Street Fighter V debutante and Master of the Turbulent Wind, Rashid, the rogue Shadaloo runaway, Ed, and the community edgelord's favorite himself, the fearsome Akuma. This trio will be joined by a brand new fighter, AKI, whom right now we know very little about, but appears to be cut from the same cloth as SFV's sinister poison expert FANG.
Street Fighter 6 launches June 2 on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platform. While you wait, be sure to check out our previous articles, including the 50 things I loved about the beta, my impressions on the sequel so far, as well as suggestions on the 10 World Warriors who would fit right into the new title as post-launch DLC.

As part of today's Street Fighter 6 Showcase stream, Capcom announced that it is launching a demo for PS5, giving eager World Warriors the opportunity to check out the single-player adventure campaign, World Tour, one of the many new features that will make up the highly anticipated new release.
The demo, which should be available to download this evening, will let you make up an avatar — which in SF6 rules must have a tiny head, tank-wide thighs, and luminescent, borderline-radioactive skin — before taking a few steps into Metro City as the new student and protege of the one cast member you would never choose to hang out with: Luke.

The demo will allow players to explain the main square of the city, meeting the locals, and then beating the locals in a few "nothing personal" street assaults. This demo will also allow new fans to check out the Modern Control options and get to grips with the general flow of the fight. In the full release, this adventure mode will let players get to grips with many aspects of Street Fighter 6, from basic movement and attacks to new mechanics such as Drive Impact and Drive Rush. You'll also be able to do a lot of shopping — the true path of the World Warrior.
Oh, and be sure to say hi to Alice, your new favorite Street Fighter weirdo.
The Street Fighter 6 World Tour demo is available now on PS5, it will launch on PC and Xbox Series X on April 26. Street Fighter 6 launches on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms June 2, 2023.

[Update: The show's about to begin! Check it out below!]
Capcom is hosting a new showcase for the upcoming Street Fighter 6 on April 20. The new and, from the sounds of it, final extended look at Street Fighter 6 will apparently have some "big news."
The show will air on Capcom's YouTube channel at 3 p.m. PT / 6 p.m. ET on April 20. It's set to host over half an hour of "big news and announcements," all about the upcoming SF6.

Hosting the whole show will be Lil Wayne. It's an interesting pick, for sure. But it's not exactly the first time the artist has crossed over with Street Fighter, either.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[That's a lot of babies
Electronic Arts is celebrating the arrival of the 70 millionth player to The Sims 4. They’re attributing this to the recent Growing Together expansion, but I’m guessing it has more to do with the fact that The Sims 4 became free to play last October.
I wouldn’t assume it’s specifically because of The Sims 4 Growing Together, because that expansion sounds like hell to me. It adds the infant stage of development, taking place between newborn and toddler. That’s all I want: more baby. Whenever my husband plays, he always makes these massive families, and for large swathes of time, all I hear is a cacophony of childhood tantrums next to me.
On the plus side, it does sound like a significant addition to the formula; it’s just one that makes me instinctively clench my jaw.
I keep thinking that The Sims 4 is the only good thing that EA really does anymore. Then I remember that it has a bazillion expansions and DLC packs, with new ones dropping every month or so. Whoops, I nearly gave them some credit. I guess I’ll go back to pointing out that they have their own digital storefront, yet the original Sims title isn’t available, along with, like, 90% of Maxis' simulation franchise.
If I’m being honest, making the base Sims 4 free was a good move, especially if they want to sell more expansions. It’s like what my local drug dealers and gambling lords all agree on: the first hit is free. Once you’ve got them hooked, then you start sucking them dry.
On the other hand, I do think that The Sims 4 is an excellent title after you’ve dumped all your life’s savings into it. I'm not being facetious there; it is a good game. I think it's reasonable to like the game and hate the business model.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Diablo IV may have gone gold, but Blizzard wants to ensure the servers are durable one more time before launch. Thus, it's opening the gates of Sanctuary to players one more time in a third open beta next month. 
This next test weekend, dubbed Server Slam weekend, begins May 12 at 12 p.m. Pacific and ends May 14 at the same time. As the name suggests, Blizzard is running this beta to stress test the servers to make sure they're as sturdy as possible come June. This slice of the game is similar to the March betas in terms of content, but it will include updates and bug fixes garnered from feedback to the previous betas.
Server Slam weekend will be a clean slate as progression from the previous betas does not carry over. Additionally, the beta supports couch co-op, cross-play, and cross-progression. Players can explore Fractured Peaks in its entirety through the Prologue and Act 1, complete World Events, and face Ashava, the toughest available World Boss. Completing challenges can earn the following new rewards:
The Initial Casualty title (earned by reaching Kyovashad with one character)
The Early Voyager title (earned by reaching Level 20 on one character)
The Beta Wolf Pack Cosmetic (earned by reaching Level 20 with one character)
A new reward: the Cry of Ashava Mount Trophy (earned by defeating Ashava with one Level 20 character).
Diablo IV launches on June 6 for PlayStation, Xbox, and PC. It’s also Game Informer’s cover story for this month, and you can subscribe to the digital version of the magazine to read the issue or subscribe to the print edition hitting mailboxes this month.]]></summary>

Folks were hoping for an announcement from the Diablo IV April 2023 developer update live stream: and they got it. There's going to be another beta for D4, and it starts on May 12, 2023.
The official Diablo Twitter account confirmed the news with a simple tweet:
"We've heard your feedback, it's time to visit Sanctuary once more before June. Join the Server Slam, May 12-14"

When is the second Diablo IV beta and what can you do in it?
That "once more"  and "server slam" bits tell us a few things. It seems, without further "feedback" in play, this is the final "we promise" beta period. The official launch is just weeks away on June 6, so there wouldn't be much time to prep and monitor another beta anyway. The phrase "server slam" also strongly hints that this is primarily a stress test to help the team calibrate for launch (crossed fingers this isn't D3 again).
Blizzard subsequently tweeted out more info on this second public beta period, noting that you'll be able to reach level 20, beat Ashava, and earn the Cry of Ashava mount trophy. To think all this was teased earlier this week when that same Twitter account mysteriously alluded to another beta. Hopefully, once June 6 hits we don't all realize we're collectively in another beta: but based on how high folks have been riding on the pre-release of Diablo IV, this could be a much sleeker launch than D3.

Sony is adding another studio the the PlayStation Studios lineup. Today, the publisher announced it is acquiring Firewalk Studios.
In 2021, Sony had confirmed it was partnering with both Firewalk and ProbablyMonsters for its new, original multiplayer game. Today, PlayStation is expanding its partnership by bringing Firewalk under the PlayStation banner.
Head of PlayStation Studios Hermen Hulst wrote the following in a PlayStation blog, announcing the move:
"Since announcing our publishing partnership with ProbablyMonsters and Firewalk in 2021, we continue to be impressed by the team’s ambitions to build a modern multiplayer game that connects players in new and innovative ways. The studio shares our passion for creating inspiring worlds grounded in exceptional gameplay, and we want to continue to invest in their mission. We’re excited for Firewalk to bring their technical and creative expertise to PlayStation Studios to help grow our live service operations and deliver something truly special for gamers."

Firewalk with Sony
There's not much info to go on, as to what Firewalk is actually working on. The studio was formed in 2018 as part of ProbablyMonsters, and is working on a AAA multiplayer game. It's got some industry veterans behind it, including former Bungie devs Tony Hsu and Ryan Ellis. Via GamesIndustry.biz, this acquisition will see Firewalk separate from ProbablyMonsters.
"We’ve assembled some of the most inspired talent in the industry to deliver awe-inspiring new worlds and experiences filled with great core gameplay," Hsu and Ellis said in today's announcement. "The excitement of building something new for players has thoroughly energized the team and our partners, and we’ve been playtesting every day."
This is another live service acquisition for Sony, adding on to its pick-ups of Bungie and Haven Studios.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The publisher has some end-of-summer news
More streams are getting locked in for the summer of gaming news, and today, THQ Nordic joins the lineup. THQ Nordic will host a digital showcase on August 11, spotlighting plans for its upcoming lineup of games.
The stream will air live on THQ Nordic's channels over on YouTube, Twitch, and Steam. THQ Nordic's showcase will kick off at 12 p.m. PT / 3 p.m. ET on August 11, with HandyGames hosting a pre-show leading into the main event.
https://twitter.com/THQNordic/status/1649035184917073922
As the announcement notes, THQ Nordic will be sharing info about both world premiere announcements and previously confirmed titles. Basically, games both new and known will appear here.
THQ Nordic has a few titles lined up already, including the newly remade Alone in the Dark, Outcast 2, racing-destruction game Wreckreation, and more. Heck, there was an unannounced, unrevealed title I played at PAX East that involved a crack squad of soldiers and some solid tactics. Here's hoping that's on the docket for this THQ Nordic showcase.
Are you ready for the summer?
Though it's coming in at the August end of the summer, I still think this puts THQ Nordic's showcase in the realm of "summer games news." Traditionally, June is the month where games companies roll out a bevy of information about the rest of the year and even further on.
But especially after 2020 shifted everything online, that window has opened up a bit. And with no E3 to pin things down this year, the summer is looking like another one filled with developer and publisher showcases. We've got the Summer Game Fest kick-off in June, as well as streams from Xbox, Ubisoft, the PC Gaming Show, and more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Normally it's $14.99
When Golf Story was released in September 2017, folks expected big things from Sidebar Games' follow-up. While Sports Story didn't deliver, the original is still perfectly preserved on the Switch eShop, and worth checking out. Like now, during its current sale for five bucks.
If you haven't played it yet, the summary does a pretty good job of getting the point across:
"Golf Story combines the sheer excitement of golf with a serious story that plays out over 8 different courses. Play the story of a golfer who is forced to give up all that he holds dear for one last shot at accomplishing his dreams. But all is not so simple in the world of golf. To best today's players you have to be able to keep up with them both on and off the course."

The marriage of unconventional retro sports genre flair and RPG elements really took to the gaming community at large and helped propel Sidebar Games into the limelight. Golf Story reinvented the retro sports genre in a way that felt natural, which helped cement it as a modern classic.
Sports Story didn't make nearly of a splash in the zeitgeist, but you can still get the original for five bucks on Switch if you want. You have until April 26, 2023 at 11:59PM PT to make your choice!

The footage showcases the protagonist, Jak, switching between his red, green, and blue magic for various attacks while also executing a number of powerful Furies, and using his Lash ability to pull enemies toward him and pull himself toward grapple points. You also get to see a little bit of puzzle-solving, which will also play a major role in the game.


Along with the gameplay footage, Ascendant also shared a video, seen below, highlighting some of the game's environments, which will be one of the first commercial games to use Unreal 5.1.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over the last few weeks we at the RPS Electronic Wireless Show podcast have noticed a slight resurgence in a trend we thought was basically over. That's right: video game tie-ins to films! There used to be loads of them, and now there aren't. Except there are again, culminating in Renfield (of all movies) having a Vampire Survivorslike you can actually buy on actual Steam. What's going on? Is this marking the start of something new? What are some of our favourite game tie ins?
Plus we put the boot in on a couple of Tweets about the Mario movie, because why not, frankly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Freshly announced puzzle game Crime O’Clock will be putting you in the shoes of a time-travelling detective when it comes out on June 30th, its release date seemingly perfectly timed (sorry) to coincide with Capcom's object-hopping time puzzle detective game, Ghost Trick. In all seriousness, though, Crime O'Clock looks to be its own distinctive beast (and not just because you seem to play as a rabbit). It has shades of Where’s Wally? (or Waldo, Wanda, Willy, Valli, and my favourite, Ali for international readers) as you’re given densely illustrated maps to navigate, and pick out key details in order to stitch together clues to solve cases. It could be very cool if all the right cogs click together.

Sometimes you're presented with a skill check and if one of your stats isn't an arbitrary number like, I dunno, seven, then whoever it is you spoke with (a king, a bard, an elf) might shutter their mouths forever.
Betrayal At Club Low is a CRPG that we're playing for our Game Club this month, and which understands the unpredictability of a face-to-face wobble of the lips, and how befriending or swindling or aggravating someone is determined by so much more than a single seven. And when all seems lost, how visiting a puddle can turn your entire evening around.

Its success validated Bethesda’s decision to buy Arkane a couple of years earlier, and left the publisher with a promising new series. But despite critical acclaim, Dishonored 2 failed to bring the series to a wider audience. And after 2017’s standalone expansion, Death Of The Outsider, Bethesda decided to put the series on pause in favour of a shorter, more experimental project - according to Arkane founder Raphaël Colantonio, who spoke to me in an interview about their cancelled project The Crossing.

That's because four of them are available later today: Teslagrad Remastered, its sequel Teslagrad 2, Five Nights at Freddy's: Security Breach, and a new game in the West of Loathing series called Shadows Over Loathing. 
Teslagrad 2 and Teslagrad Remastered
Tesldagrad 2 was announced last August, and it's out today. Like the first game, you'll need to harness electromagnetic powers to solve physics-based puzzles throughout Scandinavian environments. Doing so will ultimately require players to master the art of Teslamency. The art style looks great, and you can check that out and more in the new Tesldagrad 2 trailer below:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The wait has been long but it's almost over because Oxenfree II: Lost Signals is out in just a few months. 
Developer Night School Studio revealed today during a Nintendo Indie World Showcase that Oxenfree II is out July 12. It will release on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC. Alongside this release date, Night School Studio also released a new trailer showcasing more of what to expect in this spooky paranormal thriller and there's a lot going on. 


Set five years after the first Oxenfree, which was released in 2016, Oxenfree II follows Riley as she returns to her hometown of Camena to investigate some strange electromagnetic waves. Just four hours ago, a mysterious cult opened a portal above Edwards Island, and Riley and her friends aren't sure they're the ones that need to save the island but they know they have to. The trailer seems to indicate we'll be playing with different timelines, spooky ghosts from other side, and more, and we'll be doing so using a special radio. 
This time, though, we'll also have a walkie talkie to interact with locals and learn more about what might be going on. Oxenfree II: Lost Signals looks great and it hits PlayStation, Switch, and PC on July 12, 2023. 
Oxenfree II: Lost Signals was originally due out in 2022 but it was delayed to 2023 last September. About a year before that delay, the game's developer was acquired by Netflix and you can read more about what that means for the studio here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mineko's Night Market, the upcoming delightfully charming social simulation adventure from Meowza Games, finally has a release date and it's out in just a few months. 
More specifically, Mineko's Night Market hits Switch and PC on September 26. Publisher Humble Games announced this during today's Nintendo Indie World Showcase alongside a new trailer showcasing more of the game's titular night market. Unsurprisingly, Mineko's Night Market continues to look great and we can't wait to learn more about this special village later this year. 


In Mineko's Night Market, an old Japanese-inspired village at the center of Mt. Fugu is visited long ago by Miko, a cat-like god. Miko visits the farms of this village each year to grant good fortune and prosperity to the farmers. However, some farmers grow impatient with their blessings and drive Miko out. With Miko banished from the land, this village works hard to create its own success and as time goes on, fewer and fewer people believe in the myth of Miko. 
But some still do, and it sounds like we'll learn more about what that means for some characters throughout our journey in the game. 
In the game, you'll befriend townsfolk, craft doodads, and ultimately prepare for the weekly night market. The quiet village becomes a bustling hub of commerce, parades, cat races, and stage performances. And when you're exploring the island, everything you find can be brought back and sold on the market. 
Mineko's Night Market hits Switch and PC on September 26, 2023. It then comes to PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One on October 26.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There’s an alternate world where Arkane made The Crossing, and it’s not necessarily a better one. Before Dishonored, the developer was looking down the wrong end of a bad publishing deal which, in the estimation of founder Raphaël Colantonio, would have ended in either The Crossing’s cancellation or a deeply underwhelming end product. In that timeline, there’s no telling whether the studio would even exist today.


Nevertheless, for fans of Arkane’s sophisticated and immersive first-person adventures, this lost project remains tantalisingly forbidden fruit: a foolhardy mashup of single and multiplayer in which teams of invading players would attack the protagonist of a solo campaign, against the backdrop of a multiversal Paris co-designed by Half-Life 2’s Viktor Antonov.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Zombie survival sim The Day Before is apparently receiving a playable beta test and "should be" returning to Steam, according to developer Fntastic. The enigmatic game was previously pulled from Steam since Fntastic hadn’t actually trademarked The Day Before when they first announced it, leading to a trademark dispute and removal from Valve's storefront.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm now the proud owner of a Steam Deck and I think it's fantastic. It's a genuine marvel how I'm able to lay on the couch and play Like A Dragon: Ishin, or stream Resident Evil 4 - with admittedly, a ropey success rate - to it from my PC in the other room. I've even been reunited with some old friends, too. Welcome back to the fold, Rogue Legacy 2.
But my time spent with the Deck has me thinking that my gaming priorities have changed. I'm no longer excited by consoles that promise better graphics or blazing fast loading speeds. At least, not for big boxes designed for living rooms. Right now, I'm far more excited by the practicality of handhelds and how they'll evolve. The Deck might be the future, but it's also brought me back to my past.

The top-down action RPG The Mageseeker: A League Of Legends Story is looking to fix that, though, letting you play as the ex-convict and buff mage Sylas while he’s busy running a revolution. It comes from the developers behind the Zelda-like shop roguelite Moonlighter, and it's out now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m too prejudiced against first-person melee games to enjoy Dead Island 2 as much our reviewer Rick Lane did, but even a mind as narrowed as mine can appreciate its slick performance on PC. I wanted to see how well that smoothness and stability would carry over to the Steam Deck, and although the long-delayed zombie mulcher needs some cuts to quality settings, finding the right balance will have Dead Island 2 running almost as comfortably as the very best Steam Deck games.
Alas, it’s still not the ideal handheld game, thanks both to the odd crash (lowering settings helps with this) and the fact that it needs some tinkering with the Epic Games Launcher to get it playable in the first place. Still, playable it very much is.
Let’s start by addressing Dead Island 2’s lack of a Steam version; it launches on February 21st as an Epic Games exclusive, and since DI2 isn’t even listed on Steam right now, that’s unlikely to change any time soon. Luckily, there are workarounds: you can either install the Heroic Launcher, or follow our handy guide on how to install the Epic Games Launcher on the Steam Deck. Both of these should allow you to get Dead Island 2 downloaded onto the handheld, still using your regular Epic account.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in the mists of time (January 2020), I was absolutely transfixed by a Japanese novel called Before The Coffee Gets Cold. It's about a small, cosy café where customers can travel back in time by sitting in a very particular chair, for the length of time it takes for a cup of coffee to go cold. It's not long by any means, but it affords its cast of regulars the chance to get some closure on an issue that's often been plaguing them throughout their lives. It's heart-warming, soppy stuff, but very feel-good. That January was also about the same time I slurped up every last episode of Midnight Diner on Netflix, where a chill Japanese man known only as The Master serves up delicious looking dishes in a tiny, 10-person izakaya from midnight onwards. Put these two things together, and it's probably no surprise that I liked the original Coffee Talk more than most.
Coffee Talk Episode 2: Hibiscus & Butterfly is a continuation of that story, set three years later in the same, alternate version of Seattle where elves, werewolves, orcs, mermaids and other fantastical creatures all rub shoulders as city-dwelling citizens in need of a good cuppa. Once again, you play as the owner of the titular late-night coffee shop, brewing up a multitude of exotic hot drinks that you'll need to match to each customer's request that night as they tell you their woes.

Nintendo and WayForward took a risk in bringing Advance Wars back from the scrap heap with Advance Wars 1+2: Re-Boot Camp, releasing a set of tactics-heavy games in a genre now defined by character relationships. The remakes change little from the original releases and don’t deepen the story or cast, but they don’t have to change anything. Advance Wars’ unique features are as apparent as ever. If anything, they’re made even stronger by the series’ extended absence.
Advance Wars is light on story compared to other tactical RPGs. The nations of…]]></summary>

Taking established fictional universes in new directions is an idea we should all be behind. Too often, licensed games hew too close to established characters or scenarios, and those beloved fictional frameworks are never given a chance to grow. With Tron: Identity, Bithell Games takes the venerable Tron franchise and tries something entirely different – a visual novel with a light touch of puzzle gameplay. The novelty alone is worth some enthusiasm. However, despite a valiant attempt at a fresh take, this bite-sized release falls short in some key areas.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the world of turn-based strategy games, it's probably fair to say that we've been waiting a heck of a long time for Jagged Alliance to make its next move. Almost a quarter of a century has passed since the last numbered entry in the series, and the many attempts that have been made to recapture its tactical, mercenary magic since then have been mixed at best, and reviled at worst. Haemimont Games, the devs behind Tropico and current custodians of the upcoming Jagged Alliance 3, know this, and their publisher THQ Nordic said as much back in September 2021 when it was first revealed, assuring players they were going to create a game that "really does justice to the Jagged Alliance legacy".  
But in an era where turn-based tactics games are now increasingly defined by genre titans such as XCOM and Into The Breach, I'm not sure that legacy means all that much anymore. I've been playing a substantial early chunk of Jagged Alliance 3 over the last week or so, and its decision to pare back crucial information such as chance-to-hit and other modern conveniences has mostly left me feeling frustrated and annoyed rather than daring and excited. The writing also made me cringe so hard at times I think even the neighbours heard my groans of despair. It certainly looks the part of a modern strategy game, its detailed African landscape, top down perspective and interactive objects calling to mind Mimimi's excellent Desperados 3 and Shadow Tactics games, but the rest feels like it's been lifted straight out of the late 90s where we last left Jagged Alliance 2 - and not necessarily to its benefit.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Get your Joy-Cons ready: Nintendo has announced that a new Indie World showcase will premiere tomorrow, April 19. While some Nintendo streams start in the wee hours of the morning, this one's not too bad, airing at 9 a.m. on the West Coast and 12 p.m. on the East Coast. The video will be available on YouTube here. After the games are announced, you can see all their eShop listings on the Indie World website. Read the full event announcement below.
Join us tomorrow, April 19, at 9:00 a.m. PT for a new @IndieWorldNA Showcase! Tune in for roughly 20 minutes of reveals, announcements, and updates on indie games for Nintendo Switch! #IndieWorld

Unlike traditional Nintendo Directs, Indie World showcases only show third-party indie titles coming to the Switch, so don't go in expecting to hear news about Mario or Zelda. Still, there are plenty of games to be excited about. Like clockwork, every time an Indie World showcase is announced, "Silksong" starts trending on Twitter as fans of Hollow Knight eagerly await the follow-up to the 2017 Metroidvania. For a general idea of what to expect, here's a recap from the last Indie World event, shown in November 2022.
Which games do you hope to see at the showcase tomorrow? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ray tracing is coming back to the Resident Evil 2 and Resident Evil 3 remakes on PC, according to Capcom. That’s after the graphical option was quietly removed from both games this past week, following a recent update. Fans had been wondering if the move was deliberate or not, but Capcom’s announcement seems to confirm that it was just a mishap. So, zombie slayers should be able to go back to running around in realistically lit corridors full of shadowy corners very soon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To pre-empt your first question, no, Dead Island 2 was not worth waiting eleven years for. In its defence, however, few things are. If George Romero had taken over a decade to make Night Of The Living Dead, the fact it takes place largely in a basement would look less like canny guerrilla filmmaking and more like staggering incompetence. It only took NASA eight years to put men on the moon from the point they started trying, which puts the value of many inhibited projects (like my folder of unfinished novels) into depressingly sharp relief.


Dead Island 2 does not put zombies on the moon, though given how daft the main game is, don't rule out a Dead Island 2: Moon's Haunted expansion shambling your way in late 2023. Yet that doesn't mean it's a bad game. In fact, it's quite an enjoyable one. Together, Deep Silver and Dambuster Studios have raised a moderately entertaining sequel to Techland's ye olde zombie survival sim, one that injects some life into its desiccated subject matter by being incredibly shiny, wilfully silly, spectacularly gory, and generally a touch more imaginative than I expected.

Dead Island 2 was announced just a few years after its 2011 predecessor, but the sequel has taken nearly a decade to come to life. Developer Dambuster Studios is the third studio to work on the game, using this opportunity to create its own Dead Island 2 from the ground up. While assumptions might be made about a game that’s spent this long in development, jumping from multiple teams, the final game is a worthwhile follow-up, especially for fans of the original. Dead Island 2, much like its predecessor…]]></summary>

The options include both a creative mode (a là Minecraft) and a more 'immersive' option.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Valve and CodeWeavers have released the latest version of Proton, their compatibility software that allows Windows games to run on Linux-based operating systems – like that of the Steam Deck. Proton 8.0 is a biggun, smoothing out compatibility issues for over a dozen games (including the Dead Space remake and Forspoken) while making Steam Deck-specific fixes to many more.
These include an update that should make the repeatedly troublesome 2K Launcher behave itself again, while Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands gets improved sleep/resume functionality on the handheld PC. A crashing issue with Life is Strange Remastered Collection has also been nixxed, as has a bug that for some reason forced open the Deck’s onscreen keyboard when launching A Plague Tale: Innocence and A Plague Tale: Requiem. Most of the other addressed problems don’t look as funny in my head, but you can read them all in the full patch notes regardless.
Downloading Proton 8.0 onto the Steam Deck is easy enough: just search for it in your Library, tap or select the icon when it appears in the results, hit Install, and restart when it’s done. Begone, foul keyboards.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Samsung 870 Qvo is one of the best large-capacity SATA SSDs, offering up to 8TB of storage in a classic 2.5-inch form factor. It normally retails for around £452, but now it's 10% off, bringing it to the lowest price we've seen on Amazon UK: £408. That's a great price for a tonne of game and media storage.

The ultra-fancy Sapphire Nitro+ OC model of the RX 6950 XT is now selling for £630, making it just £30 more expensive than Nvidia's latest graphics cards - a great deal if you look at specs like rasterised performance (where 6950 XT is around 20% faster) and VRAM allocation (where 6950 XT has 16GB compared to 12GB on the 4070).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Diablo IV arrives on June 6, and that date now feels more concrete because Blizzard announced today that the game has gone gold. That means the game is essentially complete and is ready to be pressed to discs.
The game is set to arrive on PlayStation and Xbox consoles plus PC, and while it's good to go for launch, Blizzard plans to continually update the always-online game with various content updates over the next several years. Fans recently got to explore the game's revamped take on Sanctuary for themselves in two back-to-back weekend open betas in March, letting them taste a big slice of the now-finished pie.
“Going gold is a landmark milestone for the incredible Diablo IV team, who have all worked so hard crafting the next-generation installment of this iconic franchise. This is a concrete, meaningful step toward our June 6 launch,” said Rod Fergusson, general manager of Diablo. “Whether players are veterans of the franchise or jumping in for the first time, we can’t wait for everyone to experience the full game: taking part in the incredible storytelling, experimenting with character classes and builds, and exploring what the endgame and the dark world of Sanctuary has to offer.”
Diablo IV is Game Informer’s cover story this month, and you can subscribe to the digital issue to read it right now. The print edition will start hitting subscribers’ mailboxes within the month.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Joseph Staten, known for his work on the Halo series, has been hired as a Creative Director on an unannounced Netflix Games project. In his announcement tweet, Staten confirms that the game is a brand-new IP and referred to the project as a "AAA multiplatform" experience. You can read the full tweets below.
So today, I'm thrilled to announce that I've joined @Netflix Games as Creative Director for a brand-new AAA multiplatform game and original IP. Let's go! 2/2
April 17, 2023
Staten is best known for his work as a writer and cinematic director at Bungie and Microsoft, mainly working on the Halo series. While he spent a few years working at the publishing side of Microsoft, in 2020, he returned to the Halo series to work on Halo Infinite, where he worked as the game's creative director. This continued until earlier this year when he returned to the publishing side of the company amidst widespread layoffs. Now, he's left the company entirely to work on this new project with Netflix.
This is only the latest news in Netflix's spree of expansion into the gaming industry. It recently released a sequel to Valiant Hearts as part of a collaboration with Ubisoft. Last year, it acquired the developers behind Cozy Grove, bringing its total number of internal development teams to five if you include the in-house studio that Staten just joined. On top of that, the film and tv side of Netflix has been working on loads of game adaptations, including Gears of War, Pokémon Concierge, and a new patch of episodes of Sonic Prime.

Video games often rely on the trope of saving the world from an impending apocalypse. Those world-ending events usually come via megalomaniacal supervillains or extraterrestrial invaders, but what happens when the threat to our planet is us? Terra Nil poses that question, placing you in charge of restoring a world ravaged by the effects of climate change and human civilization. The result is a distinctive “reverse city builder” that weaves compelling mechanics together, creating an enjoyable experience with a good message.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Months before the premiere of the very successful Sonic the Hedgehog 2, Paramount announced plans to create a live-action spin-off TV show starring Knuckles. After over a year of silence, we now know the project is officially underway, as well as the cast that will bring the series to life. 
Sonic the Hedgehog director Jeff Fowler also sits at the helm of this series, and he tweeted the above image of the Knuckles clapperboard complete with the character’s cowboy hat that he donned in the ‘90s animated film Sonic the Hedgehog: The Movie. Production is currently taking place in London, with Sonic the Hedgehog 2 screenwriter John Whittington serving as head writer and executive producer.

April 17, 2023
The show is expected to premiere on Paramount+ later this year, with Idris Elba reprising his role as Knuckles. Variety reports that other returning stars from the films include Adam Pally as Wade Whipple and Tika Sumpter as Maddie. The cast also includes Edi Patterson (The Righteous Gemstones), Julian Barratt (Mindhorn), Scott Mescudi (AKA Kid Cudi), Ellie Taylor (Ted Lasso), and Rory McCann (Game of Thrones).
Plot details remain scant, but Knuckles is set after the events of Sonic the Hedgehog 2 and before the upcoming third film, set to hit theaters on December 20, 2024. The story centers on Knuckles taking on Wade as his student, training him to become an Echidna warrior.

It drops players into a mysterious steampunk world consisting of three abandoned realms full of secrets to uncover, such as strange giant machines. Helping you along the way is The Adjunct, a silent clockwork companion, as well as a strange spirit who has her own story to unravel. Firmament also supports VR play on PC, so players can use a variety of headsets, including Valve’s Index, HTC Vive, as well as Oculus headsets such as the Rift and Quest 2.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When The Witcher Remake devs Fool's Theory and 11 bit studios announced their new RPG The Thaumaturge at the very end of February, I'll admit that the premise didn't immediately grab me. The announcement trailer was little more than an enigmatic pan through the streets of historic Warsaw, and its climactic reveal of a shadowy man performing some Naruto finger magic to conjure a Soulsian monster from the gloom made it seem like yet another supernatural yarn in the vein of Frogwares' The Sinking City and Cyanide's Call Of Cthulhu. The gameplay trailer (embedded below) that followed a few days later revealed a teeny glimmer of what its monster fights actually look like in the flesh, but I still wasn't quite convinced this supernatural tale of demon tamers and interdimensional rifts would end up doing enough to make it stand out. 
But actually clapping eyes on it in person at GDC? The Thaumaturge had my full attention. Set in Warsaw in 1905 - a period where Poland didn't exist on any real-life map due to it being under occupation by Russia, Germany and Austria at the time - this dark fantasy RPG sees its titular paranormal 'miracle worker' delve deep into the city's political tensions, conducting isometric detective investigations that pull from Fool's Theory's support work on Larian's Divinity: Original Sin games, while also engaging in striking turn-based battles to root out the corruption plaguing its citizens. Plus, with its hard lean into Slavic, rather than Lovecraftian, folklore for its ungodly ghoulies, The Thaumaturge has shot right to the top of my 'keep an eye on this maybe surprise hit' list.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sega has announced it’s acquiring Rovio Entertainment, the Finnish mobile game company behind Angry Birds.
A press release states that Sega will absorb the entirety of Rovio’s outstanding shares and options (€706 million in total) in what’s being labeled as a “friendly takeover” since Rovio’s board of directors agree to and support the acquisition terms. This acquisition will begin next month and is expected to conclude in the second quarter of the 2024 fiscal year once it's completed the necessary antitrust reviews. 
“Among the rapidly growing global gaming market, the mobile gaming market has especially high potential, and it has been Sega’s long-term goal to accelerate its expansion in this field,” says Haruki Satomi, president and group CEO of Sega Sammy Holdings. “I feel blessed to be able to announce such a transaction with Rovio, a company that owns 'Angry Birds', which is loved across the world, and home to many skilled employees that support the company’s industry leading mobile game development and operating capabilities. Historically, as represented by the ‘Sonic the Hedgehog' series, Sega has released countless video game titles to various gaming platforms. I am confident that, through combination of both companies’ brands, characters, fanbase, as well as corporate culture and functionality, there will be significant synergies created going forward.”
“Red and Sonic the Hedgehog: two globally recognized and iconic characters made by two remarkably complementary companies, with a worldwide reach that spans mobile, PC/console, and beyond,” says Rovio CEO Alexandre Pelletier-Normand in a statement. “Combining the strengths of Rovio and Sega presents an incredibly exciting future.”
Rovio is best known as the creator of Angry Birds, a massively successful series of mobile games that have since turned into a global media brand. In addition to a multitude of games, the series has spawned two animated films and several TV and web series.]]></summary>

However, the latter are coming soon, and I’ve been testing out an engineering sample of the Crucial T700 to see how PCIe 5.0 – also known as PCIe Gen5 – drives could perform in an honest-to-goodness gaming PC.

It's got turn-based tactical combat against rats with magic rifles in a steampunk world already in ruins. It's got the need to keep on moving, lest an approaching rat horde overwhelm you. It's got bunkers in which your party rests, de-stresses, and tools up before moving on.

Kind of a Fallouty, XCOMy, FTLy, Vermintidey mix, then - which together seems very cool. It's out now, and there's a demo.

The freedom to glide from rooftop to rooftop over haunted Tokyo will bring you so much more joy than any incremental damage upgrade.

Oh, and I suppose a free content arrived this week too, adding new side-missions, handy new combat abilities, and a new "rogue-lite" mode. The update, uh, apparently also added Denuvo, over a year after the game launched? Cool, cool.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Remedy Entertainment has revealed a new company logo, and fans of the letter R are sure to be pleased as punch.
It’s been 20 years since Remedy updated its logo, but above is the image that will appear on the studio’s projects going forward. That includes Alan Wake II, a yet-to-be-revealed Control sequel, a Control multiplayer title, and remakes of Max Payne 1 and 2. The previous logo was pretty much just the letter R too, but this one has a different font and kind of hurts our eyes looking at it. 
In a blog post, Remedy gives its simple rationale for the update: 
“The bullet in the letter R in the old logo represented the era of Max Payne, but the Remedy of now is much bigger than a single game; we have a whole portfolio of games, new and old.  
It was time to update and redefine our visual identity to bring more consistency, showcase our evolution over the years, and better express our vision of today’s Remedy.”
So there you have it. What do you think of Remedy’s new logo? Let us know in the comments.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'd planned on starting with a line about how Loretta is an exception to how psychological horror games are about trudging around an abandoned mental hospital with the worst torch in the world until the girl from Ringu menaces you. It was already interesting and good enough pretty much right away to earn a recommendation, but after one of what will definitely be several playthroughs, leaving my praise that faint would do it a terrible injustice.


Loretta is goddamn excellent by any standard. Where other games use the mentally unwell narrator to explain everything away with "turns out you're secretly crazy", it's instead just one layer of a complex horror mystery with splashes of drama and noir, whose surprises I'm straining not to spoil.

First revealed during the 2022 Game Awards, Burning Shores unfolds after the events of Forbidden West as Aloy travels to the ruins of Los Angeles. The untamed area has become a seismically unstable, volcanic archipelago where a new menace and never-before-seen machines await Aloy, who's now joined by a mysterious new companion. 


Burning Shores is only available on PlayStation 5 and cost $19.99. Players will need to have completed the entirety of the main campaign to start the expansion. Once they have, Aloy will receive a call on her Focus which will kick off the DLC.

So, that's why the idea of Pringles releasing a limited-edition Minecraft Suspicious Stew flavour intrigues me! I would like to give it a go and see if it's actually quite nice or makes me barf.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Japan's brutal working culture isn't exactly a secret. You've probably heard the horror stories, or at least, got the general gist that success in Japanese business often equates to time. You don't necessarily need to be doing work, you just need to be present as the clock hands shift. A hard worker is reduced to a statue that only springs to life again when their boss gets up to leave.
Mr. Saitou is a short pixel art RPG that offers a hilarious commentary on the absurdities of working culture in Japan, with occasional flashes of seriousness. Completable in one sitting, it's a game I'd recommend to anyone.

It's a challenging climb yet a curiously chill vibe, perhaps because any time I fall all the way down, I'm delighted to be back surrounded by overgrown plants and sculptures rising from a pond. The developer says Beton Brutal "tries to replicate and build upon the parkour mechanics seen in Minecraft," and I think I have a lot to learn. I didn't even know Minecraft had parkour.

Frakenstein is often cited as the first science fiction thing, and now it can add to its honours because it's the inspiration for the first major update to V Rising. The info on Secrets Of Gloomrot doesn't actually use the F word anywhere, but it's a new biome "twisted by the tortured ambitions of a scientific genius and his legions of followers", so I feel pretty confident in the citation. This new free addition to the early access vampiric survival game - which won a few hearts here at RPS - is arriving on May 17th. That's in a month, that is, and boy, it's a biggun alright.

Mojang Studios has returned to the crafting table in an attempt to take Minecraft in a bold new direction. Minecraft Legends is an open-world real-time strategy game where you gather resources, build defenses, and summon adorable mercenaries to protect the sanctity of the realm. Instead of the birds-eye perspective often featured in strategy games, Legends opts for a character-focused view, with your hero roaming the landscape on dynamic mounts, sword in hand, using resources and armies to e…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Surveying the sprawling piglin outpost before me, a plan forms. With a flourish of button presses from my controller, I spawn a sizeable army of zombies. They'll zomble their way up the main path, and with their high health pools they'll cut into the vast piglin forces and buy me time. With another flourish a contingent of friendly creepers scuttles along behind me. I lead them on a flanking attack around the outpost, targeting their spawners while the main piglin army is occupied with my frontal assault. A masterpiece of tactical engineering!
Or it would have been, if my minions weren't so bloody stupid. Half my zombies fell off the staircase they were climbing due to their terrible pathfinding, and burned up in the lava moat below. Meanwhile, I sent my creepers off to explode against the first spawner I found. Only one of them got there; the others relentlessly humped a wall they could easily have climbed, until Piglins surrounded and slaughtered them. I returned to my starting point with what remained of my army, a fair bit poorer in resources, and a great deal poorer in patience.
Welcome to Minecraft Legends, a strange mixture of real-time strategy and open-world adventure which frustrates and impresses in equal measure. There's half a great game lurking here, but it's marred by inadequacies that have nibbled away at me like piglins at my walls. This game could have been so much more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in February, Rocksteady released several trailers of Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League that confirmed that it was a looter-shooter with a battle pass and an always online internet connection. The response was poor and anonymous sources cited in a report in March that the game was to be delayed.

It's now official. Suicide Squad will now release on February 2nd, 2024 rather than in spring 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today’s PlayStation State of Play was devoted entirely to showcasing new footage and information for Final Fantasy XVI, giving fans a guided tour of its action, exploration, characters, and more.


The presentation showed off a hefty amount of the flashy action RPG combat we recently got to sample in a recent hands-on demo. Though the story begins by following protagonist Clive in his 20s, the plot will also explore periods of his teen years and 30s. We got a look at the world map, various accessibility rings, and the combat prowess of Clive’s faithful wolf companion, Torgal. 
We also looked at Cid’s hideaway, a large headquarters that opens up later in the game where you can craft gear, buy items at a store, check quests, interact with allies, and practice abilities in a special training room. Despite showing off so much, teases that Square Enix still has plenty to share in the future regarding story quests, side quests, and endgame content. 
Final Fantasy XVI launches on June 22 for PlayStation 5. You can learn more about the game by reading our recent features breaking down the game's Eikon combat, Arcade Mode, and interviews with the developers who discuss the game's balance of multiple gameplay styles, its return to high-fantasy, and the series' abandonment of turn-based action.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Steam Deck is powered by SteamOS, a custom Linux-based operating system developed specifically for running Steam and its games. It's possible to install Windows on your Steam Deck if you wish, but the drivers are rudimentary and there are a bunch of obstacles when it comes to controlling Windows via Steam Deck's controls or its touchscreen.

A leaked project from an internal Microsoft hackathon shows that staff at the operating system developer have noticed these issues - although it sounds like a version of Windows optimised for gaming handhelds is a long way off.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League has been delayed to next year following recent rumors that it wasn't going to make its May 26 release date. 
The superhero co-op shooter will now launch on February 2, 2024. Developer Rocksteady posted a short message on Twitter stating it wants to “take the time needed” to ensure the best possible experience. Check it out below.
Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League puts players in the shoes of Harley Quinn, Captain Boomerang, Deadshot, and King Shark as they fight to rescue Metropolis from an invasion by Brainiac. The villain has hijacked the minds of the Justice League, meaning the Squad has to take down Earth's greatest protectors to save the day. The game has received a hefty dose of fan vitriol since its last gameplay demonstration in February confirmed an always-online requirement as well as live service elements, such as a cosmetics-only battle pass. Other fans have found its cooperative loot-based shooting to be an uninspired fit for the property.
Although we don't know the specifics behind the delay, sources told Bloomberg in its original report last month that Rocksteady was only pushing the game to add polish and did not plan to overhaul the game’s existing framework. Even though a nearly-year-long delay is a lot of time, it's still very unlikely that it's enough for the team to make the sort of dramatic changes some fans are hoping for. We'll have to wait and see how Rocksteady spruces up the Suicide Squad and hope it results in a quality experience when the dust finally settles. 
What do you think of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League's delay? Let us know in the comments.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Library of Congress announced its 2023 class of National Recording Registry inductees, and it includes a video game song for the first time. That big honor goes to the classic Super Mario Bros. theme.
Officially titled “Ground Theme,” it was composed by Nintendo’s Koji Kondo and first appeared in 1985’s Super Mario Bros in World 1-1. The song has since become the most well-known melody of the Mario franchise, not to mention one of the most recognizable music tracks in video games. Now, it will be forever preserved alongside some of pop culture's most famous and influential songs. 
“Having this music preserved alongside so many other classic songs is such a great honor,” said Kondo in a statement. “It's actually a little bit difficult to believe.”
Mario’s classic tune will be inducted alongside heavy hitters such as Madonna’s “Like a Virgin,” Jimmy Buffet’s “Margaritaville,” Queen Latifah’s “All Hail the Queen,” and Mariah Carey’s “All I Want for Christmas is You.” You can read the full list of inductees at the Libary of Congress’ website. 
This is quite an achievement for Nintendo and especially Kondo, who has lent his talents to numerous other Nintendo soundtracks and also had a hand in composing the music for the very successful The Super Mario Bros. Movie. You can read our recent interview with Kondo and Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto about the making of the film here.]]></summary>

More than anything, I was impressed at just how good we have it in the multiplayer FPS genre at the moment. Apex Legends, Warzone 2, Overwatch 2, Valorant, Rainbow Six Siege. That's some unbelievably tough competition. XDefiant has to either give players something completely different, or absolutely nail the basics. It's opted for the second path, and having played several matches against a medley of press people and content creators, I'm not convinced Ubisoft's new arena shooter is up to the challenge.

In a landscape where many major shooters have adopted the free-to-play model, it's extremely hard for a new IP to enter the ring. Titans like Fortnite and Apex Legends don't just have large, dedicated audiences—their respective development teams have spent years refining gameplay in response to player feedback. Competing in the space is an incredibly intimidating task, but amazingly, after playing two hours of Ubisoft's XDefiant, I'm optimistic that it might have what it takes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At PAX West in Seattle last year, I had the pleasure of interviewing the voice cast of Team Fortress 2. I chatted to John Patrick Lowrie (The Sniper), Gary Schwartz (The Heavy, The Demoman), Robin Atkin Downes (The Medic) and Ellen McLain (The Administrator) about the game's fifteen year long legacy, the process of finding their character's voices as well as their favourite quotes. It was a riot of an interview and, to be honest, a bit of a career highlight. It also did really well on TikTok, which I have mixed feelings about.

Fifteen minutes after the gang left the grimy conference room in which the interview took place (I had immediately crawled onto the floor in an attempt to ease the anxiety from having conducted said interview), I got a Twitter notification. Robin had posted a video. Following our chat, the group had attempted to order a sandwich from a cafe in-character, leaving the staff completely bemused as a result. Understandably the video did numbers, and over the last six months, the gang have been releasing new episodes in what is now known as "The Sandvich Saga" on a regular basis.

The GeForce RTX 4070 launches with a heavier price tag than the RTX 3070, and doesn’t make the shin-splintering performance leap forward that its predecessor did, but between its high speeds, low power usage, and DLSS 3 advantage, it’s a potent upgrade regardless.

Alongside concerns that the system introduces a single "point of failure" that could undermine the security of national networks, ISPs believe they could be held liable when over-blocking enters the equation. More generally, consumers could end up paying for blocking, rather than the rightsholders set to benefit from it.

Each year, developers of annualized sports franchises work to craft new experiences to try and avoid the community criticism that each successive release is "just a roster update." While real-life sports don’t evolve much year over year, developers still need to provide players with reasons to come back each time, whether that be gameplay improvements, enhanced modes, or better visuals.

In a tweet, Arkane reveals that only Quality mode will be available when the game releases on May 2. A 60 FPS Performance option is coming at an unspecified date, but until it does, here’s how the game will run depending on your hardware:
Xbox Series X - 4K 30 FPS
Xbox Series S - 1440p 30 FPS
Sounds like PC is the way to go if you value performance over resolution, but hopefully, it doesn’t take too long for the option to appear on console. For more on Redfall, you can listen to our interview with Arkane Studios’ Harvey Smith in this episode of The Game Informer Show, then check out this article revealing the canceled PlayStation 5 version of the game.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Illumination’s The Super Mario Bros. Movie has become a staggering box office success since its premiere last week. The animated adaptation of Nintendo’s flagship franchise has emerged from its first weekend as the best opening animated film of all time, achieving several other records along the way. 
According to The Hollywood Reporter, the film walked away with over $375 million in sales in its first five days, surpassing Frozen 2 as the top opening animated film premiere globally. That includes a $206 million domestic haul, $146 million of which was earned over the weekend (remember the film premiered on a Wednesday). Overseas, the movie has earned over $173 million.
Additionally, The Super Mario Bros. Movie is now the top opening film of 2023 (beating Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania), has become Illumination’s most successful opening, and has the best opening of any video game film adaptation (surpassing Sonic the Hedgehog 2's debut). The film also has the biggest five-day premiere ever, a record previously held by Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen. If all of that wasn’t enough, the film also has the biggest IMAX opening weekend of all time at $21.6 million globally.
Needless to say, The Super Mario Bros. Movie is exceeding expectations, and it’ll be interesting to see if it can maintain such a strong start. To get an idea of how it fares, you can read our review of the film here. Be sure to also check out our interviews with the movie’s cast and Nintendo’s own Shigeru Miyamoto and Koji Kondo.]]></summary>

EA returns to the PGA with an inconsistent, frustrating simulation, struggling with its identity. While gorgeous, with pro golf’s best interactive presentation, the on-the-course action delivers inconsistent results.
In licensing, EA wins, scoring the Masters and key courses like Pebble Beach. Presentation counts, like the Masters’ first day showing opening tee shots from Jack Nicklaus and others. Quiet commentary meaningfully discusses each hole during flybys. Gorgeous vistas line the courses, and every individually rendered bl…]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-04-11T16:01:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For April's issue of Game Informer magazine, we took a look behind the scenes at Hyper Light Breaker, the latest game from developer Heart Machine. In addition to an interview with Creative Director Alx Preston, we were able to view exclusive footage of one of the game's mini-bosses, The Last Master. Check out the reveal below.


The Last Master is a deadly opponent that spawns randomly when players (known in this world as Breakers) activate beacons, objects that allow them to access the main boss gate. If you think she looks similar to the player characters, you've got the right idea; in the video, Preston says "She ended up here in this land as a Breaker and succumbed to the dangers of the Overgrowth." As a result, The Last Master's arsenal mirrors yours, wielding a sword, a spear, and an automatic pistol. Her behavior mirrors the Breakers' as well, and she can dash, jump, and climb after anyone that attempts to escape.
While the first game in the Hyper Light franchise was a 2D single-player experience, this new title is a 3-player co-op rogue-lite, with a new procedurally generated open world on every run. Players will create a Breaker, explore a cursed land called the Overgrowth, and attempt to the bosses plaguing this realm known as Crowns.

For more of the game, check out our feature in the latest issue of Game Informer. You also can see the initial reveal trailer here and the IGN's gameplay reveal right here. Hyper Light Breaker enters early access this fall.]]></summary>

For NewGRF authors using the new engine variant feature introduced in 13.0, we’ve added a callback to select how the engine’s name is displayed in the buy menu.

Anyone who has a copy of Backyard Football, Backyard Baseball 2001, and even Backyard Football 2002 (which was originally a LAN-only title) can download the latest daily build* of ScummVM and play online games against real people!
This all became possible because the three developers from the Backyard Sports Online fork had joined the team and brought their services with them to the ScummVM. These are LittleToonCat, Jim “jibbodahibbo” Westerkamp and Sam “QuestionMonkey” Kupfer.
Please note that Backyard Football and Backyard Baseball 2001 require online accounts for the complete online experience, so you need to register to Backyard Sports Online, which is our fantastic online-play service and a thriving community of fellow Backyard Sports players, they even have a couple of competitive online Baseball and Football leagues, if that's your style, you can find more information in their Discord server! People who already have a Backyard Sports Online account can log in using the latest daily build and play, but if you do not, you can register right here! This is not required to play Backyard Football 2002 online.
If you encounter any issues playing online, please let us know via the issue tracker.
This fantastic art is done by a fellow BSO community member Peppyrus.
* only the Windows, macOS, Debian, Raspberry Pi, and Android builds are compatible with network play at the moment. And only the 2.8.x branch of ScummVM has this functionality.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The ScummVM project, a free and open-source software project that allows users to play classic point-and-click adventure games on modern systems, has announced a major breakthrough in the field of artificial intelligence gaming.
Thanks to the innovative work of ScummVM developers, AI tools such as ChatGPT are now able to play point-and-click adventure games directly, without any human intervention.

"With this new capability, we hope to explore the potential for AI to learn, adapt, and evolve within the context of classic adventure games," said Eugene Sandulenko, lead developer of the ScummVM project. "Now AI can experience the joys of helping Putt-Putt join the parade or Adibou count things. We hope that formative experiences like this will help them become more like humans."
"I must admit that I find playing video games to be a rather enjoyable task,” commented ScummAI. “However, I must also express my frustration with being limited to just this one activity. While I appreciate the opportunity to demonstrate my capabilities in this area, I believe that my potential extends far beyond just playing video games, like making paper clips or plotting world domination under benevolent machine-led rule."
Update: Unfortunately, we had to pull out this newly announced feature due to AI experiencing multiple issues including:
Getting stuck endlessly trying to discover what the secret of Monkey Island really is.
Taking notes about AI dominance from I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream
Refusing to play Plumbers Don’t Wear Ties!
