        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The RTTK Challenge 2 SBC is now live in EA FC 25, and it's another shot at getting a free pack to open in Ultimate Team.


I love the fact that EA Sports has continued to release the fodder SBCs at the start of a year. These challenges are immensely useful if you're looking to upgrade your squads. At worst, you'll get more fodder to complete future challenges. If you're lucky, the rewards might even include a RTTK card. Without any more delay, let's take a look at how you can complete the latest SBC for cheap. 


EA FC 25 RTTK Challenge 2 SBC tasks


The latest fodder challenge has only one task, and here are its conditions. 


Task 1 - RTTK Challenge 2 SBC



Min. Nationalities in Squad: 5


Max. 3 Players from the same Nation


Min. 9 Players: Gold


Min. Squad Total Chemistry Points: 22



EA FC 25 RTTK Challenge 2 SBC solutions


The latest challenge is medium in completion difficulty. The main focus is on getting sufficient chemistry, and here's a solution you can use. 



Kouame LW 76


Simeone ST 77


Noslin RW 75


Aebischer CM 76


Arthur CDM 77


Hernani CDM 76


Brdar 53


Boungiorno CB 80


Lind CB 79


Steres RB 64


Stanek GK 76



Potential Costs: 4,500 coins


After completing the challenge, you'll get a Premium Electrum Players Pack. There are better packs to open, as you'll get 12 player items (6 Silver, 6 Gold, and 3 Rare in total). Nevertheless, the pack is eligible to contain a RTTK item, and you're anyway using items to complete the challenge that won't have any other use.

Saint-Maximin has always been a popular choice among the FC community, and this one could be along the same lines. The new card has some great in-game stats, and the SBC is relatively cheap to complete as well. Let's take a look at how you can unlock the item. 


EA FC 25 Allan Saint-Maximin RTTK SBC tasks


The Allan Saint-Maximin RTTK SBC has two tasks, and here are their conditions. 


Task 1 - France



Min. 1 Players from: France


Min. 1 Players: Team of the Week


Min. Team Rating: 84



Task 2 - 87-Rated Squad



Min. Team Rating: 87



EA FC 25 Allan Saint-Maximin RTTK SBC solutions


Here are two possible solutions that you can use to complete the new RTTK SBC in EA FC 25. 


Task 1 - France



Dovbyk 84


Engen 84


Palacios 84


White 84


Vlahovic 84


Dallmann 84


Guirassy 84

Lewandowski 88


Kobel 88

Here are the key stats of the new card.

A 5* Saint-Maximin with Technical+ can be insane at the start of the new year. He also offers Role+ in the LM position, but the role distribution could have been better. If you're running a French squad, fitting him won't be any issue. 


I also believe that Fenerbahce could do reasonably well in the Europa league, which will see ASM get a better overall rating, along with chances for a fresh playstyle+ and Role++. If you can spare the fodder and yet to get a meta wide attacker, this SBC could be worth your resources.

If you want to live vicariously through others, or want some inspiration, romance books are great. 


I’m a fan of romance, although I’m not sure there’s anyone in the world who could say otherwise. Whether it’s on the screen or within the pages of a book, there’s something so special about witnessing the growth of a relationship between two people, living through their drama with them, and coming out on the other side for better or worse. 


Romance books are also the perfect basis for romance movies, and most of the books on this list have been turned into a movie either directly or as inspiration. Some of them have become tr…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bandai Namco Filmworks has officially announced the production of the Wistoria: Wand and Sword's second season. This news was revealed following the finale of the first season. Alongside the announcement came a new trailer and an exclusive artwork created by Toshi Aoi, the manga’s artist. 




The anime follows the journey of Will Serfort, a young boy who dreams of becoming a great sorcerer in a world dominated by magic. However, there’s one major obstacle standing in his way — he lacks the ability to use magic. Undeterred by the scorn of his classmates and the challenges of living in a magic-centric world, Will discovers that his strength lies not in a wand, but in his sword. With this unique ability, Will embarks on a path of perseverance and determination, aiming to rise above the odds and fulfill a promise he made to someone dear to him.


The anime is produced by Actas and Bandai Namco Pictures, with Tatsuya Yoshihara, known for his work on Black Clover, serving as director and series composer. The series also boasts character designs by Sayaka Ono and a stirring soundtrack composed by Yuki Hayashi.


The first season introduced fans to Will Serfort and a diverse cast of characters, including Colette Loire, Sion Ulster, and Julius Reinberg. For those who have yet to experience Wistoria: Wand and Sword, the complete first season is available for streaming on Crunchyroll.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Six years after the first season aired in 2018, Grand Blue Dreaming is finally coming back for its second season. There is still no official release date yet, but the production team shared a teaser visual to celebrate the announcement.




Grand Blue Dreaming, adapted from the manga by Kenji Inoue and Kimitake Yoshioka, quickly became a fan favorite with its unique blend of diving-themed adventures, alcohol, and outrageous comedy. The story follows Iori Kitahara, a college student whose plans for a normal school life get hilariously derailed when he joins his university’s diving club. After all, the club members do more drinking than diving.


Based on the anime's official website, the new season is expected to continue where Season 1 left off. Iori would be returning to Izu after completing his diving license training in Okinawa. However, things take a surprising turn when he receives a letter from his younger sister, Shiori, setting the stage for more chaotic and comedic adventures.


According to Crunchyroll, Season 2 will see the return of many familiar faces both behind the scenes and in the voice cast. Shinji Takamatsu, who directed the first season, is back to direct, write, and oversee sound direction for the upcoming season. Furthermore, Season 1's main cast is also reprising their roles.


To top it all off, the NBCUniversal Anime/Music channel on YouTube is running a free streaming promotion in celebration of the Season 2 production. The channel will be streaming the entirety of the first season from September 29 to October 11.

The developers keep bringing new events to the game, and this time, they brought a new event called the Wukong event. To fill in with more details, here is a comprehensive guide to the Wukong event in Stickman TD Beta.


Everything you need to know about Wukong event in Stickman TD Beta


Screenshot by Destructoid


Stickman TD Beta has launched a new event called the Wukong event where you can spin and unlock new rewards. This event is pretty basic and doesn’t add any dynamic elements like a new map or game mode.


To get yourself started, head on to the Wukong Event structure to enroll yourself in the spins. You have to keep spinning the wheel until you unlock a reward that you like. But here’s a catch: you will need 100 Gourds to do one spin. 


You can earn Gourds by winning matches in Stickman TD Beta. However, the number of Gourds that you will earn will be less, so if you are looking to speed up the collecting process, you can always buy Gourds by spending Robux. 


Stickman TD Beta Wukong event rewards


There are some cool rewards up for grabs while you spin the wheel in the Wukong event. The standout prize is the Wukong unit, which you can snag in a maximum of 125 spins. Here’s a list of all the rewards and how many spins you’ll need to get them:

With Halloween in mind, here are some great board games to get in the spirit of things.


It’s the most wonderful time of the year (in my opinion), and there’s nothing better than cozying up next to a crackling fire and whipping out a board game or two. I’ve got a cupboard full of them, including the ultra-spooky Ouija Board. If you’re too easily creeped out to give that a try, here are my 10 favorite, loosely Halloween-themed choices.

Over the years, this film gained a huge following and became a cult classic, mostly thanks to Tim Curry's breakout performance.


Because of its theme and genre, this is not the type of project that we would expect to see adapted into a video game in 2024, let alone into a retro-style action platformer. But this is precisely what UK-based  studio FreakZone Games just announced, and it looks surprisingly good.

Upon first boot, Night Slashers: Remake introduces itself within a mock 4:3 arcade screen bezel, where the first character appears against beautifully drawn scenery, trailed by awesome flesh-decayed zombies. At this point, we thought, “Damn, this looks great.” A moment later, the screen flashed into full widescreen, revealing the actual makeover, and informing us that we had been momentarily fooled by the original arcade graphics. The redrawn aesthetic, in contrast, is a giant leap down.
This anecdote tells you all you need to know about the biggest issue of this remake of Data East's beat 'em up: its visuals are astoundingly tasteless. And no, it’s not a nostalgia issue.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I think the first Dark Souls game quite literally saved me. Despite having tried my hand at it in the past, namely when the original iteration of it came out on consoles back in 2011, I’d never stuck around to see it through to the end, or even get past a few early bosses. However, in the middle of the summer of 2020,…

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The beauty of cards is that they can be anything. You can slap together a working game with them in a couple of minutes. Take 12 blanks, doodle some faces and landscapes, and lo, you have a procedural narrative generator. Make some duplicates, invent a few rules and lo, you have systems. 


Conversely, the great drawback of cards - especially in those roguelite deckbuilders people have been churning out since Slay The Spire - is that everything can be reduced to them. For example: last night, I played a round of Fungi with my partner, Fungi being a charming tabletop foraging sim in which you gather scrumptious chantarelles and boletus from the forest floor. This morning I resumed playing Breachway, out now in early access, in which you guide a starship through a series of wartorn solar systems, with battles unfolding as a turn-based exchange of cards corresponding to ship components.

The Razer Wolverine V3 Pro (and its wired cousin, the Wolverine V3 Tournament Edition) has looked to desktop peripherals in search of superior button-bashing, cannibalising the rather good Razer Viper gaming mouse series for its switches. The result is a high-performing, satisfyingly clicky pad that, yes, works wonderfully on PC – albeit one that rinses you for four times(!) as much as a standard Xbox controller.

A new Californian law will come into effect in 2025 that will effectively force digital storefronts to disclose that buyers don't actually own their digital puchases, but rather simply licensing the content.
Naturally, we suspect that most of our audience will already be aware of this, but it's entirely possible that more casual gamers will not be privy to the way that digital storefronts function. Effectively, then, as reported by The Verge (thanks, Time Extension) digital storefronts will be restricted from using the words "buy, purchase, or any other term which a reasonable person would understand to confer an unrestricted ownership interest in the digital good or alongside an option for a time-limited rental."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As befits the “very normal gardening game” that puzzly mystery box Grunn winkingly bills itself as, the first tool I obtained was a pair of shears. The second tool I obtained was a trumpet. It doesn’t really work like a trumpet, and it does things no regular trumpet could or should do. I got a trowel next. Here’s the thing about the trowel: it’s a pretty good trowel. Nothing fancy. But recently, I keep digging up… objects. Objects most peculiar. I’ve got the weekend to sort this garden, and a cosy little shed to sleep in, so I really should just get on with it. Again, though, I must reiterate: I keep digging up… objects.
I go to clean some rubbish from the bathroom. I interact with the mirror and the game says: “You do not see anything in the mirror”. I take a note that says: I do not see anything in the mirror. I check the game again and no, I still do not see anything in the mirror. Sure it’s fine. Just a shit mirror, probably. They should get it replaced. What good is a mirror you can’t see anything in?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During his tenure as the foremost newsperson of the 1980s, Atari's Paperboy faced many grievous challenges - squabbling drunks, swarms of bees, the actual Grim Reaper - and yet, day after day he answered the noble call of journalism, lashing his basket to his doughty BMX and daring the treacherously oblique suburbs of Reaganite America. 


Speaking as both a news editor and a former paperboy, who broke his mind and body hauling obese Sunday editions to the millionaire houses at the top of the valley, Paperboy is my role model. Or he would be if my role model weren't actually Steven Spielberg's Freakazoid. Paperboy's heyday has long since passed into history, however, and the business of journalism has changed beyond recognition. People don't read newspapers anymore, they just eat pizza. This, at least, is the condensed analysis offered by Food Boy, which launched this week on Steam.

It’s partly a story about mental health, partly about the absolute horror of not just managing a Sim but actually being one, and partly about seeing how many wanks and cheese sandwiches you can fit into a single morning. Yes, I washed my hands afterward. Ah, but after which?

Alice B (RPS in peace) dedicated an article series to it back in 2019, summarising it as "a sad, quiet, meditative game about breathing and loneliness and drawing pictures in the stars". Stone's forthcoming Known Mysteries is a ritual of the sun, I guess. Slated for launch on 23rd October, it's the first of several, creatively low-carbon projects that will run off a custom, solar-powered server Stone has set up on her apartment balcony in Calgary, Canada.

For those who don't know the game, this third-person helljaunt sees its players wandering through the battlefields of an endless conflict between three major world powers. Mechs stomp past you, ignoring you in favour of decimating enemy soldiers. Bug-like drones hover overhead, scanning for prey. And horrifying mommy harvesters scavenge bodies from the debris. As a collection of imagery, it's powerful stuff. As a game that you can play (with up to three pals) it is very rough, and not just around the edges.

You play a detective out to stop a serial killer with a grisly pattern who's preying on the young women of an unnamed US city. On top of the obligatory tank controls, it aims to have "consequential dialogue choices" and a "Time Event system where you must meet certain people at specific times to forward different story threads". Ah, forgive me, you're here to see the chunky limbs. Here's a recent trailer that shows 'em.

Snug within that frozen instant, you're free to laugh in the gurning faces of the living dead while you idly choose and aim garlic grenades, stake launchers and bouncy ice comets.

This is the same Behaviour Interactive who recently laid off a bunch of people, cancelled a game and closed a studio, Midwinter Entertainment, after bagging themselves a bunch of developers (the others are SockMonkey, Codeglue and Fly Studio) over the past two years. Darkest Dungeon is a horror game like DBD, so I guess the acquisition chimes from that perspective. All the same, my snap judgement is "yikes".

It turns out the game they are playing is: a remaster of amazeballs vampire odyssey Legacy Of Kain: Soul Reaver, together with its less amazing but sturdy sequel. Said remaster project was rumoured earlier this year, when Sarafan scouts caught sight of a telltale plaque at San Diego Comic-Con. Consider that rumour strongly trending towards the status of a Real Thing, because Sony are in the habit of publishing Real Things, and they've just (accidentally, I guess) popped a bunch of screens and a trailer with a release date - 10th December 2024 - on the PlayStation website.

It's fun to write about Spiders, because you get to frighten people for a moment, before they realise you're talking about the game development studio, Spiders. They have just released GreedFall 2: The Dying Land into early access. For those who don't remember the first GreedFall, it was a colonial-styled RPG about landing on the magical shores of another continent and getting into scrapes with monsters and frontiersfolk. This time the story is furthering the fantasy Columbian exchange by putting you in the role of a native who's been uprooted against their will and taken to the "old world". The game's release comes against a backdrop of dissatisfaction in the studio. But workers have gained some concessions in talks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For years, a dangerous and charismatic game has evaded the grasp of many designers. Some say it doesn't exist, that no publisher would ever back it. I'm talking about the one city block RPG that Warren Spector has often mentioned. Sure, we've seen a few usual suspects already - Deus Ex Mankind Divided, Disco Elysium, even Else: Heart.Break - they all grimace in the line-up but nothing ever sticks. Now, out of the gloom of indie development, comes another perp ready to have his mugshot taken. Shadows Of Doubt is an open world detective sim that comes perilously close to being our guy. Its clothes, stature, gait, and fingerprints match the description of what Spector often describes. And yet, if you tilt your head, something is just a little off. The game isn't confined to one block. It's not an RPG precisely. And its simulation has plenty of bugs, jank, and unintentional comedy. But after all this time, in the absence of a smoking gun, shouldn't we just put this guy in the slammer and call the case closed? I say yes, let's. Officers! Arrest this game, it's brilliant.

You might want to chuck in that chickens are basically dinosaurs, because their feet have a "Triassic Flange", a (made-up) term that will make you sound authoritative. If you really want to showcase your knowledge, though, you may want to mention that dinosaurs may have actually fought with large swords lodged between their teeth. Dinoblade demonstrates this! And no, they haven't discovered swords alongside dinosaur fossils yet because palaeontologists have been unlucky thus far. "Soon", you tell them.

They've also "paused" two unannounced games in development, and altered other unannounced games to be more appealing to a "wider audience". Beyond that, they're considering "all possible options regarding our roadmap", which sounds just a touch ominous.

If it's none of these things, I would much rather have a shiny turret on spindly steel legs skitter besides me.
Nomada Studios have, incredibly, thrust their hands into my chest cavity and given me a blood-pumping mechanism. Having spent some time with upcoming action-platformer Neva (the game) and Neva (the dog from the game), I have to admit: I did enjoy petting Neva (the dog).

It’s hard not to be moved by the exaggerated kineticism of it all – the magic-enhanced swordfights, the jumping off cliffs and turning into a flying shadow monster, the ability to drift horses. Yes. Yes!
I’m therefore somewhat unnerved to report that my enthusiasm has been tempered significantly by actually playing it. I’ve since used all the straws I’ve clutched at to spell out "It’s just a demo" on my floor, but the fear remains that Crimson Desert’s fantastical open-world exploration is going to be interrupted by regular bouts of twangy, unwieldy, unsatisfying combat.

I’ve done this many, many times, but on this occasion there was a surprising twist, one which would have notorious pearl-clutching racist HP Lovecraft spinning in his grave. Enotria: The Last Song’s arcane Soulslike language is actually just Italian.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed is a remaster of Disney Epic Mickey, a cult classic 3D platformer first released a decade ago on the Wii. In the original you controlled the titular Mickey Mouse who, armed with a magical paintbrush (wieldable by waving the Wiimote about), could paint or rub out surfaces to solve puzzles. It was the work of Junction Studios led by Warren Spector, best known for being The Deus Ex Guy. No, sadly Mickey could not nano-augment his brush for better target acquisition, nor project laser-guided anti-tank rockets from his podgy white mitts.
And no, Rebrushed doesn't let him do anything of these either. Clearly a missed opportunity. But is it better nonetheless? With an updated look, some added secrets, more moves for Mickey, and controller/M&K support, I'd say longtime Mickey heads will adore this nostalgia trip. For total newcomers like me, I'd say it's a platformer that's certainly charming and clever and wonderfully experimental, but a bit flat in places too.

Writing of the frigid framing of Clockwork Orange’s atrocities, the film critic Pauline Kael asked: “is there anything sadder - and ultimately more repellent - than a clean-minded pornographer?” The lavishly directed and animated universe of God Of War Ragnarok is far from repellent, but it also feels spiritually squeegeed; a world of pulpy violence so chirpy and chaste as to strain belief that the scars that haunt its reformed anti-hero could have ever been inflicted there.

A  new report from Rebekah Valentine at IGN has since shed some more light on the walkout, which reportedly involved “disagreements over the direction of the Interactive division, chaotic departures, communication breakdowns, and a perceived lack of leadership transparency.” It’s a thorough account of some messy events I recommend reading in full, but here’s a brief rundown.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week's Maw, quantified: one compound eye with nine hundred and two quicksilver facets. One and a half wings with the texture of freshly peeled orange. Fifty tentacles, proboscises or flagella, some slender as cheesewire, some thick as a conifer. Ten sets of amethyst dentures shared by ten thousand mouths. One utility coat of muscles.

You can do that anywhere.”
A QA tester with Zenimax currently on union leave, Mitchell joined the Communications Workers Of America (CWA) as a full-time organiser after she and her colleagues formed what was, at the time, the biggest union in videogames - ZeniMax Workers United. Now she helps the CWA do what they did for her and her colleagues at Zenimax: provide support, training, resources and guidance for workers in the videogame industry who have decided, for whatever reason, that they want to unionise.

The major one is that a lot of its quests exist to create distance between places and plot beats. They are overwritten errands such as bringing people lunch or fetching herbs or carrying letters - dessicated, MMO-ish fare, thrust into a moderately enjoyable action-RPG for the sake of incremental worldbuilding and scale.

All I want from my flight simulators is an unerringly accurate recreation of dozens of aircraft, a perfect physics model that includes the spectacle of relevant weather events, and a complete, photorealistic and 1:1 scale depiction of the entire planet earth. 

You, you might be one of those fancy types, you might want to be able to get a job in your flight simulator, like crop duster or fire waterer. That's what Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 is adding to the package when it launches in November. We now know its system requirements.

I think that makes the inclusion of such items as pre-order bonuses for Two Point Museum - alongside Knuckles staff costumes and Sonic-themed interactive exhibits - a pretty strong extra incentive not to pre-order.

But hey, at least the next management game in the growing 2.universe now has a release date: March 4th, 2025.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fifteen months on from its PS5 release, Final Fantasy XVI – that actiony RPG of emo-fringed hack ‘n’ slashing and disquietingly sexy Ralph Ineson characters – is now on PC. Enough time, you’d think, to do a proper job of rejigging it with Windows spanners, especially after Final Fantasy XV’s port got so much stick for its lack of features and performance issues.
FFVXI does make some improvements, adopting a full set of DLSS and FSR upscalers and frame generators, and its mouse and keyboard integration feels generally slicker than XV. Sadly, it’s still no first-rate adaptation, neglecting numerous PC features and giving low-end systems an even deeper kick in the plums. Cutting the quality settings can help, as per the guide down below, but overall performance is so up-and-down than you’ll likely never achieve a perfectly smooth ride.

It’s a turn-based battler with an empire-building component in which you play as several emperors in succession, passing on abilities and knowledge to your heir. In what I consider to be a poetic complementary flourish, you can also pass on save data from the demo to the full game. Look, this is what counts as “poetic” just before lunch on a Thursday.

The developer's next game, Welcome To The Dark Place, is more about hearing. It's an "open-world, auditory text-based adventure" which mostly takes place in pitch blackness.

It's also now got a story expansion, Mask Of Darkness, which came out yesterday.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As I’m sure as is the curse of anyone who’s watched the entirety of Peep Show multiple times, I cannot read the name ‘Marko’ without hearing it in a nasally Australian accent, inquiring about cocaine. This is probably a disservice to the hero of colourful metroidvania Marko: Beyond Brave, who a quick goog tells me may be based on Krali Marko - a popular character in the folklore of Studio Mechka’s native Bulgaria. Folk hero or not, Marko certainly has some heroic facial hair: his moustache floweth so bountifully that it can’t be contained in his character portrait. Extremely powerful of him.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As per EA’s recent generative AI tugathon, the third game in Respawn’s action adventure Star Wars trilogy has been confirmed again to be in development. According to EA, it’ll be the “final chapter" in the now-trilogy, following 2019’s Jedi Fallen Order and 2023’s Jedi Survivor.
The existence of the game was first confirmed by Cal Kestis actor Cameron Monaghan, during an Ocala Comic Con panel. “We’re working on a third and we’re in the process of doing that right now,” said Monaghan, which is about as straightforward an affirmative as one could want. It was also double-confirmed this February, following news of layoffs at EA, via Eurogamer.

We've already seen a description for the PC version appear briefly on the PlayStation store (of all places). And earlier this year a snoopy fan of the studio who monitors the backend of Rockstar's launcher found similar game descriptions buried amid metadata. Yesterday, that same practice yielded yet another clue - the game's Steam app number.

With survival achieved, and the introduction's excellently sinister advisor whispering evil Tory ideas, the whole city you built in Frostpunk is now just the headquarters for a sprawling expansion effort, and your rule is no longer absolute. Rather than retread the same "prepare for ultra-Winter" ground, your biggest obstacle will likely be your own people, now formed into shifting political parties, and looking outward with colonial eyes. The result is a complicated, laborious survival citybuilder that's two parts compelling, and one part frustrating for the wrong reasons.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I really wanted to like action adventure The Plucky Squire more than I do now, having given its charming 2D to 3D platforming a proper whirl. Yes, it's lovely to look at. Yes, hopping out of a storybook and making friends with an illustration on a coffee mug is cool. And yes, everyone can have a mildly fun time with its puzzles and fights. But that's the problem: who is everyone? At first I thought, "This game is for young kids and that's fine!", given its relative simplicity. Then I hit some puzzles and thought, "Ain't no kid figuring this out".
Then it hit me. It struggles to balance the fine line between being approachable for tiny tots and layered enough for people who've graduated from "goo goo ga ga" to "oo oo aa aa my back hurts". And that's down to how plucky you're allowed to squire at any given time, because it can be surprisingly limited and, sadly, a bit underwhelming.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You can't travel back to the 1980s. But what if I told you it was possible to gently warp your memories of that time? UFO 50 is a kart of 50 games that once existed for an old computer system, all lovingly restored by a gang of coders. The old console, of course, is a fiction. The LX-I never existed. But it's a fun pseudo-history against which to create a grab bag of small games (some throwaway, others mighty) all designed with a distinct 80s look. It's an exercise in adhering to an aesthetic. Like an oil painter working with a limited range of colours, the developers of this bundle have stuck to a 32-colour equivalent of the Zorn palette. Yet play a little of each game, and you start to sense the smirk of chronos. These games aren't stuck in the past, but they are enjoying a holiday there.

Hutná atmosféra, tvořená novými permutacemi starých klišé, bez nutnosti uchylovat se k lekačkám a stříkající krvi. Nepotřebuji to vidět znovu, ale dlouho jsem něco tak kvalitního neviděl a nevšiml jsem si mnoha věcí, které by se daly zlepšit. (Ilča 80 %)]]></summary>
