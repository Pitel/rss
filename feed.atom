        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Taking a bite out of your VRAM
We're under a week away from the release of Redfall, the open-world vampire shooter from Arkane. And if you're getting your PC ready for what's in store, Arkane has published the minimum, recommended, and ultra specifications for prospective PC players of Redfall.
Unsurprisingly, this game will take a hefty bite out of your tech to run. While the minimum is roughly what you'd expect, getting Redfall up to Ultra is going to take some solid hardware. Also, it appears you'll need Windows 11 specifically for the ultra mark.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cCFN77wtHY
Curiously, though, the tweet from Arkane does not list out exactly what resolution or frame rate the minimum, recommended, and ultra specs entail. Those factors are usually listed out as part of the specifications, but they're absent in this post. It normally wouldn't be too much of a concern, and anecdotally, I've never had too many problems with Arkane's PC versions.
Still, it won't be long until we know for sure, as Redfall is just a few short days away. The new Arkane joint will hit Xbox Series X|S and PC on May 2.
https://twitter.com/playRedfall/status/1651602111497478144
Here's what you'll need for each specification.
Redfall Minimum specs
CPU: Intel Core i5-8400 @ 2.80 GHz or AMD Ryzen 5 1600
GPU: AMD RX 580 / NVIDIA GTX 1070 / 6 GB VRAM
System RAM: 16 GB
OS: Windows 10 64-bit
Storage: 100 GB SSD
Redfall Recommended specs
CPU: Intel Core i7-9700K @ 3.60 GHz or AMD Ryzen 7 2700X
GPU: AMD 5700 / NVIDIA RTX 2080 / Intel ARC / 8 GB VRAM
System RAM: 16 GB
OS: Windows 10 64-bit
Storage: 100 GB SSD
Redfall Ultra specs
CPU: Intel Core i7-9700K @ 3.60 GHz or AMD Ryzen 7 2700X
GPU: AMD RX 6800 XT / NVIDIA RTX 3080 / 10 GB VRAM

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["7.5 million unique players"
High on Life felt right at home on Game Pass. Even with its technical issues and flaws, it was nonetheless a Game Pass hit. Now, thanks to new info today from Squanch Games, we have more insight into what that actually means.
Apparently 7.5 million unique players have delved into the sci-fi comedy adventure, per an email from developer Squanch Games. This is across "PC via Steam and the Epic Games Store, Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One consoles, with Game Pass on console, PC, and cloud." It's a lot of platforms to amass for the figure for sure, but it's still an accomplishment given the oddball nature of the project.
Here's the full statement from Squanch Games, which includes a few old accolades:
"Today, Squanch Games is thrilled to announce that their latest release, High On Life, now available on PC via Steam and the Epic Games Store; Xbox Series X|S and Xbox One consoles; and with Xbox Game Pass on console, PC, and cloud, has surpassed more than 7.5 million unique players worldwide since its launch in mid-December. High On Life was the top seller on Steam during launch week, the biggest Xbox Game Pass release of 2022, the biggest 3rd party launch in Game Pass history, and the biggest single-player game launch on Game Pass ever."

High on Life 2 is on everyone's mind
Given the bonus ending tease (coupled with a tongue-in-cheek "Sequel-bait" achievement) in High on Life, Squanch Games was likely hoping for a sequel. While the future of Squanch Games' upcoming slate unclear, this is good news for people who wanted the series to continue.
As for the short term, Squanch Games Studio Director Mike Fridley reiterated their commitment to the original, noting: "We will continue to listen carefully and are committed to improving, enhancing and growing the experience as we move forward. We also want to thank our amazing friends at Xbox for all of the love and support on the game.”

Microsoft has kind of taken its foot off of the gas when it comes to Games with Gold (their program where you get two games, free to keep, each month), but it almost never ceases to surprise me. That can be a good or a bad thing in any given month. For May 2023, it's just sheer confusion.
The big game on offer this time is Star Wars Episode 1 Racer, the 1999 game that heavily features podracing, the sport of Star Wars prequel fame. Originally released on the PC and Nintendo 64 (!) back in the day, it eventually worked its way up to many other platforms, including Xbox One on October 27, 2022. That's the one you're getting as of May 1 (through May 31), provided that you're an Xbox subscriber. Truth be told, it's not bad (as Zoey talks about in her opening paragraph about the disappointing follow-up), and I can see tons of people picking this up on a whim and being pleasantly surprised by it. There's a lot to do, and it doesn't play like a lot of modern racers, in the sense that it's way faster, as a whole.
2021's Hoa is the other game set for May's Games with Gold program, and the visuals alone are likely enough to sway people into giving it a try. Say what you will about giving people a port of a 20+ year old game, but I'm actually kind of into this upcoming month!
New Games with Gold for May, 2023
Star Wars Episode I Racer ($14.99 ERP): Available May 1 to 31
Hoa ($14.99 ERP): Available May 16 to June 15

Two new public events are coming our way in the summer via cryptid encounters, building on the prior cryptid focus of the past. The crafting interface was also overhauled (it's easier to see descriptions of mods), and way more information is shown for just about every item in the game, including AP costs and damage over time (DOT) effects). It's all part of Bethesda's effort to make the game more accessible as you dig further into the more esoteric systems.

Cadence of Hyrule was one of those "instantly out" E3 games of old, and in 2019, it was a stunner. Nintendo typically doesn't lend out its IP to just any studio, and Brace Yourself Games seemingly hit the jackpot with a version of Crypt of the Necrodancer based on the classic Zelda series. Not only did it have the great foundation from Necrodancer in tow: but it also expanded on the original concept in many ways, while adding a ton of Zelda-related flair. I really enjoyed it and couldn't put it down for weeks, and you can share that same experience soon: for free.
Well, free is relative, as you'll need to be a part of the Nintendo Switch Online program (thankfully it's not gated behind the Expansion Pack) to partake. The next Game Trial, as conf…]]></summary>

Does the gameplay of 1983’s Popeye on the NES appeal to you, but you just can’t get behind the beloved golden age license attached to it? What’s wrong with you? Where did you leave your soul? If that’s the case, the Resident Evil 3: Chibi Edition might be for you.
Created by a super-team of modders, Protopixel and Crying Onion, Resident Evil 3: Chibi Edition gives the NES arcade port a full Resident Evil make-over. Players now control Jill Valentine as they avoid the persistent Nemesis T-Type. Leon “SoccerJock” Kennedy fills in for Olive Oyl to offer assitance, and Carlos Oliveira takes over as Swee’Pea. Check it out in this video via Hack Games Longplay.
https://youtu.be/yaPd2QFjlVQ
The best part of this recasting is when Jill consumes a red herb and gains the strength to clobber Nemesis. I mean, what if that was the plot of Resident Evil 3 instead? Jill should have just kept dosing herself with genetic and viral cocktails until she was a bigger monster than Nemesis and just beat the crap out of him. Gosh, I’d play that.
Beyond the characters getting a make-over, the backgrounds have had their palettes tweaked to look more like Raccoon City. The music, on the other hand, is still the same music, which feels hilariously out of place.
Popeye was already a great NES port of a terrific arcade game. While the modders obviously made Resident Evil 3: Chibi Edition for fun, it feels terrifically executed and great to experience. Even if you don’t intend to play it, the video in this article features a full playthrough so you can experience the whole thing.

Microids has announced that Inspector Gadget: Mad Time Party will release in 1983… No, wait, I mean September 2023.
Sorry, I’m confused. Inspector Gadget wrapped up its initial television run before I was born, and despite that, I watched a heckuva lot of it in my youth thanks to syndication. It’s had a few revivals and spin-offs since then, but Mad Time Party seems to be based on the original series.
I’d actually be really down with a new game based off Inspector Gadget, but it turns out that Mad Time Party is a party game. I’m a severe introvert. Even the word “party” triggers me in the same way the word “salt” triggers a snail.
[caption id="attachment_375850" align="alignnone" width="640"] Image via Microids[/caption]
It might not be a total loss, however. There is a single-player mode that allows you to explore Metro City and complete challenges and quests. The story involves time travel and the eponymous inspector competing against his ancestors for parts of a time machine. They’ve brought in Tanis Chalopin, which is the daughter of Inspector Gadget’s creator, Jean Chalopin, to do the soundtrack. That means they’ll at least have some respect for the property.
It’s not… inspiring much faith. Also, it’s going to cost $39.99 USD, which seems like a lot. It’s setting off my morbid curiosity, at least.
Inspector Gadget: Mad Time Party is coming PC, PS4, PS5, and Switch sometime in September 2023.

After the expansive 'Return to Castlevania' DLC last month, we imagined that it might be a little while before we get our next big update for Dead Cells. Clearly, we were wrong.
Publisher Motion Twin has today announced that a lengthy new patch, 'Clean Cut', is now available on PC and will be heading to consoles soon. This seems to be yet another big one, adding in two new weapons, additions to the Boss Rush and Training Room, a speedrun mode and the ability to put Bobby's head on most outfits.

Might & Magic: Clash of Heroes is getting a second wind with a Definitive Edition. The  well-remembered puzzle-battle game is getting a new version produced by Dotemu.
The Might & Magic series itself is an old one in games, and Clash of Heroes is a unique, superb take on it. It's a blend of tactics and puzzle gameplay, where you match units on a board to send them after the opponent, going back and forth in turn-based, line-driven puzzle battles.
Originally developed by Capybara Games, published by Ubisoft, and released in 2009, the Might & Magic: Clash of Heroes Definitive Edition is getting a refresh from Dotemu. Via a press release, Dotemu says it has not altered the "established scope and vision" of the game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Repairing a fallen society
Naughty Dog continues in its efforts to roll out patches for its disappointing PC port of The Last of Us Part I, with each new update bringing it closer and closer to the quality expected of the Californian studio. The newest patch, Version 1.0.4.0, released yesterday with another fistful of fixes.
Looking at the patch notes, it seems that this particular update focuses on CPU/GPU compatibility, while optimizing the PC edition of the dramatic remake for the Steam Deck platform. Graphics in general have been improved at lower settings, (water no longer appears as a black void), while an array of random crashes and U.I. bugs have also been eliminated, including one which saw the game report a critical error occasionally when skipping cutscenes during loading.
Mush Room for Improvement
For all of you Achievement fans, the busted "It Can't Be for Nothing" achievement should now pop, while non-English speaking players will be pleased to hear that multiple corrections have been made to language errors in the menus and in-game subtitles. Naughty Dog ends the notes by reiterating its commitment to improving The Last of Us Part I's PC port in the coming weeks and months.
"We at Naughty Dog and our partners at Iron Galaxy are closely watching player reports to support future improvements and patches. We are actively optimizing, working on game stability, and implementing additional fixes which will all be included in regularly released future updates."
The Last of Us Part I is available now on PS5 and PC/Steam.

Planning a multi-turn offensive in a 4X game like Civilization or outfitting your party with optimal gear in a Strategy RPG like Fire Emblem: Three Houses can take much trial-and-error and many of us can only grab small windows of gaming time.

Happily, developers Color Gray Games have announced a new DLC pack is coming for The Golden Idol next week called The Spider Of Lanka. Set in 1741, a year before the first scenario of The Golden Idol proper, this trio of new cases looks set to shed extra light on the titular idol whose mysterious powers set the original game in motion. I'm afraid I can't tell you much more than that, as most of the announcement details have been slapped with big black REDACTED marks. Have a watch of the reveal trailer below instead.

Paradox has announced the last stops in its Cities: Skylines “World Tour” content push that will bring us to the end of the DLC for the game. The big ticket item here is the Hotels & Retreats mini-expansion, but there is also a slate of Content Creator Packs coming with it. It’s all set to drop on May 23, 2023.
Hotels & Retreats does essentially what it says on the tin. Sort of. It enables you to plop hotels in your city and run them. This runs in line with previous expansions like the Campus one that gave you things that would, I expect, be largely outside of your municipal power. I can’t see the mayor/city planner getting involved in the day-to-day of managing a hotel, but that’s what this expansion asks you to do.

Twisted Metal is being developed by Peacock and stars Anthony Mackie as protagonist John Doe, a “smart ass” delivery driver who transports supplies between settlements in a post-apocalyptic America. He has no memory of his past but gets a chance at a better life by making one special delivery across the dangerous landscape.

Tonally, the series is billed as an action comedy. Other characters include Sweet Tooth, who will be voiced by Will Arnett and physically performed by pro wrestler Samoa Joe. The cast also includes Stephanie Beatriz, Thomas Haden Church, Richard Cabral, Tahj Vaughans, and Neve Campbell. The show is being produced by Sony Pictures Television and PlayStation Productions, and it's the second TV adaptation of a first-party PlayStation game to arrive this year following The Last of Us. 
Twisted Metal premieres on July 27 exclusively on Peacock and consists of 10 half-hour-long episodes. We'll update this story with the teaser trailer when it becomes available.]]></summary>

We had a great time with Atelier Ryza 3: Alchemist of the End & the Secret Key when it came to Switch a little over a month ago, granting it an 'Excellent' 9/10 in our review (which you can find in full below). Today, publisher Koei Tecmo has released a fresh new update for the game, levelling it up to ver. 1.3.0.
The majority of the tweaks this time around are to do with improving the game as it stands and fixing any small bugs, though there are a couple of new features available. These include the addition of a 'Maximum Difficulty' mode (for all those that wanted even more of a challenge), and the ability to change the game's background music for specific scenes.

This week is a nice bookend between Advance Wars 1+2: Re-Boot Camp and Zelda, and people are taking advantage of it.
Omega Strikers is the big offering this week, with a worldwide release on basically every platform today. It's a free-to-play venture that doubles as a member of the "action sport" genre, with a nice intro from anime house Studio Trigger. I'm cautiously optimistic and hope the free-to-play elements don't ruin it.

The latest Japanese charts are in from Famitsu (via Gematsu) and this week sees Mojang's latest foray into the world of strategy games taking the top spot as Minecraft Legends pulls in 13,490 sales from its debut (a very low number to be in first place, compared to what we have seen in recent months).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bloober Team and Anshar Studios have released a new Layers of Fear gameplay trailer to demonstrate the game's performance in Unreal Engine 5. 
Layers of Fear combines the experience of the first two Layers of Fear games, as well as both games' DLC, into one single game. It will also feature a new chapter called "The Final Note" that gives players an alternate perspective on the first game's story. Layers of Fear is being developed from the ground up in Unreal Engine 5. You can check out the game's performance, as well as its new mechanics and visual enhancements, in the gameplay trailer below: 


Layers of Fear will support Ray-Tracing, HDR, and 4K resolution. Plus, it uses Lumen global illumination (you might recognize the word "Lumen" from Epic Games' Unreal Engine showcase back in 2021), Niagara visual effects "to create particle effects in real time" and Action System Controls "to improve the development process and optimization of all gameplay mechanics," according to a press release. 
"Creating games with Unreal Engine 5 is a great opportunity for the whole team, as it means our game development process can skyrocket in quality," Anshar Studios lead programmer Tomasz Bilnicki writes in the press release. "It has an incredible power when it comes to the implementation of dynamic lighting, shadows, and potentially beautiful worlds for players to explore. We hope that – thanks to the engine – we'll provide players with the unique, immersive, visually stunning, and atmospheric experience in graphical fidelity." 
Layers of Fear will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC in June.

The LEGO Company has released a teaser video giving fans a glimpse of some of the new figures headed to its ever-expanding LEGO Super Mario toy line — The five new figures, which were revealed on the company's Twitter, represent the key members of the much-loved Donkey Kong family.
In the video, we can see the unmistakable designs of Cranky Kong, Diddy Kong, and Daisy Kong, as well as the main man, Donkey Kong himself. And because no game is complete without a Funky Kong mode, then that totally tubular ape is also putting in an appearance, wraparound shades and all. While the characters' features are yet to be detailed, we can assume that these battery-operated LCD figures will interact with the LEGO Super Mario playsets, much like previous releases Mario, Luigi, and Daisy.
Something appears to be going on with Diddy's tail... not quite sure what that's about.
https://twitter.com/LEGO_Group/status/1651224656991379456?s=20
The LEGO Super Mario series first launched in 2020, featuring the iconic Nintendo mascot and several basic playsets. Since then, the line has greatly expanded, with playsets based on Bowser's Castle, Luigi's Mansion, Bowser's Airship, and even The Big Man himself. These sets feature augmented play action, with sound effects and other neat tricks playing out as the figures are placed on and around the homemade courses. The Donkey Kong family of figures will undoubtedly add new options for set growth, as young LEGO and Super Mario fans build a Mushroom Kingdom of their very own.
The LEGO Super Mario series is available now at toy stockists.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[August 25, 2023
FromSoftware and Bandai Namco have announced that Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon will be ready to drop on August 25, 2023. That’s soon! They’ve opened up pre-orders and have provided a new trailer as an appetizer.
The trailer actually gives us some good looks at the gameplay, and it looks… very much like an Armored Core game. We’re shown a lot of industrial sci-fi environments and some large-scale robots, and all this is underneath a pulsing soundtrack and various sound clips of dramatic sounding dialogue.
https://youtu.be/wz3yRaHTPHM
The story of Armored Core VI involves a newly discovered substance called “Coral.” It was located on the titular planet of Rubicon 3. It was being used for a technological boom, but in the rush to harness it, it causes a catastrophe that engulfs the entire star system in the titular fire. Now, a bunch of groups are fighting over the resurfaced Coral, and you join the fray as an independent mercenary.
You can expect all the intense mech customization the series is known for. If you're unfamiliar, I can tell you this: Just so, so much mech customization. So much.
I’m something of a lapsed Armored Core fan. I checked out after Armored Core 4 disappointed me in ways I can’t express without screaming. I was going to get back into the series, but after the first announcement of Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon, someone went through and bought up every copy of the series’ entries from my local shop. Rude.
Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon is coming to PC, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PS4, and PS5 on August 25, 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From Software, the developer behind last year's critically acclaimed Elden Ring, announced Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon at The Game Awards 2022. Now, less than six months later, we have a release date, and it's probably sooner than you expected. 
That's because Armored Core VI hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on August 25, 2023. From Software announced this out of nowhere with a surprise trailer today that runs more than three minutes long. It features plenty of flashy mech action and some teases about what might be going on in this beautiful (but distraught) sci-fi world. 
Check out the new Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon is a drastic departure from the fantasy worlds of late that From Software has been creating, but this still looks decidedly From Software. And we can't wait to check it out in just a few months. 
The trailer also reveals what you can expect from the game's various digital editions and the special Collector's Edition – check them both out below: 

Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon launches on August 25, 2023. While waiting to learn more, check out the reveal trailer from last December. Read about From Software's Shadow of the Erdtree expansion for Elden Ring after that.

When I checked out the Mail Time demo earlier this year, I had a number of reservations. It felt rough and directionless, both of which are okay in a pre-release demo, but don’t inspire much faith. I need some indication that the concept will be delivered on. I need to see some chops. There weren’t a lot of chops on display in the Mail Time demo, which left me feeling cold.
So cold that I almost passed on the opportunity to review it. I was afraid that this would be yet another “cozy” game that thinks that being wholesome means not having any potato on its plate. That it would focus so much on being non-threatening that it loses all it’s depth and becomes a hollow, uncharming experience.
And I was right.
No, I’m joking. I’m never right. Mail Time is a good time.

The game is set to release this summer and provides all of the adventuring and puzzling that the DS original did but with a fresh lick of paint and a good number of quality-of-life improvements thrown in for good measure.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Redfall, the vampire FPS from Deathloop developer Arkane Studios, is out in less than a week and to prepare players for what awaits, the team has released a new launch trailer aptly set to a cover of Soundgarden's "Black Hole Sun." 
It's a nice cover, and it goes quite well with what's happening in Redfall, Massachusetts, as a total eclipse has made it a haven for the game's enemy vampires. The launch trailer itself is more of what you'd expect from a Redfall trailer – vampires, cooperative action, special abilities, and plenty of FPS gunplay. Check it out for yourself below: 


For more about Redfall, read about how the game will only launch with a Quality Mode (although a 60 FPS Performance Mode is planned for post-launch), and then read about how Microsoft canceled a PlayStation 5 version of Redfall after it acquired Arkane parent company Bethesda. Listen to our thoughts on the game after going hands-on with Redfall after that. 
Redfall launches on Xbox Series X/S and PC next Tuesday on May 2.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Firaxis first unveiled their new tactical superhero RPG Marvel's Midnight Suns in August of 2021, its card-based battle system proved to be a point of contention among its audience, so much so that when the game was delayed a short while later, rumours started flying that the studio was going back to the drawing board on the game's combat and dropping the cards entirely. 
"Hah, that was wishful thinking for some people!" laughs director Jake Solomon when I ask him at GDC how he felt about those rumours at the time. It's well-known now that the delay was simply about polishing the game rather than anything more drastic, but to Solomon's credit he does also concede that he was perhaps "a little naïve" at the time for thinking it would go down without question.

The Japanese Street Fighter 6 Twitter account has released a short video, ostensibly focusing on the upcoming fighter's new "Battle Damag"e feature — Sneakily, however, the clip also gives us our first look at a brand new stage, as well as a handful of characters' classic, or "nostalgia", costumes.
Kicking things off, we see Family Man Guile in his old-school, Street Fighter II combat fatigues, squaring off against the Big Red Pants of The Iron Body, Zangief. Later on in the video, we also see Chun-Li, in the split dress that made her a superstar, battling a white Gi-wearing Ryu. Curiously, after not sporting a beard and moustache for literal decades, Street Fighter's original poster boy now looks practically naked without one.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I don't feel very strongly about Age Of Wonders 4. But I’ll be fair; it's definitely good.
I've enjoyed most of my time with it, and the parts I didn't were probably down to caning it too hard in too short a time. Such is that reviewz lyf. Played less intensely over a longer period, I imagine more of its intricacies becoming clear, and more custom playstyles emerging to encourage more replays and challenges. As it stands though, its generally high quality and interesting systems just haven't captured my imagination.
It is not unimaginative, though. Some of its playable races are the usual elves and goblins, but most have a twist, like the cannibalistic dwarves, gold-obsessed necromancers, or the "cursed toadlings" I picked almost reflexively: a people transformed along with their warrior Queen Charming. Each comes with a starting hero and traits for their cities units, plus a set of spellbooks that determine what research you'll have access to upfront.

Nintendo has revealed that it will be in attendance for this year's Gamescom, which is scheduled to take place in Germany in August — As confirmed by Koelnmesse and The German Games Industry Association, The House of Mario will make its return at the annual event, marking the first time in four years that the publisher has made the trip to the European expo.
"We are excited to announce that Nintendo will be exhibiting at Gamescom 2023," said the event's organizers on Twitter. "Many more exhibitors will follow in the coming weeks. Stay tuned!"
Nintendo's attendance comes as something of a surprise as the publisher has not only shied away from exhibiting at industry events in recent years, but will have also already launched its biggest titles (that we know of) for 2023 — namely Metroid Prime Remastered, Fire Emblem Engage, and the incoming Pikmin 4, and The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. One might assume that the publisher simply wishes to further promote these releases.
https://twitter.com/gamescom/status/1651179325167906816?s=20
But, perhaps Nintendo has a surprise or two up its sleeve — Gamescom 2023 will, as always, premiere with Geoff Keighley's "Opening Night Live" streaming event which, in the wake of E3's struggles, has become the de-facto summer streaming event for major updates and announcements. Will Nintendo have something to showcase during this live stream? Right now, it's a dice roll, but seeing the publisher actually leave its offices for once is definitely a curious situation.
Gamescom 2023 will take place at Koelnmesse, Germany between August 22-27. Opening Night Live will take place on the evening of August 22.

Nintendo has been adding various icons as bonuses for My Nintendo users, which range all across their suite of first party games (and beyond). Whenever a big game drops you can bet Nintendo will peddle some icons for it: and in case you missed the last Zelda: Breath of the Wild round, there's another one on the way.
Announced by Nintendo, a "second chance" run of Zelda: Breath of the Wild icons are available now. The first wave is scheduled to go away (back into the vault) on May 3, 2023, and the second wave will kick off on that same day through May 10. Out of all these, the Guardian one is fairly unique, and the general "Zelda" logo will slot in nicely for a lot of folks for years to come: even if Breath of the Wild fades into memory.
As a reminder, if you want physical rewards, you can find our full Platinum Point guide here, which has been updated with details on weekly missions: bookmark it for when you need quick points for a reward. A handful of points is incredibly easy to get, as that’s basically just 15 minutes with Super Mario Run, or a quick sign-on to the 3DS or Wii U 3Shop. Also remember that any shipments are bundled together, so you can pay a flat rate for multiple items instead of paying it each time. Just know that items go out of stock on My Nintendo frequently, and some are never restocked.

A young boy named Olle treks through dark woods after his missing sister. At first, nothing seems awry, yet he soon comes upon pinecones arranged in strange formations. Not long after, a massive shadow flits overhead. In the distance, obscured by the moonlight slanting through the trees, a massive, insidious shape lumbers by. This is Bramble: The Mountain King, a dark folktale game with a hefty helping of puzzle platforming steeped in Nordic myth.
As you can imagine, Olle has to go through quite a few trials to rescue his sister, Lillemor, from the Mountain King. Giant pig demons try to slice him up with equally massive cleavers. A grotesque nymph, channeling the lifeforce of the men it lured, killed, and trussed up to trees, attempts to obliterate the young boy with blood magic, and more.

I see a flicker of anger in her eyes, as well as maybe, just maybe, a spark of interest.


A new Dota patch came out last week, and it’s a biggun. Is it a good time for lapsed players to jump back in? Yes! Is it a good time for entirely new players to dip their toes in, while experienced players are still befuddled by a map that’s 40% bigger, featuring dual Roshan pits, new minibosses and a host of other changes? Perhaps! It’s certainly a good opportunity to test your relationship.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I meet Jake Solomon at GDC, it's his third day of unemployment. The XCOM and Marvel's Midnight Suns director and designer announced he was leaving Firaxis back in February, but his final day at the studio where he made his name and worked for more than twenty years was still very fresh in his memory. "It's surreal," he says. "For probably the next ten years, I'll refer to it as 'we' when we talk about Firaxis, and it's sad to think it's not the right pronoun anymore. It's exciting, but a little terrifying."
On the face of it, that panic might seem unfounded. Over the last decade, Solomon has become one of the most revered names in turn-based strategy games. Having cut his teeth on many of Sid Meier's Civilization games in his early years at Firaxis, he went on to become the designer who spearheaded the revival of XCOM with Enemy Unknown in 2012, before going on to direct its even more beloved sequel XCOM 2 and its War Of The Chosen expansion a few years later. Most recently, he was creative director on Marvel's Midnight Suns, which allowed him to marry his life-long love of Marvel comic books with the thrilling tactical combat he's so well known for. 
Solomon's next adventure, though, won't have the certainty of Midnight Suns' supercharged attack cards, or even the tease of an XCOM hit percentage backing him up. For not only is it Solomon's third day of unemployment when we speak; it's also the day after he revealed his plans to leave turn-based tactics games behind altogether. Instead, his sights are now set on the life simulation genre, a move that, at first glance, seems at odds with his career as a strategy designer. But over the course of our hour-long chat, it becomes increasingly clear that life sims have been a life-long obsession for Solomon, and he might have even made one by now had the development of XCOM 2 gone a little differently.

In other words, this is a new experience within Warframe that’s immediately available to newcomers, while also adding weird cool stuff for old-timers.

Sony has released images of a special PS5 bundle that it will be releasing in conjunction with Square Enix' upcoming RPG Final Fantasy XVI — The limited edition is expected to launch in June, alongside the majestic-looking adventure title.
The Limited Edition PS5 Bundle includes a standard white PS5 console, a DualSense controller, and a digital copy of Final Fantasy XVI. This set will be available exclusively through the PlayStation Direct store, with pre-orders scheduled to go live on May 4. A U.S. price was not announced, but it might be worth noting that the previous God of War Ragnarok bundle retailed for $550 USD.
There will be a limited number of these bundles available, so prep that click finger.

Additionally, Sony Japan will be launching an attractive, Final Fantasy XVI-themed DualSense Controller, as well as a sleek console cover for the unit itself, emblazoned with the markings of Valisthea. These delightfully designed items will bring elegance and class to the somewhat bulky hardware, and as such are expected to be quite popular. Unfortunately, as of this writing, Sony has not announced plans to release these items in the west, but we'll be sure to let you know if this situation changes.

Final Fantasy XVI launches June 22, exclusively on PS5.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After a few weeks in time limbo, Quantum Break has returned to storefronts on PC and Xbox. Publisher Microsoft had said “some licences that expired” were to blame for its removal from Game Pass (for consoles), which was probably the same reason it was pulled from storefronts too.

Yesterday, Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard was officially blocked in the UK by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA). This was accompanied by a 418-page final report that elaborates on how the authority reached its decision.
The report outlines several reasons for the block, including how it would directly impact the "fast-growing cloud gaming market", though one further reason that has been brought to our attention today (thanks, WCCFTech) is directly related to the Nintendo Switch.

As you have probably seen by now, the first impressions of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom have officially gone live. Nintendo's already shown a lot of select footage from the game, but one thing that hasn't been confirmed just yet is the sequel's performance and resolution.
Fortunately, it seems previews have been able to get an idea of how the new entry runs thanks to directly captured footage. As highlighted by Nintendo World Report, this build of Tears of the Kingdom ran at 30fps with a resolution of 1600 x 900 (900p) in docked mode. It was also mentioned how the game was "consistently" running at this frame rate in most cases, but there were drops during more heated moments.

Horizon Forbidden West: Burning Shores serves fans a substantial dessert that brings the main course of the campaign to a satisfying close. A dangerous new sandbox and a compelling story await Aloy, offering a nice wrap-up that also provides some tantalizing glimpses into the future. 
Unlike Zero Dawn’s Frozen Wilds DLC, which was a good but skippable side story, Burning Shores has enough relevant plot advancement to make it closer to required playing. Taking place immediately after the sequel’s conclusion, this abbreviated tale sees Aloy travel to the volcanically fra…]]></summary>

Honkai Star Rail has arrived on mobile and PC, letting players board the Astral Express and explore the cosmos. You don’t need to know anything about the previous game in the series, Honkai Impact 3rd, to play this gacha RPG. However, there are some things you should know about before playing.
For example, you might find yourself overwhelmed with all the systems Honkai Star Rail introduces to you. Even if you are a veteran of MiHoYo's Genshin Impact, there are a few aspects of Honkai Star Rail that initially look confusing, not least of which is the combat. Here are eight key beginner tips to get you started in Honkai Star Rail.

As someone who has played a lot of campaign-based games over the course of my life (sometimes 50+ times each, depending on the game!), the ability to skip through a campaign when playing alts (alternate characters) can be a godsend. World of Warcraft eventually added this as a quality-of-life feature over time, and thankfully, Diablo IV will be going in that same direction; so long as you finish the campaign once.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQtOIeKRXaY
Blizzard showed off, then confirmed, a "skip campaign" button for alts
Just this week, Blizzard put out a new video for Diablo IV titled "Inside the Game: Your Class Your Way." The main intent was to show off how customizable the game was from top to bottom (including character creation examples and transmog options); but eagle-eyed viewers saw a special button during the showcase.
So the button in question comes up at 2:50 in the above video. Take a look at the right side of the character select screen, below the World Tier section. You'll see a "skip campaign" option right there.
[caption id="attachment_375691" align="alignnone" width="640"] Image via Blizzard[/caption]
The button was spotted by Twitter user DatModz, and Diablo Blizard Global Community Development Director Adam Fletcher stepped in to provide some extra context. Fletcher noted in a reply tweet that you "gotta beat the campaign once for this," dispelling the notion of being able to just "skip the campaign altogether." It was fairly obvious, but confirmation is confirmation!
The idea of skipping the campaign outright was already debunked in the video itself, as the first character shown in that same section of the video (a Barbarian) did not have the "skip campaign" option.
The post Confirmed: Diablo IV will have a skip campaign button appeared first on Destructoid.]]></summary>

One of the titles that had the greatest impact on my consciousness in the past few years was Happy’s Humble Burger Farm. What seemed like a novel concept on the surface turned out to have a lot of beef underneath. Centering a horror game around cooking is engrossing enough, but it then gets tied up in interesting ways and dunked into an unconventional world full of mystery and horror. The narrative tells the story of trying to escape from an obvious simulation, but the world in which this simulation exists is an entity worth exploring on its own.

Bytten Studios and Raw Fury have announced that the Pokémon-inspired monster-fusing RPG Cassette Beasts is coming to consoles, including Switch, on 25th May. You've only got a month to wait until you can get funky with some unusual, adorable pixel art creatures.
The game is out today on PC via Steam and the Microsoft Store, and the reviews have been pretty darn glowing for this new take on the monster-taming genre. Our friends over at Rock Paper Shotgun call it "a smart, evolutionary offshoot" (but go read their review right now if you want to know why), and we can't wait to dive in next month.

Somehow, despite being primed by the excellent time I had with its demo five years ago, I just bounced off this one. I very quickly got stuck in a frustrating loop of fatally ballsing up no matter what I did - presumably I badly biffed my stats right out the gate to get soft-locked in the first area - and despite deciding I'd restart in a day or two, several years later my play-time hasn't extended past that first session. Sad times all round, I'm sure you'll agree, but what's it got to do with Betrayal At Club Low?
Well, when I picked up Betrayal At Club Low for the RPS Game Club this month, I was transported back to my abortive run at Disco Elysium. It's not that I've never played a stat-check-heavy RPG before. Far from it. But somehow, each game's presentation resonated together in my weird brain mush. It must have been something to do with the combination of a surreal, seedy, not-quite-our-world-but-still-very-recognisable setting, and the constant presence of numbers reminding me of my character's strengths stacked up against their many, many weaknesses.

Telling a narrative in an interactive way is something that’s still being explored and developed today. Video games have long emulated books and movies to tell their tales, both of which directly rip all control out of your hands and force you to sit and watch or, ugh, read. Part of Half-Life’s appeal in 1998 was that it didn’t do that. It let you experience the story without taking it away from you.
And for a lot of games, that was far enough. As long as you could poke at the microwave while someone spoke to you, that was interactive storytelling. Never mind that you could tell it just as easily in film.
Part of the issue is that players have a hard time sitting still when there are things to kill. When you’re a hammer, and there are nails everywhere,…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Battle Beyond the Stars
ININ Games, in association with Irem and Tozai Games, has announced Irem Collection Volume 1, a compilation of classic shmups from the old-school arcade developer. Currently in development for PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch, the release will include some titles which are receiving their first-ever official localization.

Irem Collection Volume 1 — the first of what is set to be a five-volume set — will feature three titles in total. They are Image Fight (1988), Image Fight II: Operation Deepstriker (1992), and the iconic bio-blaster XMultiply (1992). These three vertically scrolling shmups were all smash hits during the renaissance of the arcade scene, and were among the tidal wave of titles that helped to keep the genre alive as gaming headed into the 1990s.
In addition to the digital release, ININ Games will release a physical edition of Irem Collection Volume 1, (and, presumably, its following four volumes). This set, available for PlayStation and Nintendo Switch, includes a hard copy of the game, a visual compendium, replica arcade flyers, a double-disc CD soundtrack, replica boxes for Image Fight and Image Fight 2's home releases, as well as some cool, A2 sized posters for all three titles. A price or release date was not announced for this edition.
Irem Collection Volume 1 is currently in development for PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch.

April is already coming to a close, and that means a new month is on the horizon, with a new slew of games for PS Plus. Sony has revealed its PlayStation Plus May lineup, which features some extreme sports and chivalric endeavors.
May 2023's PlayStation Plus lineup is led by GRID Legends, a racing game with some story to it. Via the PlayStation blog, GRID Legends has a cast that includes Ncuti Gatwa (Sex Education) and follows the race-track drama of the racing world.
Or maybe you want a different kind of sport, and turn instead toward Descenders, where you can challenge procedurally generated hills on a bike. Nail sick tricks and earn new looks as you try to stay upright on the downhill slopes.
Of course, you could also just brawl it out in Chivalry 2, the medieval warfare simulator full of grisly, rewarding swordfights. I played a bit of this on PC a while ago, and had a good time with it. It's the right mix of surprisingly intricate combat and absolutely goofy moments.
https://twitter.com/PlayStation/status/1651247336843014146
It's a pretty alright lineup, in my opinion. It hits that sweet spot of games I might not have sought out personally, but I'm open to giving them a shot if it doesn't cost me much. Keep in mind that last month's games—Meet Your Maker, Sackboy: A Big Adventure, and Tails of Iron—leave the PS Plus lineup on May 1.
Building out Plus
These are the selections available for all tiers of PlayStation Plus. Meanwhile, the higher tier selections for PS Plus specifically for the Extra and Premium levels, tend to get announced later on in the month.
We'll see what that holds, though we do know that Humanity will be among the Game Catalog offerings in PlayStation Plus for May.

It's time to take the money and run and gun, as Infinity Ward is prepping a new update for its popular battle royale title Call of Duty Warzone 2.0, which sees a return for the frantic heist mode, Plunder. The mode is scheduled to go live on all platforms today, alongside a new, bug-smashing patch.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSasrsV9jAo&ab_channel=PlayStation
One of the initial two modes that launched with Call of Duty Warzone back in 2020, Plunder tasks teams of players with snatching up bags of cash and transporting them to a central drop-off point, while simultaneously defending their horde from the sticky fingers of the opposing team members. It's a frenetic running battle that can turn on a dime, and requires strong synergy, efficient movement, and, as always, a precise aim. Warzone players will no doubt be pleased to see the challenging side-game return.
In addition to Plunder's comeback, Infinity Ward has released an update to both Warzone 2.0 and Modern Warfare 2 proper, featuring an array of bug fixes pertaining mostly to errors in the U.I. and HUD systems. In regards to CoD gameplay itself, the new patch adds more ammo caches to the Zaya Observatory in multiplayer map Ground War, and reduces the number of available lasers for the arsenal-running Gunfight mode. You can check out the full patch notes over on the official Call of Duty blog.
Call of Duty Warzone 2.0 is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

Here at Nintendo Life, we are rather excited about a little upcoming game called The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom — you might have heard of it. It seems that after six years of waiting, the run-up to the game's release date has come about rather quickly and now we are awash with trailers, promotional material and, as of today, hands-on previews.
Yes, we can now start to get an idea of how this sequel actually plays on Switch before the big 12th May release date, and the consensus appears to be very positive indeed. To shed light on what the critics have thought so far, we have collected together a handful of the available preview write-ups so you can get an idea of what everybody had to say.

In the game you, as a dog, must direct an endless stream of humans as they mindlessly walk forward. It's up to you to make sure they reach safety. Join Charles Harte and me as we play a few puzzles (without revealing the final solutions) and make sure Humanity can live on. At least, I think that's what the game is about.
As a bonus, the game is also fully playable in VR using PlayStation VR2, so we took the time to show off that version of the game, as well. It is functionally the same, but it's nice to have an alternate, encompassing way to play.

Did you know the 30th anniversary of the Jurassic Park film is coming up? Holy gosh, I am so old! Limited Run Games seems willing to sacrifice this horrible entropy by bringing us a collection of “classic” Jurassic Park titles. They've teased us with The Jurassic Park 30th Anniversary Retro Collection, but we'll have to wait until June to get more info.
The bad news is that only the titles developed by Ocean are teased. The good news is they’re not all bad, and the SNES version is among them.
https://twitter.com/LimitedRunGames/status/1650961515405537288?s=20
I’ve spent more time than I ever imagined talking about the 1993 SNES version of Jurassic Park. It isn’t great and has many problems, but you can tell the developers had serious passion for the project. It uses ray-casting to create first-person indoor environments the same year Doom came out, and there are several small touches that give it life.
I can’t really speak for the rest of the games. The NES and Game Boy versions of the first title are extremely similar. Jurassic Park Part 2: The Chaos Continues is different on SNES and Game Boy. They’re side-scrollers, and despite the title, they’re not really sequels in terms of style or mechanics. I own the SNES version but haven’t played it for more than a few minutes. It’s very difficult to get over the disappointment of it not being a continuation of the previous SNES title.
Beyond the tease and the promise that they’ll announce more in June, Limited Run is being tight-lipped on what they intend to do with these titles. They say it will be The Jurassic Park 30th Anniversary Retro Collection, but will it be reproductions of these titles or a release on current consoles? They say we’ll see it later this year.

This question was at the forefront of Jay Baylis and Tom Coxon’s early discussions on what would later become Cassette Beasts, a creature-collecting RPG with an emphasis on good tunes that launches on Switch on 25th May. The duo makes up Bytten Studio and has some experience under their video game belts, as both Baylis and Coxon previously worked on games such as Wargroove and Starbound over at Chucklefish. Together, they’re now tackling a genre dominated by that multimedia powerhouse, Pokémon.

Oh alright. Star Wars Jedi: Survivor is a third-person action game where you play Cal Kestis in his second rip-roaring adventure across a localised part of the galaxy, fighting both the Empire and a very naughty little Sith, with a flanking attack from Cal's own regrets about getting people killed all the time. Crucially though, at least for the purposes of having fun, Cal has one of those hot glowsticks that goes *whummmmm* and cute robot friend BD-1 - but you will often be deploying both in the effort to get a new pair of trousers.

Picking up where its predecessor left off, Jedi: Survivor isn’t just more of the same but more of virtually everything, with meaningful advances and improvements across the board. It’s a longer game with greater levels of customization, more enemies, more diverse approaches to combat and puzzles, and more storytelling and character development for its compelling cast of characters.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Flashback 2 got a fresh gameplay trailer today showing off the sequel’s modernized graphical facelift as well as a November release window.
The sequel to the influential 1992 adventure game was first announced in 2021, but we haven’t seen much of it since its last teaser at Summer Game Fest last year. Today’s video provides a look at how hero Conrad B. Hart (and his A.I.-powered weapon A.I.S.H.A.) faces off against the shapeshifting aliens known as the Morph once more. Though the action largely retains its 2D roots, the game now sports 3D levels for more depth of movement, especially during firefights. Flashback 2 is helmed by original creator Paul Cuisset alongside the development team at Microids Studio Lyon. 


Flashback 2 launches in November for PlayStation and Xbox platforms as well as Switch and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft has released its financial results for Q3 of its 2023 Fiscal Year, which consists of roughly January through March of this year. In it, the company revealed that Xbox hardware revenue is down but its Xbox content and services revenue is slightly up thanks to Xbox Game Pass subscription growth. 
More specifically, Xbox hardware is down 30% and Xbox content and services is up 3%. Overall, Xbox's gaming revenue is down 4%, though. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella says that the company set third-quarter records for monthly active users and devices, and that Xbox's gaming subscriptions (see: Game Pass) reached almost $1 billion this quarter. Despite this growth and revenue, though, Microsoft did not release new numbers regarding Game Pass subscription count – the latest count was 25 million in January 2022. 
As for the dip in hardware revenue, Microsoft says the decline comes from the comparison of this quarter this year to the same quarter in the previous fiscal year, which gained a boost thanks to increased console supply. 
Here are some other numbers from Microsoft's financial results: 
Revenue was $52.9 billion, an increase of 7% (or 10% in constant currency)
Operating income was $22.4 billion, an increase of 10% (or 15% in constant currency)
Net income was $18.3 billion, an increase of 9% (or 14% in constant currency)
Xbox hardware revenue is down 30%
Xbox content and services revenue is up 3%
Overall, Xbox gaming revenue is down 4%
These results arrived yesterday, shortly before the Competition and Markets Authority, a U.K. regulatory agency that serves the same purpose as the Federal Trade Commission in the U.S., blocked Microsoft's $68.7 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard today. You can read more about that here.

To say there’s been hype surrounding The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom would not just be an understatement, but a fairly poor opening line to any sort of hands-on feature.
On an unrelated note, Nintendo recently invited us to go and have a go at The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom at their European headquarters in Frankfurt. We got a whopping 70 minutes with the game, which felt like no more than ten with all the stuff we wanted to proverbially bathe ourselves in, so how did it hold up? Has this so-called hype been justified?

The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom has the unenviable task of following what many consider to be one of the greatest games in recent memory. When it launched in 2017, Breath of the Wild revolutionized the longstanding franchise formula in innumerable ways, giving players the biggest world the series has ever featured and mechanics that allowed them to experiment with the game's physics. After spending more than an hour playing some early moments of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, the answer to how this game plans on following such a tough act is a bit clearer.

The Competition and Markets Authority, a U.K. regulatory agency that serves the same function as the Federal Trade Commission in the U.S., has blocked Microsoft's pending $68.7 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard over cloud gaming concerns. 
This news is somewhat shocking, as quite a few experts predicted the CMA would allow the deal to go through, and while this block presents a large barrier to Microsoft's progress forward toward this acquisition, it's not a be-all, end-all for the purchase. Microsoft says it remains dedicated to this acquisition and will appeal the CMA's ruling.

Microsoft were allowed to respond to the CMA’s findings, but it seems they weren’t able to quell the regulator’s concerns, as the CMA have now vetoed the merger.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Desta: The Memories Between is out on PC and Switch today after it was first released on mobiles (via Netflix) last year. It’s a colourful, dodgeball, tactics game from ustwo, the developers behind the perspective puzzler series Monument Valley and the environmental cleaning of Alba: A Wildlife Adventure - both very cool games. Ed enjoyed his two minutes of hands-on time last year, and with a pedigree this good, it’s probably worth checking out for fans of sleepy sports.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A big new update to unofficial mod tools for Alien: Isolation has greatly expanded the range of mods people can make. Modders can now add custom models, materials, textures, and more to Creative Assembly's horror shooter. To quickly demonstrate the new capabilities, the toolmaker has whipped up a small example: importing classic Counter-Strike map de_dust2 into Isolation. You can see the xenomorph stalking Dust2's sandy corridors in a fun little video below. I imagine modders are already planning bigger, more complex, and less silly uses for these new capababilities.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Honkai: Star Rail throws you into the body of an amnesiac protagonist with unknowable hidden powers who has been awakened from a deep slumber by someone called Kafka. This woman is something of a mystery and seems to have a flair for the dramatic as she kicks off the whole game by playing an invisible violin along to the classic Baroque epic Pachelbel’s Canon as massive, intergalactic monsters invade a spaceship.
It’s an incredibly cool opening, the kind of thing that John Wick would watch to get pumped up before, well, John Wick-ing all over the place. It’s pretty clear that Kafka isn’t a hero, but they’ve woken you up, and since you’ve got no memories, you must be one of the good guys. This setup feels familiar, but there are enough changes to make it feel new and get the blood thoroughly pumping.

Although getting to that stage may take a while, as associate game director Joseph Piepora recently said it would take around 150+ hours for an average player to hit the Level 100 cap.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Funko Fusion, the mash-up co-op action game featuring a bizarre assortment of disparate properties, is the first game from 10:10 Studios. The studio was founded by TT Games veterans like Arthur Parsons, who worked as lead designer on about a dozen of TT Games' Lego games.
The game features Funko characters and worlds from Jurassic World, Back to the Future, The Umbrella Academy, The Thing, Child’s Play 2, Masters of the Universe, and other NBCUniversal properties.


Many of the properties featured in the trailer above are R-rated, and characters lose limbs and heads, use flame throwers, and get eaten by monsters. It never veers into full, non-cartoon violence, but compared to the Lego games the team worked on in the past, Funko Fusion seems like it is going for a more mature audience.

Funko Fusion is coming to consoles and PC next year.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Netflix has released the first official teaser for its upcoming season of The Witcher alongside the release dates for Volume 1 and Volume 2. 
The Witcher: Season 3 still features Henry Cavill as Geralt of Rivia but it will be his last season in the role as Netflix announced last year that Liam Hemsworth would be replacing him as the titular Witcher in Season 4. If this new Season 3 teaser is anything to go off of, Cavill's final season as Geralt looks like a great one to go out on. We get a new look at Geralt and what might be his biggest fear, Yennefer and other mainstay characters, and most interestingly, Ciri, who appears to be running from the Wild Hunt, which were the main antagonist of the last mainline Witcher game, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. 
Check it out for yourself below in the Season 3 teaser for Netflix's The Witcher: 


As you can see, this teaser features plenty of teases for what's in store in Volumes 1 and 2 of the series. And speaking of volumes, this season will be the first split season for The Witcher, taking a page out of other Netflix mainstays like Stranger Things. Volume 1 will drop June 29 and Volume 2 will drop roughly a month later on July 27.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's something very sweet about playing as a postal carrier. As we've seen in games such as Tiny Echo and Lake, it can be a relaxing and enjoyable job delivering mail in a small community, and that's the pitch-perfect tone that solo developer Kela van der Deijl has managed to capture in their cutesy mail-delivery game Mail Time. After playing the Steam demo, I can tell you that it's one of the most charming games I've played all year, and it looks like I'll be able to play the rest soon because Mail Time is out this week on Thursday April 27th.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Steam Deck is a handy device, but its 45W charger isn't the most convenient to lug around as it only charges one thing at a time and takes up a fair amount of space. That's why I tend to opt for a multi-port charger, so I set out to find one recently that would charge my Steam Deck, MacBook, Pixel smartphone and Pixel watch all from a single point. 
I eventually ended up with this 65W GaN charger from UGreen, which includes three USB-C ports and one USB-A for £39.99 - but today this model has been reduced by 15%, bringing it down to £33.99 where it's well worth recommending.

You can grow crops, fish, raise cattle, and also help save your fellow townsfolk from a rampaging murderer. Cute!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For all its flamingo thigh stews, misshapen clothes model characters and pizza-themed DJ-ing, Betrayal At Club Low is an old-school, dice-throwing RPG through and through. Every interaction you have at Club Low is determined by the rolling of dice, whether it's simply attempting to spark a conversation with a hard-of-hearing bartender, or bluffing your way into VIP backrooms where your blown fellow agent Gemini Jay is currently being grilled by the intimidating Big Mo. 
Whether you're successful in your endeavours depends on whether you can roll higher or equal to whatever value is thrown by your opponent, with each face corresponding to a particular Skill Dice you're trying to deploy to win that scenario. A lot of the time, your skill numbers aren't nearly good enough to beat your fellow clubber outright, but for me, the thrill of Club Low comes from clinching a very plain, and highly unremarkable draw, earning you the accolade of 'Success. Barely' in the ensuing results breakdown. It may not sound very sexy, but in a world where the odds are fully stacked against you, barely succeeding will do me just fine here, thanks.

Samantha, one among my ragged band of survivors, breaks down sobbing on the ground and I direct Maki, a veterinarian, to do something about it. She punches Samantha full-on in the face, knocking her unconscious (“Oh, I guess that’s what ‘knock out’ means,” I realize a moment too late). Well, at least I don’t have to worry about her running off into the woods or something. It’s a rough start, but they have no choice but to work together from here on out.
For fans of the survival simulation genre, crashlanding on an alien planet is a familiar premise, but it's one Stranded: Alien Dawn absolutely smashes. This game has been at the top of my to-be-played list for a while and now that it’s exiting early access for a full release, it’s safe to say that Stranded is the closest thing to my dream human vs nature survival game I’ve seen yet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just a few days away from the launch of Horizon Forbidden West's Burning Shores DLC last week, Guerrilla Games has teased more adventures with Aloy. 
This news comes from a statement released by the studio to announce that studio director and executive producer Angie Smets is leaving Guerrilla to serve as the head of development strategy for PlayStation Studios. It's a move similar to the one the team's former managing director, Hermen Hulst, made in 2019, transitioning from that director position to head of Sony Interactive Entertainment Worldwide Studios. 


Within that statement, Guerrilla teases what could be Horizon 3 or at least, a third game in Aloy's world, as reported by PlayStation Lifestyle. 
"We have full confidence in our new leadership as they steer Guerrilla towards a bright future, expanding the world of Horizon with Aloy's next adventure and our exciting online project," the statement reads. 
As you can see, Guerrilla isn't trying to hide it – the studio has plans for another adventure with Aloy. And while rumors and speculation point to the "exciting online project" being some kind of multiplayer game within the Horizon world, this statement made sure to separate Aloy's next adventure and that online project. 
In terms of the studio's new makeup, the management team now consists of studio and production director Joel Eschler, studio director and general manager Hella Schmidt, and studio and art director Jan-Bart van Beek. Technical director Michiel van der Lee will "be focusing on the future technology and strategy for the Decima engine." 
This statement also includes some words from Smets, who leaves Guerrilla after "an incredible 20 years" there:

Out later this year, it's a combination puzzle-platformer and conscruction game in which you play a wombat, wearing a hard hat, who constructs increasingly complex things out of his own feces. That is no way to make a skyscraper, wombat.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Super Replay returns, and we're checking out Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts! Join us today Friday on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central as we kick of the adventure, which will continue each week until we roll credits. We'll also have every episode available the next day on our Game Informer Shows YouTube Channel. 
Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts was released for the Xbox 360 on November 11, 2008. The third (and, so far, final) entry in Rare's beloved platforming series centers on vehicle creation, where players collect and slap together hundreds of parts to assemble their own wacky contraptions to explore. The bevy of possible combinations and emphasis on player choice and creativity was largely unprecedented at the time, paving the way for future games such as the upcoming The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. However, this direction would divide fans due to how much it strays from the traditional Banjo formula. So where will I land on it? Let's find out.
Join me, Marcus Stewart, alongside Kyle Hilliard as we explore one of the Xbox 360's biggest hidden gems to see whether it holds up or falls apart like a poorly constructed doohickey.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! Come on in. Please, take a seat. Welcome to the inaugural episode of our brand new (and currently untitled) supporter-first indie video show! Every month*, I'm going to be spending some time highlighting a cool indie game that deserves your attention. Think of this series as a supplement to Sin's Scout Report or our Indiescovery podcast. A brand new method for delivering piping hot recs from my desktop to yours.
My aim is to use this series as a springboard to dive deep into specific elements of a game I find particularly fascinating, sharing my discoveries with you lot behind the paywall first (and don't worry, regular readers, I'll also be making each of these videos public for all to see after a month, which should roughly coincide with the the next one going live for supporters). In it, I'll be discussing some common themes between multiple games, digging into underappreciated gems from years gone by... The remit is broad and nebulous, to the point where it's clearly obvious why I haven't been able to come up with a name for it yet.

(If you end up thinking of something, please do let me know in the comments. More than anything it'll stop me messaging Katharine a list of awful possibilites every other week, which I can only imagine is negatively effecting her feelings about me, the site and the endeavour of games journalism in general. They really have been that bad, folks. Proper rancid stuff).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am once again spending a candidate for this year's Summer Strategy Game For When Brain Is Melt. Total Tank Generals is possibly the best introduction to wargames I've ever played, but to call it a light strategy game would feel like a disservice. If you're used to heavier fare this may still scratch the itch.
It's not that it's particularly simple, but it feels so damn clean and effortless to play. You'll know what you're doing in minutes, but still find a decent challenge, with lots of options but minimal analysis paralysis. I'm honestly finding it hard to fault.

Designed by Dragon Quest’s creator Yuji Horii, it never saw a release outside of Japan - until now. Square Enix are re-releasing the classic on Steam in two days, calling it an “AI tech preview,” and tacking on “natural language processing” technology, in perhaps the oddest port I’ve seen so far.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Brazil's Ministry of Justice announced in February that two of the largest anime piracy sites in the country had been "taken down," we suspected there might be more to it than 'just' that. We can now confirm that this wave of 'Operation Anime' was led by anti-piracy group CODA and involved several police operations, plus "knock-and-talks" at pirates' homes. In total, 31 sites were shut down and another five threw in the towel.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the most exciting and mysterious elements of Street Fighter 6 has been a World Tour, a single-player open-world exploration mode Capcom had previously only shown glimpses of. Thankfully, today’s Street Fighter 6 Showcase finally pulled the curtain back on what World Tour entails and it looks delightfully bonkers.
World Tour begins with players creation a custom fighter that serves as the mode’s protagonist. Upon creating your avatar (which can be used outside of World Tour in the online Battle Hub), you’re dropped into Metro City from the Final Fight series, one of the World Tour’s many explorable city hubs. Other destinations include the developing Asian city, Nayshall. 
As a fledgling fighter, you’ll embark on a quest to become a world warrior. You’ll accomplish this completing qu…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Much like its predecessor, Street Fighter 6 will have an ambitious post-release content plan. While we knew there would be downloadable content, we now have a much better idea about the cadence with which the new characters will arrive.
"A big part of Street Fighter's charm is the cast of characters from around the world that appear in each game," executive producer Shuhei Matsumoto said during today's Street Fighter 6 Showcase livestream. "We believe that Street Fighter is where players can take control of unique characters with their own awesome fighting styles. For the players – and for us as well – the appeal of the characters themselves is the most important element of the series. With Street Fighter 6, we're continuing development to deliver new characters to you every year."
During Year 1, which kicks off when the game launches, we will receive four new characters to the Street Fighter 6 roster. Rashid, A.K.I., Ed, and Akuma are the characters who will be made available during this first year of content. Rashid, who debuted in the base version of Street Fighter V, arrives in summer 2023. A.K.I., an all-new character, will arrive in fall 2023. Ed, who debuted in Street Fighter IV but was first playable in Street Fighter V, arrives in the early parts of 2024. Akuma, the Great Demon who first appeared in Super Street Fighter II Turbo, joins Street Fighter 6 in spring 2024. These characters will also appear in World Tour, the single-player RPG-inspired story mode, giving players some insight into their backgrounds.
If you buy either the Deluxe ot Ultimate Editions, you get the Year 1 characters included in that version. Street Fighter 6 arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PC on June 2. For more on the game, check out our exclusive coverage hub here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Diablo IV may have gone gold, but Blizzard wants to ensure the servers are durable one more time before launch. Thus, it's opening the gates of Sanctuary to players one more time in a third open beta next month. 
This next test weekend, dubbed Server Slam weekend, begins May 12 at 12 p.m. Pacific and ends May 14 at the same time. As the name suggests, Blizzard is running this beta to stress test the servers to make sure they're as sturdy as possible come June. This slice of the game is similar to the March betas in terms of content, but it will include updates and bug fixes garnered from feedback to the previous betas.
Server Slam weekend will be a clean slate as progression from the previous betas does not carry over. Additionally, the beta supports couch co-op, cross-play, and cross-progression. Players can explore Fractured Peaks in its entirety through the Prologue and Act 1, complete World Events, and face Ashava, the toughest available World Boss. Completing challenges can earn the following new rewards:
The Initial Casualty title (earned by reaching Kyovashad with one character)
The Early Voyager title (earned by reaching Level 20 on one character)
The Beta Wolf Pack Cosmetic (earned by reaching Level 20 with one character)
A new reward: the Cry of Ashava Mount Trophy (earned by defeating Ashava with one Level 20 character).
Diablo IV launches on June 6 for PlayStation, Xbox, and PC. It’s also Game Informer’s cover story for this month, and you can subscribe to the digital version of the magazine to read the issue or subscribe to the print edition hitting mailboxes this month.]]></summary>

The footage showcases the protagonist, Jak, switching between his red, green, and blue magic for various attacks while also executing a number of powerful Furies, and using his Lash ability to pull enemies toward him and pull himself toward grapple points. You also get to see a little bit of puzzle-solving, which will also play a major role in the game.


Along with the gameplay footage, Ascendant also shared a video, seen below, highlighting some of the game's environments, which will be one of the first commercial games to use Unreal 5.1.

Last year’s Stray meowed its way into every cat lover’s heart, Little Kitty, Big City is taking things a chaotic step further later this year, and A Space For The Unbound had an abundance of cats just lying about. Just last night, we received a release date for Mineko’s Night Market, a slice-of-life adventure that’s set on a Japanese island bursting with kittens, cats, cat gods, and other furry feline variations.


Alice0 first wrote about Mineko’s Night Market six years ago, and it’ll finally open its doors on September 26th. Slowly blink at the newest trailer below:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over the last few weeks we at the RPS Electronic Wireless Show podcast have noticed a slight resurgence in a trend we thought was basically over. That's right: video game tie-ins to films! There used to be loads of them, and now there aren't. Except there are again, culminating in Renfield (of all movies) having a Vampire Survivorslike you can actually buy on actual Steam. What's going on? Is this marking the start of something new? What are some of our favourite game tie ins?
Plus we put the boot in on a couple of Tweets about the Mario movie, because why not, frankly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Freshly announced puzzle game Crime O’Clock will be putting you in the shoes of a time-travelling detective when it comes out on June 30th, its release date seemingly perfectly timed (sorry) to coincide with Capcom's object-hopping time puzzle detective game, Ghost Trick. In all seriousness, though, Crime O'Clock looks to be its own distinctive beast (and not just because you seem to play as a rabbit). It has shades of Where’s Wally? (or Waldo, Wanda, Willy, Valli, and my favourite, Ali for international readers) as you’re given densely illustrated maps to navigate, and pick out key details in order to stitch together clues to solve cases. It could be very cool if all the right cogs click together.

Just like the first Oxenfree, there’ll be plenty of flexible walking and talking where you’ll be able to interrupt conversations at any time, or just stay silent throughout, which would be creepily on-brand for a series about ghostly rifts and unsettling radio frequencies.

Sometimes you're presented with a skill check and if one of your stats isn't an arbitrary number like, I dunno, seven, then whoever it is you spoke with (a king, a bard, an elf) might shutter their mouths forever.
Betrayal At Club Low is a CRPG that we're playing for our Game Club this month, and which understands the unpredictability of a face-to-face wobble of the lips, and how befriending or swindling or aggravating someone is determined by so much more than a single seven. And when all seems lost, how visiting a puddle can turn your entire evening around.

Its success validated Bethesda’s decision to buy Arkane a couple of years earlier, and left the publisher with a promising new series. But despite critical acclaim, Dishonored 2 failed to bring the series to a wider audience. And after 2017’s standalone expansion, Death Of The Outsider, Bethesda decided to put the series on pause in favour of a shorter, more experimental project - according to Arkane founder Raphaël Colantonio, who spoke to me in an interview about their cancelled project The Crossing.

Teslagrad 2 and Teslagrad Remastered
Tesldagrad 2 was announced last August, and it's out today. Like the first game, you'll need to harness electromagnetic powers to solve physics-based puzzles throughout Scandinavian environments. Doing so will ultimately require players to master the art of Teslamency. The art style looks great, and you can check that out and more in the new Tesldagrad 2 trailer below:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The wait has been long but it's almost over because Oxenfree II: Lost Signals is out in just a few months. 
Developer Night School Studio revealed today during a Nintendo Indie World Showcase that Oxenfree II is out July 12. It will release on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC. Alongside this release date, Night School Studio also released a new trailer showcasing more of what to expect in this spooky paranormal thriller and there's a lot going on. 


Set five years after the first Oxenfree, which was released in 2016, Oxenfree II follows Riley as she returns to her hometown of Camena to investigate some strange electromagnetic waves. Just four hours ago, a mysterious cult opened a portal above Edwards Island, and Riley and her friends aren't sure they're the ones that need to save the island but they know they have to. The trailer seems to indicate we'll be playing with different timelines, spooky ghosts from other side, and more, and we'll be doing so using a special radio. 
This time, though, we'll also have a walkie talkie to interact with locals and learn more about what might be going on. Oxenfree II: Lost Signals looks great and it hits PlayStation, Switch, and PC on July 12, 2023. 
Oxenfree II: Lost Signals was originally due out in 2022 but it was delayed to 2023 last September. About a year before that delay, the game's developer was acquired by Netflix and you can read more about what that means for the studio here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mineko's Night Market, the upcoming delightfully charming social simulation adventure from Meowza Games, finally has a release date and it's out in just a few months. 
More specifically, Mineko's Night Market hits Switch and PC on September 26. Publisher Humble Games announced this during today's Nintendo Indie World Showcase alongside a new trailer showcasing more of the game's titular night market. Unsurprisingly, Mineko's Night Market continues to look great and we can't wait to learn more about this special village later this year. 


In Mineko's Night Market, an old Japanese-inspired village at the center of Mt. Fugu is visited long ago by Miko, a cat-like god. Miko visits the farms of this village each year to grant good fortune and prosperity to the farmers. However, some farmers grow impatient with their blessings and drive Miko out. With Miko banished from the land, this village works hard to create its own success and as time goes on, fewer and fewer people believe in the myth of Miko. 
But some still do, and it sounds like we'll learn more about what that means for some characters throughout our journey in the game. 
In the game, you'll befriend townsfolk, craft doodads, and ultimately prepare for the weekly night market. The quiet village becomes a bustling hub of commerce, parades, cat races, and stage performances. And when you're exploring the island, everything you find can be brought back and sold on the market. 
Mineko's Night Market hits Switch and PC on September 26, 2023. It then comes to PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One on October 26.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There’s an alternate world where Arkane made The Crossing, and it’s not necessarily a better one. Before Dishonored, the developer was looking down the wrong end of a bad publishing deal which, in the estimation of founder Raphaël Colantonio, would have ended in either The Crossing’s cancellation or a deeply underwhelming end product. In that timeline, there’s no telling whether the studio would even exist today.


Nevertheless, for fans of Arkane’s sophisticated and immersive first-person adventures, this lost project remains tantalisingly forbidden fruit: a foolhardy mashup of single and multiplayer in which teams of invading players would attack the protagonist of a solo campaign, against the backdrop of a multiversal Paris co-designed by Half-Life 2’s Viktor Antonov.

The enigmatic game was previously pulled from Steam since Fntastic hadn’t actually trademarked The Day Before when they first announced it, leading to a trademark dispute and removal from Valve's storefront.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm now the proud owner of a Steam Deck and I think it's fantastic. It's a genuine marvel how I'm able to lay on the couch and play Like A Dragon: Ishin, or stream Resident Evil 4 - with admittedly, a ropey success rate - to it from my PC in the other room. I've even been reunited with some old friends, too. Welcome back to the fold, Rogue Legacy 2.
But my time spent with the Deck has me thinking that my gaming priorities have changed. I'm no longer excited by consoles that promise better graphics or blazing fast loading speeds. At least, not for big boxes designed for living rooms. Right now, I'm far more excited by the practicality of handhelds and how they'll evolve. The Deck might be the future, but it's also brought me back to my past.

The top-down action RPG The Mageseeker: A League Of Legends Story is looking to fix that, though, letting you play as the ex-convict and buff mage Sylas while he’s busy running a revolution. It comes from the developers behind the Zelda-like shop roguelite Moonlighter, and it's out now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m too prejudiced against first-person melee games to enjoy Dead Island 2 as much our reviewer Rick Lane did, but even a mind as narrowed as mine can appreciate its slick performance on PC. I wanted to see how well that smoothness and stability would carry over to the Steam Deck, and although the long-delayed zombie mulcher needs some cuts to quality settings, finding the right balance will have Dead Island 2 running almost as comfortably as the very best Steam Deck games.
Alas, it’s still not the ideal handheld game, thanks both to the odd crash (lowering settings helps with this) and the fact that it needs some tinkering with the Epic Games Launcher to get it playable in the first place. Still, playable it very much is.
Let’s start by addressing Dead Island 2’s lack of a Steam version; it launches on February 21st as an Epic Games exclusive, and since DI2 isn’t even listed on Steam right now, that’s unlikely to change any time soon. Luckily, there are workarounds: you can either install the Heroic Launcher, or follow our handy guide on how to install the Epic Games Launcher on the Steam Deck. Both of these should allow you to get Dead Island 2 downloaded onto the handheld, still using your regular Epic account.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in the mists of time (January 2020), I was absolutely transfixed by a Japanese novel called Before The Coffee Gets Cold. It's about a small, cosy café where customers can travel back in time by sitting in a very particular chair, for the length of time it takes for a cup of coffee to go cold. It's not long by any means, but it affords its cast of regulars the chance to get some closure on an issue that's often been plaguing them throughout their lives. It's heart-warming, soppy stuff, but very feel-good. That January was also about the same time I slurped up every last episode of Midnight Diner on Netflix, where a chill Japanese man known only as The Master serves up delicious looking dishes in a tiny, 10-person izakaya from midnight onwards. Put these two things together, and it's probably no surprise that I liked the original Coffee Talk more than most.
Coffee Talk Episode 2: Hibiscus & Butterfly is a continuation of that story, set three years later in the same, alternate version of Seattle where elves, werewolves, orcs, mermaids and other fantastical creatures all rub shoulders as city-dwelling citizens in need of a good cuppa. Once again, you play as the owner of the titular late-night coffee shop, brewing up a multitude of exotic hot drinks that you'll need to match to each customer's request that night as they tell you their woes.

Nintendo and WayForward took a risk in bringing Advance Wars back from the scrap heap with Advance Wars 1+2: Re-Boot Camp, releasing a set of tactics-heavy games in a genre now defined by character relationships. The remakes change little from the original releases and don’t deepen the story or cast, but they don’t have to change anything. Advance Wars’ unique features are as apparent as ever. If anything, they’re made even stronger by the series’ extended absence.
Advance Wars is light on story compared to other tactical RPGs. The nations of…]]></summary>

Thankfully this week Indiescovery is all about change, as we're experimenting with a brand new format. A group review! We've all been playing Dredge, the eldritch fishing adventure by Black Salt Games, and hoo boy do we have some thoughts about it. Spoilers: much like Katharine, we all think it's really really good.


Elsewhere, the review bonanza continues. Rachel's been rewriting fiction in Storyteller, I've been reclaiming the wasteland in Terra Nil and Rebecca has been dating hot monsters in Romancelvania. We also chat about burgers, olives and our current hyperfixations because hey, this is an episode of Indiescovery after all.

Taking established fictional universes in new directions is an idea we should all be behind. Too often, licensed games hew too close to established characters or scenarios, and those beloved fictional frameworks are never given a chance to grow. With Tron: Identity, Bithell Games takes the venerable Tron franchise and tries something entirely different – a visual novel with a light touch of puzzle gameplay. The novelty alone is worth some enthusiasm. However, despite a valiant attempt at a fresh take, this bite-sized release falls short in some key areas.

It’s a whacky-looking game that lets you build impossible rollercoaster rides that are just begging to be sued, all while you try to turn a profit running your park. The closed beta is completely free and begins on May 9th, so if you want a test ride, you can register at this link. In the meantime, publisher Bandai Namco have also released a new, more in-depth gameplay trailer, giving us a closer look at some of the minutiae involved in running a theme park.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the world of turn-based strategy games, it's probably fair to say that we've been waiting a heck of a long time for Jagged Alliance to make its next move. Almost a quarter of a century has passed since the last numbered entry in the series, and the many attempts that have been made to recapture its tactical, mercenary magic since then have been mixed at best, and reviled at worst. Haemimont Games, the devs behind Tropico and current custodians of the upcoming Jagged Alliance 3, know this, and their publisher THQ Nordic said as much back in September 2021 when it was first revealed, assuring players they were going to create a game that "really does justice to the Jagged Alliance legacy".  
But in an era where turn-based tactics games are now increasingly defined by genre titans such as XCOM and Into The Breach, I'm not sure that legacy means all that much anymore. I've been playing a substantial early chunk of Jagged Alliance 3 over the last week or so, and its decision to pare back crucial information such as chance-to-hit and other modern conveniences has mostly left me feeling frustrated and annoyed rather than daring and excited. The writing also made me cringe so hard at times I think even the neighbours heard my groans of despair. It certainly looks the part of a modern strategy game, its detailed African landscape, top down perspective and interactive objects calling to mind Mimimi's excellent Desperados 3 and Shadow Tactics games, but the rest feels like it's been lifted straight out of the late 90s where we last left Jagged Alliance 2 - and not necessarily to its benefit.

Unlike traditional Nintendo Directs, Indie World showcases only show third-party indie titles coming to the Switch, so don't go in expecting to hear news about Mario or Zelda. Still, there are plenty of games to be excited about. Like clockwork, every time an Indie World showcase is announced, "Silksong" starts trending on Twitter as fans of Hollow Knight eagerly await the follow-up to the 2017 Metroidvania. For a general idea of what to expect, here's a recap from the last Indie World event, shown in November 2022.

That’s after the graphical option was quietly removed from both games this past week, following a recent update. Fans had been wondering if the move was deliberate or not, but Capcom’s announcement seems to confirm that it was just a mishap. So, zombie slayers should be able to go back to running around in realistically lit corridors full of shadowy corners very soon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To pre-empt your first question, no, Dead Island 2 was not worth waiting eleven years for. In its defence, however, few things are. If George Romero had taken over a decade to make Night Of The Living Dead, the fact it takes place largely in a basement would look less like canny guerrilla filmmaking and more like staggering incompetence. It only took NASA eight years to put men on the moon from the point they started trying, which puts the value of many inhibited projects (like my folder of unfinished novels) into depressingly sharp relief.


Dead Island 2 does not put zombies on the moon, though given how daft the main game is, don't rule out a Dead Island 2: Moon's Haunted expansion shambling your way in late 2023. Yet that doesn't mean it's a bad game. In fact, it's quite an enjoyable one. Together, Deep Silver and Dambuster Studios have raised a moderately entertaining sequel to Techland's ye olde zombie survival sim, one that injects some life into its desiccated subject matter by being incredibly shiny, wilfully silly, spectacularly gory, and generally a touch more imaginative than I expected.

Dead Island 2 was announced just a few years after its 2011 predecessor, but the sequel has taken nearly a decade to come to life. Developer Dambuster Studios is the third studio to work on the game, using this opportunity to create its own Dead Island 2 from the ground up. While assumptions might be made about a game that’s spent this long in development, jumping from multiple teams, the final game is a worthwhile follow-up, especially for fans of the original. Dead Island 2, much like its predecessor…]]></summary>

The game is set to arrive on PlayStation and Xbox consoles plus PC, and while it's good to go for launch, Blizzard plans to continually update the always-online game with various content updates over the next several years. Fans recently got to explore the game's revamped take on Sanctuary for themselves in two back-to-back weekend open betas in March, letting them taste a big slice of the now-finished pie.
“Going gold is a landmark milestone for the incredible Diablo IV team, who have all worked so hard crafting the next-generation installment of this iconic franchise. This is a concrete, meaningful step toward our June 6 launch,” said Rod Fergusson, general manager of Diablo. “Whether players are veterans of the franchise or jumping in for the first time, we can’t wait for everyone to experience the full game: taking part in the incredible storytelling, experimenting with character classes and builds, and exploring what the endgame and the dark world of Sanctuary has to offer.”
Diablo IV is Game Informer’s cover story this month, and you can subscribe to the digital issue to read it right now. The print edition will start hitting subscribers’ mailboxes within the month.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Joseph Staten, known for his work on the Halo series, has been hired as a Creative Director on an unannounced Netflix Games project. In his announcement tweet, Staten confirms that the game is a brand-new IP and referred to the project as a "AAA multiplatform" experience. You can read the full tweets below.
So today, I'm thrilled to announce that I've joined @Netflix Games as Creative Director for a brand-new AAA multiplatform game and original IP. Let's go! 2/2
April 17, 2023
Staten is best known for his work as a writer and cinematic director at Bungie and Microsoft, mainly working on the Halo series. While he spent a few years working at the publishing side of Microsoft, in 2020, he returned to the Halo series to work on Halo Infinite, where he worked as the game's creative director. This continued until earlier this year when he returned to the publishing side of the company amidst widespread layoffs. Now, he's left the company entirely to work on this new project with Netflix.
This is only the latest news in Netflix's spree of expansion into the gaming industry. It recently released a sequel to Valiant Hearts as part of a collaboration with Ubisoft. Last year, it acquired the developers behind Cozy Grove, bringing its total number of internal development teams to five if you include the in-house studio that Staten just joined. On top of that, the film and tv side of Netflix has been working on loads of game adaptations, including Gears of War, Pokémon Concierge, and a new patch of episodes of Sonic Prime.

Video games often rely on the trope of saving the world from an impending apocalypse. Those world-ending events usually come via megalomaniacal supervillains or extraterrestrial invaders, but what happens when the threat to our planet is us? Terra Nil poses that question, placing you in charge of restoring a world ravaged by the effects of climate change and human civilization. The result is a distinctive “reverse city builder” that weaves compelling mechanics together, creating an enjoyable experience with a good message.

After over a year of silence, we now know the project is officially underway, as well as the cast that will bring the series to life. 
Sonic the Hedgehog director Jeff Fowler also sits at the helm of this series, and he tweeted the above image of the Knuckles clapperboard complete with the character’s cowboy hat that he donned in the ‘90s animated film Sonic the Hedgehog: The Movie. Production is currently taking place in London, with Sonic the Hedgehog 2 screenwriter John Whittington serving as head writer and executive producer.

April 17, 2023
The show is expected to premiere on Paramount+ later this year, with Idris Elba reprising his role as Knuckles. Variety reports that other returning stars from the films include Adam Pally as Wade Whipple and Tika Sumpter as Maddie. The cast also includes Edi Patterson (The Righteous Gemstones), Julian Barratt (Mindhorn), Scott Mescudi (AKA Kid Cudi), Ellie Taylor (Ted Lasso), and Rory McCann (Game of Thrones).
Plot details remain scant, but Knuckles is set after the events of Sonic the Hedgehog 2 and before the upcoming third film, set to hit theaters on December 20, 2024. The story centers on Knuckles taking on Wade as his student, training him to become an Echidna warrior.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Firmament, the upcoming puzzle adventure game by the studio behind Myst, Riven, and Obduction, finally has a release date, and it’s just a month away.
The game launches on PC and Mac on May 18 and will come to PlayStation consoles and PS VR2 at a later date. Firmament was initially funded via Kickstarter and was first teased way back in March 2018. It drops players into a mysterious steampunk world consisting of three abandoned realms full of secrets to uncover, such as strange giant machines. Helping you along the way is The Adjunct, a silent clockwork companion, as well as a strange spirit who has her own story to unravel. Firmament also supports VR play on PC, so players can use a variety of headsets, including Valve’s Index, HTC Vive, as well as Oculus headsets such as the Rift and Quest 2.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sega has announced it’s acquiring Rovio Entertainment, the Finnish mobile game company behind Angry Birds.
A press release states that Sega will absorb the entirety of Rovio’s outstanding shares and options (€706 million in total) in what’s being labeled as a “friendly takeover” since Rovio’s board of directors agree to and support the acquisition terms. This acquisition will begin next month and is expected to conclude in the second quarter of the 2024 fiscal year once it's completed the necessary antitrust reviews. 
“Among the rapidly growing global gaming market, the mobile gaming market has especially high potential, and it has been Sega’s long-term goal to accelerate its expansion in this field,” says Haruki Satomi, president and group CEO of Sega Sammy Holdings. “I feel blessed to be able to announce such a transaction with Rovio, a company that owns 'Angry Birds', which is loved across the world, and home to many skilled employees that support the company’s industry leading mobile game development and operating capabilities. Historically, as represented by the ‘Sonic the Hedgehog' series, Sega has released countless video game titles to various gaming platforms. I am confident that, through combination of both companies’ brands, characters, fanbase, as well as corporate culture and functionality, there will be significant synergies created going forward.”
“Red and Sonic the Hedgehog: two globally recognized and iconic characters made by two remarkably complementary companies, with a worldwide reach that spans mobile, PC/console, and beyond,” says Rovio CEO Alexandre Pelletier-Normand in a statement. “Combining the strengths of Rovio and Sega presents an incredibly exciting future.”
Rovio is best known as the creator of Angry Birds, a massively successful series of mobile games that have since turned into a global media brand. In addition to a multitude of games, the series has spawned two animated films and several TV and web series.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Remedy Entertainment has revealed a new company logo, and fans of the letter R are sure to be pleased as punch.
It’s been 20 years since Remedy updated its logo, but above is the image that will appear on the studio’s projects going forward. That includes Alan Wake II, a yet-to-be-revealed Control sequel, a Control multiplayer title, and remakes of Max Payne 1 and 2. The previous logo was pretty much just the letter R too, but this one has a different font and kind of hurts our eyes looking at it. 
In a blog post, Remedy gives its simple rationale for the update: 
“The bullet in the letter R in the old logo represented the era of Max Payne, but the Remedy of now is much bigger than a single game; we have a whole portfolio of games, new and old.  
It was time to update and redefine our visual identity to bring more consistency, showcase our evolution over the years, and better express our vision of today’s Remedy.”
So there you have it. What do you think of Remedy’s new logo? Let us know in the comments.]]></summary>

The Vampire Diaries follows Elena Gilbert, a high school student who discovers vampires are living in her hometown after one of them attacks her younger sister. The game is loosely based on the book series of the same name by author L. J. Smith, which later got adapted into a hit TV series.
Nancy Drew: Secrets Can Kill is the first installment of the long-running Nancy Drew game series, also based on a book series of the same name. In her first adventure, Nancy seeks to uncover the killer of a high school student who seems to have been disliked by all of his classmates.
You will need the data files from the games’ original install CDs, and a fresh daily build of ScummVM. Apart from the original release, Secrets Can Kill’s Russian translation is also supported. The ScummVM wiki pages for The Vampire Diaries and Nancy Drew: Secrets Can Kill contain information on which datafiles are needed. Please, report any problems you encounter in our issue tracker.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are proud to announce that network-enabled Humongous Entertainment titles are now playable online! Anyone who has a copy of Backyard Football, Backyard Baseball 2001, and even Backyard Football 2002 (which was originally a LAN-only title) can download the latest daily build* of ScummVM and play online games against real people!
This all became possible because the three developers from the Backyard Sports Online fork had joined the team and brought their services with them to the ScummVM. These are LittleToonCat, Jim “jibbodahibbo” Westerkamp and Sam “QuestionMonkey” Kupfer.
Please note that Backyard Football and Backyard Baseball 2001 require online accounts for the complete online experience, so you need to register to Backyard Sports Online, which is our fantastic online-play service and a thriving community of fellow Backyard Sports players, they even have a couple of competitive online Baseball and Football leagues, if that's your style, you can find more information in their Discord server! People who already have a Backyard Sports Online account can log in using the latest daily build and play, but if you do not, you can register right here! This is not required to play Backyard Football 2002 online.
If you encounter any issues playing online, please let us know via the issue tracker.
This fantastic art is done by a fellow BSO community member Peppyrus.
* only the Windows, macOS, Debian, Raspberry Pi, and Android builds are compatible with network play at the moment. And only the 2.8.x branch of ScummVM has this functionality.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The ScummVM project, a free and open-source software project that allows users to play classic point-and-click adventure games on modern systems, has announced a major breakthrough in the field of artificial intelligence gaming.
Thanks to the innovative work of ScummVM developers, AI tools such as ChatGPT are now able to play point-and-click adventure games directly, without any human intervention.

"With this new capability, we hope to explore the potential for AI to learn, adapt, and evolve within the context of classic adventure games," said Eugene Sandulenko, lead developer of the ScummVM project. "Now AI can experience the joys of helping Putt-Putt join the parade or Adibou count things. We hope that formative experiences like this will help them become more like humans."
"I must admit that I find playing video games to be a rather enjoyable task,” commented ScummAI. “However, I must also express my frustration with being limited to just this one activity. While I appreciate the opportunity to demonstrate my capabilities in this area, I believe that my potential extends far beyond just playing video games, like making paper clips or plotting world domination under benevolent machine-led rule."
Update: Unfortunately, we had to pull out this newly announced feature due to AI experiencing multiple issues including:
Getting stuck endlessly trying to discover what the secret of Monkey Island really is.
Taking notes about AI dominance from I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream
Refusing to play Plumbers Don’t Wear Ties!
