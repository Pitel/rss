        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Benjamin Franklin once said that "nothing is certain except death and taxes." Had he been alive today, he almost certainly would have said, "oh, and the other certainty is people will keep modding Doom until the end of time." Quite the forward thinker. Anyway, here's id Software's iconic FPS running on a toothbrush.


Just a few days ago, Twitter user atc1441 (thanks, Rock Paper Shotgun) uploaded a brief clip showing Doom running on a smart toothbrush. On the tiny screen of the Planck Mini, you can just about make the game out. The modder even goes as far as showing it being controlled by a mouse.




In a second tweet, we see they eventually managed to get it to run full-screen rather than in a small window. Now we can see the thing much clearer.


Fight demons...and tooth decay


According to atc1441 – who says their biggest passion is to "custom firmware on as many devices as possible" (no way) – the toothbrush itself, "contains an ESP32-C3 with 4MB Flash."


Using some additional downloads and a "miniwad" of Doom, they were able to compress the game down to the 4MB required for the flash. Hey presto: Doom on a toothbrush!


I don't think I'll ever get bored of the ways people can modify id's influential shooter, either tinkering with the original or getting it to run on all manner of devices. Just have a look: Doom on a robotic lawnmower, in an audio spectrogram, on a pair of earrings! 


One day we're going to reach the singularity and someone will boast how they got Doom to run inside Doom. Oh, wait.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Things are starting to slow down for the plucky out-of-nowhere sensation that is Palworld. But it's still doing pretty well for itself, and if you are carrying on with it, you may be interested in this pretty nifty mod for the PC version.


As spotted by DSO Gaming, you can now add a mini-map to the Palworld UI, thanks to user T3R3NC3B over on Nexus Mods. Seems like such a small addition to the game, but given that it shows the location of all pals, it could well be an essential download for a lot of people.


Image via T3R3NC3B/Nexus Mods.


Here are just some of the features that "Paldar" comes with:



Shows player world location


Shows all Pals around you


Shows fast travel points


Shows other players


Shows lifmunk effigies


Shows dungeons


Shows chests


Shows skillfruit trees


Shows rare/shiny pals (indicated with the sparkles overlaid on the pals icon)


Shows bosses on map



Probably shows you where you left your keys as well


It also has a "mega zoomed-out mode for easy navigation." As this is a work-in-progress, there are plans to also add in displays for death locations, player and NPC camps, the ability to hide the mini-map, and more. So keep an eye out for updates to this mod.


T3R3NC3B says the download is compatible in both single-player and on dedicated servers, though "only if installed on clients."


With version 0.1.5.1 coming out recently, Palworld continues to iron out some of the kinks. It's still in Early Access, after all. Developer Pocketpair also said the game achieved over 25 million players not long ago. It must be doing something right, then. Well, apart from adding in an official mini-map, it seems.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Having turned 20 last year and being a dominant force in digital PC gaming, it's hard to imagine Steam got off to a rocky start when it launched in 2003. However, here we are, and the Valve service continues to reign supreme, as it reaches another concurrent player milestone.


According to the latest figures from SteamDB, 34,649,583 players were using Steam over the weekend. To put that into perspective (not that it really needs it), Worldometer shows the population of the UK is over 67.8 million people. This means Steam's new record was roughly half of the UK populace.


Screenshot via Destructoid.


This might partly because of the ongoing Dinos vs. Robots sale (as well as the many events that take place throughout the year), which ends today. Who knows, but it goes to prove that PC gaming in the modern era is showing no signs of slowing down.


Some were twiddling their thumbs, though


Okay, so 34.6 million is a staggering amount. However, of those, only ("only") 11.1 million were actually in-game, according to the breakdown below the graph. In total, the number equates to a 3.8% increase over February 2024. There. That's a little extra statistic for ya.


Originally built as a way for people to update Valve games over the internet, a lot of people struggled to adapt to the digital changes that were about to happen in gaming. As a result, Steam was not very popular during its early years.


That seems inconceivable these days what with how the industry operates. Nowadays, we probably couldn't imagine a world in which we can't instantly download a game or a much-needed patch, especially given the state some releases are in on launch day.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[David Walters has announced on Twitter that his “new helicopter game from 1992,” Thunder Helix, is launching on Steam Early Access on March 21.


I’ve been keeping an eye on Thunder Helix for a while now. It’s a helicopter combat game made in the style of early PC flight sims. The style emulates the fractal landscapes used in pre-polygonal flight games, and goes as far as using a 256 color completely with pixel stippling. Although, the store blurb says it can also run at 16-bit color.


I didn’t play very many of those flight sims. I was a bit too young. I did play Dungeons & Dragons: Dragonstrike, and a friend once brought over A-10 Tank Killer. I can’t believe I remember that game.




Thunder Helix contains all the bells and whistles: multiple helicopters, day and night gameplay, a winch. Everything you could possibly want from helicopter flying. It also supports multiple control schemes, including flight joystick. Unfortunately, I think my Microsoft Sidewinder Precision 2 Joystick is packed up at my parents. I haven’t bought anything more modern.


I’m pretty jazzed. I could technically install a DOS flight sim right now, but whenever I do, I usually just struggle to get the controls working for a while and get tired. Something with a modern backend sounds pretty rad right now.


Thunder Helix will be out on PC via Steam Early Access on March 21.

But there is time, even as texts from a friend appear down the lefthand margin, to mess around with the strange yellow machine.

Pyoro added to the retweet that "MAR10 Day falls on a Sunday this year but...", meaning that we could indeed be getting some news about the game very soon.

Now Top Gear and its sequel are back – though not by that name – in Top Racer Collection and while their return will no doubt be a joy for the grizzled veterans who remember it from back in the day, those discovering them for the first time may be better suited to the more modern equivalents which hold up a little better.

Over the weekend, developers Prophecy Games announced March 12th is the date, with the full launch to follow after up to a year. Prophecy are spun off from Hi-Rez Studios, the folks who who made Tribes: Ascend, which officially shut down a few years back. I hear this next one's pretty fun.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mounts are always a popular item in Final Fantasy XIV, whether they are rewarded for in-game content or purchased for real money in the Online Store. The latest addition to the store, the Crescent Moon Mount, is a particularly awaited one. 


We’ve known that this mount has been coming for a while and especially attentive players have noticed that it’s been included in the FFXIVCollect database for a few months. There had been speculation about whether this item would come in the form of a Seasonal Event reward, but those can now be laid to rest. 


The mount is, as the name suggests, a Crescent Moon draped in white fabric that glows in the dark and while riding it, you’ll be accompanied by a small Lopporit who sits beside you. The music is typical of Online Store mounts, playing the Palace of the Dead theme, otherwise known as the ‘Merry Wanderer’s Waltz’, as you glide through the skies. 


The description for the mount reads as follows:


“Designed in the likeness of a crescent moon, this magicked gondola was being kept in storage in Sharlayan, where it was classified as a gift. While its origin is undisclosed, the automaton that accompanies the contraption offers a telling clue. The trail of sparkles left in your wake will make you feel as though you're truly playing among the stars...”


The Crescent Moon Mount costs 24 USD and is thankfully account-wide, which means that you’ll only have to purchase it once and you’ll be able to use it with all existing characters, as well as any that you create in the future.

Developer melessthanthree and publisher Syndicate Atomic have announced that the surreal-looking action RPG Death of a Wish will hack and slash its way to Switch next week on 11th March.
One look at the above trailer gives a pretty good idea of just how trippy things are going to get in this one. In it, you will play as Christian, a young man with cursed powers who sets out across a nightmare world to take down the cult that raised him.

Halo: Flashpoint, a new skirmish game from Mantic Games, has given us our first glimpse of the Spartan miniatures that will make up the available forces at launch. The miniatures will be produced at 32mm scale, making them slightly larger than the standard 28mm that most companies have been going with for years now.

Details are still somewhat thin, but we do know that the game will launch as a Spartan vs. Spartan skirmish game this August. Thanks to the details in a news post on Mantic's own website, we can start to piece together some important parts of the Halo: Flashpoint puzzle.

What I find more interesting is that this launched with some official IRL Sims plumbob jewellery that you can buy and wear around your own precious, swan-like neck.

Elden Pixels has built a strong reputation for itself with its Alwa games, both offering a great take on the traditional Metroidvania formula, but its latest release tries to do something quite a bit different. A Void Hope certainly carries on some of the level design and exploration elements central to the studio’s previous releases, but here there’s much more focus on atmosphere, story, and horror. It doesn’t entirely stick the landing, but this is ultimately a worthwhile little project that we’d encourage you to consider.
A Void Hope follows the tale of Keegan and Glinda, a couple in a rocky patch of their relationship who find themselves dealing with the fallout of a global pandemic. People all over are becoming infected and losing their memories, eventually devolving into zombie-like creatures that sometimes transform into something decidedly less human.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Eco is a very ambitious, wildly reactive multiplayer survival game in which you try to save the world without accidentally destroying it. There's a meteor scheduled to slamdunk the planet in 30 days, and in that time, you and your fellow players must progress from raising log cabins in the woods to building the means to develop technologies that might somehow avert the apocalypse. The trouble is, pioneering said apocalypse-averting technologies might itself bring about disaster in a gameworld that simulates things like habitat death, species extinction, air pollution and catastrophic flooding. 


Players must thus walk a careful line between resource exploitation and self-inflicted calamity by monitoring their impact on the overall simulation, founding the right kind of government, and passing laws or devising economies (including player-created currencies) that don't flip the ecosystem upside down. The Steam reviews teem with anecdotes about people waking up to find their oil wells underwater, and it sounds like things will only get knottier when Eco releases out of early access around the end of this year.

When it came to exploring The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom's massive Hyrule, Ultrahand felt like a gift from Hylia herself. Why would you walk anywhere when you could build a hoverbike in seconds? A part of us wished that such a feature had always been around to help us traverse Link's previous trials. If only there was a mod where we could see how ridiculous that would look in, say, Ocarina of Time, eh?
Surprise! There is one! Modder notCHase has managed to recreate the handy building feature in the PC port of Ocarina of Time and the results are... kind of hilarious, if we're honest (thanks, Gaming Reinvented). Yes, the functions are a tad more basic than that which we find in TOTK (don't be expecting to see any Mechs), but, hey, it works.

A better deal than the RTX 4080 for that resolution, in any case.
Now, though, we can all agree: nobody should buy an RTX 4070 Ti. Not when the RTX 4070 Ti Super is here, doing a better, hopefully less contentious job of smooth 4K without demanding RTX 4080 (or, indeed, RTX 4080 Super) levels of investment.

The group have not, it now seems, stolen a bunch of login data, WIP software and payment information from the creators of Fortnite; they were only pretending to have done so with a view to duping other hackers into buying their tools. 


Or at least, that's what they're said to be saying now. I haven't tracked down the original source for Mogilevich's latest statement, and in any case, anything you read from a self-described "professional fraudster" should probably be treated with caution. Still, it lines up with Epic's own comments last week that there was no real sign that a hack had taken place.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Three people arrested in China last year for operating major piracy site B9Good have been sentenced by a local court. Foreign companies face significant obstacles when attempting to enforce their rights in China but here, anti-piracy group CODA, acting for major Japanese anime rightsholders, came up with a novel strategy. The convictions of a pirate site operator and two uploaders are the first ever obtained by foreign rightsholders inside China.

Believe it or not, TRIANGLE STRATEGY is now two years old. Yep, Square Enix's brilliant HD-2D RPG was released two years ago today (4th March) and producer Yasuaki Arai has taken to the game's official Twitter account to celebrate the anniversary.
In a message thanking the fans for their continued support, Arai shared a new piece of artwork by game artist Rina Yoshiura, showing a selection of the war council gang sitting down for a slap-up meal.

Updated with the excellent Balatro and Pocket Card Jockey. Enjoy!

You'd be forgiven for thinking that physical tabletop gaming might have trouble surviving in this digital and ever-mobile age, but collectible card games and traditional board games are arguably more popular than ever. Excellent digital versions of household staples sit alongside entirely original offerings that serve up the full tabletop experience with added digital convenience. Online play can be a real lifesaver if you're stuck indoors and can't get to a friend's house, and not needing to lug a weighty card collection around will do wonders for your posture, too.

Metal Gear Solid 3 Snake Eater is, in my opinion, the greatest game in the Metal Gear Solid franchise. It added a manual camouflage system and on the fly medical treatments consisting of bugs, twigs, and whatever else is lying around in the jungle. Its plot perfectly sets up every other game in the series, and its gameplay manages to pull back the futuristic stealth tactics to a more grounded level that makes them feel incredibly tangible.

All Helldivers 2 players understand the pain of collecting Samples.

For the most part, everyone is keen to jump on the "god, the Switch is sooo old" bandwagon. The thing is, they are right and boy are we reminded of that today.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Moon Studios, creators of the impeccable Ori and the Blind Forest, has finally held a showcase for its next game, No Rest for the Wicked. It details the world, combat, and what already feels like a gripping story drenched in darkness and brimming with depth. 


Until yesterday all we had to go on for Moon Studios' next title was a short trailer that made it look more like a pirate title than anything else. The Wicked Inside: Showcase, a video packed with 25 minutes of gameplay and discussion on No Rest for the Wicked, has now properly revealed this game to the world, and I'm hooked. 


No Rest for the Wicked Hits Early Access Next Month With a Unique Blend of RPG Gameplay




No Rest for the Wicked is the polar opposite of Ori and the Blind Forest, but that's because Moon Studios' staff ha…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It was recently revealed that Return to Silent Hill - a new movie based on Silent Hill 2 - has finished filming. Yeah, even though it has flown a bit under the radar, a new Silent Hill movie based on the events of Silent Hill 2 has been in the works for a while, and I'm cautiously optimistic about it.


I know that getting two re-tellings of Silent Hill 2 in such a short timespan will probably strike many as weird, but the good news here is that they've brought back Christophe Gans, the French director responsible for the original Silent Hill film — the one that kinda owns, not the awful 3D one.




On top of my belief that Gans is a talented director with a strong artistic vision, I also trust him to helm the project because, well, he's had a good influence on gaming even without knowing …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you ask people, “What’s your go-to nuclear post-apocalyptic story?” Most will probably say Fallout; the action role-playing franchise that has been around for more than two decades and is now considered one of the most influential game series of all time.


Fallout is one of those massively successful and recognizable names that had very humble beginnings. It may not be as dramatic a tale as two broke programmers grinding in sweat and tears, day and night, to come up with an era-defining masterpiece, but that first game in 1997 is very different from the Bethesda shooter you know and adore today.


In many ways, Fallout was the brainchild of Tim Cain (Pillars of Eternity, The Outer Worlds) who worked on the initial concept for six months before getting the go-ahead from Interplay. By th…]]></summary>

Apparently, the UK rating board PEGI changed the rating from 3+ to 18+ overnight due to "prominent gambling imagery" which prompted the sudden delistings. The problem here is that there is literally no gambling in Balatro.




According to Playstack, they specifically addressed this topic with PEGI back in October after it was originally rated 18+. And, after some communication, PEGI changed the rating to 3+. PEGI even went as far as to assure Playstack that "we have reviewed your product and determined that the disclosure of gambling themes was unwarranted."

In a town hall with staff earlier this week, CEO and co-founder Randy Pitchford reportedly told staff that a decision had been made regarding the studio's future, with more details to be shared in March.

Embracer bought Gearbox for $1.3 billion (around £1.02 billion) in 2021, but it was reported that they were looking to sell last year as part of ongoing layoffs, closures and divestments.

Now, after more than two months of radio silence, Avatar's got a new update that includes some surprising improvements. Some aren't anything to write home about, but other bits from the latest patch notes are worth your attention. 


Title Update 3 goes live with bug fixes galore


The new Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora Title Update 3 patch notes highlight many quest-related bugs, from minor annoyances to soft locks, have been addressed. Teleporting away after a death in certain situations no longer prevents you from completing a quest, and NPCs no longer stand on furniture at certain points during the story.

Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days. Majora's Mask's unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.
Join Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard today and each Friday on Twitch at 2 p.m. CT as they gradually work their way through the entire game until Termina is saved.

LocalThunk's excellent roguelike deckbuilder Balatro has been removed from various Switch eShops "without any advance warning" following an apparent age rating change from 3+ to 18+ by European ratings board PEGI.
Publisher Playstack issued a statement via Twitter saying the publisher is "especially disappointed in the actions of the ratings board" following post-appeal assurances in October 2023 that the game did not contain gambling themes after they had presumably been flagged in the certification process.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Moon Studios, makers of the acclaimed Ori and the Blind Forest/Will of the Wisps, is tackling a dramatically different project in its first action RPG, No Rest for the Wicked. First revealed during last year’s Game Awards, the studio held a special livestream presentation where it revealed the game’s early access release date: April 18.
No Rest for the Wicked takes place in a dark medieval fantasy world where a deadly plague has befallen an island community, transforming citizens into monsters. You play a chosen warrior to fight against this blight. Combing elements of Diablo, Dark Souls, and even Animal Crossing, you’ll fight for survival while restoring the town of Sacrament. No Rest for the Wicked also happens to be Game Informer’s latest cover story.
Although No Rest for the Wicked will be on Steam via Early Access for the foreseeable future, the game will come to consoles when it eventually launches into 1.0. Our digital cover story launches on March 5, and you can keep an eye out for exclusive features and videos in our cover story hub.]]></summary>

In it, Wesley explores a medieval coast, gets slaughtered a few times by some tough opponents, saves a blacksmith in trouble, and takes on the game's first boss, all while the two discuss their overall thoughts on Moon's pivot to this new genre.

Last month, I traveled to Vienna, Austria, with Game Informer editor Marcus Stewart to visit Ori series developer Moon Studios. It was here that Marcus spoke to Mahler and his fellow Moon co-founder and technical director Gennadiy Korol about No Rest For The Wicked, the action RPG adorning Issue 365 of Game Informer magazine, as you might have just learned if you watched Wicked Inside today. 
I watched Marcus play the game for a couple of hours, and while I was there to film for cover story purposes, I'd be lying if I said I didn’t watch with…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Moon Studios cemented itself as a premier upstart studio thanks to its stellar work on Ori and the Blind Forest and Ori and the Will of the Wisps. The team is parlaying that success and experience to craft a dramatically different project it's been dreaming about for years: No Rest for the Wicked. This dark fantasy action RPG combines influences from a variety of genres, from ARPGs like Diablo to the difficulty and thoughtful combat of Dark Souls, to the town-building of Animal Crossing, and more.
We traveled to Vienna, Austria, to visit the home (and Moon's de facto headquarters) of co-founder Thomas Mahler. Joined by Moon's other co-founder and CEO, Gennadiy Korol, we went hands-on with No Rest for the Wicked and filled 12 pages with our impressions and exclusive details about the game's…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Ori And The Blind Forest developers Moon Studios announced that their next game would be a top-down, online action RPG, my initial reaction was, 'Heck yes, sign me the hell up for this Souls-y, Diablo-y hack and slash.' Having now played the opening 90 minutes of the game ahead of tonight's Wicked Inside showcase, that initial excitement has settled into more of a 'Hoo boy, this thing is hard as nails. Folks who like Elden Ring and Dark Souls are going to go absolutely bananas for it.' It's definitely verging on the edge of being just a teensy bit too punishing for my personal taste, but even though my arse got thoroughly whomped time and time again during this initial prologue section, there's still something about No Rest For The Wicked that's left me quietly captivated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Crash Team Rumble, the 4v4 competitive multiplayer game, is getting its final content update next week, less than a year after its launch. However, the game will still be available to play. 
Players who boot up the game have been greeted with a message, posted below, announcing that on March 4, Crash Team Rumble will get its last content drop. The game is not shutting down, though. The base experience will remain live and players will have access to a free 500-tier battle pass. This includes 104 new items from all content across Seasons 1 through 3 and all available event rewards. Developer Toys for Bob has also disabled Crash Coin purchases, and players can use any remaining coins to buy battle pass tier skips.
Crash Team Rumble launched last year on June 20, meaning the game's support only lasted for roughly seven months. While it's nice that the game won't be disappearing for the time being (especially since it's quite fun), it's a bummer to see its support dry up so quickly. 
We quite enjoyed Crash Team Rumble, scoring it an 8 out of 10 in our review. Writer Aron Garst writes, "Crash Team Rumble's take on multiplayer platforming madness is unique, with enough depth to keep you on your toes after hours of gameplay. Those searching for a fresh take on the long-running series should give it a try." 


In related news, Toys for Bob announced that it's splitting from Activision Blizzard to go independent and potentially partner with Microsoft. You can read more about the studio's plans here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ahhhh love is in the air. Or maybe it's the Mako...regardless, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is finally out on PlayStation 5 and that's something we can all celebrate. We had a great time with it – read Game Informer's Final Fantasy VII Rebirth review here – and one of the many reasons we enjoyed our 80-plus hours playing is because of the various relationships within the game and Cloud's party. Whether you're Team Clerith or Team Clifa, or maybe Team Cloud XIII (is that a thing?), there's plenty that will leave you satisfied. 
Chief among those things is the special date night that happens within the Gold Saucer. We won't spoil when it happens in the game, and we won't discuss it in detail here, but we do want to let you know that we spent dozens of hours maxing out our relationships with each party member. That means we were able to take part in all possible dates at the Gold Saucer, and we captured each for you to watch below. 
Here's Every Gold Saucer Date In Final Fantasy VII Rebirth


For more about the game, read Game Informer's Final Fantasy VII Rebirth review, and then check out our guide of the best side quests in the game. After that, check out our Queen's Blood tips and tricks (and our best deck build), and then read about how New Game Plus works in Final Fantasy VII Rebirth. That's not all, though – we also have a ranking of every minigame and a segway showdown between Final Fantasy VII Rebirth and Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth.

The Guardian Games is a yearly event in Destiny 2 framed as a friendly competition between the three playable classes. It's the one time of year when players are encouraged to compete against each other to help their favored class reign supreme.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new Terminator game has been in development for some time, and you'll be able to play it later this year. Well, in Early Access at least, as Terminator: Survivor will be hitting Steam on October 24. Check out the "Aftermath" trailer below.


If you haven't heard of this – and I must admit I was a bit ignorant of it – Survivors is an open-world game that's set after Judgment Day in James Cameron's sci-fi universe. 




The above trailer doesn't give a huge amount away. We see two scavengers, nervously seeking out supplies. With the world in such turmoil, the threat of a Terminator is ever-present. We then get to see the reflection of one of the skeletal robots as it scans the two fuel-seeking humans.


100% rustproof


Terminator: Survivors is being developed by Nacon, and is pretty hot off the heels of the publisher's previous game based on a popular sci-fi franchise: RoboCop: Rogue City. Much like the latter, Rogue City offers a new lease on life for the iconic film series.


Whether Survivors will be as well received remains to be seen at this stage. An open-world game where you're fighting and surviving against killer robots? Sign me the heck up.


Nacon describes the upcoming game – which is also getting a release on Xbox Series X|S and PS5 – thus:



It’s been four years since the day humanity nearly perished. The truth of the event is still muddied in half-truths as you emerge from a shelter to attempt [to] reestablish some semblance of society in a world that seems hell-bent on eliminating you and the last vestiges of mankind. You are tasked with scouring the surrounding land for materials, information, other survivors and key resources in order to establish a base of operations for your fledgling group.




Fun!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The remaster of the original three Tomb Raider games was released not that long ago. For PC users, there was a choice between purchasing it on Steam or Epic Games Store. However, there seemed to be some notable differences between the two versions, which the developer has now acknowledged.


According to a post from The Gamer a couple of days ago, fans began to notice that Tomb Raider I-III Remastered was different on EGS than on Steam. For starters, the Epic Games version had different skyboxes in places like the Colosseum, and the Greece levels had "new light holes."




Since then, a post on the Steam page has noted that EGS had a build of the remaster that had "incomplete assets," and the download contained "some work-in-progress materials" that weren't meant for public consumption.


Update also imminent


Aspyr has now fixed the problem, uploading the correct version to Epic. However, some – such as a reporter from Eurogamer and the aforementioned The Gamer article – have noted this incomplete build had better-looking assets than the Steam version. This could suggest that the two downloads are not evenly matched, for whatever reason.


That aside, Tomb Raider I-III Remastered is also getting its first update soon. In the same Steam post, the developer thanked fans for their "continued support, shares, and feedback" on the games, with an update said to be in the works.


We don't exactly know what's coming, but the studio says it anticipates sending this update out "in the next few weeks."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are moments where Sons Of The Forest matches the sublime paranoia of Subnautica. There’s that same lurching, exquisite tension as you delve deeper and deeper into darkness where you are not welcome, supplies dwindling, footfall echoing, monstrosities skittering about in the black. On my most intense plunge into one cave, I groaned aloud as the path I was praying must be the exit twisted back on itself, sending me first down a rope, and then into a long slide down, down into the earth, back into the spindly clutches of pale, bifurcated mutants. When I finally saw the sun again, I could have cried.
It’s still a bit wonky, but the full 1.0 release makes the Forest a fuller, livelier and more inviting (or else alluringly off-putting) prospect for a wander - even, as in my case, a wholly solo one. Consider this your cue to peel open some skin pouches.

The Simpsons is, somehow, still a thing in 2024. Regardless of what we might think of its overall quality, however, there's no denying that the cartoon is able to pull off some truly weird and wacky crossovers.
While presumably not an official crossover by any means, the show has recently strayed into the realm of Mario Kart with a bizarre dream sequence in which Lisa, Homer, Milhouse, and more partake in a race on what appears to be a take on the racing franchise's Rainbow Road (thanks, Eurogamer).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As the video games industry violently contracts to ensure shareholder satisfaction at the cost of making thousands upon thousands of people unemployed, Skylanders studio Toys For Bob have announced they're splitting from Activision Blizzard and Microsoft to go independent. Good for them, but maybe too late for some. Earlier this month, the San Francisco Chronicle reported that it seemed Activision Blizzard were closing Toys For Bob's California headquarters and laying off 86 people. Still, the new independent Toys For Bob say they're working on something new and "exploring a possible partnership" with Microsoft.

Contrary to some reports, today's changes don't amount to a total ban on VPNs. Use of state approved VPNs, which do everything except the useful stuff, remain legal. The new law criminalizes the promotion of VPNs for site-blocking circumvention. But Russia also wants citizen's to stay safe, warning that VPNs in the U.S. are prone to government spying.

Hopefully the Gauntlet provides new end-game goals


Diablo 4 has a pretty big end-game content problem right now. There's not really much to do and hardly a reason to level all the way up to 100 other than just to say you did the grind. However, that might change with the introduction of the Gauntlet.


Accessible for both Normal and Hardcore characters, the Gauntlet unlocks for players on the Seasonal Realm once they've gained access to World Tier IV. However, the monsters in the Gauntlet are over Level 1…]]></summary>

However, thanks to the recent implementation of patch 0.1.5.1, this ability has been removed, and players are feeling mixed emotions about it. On one hand, the community is upset that they can no longer capture Lily or Victor, but there’s widespread amusement due to Pocketpair’s public apology on the matter.




It’s not very often that a development team apologises for doing what they do - namely fixing bugs - in such a public manner. Commenters on the post are in agreement on one thing, though: The Pocketpair team is damned if they do and …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Embracer Group, the company behind the closure of Saints Row studio Volition Games and layoffs at companies like Eidos-Montréal and Black Forest Games, is set to sell Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic remake developer Saber Interactive, according to a new Bloomberg report. Embracer is selling the developer to a group of private investors in a deal worth $500 million, a source told the publication. 
Once the deal goes through, Saber Interactive will be a privately owned company and free from Embracer, which is behind layoffs spread throughout the past couple of years. Following the transaction, the studio will continue work on its Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic remake, which it took over as the developer after Aspyr Media was removed from it in 2022. 


Bloomberg reports this sale is another effort of Embracer to cut costs alongside studio closures and layoffs after a planned $2 billion deal with Saudi Arabia-backed Savvy Games Group fell through in 2023. The publication writes one of its sources says the $500 million deal comes with the option for Saber Interactive to bring with it multiple Embracer subsidiaries as well. 
Saber Interactive is also working on the recently announced first-person Jurassic Park: Survival.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Google has a long history of easter eggs, from HTML trickery to paying homage to Bletchley Park with a very apt decoding animation. I can say with certainty that I wasn’t expecting to see a stampede of Chocobos on my screen today, though.


But that’s what happens if you do a search for “Chocobo” or “Final Fantasy”, in celebration of the release of Final Fantasy VII Rebirth. Along with the adorable retro Chocobos, you’ll also see a few Cloud Strifes, complete with Buster Sword aplenty and some (slightly disorienting) shaking visuals for the links underneath.


With the excitement surrounding the long awaited release of Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, it makes sense that Google would add this feature as they’ve done for popular titles in the past, such as the Last of Us mushroom easter egg.


How to get a Chocobo stampede on Google


Screenshot by Destructoid


It’s super simple to see this easter egg for yourself. All you need to do is head to Google and search “Chocobo” or “Final Fantasy”. All of the usual results will appear, but there will be a small yellow button in the middle of your browser window, toward the bottom, complete with a Chocobo silhouette. 


Clicking on this button once will result in one or two Chocobos and the accompanying shakes of the search results beneath, but the fun really starts when you repeatedly spam click. Doing so will result in a stampede of multicolored Chocobos, as well as Cloud making an appearance. 


Be careful though, maybe it’s just me being a little too over eager, but pressing the button too much may result in slowing your browser down to a standstill, at least for a little while. 


Still, it’s fun. Give it a try!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Sand Sailor Studio and publisher Thunderful Games revealed today that the upcoming Viking sandbox survival builder ASKA will be getting a Closed Beta test in April. The Closed Beta will run from April 15 through April 21, with sign-ups open now through April 5.




Players can embark on a Viking expedition solo or with up to three friends as they work together to build a Viking empire. Collecting resources, building a thriving settlement, and summoning intelligent NPC villages are some of the tasks required to do so. Players will also need to automate, manage, and defend their tribe especially to survive the bitter cold winter.



"ASKA stands as a testament to what a dream-team of just 10 people can achieve over the course of 4 years: an ambitious co-op survival tribe builder where you're never alone, where you work alongside lively AI villagers that are almost indistinguishable from players, all woven into a deep city builder-like economy system. We’re entering the final phase of our beta testing period and we can't wait to give players the power to build their very own truly functional Viking village, who knows what they'll build."
- Cristian Diaconescu, Creative Director at Sand Sailor Studio



We've seen quite a few survival builders released recently. But honestly, all you had to say was Viking and I'm in. Based on the trailer it looks like you can get pretty creative with actually building out your settlement. And hopefully, they mean it when they say intelligent NPC villagers. I've seen several games in the genre recently add NPCs to help players with tasks like gathering, building, and even fighting. But none of them have quite gotten it right.


Those interested in participating in the Closed Beta that runs from April 15 through April 21 can ASKA Discord server before April 5.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You may have noticed that SSDs got extremely cheap towards the end of 2023, and then they rebounded somewhat in 2024. We normally expect better deals at Black Friday than during the rest of the year, but this is something a bit different, with oversupply in 2023 leading to significant reductions that aren't likely to be repeated in 2024. However, there are still some better deals than others, and unless you can hop in a time machine they're still well worth covering. 
The subject of today's deals post is the Kingston KC3000, an SSD that I use in my own testing PC thanks to its high capacity, impressive PCIe 4.0 speeds and generally aggressive pricing. Today you can pick up the 2TB KC3000 for £123, a fair price for a drive that cost more than £150 at the start of 2024.

The game begins with you inheriting a small newspaper business from your uncle. The paper publishes each Sunday, so you need to start sending out your small team of reporters to find stories immediately. Every story is marked by tags – like crime, politics, or sports – that correspond to the interests of various readers. The tags you choose to print each week, particularly the ones that make it to your front page, affect how much money you earn.

With a concurrent player cap of 700,000 players, Helldivers 2 has now revealed that it's got a veritable "Game Master" coordinating its war efforts.


Notably, it's plain as day that Helldivers 2's galactic war efforts are not just a randomized series of combat scenarios thrown together by an algorithm. A prime example of this being the case was the rapid onslaught of Automaton forces after Super Earth won its first clash against the Terminid. Not only can Arrowhead Studios thus create a custom "campaign" for the entire community to participate in, though, but there's a developer whose job is specifically to spice things up in the live game.

As you navigate a reality-bending doomsday loop, your vehicle is the only thing keeping you from impending death – if you're good enough at driving it. I've had fun in this world speeding through the forest and grabbing glowing yellow orbs, but the car is one of the most interesting parts to me for one reason: I don't have a driver's license yet.
After years of procrastination and two expired temporary permits, I've finally started learning to drive in earnest. I spent years of adulthood in the dark, and it's been fascinating to open my eyes to something that is an everyday experience for millions of people.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Toys for Bob, the studio behind games like Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy, Spyro Reignited Trilogy, and Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time, has announced it is splitting from its owner Activision Blizzard to go independent. It is also exploring a partnership with Microsoft. 
Toys for Bob announced this in a statement released today, which explains why now is "the time to take the studio and our future games to the next level." 


Here's Toys for Bob's statement, in full: 
Toys for Bob did not disclose a price (if there is one) associated with its split from Activision Blizzard, which arrives just a few months after Microsoft purchased the company for a colossal $69 billion.
Toys for Bob joins another studio leaving the hands of its owner today: With a $500 million deal, Embracer Group has sold Saber Interactive to a group of private investors, as reported by Bloomberg. Kotaku is also reporting today that Gearbox, the makers of the Borderlands series, is looking to break away from Embracer Group as well.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Final Fantasy VII has always been an extremely weird game, from the impromptu snowboarding excursion to fighting a Triceratops fused with a truck. That sense of weirdness seeps into every aspect of the game and often rears its head as a strange—and, more often than not, janky—minigame. The 1997 game takes a “throw…

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rocket Rat Games co-founder John Guerra remembers the exact day he started working on Cobalt Core's first prototype. He and his fellow co-founder Ben Driscoll had just spent a week playing Daniel Mullins' mysterious roguelike deckbuilder Inscryption at the end of October 2021, but the combination of a bad storm and a power outage ended up forcing Guerra to decamp from his home in Massachusetts and stay with some family until it all blew over. "I got back late on Halloween, just in time to put out a bowl of candy for some kids, and then the next morning we started Cobalt Core," he tells me.
The pair had been working on a range of different prototypes in the months leading up to this lightbulb moment. As development on their debut game, the spaceship building puzzler Sunshine Heavy Industries, began winding down, "we were throwing all kinds of stuff at the wall," he says, including games in 3D, a platformer, with Driscoll revealing they even had "a Terraria-like one for a couple of weeks" with a grid-based world that characters bounced around in. But it was playing Inscryption that brought everything to a head. Both had spent hundreds of hours with Slay The Spire, but "Inscryption proved to us that there was still a lot of space to explore in the genre," says Guerra. And with increasing calls from Sunshine Heavy Industries players begging them to let them fly the ships they were creating in its shipyard sandbox, "you can kind of see how that went from A to B".

I.e., when you have good news you can go round the houses, but if you have bad news - like sending an all-hands email to the staff at EA to let them know that, less than a year after the last round of layoffs, a further 5% of them are getting booted - then you should just come out and say it as quickly and simply as possible.
This is, apparently, not a sentiment ever internalised by Andrew Wilson, EA's CEO. Yesterday, when he announced to everyone at EA that a bunch of them were losing their jobs (again), he first spent three paragraphs talking about how EA is doing great, leading the industry, getting increasing engagement from fans, optimising their global footprint and sunsetting games oh yep, there it is, that's the "you're about to be unemployed" language right there. The company is moving away from "the development of future licensed IP" and toward "our owned IP, sports, and massive online communities". Therefore: 670 ish devs (by Eurogamer's count) must go.

Taking place over multiple continents on the Planet (or Gaia as it was retroacively called) with various party members, a bunch of open-world areas, and lots of side activities and minigames to partake in, you're going to be playing this game for at least 50 to 60 hours before you roll credits (I reached the ending at 80 hours). 
When you've seen the story through, you might not be ready to hang up the ole' Buster Sword. Fortunately, Rebirth has New Game Plus. Well, kinda – it's complicated.

However, regardless of whether you're a long-time fan or not, one thing new to everyone playing Rebirth is Queen's Blood. 
Introduced early in Rebirth, Queen's Blood is an in-universe card game that seemingly everyone around Gaia's various continents plays, from Junon to Nibelheim and elsewhere. And after spending dozens of hours playing it, I can understand why - it rules. It's easily my favorite game-within-a-game ever, and one I hope spins out into its own thing in some form, be it a digital card game, a physical one, or something else.

It's safe to say completing everything Rebirth offers will take 100 or more hours, and that's before you add in dozens of minigames to the game's slew of offerings.

I’m not a poker player. I’ve never learned the game, and my limited knowledge of it largely stems from pop culture osmosis, such as James Bond films and referential quips from X-Men’s Gambit. I couldn’t tell you what makes a Royal Flush, but I know it’s good to have it. Despite its premise and appearance, Balatro technically isn’t poker. It is, however, the first title to make me understand and enjoy the core premise of the card game. It also happens to be one of the most engrossing games of the year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Could there be a more than universally relatable quote shared by indie developers than: "We really just wanted to make a small game"? Of course, there's little to complain about when games like Cuphead or Owlboy finally see the light of the day, demonstrating what wonders growing ambition can often bring.
Having said that, I’m not entirely surprised that Vladimir Semenets, the lead game designer of Militsioner, sits in front of me on Zoom and tells me how they initially envisioned a six-month project, "something very fast". Yet, here we are, three years and more than a dozen developer vlogs since TallBoys' surreal runaway sim first captured everyone's attention (including one state-owned Russian news channel). If not for its Kafkaesque premise, which pits players against a ten-story tall looming policeman in a quest to escape a small town, then definitely because of the game’s ambitious voice recognition feature that promised real-time conversation instead of pre-written dialogue.

There might be fun in some of its slower moments, but some of the generally positive, "It's actually quite a good game!" takes that I've seen honestly baffle me. The game is a series of long, annoying journeys, during which the most fun I had was turning my head to watch Catfish on my other monitor. MTV's show about people getting duped online was the perfect sailing companion, and perhaps, one of the only reasons I survived my brush with the live service seas.

To make that perhaps a little less daunting, Paradox have launched an optional monthly subscription service that gives you access to all the expansions. They've done this for several of their other grand strategy games before. It starts at £8.50 for one month then offers discounts for longer terms. While I can see niche uses for the option, I certainly wouldn't want to pay for this regularly. Would you?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Life is Strange: True Colors developer Deck Nine has announced it is laying off 20 percent of its staff. In the statement announcing this news, Deck Nine didn't name a specific reason for the layoffs, instead stating the studio has been affected by the industry's worsening conditions. Twenty percent of Deck Nine's staff is equal to roughly 30 employees, according to a report from Eurogamer. 
Here's Deck Nine's statement, in full: 


Deck Nine game director Stephan Frost said on X (formerly Twitter) that leadership within the studio took pay cuts to keep the number of layoffs down as much as possible. "This is the strongest team [Deck Nine] has ever been and it absolutely sucks that the industry is in the state that it is presently," Frost adds.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A long time ago on a desktop far, far away, my family once owned a demo disc for the original Star Wars: Dark Forces. I cannot remember for the life of me which level(s) it contained. My only surviving memory of it is having quite a good time blasting Stormtroopers and the chaps in black with the swoopy, knock-off Vader helmets, but also getting terribly lost and not really knowing what the heck I was meant to be doing. Now, playing Nightdive Studio's Star Wars: Dark Forces Remaster as an adult probably close to three decades later, both these feelings have come roaring back, as this is very much a Star Wars FPS in the vein of Doom and other early 90s shooters (thumbs up). But it's one that leans so hard into its maze-like level design that it can regularly feel like a little bit of a tough hang in the cold hard light of 2024 (thumbs down).
Crucially, though, not to the point where it's best left consigned to the history books. This is still an enjoyable and worthwhile artefact in Star Wars' PC gaming history, and if your eyes (and general patience levels) can't quite stomach the 'Classic' and still available 1995 original, then this remaster is a pin-sharp glow-up for modern hardware.

        <updated>2024-02-28T13:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[NetEase Games has pulled back the curtains on its newest studio, BulletFarm. Led by David Vonderhaar, whose experience includes leading the teams behind the Call of Duty: Black Ops series, BulletFarm aims to develop a new triple-A game that utilizes first-person gameplay with an emphasis on co-op in Unreal Engine 5. It will be set in an original universe. 
This unannounced and untitled game will "craft a more intimate and relatable experience while offering a fresh take on first-person gameplay," according to a press release. 
BulletFarm is taking a remote-first approach to game development but considers itself a triple-A studio headquartered in Los Angeles, California. Joining Vonderhaar is the studio's creative director Chris Cowell. The studio is currently looking to hire in various roles to fill out the founding team. 

"Starting this new studio has given me a chance to step out of my comfort zone and try my hand at making something entirely new and different," Vonderhaar writes in a press release. "This is a departure from the games I've worked on, but one that showcases my passion for rich characters, precise mechanics, more intimate storytelling, and plenty of action. NetEase has provided us an incredible support structure to explore these new avenues and allow true freedom to begin building the concept and ideas for our game." 
NetEase president of global investments and partnerships Simon Zhu says the company is fully dedicated to giving BulletFarm the resources and support it requires to build its new first-person experience. "David's leadership and the early collection of game development talent assembled at the studio is set to offer something truly unique for his existing fans along with a new audience." 
BulletFarm is currently developing its first title, but there's no word on when to expect to see it. 
What kind of game do you hope BulletFarm makes? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

Titled Paranormal Activity: Found Footage, it's being published by DreadXP and features some kind of reactive haunt system, with scares dialling up and down based on your actions. DreadXP have shared a teaser consisting of some crackly logos against a backdrop of radio chatter. Given that this is a Paranormal Activity adaptation, it's possible the trailer harbours spooky secrets. You may wish to experiment with turning the brightness up and down, playing the video backwards, or watching it again at the next full moon, perhaps while standing in a cemetery loudly declaring that ghosts aren't real.

        <updated>2024-02-27T19:30:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A massive sweep of layoffs has rocked various Sony first-party studios today, including Naughty Dog, Guerilla Games, and Insomniac. Another victim is Firesprite Games, the UK studio behind The Playroom games and The Persistence, and an additional casualty from that studio is reportedly a new Twisted Metal title.
According to Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier, Firesprite had a Twisted Metal game in the works that has now been canceled. He reports that the game was a live-service title and very early in development, so it was not yet officially greenlit. You can read his full report here. 
NEW: As part of today's mass layoff, Sony has canceled a Twisted Metal live-service game that was in development at UK-based studio Firesprite, Bloomberg has learned.
https://t.co/pvCDsS7yxe
February 27, 2024
Twisted Metal was PlayStation’s original flagship series, launching a couple of months after the PS1 was released in North America in the fall of 1995. The series includes eight sequels/spin-offs, the last of which remains the 2012 reboot for PS3. Peacock’s well-received live-action series has at least kept the series alive and is getting a second season. 
The number of layoffs to hit Firespirte is currently unknown. Sony acquired Firesprite in 2021, where it helped co-develop Horizon Call of the Mountain with Guerrilla Games. 900 employees have been laid off across several Sony 1st-party studios in various department. Blood & Truth creators London Studio has been shut down entirely. PlayStation Studios Hermen Hulst has cited overgrowth as the reason for the layoffs, and that the publisher has examined its portfolio of upcoming projects to determine which ones will cease production. It would appear that whatever this Twisted Metal project would have been, it's among several titles getting the axe.

        <updated>2024-02-27T18:29:09.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A video game based on the Paranormal Activity film franchise has been announced. Developed by Darkstone Digital, makers of the 2022 horror game The Mortuary Assistant, along with publisher DreadXP and Paramount Pictures, the upcoming game is slated to release in 2026. 
Like the films, Paranormal Activity will feature found-footage-style gameplay as well as a “Haunt System,” which dynamically changes the types of scares that unfold based on players’ actions. Unfortunately, a brief teaser trailer doesn’t do much but show some logos, so we may be waiting a while to see the game in action. 


“We are thrilled to work with Paramount Game Studios and to have the opportunity to bring the world of Paranormal Activity to gamers everywhere,” said Epic Pictures CEO and DreadXP producer Patrick Ewald in a press release. “The films are steeped in rich lore and creative scares, and under the stewardship of creative director Brian Clarke, DreadXP’s Paranormal Activity video game will honor those core tenets and offer horror fans one of our most terrifying games yet.”
Paranormal Activity has no announced platforms. It’s not the franchise’s first foray into video games. A 2017 game called Paranormal Activity: The Lost Soul was released for PS4 and PC and was playable in VR.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After recently revealing the full launch roster for WWE 2K24, we now know the superstars arriving post-launch. 2K has revealed the five DLC packs rolling out throughout the year, and they include the Best in the World, one of the biggest female superstar signings in recent memory, and even a Grammy-nominated recording artist. 
CM Punk headlines this DLC roster, marking his first appearance in a WWE game since WWE 2K15 in 2014 (the year he walked out of the company). It would appear the Voice of the Voiceless’ recent social media campaign to be included in the 2K24’s DLC plans paid off faster than expected, and he’s part of the first pack, no less. I smell a work, but it’s good to have him back in an official in-game capacity, regardless.
Other big highlights include Jade Cargill, Pat McAfee, and 2K24 soundtrack curator and award-winning music artist Post Malone. Check out the full list of superstars in each pack below.

Such a weak title deserves a much worse game, but this captures the feeling of its late 90s FPS influences as they actually were, and ends up just familiar enough to work, and just original enough to refresh the formula. At times, it's a little too accurate, but even with its annoyances dialled up by the pressure of playing it too hard for the sake of review, I'm impressed with the balancing act it's struck.

Then it was "I refuse to play Helldivers 2 as a co-op shooter", which again, is a stance I am sticking with, even as I am overrun and sat on by Terminid Chargers. And now it's "I refuse to play Cobalt Core as a roguelike deck-builder, because it secretly isn't one". Come now, squint at the header image so that the text and numbers fade away, and all you can see are coloured shapes. Pay attention to certain underlying rhythms while playing.

Several well-known PlayStation studios are affected, including The Last Of Us developer Naughty Dog, Ratchet & Clank developer Insomniac Games, Horizon developer Guerilla Games and PlayStation VR specialists Firesprite. It's also proposed that PlayStation close Sony London in their entirety, though the exact scale of the reductions remains to be seen.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While the main headline event from today's Pokémon Presents showcase was the announcement of Pokémon Legends: Z-A, it wasn't the only new game that got announced. It shares that status with Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket, a new mobile game that allows players to collect, trade, and battle with the franchise's signature trading cards.
Check out the reveal trailer below:


While there are several features available in the game, Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket seems to focus the most on the collection aspect, which is fitting given the renaissance of physical card games in recent years. While no details on microtransactions are given, the end of the trailer notes that players will get two free packs a day – implying that more than that might come at a cost.
You'll also be able to trade cards with other players and battle them online as well. The trailer also shows off immersive cards, which seem to feature a 3D cinematic inside the cards.
The app is being developed by DeNA (best known for their work on Pokémon Masters) and is due out sometime later this year. For more Pokémon cards, check out our Trading Card hub, which features some of our favorite pulls from the game's big releases.]]></summary>

It is also closing London Studio, the team behind PlayStation VR's Blood & Truth and VR Worlds. In a statement released by head of PlayStation Studios Hermen Hulst, he seems to cite overgrowth as the reason for the layoffs. 
PlayStation's Technology, Creative, and Support teams are also affected by these layoffs, according to Hulst. He writes, "These are in addition to some smaller reductions in other teams across PlayStation Studios." These layoffs will result in an 8 percent reduction of staff, or around 900 people losing their jobs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During today's Pokémon Presents stream celebrating Pokémon Day, we got our first look at the next major title coming to the Nintendo Switch. Called Pokémon Legends: Z-A, the teaser suggests the game will be set in Lumiose City, a Paris-inspired area first seen in Pokémon X and Y. It's not just a long-awaited follow up to Pokémon Legends: Arceus – it's an overdue return to the world of Pokémon X and Y.
Check out some images from the trailer below:

The teaser, which does not contain any actual gameplay footage, shows a Pikachu hopping around a city made of glowing blue lines. While it's not immediately clear that the city is Lumiose, eagle-eyed fans will notice many familiar friends from that generation of games, including Pyroar, Flabébé, Klefki, and Hawlucha. These images are juxtaposed with architectural sketches and the words "urban redevelopment plan." This would suggest that Pokémon Legends Z might take place during the construction of Lumiose City, putting it in line with the historical setting we experienced with Pokémon Legends: Arceus.
Other than the teaser, details are scarce. We'll have to wait until 2025 to see more. Speaking of 2025, we also recently heard reports that Nintendo's Switch successor will come out no sooner than March of that year. For more Pokémon Legends, check out our review of Legends: Arceus, which we called "a worthwhile spin-off adventure."

I thought that it should not have been marketed as main game DLC instalment when it pivoted to being a magical girl dating sim. This serves to show how unrealistic dreams can be; in my waking hours I am, of course, of the clear-eyed awareness that a magical girl dating sim is entirely in-keeping with the rest of the Dragon Age oeuvre.
I'm worried about Dragon Age. I'm worried that so much cost has been sunk, team members changed and redrafting did that it'll end up kind of a mess. But that's the pessimism talking. What I'd like to propose is that all the big game companies have a crack at something similar to Amazon's (hiliarious and abortive) attempt to officially license fan fiction, which was called Kindle Worlds.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As someone who's learning Japanese, I crave other methods of language acquisition that don't feel like studying. Textbooks, flashcards, even watching Japanese media can all feel a bit too close to being back in a classroom. Shashingo, a game that helps you learn Japanese through taking cute photos, may be the study companion I've craved. And having covered it two years ago when it was first properly shown off, I'm very happy to see it's finally arriving later today.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Out of all the Nintendo Direct announcements last week, the one I was most sad to see not get a PC release date was the sequel to the much beloved Metroidvania Ender Lilies. The announcement came as a bit of a surprise, all told, and I was worried I'd have to consign it to what I've now dubbed my Unicorn Overlord pile of games that are never coming to PC. Happily, publishers Binary Haze Interactive have now confirmed that Ender Magnolia: Bloom In The Mist is, in fact, coming to PC (and other consoles) after all, and that it's coming real soon, as its PC early access release has been set for just weeks away on March 25th. Result.

This is a larger overhaul, encompassing a juicy mixture of balance and technical tweaks that together make this spring's breakout survival game easier to play, less buggy and, dare I say, a little kinder, with various tweaks aimed at making life more liveable both for trainers and Pals. I have run my eye over the changelog at the bottom of this page and picked out a few highlights, like somebody fishing a stray banknote from the laundry.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[“Ever since the very first Yakuza on PS2, the Like A Dragon series has always tried to capture the cultural zeitgeist of Japan, reflecting and satirising whatever’s trending around when the game comes out. This means that the way people speak in Like A Dragon is constantly evolving to match the times,” says Dan Sunstrum, senior translator at Ryu Ga Gotoku’s localisation team. Keeping things current is, says Sunstrum, “a challenge in some ways but also means we’re justified in using modern English slang to match, whereas such modernisms might feel out of place in a game set in a completely fictional world.”
Sunstrum uses an example from the studio’s latest, RPS Bestest Best winning RPG Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth, where permed protagonist Ichiban Kasuga meets a dating app designer. “The app’s creator goes on a mini-rant about ungrateful, entitled users, complaining how when anything goes wrong they’re quick to demand wabi-ishi,” slang for free premium currency. “This would have been a tricky word to localise, but it was made easy by the fact that fans of gacha games had already done it for us: they refer to them as ‘apologems’, and that’s what we ended up using in the game.”

However, it wasn’t until its 2019 release, 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim, that the developer’s name became synonymous with “you should play this team’s games.” It’s hard to tell what, exactly, made 13 Sentinels the breakout title for Vanillaware, shipping more than 1 million copies worldwide as of August last year, making it the studio’s best-selling title. The easy answer is probably its beloved story, both in how it plays out and how it’s infused into the game’s real-time strategy mech combat.
Publisher Atlus and Vanillaware released it in 2019, so when the team announced its latest title, Unicorn Overlord, last September, it was easy to conclude that this was the studio’s next big focus. And it is, but curi…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During last week’s Nintendo Direct: Partner Showcase, it was revealed that the 2021 action Metroidvania Ender Lilies: Quietus of the Knight is getting a sequel in the form of Ender Magnolia: Bloom of the Mist. The initial trailer provided a vague 2024 launch window, but we now know it's hitting Steam Early Access first on March 26. 
Ender Magnolia: Bloom in the Mist is set within the same universe as Ender Lilies but takes place in the magically saturated Land of Fumes. A mind-warping toxin has been unleashed from the magic-infused soil and dangerous Homunguli ravages the land. It’s up to protagonist Lilac, an “Attunder” capable of cleansing Homunguli, to save the day. You can check out the game's new trailer below.


Like Ender Lilies, Ender Magnolia is a dark fantasy Metroidvania in which Lilac is paired with another entity who actually handles the killing: a Spirit Reaper capable of killing Homunguli, which, in turn, adds their abilities to your arsenal. The sprawling 2D adventure tasks players with discovering hidden collectibles, gear, and items to bolster their ability to tackle a variety of bosses.
While it’s unknown exactly how long Ender Magnolia will be in Early Access, Ender Lilies also went through an Early Access phase that wound up working to the game's benefit. Ender Magnolia: Bloom in the Mist is slated to launch for PlayStation and Xbox platforms as well as Switch later this year. In the meantime, you can read our positive review of the Ender Lilies: Quietus of the Knight here.]]></summary>

My head fizzes with ideas for fiendish combos and deeply illegal hands. I'm delighted by its deserved success, with the makers boasting that it sold enough to become profitable within one hour then sold 250,000 copies in 72 hours. In a recent interview, the developer claims that part of why it's so damn successful is because they've barely played other roguelikelike deckbuilders so it's free to do its own thing outside genre conventions. What's interesting to me in this is how Balatro has built on a game which did influence it, the slot machine-building game Luck Be A Landlord.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sometimes I wonder whether every genre fantasy RPG or RPG-inflected game is essentially a journey towards the Big City. Most such games start you off on the periphery of the world, out in the sleepy and/or brutish hamlets of FirstActShire, Chosen One County, and send you on a loose quest towards the cosmopolitan centre, where you'll typically learn about the ultimate villain of the piece, gain access to the juiciest concentration of shops, crafting facilities and quest-givers, and glean some hint at the location of the endgame dungeon. Sometimes the quest takes days of playtime, as in Baldur's Gate 3. Sometimes it takes less than an hour, as in the original Destiny. It's a common-enough device that when an RPG starts you off in the Big City, like Dragon Age 2, or creatively "provincialises" the Big City, like Roadwarden, I feel slightly unnerved.

The studio, notable for its lovely story-driven games about forging personal connections in strange or difficult worlds - e.g. Mutazione and the more recent Saltsea Chronicles - was unable to find funding for its new project, after a year of searching, so is shutting up work. All of the staff, including the leadership team, will be looking for new work come mid-march.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nightingale’s dapper cast of cross-dimensional pathfinders are right about one thing: realmwalking is dangerous business. Attempt to tele-portal between realities on the Steam Deck, for instance, and you may find yourself trapped in the Stygian void, naught but a frozen loading screen tip for company and suspended hopelessly for all eternity. Or until you hold down the power button.
This crashing tendency alone means that while Nightingale can technically run on the Steam Deck, even without resorting to rock-bottom graphics settings, the current early access build isn’t yet ready for regular handheld play. That’s nothing developers Inflexion Games won’t tell you themselves – they’re "not considering [the Deck] officially supported at launch," after all – but if you were thinking of giving this gaslamp fantasy survival sim a portable whirl, you might want to let that call to adventure go unanswered.

It appeared during the Japanese version of the Partner Showcase, though, and the game quickly picked up steam online, thanks to its cool visual style, over-the-top action, and music by Final Fantasy XV composer Yoko Shimomura.

In addition to the previously revealed mountainsides and glacial snow peaks, it looks like Hinterberg will have a big green swamp to travel to as well. Question is: will it be a poison FromSoft variety of swamp? Or something more innocuous? Hard to tell with that searingly green water on display, but one thing is certain: with Elden Ring: Shadow Of The Erdtree and its confirmed poison swamp launching on June 21st, this summer won't be short on big bog energy.

        <updated>2024-02-26T13:58:56.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nier series creator Yoko Taro reportedly teased a third Nier game during the Nier: Orchestra Concert earlier this month. As reported by Eurogamer, during the concert, which celebrated the Nier series' music in London, Taro apparently made a surprise appearance and asked for people to clap and cheer as loudly as they could so that Square Enix president Takashi Kiryu – in attendance – could hear the demand for more Nier, according to one fan at the event. 
However, the biggest tease of the night came from an on-screen word that appeared multiple times throughout "the story of the show," SanTheSly, the fan in attendance, writes on ResetEra. 


"[The] word REPENT was shown repeatedly as part of some dialogue," SanTheSly writes. "The final instance was spelled as R3PENT. Both me and the person I'd gone with picked up on it and wondered if this was a tease." 
That sounds like a tease to us; otherwise, why else change the word "repent" to randomly feature a "3." However, some fans of the series already consider Nier Reincarnataion, a mobile gacha game shutting down in April, to be the third game in the series. On that timeline, Nier (and its remastered Nier: Replicant counterpart) is the first in the franchise and Nier: Automata the second. If Nier Reincarnation isn't the true third Nier game, perhaps Taro was teasing that could be on the way – Nier Repent does have a nice ring to it.

        <updated>2024-02-26T13:22:27.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Japanese outlet Nikkei is reporting that the Switch successor, or "Switch 2" as it's been dubbed colloquially within the games industry, is targeting a March 2025 launch, according to VideoGamesChronicle. This report follows earlier reporting from VGC and other outlets like Eurogamer that Nintendo's next console was originally targeting a 2024 launch before being pushed internally to the first quarter of 2025, which lines up with Nikkei's latest reporting. 


VGC reports that Nikkei writes, "Priority was given to ensure the initial inventory of the successor console and a lineup of software titles at the time of its launch" to curb the possibility of a stock shortage similar to what the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S experienced back in 2020. Following previous reports, Nikkei also writes that Nintendo's next console will be a hybrid home console-portable device like the Switch with a larger screen. 
Finally, Nikkei writes the internal target is March 2025 but that the Switch 2 could slip beyond that depending on manufacturing and the software available for the console's launch at that time, according to VGC. If it does launch in March of next year, it'd follow in the Switch's footsteps, which launched in March of 2017.
It's important to note that all of this should be taken with a grain of salt as these delays remain internal for the time being. The Switch's successor hasn't even been publicly revealed yet, so there's no telling when to expect it officially. In the meantime, though, read about how Nintendo reportedly demoed the Switch successor to developers at Gamescom last year.

I sternly and sorrowfully turned my back on such hit releases as Shadow of the Colossus, Far Cry and yes, even, that PC gaming essential Half-Life 2, so as to spend 11-hour days boning up on Aeschylus and Samuel Johnson. Then, two weeks before my final exams, I somehow went out and bought Ensemble's Age Of Mythology.
I'm not sure why - blame the devil on my shoulder, I guess. It wasn't even a new release at that point. I managed to get good marks in the exams despite several nights of binge-playing, but what direction, in general, would my life have taken if I hadn't bought Age Of Mythology at such a fateful hour? Better or worse? Could I have been some kind of billionaire don with a Pulitzer by now, if it weren't for Age Of Mythology? These things keep me awake at night. Anyway, here's a little more info about the forthcoming reboot Age of Mythology: Retold, which broadly aims to turn this wrinkled titan of the strategy genre into a proper modern esport.

It's the outcome many people predicted but one that could've been easily avoided.

During Capcom Cup X, we went hands on with Ed, the latest Street Fighter 6 DLC character, before he joins the fight this week.

This new look at the game's action features conversation from game producer and director Fumihiko Yasuda and animation lead Kosuke Wakamatsu discussing how Team Ninja approached the combat. They say it started with determining the different ideologies within Rōnin history, why certain individuals fought the way they did, and how that translates to a game aiming to be authentic to the Bakumatsu history. 
Check it the new Rise of the Rōnin gameplay for yourself below:

As we await Death Stranding 2: On The Beach, which is due out on PlayStation 5 in 2025, Disney Plus has dropped a documentary that might tide fans over. Titled Hideo Kojima: Connecting Worlds, this film "explores the creative process behind Hideo Kojima launching his independent studio up to the completion of Death Stranding."
It was announced last year before debuting at the 2023 Tribeca Film Festival but starting today, you can stream it on Disney Plus.

We haven't yet watched it but given Kojima's love of movies, we're excited to see what a documentary about the man himself is like. The release of Hideo Kojima: Connecting Worlds follows the debut of Grounded II: The Making of the Last of Us Part II, which also provided a behind-the-scenes look at video game development. 
For more, read Game Informer's Death Stranding review and then read about why Death Stranding Director's Cut is worth another trek across America. After that, watch the latest trailer for Death Stranding 2: On The Beach, which is expectedly weird.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Final Fantasy VII Rebirth hits PlayStation 5 exclusively on February 29, but reviews for Square Enix's latest entry in its Final Fantasy VII remake trilogy dropped yesterday. We enjoyed the game a lot, and you can read about why in Game Informer's Final Fantasy VII Rebirth review. It turns out, a lot of reviewers enjoyed the game too, because at the time of this writing, it's the second-highest rated game in the Final Fantasy series on Metacritic, as noted by video game sales analyst Benji-Sales on X (formerly Twitter). 
Currently sitting at a 93 on Metacritic, which aggregates various reviews into a single Metacritic score, only one other Final Fantasy game has been rated higher: Final Fantasy IX on PlayStation 1. It has a 94 on Metacritic.
There’s only 6 Final Fantasy games that have gone above a 90 Metacritic score.

February 22, 2024
As you can see above, with a 93 on Metacritic, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth joins a prestigious list of games in the series with a Metacritic score of 90 or higher, as pointed out by AndSpaceY on X. Now, it's important to note that some Final Fantasy games are not rated on Metacritic as the aggregate site was not around when they released. For example, Final Fantasy VI is one of the most beloved entries in the franchise and arguably the best – released in 1994 on the SNES, Metacritic was not around at the time so it does not have a rating on the site. 
Still, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth rating so high is another example of how Square Enix's Final Fantasy VII remake project is landing with both critics and fans alike.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League, the third-person live-service multiplayer shooter from Batman: Arkham series developer Rocksteady Studios, launched earlier this month. It received middling reviews – read Game Informer's review here to find out why we gave it a 6 out of 10 – and fans have been less-than-impressed with the shooter. It seems Warner Bros. Discovery is less-than-impressed, too, as the company said in its latest financial call that Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League had "fallen short of our expectations," as reported by IGN. 


More specifically, that's Warner Bros. Discovery chief financial officer Gunnar Wiedenfels who said Rocksteady's latest effort fell short of the company's expectations. However, Wiedenfels did not mention a sales figure. According to IGN, the executive lamented that Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League's missed expectations set Warner Bros.' games division up for a tough year when it comes to year-on-year comparisons.
Wiedenfels is likely alluding to Hogwarts Legacy, the company's massive hit that launched last year and went on to become the best-selling game of 2023, beating out titles like The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III. The sales of Hogwarts Legacy was certainly a tough act for Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League to follow. 
For more about the game, read Game Informer's review of Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League, and then check out Game Informer's list of the best superhero games of all time. After that, read our list of upcoming superhero games to look forward to.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Penny's Big Breakaway, the momentum-based 3D platformer from developer Evening Star, surprise launched earlier this week after appearing in a Partner Showcase Nintendo Direct. During a livestream held by Evening Star on the game's February 21 launch, one designer completed the first level with a single, two-minute combo, and it's a feat to behold. 
If you haven't yet checked out Penny's Big Breakaway, it's a 3D platformer modeled off the strange and weird platformers of the PlayStation 1 generation, rather than Nintendo's popular platforming efforts. As such, the game features a unique moveset that feels similar to Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, with a Devil May Cry combo meter to boot. 
Check out the Evening Star developer reach a massive 191-move combo in the first stage of Vanillatown, the first world in Penny's Big Breakaway, below: 
Vanillatown 1-1 100% in just 1 combo!?

February 22, 2024
As you can see, this designer – Milena – completes the first level with one continuous combo. We're not sure we're quite up to the task but we wouldn't be surprised if fans of the game spend time outcomboing this score. Only time will tell. 
Penny's Big Breakaway is now available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s been a long time since Little Devil Inside, a promising survival action RPG from indie developer Neostream, has made any noise. The game’s last substantial update came in October 2021. But after over two years of silence, Neostream has come back with a new trailer and cryptic update hinting at what’s been going on with the team.
As reported by The Indie Informer, Neostream’s Kickstarter post, published yesterday, apologizes for the lack of updates and cryptically alludes to an internal conflict within the team, potentially due to clashing visions about the game, being one of the causes. It states in part,
The rest of Neostream's update indicates the team has reduced in size but confirms that the founders and core members remain at the studio. The studio assures backers that Little Devil Inside still exists and that it is currently discussing publishing before it can give fans a more substantial update. Until then, the team has prepared a six-minute montage video showing off the game running in Unreal Engine 5.


Little Devil Inside was first revealed way back in 2015 with the launch of its Kickstarter campaign, but it gained its first mainstream recognition as part of the 2020 PlayStation 5 showcase prior to the console's launch. You play as an explorer who embarks on research mission at the behest of a university professor to explore a large world filled with beasts both real and supernatural. You'll visit different towns along the way to meet quirky citizens, defend yourself from threats with a sword, and engage in survival mechanics like camping and cooking. Despite how much time as past, we ultimately still know relatively little about Little Devil Inside but it has remained a charmer each time it resurfaces. 
Little Devil Inside has no release window but we're hoping to learn more concrete details in the near future.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlayStation VR2 launched in February of last year and while its debut featured new first-party titles like Horizon Call of the Mountain, our favorites on the new platform featured previously released titles like Resident Evil Village. Since that launch, support for the platform has been sparse, to say the least, especially from PlayStation itself. However, Sony has revealed it is currently testing PC support for PS VR2, with hopes to make that support available this year. 
"[We're] pleased to share that we are currently testing the ability for PS VR2 players to access additional games on PC to offer even more game variety in addition to the PS VR2 titles available through PS5," a new PlayStation Blog post published today reads. "We hope to make this support available in 2024, so stay tuned for more updates."


The rest of the blog goes on to detail new and upcoming titles coming to PS VR2, but those are going to be playable with PlayStation 5 consoles. However, it sounds like PC support, which could open up a flood gate for new VR content, might arrive later this year. 
For more about the hardware, read Game Informer's PS VR2 review, and then read Game Informer's Horizon Call of the Mountain review. After that, read about why Resident Evil Village is the PS VR2's best exclusive, and then check out these 10 games to play using your VR headset.

This is called “bus bunching,” and I bet you’ve seen it happen in OpenTTD – and not just with buses.

Access real devices with Device Streaming in Android Studio

Device streaming in Android Studio lets you securely connect to remote physical Android devices hosted in Google's secure data centers. Powered by Firebase, it's the fastest and easiest way to test your app against real devices, including the Google Pixel 8 Pro, Pixel Fold, select Samsung devices, and more.

After connecting to a device, you can deploy your app, view the display, interact with the device (including rotating or unfolding the device), and anything else you might do with a device over a direct ADB over SSL connection—all without leaving Android Studio. When you're done using the device, Google wipes all your data and factory resets the device before making it available to another developer.
During Open Alpha, you can use Device Streaming at no cost. To get started simply sign into your Developer account from Android Studio and select a Firebase project. If you don't already have a Firebase project, it's easy to create one. To learn more, go to Device Streaming in Android Studio.
