        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[How many times can we say "funk" in one article? You might be surprised.
A modern sequel to Dreamcast's Jet Set Radio may never truly exist, but the radical funktastic torch is borne on by Bomb Rush Cyberfunk, which channels early-2000s vibes with its skatefunk-graffiti-punk, or a new genre we're going to affectionately call "funkpunk".
The new trailer, like all the trailers before it, focuses on the sun-drenched colours and vibrant street art of Bomb Rush's alleyways, along with a new song from the game's composer Hideki Naganuma, who was also the composer for Jet Set Radio.

The first in the line of Arcade1Up's Pro Series cabinets features a handful of games, centered around Rare's classic fighter, Killer Instinct. What makes the Pro Series stand apart from its contemporaries isn't its slate of games, though; it's the construction of the cabinet itself.
Arcade1Up's traditional home arcade machines stand somewhere between 47" and 57" tall, depending on whether you have it sitting on the height-boosting riser.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nobody Saves The World, the upcoming action RPG from Guacamelee developers Drinkbox Studios, has a release date and it’s less than two weeks away. 
More specifically, it will be released on January 18 and as previously announced, it will hit Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC via Windows 10 and Steam for $24.99. However, if you’re an Xbox Game Pass subscriber or a member of Microsoft’s PC Game Pass, the game will hit those services on day one, meaning you can download them for free.

Hopefully, you’ve got a friend lined up to play Nobody Saves The World with, too, because the game features online co-op, although it does not feature cross-play so you’ll need to be on the same platform as your friend to play together. 
In Nobody Saves The World, you control a “featureless nobody” that can transform into a variety of different animals and creatures, including a slug, a ghost, a dragon, a rat, a robot, and much more. You’ll need to swap between over 15 different forms with mixed and matched abilities to unlock and complete quests to progress through the game’s narrative. 
Speaking of abilities, Drinkbox says there are over 80 different Form abilities, meaning each player will likely have their own customized build that works best for them. You might play as an egg that leaves a trail of slime behind you or a rat that shoots fireballs – the choice is up to you. 
If you’re interested in the soundtrack, which was created by composer Jim Guthrie (Below, Sword and Sorcery), it will be available for purchase on Steam and other platforms when the game is released on January 18. 
Nobody Saves The World was announced back in March and it quickly gained traction as yet another exciting title from Drinkbox. For more, watch this New Gameplay Today segment about the game.

Although the video doesn’t update players on when Bomb Rush Cyberfunk will drop, it does provide a glimpse into some of the cool moves you can pull off. Whether you’re tearing up the city on a pair of skates, a bike, or a skateboard, executing stylish rail grinds and nailing combos is not only fun but vital to progression. The crux of the game is tagging enough spots with your graffiti and out-tricking other crews to earn enough reputation to challenge them for territory control. Mastering traversal also matters for reaching hidden areas of the city that may contain secrets.

If this modern homage has you chomping at the bit to play it, developer Team Reptile promises in the video's description that it's “going in hard” to get Bomb Rush Cyberfunk out the door this year. The game is slated to arrive on Switch and PC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Marvel’s Spider-Man on PlayStation 4 was a real treat and its remastered version on PlayStation 5 was even better. Despite how great it feels to play as Peter Parker in both versions, one thing neither version could do was really put you behind the Spider-Man mask. 
However, one player has come up with a unique way to give people a way to see what the game looks like through Peter Parker’s eyes: stop-motion.

As you can see in YouTube video above, creator ItIsSpid decided to take on a daunting task to show us what swinging through Insomniac Games’ New York City is like on PlayStation 5, both via Peter Paker and Miles Morales, and it looks amazing. We’re treated to a minute and 40 seconds of hundreds of first-person screenshots (courtesy of the games’ impressive photo modes) and we’ve never wanted a first-person Spider-Man game more. 
Of course, it takes a couple of seconds for your eyes to adjust to the stop-motion effect but when it sings, it looks great. 
“Using Spider-Man PS5/Miles Morales PS5 photo mode, I decided to try and combine 850+ photos and make a first-person gameplay stop-motion,” ItIsSpid’s YouTube description reads. 
For more, check out our reviews of these two games in Game Informer’s Marvel’s Spider-Man review and Game Informer’s Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales review. Be sure to check out this reveal of Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 after that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's keen to make a splash.
Cast your mind back to the original concept trailer for Nintendo Switch (or watch it above, up to you). Nintendo had shown photogenic people playing Switch in the park, on a plane, at rooftop parties, and also in esports. Though Nintendo has generally gone for a relatively low-effort approach to pushing its role in esports, avoiding a great deal of the pesky work and monetary investments, it has been slowly trying to do more. In the grand vision of late 2016 it was Splatoon 2 that would play out in a packed arena of excited fans, as Nintendo evidently envisioned big things for the franchise.
That didn't happen, for a broad combination of reasons, but the game was a success. It was certainly meatier than its experimental Wii U original, offering more content and options for solo or co-op play. The competitive multiplayer, of course, became the long-term focus for many, and you can still find players battling it out online with terrifying rankings.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The musou genre is a long-spanning one with dozens of entries in it, but despite that, it has remained relatively niche in the grand scheme of things. 
However, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild has helped buck that trend as Omega Force has revealed (on Twitter) that its Zelda musou, Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity, has shipped a whopping 4 million units since its release back in November of 2020. Of course, “shipped” is very different than “sold,” as this new statistic doesn’t necessarily indicate 4 million people have purchased the game, but manufacturers aren’t going to ship a game to storefronts when said storefronts have plenty in stock.

January 5, 2022
So while Age of Calamity hasn’t sold 4 million units, it has likely sold millions, which must be exciting for Omega Force. The team had to pull off quite the feat to make it a success, as creating a prequel to Breath of the Wild, one of the most celebrated games of all time, is no easy task. Omega Force even went a step further and created an expansion pass for Age of Calamity that furthered the prequel story by adding in controllable guardians, new weapons, and a rideable motorcycle to use in-game. These expansions also brought a new “Apocalyptic” difficulty to the musou as well as new challenges in the Royal Ancient Lab, new enemies, and more. 
For more about Age of Calamity, read this feature on why Omega Force made this musou a prequel in the first place, and then check out our thoughts on the game in Game Informer’s Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity review.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Skull & Bones has lost a co-director. 
First reported by Video Games Chronicle, Antoine Henry recently revealed on LinkedIn that he's departing from Ubisoft after working for nearly 15 years at the company. Henry says he's onto "new exciting adventures" very soon, which is great. Still, his departure from the company's Singapore studio serves as yet another loss for the Skull & Bones team, which has seemingly struggled to make any headway since its 2017 reveal. 
Game Informer chronicled Skull & Bones' journey through development hell recently in Part 1 of our Video Games Stuck In Development Hell series (here's Part 2 and Part 3 if you're curious for more). In short, this nautical game was last seen by the public in 2018 – we went hands-on with it that year. There was even a beta players w…]]></summary>

The Switch has some rather good options in the visual novel genre, and a new arrival today also looks rather promising. Arcadia Fallen, from Danish development team Galdra Studios, makes its console debut on Switch later today (5th January), arriving at 2pm UK / 3pm CEST in Europe and 9am Pacific / noon Eastern in North America.
As for what this game offers, on the one hand it seems to have a good-sized and talented voiceover cast, which was made possible through a Kickstarter campaign. In addition it's a visual novel that gives the player a great deal of agency, with roleplay elements that allow you to define your character, their personality and their relationships with others.

So, it's only natural that Sucker Punch's visually stunning action/adventure game would find the same success as the samurai flicks that inspired it. Ghost of Tsushima is as popular as ever, with 8 million copies sold. 
We're thrilled and amazed that #GhostOfTsushima has officially sold more than 8 million copies!

January 5, 2022
A recent tweet (seen above) revealed the game's newest milestone: "We're thrilled and amazed that Ghost of Tsushima has officially sold more than 8 million copies! Thank you so much to everyone who has played since launch! We are so incredibly appreciative and grateful for the support!" 
It's no surprise that Ghost of Tsushima had such a sizable player base. Cutting-edge graphics (somehow made more impressive with the PlayStation 5's Director's Cut), fluid combat mechanics with flashy animations, and a story/game world inundated in Japanese culture and samurai lore help set Ghost of Tsushima apart from its contemporaries. Game Informer's Matt Miller loved the vanilla game, awarding it a 9.5. In his impression piece on the Director's Cut, he echoed the same shining sentiments from his original review while speaking to the added content:
"I was happily surprised by the breadth, depth, and challenge of the Iki Island expansion. For new players, it will extend an already lengthy adventure into something more. Meanwhile, returning players should be thrilled at how well this experience dovetails out of an already stellar game. Iki Island is what I want out of single-player game expansions. And it's further proof (as if we needed any more at this point) that Sucker Punch has a standout new property to continue building on."
I've been playing through the Director's Cut myself and am completely enamored with Ghost of Tsushima's art direction and overall vibe. What are your thoughts on Sucker Punch's latest IP? Let us know down below!]]></summary>

There aren't many indie titles as popular and as loved as Stardew Valley – and for good reason, it's rather excellent – but with a brand new game on the way, will its developer Eric 'ConcernedApe' Barone have any time or inclination to provide further updates?
Already an impressive game from the off on Switch, Stardew Valley was last treated to major update almost a year ago, when its long-awaited version 1.5 update dropped in February 2021. It's seen smaller tweaks since then, but with the game now being packed full of features and with Barone's next intriguing project Haunted Chocolatier now in development, it'd be easy to assume that Stardew's evolution has come to an end.

It's back now with improved visuals, re-recorded music and dialogue, and all your favourite baffling moon logic puzzles that require the use of thinking so divorced from rationality that it's really the acquired taste of acquired tastes. A lot of people aren't going to get it, and it's pretty difficult to fault them for that. It's an issue more or less endemic to the point-and-click adventure genre, with surprisingly few exceptions. We think it's fair to say that it's the personality and humour that draws people to these games - and Sam & Max certainly has plenty of personality. As for the humour? That can be a little harder to swallow.

If you’ve watched any of Sony Pictures Entertainment’s marketing for its upcoming Uncharted movie, then you’re likely aware that it has its own take on the infamous cargo plane scene from the third installment of the video game series. 
In one of the highlights of Uncharted 3: Drake’s Deception, protagonist Nathan Drake attempts to crawl from one cargo piece to the next, back to the safety of a plane. Things don’t end well for him as the plane comes to a fiery crash, leaving Drake stranded in a desert. Sony’s upcoming Uncharted movie, which stars Tom Holland as Drake and Mark Wahlberg as mentor and right-hand man Victor “Sully” Sullivan, features a very similar cinematic, and after being teased throughout multiple trailers, the full sequence has been r…]]></summary>

With the recent end of the Nintendo Minute show, Nintendo of America's YouTube channel is currently limited to its Nintendo Power Podcast and Monthly Rewind videos in terms of relatively unique content. Of course marvellous showcases like Indie World and Nintendo Direct broadcasts shake things up too, but in terms of developing personalities and regular viewers it wouldn't surprise us if another weekly or monthly show is devised this year.
In any case, the Monthly Rewind videos are often a good watch as summaries, reminding us in this case that December was relatively busy and interesting from a Nintendo perspective. This was driven by the Indie World broadcast, but we also had game award success for Metroid Dread to celebrate. And Pokémon stuff, the narrator says Pokémon a lot.

Way back in the '90s, you couldn't move for 2D fighting games from the likes of Capcom, SNK and Data East. The genre was one of the biggest draws around, and while one-on-one fighting games have enjoyed something of a fall and rise since then, they're not quite at the insane level of popularity they were during the 16 and 32-bit eras.
Still, if you're pining for some classic 2D fighting action in 2022, then you might want to take a look at FightNJokes, which has just arrived on the Switch eShop. It's described as "a semi-humorous 2D fighting game created from original IP while taking a gentle poke at the more serious sides of Fighting Games".

Lawrence Schwedler spent over 13 years at Nintendo Software Technology as an audio director, composing music for games like Metroid Prime Hunters on the DS, Wave Race: Blue Storm on the GameCube, Pokémon Puzzle League on N64 and even the Chibi Robo series.
While it was "great and happy" most of the time, in a recent interview with the Kiwi Talkz podcast, Schwedler acknowledged how his job at Nintendo was also resulted in some of the most stressful times of his life due to pressures, expectations and other factors in play.

That happened again today in a small way. If you explore slightly to the northeast of Logjam Lumberyard, you'll find a new circular patch of dirt just beyond a hill. Investigating the scene reveals a large driller protected by IO guards at a landmark called Mole Team: Omega. That's right, the Imagined Order (better known as IO) is back and it appears they drilled through the island.
Odds are we'll see more IO troops on the island in the days and weeks ahead, likely culminating in a new story development. There's a chance it could tie into The Foundation unlockables countdown, which currently sits at 30 days.
If you want to check out the drilling site, make sure you bring a weapon, as IO will open fire the second they see you. Look for a tent and you'll find a large weapon cache. A launcher awaits on the far side of the dirt pile, so you should be able to make a quick getaway after getting the rare loot.
I can't wait to see where Epic goes with this next. We're still waiting for tornadoes and that strange six-legged purple monster to show up, but the arrival of IO is a nice surprise that should lead to a new antagonist showing up soon.]]></summary>

My days at work were mostly spent alone in a dark projection booth above a corporate auditorium. To spice up my evenings and force some human interaction on myself, I started playing Magic: The Gathering at a local game shop. I spent multiple days a week there, learning how to draft, build decks, and catch onto the lingo and language of the game. Slowly, I incorporated myself into the small group of regulars, and day by day, I felt less alone.
While shuffling decks and slinging spells against these new acquaintances, I noticed shared mannerisms and social archetypes people took on within my little corner of the Magic community. Let me tell you how pleasantly surprised …]]></summary>

The mods for Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade started rolling in shortly after its troubled PC release last month, but I certainly did not expect someone to go full sicko and give Sephiroth the Ronald McDonald make-over.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been covering sports games for more than a decade now, and I've been playing them for nearly three times that long. Whenever I talk to anyone about the latest middling entry in Madden NFL or NBA 2K, the first question I always receive is, "Should I buy this one if I already own last year's?" I used to have to think more about whether I'd recommend a sports gamer pick up the latest iteration, but over the last several years, the games have felt just that way: iterative. Now, my answer is always, "How important is [this year's tentpole feature] to you? How important is having the latest rosters?" If even one of those is wishy-washy, my answer is either "Wait for a sale" or "Just play last year's game." This song and dance has only become more noticeable as the years have continued.

While the nail polishes and the colors they come in look quite nice, there’s another interesting aspect to this collaboration.

Ride or shoot in style with the best-looking nails your controller has ever seen. 
As for the in-game content, the Xbox Wire blog post revealing this collaboration doesn’t exactly spell out what it is, but some pictures reveal that the collection gets you a Halo Infinite armor coating and what appears to be a skin for a car in Forza Horizon 5 (although it could be straight up an entire car).

The original Mortal Kombat and its successors will always have a key role in video game history, with the gore and violence of the arcade original famously being toned down in its Super Nintendo port. The early arcades and assorted ports are classics, and an upcoming Arcade1Up release looks like it'll be a fun way to play them (albeit with a price tag in the hundreds of dollars).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Halo Infinite's shop updates every Tuesday at 10 a.m. PT with new items that players can purchase with credits. Since the launch of the free-to-play multiplayer component, 343 Industries has done a nice job of offering up colorful items for players to purchase. The latest rotation doesn't have much other than one cool item that ties into the return of the Fracture: Tenrai event.
The expensive item of the week is a 2,000 credit ($17.99) legendary mythic effect set called Enlightened Path, which adds pink rose petals to your Spartan's footsteps, slides, and spawns. Also included in this bundle is a white mask called Grand Play that can be applied to your nameplate, armor, vehicles, and weapons. I have to point out that the price for this bundle is ridiculous, especially since the player usually gets an armor set at this rate.
The more interesting offering this week is the Meditative State bundle, with the standout piece being the Imperial Crest helmet attachment for the Yoroi armor core earned in the Fracture: Tenrai event. This set also offers a cool coloring option called Expressive Soul which adds samurai-like highlights to the armor in gold and green. The bundle is rounded out with a triumphant stance called Mirror Tale, and an epic charm called Black Opal. This pack is 1,000 credits.
If you want to focus on your weapons and pick up another high-priced bundle, the Blacksteel Katana set is rather striking, adding a dragon scale effect to the MA40 assault rifle. You also get Black Cat weapon coloring, a Tiger Energy charm, and a Sun and Shadow icon to apply to weapons, vehicles, and more.
The item of the day is the Desert Sun bundle, offering the Ryuu visor for the Yoroi armor, and a dull green armor coating called Forgotten Sands.
All told, this week's offerings rank among the game's worst to date. The good news, though, is Fracture: Tenrai is back and we can keep working on that battle pass.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you’re an Apex Legends fan that’s been wanting more out of the game’s lore, Respawn has released a new installment in its Stories from the Outlands series centered on fan-favorite Bangalore. 
For those new to Stories from the Outlands, the series expands on the game’s lore by shining a narrative spotlight on its roster of Legends. Think of them as Respawn’s take on Blizzard’s Overwatch shorts. Gridiron sees Bangalore get torn between her responsibilities as a soldier and the relationship with her brother after the Battle of Gridiron. Clocking in at over eight minutes, the well-animated cinematic is a neat way of fleshing out of the game’s original favorites.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Death Stranding Director’s Cut for PC has been announced and it’s coming sometime this Spring. 
It’s being published by 505 Games, the same publishing arm that published the original version of Death Stranding on PC last July, and will be released simultaneously on Steam and the Epic Game Store. This news was announced during Intel’s showcase during the ongoing Consumer Electronics Show today and Kojima Production’s latest game will take advantage of Intel’s XeSS supersampling technology. 
Released last September as a PlayStation 5 exclusive, the Director’s Cut features everything contained in the original version of Death Stranding, which first hit PlayStation 4 exclusively in 2019 before it hit PC in 2020, as well as graphical and performance-related improvements, new mechanics, and new …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The vanguard of Intel’s 12th Gen Alder Lake CPUs had some seriously good chips in it – including two of the best CPUs for gaming overall – though there weren’t many models for aspiring PC builders on tight budgets. Now, though, Intel has used CES 2022 to launch the rest of the 12th Gen desktop lineup, adding loads of more affordable Core i5 and Core i3 processors on top of new Core i7 and Core i9 options. Intel also unveiled its new H-series, 12th Gen gaming laptop chips, which use the same hybrid architecture (combining powerful P-cores with smaller, less energy-intensive E-cores) as their Alder Lake desktop cousins.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Admittedly, it'd take very little for me to be on board with a Death Stranding Director's Cut. It only needed to be more Death Stranding for me to be sold on revisiting Hideo Kojima's latest vanity project. Luckily for me, that's exactly what the Director's Cut is. I love the original release, and this is a perfect excuse to dive back in. I think you should play it, too. But maybe not for the reasons you think. 
Death Stranding Director's Cut is pitched as an expanded version of the base game that came out in 2019, the definitive version of Kojima's vision. After 26 hours – and much, much more still to go – my knee-jerk impression is that the Director's Cut moniker is marketing spiel more than anything. Still, there are some fun and creative new additions that enhance the overall experienc…]]></summary>

At the end of Persona 5, we parted ways with a terrific cast of characters we grew to love over the course of a 100-hour story. Last year’s Persona 5 Royal gave us an excuse to revisit that same adventure with additional content, but fans yearned for an all-new journey. Persona 5 Strikers reunites the cast from the original game six months later for an all-new trip across Japan. Even though it drastically changes a few key elements of the experience, it still feels like a true, compelling continuation of the game that stole RPG fans’ hearts nearly four years ago.

Their freshly-announced hardware includes an assortment of new CPUs, desktop and mobile graphics cards and even some laptop APUs – APUs that sound a lot more useful for gaming that what current integrated graphics can offer. There’s even an Nvidia Image Scaling rival in the upcoming, driver-level Radeon Super Resolution feature.

Announced at The Game Awards 2021, Nightingale is a survival craft 'em up set in a fantastical, alt-history world. It's being made by Inflexion Games, a studio lead by Aaryn Flynn, former programmer and general manager at the Dragon Age and Mass Effect developers. 
But don't go in expecting the sort of huge, arcing plotlines of BioWare's recent games. While Nightingale will have an over-arching narrative, it's being designed to offer up adventures that let you make your own stories. I spoke to Flynn at the end of last year to find out a little bit more about what that entails.

As Final Fantasy XIV players know, a patch like 6.05 isn’t just any patch – it's packed with new things for players to do and obtain. A quick scroll through the expansive list of patch notes reveals that to be true, too, as the new update features all kinds of additions like a new version of a raid, a treasure dungeon, new minions and mounts, and of course, some fixes and improvements as well.

        <updated>2022-01-04T14:17:11.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you really enjoy anime and games based on popular anime titles, then there’s a good chance you’re already a fan of CyberConnect 2. That’s because that’s the developer behind games like Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba, Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4, and Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot. 
During a recent “Piro-Live! New Year’s Eve Special 2022” livestream, as reported by Gematsu, CyberConnect2 president and CEO Hiroshi Matsuyama said that all three of those games have sold really well, revealing the worldwide sales numbers for each (which frankly, speak for themselves): 
Click here to watch embedded media



	
Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4, first released in 2016, has sold more than 8.7 million units worldwide 
Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot, first released in January of 2020, has sold more than 4.5 million units worldwide 
Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba – The Hinokami Chronicles, its most recent title released back in October, has sold more than 1.32 million units worldwide. 
Building off of that momentum, CyberConnect2 is ready to reveal its next game next month. According to Gematsu, Matsuyama said during the livestream that the team will announce a new game in February, with a planned release for it in the Summer. The CEO also said that the new title will definitely get people talking, and that it’s a game that “promises to be something that will shake the world,” Gematsu writes. 
Perhaps it’s a new game based on a very popular anime, or maybe the studio is returning to the .hack series it was first made famous for. Speaking of the .hack series, Matsuyama said the company is preparing for the 20th anniversary of it in June. 
While waiting to see what CyberConnect2 announces next month, check out Game Informer’s Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot review, and then read this feature breaking down everything you need to know about Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba – The Hinokami Chronicles.

The suit started in 2018 following widespread allegations of a festering workplace culture, and was originally due to be settled for $10 million (£7m) until California state authorities raised objections that it wasn't enough.

There’s also always an opportunity for a company to create a new game in a franchise to make some money, and while I recognize that’s exactly why a fourth BioShock game is in development, it’s hard to stop myself from growing more and more excited about what it might be. 
BioShock Infinite, the last in the series, was released in 2013, and at the earliest, the next one, now in development at 2K’s new Cloud Chamber studio, hits next year. That’s a massive nine-year gap, which has hopefully given those at Cloud Chamber enough time to stir on what a new BioShock game needs and doesn’t need – it has for me, at least.

PlayStation announced earlier this week that Deep Rock Galactic, as well as Persona 5 Strikers and Dirt 5, will be the January 2022 PlayStation Plus titles, and now, new details about one of the games have been released. 
As first reported by VG247, Deep Rock Galactic will contain some PlayStation 5-exclusive features thanks to the console's DualSense controller. More specifically, the DualSense touchpad can be used to control the Terrain Scanner in-game. Plus, the controller's built-in speaker can be used by characters to tell you orders as if said characters are actually using a radio to communicate with you, as one might do when mining deep into an alien planet's terrain.

Shortly after, he closed the doors of Irrational Games, a studio he started in 1997. Most of the staff was let go, on short notice no less, but a handful of developers were hand-picked to join his new smaller studio startup, Ghost Story Games. 
That new studio, still under the helm of 2K and parent company Take-Two Interactive, began work on a new game – it’s that narrative Legos one Levine talked about years and years ago – in 2014. Now, eight years later, not a trace of that game has been seen by the public and a new report from Bloomberg reveals why.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s no surprise that Spider-Man No Way Home – the third film in Sony’s Tom Holland-led franchise – has reached impressive critical and financial heights. Fans have been waiting for a live-action Multiverse movie since Into the Spiderverse, and No Way Home continues to serve as the perfect answer to that enthusiasm. The movie garnered positive feedback from viewers and handily surpassed the box office numbers of every 2021 film. As of right now, No Way Home is Sony’s most successful movie of all time. And, according to Hollywood Reporter, it’s the first pandemic-era film to amass more than $1 billion at the box office. 
Deadline reported in December 2021 that No Way Home could ultimately come away with a $610 million net profit, which would boast higher numbers than Homecoming and Far From Home. This estimate might not be far-fetched because, on Christmas Eve, the latest web-slinger movie became Sony’s top-grossing domestic title ever. And as long as theaters stay open (who knows what the future may hold now that the omicron strain is spreading like wildfire), No Way Home will undoubtedly continue its staggering financial success this year. 
In his most daring adventure yet, Peter Parker and Doctor Strange accidentally tear open Multiverse doorways, bringing franchise-favorite villains like Doctor Octopus, Green Goblin, and Electro into the fray. This might be the most ambitious Spider-Man movie, but it won’t be the last time we see Tom Holland in the skin-tight suit, as the British star may appear in three more films. 
In Spider-Man games news, No Way Home-inspired skins are available in Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered, while Spider-Man and MJ cosmetics have launched in Fortnite. And if you want more MCU info, check out the new trailer for Doctor Strange’s In The Multiverse of Madness movie.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hideo Kojima ended up tweeting his 2022 plans a week after the release of the Famitsu's New Year's ambitions feature, only this time he's clarified some of what he may be working on. Kojima Tweeted this on January 1, saying, "This year, I'm going to start a new work in earnest, and move to the next level of experimentation with a radical project. I'm also hoping to get the video team going. And I may start doing something like a radio project?"
So, Hideo looks to be working on four main projects in different levels of development and progress. Two of which appear to be games or at least games-related in the "new work" he's beginning, and the "radical project" that's evolving more this year. The other two, though, are happening in the video and audio space, both of which I can see the Metal…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Japanese publication Famitsu released its annual list of New Year’s cards from a range of the nation's developers/publishers. It allows companies the chance to thank fans for their support over the last year, tease upcoming projects, and share success stories of recently released titles. In Atlus’ case, its message reveals that the recently released Shin Megami Tensei V has performed very well during its short lifespan while planting seeds for its next title.
So far, over 800,000 copies of Shin Megami Tensei V have been sold. Atlus states this is a cumulative sales number, implying digital sales are accounted for. This makes SMT V the best-selling entry in the long-running series despite only launching less than two months ago, shattering Shin Megami Tensei IV’s lifetime sales of 600,000+. 
The publisher has an eventful 2022 ahead, namely, celebrating Persona’s 25th anniversary. We already know that Persona 4 Arena Ultimax comes to modern platforms in March, but Atlus teases other surprises are in store. Lastly, Atlus states it has an unannounced project is in the works. 
Couple this news with the upcoming Switch port of the well-received 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim, and Atlus is sitting pretty heading into the new year. Shin Megami Tensei V's success is great to hear, though not entirely surprising. After all, it was one of our runner-ups for The Best RPG of 2021, which you can read all about here.

Last month, famed author George R.R. Martin, who collaborated with From Software to create the foundation and lore of Elden Ring, wrote that the game looks “incredible” in a blog post. Thanks to a new Edge Magazine interview with Elden Ring director Hidetaka Miyazaki, it seems the recent Bluepoint Games remake of Demon’s Souls on PlayStation 5 helped make From’s latest look great.

The RE 2 and 3 Remakes are third-person experiences, but the high-quality graphics, tight action controls, and unkillable Mr. X and Nemesis create that same sense of dread that the latest entries are known for. The Remakes beg to be played in VR, and one great modder did just that. 
According to Kotaku, praydog has been developing VR ports for both Remakes for quite some time. Modder praydog’s attention to detail is particularly striking as the full-motion controls make the games’ conventional weapons feel physical. Swinging the knife as rotting zombies…]]></summary>

Game Informer even spoke to Takashi Iizuka, the head of Sonic Team and longtime series designer, director, and producer, about the anniversary. Now, thanks to a new Q&A segment during an investor call, we know the team initially had even more planned for the 30th anniversary. 
First reported by Sonic Stadium, Sonic Frontiers was planned as a 2021 release to coincide with the blue blur’s birthday celebration, but in the end, the team needed more time on the upcoming open-zone game.

We do our best to rescue others from harm, to avert world-ending disasters, and give everyone around us the happy ending they deserve. But if there's one thing I've learned about myself in 2021, it's that I'm a cruel, heartless robot who will happily toss others under the bus if they don't provide any material benefit to me. Or at least I am when I'm playing Unsighted, the gorgeous and criminally underrated action RPG from Studio Pixel Punk that puts a ticking time-bomb inside each of its characters' metallic chests which, if left unchecked, will remove them from the game entirely, preventing you from gaining some potentially very handy upgrades to help you in your quest to fight back against your human oppressors. 
It's an ingenious system, as you're not only fighting against the hordes of enemies that appear onscreen, but your own ineptitude.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Happy new year! Season 2 of Game Informer's Video Gameography podcast examines one of the biggest shooter franchises in existence: Halo. This week, we unpack Bungie's epic conclusion to Master Chief's original trilogy of adventures: Halo 3.
Released with all the hype in the world on September 25, 2007, Halo 3 served as both the pinnacle of the series as well as its supposed swan song for Master Chief. Using the now iconic tagline "finish the fight," Bungie created Halo 3 under the agreement that it would part ways with Microsoft after a new set of Halo games. The third game was the first of this batch, and its creation suffered from internal studio conflicts, including creative heads walking out mid-development. How did Bungie cope with matching Halo 2's quality, migrating to a new platform in the Xbox 360, and delivering a conclusion that lived up to expectations? Tune in to find out. 
Join hosts Ben Reeves (@BenjaminReeves), Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), and Game Informer video editor Alex Stadnik (@Studnik76) as we unpack the history and impact of Master Chief's grand sequel. And for more Halo, be sure to check out our definitive ranking of every Halo game.

First reported by Kotaku, Mint Blitz originally set out to win 50 consecutive free-for-all matches in the recently-released (and free-to-play) multiplayer portion of Halo Infinite. After winning 50 in a row, though, he upped the ante and sought to win 100 consecutive matches…and he did it. In fact, he continued on to win even more, finally breaking the streak around “105, 106 straight” wins.

Gone are the overly complicated plot points, invasive loot box rewards, and ability kit-focused metas. 343 Industries’ latest installment is a lesson on finding balance in simple storytelling and leveling the competitive playing field. It’s also a revolutionary step that’ll undoubtedly inform the next generation of Halo projects. Read more...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This year was a great one for Koei Tecmo, which was behind several releases by way of either development or publishing, but the studio is teeing up 2022 to be even better. 
First reported and translated by Twinfinite, Japanese website 4Gamer published an article about 2022 plans for local game developers, including Koei Tecmo. In it, Koei Tecmo’s entertainment division general manager, Yosuki Hayashi, says the studio will reveal several games that have been in the works for years in 2022, stating that these titles “will pave the way for the future of the company,” Twinfinite writes.

Hayashi says the “full power of the current Koei Tecmo” will be shown in 2022 and that the year will mark the release of several games developed by the studio. As for what, Team Ninja director Fumihiko Yasuda said fans can look forward to future titles such as an action game set in the Three Kingdom era and another game that he’s actually directing. 
Finally, Fatal Frame producer Yosuke Kikuchi said that in 2022, “his team will challenge the development of something that they have never done before,” according to Twinfinite’s translation and that while it will be a long time before it’s formally announced, the studio is excited to get started. 
Perhaps 2022 will bring a new Nioh game to consoles and PC, or maybe even a new Fatal Frame, especially since the last one was released in 2015. Check out our thoughts on it in Game Informer’s Fatal Frame: Maiden of Black Water review and then read Game Informer’s Nioh 2 review after that.

Don’t get me wrong; I’ve enjoyed my time with Fortnite and Apex Legends, the two titles I’ve dabbled with the most. They’re well-crafted games. But each of them also occupies the same niche being shooters. I’m itching for more creative spins on the formula. 
The recently announced Rumbleverse, a pro wrestling flavored take on the genre, tickles my fancy as a long-time fan of sports entertainment. But I’m selfish, so give me more battle royales based on my specific interests. If you’ve listened to me on podcasts or watched me on streams, you probably know I’m a big Yu-Gi-Oh fan as well.

If it was up to Eyeballistic, a game development studio with multiple titles in the works, that 30th anniversary would include a remake of the original Mortal Kombat trilogy. In fact, the studio has created a “Mortal Kombat Trilogy Remake Petition” on change.org to get this theoretical ball rolling, as first reported by Nintendo Life.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Diablo has, for good reasons, become a shorthand for describing the flavour of gothic, grimdark fantasy setting in games, where pus-filled demonic hordes and rotting, undead corpses scour a hellish cathedral looking for unwitting adventurers. For all its wretched decay, however, the series still feels like an indulgence to be savoured. Its clickiness and abhorrent sights make the games endlessly gratifying, and masterful butchery of fiends eases most players into a comfortable rhythm. And part of that appeal lies in the macabre yet captivating fantasy it so deftly peddles — all that blood, gore and guts really make for a grisly setting that’s nearly impossible to look away from.


Tainted Grail: Conquest conveys the same sense of blight and doom in its dark fantasy universe — one that’s a reimagining of Arthurian legends — but also ups the ante with a huge wallop of Slay The Spire’s roguelike, deck-building elements.

First and least of these was Desert World, a blithe eternity of golden sand always viewed from kilometres up, where fizzing white rings rose toward me like expanding surf. I'd try to find my way down to the surface, but always at the risk of glitching straight through and ending up in Snake World, where monstrous serpents emerged from darkened kitchens.


Somewhere between these two poles lay the realm of the Animals, not that they were really animals, but clouds of eyelash-thin mandible, grot and sparkle, like rotten food on the point of becoming a school of tropical fish. I loved Animal World. I used to spend hours trying to mind-hack my way into it. I was pretty shocked to find its likeness in Sluggish Morss: Pattern Circus - an irresistibly strange, gristly, sorrowful, comical and inventive album of creatures, songs, places and phrases from Jack King-Spooner and composer Helena Celle.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s hard to imagine a collaboration between Zero Escape and Danganronpa creators Kotaro Uchikoshi and Kazutaka Kodaka going under the radar, but an odd release schedule (involving dropping a half-finished experience on Apple Arcade) saw interest in the collaboration buried by the time the game hit PC last month. Which is a shame, since it’s a rather unique title in their respective careers, and it charts new waters for these cult directors.


World’s End Club was the first game the pair released since forming their own studio, Too Kyo Games, and can best be described as a bizarre but intriguing blend of platforming and death games, starring a cast of prepubescent children way too young to be fixing the world or dealing with cults. Think Danganronpa, if Danganronpa was a Saturday morning cartoon rather than a murder game filled with psychopaths.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Right now Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker is so popular you can’t buy it anymore. To prevent overcrowding and crashing servers, Square Enix have had to halt free trials and new sales to keep the game stable after an unprecedented surge in popularity this summer. Between that and the global shortage of materials to add more servers, it may be quite some time until new players are able to experience it. If you have an active subscription and manage to brave the long queues however, you’re one of the lucky few who get to experience something truly special. For everyone else: hang in there, it will be worth the wait.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The latest free game giveaway in GOG's winter sale is an unexpected one for the festive season, but perhaps a game which captures the feeling of being trapped at a seemingly endless Christmas lunch with awful relatives: I Have No Mouth And I Must Scream. Nothing says 'bad family Christmas' like being tortured for 109 years by a sentient supercomputer which nuked humanity and keeps only five people alive to torment. The 90s point 'n' click adventure game is a grim one (so grim!), but one which does have its fans.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a special Christmas message from three of the NieR series' development stars, creative director Yoko Taro has announced that NieR is over. No more NieR games for us... unless he receives a massive pile of money. Quickly, it becomes clear he's just joshing around. Another classic ruse from the man in the Emil mask, and a subtle hint that they may have something new in the works. Plus, it's just a really delightful video and you should all watch it.

If you're staring baffled at an endless list of innumerable deals, you could use some help. Honestly, most of our Steam Autumn Sale recommendations still stand, but the few of us in the RPS treehouse who haven't already clocked off for the Christmas holiday do have some fresh picks for you too.

There's some Christmassy-ness flowing in to tide me over, thanks to the mini-Christmas tree in my room. Every year it's popped on the wardrobe alongside an honorary Lynx Africa. They share the same festive colours, after all.
Having pondered my tree for a bit, I thought about trees in games and how they make for good side quests. Now join me by the bark, as I examine why this might be the case in a roundabout manner.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I was younger I watched a nature documentary narrated by David Attenborough (I realise that doesn't narrow it down) and in this nature documentary David told me about a cave. It is a very big cave, and every night a huge colony of bats come screaming out of the entrance. They spend the day clinging to the ceiling of this big cave, and all their bat poo falls down and has become a towering heap carpeting the floor.
But then David said look, the carpet is moving. And it turns out that the whole bottom of the cave is covered in cockroaches and giant centipedes. And if ever a small baby bat or an old injured bat falls, it is eaten alive by this hoard of chittering insects. This nature documentary haunted me, for it was the worst thing I could imagine happening.
Anyway, Nate has been to that cave and he's going to tell us all about it for this episode of our supporters only podcast, The Nate Files. Thanks for being a supporter, pals!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been a busy, kind of mixed year for strategy games. Ever a broad church, 2021's seen enough releases to keep ten of me busy, from the easy-going Legion War to the month-consuming Shadow Empire. I don't know about you, but my personal "to play" list is out of control.
And yet, while we've had plenty to enjoy this year, it's felt like a period of build-up to something bigger. I'm not one for looking forward. If a game's not out yet it tends to disappear from my mind, making room for a hundred other recent releases in this age of plenty. That I've less interest in looking back over this year than I do pondering the next suggests that maybe we're in for something special in the coming twelve months. Or perhaps it's just been a rough one and I'm very sleep deprived and don't want to think about 2021. Either way, let's have a look at what's in store for strategy fans in 2022, yeah?

As first spotted by Bleeding Computer, multiple owners of Dell-made PCs – including the Alienware Aurora R8 and Inspiron 5680 gaming desktops, as well as the Latitude 5320 and 5520 business laptops – started developing big problems after installing the new BIOS versions. Failed boots, mainly, which of course makes it harder to apply potential fixes.

I now know the reason why and I hate to admit it. Infinite doesn’t have a battle royale mode, which I've come to realise is the perfect FPS template for gaming with my mates. Something about it just works, you know? Listen, let me explain.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know almost nothing about Alfred Hitchcock. He’s the kind of archetypal director whose work I’ve been exposed to in bits and pieces without ever actually sitting down to watch one of his films in full. All of that is to say that, upon starting Alfred Hitchcock - Vertigo the game, I was in no position to judge whether it was a faithful adaptation of the film or to recognize all but the most obvious illusions to Hitchcock’s body of work (look, birds!). That’s okay, though, because as it turns out, Vertigo is an original story based on a collage of Hitchcockian concepts, not a direct adaption of the 1958 film by the same name.
Vertigo the game follows author Ed Miller as he grapples with a debilitating case of vertigo–a condition that leaves him unable to stand as the world appears to spin around him–and paralyzing guilt over the death of his daughter and her mother, Faye, after their car falls off a bridge into a ravine below. With Ed bed ridden, it’s up to Dr. Julia Lomas, psychologist and psychiatrist, and Sheriff Nick Reyes to unravel the mystery of what really happened, and whether Faye and his daughter even exist. My thoughts on how Vertigo goes about telling this story are... complicated.

Yesterday, they announced that they've had to lay off around 25 employees to keep the studio going. They add that development will continue, albeit at an understandably slower pace.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello folks. It's been a funny old year, 2021. On the games side, it's often felt like a year of shifting goalposts. Games that were delayed by the pandemic last year finally got their due in 2021, but in turn many of the releases we were expecting this year have inevitably slipped into 2022. The pandemic has affected games of all sizes this year, and I don't think it will go down in the history books as one of our all-time greats. There were still plenty of fantastic games that came out this year, mind, and we're still counting down our absolute favourites over in our Advent Calendar. 
That said, I do think 2021 will prove to be a pivotal year for RPS - and not just because I stole Graham's key card and changed the locks on the front door of the Treehouse. It's been a year of immense change here at the site, so I wanted to take some time to reflect on everything that's happened this year, and look forward to what we've got in store for 2022.

We don't know much about it yet, but Backbone is an excellent detective puzzle game, and a gorgeous one at that, so I have high hopes for the next one.

Loads of them. Modders have been hard at work weaving nice dresses with their virtual looms at a rate of knots. Oh, and they’ve morphed characters into Buster Swords and produced some other equally useful things too. Let's have a gander at some of their most interesting creations.

Original Story: This year had us stuck in many video game time loops, but one of my absolute favourites was Loop Hero. I never thought an autobattler RPG would hook me the way it did, but I spent hours upon hours helping a little knight circle a seemingly endless void, and had a wonderful time doing it. If you didn't have a chance to play it earlier this year, it's now free on the Epic Game Store until tomorrow. I heartily encourage you to pick this one up, it's one of our favourite games of 2021.

While some traditions feel more real because they're embedded deeper in our culture, you can start your own whenever you want, and jettison any you don't care for. Anything can be imbued with special meaning and, over time, grow into a tradition you cherish and come to anticipate. So here I am, approaching Christmas, so ready for my annual play of Skeal.

That said, one of the biggest underlying causes of MIA CPU and graphics card stock has been a shortage of the chips needed to make them, and it’s a shortage that Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger has warned could likely continue into 2023.

Willing to die once again rather than betray his revolutionary allies. But it just kept going wrong for reasons that felt utterly artificial and sometimes deeply dissatisfying.
I'd have given up on the game if it weren't so interesting. For one thing, none of those deaths were final. He died as a child and came back. He died as a teenager and came back. These were not saved games, but ordinary occurrences. It's an interesting world made infuriating by awkward design choices.

How lovely to see the megacity from a new perspective, looking down on rooftops and being buzzed by hovercars. See a wee bit of my journey in a video below.

Now listen, I know it's normal to get nervous before a big trial - it's only our sense of taste on the line, after all - but trust me, I've got the best and most experienced defence team lined up for this one and - wait, what's that? They've only been in training for three months? And they're not even properly qualified? Oh no, what have we done...

Only kidding! I mean, statistically speaking I probably wouldn't get on with all of you, but I actually really appreciate that you're taking the time to read this and check out what games we'll be playing this weekend. In fact, we'll probably play loads of games over our breaks, but we'll tell you about those later. Until I see you again, have a lovely time celebrating the end of the year, however you do it.

It turns out I was miles behind the curve, as The Architect Colon Paris already exists.

It came out on PlayStation back in summer, alas they didn't give a date for PC. But, surprise! It's today! PC folks can finally try out the Baldur's Gate that console users first experienced 20 years ago. I did a full playthrough this summer and had a lovely time, at the expense of my partner, who I made sit through one of the jankiest couch co-op games in existence.

But we (I) gather ourselves and chat FPS news, like how PUBG is going free to play, Overwatch actually has something new, and lots of Halo Infinite stuff. We also get one final update on Imogen's Apex Legends rank. I'd love to say it's positive, but it's actually quite crushing. Merry Christmas.

They didn't have much to say about it at the time, but last night they announced it properly. Named Nine Sols, it's an action platformer with combat inspired by Sekiro. Honestly, they still don't have much to say about it beyond that, but they have released a gorgeous poster featuring a cat-like character that you can see in full below.

Five Nights At Freddy's: Security Breach launched last night, inviting players to fend off a whole new crew of animatronics. This is the eighth mainline game in the long-running pizzeria-based horror series (I know, there are loads of spin-offs too), and for the first time it will let players properly roam free, rather than be tied to a desk monitoring cameras.

No, Bohemia Interactive haven't announced Arma 4, but they do say they would use Enfusion for "any potential new Arma game", so maybe that's something to bear in mind while looking at its screenshots of vast landscapes. While they don't have much more than screenshots and a wee video to show right now (sorry, engine enthusiasts), they do hint that they'll release some sort of "playable demonstration of its features" at some point "soon".

Epic are also going wild with coupons again, giving a £10 (or $10) coupon on every game you buy which costs at least £13.99 (or $14.99). Given Epic's habit of paying for timed exclusives, they do have discounts on some games you'll not get elsewhere, or at least not with those vouchers.
