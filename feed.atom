This week is a very special one for Hamster Corporation, as the publisher celebrates 300 consecutive weeks of classic arcade game reissues — And to celebrate this record-breaking moment, the Arcade Archives receives a little royalty: The Arika's never-before-re-released puzzler Tetris: The Grand Master.
Launching in Japanese arcades in 1998, Tetris: The Grand Master was the biggest challenge offered to block-dropping fans to date. While TGM, (as it is known by the Tetris community), follows the typical rules and methodology of Alexey Pajitnov's world-best puzzler, this particular edition offered up a marathon 999 levels to be conquered as well as the dazzling "20G" mechanic to truly push expert players to their limits. Essentially, this difficulty option places the incom…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Is it a bird? Is it a plane? Right first time—it was a bird.
Super Kiwi 64 feels like it’s up to something. There's a tricksy energy about it that’s impossible to ignore. Players of Siactro’s earlier games might be expecting that, but this isn’t just more of the same. Super Kiwi 64 is weird in its own special way, presenting a fresh guided tour of this indie developer’s mind.
Kiwi opens in a hub area that connects eight main levels for N64-style non-linear item-collection platforming. It looks like it’s been perfectly preserved in glacial ice since the Silicon Graphics Reality Coprocessor era of the N64. It could have been released in 1999, copycatting equally Banjo-Kazooie and Donkey Kong 64. Even back then, though, we'd have been slightly wary, since the level of polish is not up with those titles. But despite that, it just feels like there is something going on – something weird.

Splatoon 3 came out back in September and we've been having a great time with it ever since. While the list of tweaks and additions in this threequel was long, and the mechanics have never been smoother, there were some out there (us included, to an extent) who felt that the series' third entry was good, but essentially more of the same goodness that we saw in Splatoon 2.
With the announcement of the game's first major update and the beginning of Chill Season 2022, all eyes and tentacles have been on the Splatlands to find out whether Nintendo could keep the game swimming forwards or whether this ink would be drying up.

So, what's there to look forward to in December? Well, apart from Inscryption, which is already out, some games to be on the lookout for include the retro throwback Super Kiwi 64 and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe's third booster wave (yes, we're counting it as its own thing). Then, later on in the month, we've got titles like Crisis Core: Final Fantasy 7 Reunion and Lil Gator Game to look forward to.

Out of the games I played this year that had some reasonable budget and were perhaps a bit more conventional, Two Point Campus stands out as a clear favorite. I had expectations going in, and while they weren’t substantially exceeded, they were certainly all met. It was one of the few games that, after writing my review of it, I wanted to delve back into. And I did, before I inevitably had to move my focus elsewhere.
I knew I was going to return to it the second DLC dropped for it, and here it is with Space Academy. I figured it was an eventuality since Two Point Hospital was fortified with extra scenarios. It’s not like Two Point Campus feels limited or barebones, but if you want more Two Point Campus, here it is: in space.

The sun is setting on Harmonix's DJ sim Fuser. The studio is shutting down live services and sales for both Fuser and its DLC on December 19.
The news arrives through a statement, confirming that neither Fuser nor its DLC tracks will be up for sale after the 19th. Those who already own Fuser will still be able to play Campaign and Quick Play, using any DLC they have already acquired as well. But online services and other options will be turned off.
"Thank you again for your support and for all the amazing mixes over the years," reads Harmonix's statement.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lNyZCKe6EM
Harmonix confirmed earlier this year that while it was ending paid DLC releases for Fuser, the team would keep on supporting the live, in-game features. While some cosmetic content drops had arrived, streams and special sessions were wound down.
Epic acquired Harmonix in 2021, saying the company would continue rolling out DLC while also working with Epic on Fortnite projects. Specifically, musical journeys and gameplay for the battle royale, which has hosted a number of big concerts throughout its lifespan.
Dance 'til you're dead
This is, frankly, a big bummer. Fuser was a genuine surprise for me, as an evolution of the Dropmix format that felt really good to toy around in. It wasn't as loudly groundbreaking as the plastic instrument revolution, but it was an enjoyable experience that led to some fun multiplayer nights with friends, making surprisingly good or beautifully cursed mixes. It wasn't for everyone, but it certainly worked for me.
As Harmonix works with Epic on whatever its next projects look like, I'm hopeful that some of the creativity seen in Fuser carries forward. For the DJs of Fuser, though, there are still a few weeks left to join together for sick mixes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Google have started issuing refunds for their recently canned game streaming service, Stadia. Those who'd bought any games, hardware or add-ons have already been told they'll get their money back by January 18th, which is when the lights go out and all access to Stadia games shuts off.
The situation sucks for the Stadia team, and the numerous developers who were caught short by Google's failure to communicate Stadia's imminent demise. If you've spent the past three years mostly buying games through Stadia though then crikey, that's a nice windfall.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's an aesthetic
Despite its technical shortcomings, the Famicom (and, by extension, the NES) was a great platform for the vertical shooter sub-genre. It might even be my favorite because, although there was never a port of Raiden for the 8-bit console, developers had to be a bit creative. Famicom shooters are more measured since bullet hell is technically not possible within the strict sprite limitations. Not that I dislike bullet hell, I just prefer a saner approach.
While my personal favorite to point to is Gun*Nac, Konami’s Japan-exclusive Crisis Force is a close second. In fact, Crisis Force even has a few advantages over my beloved Gun*Nac. I don’t think the decision-makers at Konami are even aware that Crisis Force exists, which is criminal. No top-shelf Famicom game deserves to be…]]></summary>

The Game Awards 2022 is just around the corner, and we're ready to settle down with a warm glass of Mountain Dew and put out milk and cookies for Santa Geoff as he gets ready to drop a bag of trailers down our chimneys. It may seem like slim pickings for Nintendo this year, but the Switch isn't doing too badly — and Nintendo is still the second-most-nominated publisher, behind Sony Interactive Entertainment and tied with Annapurna Interactive.
But if you're wondering how to watch The Game Awards, exactly when it is, or how long it'll run for, we've got you covered.

The Oculus Quest line of standalone virtual reality head-mounted displays has been around for three years now. As one of the only people in my friend group who has a Quest 2, I still get the same exact question every time I bring it up: "Are there any good games on there?" The answer, of course, is yes. There are plenty of great games on the Quest 2. However, there are also plenty of bad games on the Quest 2, and separating the wheat from the chaff can be a bit of a challenge.
Virtual reality is still a bit of a niche market, so it's tough to get a sense of which VR games are actually worth playing. Since so much discussion is centered on PC VR, it can be even tougher to figure out which Quest 2 games deserve your attention. I've been tooling with this thing for…]]></summary>

Another union has successfully won its vote to unionize at Activision Blizzard. Quality assurance workers at Blizzard Albany have voted 14-0 to unionize.

They revolve around people pulling out cards that suddenly give them extra power or abilities, with counterplays almost entirely dependent on whether you happen to draw the right card in response. Munchkin is the king of these, at least in terms of popularity, having sent millions of players all over the world into dungeons where they competitively slay goofy horrors. 

I cannot stand it, but it is now on Steam in early access, and statistically speaking a lot of people will be very happy about that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[That'll be a helluva lot of hearts stolen
Atlus has released a variety of sales figures concerning the many titles set within the sexy 'n' stylish Persona 5 universe — The figures are spearheaded by the recent release of Persona 5 Royal on PS5, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms, which have helped to push the brand's sales through the roof.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2ttcVKwz8I
Since its October release on the aforementioned platforms, Persona 5 Royal has shifted one million units in total. When added to the previous sales of the remixed release on PS4, Persona 5 Royal hits a high of 3.3 million copies sold. I know what you're thinking, "Can't get classier than that, Moyse". Oh no? Well, when you add all Persona 5 branded titles — Persona 5, Persona 5 Dancing in Starlight, and Persona 5 Strikers — Joker and his trendy friends have sold a grand total of 8.3 million video games.
For those keeping count, that's somewhere in the region of 16.8 million Persona titles overall, showing metaverse runners everywhere that the Shin Megami Tensei spin-off series has never been hotter. The Persona 5 franchise managed to eik several solid games off of the back of its initial 2016 launch date, (not forgetting the Nintendo 3DS release Persona Q2: New Cinema Labyrinth and Joker's appearance in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate). And, with the lofty sales of the Persona 4 Golden PC port, it seems clear that the popular JRPG franchise is set to run and run.
Persona 5 Royal is available now on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms.

Paradox Interactive has proudly announced that the grand strategy sequel Victoria 3 has sold over half a million copies since its release back in October on PC and Mac platforms.
"We want to thank all Victoria 3 players!" exclaimed Paradox Interactive in a celebratory tweet. "With 500k games sold since its release a little over a month ago, this is one of the most successful Paradox launches ever!"
https://twitter.com/PDXVictoria/status/1597636507107348480?s=20&t=s3mDK2_UKNTFHrcAjPAwGA
Launched on October 25, Victoria 3 is the latest entry in the incredibly deep world history simulation series. The new sequel follows the path forged by its celebrated predecessor Victoria 2, which was released way back in 2010, and thus it has been quite some wait for mouse-clickers everywhere. In fact, much like Half-Life 3, Victoria 3 had become something of an in-joke to the dedicated community, constantly referenced as a title that was wanted, but seemed unlikely to come into existence.
Spanning a century between 1836 and 1936, Victoria 3 offers players the opportunity to pick up the role of one of 100 countries, shaping the people, politics, and technological and economical growth of this era-defining period in human history. As you might expect, matters do not always transpire smoothly, and while the new sequel angles on the side of diplomacy, sometimes matters must be settled on the battlefield. Victoria 3 received high praise from critics and fans, including our own strategy fiend Anthony Marzano, who awarded the title a hefty 9.5 out of 10. Check out his review right here.

It's a very normal part of the gaming industry for an out-of-the-blue smash hit to define a subgenre and, in the process, inspire a number of similar games. When Golf Story arrived on Switch in 2017, taking the RPG slant of Game Boy Color's Mario Golf and pushing it in new directions, it set a particular tone for lighthearted narrative and a quirky take on its sport; inevitably, then, Soccer Story has drawn inspiration and applied similar ideas with its own spin on the beautiful game. We don't make the comparison as a criticism, and indeed developer PanicBarn makes its own jokes and acknowledgements of its reference sources. The question then becomes whether Soccer Story has enough of its own ideas, and quality of execution, to become a worthy addition to this subgenre of pixel-based comedic sporting adventures.
The answer? Yes, it does, albeit with some caveats.

It's tough to talk about Kingdom Hearts without mocking it in all the easiest ways. Yes, the basic idea of a Disney-themed JRPG developed by Square Enix is ridiculous. Yes, it's hilarious to watch Mickey Mouse look Squall Leonhart in the eye and ask him what he knows about the Door to Darkness.

That isn't about to change anytime soon, but one of the main writers behind both Portal games has revealed that they've got a "pretty awesome" idea for Portal 3. Erik Wolpaw say he and fellow Portal 2 penner Jay Pinkerton have even floated that idea around Valve, to a positive response. It's totes on the cards, is what it sounds like.  
The news comes from Wolpaw's recent interview with YouTuber DidYouKnowGaming, which is also worth a watch to learn about all the ideas Valve didn't wind up using in Portal 2. At one point it had bullet time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The former Darkness designer looks to make an Indy project
Game developer Jens Andersson, who's worked on projects like The Darkness and Chronicles of Riddick: Escape From Butcher Bay, is taking up a new role at MachineGames. Andersson is joining the team to work on its upcoming Indiana Jones game.
In a statement shared on Twitter and spotted by VGC, Andersson confirms he's joining the project as the Design Director on Indiana Jones. Andersson says that in 2009 he accepted an offer to lead design on an Indiana Jones project, but the game was cancelled before he got there.
"Now, I get a chance to do what I [originally] hoped to, but this time I get to do it with some of my oldest and best friends," said Andersson. "Joining MarchineGames is like coming home—amazing people I worked with during Riddick and Darkness, but also teeming with new ones, whose talent daily [blows] me away."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfVYgWYaHmE
Alongside Riddick and The Darkness, Andersson has also worked on Colors Live and the surprisingly fun Metroid-meets-pinball game Yoku's Island Express.
"I'm so excited about what we are building, and the way [we] get to do it—featuring one of the most iconic characters ever, in collaboration with my friends at Lucasfilm, published by one of the biggest publishers in the world, and doing it at an amazing studio like MachineGames," said Andersson. "This will be something special."
A new adventure for Indiana Jones
The new Indiana Jones project was revealed to the public in 2021, and it's been fairly quiet since. MachineGames, of Wolfenstein fame, is developing the new take on Indy. Presumably, there are top men working on it. Top. Men.
It does seem like the new Indiana Jones is a ways off though. With a new design director on board, we'll hopefully start to see more of what MachineGames is putting together.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We’re approaching the end of 2022, and we’re concluding the year by going back to our Super Replay roots by tackling an old-school survival horror game. In this case, we’re replaying one of the greatest games of the PS1 era, Silent Hill! Join us live on Twitch each Friday at 2 p.m. Central as we endure two hours of nostalgic, hair-raising scares. If you can’t catch us live, each episode will be available to watch on Saturdays on the Game Informer Shows YouTube channel. 
In 1999, Konami put the fear of fog in a generation of players with the release of Silent Hill. The eerie title eschewed the more bombastic horror of its main rival at the time, Resident Evil, in favor of more psychological frights. Protagonist Harry Mason must embark on a terrifying search for his missing daughter, Cheryl, within the eerie town of Silent Hill. What unfolds is a descent into madness that kickstarted a franchise that's (finally) returning to the limelight after years of dormancy. Join me, Marcus Stewart, along with Kyle Hilliard, as we survive Silent Hill’s debut adventure and see how its scares stack up 23 years later.
Watch on Twitch!
If you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes. You’ll also be granted entry to the official Game Informer Discord channel, where our welcoming community members, moderators, and staff gather to talk games, entertainment, food, and organize hangouts!]]></summary>

There are many games set to release in 2023 that are guaranteed to be colossal hits. Loop8: Summer of Gods isn't one of them. This relationship-building RPG from Xseed Games and SIEG Games is flying well under the radar for most gamers, but for me, it's right near the top of my most anticipated list thanks to its delectable art style and curious nature. Loop8 is a time-looping RPG that sees protagonist Nini repeating the month of August in the quiet town of Ashihara as he tries to save it from demons while building relationships with a collection of town residents. Also, Nini comes from space, so there's gonna be some sci-fi elements in there as well. This morning, Xseed Games debuted a new Loop8 trailer that shows off some of the game's English gameplay and gives players a good look at the emotion-driven AI system at play.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClrwDVHYJag
Well the framerate in those battles scenes doesn't look so good, but I did just come off playing Pokémon Violet, so it's not like that'll stop me from seeing the game through to the end.
Besides, Loop8: Summer of Gods has such a talented team behind the scenes, I have to see what kind of game you get when you bring all these minds together. If you haven't been following this game, here are just some of the names of the staff working on it:
Yoichi Miyaji, producer (Lunar series, Grandia series)
Yuri Shibamura, game designer (Touken Ranbu, Gunparade March)
En Morikura, character designer (Kizuna AI)
Shingo Adachi (Sword Art Online)
Ryudai Murayama, mascot character designer (Sakuna: Of Rice and Ruin)
Noriyuki Iwadare, composer (Ace Attorney series)
Loop8: Summer of the Gods is still without an exact western release date, but when it does reach our shores in spring 2023, it'll arrive for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.

In particular, Darktide players are miffed that the co-op action game offers bundles of its Aquila premium currency that fall just short of the cost of some items in the store, meaning you’d have to stump up for several bundles to afford those. Taking to Darktide’s Discord to ask why you can’t just buy a specific amount of Aquilas for the items you want, one player was told by a spokesperson for Fatshark that adding such a feature would be “immeasurably complex”.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pew pew times two.
Strictly Limited Games has announced that it is bringing two new shoot 'em ups - Dezatopia and Mecha Ritz: Steel Rondo - together for a combo physical release with pre-orders opening on 4th December.
The Japanese indie shooters being packaged together in such a way is perfect for all those out there who are prone to reaching the end of one game and still being hungry for more. Fortunately in this instance, 'more' is right there on the B-Side (not on the other side of the cartridge, please don't try that).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was dismissive of my first few games of Marvel Snap, intrigued by the next few, then hooked within ten. Second Dinner's lightning-fast CCG manages to pack a surprising amount of nuance and strategy within six turns, while cleverly leaning on that brevity to play around with ideas that wouldn't work elsewhere. It's neat! And free! You should try it. 
All the more so, now that the latest update has added Collector Tokens that let you buy specific cards rather than leaving you solely at the mercy of booster packs. There are also 16 new cards, nerfs to some old ones, and a smattering of other improvements.

Normally, these exclusive supporter articles are reserved for our Premium subscription tier, but because we wanted to give those Standard introductory folks a taste of what Premium has to offer as well, we decided to make a bunch of them visible to all subscribers.  
About a week into November, we realised that we didn't have a very good way of flagging which of those articles Standard subscribers could actually read (our bad), and due to a combination of holidays, illness and general busy-ness, we completely failed to come up with a solution. Apologies! To remedy that, I've now listed all of them below. Enjoy!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Where no one can hear your CPU scream
Today sees the arrival of Krafton's sci-fi horror adventure The Callisto Protocol — The super-gory trek into an abandoned space penitentiary launches today on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms, and trailers depict an atmospheric adventure that features high visual fidelity and an emphasis on atmosphere. As such, PC players may have concerns as to whether their rig can run the shiny-looking shocker.
Never fear, as developer Striking Distance Studios has released the PC specifications required in order to, (on paper at least), bring the grim gore of The Callisto Protocol splashing onto your monitors. I'll have to admit, it's a pretty beefy ask, with the Recommended settings asking for a higher-end graphics card and a pretty powerful CPU. Turn down the settings and things are a little more achievable — though you'll definitely want 16GB of RAM for Max settings regardless.
Here are the Max and Ultra PC specifications for The Callisto Protocol. Minimum specifications were not disclosed.
https://twitter.com/CallistoTheGame/status/1598391361044037633?s=20&t=v5ilF8sKoYhQg5NdJfpK4w
It should be noted that, with the embargo now clear, some reviewers are complaining of lag, stuttering, and other issues in regard to the PC release. While these are purely testimonial evidence supplied by each individual reviewer, it is a concern that has seemingly cropped up for several pre-launch players. So those planning and popping monster heads on desktop would be wise to do a little investigation before pulling the trigger on the Steam edition.
The Callisto Protocol launches today on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

We have been hotly anticipating the release of The Outbound Ghost for a good few months now. A 2.5D Paper Mario tribute with an adorable little ghosty as the main character? What's not to like! Unfortunately, it seems that the game which was released on Switch yesterday is not the version that the developer, Conradical Games, ever wanted to see the light of day.
Published in a post on the game's official Twitter account, @OutboundGhost, the developer apologised for the state that the game currently finds itself in. According to this message, the lead developer received a number of comments concerning issues with the game at launch and has now gone public, stating that " I never wanted this version of the game to come out", but the release was out of their control.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A little less forgiving than his ancestors
Ryu ga Gotoku Studio has released an action-packed trailer for its upcoming remake Like a Dragon: Ishin! spotlighting hero Sakamoto Ryoma as they embark upon a claret-spewing quest of honor and violence, set against the backdrop of 17th-century Japan. It looks to be a pretty brutal affair.
The Like a Dragon: Ishin! trailer focuses specifically on the remaster's combat mechanics, and sees our stoic protagonists engage with an army of samurai, ninja, and mercenary soldiers — utilizing several different fighting styles that all lead to the same result: a lot of blood and a lot of bodies. We see Sakamoto demonstrate four arts in all — Swordsman, Gunman, Wild Dancer, and Brawler — as he battles his way past insurmountable odds on his mission of vengeance. Sakamoto's wrath sees him lay waste to the opposition with fists, feet, cold steel, hot lead, and even a combination of all four simultaneously!
His enemies best just stay home today.
https://youtu.be/LQhLakRCEvQ
Like a Dragon: Ishin! is a long, long, long-awaited localization of the 2014 PS3 release Ryu ga Gotoku Ishin! brought up to speed with the power of Unreal Engine 4. Ishin! concerns the events of ronin Sakamoto Ryoma, an ancient ancestor of Like a Dragon protagonist Kazuma Kiryu, as they search for the killer of the father in the Bakamatsu age of Japan's Edo era. While it has been an exceptionally long wait for series fans, this remake looks set to deliver, freshly repainted and given a serious gameplay boost.
Like a Dragon: Ishin! launches on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms on February 23.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Show me ya moves!
Fun fact: if F-Zero GX—the last home console game in Nintendo’s seminal futuristic racing series—were a person, they would be old enough to vote now. Indeed, it’s been far too long since we’ve gotten a new F-Zero, which has led to copycats filling the void as best as they can. Some of these, like Fast RMX or WipEout Omega Collection, have done a great job of adding their own spin on that intense gameplay. Others, like Warp Drive, have fumbled the ball a bit. Warp Drive started as a mobile game a couple of years ago and now has made its way onto the Switch, but don’t let its origins immediately turn you off. Despite its shortcomings, there’s a genuinely enjoyable time to be had here; we only wish it could be more consistent.
Though Warp Drive is certainly a fast game, we would say that its gameplay has more in common with Mario Kart 8 Deluxe than it does with F-Zero or Fast RMX. Though you’re moving at lightspeed through gravity-defying courses, much of your success hinges on how effectively you can acquire and use items to give yourself an edge. Much like in Mario Kart, there are various points on the track where you can drive over a line of ‘warp crystals’ that will give you an item, though here the effect is not random. You can hold onto each crystal as long as you want, and each one can be used to either launch a missile, activate a short boost, drop a mine behind you, or teleport you to an alternate route on the track at specific points.

[Update: Gameloft released a new CGI trailer to help keep the engines purring for Disney Speedstorm.]
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0-7YTl6Sg8
Gameloft has announced that its cartoonish karter Disney Speedstorm will no longer meet its initially planned 2022 release date — The free-to-play racer has been pushed back to 2023, when it will launch on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms.
"We have been working diligently to craft an amazing racing experience for Disney Speedstorm, capturing our vision of the exciting magic fans enjoy in their favorite Disney and Pixar characters and games," said Gameloft in a statement posted to Twitter. "We want fans to not only be entertained, but to enjoy a fast-paced and competitive racing experience they will return to play for years to come."
"With this in mind and after careful consideration, we have decided to delay the worldwide release of Disney Speedstorm to meet our expectations and provide players with a more immersive racing experience, customization offerings, game modes, and more. Fans are invited to join us on the speedway when Disney Speedstorm launches in 2023 on PC and consoles."
First revealed in February of this year, Disney Speedstorm is a curious-looking title that will adapt The House of Mouse's huge litany of characters and worlds to the racetrack in rubber-burnin', power-slidin' action. Players will select characters and vehicles based on series such as Monsters Inc., Pirates of the Caribbean, Mulan, Beauty and the Beast, and other famous franchises before tearing up themed tracks in online and offline play. Given the enormity of the Disney catalog, Gameloft is liking hoping for a long-life title, with new karts, tracks, and racers added over the ensuing seasons.
Disney Speedstorm is currently in development for PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch.

It’s set in a slick-looking metropolis positioned by the sea called Rockay City, check. The Epic Games Store is involved somehow, got it. Oh, and let’s get Reservoir Dogs, Kill Bill and Free Willy 2: The Adventure Home actor Michael Madsen in to drop Geoff Keighley’s lost wallet off at The Game Awards HQ, yeah. He’s Geoff’s biggest fan after all. Excuse me? I don’t understand.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Up for a challenge?
Remember back in September when it seemed that every game ever was getting released all at once? One such title to land on the Switch in this period was Haiku the Robot - a post-apocalypse-set metroidvania with an adorable main character which looked like it had leaped right off of a GBA cartridge. Now the game is getting its first free content update on 16th December, and things are about to get a lot more challenging.
The update will add a whole new style of play to Haiku with the introduction of 'Corrupt Mode'. Much like Hollow Knight's Steel Soul Mode (only not as pull-your-hair-out frustrating), this new challenge will have you exploring a different side of Arcadia with only one health point to your name. You get hit, you go straight back to your last save station (see? much friendlier than Steel Soul).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Game Awards reveal incoming?
Kojima Productions director Hideo Kojima continues his mischievous efforts to tease fans with iconography from his studio's still-unannounced new title. Following on from the recent reveal of two of its main cast members, Kojima has now offered up a selection of mysterious symbols related to the project.
https://twitter.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/1598512751436890114?s=20&t=9x2KZB_zL0mBfqO8zPsKuQ
Kojima tweeted out a stark black image featuring three unique logo designs, all of which look like the type of emblems one might see on a flag or a company banner. Alongside the image, Kojima wrote a simple message "Start a new journey", once again shrouding his studio's next game with intrigue and mystery — as the Metal Gear Solid and Death Stranding creator is wont to do.
While we still do not have a title for the new game, we do know that it will star Elle Fanning of The Neon Demon and Maleficent fame, as well as Shioli Kutsuna, who eagle-eyed readers might have spotted in Marvel's R-rated movie Deadpool 2. While there is no telling exactly when Kojima will play his hand and offer up more clarity on the new game, it should be noted that The Game Awards will take place next week — an annual event which Kojima has used frequently as an opportunity to offer updates on his studio's work.
Ain't no time like the present. I'd be very surprised if we don't hear more info come December 8.

Update : We heard earlier this week that the unofficial Smash Bros. championships and upcoming tour would be cancelled with immediate effect after receiving a cease and desist notice from Nintendo.
This was expected to cost the tournament a huge amount of money in cancellation fees and seemed to be something of a U-turn for the brand which had previously operated under good terms with Nintendo's licenses.

Summoned via magical rings, these legacy heroes — 'Emblems' — will be able to be called upon in battle to bolster your strength or to use their abilities alongside your own.

Hokko Life made its debut on Nintendo's hybrid system back in September, and has now been updated with some performance fixes (such as improving FPS drops) and resolved some pesky bugs. As part of this update, the team has also "laid the ground work" for the next game update, which will apparently be coming soon.

Nearly a decade and a half ago, Visceral Games released Dead Space, a now cult-classic survival-horror game inspired by the likes of Alien and The Thing. If you've ever yearned for a return to its mix of sci-fi and horror, or if you want a near-identical experience to Schofield’s first survival horror hit, you’re in luck. Schofield's latest, The Callisto Protocol, veers incredibly close to Dead Space, for both better and worse. Unfortunately, though, it’s far too familiar. There are glimmers of g…]]></summary>

Capcom has announced Rise will be coming to the PlayStation (PS4, PS5), Xbox (Series X|S, Windows), and Game Pass on 20th January 2023.

There are a lot of reasons that might happen, but I'll be honest: it's never a great sign. I'm usually pretty chillaxed about the occasional wonky animation or frame stuttering when a game runs, but in this case The Callisto Protocol runs so badly on PC that if it were my child and the coach wasn't putting it in to play football - even as a sub in the last five minutes, you know, just to give it a go, like - I'd be saying, "Yeah, bench the sucker, I get it."
The stuttering and slowing down whenever anything moves is especially problematic in a horror game where your survival depends on quickly dodge-reacting to sudden threats. So I can't, right now, recommend you get The Callisto Protocol on PC. If Striking Distance get it running properly? Eh. Maybe.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[New update apparently "improves the performance".
Following Nintendo's apology yesterday about the tech issues and bugs in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, the new entries have now been updated to Version 1.1.0. In the official patch notes it was mentioned how "select bugs" would be fixed, and now that this update has been released, there are already early reports of some performance improvements.
The folks at GameXplain have investigated this new patch and are also claiming it's made a "huge difference" to the overall experience. In the video below, they've gone back and inspected areas where they experienced performance problems in the game and are now apparently getting a much smoother frame rate. Keep in mind, this is just one test of the new update.

Now, having been out since June on other platforms, PlayStation owners will finally be able to play the game.

The Splatoon 3 Plaza is experiencing somewhat of a trend lately, but no one really knows what it is — just that it's him.
The "him" in question is, as the lead image implies, a strange little creature with no name, often just known as "animal" or "the animal", sometimes just as "he". He appears different in everyone's interpretations — sometimes his eyes are closer together or further apart, sometimes he has more of a nose, sometimes his snout extends like an anteater's — but the one thing everyone can seemingly agree upon is that "he" is very important, in some way.

Monster Hunter Rise is officially making its way to new platforms. Rise will launch for PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Xbox One on January 20, 2023.
Initial leaks teased the info, and today, Capcom and the console manufacturers are confirming it. Monster Hunter Rise is heading to PlayStation and Xbox, and it's also launching onto Xbox Game Pass for cloud, console, and PC on January 20.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2Nbu29KUtU
Alongside the new platforms, some will also be getting some new features. The PS5 and Xbox Series X versions will get 4K and 60 FPS support, and PC will receive optimized keyboard and mouse controls. Advanced graphics settings are also coming to PC.
Across the board on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC, players will be able to turn on special screen filters. These can make the world Black and White, Sepia, Japanese or Warring Lands-style, to add a bit of a different look to the action.

More Hunters are on the way
Voice Chat is also being integrated into the PlayStation, Xbox, and PC versions of the game. And for PlayStation 5 owners, there will be some special adaptive trigger support, letting you really feel the impact of hits through the triggers.
Just base Monster Hunter Rise is arriving on January 20, while Sunbreak is expected to hit sometime in Spring 2023.
Previously, Monster Hunter Rise and its Sunbreak expansion have only been available on PC through Steam and on Nintendo Switch. Now, at least, there are some additional platforms to play on.
Sadly, those platforms aren't going to interlink. Capcom notes that while PS4 and PS5 players can match with each other for multiplayer, Monster Hunter Rise will not support cross-play or cross-save with other platforms. So if you have a seasoned hunter on Switch or Steam already, you'll need to start over on the new platforms.

The latest entry in the uber-popular series comes to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One on January 20. It will also be available on Xbox Game Pass for console, PC, and cloud at launch. The current-gen versions specifically boast 4K resolution, 60 FPS gameplay, and 3D audio, among other customizable options. However, a disclaimer on a new trailer states that 3D Audio will come to the Xbox One version in a Spring update. The PS5 port also supports DualSense haptic feedback for ranged and shielded weapons. The game is priced at $39.99 across all platforms. 


Monster Hunter Rise first launched in March 2021 for Switch before migrating to PC in January of this year. Sunbreak made its way to both platforms this past June. In addition to this news, Capcom reveals that Rise has sold over 11 million units since its launch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let's get groovy, Nintendo style
If you love live gaming music, then you're in for a treat -- Nintendo has posted a VOD of their Animal Crossing x Splatoon live concert performance from the recent Nintendo Live 2022 event to YouTube for our viewing pleasure. The event actually took place at the Tokyo Big Site in Odaiba back at the start of October, and featured tournaments for games like Nintendo Switch Sports and Super Smash Bros., as well as a stage performance from comedy duo Yoiko.
Arguably the main event, however, was the Nintendo Live concert, which of course featured the soundtracks of two of its biggest franchises to date. The show started off with a video of Animal Crossing's Isabella welcoming everyone, and introducing DJ KK -- who then appeared on a screen with some other friends from the game. How adorable! KK's set goes on for a good half hour before we get to see some friendly faces from the Splatoon games: Deep Cut.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ETszC6w-mg
This is where the show really kicks off in my opinion, because we get a whole live band including two percussionists, a keyboard player, a guitarist, and a bassist, as well as some other musicians who come out and join in the middle of the performance as well. They have amazing energy, and it looks like they're having a ton of fun!
The Squid Sisters also make an appearance to join up with Deep Cut for the finale, which makes for a pretty epic conclusion to the whole thing. The stage set up looked amazing as well with all of the lights and LED screens, and the crowd looked like they were having a blast as well as they grooved along with their light sticks.
As someone who loves both live music shows and video game music, this Nintendo Live concert is definitely one I wish I could have seen in person. At least now we can watch and rewatch it in perpetuity, right?

The dust has barely settled on the fun but rough Pokémon Scarlet & Violet. However, there have never been more questions about the future of the franchise. Because right now, we’re looking at a potential Generation 5 Remake.
The mainline Pokemon series has alternated between new entries and remakes of old games since 2013, so it’s easy to see why Pokémon Black & White could return as early as next year. In fact, Unova is specifically referenced in Scarlet & Violet, which further fans the flames of speculation. On one hand, the timing couldn’t be better. While Black & White were divisive in 2010, fans have since warmed to these titles. Many say this is the franchise’s best generation ever, including myself.

The game was able to snag three different nominations from the Game Awards, including Best Indie, Best Action, and Best Debut Indie.
Now, PlayStation has announced that they're bringing Neon White to PS4 and PS5 consoles on December 13, so a whole new group of players who have yet to check it out are going to have the chance. According to a PlayStation blog by Angel Matrix's Game Director Ben Esposito detailing the port, Neon White will run at 120hz on PlayStation 5 across the board, because "high framerate matters" when a game is so focused on speed.

The port will also "make use of PS5's adaptive triggers to make each Soul Card feel unique when you fire them as well as when you discard." Another DualSense feature you can use to your advantage is the controller's Gyroscope, which you can use to help aim with more precision. Esposito says "gyroscope aiming can take some getting used to, but it’s well worth it for an extra degree of fine-grained control when sniping demons from the start of a level."
If my Breath of the Wild playthroughs have taught me anything, it's that motion controls aren't really my thing. Either way, Neon White is a game I've been itching to play since it came out, and now that it's on my favorite console, it looks like it's finally time for me to give this heavenly speedrunner a shot.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Amnesia gets a gun
The next Amnesia from Frictional Games has been announced, and it's descending into a twisted manmade horror. Amnesia: The Bunker is a new entry in the horror series, arriving on PC and consoles in March 2023.
Frictional showed off a short clip of the new Amnesia today, spotlighting what terror may lurk in its darkest corners. Amnesia: The Bunker is set in a decrepit World War I-era bunker, where something has quite plainly gone wrong.
There are horrors that lurk out of sight, and for that, you will have a gun in Amnesia: The Bunker. The problem is, it looks like Frictional's only giving you one bullet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxLSsDmtj-U
The mechanical nature of the light and pocketwatch are already two major draws. As someone who loved the tactile feel of tools in games like the Metro series, that's right up my alley.
And a gun might have felt like a strange addition to Amnesia, which is usually more in the run-and-hide realm of horror compared to something like Resident Evil. Yet as we can see in the trailer, and in the description, that gun starts with one bullet. Genius.

A more active Amnesia
Sadly, it does seem like you can craft more weapons and tools to deal with the nightmares of the bunker. (Yes, I was hoping that you'd only have one bullet, for the whole game.)
Amnesia: The Bunker takes place in a semi-open world, according to Frictional, where you'll need to explore and test things out to find a way out. There's also a dynamic and "ever-present" monster that responds to your actions.
Overall, it feels like Frictional tackling the Alien: Isolation brand of horror, and I'm interested in that. Frictional Games has been putting together horror games for some time, and while combat isn't usually at the forefront of their games, I'm interested to see what they do with it.
Amnesia: The Bunker arrives in March 2023 for PC and consoles. You can wishlist it on Steam over here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Neon White is finally making its way to PlayStation consoles, roughly six months after the game's initial release on Switch and PC. 
Publisher Annapurna Interactive and developer Angel Matrix announced this news today, revealing that Neon White hits PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 on December 13. This fast-paced, speedrunning FPS is well worth your time if you haven't played it yet and you can find out why in Game Informer's Neon White review. 


"Neon White is a lightning fast single-player speedrunning FPS where players sacrifice their guns for godlike parkour moves," a press release reads. "Assume the role of White, an assassin handpicked from Hell, and compete with other demon slayers for a shot at redemption and a chance to live permanently in Heaven. The game utilizes a unique card-based weapon system, bite sized hand-designed levels, and a breakneck soundtrack by Machine Girl to turn players into speedrunning freaks. 
"As players unravel Heaven's mysteries, they will discover the other demon slayers are more familiar than they first appear, and through the visual novel inspired story, they learn it's never too late to seek forgiveness." 
Check out this new trailer released today for the game's upcoming PlayStation debut:

The items will drop into both respective games next week on December 6 and it's then that you'll be able to purchase these themed cosmetics from the Assassin's Creed in-game store and the Eververse store in Destiny 2. As for what to expect, the image below includes some looks: 
However, that doesn't seem to feature all of the cosmetics we can expect to see. If you don't feel like waiting until next week to see what makes its way to Assassin's Creed Valhalla, you can check out MAK Moderator's video (as spotted by Forbes) on YouTube below: 


What's interesting is that MAK Moderator's video also features some Monster Hunter-themed cosmetics, meaning there's likely a collaboration with that series set to be announced soon as well. 
"Assassin's Creed Valhalla players can purchase a Destiny 2-themed character pack, which includes armor sets, swords, a scout skin, and a mount skin," Ubisoft's announcement reads. "Players can also grab a weapons pack which includes four unique spins on Destiny's iconic subclasses, each with their own gameplay perks and custom effects. As Destiny 2 begins its next season on December 6, players will be able to visit the Eververse store to get their hands on an Assassin's Creed-themed ship, Sparrow, Ghost, and finisher cosmetics, as well as three armor ornament sets."

Sony Pictures' cinematic adaptation of Naughty Dog's adventure series Uncharted is to be further adapted into a new theme park ride: a roller coaster to be situated in Spanish park PortAventura World.
As reported by Variety, the new Uncharted coaster is described as a "multi-dimensional" dark ride, (that's an indoor coaster for all of you not adept in the art of roller coasting). Riders will be treated to a pre-show as they stand in line, before hurtling off into "unexplored territories" on a quest for unexplored treasure. The ride itself will feature 700 meters of track and will feature five launches with up to 1G of acceleration.

The December Xbox Game Pass lineup this year is closing out with some pretty notable additions. Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga is the headliner, but several other big December games are on the way too.
With Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga, the Lego series got a bit of a tune-up. It's apparently a bit more action-oriented, and yes, even allows for some sick air juggling.
If you're looking for something a little more adult-oriented, the raucous High On Life arrives on Game Pass this month too. All your guns will talk, and talk a fair bit if the trailers so far are any indication. That's on December 13.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pipe Dreams
There's been much chatter on the information superhighway since the premiere of the second trailer for Illumination's upcoming film The Super Mario Bros. Movie — While the preview offered up lots of fun & recognizable action from the Mushroom Kingdom, an alternate teaser reveals just that little bit more.
The second 30-second trailer sees our mustachioed hero as he is shown around the colorful world by fan-favorite fungi, Toad. In the brief clip, we get to see the kingdom's denizens going about their daily routine, gathering coins from Question Blocks, (which I guess is sort of an ATM in the kingdom), and traveling in style, via the Mario Bros. universe's famous network of warp pipes.
https://twitter.com/SomeKirbyFan/status/1597982078809026560?s=20&t=s6-ZVqNs4I4Wra2KtbgBJg
The original clips are being swallowed up by the mighty suits of NBC Universal, but you can check out the alternate preview in the above tweet, courtesy of Twittererer @somekirbyfan. Of course, trailers leave absolutely zero to the imagination these days, so maybe you have already had your fill of previews and wish to simply wait for the film's premiere. Good on you. Whilst I'm really not a fan of Illumination's cookie-cutter, rubber-faced shenanigans, I must admit that the world and characters look absolutely delightful in the trailers so far, and I'm definitely looking forward to seeing all of these wonderful characters brought to life. We just need to see Wendy O. and Chain Chomp and I'm good.
The Super Mario Bros. Movie is scheduled to launch in Europe on March 30, North America on April 7, and Japan on April 28, 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For the last six months, I've been slowly picking my way through Company Of Heroes 2 for the first time. I'm about halfway through its campaign at the moment, but the rhythm of calling up replacements and reinforcing my squads hasn't quite been engrained into my hotkey fingers yet. I keep making the mistake of thinking I can just push through with my remaining forces, but as any COH stalwart will know, that kind of road only ever leads to total disaster. 
Imagine my surprise, then, when I came to preview the latest build of Company Of Heroes 3's dynamic, Total War-style Italian campaign and seemed to be, you know, actually making some pretty steady progress as I pushed up its mission maps. I was, admittedly, only playing the opening levels of this particular campaign, and I also had the aid of a handy M4A1 Sherman tank providing some welcome backup muscle. But during my four hours with it, I felt more in control of the battlefield than I've ever done while playing COH2. I was making excellent use of its reinforcement options, and heck, I was even remembering to tell units to retreat back to the nearest aid post so I didn’t lose the buffs they'd earned through their new EXP-driven promotions and veterancy bonuses. Then I played a mission from its more linear North African campaign, and had a very rude awakening indeed. Why, hello, frantic pressure and torrents of death bullets from Company Of Heroes 2 again, it's been a while.

Welcome to another quiet week, in the wake of the massive phenomenon that is Pokemon. After Scarlet & Violet sold 10 million collectively in just three days, there isn't really a lot of love to spread around when it comes to the eShop.
There are a few things cycling in, though. Romancing SaGa -Minstrel Song- Remastered is out, as is the Switch port of Inscryption. It's an odd pair, but a recent indie and a blast from the past definitely had me thinking about how much genre diversity there is on the Switch eShop at this point. So many developers are porting games to it!

While "cozy" games are all the rage on the indie scene these days, perhaps one of the gold standards for relaxing, casual-grind-based gameplay is Natsume's iconic farming series, Harvest Moon — And the franchise seems to have had something of a strange effect on YouTuber Cloudie McDoom, who woke up yesterday morning to find themselves occupying a live-action recreation of the beloved franchise.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pCxPlryaI
Whilst I won't spoil the work that has gone into this short, but authentic take on Harvest Moon's hard-working world, Cloudie's video raises more than a few smiles thanks to its U.I implementation, use of flailing limbs and stop-start photography to truly capture gaming's classic "zero-turning-circle" animation style. The sounds, music, and fade-outs only complete the effect.
There are no squawking chickens, fox attacks, or trips to the market, unfortunately, but I dig the real-life recreation of Harvest Moon's "square-by-square" gardening techniques. And if you enjoyed the Harvest Moon video, be sure to check out Cloudie McDoom's channel over on YouTube for more parodies and recreations of classic video games.
The latest Harvest Moon title, Harvest Moon: One World, is available now on Nintendo Switch.

It's less common though, to fall afoul of whatever its opposite is. The uh, yellow-tinted glasses, maybe? My point is that I did you all a disservice when I described Emperor Of The Fading Suns as "an intriguing, ambitious, crap mega 4X" last year. It was a remarkable game, and more remarkably still, its developers Holistic Design Inc. recently updated it with a major patch, 25 years after its original release.

It's a lot better than I remember. And only some of that is down to the patch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With two chunky single player campaigns and a sizable multiplayer component on the way, it's no secret that Company Of Heroes 3 is Relic Entertainment's biggest COH game yet. After playing a chunky new preview build last week, it's clear there'll be lots to dive into come release day on February 23rd. But when I sat down with vice president of production David Littman to talk more about their WW2 RTS, I was curious where their focus would lie after launch. While many love Company Of Heroes for its top notch campaigns, Littman told me they "still have over 400,000 players still playing COH 1 and 2 monthly" via multiplayer, which is impressive considering the last game in the series came out nine years ago. And when it comes to COH 3, Littman says they'll go "where the players are".

Sounds excessive, but that's the kind of firepower you need when four outcasts face thousands of cultists, mutants, and demons. The follow-up to Vermintide is once again a Left 4 Dead-style cooperative first-person shooter with a fair whack of melee and, having played a lot of the beta and a little after launch, it's a joyously grubby brawl with a great cast of weirdos.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pokemon Scarlet and Pokemon Violet hit Switch just a few weeks ago on November 18 and while the game excels at a lot, it struggles on the technical side. Various glitches, bugs, and frame rate drops are present throughout a lot of the game, something we noted in our review, and fans have been vocal about their dissatisfaction with this aspect of their Paldean journeys. It seems Nintendo is taking these frustrations to heart in a rare admission in the latest update for the game. 
The company tweeted last night that a new software update of Scarlet and Violet was going live today alongside the following: "We take the feedback from players seriously, and will continue to work on improvements to the games."

        <updated>2022-12-01T14:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ryu Ga Gotoku Studios has released a new trailer for Like A Dragon: Ishin and it features a look at the various combat styles and weaponry we'll be using in the game. 
For the uninitiated, Ishin is a from-the-ground-up remake of a Yakuza spinoff released on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 3 back in 2014. However, this spinoff never made its way to the West so when Ishin hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC in February, it will be the first time a lot of players will be able to play this game. To get prepared, RGG Studios has released a brand new trailer detailing some of the combat and associated mechanics present in the game. 
Check out the Like A Dragon: Ishin combat trailer for yourself below: 


"In 1860s Kyo, a solemn samurai's fight for justice stands to change the course of Japan's history forever," a press release reads. "Draw your blade and join the revolution in this heated historical adventure." 
Players who preorder the Digital Deluxe Edition of Like A Dragon: Ishin will receive early access to the game starting February 17 (the standard release date is February 21) and the following in-game items: 
Shinsengumi Captain's Set
Room Growth Support Kit
Sword Upgrade Materials Kit
Gun Upgrade Materials Kit
Third Division Armament Expansion Kit
The Dragon of Dogma Skin
An additional three weapons: 
	
Kijinmaru Kunishige, a dark sword with a white hilt
Bloody Sheen, a sword soaked in blood
Black Ship Cannon, a cannon taken from Western Ships

For more about the game, watch the Like a Dragon: Ishin reveal trailer and then watch this five-minute trailer released back in September. Be sure to read our list of upcoming remakes, which includes Ishin, after that. 
Like A Dragon: Ishin hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on February 21, 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Capcom has announced that the second closed beta test for Street Fighter 6 will begin later this month and you can register for a chance to check the game out during it right now. 
This second beta will officially begin on December 16 and run through December 19 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC via Steam, and it will feature cross-play across all three platforms. As for what's available, Capcom lists ranked matches, casual matches, battle hub matches, open tournaments, extreme battle, the game center, and Street Fighter 6's training mode. 


If you'd like to sign up to potentially participate in this second closed beta, you can do so here. It's important to note, though, that completing Capcom's application process does not guarantee you selection for the beta. Selection is handled via a lottery system, according to Capcom, and not a first-come, first-served basis. You'll need to have a registered Capcom ID to even apply and it must be linked to your platform account so be sure to do that first thing. Other than that, good luck getting in! The response to the first closed beta for Street Fighter 6 a few weeks ago was quite positive so it sounds like this second beta is going to be a great time as well. 
In the meantime, be sure to check out Game Informer's Street Fighter 6 cover hub for all kinds of exclusive information and videos about the game. Here's a taste of what you can find there:

For now, Fatshark say they've turned off ray tracing by default for all players until they can figure out what’s going on and implement a fix.

But an exact release date is still unknown. However, in recent weeks, speculation about a release date reveal has begun to ramp up, with many predicting a FFXVI appearance at The Game Awards next month. 
Today, the official TGA Twitter account added fuel to that fire by revealing that FFXVI producer Naoki Yoshida, who we interviewed about the game earlier this summer, will be a presenter at the show this year. Plus, he's being welcomed to give "a very special live presentation." What that means remains unknown, but all signs point to something to do with FFXVI. Perhaps he'll be playing the game live, or maybe The Game Awards orchestra will do an arrangement from…]]></summary>

Understandably given the name, there were not games for the developers kit outside of a few incredibly basic demos. But there was Half-Life 2, for which Valve had implemented a hacky VR mode that you could activate with some console tomfoolery.

In my review, I praised many elements of Sonic Team's first "open-zone" attempt, but my main takeaway was, "I can’t wait to see how Sonic Team iterates on this formula in future entries." While those future entries are likely years away, the developer today gave us a glimpse into how it plans to expand Sonic Frontiers throughout 2023 through a content roadmap.
The Sonic Frontiers 2023 content shows off a series of future content updates to the game. The three updates will roll out to players of Sonic Frontiers over the course of 2023 at no additional cost. While no timeline is given, it's probably safe to assume that Update 2 will hit so…]]></summary>

There are actually two links to Mirage, because this final chapter features *more* of its protagonist, Basim, who Valhalla persevere-ers will have already met. I bailed after 15 hours and so have very little idea what's going on, which is a shame because I'd love a chinwag with Shohreh Aghdashloo.

Even the time capsule that's Classic WoW probably couldn't capture the same buzz of the past, mainly because I, as a being of flesh and bone, am not a teenager anymore. But I'd argue there's one place that still captures the essence of WoW more than WoW itself nowadays: YouTube. Or to be more specific, channels which provide hour-long music and ambience from some of the game's most memorable zones.

Among the changes with this update are six new galaxy shapes to mix up the pattern of your interstellar empires a bit. Orion also rebalances fleet combat, bringing in elements of the open beta that began back in October. Paradox have chucked in a few reworks of bits and pieces from Stellaris’ numerous expansions too, including changes to the Utopia DLC’s Ascension path. You can see more about that by watching the video below.

        <updated>2022-11-30T15:13:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Narrative dinosaur adventure Goodbye Volcano High has awakened from dormancy with a new gameplay trailer and a 2023 release window. The title, unveiled in June 2020 as one of the first PlayStation 5 titles, will now arrive sometime next summer.
Goodbye Volcano High is a choice-driven teenage coming-of-age story starring Fang, a high school student, aspiring musician, and if you didn’t notice, a pterosaur. Alongside their bandmate Trish and other friends, the dino teens are faced with making the most of their final days together. Developer KO-OP describes the narrative as a tale of “personal growth, acceptance, and the power of community.” A new teaser trailer provides the first look at gameplay, showing off the dialogue interface and rhythm mechanics. 


KO-OP initially planned to release Goodbye Volcano High in 2021. However, last August, the small team pushed the launch into 2022 due to COVID-related development challenges and the decision to reboot the game’s narrative. The game still didn’t make a peep throughout 2022, and KO-OP says this latest delay stems from continued challenges related to the pandemic and the game’s large scope relative to the team’s size. For example, KO-OP states that over 6,000 voice lines have been recorded on top of completing a significant amount of “bespoke” animations. 
Goodbye Volcano High is slated to launch on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and PC via Steam.]]></summary>

It wasn't the most overwhelming victory of this scientific process so far, but it certainly was the loudest. More dakka indeed. This week, I ask you to pick between a cool form of human movement and some cool human speech. What's better: mantling or cool swearing?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For the last ten years, the XCOM designers at Firaxis have traded in 'if's and 'maybe's. If this shot lands, then maybe I can pull off this carefully calculated plan I’m brewing. It's exactly the kind of taut, knife-edge tension we've come to love and expect from their turn-based strategy games, but Marvel's Midnight Suns takes a different approach. As the titular demon hunters join forces with some famous Avengers faces to take down the evil sorceress Lilith and Marvel mega villain Chthon, there's never any question about whether your moves will or won't work here. You're playing as the world's most powerful superheroes. Of course, they’re going to work. And forget about cowering behind knee-high cover walls, too, because if you're not already bulletproof, you've certainly got the reflexes and supercharged muscle mass to soak up anything Lilith’s Hydra minions are going to chuck at you.

Question is, by tipping the power scales in your favour like this, do you risk destroying that delicate balance of risk and reward? At first glance, it's easy to think a more reliable set of heroes would end up dulling what made Firaxis' XCOM games so special, but the result is something equally thrilling. Given how the Marvel machine has drawn in and chewed up so much singular creative talent in the wider MCUniverse, Firaxis emerging with their cred intact is nothing short of extraordinary. Not only have they endured their radioactive spider bite, they've come out bigger and better for it, creating not only the best Marvel game I've played, but one of the best superhero games full stop.

Its TLC NAND and DRAM cache also mean that performance remains high even in sustained write scenarios, unlike cheaper QLC/no-DRAM drives. 
The Crucial P5 Plus normally costs £100+, but today it's down to £92.51 on Amazon UK - one of the best prices we've seen for this model although not quite the best ever.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo and animation studio Illumination shared the latest trailer for The Super Mario Bros. Movie today. Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto was on hand to introduce the new trailer; Anya Taylor-Joy (who is playing Princess Peach) and Seth Rogan (who voices Donkey Kong) also shared selfie videos of themselves sharing their contractually obligated excitement about participating in the film.
The trailer showed more of the Mushroom Kingdom and primarily focused on Donkey Kong and Princess Peach. We also heard more from Chris Pratt's Mario, Charlie Day's Luigi, and Jack Black's Bowser (who explicitly refers to Mario as being a human). The trailer shows Mario training, fighting Donkey Kong, driving a kart on a rainbow road, traveling with Peach, and there was also one quick moment where we saw the human world.
The Super Mario Bros. Movie arrives in theaters on April 7, 2023. You can see our live reaction to the trailer below.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Before the release of Gotham Knights, Warner Bros. Games Montreal revealed that following the game's launch, four-player co-op, a heavily requested feature by fans, would be added in the form of a new mode called Heroic Assault. That mode, as well as a new two-player mode called Showdown, are both live now in Gotham Knights thanks to a new update. 
The base campaign of Gotham Knights allows for two-player co-op play, but getting all four of the knights together wasn't possible. That's still the case while playing through the game's story, but the new online cooperative Heroic Assault mode, which tasks players with defeating enemies and completing challenges across 30 floors, supports four-player play.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Somewhere in the region of 8,000 games have been removed from Steam since its inception, from the mass banning of “fake games”, to publishers removing their own titles due to licensing disputes, pending re-releases, personal disillusionment, server shutdowns and political scandals. Valve even took down one of its own games. Released in 2004 with Steam AppID 92, Codename: Gordon is a Flash-based 2D side-scroller set in the Half-Life universe, developed by Nuclearvision and published by Valve. It was removed due to a hard-coded link to the now-defunct developer’s domain, which Valve regarded as a security risk.
But removed isn’t always the same as gone, and exploring Steam’s deleted items is an adventure through modern gaming history. I spoke to some developers of delisted games to find out more.

Having played all three previous seasons of Telltale's choose-your-own-zombie-apocalypse tearjerker (plus the 400 Days DLC and the Michonne spin-off), it's no surprise that I was incredibly invested in Clementine's story by The Final Season. I'm not a big kid person, typically, but you'd have to be beyond heartless not to love little Clem, wouldn't you? Even though, by the time TFS rolls around, she's grown into medium-sized Clem, and is a bit bloody scary to boot.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Card-based strategy games seem to have really found their feet over the last 12 months. Now that we're a few years clear of Slay The Spire's chokehold over the genre, deckbuilders are starting to come thick and fast in a variety of exciting mash-ups. This year alone, I've sunk a hefty number of hours into the deckbuilding tower defence 'em up ORX, got lost in the tabletop plots of Foretales, and later this week we'll see the launch of Marvel's Midnight Suns, the new card-based strategy RPG from XCOM makers Firaxis. It's a good time to be a fan of deckbuilders, is what I'm saying, and early next year the mythological exploits of Mahokenshi will be looking to carry the baton forward into 2023. 
Made by the Paris-based Game Source Studio, this turn-based strategy battler sees you take control of four types of samurai as you seek to bring balance to a mystical realm above the clouds. Oni, goblins and other creatures from Japanese myth are your primary antagonists here, but its hexagonal islands are also stuffed full of text-based narrative events, sidequests, and treasure troves to uncover. It's a lot to take in, but the latter in particular are vital to your success. That's because every time you start a new mission in Mahokenshi, you'll be going in with a completely fresh deck - and based on an early preview build I've been playing recently, it's both an ingenious way to keep things feeling fresh, but it can also be a double-edged sword when it comes to trying out new tactics.

Blizzard have streamlined the early game, sure, but in doing so they've made it almost impossible to pin down my sense of place in the world. As Blizzard carves out new space for new regions and races with each and every expansion, I wonder: has the game become too big? Or put another way: am I unable to grasp just how vast its become?

This news comes by way of a quarterly financial call held yesterday by the company in which CDPR briefly touched on this remake being handled by developer Fool's Theory, as reported by VG247.  While not much was revealed, CDPR did reveal in the slide pictured below that Codename: Canis Majoris, which we now know to be The Witcher Remake, will be a "story-driven, single player open-world RPG" and a "modern reimagining of 2007's The Witcher."
This might come as a surprise because that 2007 game wasn't open-world and instead took players through small hub-like levels in the city of Vizima. 
Unfortunatley, this slide is essentially all that was revealed in regards to The Witcher Remake. It might be a while before we learn more about this remake, too, considering that CDPR told fans to "please be patient" because "it's gonna be a while until we can share more details" when the company announced this game last month. 
The Witcher Remake is just one of multiple projects in the works at CDPR. Last month, the company revealed it was developing a brand new Cyberpunk game, multiple new Witcher games (including this remake), and even a new IP under the codename "Hadar."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Starship Troopers, Paul Verhoeven’s deliberately scene-chewing take on Robert Heinlein’s dubious classic of military sci-fi, has been adapted for PC a fair bit. Games based on the interstellar action of the movie tend to end up veering towards the strategy genre though, such as the recent Terran Command. Well, Offworld Industries have loaded up a dropship with Starship Troopers: Extermination and plonked the licence right where it belongs on Planet Co-op FPS. It’s targeting a 2023 release, and probably the head carapace of a very confused giant alien insectoid, too. You can watch a short teaser for the game below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft might consider offering Sony a 10-year licensing deal for Call Of Duty to persuade European Union regulators to approve their Activision Blizzard acquisition. Reuters report that sources familiar with the deal claim an offer could come ahead of the European Commission’s January deadline for their statement of objection, a formal list of the body’s concerns about how the $68.7 billion (£57 billion) buyout deal might affect competition within the games industry. If Microsoft show willingness to offer concessions and ease the EU regulator’s competition concerns, that could potentially speed up the regulator’s decision-making process.

I'm telling you all this because it might pique your interest in their upcoming sandbox RPG, which we now know will be out at some point next year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gaming monitors are great, but if we're being realistic, they can very easily become one of the priciest building blocks in your entire PC gaming setup. If you are currently screen shopping, then, your best course of action is probably to take advantage of the current Cyber Monday gaming monitor deals.
My curated picks are all below, and as always, I’m only recommending sufficiently good hardware that’s available on a meaningful discount. A couple of our best gaming monitor members are even in here, though it’s a broad church overall, with 1080p, 1440p, and 4K screens making the cut alongside the occasional ultrawide model. We’re looking for gaming credentials specifically, too, so heightened refresh rates and support for variable sync tech (like FreeSync and G-Sync) are important.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After more than six years of making games together, indie development team Sokpop Collective are just about to reach their 100th release in December. Hitting that milestone means the group have decided to change how they operate and adjust their Patreon. They’ll no longer be working to release one game per month. Sokpop are recommitting to releasing another 100 games though, so they’ll still be surprising us with intriguing diversions like village-building card game Stacklands or cutesy RTS King Pins. You can watch a trailer for their recently released 99th game, action RPG Springblades, below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Unlike with most flavours of PC hardware, the list of good Cyber Monday gaming laptop deals is noticeably smaller than the catalogue of quality, discounted notebooks that Black Friday brought. That’s partly stock running out, and partly retailers just being less willing to extend these sales over the weekend. Killjoys. Still, we’re not out of luck yet, nor out of laptops – as you’ll see below, there’s still a variety of deals to choose from, especially in the UK.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Classic RPG Heroes of Might and Magic III has been transmuted into a board game, with its Kickstarter campaign currently on over 2.6 million pounds. That's 6000% over its £43,000 funding goal. You people want this. Are you sure you want this?
The board game is a hybrid of competitive deckbuilding and exploration, where 1-4 players travel around an overworld collecting cards to play in separate combat encounters. I do dig deckbuilding, but I suspect this might lack a little magic to anyone who isn't after a nostalgia kick.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mirrorshades cannot be the iconic eyewear of modern-day cyberpunk, I learned during a Microsoft Teams meeting. For decades, cyberpunks, hackers, and internauts have donned a cool pair of shiny shades to strike a cool pose. But mirrorshades are a serious security hazard in this age of video calls: other people can see your screen and desk reflected in the lenses. If you're mirrored up, people can gain access to private data or see if you are, for example, playing Windows Solitaire instead of paying attention to the meeting. So what's a 21st-century cyberpunk to wear? It's not like you can go without cool glasses (or stop playing Solitaire during meetings). I have ideas.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Synced (formerly Synced: Off Planet) is heading into open beta on December 10th, and has quite a few hyphenated terms applied to it. This sci-fi game is both squad-based and match-based, a roguelite hero-shooter, and Tencent's publishing division Level Infinite even go as far as describing it as a rogue-looter, of all things. Whatever you want to call it, though, the main thrust of the game is about finding and taming machine creatures known as Nanos in a techno-apocalypse, mostly so you can battle more Nanos inside a special sealed zone called The Meridian. Come and see what to expect when the beta begins in an exclusive gameplay trailer below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For what has felt like my entire life (but was probably only the months of October and November) every ad I was served on YouTube was for a sale on Her Interactive's Nancy Drew games. I remember it not only because the content is burned into my brain, but because they themed it around getting involved in cosplay, and got a bunch of cosplayers - and no disprespect to them, because they did a great job - to dress as characters from the games. And I kept thinking, like... what? Apart from Ms Drew, what characters are worth cosplaying from a series of licensed Nancy Drew puzzle games?
Anyway it clearly didn't matter, because I saw the ads so often that I went and bought the most recent one out of curiosity. You win, Her Interactive! Midnight In Salem is a spooky mystery wherein Nancy Drew must solve an arson case (with the Hardy Boys in tow, no less) that has possible occult tie ins. It came out in 2019, and is Nancy Drew #33. 33 Nancy Drew games! Imagine. Also, I cannot download it and I have spent over two weeks trying.

The deal price is £456.70, versus a normal price of £600, and is for stock from Amazon US - but that includes shipping, import duty and all other potential fees. There's even the possibility that fees are less than expected, as several US items I've ordered from Amazons overseas have come with small discounts.

The wired Pulsefire Haste (£20, normally £50) is the cheaper and lighter option, weighing in at 59 grams, while the wireless Pulsefire Haste Wireless (£40, normally £90) offers more freedom but requires recharging every 100 hours. It also weighs a tiny bit more, at 61 grams.

Although the remake of Ishin was announced during Sony’s September State Of Play stream, Kenzan seems quite far from being picked up for a revamp.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sega released Sonic Frontiers earlier this month and while fans have been finding plenty of fun in this new open world-ish take on the blue blur, they've also been running into some bugs. Fortunately, Sega is releasing a new Sonic Frontiers patch on all platforms to address some of these bugs and bring additional optimization to the game. 
This news comes by way of a new tweet from the official Japanese Sonic the Hedgehog Twitter account that reveals update 1.10 "fixes an issue where the boss would sometimes disappear when retrying the boss battle on Chronos Island," as reported by Video Games Chronicle. This update is already live on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 and is expected to begin rolling out to other platforms very soon. 


Other fixes in the 1.10 patch include fixing the Chaos Island map to display properly after clearing the island, fixing crashing bugs and audio issues, adding UI improvements, optimizing stability and performance, and more, according to Update Crazy, as noted by VGC. 
While waiting for the patch to download, read Game Informer's Sonic Frontiers review and then check out our top 10 tips to help you build momentum in the game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Matthias Linda is feeling tense. Chained Echoes, the retro Japanese-inspired RPG he's been working on as a solo dev for the last seven years, is almost ready to release on Steam, but he tells me there's "still so many little and not so little things to do" before the big day hits on December 8th. "[I] still need to patch the languages into the console versions. Still need to pass one submission," he says over email. "I can’t really think about the release itself, just about the things I need to finish till then."
But he also says he's "happy at the same time". After a successful Kickstarter campaign in 2019, Chained Echoes has been gradually gathering steam ever since - and judging by the 90-minute demo I was able to play recently, it's clear Linda's got something really quite special here. Not only do its 16-bit-style visuals look absolutely stunning, but its turn-based combat's also unlike anything else I've seen. You've still got your classic list of commands to pick from, but as battles progress you'll need to maintain a kind of flow state known as Overdrive to deal the optimum amount of damage. Overextend your party's abilities and you'll leave yourself vulnerable to critical hits from your enemies, but go too slow and you'll need to build your Overdrive bar back up to regain those lost stat buffs. It's a fascinating system, and was borne out of Linda's desire to "build a bridge between the worlds" of considered, turn-based tactical combat and the fast-paced action of real-time.

        <updated>2022-11-28T13:11:11.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Warner Bros. Discovery revealed last month that it had hired Peter Safran and Marvel Studios alum and director James Gunn (Guardians of the Galaxy, The Suicide Squad, Peacemaker) to lead as co-CEOs of DC Studios, as reported by Variety. Since then, Gunn has been fielding questions about DC Studios, the DCU's future, and what his plans are as a new lead within DC's entertainment output. 
When asked on Twitter yesterday if he and Safran are "planning to give more DC characters TV shows that'll add to the story for the DCEU," Gunn responded, "Yes, most definitely, the DCU will be connected across film and TV (and animation)." In a follow-up tweet, another user asked is there are plans to connect games to this larger DCU canon as well, to which Gunn simply responded, "Yes." 
Yes.
November 27, 2022
It's an interesting response and idea, especially given that it seems clear Warner Bros. Discovery wants its DCU to become something more akin to Marvel Studios' MCU. However, MCU plans don't include video games because Marvel's video game efforts through partners such as Insomniac Games (Marvel's Spider-Man), Crystal Dynamics (Marvel's Avengers), and others do not connect in any way.
In fact, Marvel Games vice president and creative director Bill Roseman said back in September that it's important that each studios' Marvel game is not connected to the rest as it allows for narrative freedom said studio might not get otherwise.
This is one area DC could differ greatly from Marvel and who knows, perhaps it's the creative edge DC needs to catch up to the MCU. Only time will tell. 
In the meantime, check out our thoughts on the latest DC game in Game Informer's Gotham Knights review. Read our list of the top 10 superhero games of all time after that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Grim co-op action game Warhammer 40,000: Darktide is out on PC on Wednesday, and devs Fatshark have taken a load off players’ minds by confirming that progression from the pre-order beta will carry over. Although Fatshark had mentioned in previous Steam updates about the game’s beta that player progression might not be fully guaranteed, they tweeted over the weekend to let players know that progression will be maintained once the game’s released.

New features since beta1 include: Variable interface scaling at whatever size you want (not just 2x and 4x), with optional chunky bevels for that retro feel. Multi-track level crossings to keep road vehicles from stopping in the middle of the crossing. A new Generate World menu which now includes NewGRF, AI, and Game Script configuration menus. Cargo filters for vehicle lists (such as at stations) to allow better visualization of traffic. Optional cargo names above vehicles in vehicle lists, to show at a glance what they carry. The ability to clone or share orders with vehicles grouped by shared orders. An improved local authority action window which now shows you actions you can’t afford, instead of hiding them. In addition, some new tools are available to AI and Game Script authors: Scriptable league tables which can replace the default scoring system AI and Game Scripts can now be modified in Scenario Editor for existing scenarios (although not savegames) (As ever, see the changelog for further details).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been excited about developer Flying Wild Hog’s Evil West since its reveal at The Game Awards in 2020. So much about it immediately captured my attention. Despite Red Dead Redemption’s best efforts, I’ve always felt there’s a shortage of wild wests in video games, although some games use a western’s formula to tell a story set elsewhere. Evil West’s premise also feels reminiscent of something you’d see in the PlayStation 2 era: cowboys who protect mere mortals from the secret horrors of the world, such as vampires and other creatures. My mind can’t help but see Darkwatch, a game I played repeatedly as a child, when I see Evil West.

I am talking about Ratatoskr, the eyepatch-wearing squirrel who watches over Yggdrasil, the world tree that holds the realms in place.
Ratatoskr technically appeared in God of War (2018), but he was less of a character and more of an ability. Atreus could summon the translucent blue squirrel to bring health items and sometimes hacksilver. In God of War Ragnarök, Ratatoskr is a physical, non-translucent c…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As of writing, the fastest runthrough of Neon White’s “Smackdown” level is 9.56 seconds, earned by player “earlobe” on September 6, 2022.
Standing in contrast is the work that went into it. According to designer and creative director Ben Esposito, the earliest iteration was in March 2019, more than three years before its release in June 2022. In that time, there were more than 50 different iterations. Sometimes changes were small. Other times they fundamentally altered the level. Every designer who worked on the game has touched Smackdown in some form. Nevertheless, load into it now; chances are all that labor is invisible to you. Before sitting down to write, I beat it in just 11 seconds.
Neon White is a game built around speedrunning. Levels are short. If you’re playing as intended, you hardly notice your surroundings before moving on. But the only way that works effectively is if levels are meticulously designed to facilitate that movement; they have to be made so that it feels natural for the player to fly through them. Making a level you barely think twice about takes a lot of effort. Read more...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Despite an avalanche of entries since its original release in 1991, many still consider Sonic the Hedgehog 2 the pinnacle of the series. Sonic the Hedgehog 2 was showered with praise upon release in 1992 and surprisingly, that sterling reputation hasn't faded decades later. We asked the people behind the game's success to share how Sonic's second outing became one of Sega's driving forces in its fight against Nintendo.
Coming off of the massive success of the Japan-developed Sonic the Hedgehog, Sega relocated development efforts for the sequel to the newly founded Sega Technical Institute in the U.S. Sega tapped Mark Cerny to lead the STI, who has since gone on to help create other mascots like Crash Bandicoot and Spyro the Dragon. Key members of the original development team, such as seri…]]></summary>

Instantly, I’m overcome by the scent of greenery – lush and humid, with a hint of maybe mint. Jungle surrounds this strip of paved runway in every direction. And I’m here, of all things, to see a video game.
But first, I must explore a place on the other side of the world I hadn’t even heard of a month earlier – a narrow island called Lifou, part of a French territory known as New Caledonia, which sits some 750 miles east of Australia. I’m meeting a small team of game developers who have chosen to find inspiration for their new game in this remote locale. The team is toying with a big idea: Craft a game that’s rewarding in its own right but simultaneously introduces players of the world to a place most of them have never seen.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pokémon Scarlet and Violet sold more than 10 million combined units over its launch weekend, claiming the top spot for most three-day launch weekend software sales in Nintendo's history. The number, which includes physical and downloadable copies as reported by Nintendo, already places Pokémon Scarlet and Violet in the top 15 best-selling Nintendo Switch titles of all time. In this three-day number, Pokémon Scarlet and Violet have already outpaced lifetime sales of games such as Splatoon 3, Kirby and the Forgotten Land, Nintendo Switch Sports, and Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury.
The current overall best-selling Nintendo Switch title is Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, which has sold just over 48 million units as of the end of September. As of this writing, the Pokémon franchise occupies 3 of the top 10 slots of lifetime Nintendo Switch software sales, with Let's Go, Pikachu and Eevee at number 10, Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl at number 8, and Sword and Shield at number 5. Pokémon Scarlet and Violet need to sell just under 5 million more combined copies to crack into the top 10. To date, the Nintendo Switch has sold over 114 million units.
Pokémon Scarlet and Violet represent the first time players are able to explore a fully open-world environment in a mainline Pokémon RPG. While critics praised various aspects of the newest games in the series, the technical performance has been universally panned. However, despite those concerns, Game Freak, The Pokémon Company, and Nintendo clearly have another massive hit on their hands.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fighting aliens in video games have been an important part of the medium since its inception. The very first video game, Space War, was about a war in space. Space Invaders was an early cultural phenomenon that was rumored to have inhaled so many coins that it created supply issues for the currency in Japan. Halo, one of the biggest video game franchises ever created, is about an ongoing war with aliens. We enjoy fighting aliens in video games because it’s easy to make creatures from another planet the enemy and they can look like anything.
The smaller, more personal alien invasion story, however, is a specific sub-genre of extra-terrestrial narrative we don’t often see in video games. When we fight aliens, it’s usually a power trip meant to offer a playground of action possibilities, but …]]></summary>

        <updated>2022-11-23T16:34:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new Fire Emblem Engage trailer has detailed how players can summon "Emblems," characters from past Fire Emblem games. Units will be able to equip Engage Rings to gain the ability to gain the power of a hero, like Marth or Byleth. When units equip the rings, they become synced with the Emblems, boosting their stats and giving them access to new, Emblem-specific skills. Based on the demonstration in the trailer, this will make a massive difference in a unit’s power level.


Units can also “Engage” with the Emblems, fusing into a new form even more powerful than a synced form. In addition to gaining access to special weapons, the player can use Engage Skills: unique abilities that harken back to the Emblems’ original games. For example, since Byleth was a teacher in Fire Emblem: Three Houses, one of his abilities allows him to teach nearby units, boosting their stats. Meanwhile, Corrin can use an ability called Dragon Vein, which alters the terrain in the same way she was able to in Fire Emblem Fates.
In total, the trailer showed off six Emblems: Marth (Fire Emblem: Shadow Dragon), Sigurd (Fire Emblem: Genealogy of the Holy War), Celica (Fire Emblem Gaiden/Fire Emblem Echoes: Shadows of Valentia), Lyn (Fire Emblem: The Blazing Blade), Corrin (Fire Emblem Fates), and Byleth (Fire Emblem: Three Houses). Additionally, a trailer from last week features glimpses of Ike and Lucina, and then mentions 12 rings, implying that Engage will feature more Emblems at launch.
Fire Emblem Engage was announced at a Nintendo Direct back in September. The initial trailer revealed that Alear, the game’s protagonist, is the Divine Dragon, a descendant of a royal family of Dragons that defeated the Fell Dragon many years ago. We’ll know the full story and more when the game launches on January 20, 2023.]]></summary>
