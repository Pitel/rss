        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's not just studios being hoovered up
Former PlayStation executive Shawn Layden has announced that he has joined Chinese conglomerate Tencent in a new "Strategic Advisor" role. Layden announced his new gig on industry site LinkedIn.
According to Layden, his new role will see him "advise, assist, and support the team at Tencent as they deepen their activities and commitments within the industry to which I’ve devoted the majority of my career."
"We are at an epoch-defining moment in gaming and interactive entertainment," continued Layden. There are many possible roads ahead but only a few are profound, broadening, inclusive, edifying, inspiring, and/or sustainable. I am thrilled to continue this journey of discovery and thank Tencent for the opportunity."
Layden has held several high-ranking roles in PlayStation, including President and CEO of the industry giant's U.S. operations. His final role with the company was as the chairman of PlayStation Worldwide Studios, a position Layden left in 2019, citing concerns about burnout in an interview with Bloomberg.
Tencent has been in gaming's headlines with incredible frequency, having made an aggressive push to expand both its portfolio of developers and publishers, while also pushing its operations further into western territories, no doubt Layden's global experience will help Tencent in its endeavors.
Recent years have seen the holding company pick up outlets such as Activision, Supercell, Epic Games, Remedy, Riot Games, PlatinumGames, Bohemia Interactive, Dontnod Entertainment, Klei Entertainment, Inflexion, Sumo Digital, and Funcom. Most recently, Tencent teamed with Sony to purchase a 30% stake in FromSoftware owners Kadokawa Group, and has also entered into a partnership with Ubisoft founders Guillemot Family.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here's what happened
So roughly a week ago, Radiant Silvergun arrived on the Switch following a Nintendo Direct announcement. That's good! But then it was quickly removed from sale. That's bad! As of today though, that crisis has been averted, and Radiant Silvergun is now live on Switch.
So what went down with Radiant Silvergun on Switch? Thankfully, we have a full report from the publisher, Live Wire
The same day Radiant Silvergun went live on Switch, it was taken down. A lot of folks speculated that it was ratings-related, which was confirmed by the publisher several days later on Twitter: "The reason it was removed from the store is because the product's rating has changed. We have created new data and have already submitted it to them." The team also took the opportunity to begin to address some of the bugs that were present in the briefly-released port.
So after all that, the game is back up. The browser listing may not be live depending on your region, but the game is currently live on the actual Switch eShop.
It's a good thing this was resolved, because Radiant Silvergun is an all-time classic shmup (shoot 'em up), and it deserves to be on as many platforms as possible. Thankfully the eShop issue was minor, and the team has acknowledged this version's bugs and is working on a fix.

Whether you're talking about the two well-received films, the fun Sonic Boom animated series, or the long-running and beloved comic series, people who enjoy the Sonic the Hedgehog video games have had plenty of other avenues to expand their fandom. The next project to land on that list is Sonic Prime, the upcoming Netflix series that gives us all-new adventures with Sonic and his friends/enemies.
Today, Netflix and Sega released a teaser trailer giving us a taste of the action. It doesn't show much, but if the 40 seconds of action are any indication, it's bringing plenty of style and fun (as well as several classic characters). You can check out the trailer in the header above.
Sonic Prime is set to release exclusively on Netflix this winter. For more on what else Sonic is getting up to this winter, check out our exclusive coverage hub of Sonic Frontiers here. For our thoughts on the latest Sonic video game release, Sonic Origins, head here.]]></summary>

Last week was a biggie for Yakuza fans, as Sega and RGG Studio bombarded the community with exciting news pertaining to not only new titles in the dramatic RPG series, but also revealed some long-awaited news on the lost-in-translation side series, Yakuza: Ishin!.. erm... Like a Dragon: Ishin!
You see, as part of this cavalcade of series news, Sega also announced that it is officially adopting the "Like a Dragon" branding (a closer approximation of their original Japanese title: Ryu ga Gotoku), for all Like a Dragon/Yakuza releases going forward. No more titles set within the Yakuza universe will be afforded the "Yakuza" name in any of their English localizations.

One of the biggest surprises and standouts during the 13th September Nintendo Direct was the reveal of Master Detective Archives: RAIN CODE, a brand new mystery game from Kazutaka Kodaka, the creator of the Danganronpa series.
Set in a rainy city full of bright lights, and embracing a more dark fantasy style compared to the pink blood-splattered school halls of Kodaka's previous series, RAIN CODE marks Kodaka's first foray into full 3D and reunites him with Spike Chunsoft and many of the team behind the beloved, over-the-top mystery games.

How long will Sonic Frontiers take to beat? Well, it could be anywhere from 20 to 60 hours, based on a new statement from Sega (and depending on how much you actually engage with the game itself).
Speaking to IGN, it seems like Sega has provided a concrete answer on how long the game will actually take to complete. Here's the full rundown, provided by Sonic Frontiers director Morio Kishimoto: "it should take the average player between 20 and 30 hours to finish the game, while completionists can easily spend double the time to see everything."

Both GPUs are based on Nvidia’s new Ada Lovelace architecture, and will launch this year: the RTX 4090 on October 12th, and the RTX 4080 sometime in November. 


Key features of Ada Lovelace, and thus these new cards, include 3rd Gen RT cores, 4th Gen Tensor cores, and a new streaming multiprocessor. These supposedly add up to twice the performance of Ampere (that’s the RTX 30 series architecture currently dominating our best graphics card guide) in standard rasterised games, and up to four times the performance in ray traced games. And since Nvidia were clearly in a ray-tracey mood, they also took the opportunity to reveal Portal RTX: a semi-official mod for the original Portal that upgrades it with RT lighting and reflection effects. Corrrr.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hearts of iron
Electronic Arts has revealed a new Marvel project. Today, the publisher confirms that EA Motive is working on an Iron Man video game.
The seemingly untitled-for-now project will be a single-player, third-person action-adventure game starring Iron Man, Marvel's suit-clad hero. EA Motive, the team behind this new project, has previously worked on Star Wars: Squadrons, and is heading up the new Dead Space remake releasing in January.
According to the EA announcement, this game will feature an "original narrative" that taps into the history of Iron Man. It will also tap into Tony Stark. EA says it will channel the "complexity, charisma, and creative genius" of Stark.
Marvel Games is collaborating on the project with the Montreal-based EA Motive. The project is currently in pre-production, and more updates will arrive as the team gets further into development.
"It’s an honor and privilege to have the opportunity to make a video game based on one of the most iconic Super Heroes in entertainment today," said executive producer Olivier Proulx in a statement today. "We have a great opportunity to create a new and unique story that we can call our own. Marvel is encouraging us to create something fresh. We have a lot of freedom, which is so engaging for the team."

More Marvel on the way
Of course, this Iron Man game isn't the only new Marvel video game collaboration. At the recent Disney and Marvel games showcase, Skydance New Media teased its upcoming game centered on Captain America and Black Panther. That project also doesn't have a title yet. But the team behind it is Amy Hennig's new studio, which is working on a Star Wars project, too.
With Midnight Suns just around the corner too, there's a lot of Marvel on the way. We'll have to wait and see what Motive is up to with its take on one of Marvel's core Avengers.

Sega has finally shared the first trailer for Netflix's upcoming animated Sonic show, Sonic Prime. The trailer also confirms that the show will debut on the streaming service this Winter, following rumours in August that it will be dropping in December.
Sonic Prime will star the titular blue hedgehog alongside Dr. Eggman, Shadow the Hedgehog, and Big the Cat, and we get a pretty good look at all four of them here, along with some action-packed scenes. The trailer also gives us a little glimpse at Sonic's new voice actor, Deven Mack.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Also, the Mega Man Battle Network Legacy Collection
The Japan Game Awards ceremony took place this past weekend at TGS 2022, and the results are in for the top 10 award-winning games. As a bit of context, each year an organization called the Computer Entertainment Association of Japan doles out awards at TGS, honoring a variety of games from multiple regions.
Here's the full list of 10 games that won the Future Division category (in no particular order), which quite literally highlights titles that are coming up, and haven't been released yet:
A Space for the Unbound
Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty
Exoprimal
Street Fighter VI
Sonic Frontiers
Final Fantasy XVI
Forspoken
Atelier Ryza 3: Alchemist of the End and the Secret Key
Like a Dragon: Ishin
Mega Man Battle Network Legacy Collection
Note that not all of these games were even playable at TGS, so the award isn't necessarily tied to quality and hands-on experience.
The two that definitely stand out are Forspoken and Sonic Frontiers, who have had polarizing receptions since their debuts. Exoprimal is also on the "wait and see" list. The rest, to a degree, makes sense. I've played the Wo Long demo and can vouch that so far, it looks really promising. With Naoki "Yoshi P" Yoshida on Final Fantasy XVI, things seem to be on track. Street Fighter VI is obviously a darling. Plus, the Mega Man Battle Network Legacy Collection award seems to have lumped in both separate SKUs, which would make it a powerhouse of a re-release.
If you're interested, the official Tokyo Game Show YouTube account uploaded the entire hour-and-a-half ceremony, which you can watch below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nearly 10 minutes of recap material
Nintendo has launched an official Splatoon 3 tutorial on their YouTube channel — which they are dubbing a "Beginner's Guide."
Clocking in at nearly five minutes, it walks you through basically everything you need to know to play the game. Even the setup! Nintendo starts simple, giving folks background info for the "kid and squid" morphing mechanic, then inking/weaponry, then game modes. It's actually super useful, as the gameplay is simplistic enough to literally watch this video, then dive in. This is going to be especially useful for the upcoming Splatfest demo, as some folks may have not played the series up through this point.
Coincidentally, you'll also get a ton of new footage for Splatoon 3. None of it is revelatory per se, but people who are really looking at every single detail until release might want to check it out, as there's a lot of environmental showcasing going on. It also serves as a nice recap of most of the stuff the team has shown so far in various Nintendo Directs and showcases.
With Splatoon 3, I'm at the point that I'm typically at in the "post-Direct" lifecycle of first-party Nintendo games. I've seen enough, I just want to play it!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bridget Be Ballin'
Fighting game modders will never cease to amaze us with their talent and ingenuity, always creating lavish costumes, fun crossovers, and other creative concepts for some of the community's most beloved games and characters. Submitted for your approval: This fantastic "Basketball Bridget" mod for Arc System Works' slick anime fighter Guilty Gear Strive.
The new look, meticulously crafted by modder manmadee, sees the happy-go-lucky scrapper trade in her nun-like hoodie and trademark Bullet Yo-Yo for some sweet gym sweats, fingerless gloves, and a meaty B-Ball. She looks adorable as all hell, and is set to take the court by storm, and I pity any luckless opponent who is getting set to take Bridget's basketball straight to the face... I mean, it's happened to us all at least once, right?
Check out this video from GAMETV. (And keep an eye out for a cameo by the Mod King at 1:10)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpJCoDzxH4s
BY THE BUCKET!
Manmadee's mod comes with several color variants, which include options for eyeglasses, cat ears, and an instantly recognizable purple-and-yellow ensemble, as worn by NBA team L.A. Lakers. Because of the yo-yo's propensity to return to Bridget's hand, it makes her basketball attacks simultaneously believable and also hilariously physics-defying — but that's all part of the fun. I think she looks fantastic, and the new gear is a great way to celebrate her highly publicized arrival to the GG Strive roster.
You can pick up Basketball Bridget, alongside manmadee's other great mods, over at GameBanana.
Guilty Gear Strive is available now on PlayStation and PC platforms. It is coming to Xbox in spring 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Switch is also 720p
Sonic Frontiers framerate variations have been revealed, according to an attendee who spoke to Sega at TGS this past weekend.
Sonic Frontiers framerate breakdown:
Based on the report, it seems like the PS5, PS4, and Switch editions will have the following options:
PS5: 4K visuals with 30 FPS — or HD visuals with 60 FPS
PS4: HD visuals with 30 FPS
Switch: 720p with 30 FPS
No information could be discerned about the Xbox editions (or PC), however, it would make perfect sense for the Xbox Series X/S to line up with the PS5 settings, with the Xbox One edition lining up with the PS4. Sega has also clarified, according to the report, that the Switch version will sport 720p30 visuals docked and in portable mode. All versions also have "variable" framerates, so performance may change, especially given that it's an open world game.
In 2022, a "performance and visual mode" toggle for a AAA game on a current platform is expected, as is 720p and 30 FPS for a third-party Switch game. All of this lines up with what anyone could have guessed on paper, but now we'll have to see if it actually plays out this way in practice. I'm a bit worried about the PC port in particular.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's more than zero.
We don't blame you if you’re intimidated by Falcom’s The Legend of Heroes: Trails series. This massive saga is now up to its twelfth mainline game in Japan, with the West falling behind at an alarming rate. However, one piece of the puzzle has been missing for years – Crossbell. After years of begging, fans are finally getting these “missing” games, starting with The Legend of Heroes: Trails from Zero. And, it turns out, there’s a reason people have been desperate to see these games get an official English localisation – Trails from Zero makes a pretty strong case for being one of the best entries in the entire series.
As with every Trails game, there’s always a caveat when trying to get into the series: Where do you start? The Switch, in particular, doesn’t make this easy, with only Trails of Cold Steel III and IV available on the platform in the West. But Trails from Zero is nowhere near as impenetrable as these future entries, with a plot and cast of characters that feel pretty self-contained. Of course, some characters from the Trails in the Sky games (which are currently only on PSP or PC here) make an appearance, references to past events slip in, and one primary plot thread is resolved from the Liberl arc, so it’s hard to deny that Trails from Zero is at its most rewarding if you’ve played Sky. But it’s much more accessible than the other two Switch offerings in the series.

We often laud Rare's incredible library of games on the N64, and while the focus has recently been on its seminal movie tie-in shooter GoldenEye 007 over the past week, we want to turn your attention to Perfect Dark for just a few minutes. Footage of one of the game's cut features from E3 1999 has been shared online.
Perfect Head mode was intended to use photos imported from the Game Boy Camera via the Transfer Pak. This would allow you to pop your face — albeit a little more polygonal than in real life — onto the heads of guards. The feature was eventually cut from the game due to tech issues, but it was shown off during E3 1999 (thanks, Time Extension!).

What’s more, according an interview with Gamers Nexus, their reasoning is a lack of “respect” shown to them by Nvidia themselves. Suffice to say, there won’t be an EVGA version of the RTX 4090 or any RTX 40 series GPU that might be announced during Nvidia’s GeForce Beyond event later today.

XSEED Games recently announced that it would be bringing SIEG Games' time-travel, emotion-driven AI RPG Loop8: Summer of Gods to Switch in 2023!

Working as senior producer on the game, Yoichi Miyaji — known for producing Lunar: The Silver Star and executive producer on the Grandia — is just one of the stand-out names working on the game. Also joining the veteran producer is fellow Lunar alum Noriyuki Iwadare (composer of Lunar and Ace Attorney series), game producer Yuri Shibamura (creator of Elemental Gearbolt and Gunparade March), character designers Shingo Adachi (Sword Art Online) and En Morikura (VTuber artist for Kizuna AI). Concept art is by Kitsuneiro (designer of Amatsu Kitsune), with mascot character designs from Ryudai Murayama (Sakuna: Of Rice and Ruin).

With two back-to-back positive showings at both Gamescom and Tokyo Game Show, the hype for Sonic Frontiers is building. And one curious attendee at last week's TGS approached Sega to find out just how the game will run. And it sounds like Sega is targeting 720p and 30fps on Switch for the blue blur's open-zone game.
Shared on ResetEra and My Nintendo News, the attendee — @tadanohi — posted the results of his chat with the representatives at the Sonic booth. Given Sonic's focus on speed, the lower resolution and frame rate — which potentially applies in both docked and undocked mode — might be a disappointment to some. However, this information hasn't officially been confirmed by Sega.

Rare's iconic first-person shooter GoldenEye 007 was thought to be stuck in licensing hell, but after ongoing rumours and last week's Nintendo Direct, it was officially announced for the Switch Online N64 service. It's coming to Xbox Game Pass and Rare Replay with some minor enhancements, too.
Sure, it might not be the axed remaster that leaked last year, however, it's better than nothing. We can't help but wonder though what might have happened if Nightdive Studios (Shadow Man, PowerSlave) had been given the right to revive this classic instead of Rare. According to the studio's CEO Stephen Kick, Nightdive apparently came incredibly close to securing the re-release. Here's what he had to say:

At last week's Nintendo Direct, a new Fire Emblem game was revealed. Fire Emblem Engage had been rumoured for some time and will now be arriving on the Switch early next year on 20th January 2023.
If you're planning on picking up a digital copy of this game, it seems Nintendo's official website has now provided an idea of the new entry's size. According to the listing, the digital version will require around 15 GB of free space on your Switch. Keep in mind, that this is subject to change between now and release.

Resident Evil Village left us off on a wild note, with so much room to speculate about the near and long-term future of the series. In between releases, it's always been fun for me to put the pieces together, theorize, and then ultimately see Capcom take a different direction than the clues might've suggested. A new quote out of Tokyo Game Show 2022 has rekindled the conversation, specifically with respect to the upcoming Shadows of Rose DLC for Resident Evil Village and where the series could go with the next mainline entry.
As reported by IGN out of Tokyo Game Show, director Kento Kinoshita says that Capcom is "creating the Shadows of Rose story to conclude the Winters family saga."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Does he have an anti-nausea superpower too?
In theory, getting a first-person view as Spider-Man swinging around New York sounds like the coolest thing ever, because who doesn't want to be Spidey? In practice, though, it's a bit of a nightmare — I can't even look at the screen for more than a few seconds without being overcome with nausea. But if you can stomach the herky-jerky camera, and if you're just dying to play Spider-Man in first-person, this new mod has you covered.
Spider-Man's release for PC means that modding the game just got a whole lot easier, hence why the aptly named "Spider-Man PC First Person Mod Web Swinging" mod by well-known GTA V and Red Dead Redemption 2 modder Jedijosh920 has gained some attention online. They also released a slightly less stomach-churning video where the camera stays fixed in place as Spidey spins and flips around, so that's at least a little bit better.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mylHkF4ExBE
Mind you, I used to be a roller coaster junkie, but unfortunately as I've gotten older, my motion sickness has only gotten worse and worse. When I came across the video showcasing the mod on Twitter, I had to scroll away pretty fast at risk of ending up like Liza Minnelli in Arrested Development. 
Even so, I have to admit that this is something I'd like to experience, motion sickness permitting — although it's pretty sad to be hit in the face with the reality that I wouldn't be able to handle life as a web-slinging superhero simply because I get sick by moving around too much. Oh well, I was never made for the crime-fighting life anyway.
Either way, it's always fun to see modders put a new spin on some of our favorite games, and to the brave souls out there who are somehow playing this in VR, I commend you. Your stomach is much stronger than mine.

Publisher Leoful has announced PiXEL's 16-bit inspired adventure Xiaomei and the Flame Dragon's Fist is headed west on Nintendo Switch, following on from its quiet release on PC in 2019. The Switch port is expected to arrive before the end of the year, although a specific release date was not announced.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lwnDx4qnAo
Xiaomei and the Flame Dragon's Fist, (originally titled Fire Dragon Fist Master Xiao-Mei), is an ultra-retro scrapper inspired by the first scrolling brawler of all time, Irem's 1984 coin-op Kung Fu Master. Operating on a simple 2D plane, the player guides the beautiful young martial arts specialist as she battles her way through a relentless throng of bandits, monsters, and crazed animals on a mission to save her sister Xiaoyin from the evil influence of the mysterious Dark Dragon.
The Nintendo Switch port, which launched in Japan back in May, features some tweaks and improvements from the original PC release. These include an alternate mode featuring Xiaoyin herself; brand new cutscenes — ably voiced by popular idol unit Suika; improved FM sound effects; a gallery mode; and a remixed soundtrack, composed by Sega veteran Hirofumi Murasaki, (of Shinobi III and Dragon Force fame). So if you're yet to experience the simple-but-frantic action of Xiaomei's world, then this incoming localization will offer the best experience yet.
Xiaomei and the Dragon's Fist will launch in the west on Nintendo Switch later this year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Decks keep rolling out
Valve has once again beaten its estimates for Steam Deck reservations. Today, the company confirms it has sent all reservations for the Q3 window.
The Q3 bucket, ranging from July to September, is slightly ahead of pace and so Valve is already getting a head-start on Q4. The store's already been updated with a new description, as it extends from September on through December.
The Deck manufacturer announced in July that it has been fulfilling demand sooner than estimated for the portable PC. As such, Valve started bumping reservations up further in the queue.
Now, it looks like those Q4 reservations are starting to roll out. So that's a PSA, for those of you waiting on Steam Deck tickets, to get your wallets ready.

More on deck
That's not the only Steam Deck news from the last few days, either. The official dock for the Steam Deck was on display at last week's Tokyo Game Show 2022, as shared around on sites like Reddit.
While some third-party solutions have been around, Valve's official dock has been delayed. I've since picked up a powered USB hub for my own purposes, and it does a decent amount of what any dock would do. But the ability to prop up and park the Deck in it, like a Switch dock, is a big part of the appeal.
No target window has been set for the release of the Steam Deck dock. "We're working on improving the situation and will share more info when we have it," reads the official statement from the time.
Still, while the dock is backed up, the Steam Deck seems to be flying off the production line. Those who are in line for one should hopefully not be waiting too much longer to get their reservation email.

Publisher Apogee Entertainment has offered an update on its incoming remake of '90s shooter Rise of the Triad. The cult-smashing blaster will make its grand return on PC and console platforms in 2023, in the form of Rise of the Triad: Ludicrous Edition. A physical edition is en route from Limited Run Games.
Originally released in 1995, at the height of DOOM-clone mania, Rise of the Triad puts the player in control of a member of special operations squad HUNT, tasked with investigating a mysterious island on the American coast. The team quickly learns of a doomsday cult planning to obliterate Los Angeles, and takes swift and decisive measures to prevent this frightening eventuality... They fucking kill everybody is what I'm saying.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's a leaky start to the week
One major game has already seen a major leak of info, and now it looks like another is joining the lineup. A leak of early footage of Diablo IV has been making the rounds, showing off more of the RPG in action.
Spotted by sites like PC Gamer, a Reddit user linked some footage from a filesharing site which seems to have footage from a private test build of Diablo IV.
We've looked at the footage to verify its existence and yes, it sure does look like Diablo. Alongside the giant watermarks plastered across the video, it's got shops, towns, and placeholders.
We reached out to Blizzard for confirmation of the footage's validity and comment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RdDpqCmjb4
Numbers go up
It was a notable weekend for leaks, as a massive pile of Grand Theft Auto VI footage also found its way online. Rockstar confirmed the leak's validity this morning, adding a statement addressing the leak.
"We are extremely disappointed to have any details of our next game shared with you all in this way. Our work on the next Grand Theft Auto game will continue as planned, and we remain as committed as ever to delivering an experience to you, our players, that truly exceeds your expectations. We will update everyone again soon, and of course, will properly introduce you to this next game when it is ready."

Unlike GTA, we've seen quite a bit of Diablo IV through various previews and trailers. Still, a leak's a leak, and this puts some footage out without any context.
Blizzard has not commented on the leak as of this writing. The studio has released an update on Diablo IV, however. An endgame closed beta is on the way, with direct invites rolling out using gameplay data.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be2ZlWW0fwM
Diablo IV is still a ways off, at the very least until next year. And a lot has been happening over at Activision Blizzard as well.

If you take even a quick glance at a release schedule for the next six months, you'll see that there are a heck of a lot of games coming out. Look a little closer, though, and you'll spot that maybe 50 of them are from Square Enix. And that's just on the Switch!
We're exaggerating, of course, but it's hard to ignore the company's absolutely massive output over the next few months — and for the whole of 2022, really. We're not going to list every single 2022 Square Enix Switch release here because that would take up a lot of space (though you can check all of its games out right here, or scroll to the bottom of this article). However, from September until next year Square Enix is developing and/or publishing 13 games on Switch alone. Phew! And of course, we're including PowerWash Simulator in that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It debuted at TGS, but there's a full English audio translation
While Octopath Traveler 2 is slated for release on February 23, 2023, on PC, PS4, PS5, and Switch, we can catch a chunk of it now. If you wanted some Octopath Traveler 2 footage following the recent Nintendo Direct reveal, you got it! Square Enix just gave us 20 minutes of it thanks to a TGS stream. Don't worry though! Although the stream was done for TGS, there's a full live English translation baked in as audio commentary.
Kicking off at roughly 25:00 in the below video, we get a full 20-minute walkthrough of the game, and some of the aesthetic and design changes in the sequel. One big element that the team showcases is elevation, which brings "height and depth" to the maps. There's a bit of variation involved with the game's designs, with footage of a forest village and an "old west-like town."
Based on this Octopath Traveler 2 footage, natural time progression is in, too, and there will be "drastically different music" in some day/night cycles, including tracks that sound unique compared to the original. The team wanted to ensure that there wasn't a sense of repetition between playing the original and the sequel, and it gave them a good excuse to "explore different genres" of music to boot. The developers mused on how much of an undertaking it was, having to design day/night music for all of the locations in the game, only a portion of which were shown off via a brief look at the world map (31:00 in).
Ideally, Octopath Traveler 2 will address some of the common complaints of the original (including how things homogenize after the individual character stories are completed): because so far, they're still nailing the aesthetic.

Anime RPG Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot is on its way to PS5 and Xbox Series X, confirmed publisher Bandai Namco during the past week's Tokyo Game Show festivities. The 2020 adventure title is currently back in development at CyberConnect2, and is preparing to wow fans in 2023 with an impressive new rerelease on current-gen console platforms.
The new versions of Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot — which is already available on PS4, PC, Xbox One, Stadia, and Nintendo Switch — will sport improved textures as well as boosted light, shadow, and water effects. A short comparison clip, which you can check out below, depicts the open-world adventure running on modern hardware, and it has to be said it is quite an attractive upgrade, given that the original version is already an authentic adaptation of the legendary anime franchise.
https://twitter.com/dragonballgames/status/1570761217618108416?s=20&t=tUNx-l32ofCdOGVmpgfJFA
In addition to the new ports, Bandai Namco also revealed a new DLC story expansion, that will focus on the arrival of Son Goku's father, Bardock. The Bardock: Alone Against Fate DLC will be a loose retelling of the events depicted in the 1990 OVA Dragon Ball Z: Bardock – The Father of Goku. The story expansion will cover events such as Bardock's time as part of Frieza Force, and the arrival of his legendary son. The new DLC is the first of three story expansions, which should keep Kakarot fans engaged for the coming year, at the very least.
Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot for PS5 and Xbox Series X and the Bardock: Alone Against Fate DLC will launch together in 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[See more than others ever have
Developer Sorath blasted onto the scene in 2016 with the first-person arcade shooter Devil Daggers. Now, the studio is back with another bizarre shooter, with possibly even more mind-bending action in Hyper Demon.
Hyper Demon launches today on PC via Steam, for $14.99. As the tag advertises, it's about slaying demons in a world like no other. And, apparently, from a view like no other either.
The faster you slay demons in Hyper Demon, the harder the game gets. But your score also ramps higher and higher. There is, apparently, an end. The question is, can you make it there?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScglDSi9KUs
Much like Devil Daggers, Hyper Demon has minimal controls. Collecting gems will allow players to buff up their capabilities, or charge up and execute massive super moves.
The trippy effect you see on the screen is what developer Sorath describes as "groundbreaking spherical projection," which gives the player a wide peripheral view without pinching or shrinking the center of the screen. It is truly something to see in motion. And it allows for fields of view stretching out to 180 degrees.
Alongside that, the game also has a holographic rear view overlay. So basically, you can have complete 360-degree awareness, if you can learn to visually parse all the chaos happening on the field.
The devil inside
Devil Daggers was definitely a memorable experience from 2016. It had a dark and intense vibe, taking the general concept of being a devil who shoots magic daggers from their fingers into an arena shooter frenzy.
Its visuals were particularly wild, so it's cool to see Hyper Demon continue to push this into almost surreal places. With a surprise launch too, this is a nice Monday morning surprise for folks who love visually unique arena shooters.
Hyper Demon is out now for PC on Steam.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The last time we heard about this port was roughly three years ago
Three years ago, Xbox boss Phil Spencer gave us hope that Final Fantasy XIV on Xbox was a distinct possibility. But it's still in limbo. I even reached out to Microsoft and Square Enix in 2020 to see if any movement had been made, and was given a "no comment" response from both parties.
Yet, Japanese site Game Watch spoke to Spencer at TGS 2022, who gave a brief comment on the situation. The short of it? There's still no major progress on Final Fantasy XIV on Xbox, but talks aren't completely dead yet. Here's what he had to say:
"We certainly announced that (laughs). Naturally, we haven’t given up yet. This is a commitment from both Microsoft and Square Enix to gamers and we will continue to coordinate our efforts."

It's not much to go on, to be sure! But at the same time, it's comforting that Spencer, in 2022, isn't willing to throw in the towel yet. Back in 2020, Final Fantasy XIV producer Naoki "Yoshi P" Yoshida noted that it would take a lot of resources to make that happen, so perhaps the wheels are still being greased: "we have to think about long-term planning with additional platforms, we need additional testing for that particular platform. So it kind of exponentially grows the amount of resources that needs to be allocated."
There's also the consideration of Microsoft and Sony working in tandem, given that they need to cooperate for the game to function cross-platform. Currently, Final Fantasy XIV is available on PC, PS4, and PS5. With the move to the Xbox platform, with full cross-play and cross-progression intact (this is something Square Enix has been hardline on), it would be an even more formidable MMO force to be reckoned with, with a bigger audience.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blowing minds and blowing chunks
Suda51's new YouTube series gives you something you can't get from everybody, because not every game developer loves the public eye. Despite being as famous (and infamous) as most folks in the industry will ever get, you're not likely to see a new on-camera interview with Minecraft's Notch or FEZ's Phil Fish anytime soon. Putting your personal struggles on display isn't for everyone.
Suda51 has no such misgivings about showing the human side of the creative process. In fact, the very first game company he worked for was called HUMAN, and as he explains in this inaugural chapter of a tell-all interview series, it was Suda's soft and heartfelt love of games and pro wrestling that landed him the job. That combination of excitement and fear was key to his subsequent success. As he tells it, those feelings also led to a fair amount of vomit in his mouth.
https://youtu.be/FW0bOm_fYDw
This same mix of thrills, chills, and stomach-turning spills are part of most of his games, from early titles like soon to be rereleased action-and-horror titles like Lollipop Chainsaw, Fatal Frame: Mask of the Lunar Eclipse, and No More Heroes 3. What you make comes from who you are, even if that means tasting a little of your own puke now and again.
This new "Creator's File" interview series also marks a rebrand for Grasshopper and Suda51's new YouTube channel. It will feature other members of the company as well, as they talk about their history and experiences in the industry. It's a perfect holdover for fans of the studio as they wait for the announcement of new Grasshopper projects. I've gotten a little of the inside scoop on one of their unannounced titles and it's definitely going to be a big hit with fans of Suda's scriptwriting style.
Keep an eye peeled in the video and you may actually see a hint of what they're working on.

Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes got a brand new trailer, and this is the most detailed look we've seen of the upcoming turn-based RPG.
This brand-new trailer expands on the one we got during Gamescom in August, and it looks gorgeous. This is also the first trailer to show us the game's voice acting, which was actually a stretch goal during the game's Kickstarter campaign. And while we were hoping for a more concrete release date, we're still happy to see the game is on-track for 2023.

As we look toward the future, and the release of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom next May, a lot of folks I've spoken to recently are reflecting on the past. Zelda: Breath of the Wild, that is! Some have taken to cleanup runs to try and clear out some final tasks once and for all, and this Breath of the Wild companion book is a great way to do that.
Crafted by RowanFN1 on Reddit, this cute little journal is reminiscent of old school instruction manuals: checklists and all. There's sections for the main quest, Sheikah Towers, region logs, DLC shrines, homecare, horse equipment, armor and gear, helpful recipes, and of course, a free hand notepad section.

Fun fact: at this time last year, we had only just learned of the existence of Voice of Cards: The Isle Dragon Roars. Not only has that game and its sequel—Voice of Cards: The Forsaken Maiden—come out since then, but we’ve now received yet another sequel in Voice of Cards: The Beasts of Burden. As you’d probably expect, this newest entry is largely cut from the same cloth as its predecessors, but with some meaningful nips and tucks here and there that help to give it its own personality.
The Beasts of Burden follows the story of a girl named Al’e (by default, you can name her whatever you want) who dreams of one day seeing the stars. Al’e lives in an underground village beset by frequent monster attacks, which are slowly chipping away at their limited supplies and remaining residents. Al’e is quite the capable warrior, but while she’s out fending off yet another monster swarm, another group of monsters manages to sneak into the village and kill everyone there. Grieving the loss of her mother and friends, Al’e is then whisked to the surface by a mysterious boy who seems to want to help. Here, she learns that she holds a special power that allows her to control monsters to do her bidding. Armed with this newfound ability and aided by her new ally, Al’e sets out on a quest for revenge against the ones behind the incident that destroyed her home.

After several adventures with other devs, sometime-mighty pirate Guybrush Threepwood (a name that invites as many tedious jokes as Benedict Cumberbatch, which is a trap I won't be falling into) is back with his some of his original progenitors Ron Gilbert and Dave Grossman - Gilbert being the director for the first two Islands Monkey.
I was expecting Return To Monkey Island to be a delightful croquembouche of point and click puzzles artfully piled up with puns and meta jokes, all slathered in the sticky, sugary caramel of nostalgia. And it is that. But I wasn't expecting it to contain a gentle rumination on getting old and figuring out what things are really worth caring about.

More Final Fantasy XVI footage is still a little ways out, according to producer Naoki Yoshida at Tokyo Game Show 2022.
As reported by Gematsu, Yoshida took the stage at TGS this past weekend to accept a Future Division Award for Square Enix. While he had the mic, he took the opportunity to explain why Final Fantasy XVI wasn't at the show: "I haven’t gotten a chance to talk to the marketing or public relations teams at all, so I’m not sure how much I’m allowed to say, but I think we’ll probably be able to release the next trailer next month or so… And after that, I hope to be able to give a rough idea of when it will be released."
We could get the Final Fantasy XVI release date in October
Yoshida is famously known for not wanting to show things unless there's more concrete info to actually showcase, which is counter to how Square Enix infamously reveals a lot of their projects. The two big takeaways from this statement from Yoshida not only hint at an October trailer release/an event of some sort, but a potential release date.
At the moment, we do have a window though! It's still "summer 2023" on PS5 as of this month.

La-Mulana series director Takumi Naramura has proven his chops at creating games inspired by the MSX computer, and now it looks like he's going to get his hands on one of the most well-known games on the system. The director has won a competition run by Konami to have the chance at remaking the 1987 classic, The Maze of Galious, IGN reports.
How did Naramura get the chance to direct this remake, then? By winning a year-long competition. Konami held this to allow indie developers the chance to show their skills and revive some of Konami's older titles. And Naramura won first place, as announced at this year's Tokyo Game Show.

Several years ago, back when covering PlayStation Vita games was still a viable option for gaming websites, I took a chance on a review for an indie adventure game called Demetrios: The Big Cynical Adventure. Not to rehash bad memories, but like many of the reviews I go out on my own to find, I didn’t care for it too much. Clearly, others did. The game has been ported to just about every major piece of hardware on the market, including a 4K version on the PlayStation 5 and Japanese localization on the eShop.
While the game’s creator, Fabrice Breton, and I didn’t see eye to eye on the game, several months after my review was published, he invited me to take an extremely early look at his next project. Squeezing out an unoptimized Mac version of the demo, I thought the concep…]]></summary>

Bandai Namco is teaming with Steamforged Games to produce a board game variant of its stellar RPG release, Elden Ring. As reported by Eurogamer, the tabletop edition of the mega-selling 2022 release will launch a preliminary crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter "soon."
While there are very little in the way of images or details pertaining to the adaptation, Steamforged Games has revealed that Elden Ring will see one to four Tarnished players embark on a whole new adventure in The Lands Between, visiting familiar locations and locking steel with a rogues' gallery of recognizable and formidable opponents. The board game will feature "characteristically challenging" dice-free combat, relying on strategy and adaptation in order to survive the encounter.

"Elden Ring is a stunning, genre-defining video game, and we are humbled and privileged to be bringing it to your tabletops. To say our team is passionate about the game would be an understatement," says Steamforged CCO Mat Hart in a press release. "Our mission is always to deliver authentic tabletop adaptations that capture the essence of what fans know and love about the IP. Fans should expect a dark, richly-realised tabletop world of mystery and peril, with satisfying combat and rewarding exploration. Prepare to lose hours to this game, and to be glad about it."
This is not, obviously, Steamforged's first rodeo in the world of tabletop video game adaptations. Previously, the company has developed board and card games based on popular franchises such as Dark Souls, Monster Hunter World, Resident Evil, Horizon: Zero Dawn, Pac-Man, and Devil May Cry. We will be sure to give you a heads-up right here on Destructoid when the Elden Ring campaign goes live.
For more information on the new game's format, check out the official Steamforged Games website.

One massive 1600W 80+ Platinum unit has been highly discounted over in the States, where the EVGA SuperNova 1600 P+ is down to $200 from its original price of $500. That's an awesome deal on a power supply ideally suited for high-end, multiple-GPU systems - and doesn't cost much more than a Platinum-rated 1000W PSU.

A mysterious leak has surfaced online, claiming to showcase development footage, screenshots, and plot details pertaining to Rockstar Games' upcoming sequel Grand Theft Auto 6 — the assets were uploaded to popular GTA 6 community GTA Forums overnight.
The videos, all of which have since been removed from YouTube, included footage of unfinished player characters and NPCs traversing a strip club, using an intercity metro train, and robbing a fast food restaurant, Pumpkin and Honey Bunny style. This footage (assuming that it's legitimate) would validate earlier reports that the GTA 6 narrative will focus on "Bonnie and Clyde"-style dual protagonists.
In total, around 90 video clips (mostly only seconds long) were archived in the leak, with some builds dating back to 2019/2020…]]></summary>

The 80-some clips seemingly show everything from full, in-game scenarios to clearly unfinished bits of grey boxing, but you won't find a link to them here, because the truth is, they're simply not worth looking at. What possible benefit could they provide anyone right here, right now? The leaker gets their five minutes of fame and an influx of new followers, sure. But GTA 6 itself isn't going to look anything like what you see in those clips when it's actually finished, so someone please tell me, what is even the point?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Castle Dimitrescu was one of the many highlights of Resident Evil Village, so it makes sense that Capcom are returning to it in the game's upcoming DLC adventure, Shadows Of Rose. Set 16 years after the events of Village, this story expansion centres on Rose, the daughter of Village protagonist Ethan Winters, as she comes to terms with her emerging mold powers. She was just a teeny, tiny baby when her dad was fighting off the very tall vampire lady in the base game, but now she's all grown up and wants to be rid of the supernatural spore abilities that have been plaguing her family ever since the events of Resident Evil 7. 
It's not yet clear what role Lady D's castle has to play in Rose's journey, but man, it sure is nice to be back roaming its ornate hallways again. Or rather it would be, if it weren't for all the ashen mold men stalking its corridors, and its rather gross (but strangely hypnotic) rivers of undulating strawberry jam gore that have been plastered all over the walls, floor and ceiling. Ach, now it's on my shoes. Great. And the gate's locked behind me. Fantastic. I knew coming back here would be a bad idea…

Chun-Li
Dee Jay
Dhalsim
E. Honda

Many of these fighters made their first appearances in Street Fighter (Ken and Ryu) or Street Fighter II (Blanka, Cammy, Chun-Li, Dee Jay, Dhalsim, E. Honda, Guile, Zangief). However, some fresher faces include Juri (debuted in Street Fighter IV) and Luke (debuted in Street Fighter V), and six all-new characters: Jamie, JP, Kimberly, Lily, Manon, and Marisa.

The result is a package that feels more novel than other titles in the …]]></summary>

After only a few rounds, I had a tough time wanting to switch to anyone else.
If you haven’t been keeping up, Kimberly is a ninja pupil of Guy who adores the ‘80s and graffiti.

The Pokémon franchise has been more prolific than usual as of late, with multiple releases over the past year and another big entry coming soon. However, those without a Switch or looking for a suitable monster-battling alternative should focus on Temtem, which has emerged from years of early-access development.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Man, I was worried this week. I've had a string of possible reports that were all disappointingly tepid. Then I played Trail Out, a chaotic crash-and-ram racing game with, for some reason, a story mode about a former stunt driver who is very much some guy. I'm still not sure if he's talking to himself, through the fourth wall, or to his dog. His best friend wears a gas mask and lifts weights in the junkyard without breaking eye contact.
The racing is very solid, but more importantly it has character. Odd, odd character.

It’ll bring themed festival foods to the game, along with some staggeringly well-balanced beer steins. Arktoberfest is the first big event to come to Lost Ark in the West that wasn't in the original Korean and Russian version of the game.

In my report on the latter I made some passing references to a novelty oversized Deck that Valve were building for their TGS booth, completely unaware of how often I’d find myself admiring it a few days later. See, the Steam Deck booth at TGS, from the towering scale model to the weirdly impressive elegance of its logistics, might be the finest event booth I’ve ever seen.

Given the latter game’s events and the tantalizing trailer for its second part, Rebirth, it had me thinking that it may be a good time to dust off my copy of 2008’s Crisis Core. Square Enix read my mind by announcing a remaster of Zack Fair’s PSP adventure, christening it with the subtitle “Reunion,” giving newcomers the answer to the question of “who the heck was that black-haired fella in Remake?” As for me, I thought I had a good reason to return to the game. After playing a decent chunk of Reunion at Tokyo Game Show, I’m all good. 
My expectations were always reasonable. Reunion is a remaster, not a remake the scale of, well, Remake. That means that feature-wise, the best way to sum it up is “That PSP game? You can pl…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let me fill you in on a little secret most people won't tell you: the real way to enjoy a video game show is at home, comfortably on your couch, watching the event on YouTube. 
Over the years, the game press has done a remarkable job tricking you into thinking otherwise. The shows look extravagant, energetic, and almost like we're getting glimpses into the future, which we then curate into bite-sized news stories and on-demand trailers for our faithful readers back home. 
The reality is much more depressing.
Whether it's E3, PAX, Gamescom, or in this case, Tokyo Game Show, going to a video game trade event means dealing with the near-lethal combination of jetlag and overwork. The brutal FOMO of being in some of the coolest cities in the world but spending all your time in convention halls. The unbelievable cacophony of thousands of people talking at once. The unbelievable smells of thousands of people all standing too close to each other. The never-ending lines of thousands of people all needing to use the toilet at the same time. This doesn't even touch on the unavoidable safety concerns of having a video game conference in the midst of an ongoing pandemic. But I digress.
All that said, there's some fun stuff to look at, like big, gaudy statues and giant booths that likely cost tens of thousands of dollars for games you've never heard of and likely will never play. Stuff that really makes it all worth it. 
While we'd love to fly each and every one of you out to Tokyo, sadly, we only had the budget to fly out two of our full-time employees. So in lieu of attending yourself, please enjoy my curated batch of pictures of what I saw on the show floor. 
Well, there you have it, folks. All the fun of TGS without actually being there. See you next year!]]></summary>

When Resident Evil 4 Remake was revealed during a PlayStation State of Play held back in June, Capcom said it was coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, with no mention of old-gen consoles like the PS4 and Xbox One.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Clearly in direct response to that one moan I had about the lack of reliable GeForce RTX 40 series info, Nvidia are now teasing what’s very likely a launch event for their next generation of GPUs. The official Nvidia GeForce Twitter account has been vagueposting about something called #ProjectBeyond, starting with a coded image on September 8th and more recently listing a date and time: 8am PDT (4pm BST) on September 20th.
Given it’s about time in Nvidia’s preferred biannual cycle for a new graphics card generation, and it being the GeForce account rather than one of Nvidia’s non-gaming brands, and Nvidia also dropping the cryptic stuff and just straight-up confirming a "GeForce Beyond" show on the 20th, you can bet your sweet memory bus that September 20th will see some kind of RTX GPU announcement. The RTX 30 series, which has contributed most of the past two years’ best graphics cards, will finally begin its journey into semi-retirement.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yesterday at the Tokyo Games Show, Capcom formally announced the addition of Ken, Blanka, E.Honda and Dhalsim to the Street Fighter 6 roster. Technically, none of this should come as a surprise. Not only are they all Street Fighter faithfuls, but pretty much the entire cast list got leaked back in June thanks to some rogue character art. One thing that has been pleasantly surprising, however, is learning that Ken, pictured in that leaked document as looking rather dishevelled and rocking a bit of a 'sad, middle-aged dad' look, is anything but.
Indeed, when I went to play the latest build of Street Fighter 6 at Capcom's UK offices earlier in the week, Ken was absolutely killing it. Rather than suffering from a mid-life crisis, Ken was hauling it across the screen like an absolute battering ram, clearly full of the same mad protein shakes his mate Ryu's been hawking down since their last SF outing, as both of them have gone full-on Redfield Beefcake this time.

More specifically, these two remasters will be packaged into the same collection and this remastered duo is due out on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC (via Steam) in 2023. The first Suikoden was released in 1995, and its sequel, Suikoden II, was released in 1998. Check out what the remastered versions of these classic games look like in the announcement trailer below: 


As you can see, these remasters are looking excellent, especially in the way that the original look and feel of the sprite imagery remains intact. Here's hoping they feel as great to play as they did back in the day. 
Here are some highlights of this remastered collection from the game's Steam page:

During today's Call of Duty: Next livestream, Activision revealed a ton of new information surrounding the next phase of Call of Duty, which kicks off this fall. It begins on October 28 with Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II, the next mainline entry in the franchise, but perhaps culminates on November 16, when Call of Duty: Warzone 2.0 lanches free for everyone. Today brought us a look at what to expect when those experiences arrive later this year, as well as a glimpse at a mobile version of Warzone coming next year.

Integrating numbers from HowLongToBeat, most Game Pass games' pages now suggests how long a game is in several playstyles: finishing the main story; doing the main story and optional extras; and absolutely 100%ing everything. While I usually find talk of game length is tied into awful opinions that longer is better, I think this is great info to know on Game Pass.

As you can imagine, this is an easier task for Nate than it is to me, because many of his favourite games are predicated around era changes. Thus I find myself in the position of arguing semantics. How the turn tables have turned.
I'm able to win Nate around on at least one of my desperate bids to classify things that aren't eras as eras, although he does promptly shut me down on the most ridiculous one. It may surprise you to know that we don't actually talk about too many history games (although time travel comes up a lot). And stick around for a thrilling Cavern Of Lies. Will the Red Baron (me) be shot down at last?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hand Of Fate was such a singular thing. On the one hand, it was a tabletop deckbuilding game that saw you picking through roguelike-style dungeons by choosing different cards dealt out by its mysterious Dealer. On the other, it was also an action-packed hack and slasher, bringing its fantastical fight sections to life in fully 3D combat arenas - and there hasn't been anything quite like it since. Voice Of Cards certainly had a go, but its tedious battle system landed it straight on its own discard pile. Thankfully, we've now got the infinitely more engaging Foretales, a new narrative card game from French developers Alkemi, and it comes pretty damn close to capturing that Hand Of Fate goodness. 
It doesn't ever venture into the realms of 3D admittedly, erring more toward the Inscryption school of tabletop combat encounters, but it does nail the delivery of telling an artful, swashbuckling adventure through cards and cards alone. And much like Hand Of Fate, this isn't a one and done affair, either, as there are multiple paths to take through this entertaining fantasy yarn, and several game-changing decisions you'll have to make as you try and avert a string of terrible visions threatening to destroy its anthropomorphic animal world. You won't succeed at preventing them all during a single playthrough, but its hard choices only make its overarching story that much more gripping.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Saturnalia is an upcoming survival horror game with an extremely unique art style announced last month. Now, we know when we can play it because Saturnalia has captured an October 27 release date. 
That's when it will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC (via the Epic Games Store). Developed by Italy-based studio Santa Ragione, the team behind games like Fotonica, MirrorMoon EP, and Wheels of Aurelia, Saturnalia is shaping up to be a great time. You can find out why in the New Gameplay Today segment we recorded that's all about Saturnalia, featuring more than 15 minutes of gameplay, below: 


"[Saturnalia] is a kaleidoscopic adventure inspired in equal parts by authentic Sardinian folklore and classic Italian Giallo horror films," a press release reads. "The story involves a mysterious, centuries-old ritual that occurs every year on the night of the winter solstice in the Italian village of Gravoi. Each of the game's four playable characters must utilize their unique abilities and confront their own personal revelations in order to expose the secrets haunting the town and ultimately escape their doom."
Here are some additional Saturnalia highlights from Santa Ragione: 
Seek clues in a maze-like village with no markers or compass to guide your steps.
Explore the ever-changing town of Gravoi using matches to keep the dark at bay.
Flight and stealth are your only options, as you cannot fight the creature that hunts you.
Immerse yourself in the stop-motion animation and vibrant expressionist art style of Saturnalia for an eerily beautiful atmosphere that is as enthralling as it is chilling.
Control your fate through non-linear progression and a dynamic, adaptive narrative, with unique endgames dependent on player choices.


Saturnalia hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC via the Epic Games Store on October 27.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Disney Dreamlight Valley is a glittering life simulator in which you — having somehow slipped out of the real world into a kind of Disney-sponsored coma — find yourself living alongside all of your favourite intellectual property. Your mission? Emotionally manipulate the awful dog-beast Goofy by gifting him dandelions and bream until he becomes your best friend, then set about working on Scrooge McDuck and the rest.
Before we dive too far into this thing: if you’re here because you’ve got a kid and you just want to know if Disney Dreamlight Valley will make them happy, and that the rat from Ratatouille doesn’t say the f-word, and that at no point does Ariel drag herself onto the beach to try to recruit them into a multi-level marketing scam, then you’re golden. Disney Dreamlight Valley is a top-marks Animal Crossing rip-off that will make fans of too-big mice irreversibly giddy. Your children may eventually need a special operation to stop them smiling.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Kiriko is the newest support character arriving with the launch of Overwatch 2 PvP on October 4. She wields kunai, teleports through walls to allies, burst heals teammates with talismans, and can make nearby allies briefly invulnerable with her Protection Suzu move. Oh, and her ultimate summons a fox spirit who rushes ahead and buffs friendlies that follow behind. 
Kiriko will be free for all Overwatch 1 players, or you can earn her by reaching Tier 55 on the battle pass' free track. Of course, you will instantly unlock the character alongside newcomers Sojourn and Junker Queen by purchasing the premium battle pass. Not only is Kiriko the first support capable of keeping up with fast characters like Tracer and Genji, but the development team informed us her healing output should be similar to Moira and Mercy. 


Kiriko's Abilities In Overwatch 2
Protection Suzu – Upon impact, allies in the area become briefly invulnerable and are cleansed of most negative effects.
Kunai – Thrown projectile that deals increased critical damage.
Swift Step – Teleport directly to an ally, even through walls.
Healing Ofuda – Channel a burst of healing talismans that can seek targeted allies.
Kitsune Rush – Summon a fox spirit that rushes forward, accelerating the movement, attack speed, and cooldowns of allies that follow its path.
Wall Climb – Jump at walls to climb up them. 
Season 1 of Overwatch 2 releases for free on October 4 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.]]></summary>

Available now on PC through Steam, The Judgment Collection includes Judgment, its sequel Lost Judgment, and The Kaito Files story expansion all into one handy bundle. That sure is a whole lot of judgment. Watch the trailer below for more than your daily recommended dose of kick-punching action.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tokyo Game Show 2022 will run from Sept. 15 through Sept. 18, and Sega has helped kick off the event with a new Sonic Frontiers trailer. 
It feature more Sonic Frontiers gameplay, which consists of the blue blur climbing colossal machines as if they're mountains, but when he reaches the top of one, he stumbles upon something very special: a Chaos Emerald. As any Sonic fan likely knows, collecting all of these will help the hedgehog transform into Super Sonic, a Saiyan-like version of the character that's faster and stronger. And sure enough, that's exactly what happens in this new TGS Sonic Frontiers trailer. 
Check it out for yourself below: 


As you can see, this is the first appearance of Super Sonic in Sonic Frontiers' marketing thus far. It's also the first confirmation that Super Sonic is in the game. This trailer is another exciting Sonic Frontiers trailer showcasing more of what we can expect when the game hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on November 8. 
For more Sonic Frontiers, read about what you should expect from Sonic Frontiers' story and then read why one Game Informer editor says Sonic Frontiers is the first Sonic game he's actually wanted to play since Dreamcast.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio has announced that its Yakuza-adjacent Judgment series will make its way to Steam for the first time. The best news: they're out on Steam today.
Judgment and Lost Judgment come to Steam on September 14. This marks the first appearance of each game on PC (though Judgment has been available to stream on PC via Stadia). 
This news is especially significant given that RGG Studio originally planned to release Lost Judgment on PC when it launched last year. However, that version was nixed when the talent agency representing actor Takuya Kimura, who portrays protagonist Takayuki Yagami, enforced strict policies about allowing Kimura’s likeness on PC. Both parties' inability to agree threatened Judgment’s future as a franchise since RGG Studio has pushed for more of its titles to come to Steam; every mainline Yakuza game is available on the storefront, for example. It would appear those issues have been ironed out, which bodes well for the potential of a third game. 
The Judgment games are noir action thrillers that adhere to the same open-world design template as the Yakuza series. Though the plots largely unfold in Kamurocho, the series stars a new cast of characters and emphasizes investigative gameplay. Players control Yagami, a disgraced lawyer and private detective who works to unravel a pair of conspiracy plots. In Yakuza fashion, he also has his hands full helping his colorful clients and random citizens solve more light-hearted – or comically absurd – problems.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio, the team behind the popular and long-running Yakuza franchise, revealed yesterday that it's remaking Like A Dragon: Ishin and releasing it for the first time in the West next year. That reveal trailer looked great, but it was short and sweet. 
Now, RGG has released a new "Ambush" trailer that showcases more than five minutes of Like A Dragon: Ishin, giving us a better look at this upcoming Yakuza spinoff. Like A Dragon: Ishin was first released on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 3 in 2014, but it never came out in the West. This new release rebuilds Like A Dragon: Ishin from the ground up, and you can check out how great it's looking in the trailer below: 


Like A Dragon: Ishin takes place in the Late Edo Period of Japan, in the 1860s. After completing his special sword training, Sakamoto Ryoma returns to his home in Tosa, only to find conflict against a prestigious samurai. You can read more about it in our story here.
Like A Dragon: Ishin hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on February 21.]]></summary>

Now, RGG has announced Like A Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name, a new Yakuza game that will follow Kiryu's life following the events of Yakuza 6: The Song of Life leading up to Like A Dragon 8. 
In the reveal trailer, which aired today during the RGG Summit 2022 showcase, we see Kiryu at a monastery. Having left behind his former Yakuza life, as well as his name, Kiryu, who now goes by Joryu, is trying to live the life of a monk. However, he's seemingly pulled into one more job – an escort mission – and if today's Like A Dragon 8 trailer is any indication, it seems this final job pulls him back into the life he had put behind him. 
Check it out for yourself in the reveal trailer below:


As you can see, The Man Who Erased His Name is shaping up to be a treat for longtime Yakuza fans and it seems like necessary playing in the leadup to 2024's Like A Dragon 8. Like A Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC in 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The eighth mainline installment in the popular and long-running Yakuza franchise has been revealed and it's called Like A Dragon 8. 
Set up as a direct sequel to 2020's Yakuza: Like A Dragon, which starred a new protagonist, Ichiban Kasuga, and turn-based RPG mechanics rather than brawler combat, it was a hit amongst fans. That's why it's no surprise Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio is following it up with another Like A Dragon game. Check out the Like A Dragon 8 reveal trailer for yourself below:


As you can see, the former protagonist of Yakuza, Kazuma Kiryu, is back. He was the protagonist in the first six Yakuza games, and now he's back in Like A Dragon 8. Ichiban tells Kiryu it's Hero time – remember, he's a big fan of the Dragon Quest series which stars plenty of heroes – before the trailer cuts to both of their faces, revealing that some time has passed, with both characters looking at least a little older than when we last saw them. 
Like A Dragon 8 is due out PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PC sometime in 2024. 
In the meantime, read about Like A Dragon: Ishin, a Yakuza spinoff first released on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 3 in 2014 finally making its way to the West, rebuilt from the ground up, next year.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today brought a doubleheader of platform-holder livestreams. Our day kicked off with a Nintendo Direct, which brought us more than 40 minutes of headlines, gameplay trailers, announcements, and even name reveals. We finished off the day with a PlayStation State of Play, giving us trailers and information for the PlayStation family of consoles, including PlayStation VR2.
Now that the dust has settled a little bit, we want to know what caught your eye. Was it something from Nintendo's digital event? Perhaps the name and release date reveal of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom? Was the impressive list of Nintendo 64 games coming to Switch Online's Expansion Pack? Maybe you're super hyped for Fire Emblem Engage?
Or was it something from the PlayStation State of Play event? Tekken 8 was an expected but exciting reveal, while games like Rise of the Ronin and Like a Dragon: Ishin look like an absolute blast. Of course, we can't talk about the State of Play stream without mentioning that God of War: Ragnarök footage.
Let us know in the comments below what you're most hyped about coming out of today's Nintendo Direct and PlayStation State of Play. If you happened to miss any of the announcements, you can check out our news hub for all our coverage from today.]]></summary>

        <updated>2022-09-13T23:50:09.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony revealed a brand new story trailer for God Of War Ragnarök during today’s State Of Play stream. The video showcased otherworldly imagery, including astral jellyfish, giant dinosaur-like creatures, and notably, a pivotal scene wherein Atreus appears to usher in Fimbulwinter, the end of the world, alongside Sköll and Hati – two wolves that are the offspring of Fenrir. According to Norse mythology, Sköll and Hati are two wolves who exist to one day spark the beginning of Ragnarök by chasing and devouring the sun and the moon. It’s pretty clear that’s what is happening in this new trailer, but why is Atreus helping them?
Additionally, it seems Atreus is hiding critical information from his father, Kratos, so why is Kratos following orders from his teenage son? Why is Freya holding a sword up to Atreus’ throat in the trailer? Is she holding Atreus hostage or trying to show Kratos the same pain she suffered after her son Baldur was killed in the first game? The trailer creates more questions than answers, precisely what I want from pre-launch marketing. 


We’ll have to wait to find the answers to these questions when God Of War Ragnarök releases on November 8. In the meantime, let me know your story theories in the comments below!]]></summary>

It's also referred to as a "console exclusive" for PlayStation, which means it'll probably come to PC.

The game takes place in the Late Edo Period, in the 1860s. After finishing his sword training, Sakamoto Ryoma returns home to Tosa, only to get into a fight with a prestigious and highly ranked samurai. Now, players can change the course of Japan's history in this Yakuza spin-off game.
Like a Dragon: Ishin is set to launch on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC in February 2023.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlayStation and Team Ninja have announced Rise of the Ronin, a new action game coming exclusively to PlayStation 5 sometime in 2024. 
It was revealed during today's PlayStation State of Play, and if you're at all familiar with Team Ninja's other games, you're probably going to be into this one. It's not quite clear if it's taking up the Soulslike mantle that other Team Ninja games have (looking at you, Nioh), but there were a few gameplay sequences that showed some combat similar to From Software's hit series. 
Check it out for yourself in the reveal trailer below: 


As you can see, Rise of the Ronin looks quite interesting. The combat looks fast, brutal, and explosive, and the characters look fun. The world looks especially unique, too, with some of the game seemingly taking place in more rural areas of Japan and others taking place in more dense villages and towns.

Unfortunately, it might be a while before we learn more because Rise of the Ronin won't hit PlayStation 5 until 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bandai Namco has revealed Tekken 8, a new sequel in the popular and long-running fighting game franchise. 
Tekken 8 was revealed in a new cinematic trailer that aired during today's PlayStation State of Play. It began with a few shots to set up the scenery before cutting to two series mainstays, Kazuya and Kazuya's son, Jin. The two duke it out in what appears to be a fair fight, that is until Kazuya calls forth the power of the devil gene inside him to finish the fight. 
Check it out for yourself in the reveal trailer below:


Unfortunately, this trailer doesn't reveal much else. Tekken 8 looks very much like Tekken, which is great. The trailer also doesn't reveal a release date – it just says to stay tuned for more information.

After almost two years of further work by a different developer, the remake of the XIII remake is now live.

Not to be confused with the unrelated Remothered games, it's the tale of a young girl returning home after surgery to find everything is weird and her mother is some sort of eerie mannequin. It might be my favourite horror game of 2021? Now's a good time to raise Mothered because: 1) it finally has a demo for newcomers; 2) for veterans, that demo actually hides a secret expansion continuing the game's story.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As one of the most influential and beloved shooters of all time, GoldenEye 007 is a special game for many who played it in the late '90s. However, it's been a long time since the game has been playable on modern consoles. That changes soon, as the revolutionary first-person shooter received a duo of announcements today. First, we learned about a Switch version as part of the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack N64 catalog. However, we also learned the title (which was developed by now-Microsoft-owned Rare), is also coming to Xbox as a part of Game Pass and Rare Replay.
When the game arrives on Xbox, it will include the classic campaign, complete with the original difficulty settings and cheat codes (no word on if "DK Mode" will be renamed to something more generic like "Big Head Mode" for the Xbox version). The Xbox version will also include the split-screen local competitive multiplayer mode that made the game such a mainstay for get-togethers in the N64 era.


Unfortunately, it does not appear as though the online multiplayer available in the Nintendo Switch Online version will make the jump to the Xbox version. However, the Xbox version of GoldenEye 007 does include improved control options (including dual analog stick support), native 16:9 resolution up to 4K Ultra HD, a consistent refresh rate, and full achievement support. 
GoldenEye 007 is coming to Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One as part of Game Pass. Everyone who already owns Rare Replay will also be able to download the game at no additional cost. We don't know exactly when GoldenEye 007 arrives on Xbox, but according to Rare, the game will land simultaneously on Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch Online.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We're rapidly approaching the midway point for Mario Kart 8 Deluxe's Booster Course Pass content. With two of the six promised waves of new courses already out, Nintendo has begun teasing what players can expect with the third wave, which is due out this holiday season. During today's Nintendo Direct, we learned the first two courses coming in the third eight-course wave of new tracks.
Fittingly, the first course we learned about for Wave 3 of the Booster Course Pass is Merry Mountain. This holiday-themed track first made its debut in Mario Kart Tour in 2020 as part of the Winter Tour. Meanwhile, for those looking for something not holiday-themed, Nintendo is also bringing Peach Gardens, a track that first appeared in Mario Kart DS in 2005.
Wave 1 brought fan favorites like Coconut Mall (Wii), Choco Mountain (N64), and Sky Garden (GBA), while Wave 2 gave us access to tracks like Kalimari Desert (N64), Mario Circuit 3 (SNES), and Mushroom Gorge (Wii). Each wave has also given us two tracks from Mario Kart Tour, with Wave 2 also including an all-new course in Sky-High Sundae. 
Mario Kart 8 Deluxe – Booster Course Pass Wave 3 is scheduled to arrive this holiday season.]]></summary>

The first free update, which came out earlier this summer, added the ability to use the leg strap accessory for entire soccer matches instead of just shootouts. The second, more anticipated free update is set to add a new playable sport to the package: golf. Originally set for release this fall, Nintendo today announced a small delay to the update, saying it now arrives this holiday season.
The Nintendo Switch Sports version of golf lets you tee up across 21 holes carried over from the Wii Sports series. You can play locally with other players or hit the links with up to eight players online in the new Survival Golf mode. In Survival Golf, whoever takes the most strokes each round is eliminated.
This free update to Nintendo Switch Sports arrives this holiday season. For more about Nintendo Switch Sports, you can check out our full review here.]]></summary>

In The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, players can explore the surface of the version of Hyrule they traveled across in Breath of the Wild as well as various floating islands in the sky. In the new trailer, we see Link go from the sky to the surface, then from the surface to the sky.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dauntless developer Phoneix Labs has announced a new title that, needless to say, is dramatically different than its monster-slaying RPG. Fae Farm is a cozy life simulation that whisks players to a world of magic and wonder where you'll flex your green thumb as a farming savior. 


As the name suggests, the bulk of the experience involves running a farm as an adventurer and newcomer to a community in the land of Azoria. Though you’ll work to bring peace to this troubled land, you’ll also kick back and leisurely explore various environments, collect resources, and build homesteads. Fae Farm is built with cooperation in mind. The title features drop-in/drop-out co-op, both locally and online, allowing players to farm and quest together. 
“With Fae Farm we wanted to take our favorite elements of the sim genres we love, infuse them with magic and beautiful art, and wrap everything in a light-hearted cooperative experience,” said creative director Katie De Sousa in a press release. “I can’t wait to see what kind of cozy homesteads players build in Azoria.”
Fae Farm is slated to release during Q2 2023 exclusively for Switch.]]></summary>

        <updated>2022-09-13T14:31:11.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I can't believe I'm writing this: Pikmin 4 is real, and it's out next year. 
Let's get right to it – check out the official Pikmin 4 announcement trailer below: 


Here's what Nintendo had to say about Pikmin 4 in a press release following today's reveal: 
 
Pikmin franchise revealed a tranquil park and a napping Bulborb, but it was still missing one important element … Pikmin! Where could they be? More details about this new title for Nintendo Switch will be revealed ahead of its 2023 launch."

 
Pikmin is a very special franchise to many people, but despite its niche popularity, it's never quite reached the heights of other Nintendo franchises. In total, the franchise has sold more than 8 million copies. Pikmin 3 Deluxe on Switch proved the franchise still had some (fruit) juice in it by selling roughly 2 million units in less than a year – a quarter of the series' entire sales – and fans speculated this had proved to Nintendo that it was time for a proper sequel. 
Pikmin 4 was mentioned by series creator Shigeru Miyamoto back in 2015 when he told Eurogamer that it was in development and "very close to completion." Time passed and then Hey! Pikmin, a 2D Pikmin spinoff, was announced and then released in July of 2017. Some speculated that this was the Pikmin 4 Miyamoto was referring to back in 2015 but in June of that year, Miyamoto told Eurogamer that "it is progressing," seemingly confirming that he did not view Hey! Pikmin as the fourth sequel. Unfortunately, that was the last Nintendo or anyone there referred to Pikmin 4...until today's Nintendo Direct!

Nintendo showcased a short and sweet teaser trailer that gave us more of the luscious world of Pikmin before flashing to a title screen that revealed Pikmin 4 is coming to Switch next year. As for exactly when, that remains unknown  – Nintendo simply stated 2023. But hey, that's better than wondering when, if ever, Pikmin 4 would actually come out!

The soundtrack includes favorites like "One Winged Angel," "Torn from the Heavens," "Suteki Da Ne," and plenty more. With 385 songs included in the base game, Square Enix understands it might be difficult to sort through them all, so it included a way to sort by game. The game can be enjoyed by two players locally or four players online.


Theatrhythm Final Bar Line comes to PlayStation 4 and Switch on February 16. Square Enix also announced that players can look forward to paid DLC from the Saga, Nier, Octopath Traveler, and Live A Live series for a total of 90 additional songs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On November 4, Hazelight and Electronic Arts' It Takes Two launches on Switch. This heartwarming adventure originally released in 2021 on PC and PlayStation and Xbox consoles. It received a 9.25 out of 10 review from Game Informer and also won The Game Awards' 2021's Game of the Year honors.
It Takes Two can only be played cooperatively and can either be played on a single Switch via splitscreen or on two Switches via local wireless or online via the free friend's pass.
In my review of the Xbox One version, I said "It Takes Two may not be the platforming juggernaut that it aspires to be, but it more than makes up for it with its big heart, wealth in variety, and gorgeous imagery. All of its individual actions are things we’ve done in other games, but when applied to this distinct cooperative approach, they take on a whole new life and are used in wonderful ways over a long adventure. The action will have you laughing and screaming at your TV, and the story stays strong throughout, creating the backbone for an entertaining adventure that roars with excitement and should keep you glued to the controller to see if this couple’s lost love can be rekindled."
Preoders for the Switch version begin today.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cyberpunk 2077 is having a bit of a resurgence at the moment. CD Projekt Red's 2077 anime, Cyberpunk: Edgerunners, developed by Studio Trigger and Netflix is out (as of today!) and the Phantom Liberty expansion for the game is due out next year. While Phantom Liberty has been confirmed to be 2077's first and only expansion, it seems CDPR is not yet ready to part with this world. 
During the CD Projekt Group H1 2022 earnings call, CDPR's vice president of business development Michał Nowakowski said the studio is committed to doing more with this IP, as reported by IGN. 


"We decided to develop one major expansion for Cyberpunk, which is going to take advantage of all the capabilities of the new-gen consoles," Nowakowski said during the call. "Having said that, we're totally, fully committed to developing the Cyberpunk IP further, beyond this particular Cyberpunk expansion. We've put a lot of effort and time into building this franchise and we definitely want to continue to build upon what was built right now – with new stories, new experiences, new content, basically. Not just the video game format...in terms of expansions, there's just going to be one major expansion. However, there's going to be new stuff in the future." 
As for what exactly, only time will tell but considering a Cyberpunk 2077 anime is already out, perhaps the studio is looking to dive more into the entertainment medium with this IP. As IGN notes, there's also The Molasses Flood, a Boston-based studio that CDPR acquired earlier this year, which is working on an existing CDPR IP. This could be something related to The Witcher, of course, but perhaps it's something related to 2077. 
In the meantime, read about why now is the right time to play Cyberpunk 2077 and then read about what to expect in next year's Phantom Liberty expansion.

More specifically, Platinum Games will terminate the game's service on February 27, 2023. As for why, the team didn't really outline the reason but it's likely due to the game's poorly received launch and its lack of players since then. Square Enix tried to remedy the game's issues by sending players a survey asking them how the team can improve the game and shortly after, Platinum Games said it has "no plans to reduce the scale of development on Babylon's Fall." It seems things have changed because Babylon's Fall will fall early next year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The next EA Original has been announced, and it’s coming from Koei Tecmo and Omega Force, developers of the Dynasty Warriors series. Set in Japan during its feudal period but with a fantasy twist, EA and Koei Tecmo describe the as-yet-untitled project as “the next great hunting game”. Dispel those mental images of theHunter: Call Of The Wild and Big Buck Hunter though, because it sounds like this is more in the vein of hack-and-slash monster hunting shenanigans.

Unlike the mere low-res images of abandoned Steam Deck designs we’ve already seen, however, these were mostly functional PC gaming machines. That’s according to Valve engineer Pierre-Loup Griffais, who shared a video of an early, more rounded-looking Deck booting to SteamOS and loading up Half-Life 2.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Correctly striking a succession of notes in a rhythm game gives me a huge high, but I'm more familiar with feeling the corresponding low. A succession of missed notes whizzing past sounds like an ode to my failure, and in mashups that mix demanding rhythms with another genre - like Crypt Of The Necrodancer, say - these reminders of my musical inadequacy often drown out even the simplest pleasures. 

Often but not always. Metal: Hellsinger's mix of rhythm game and Doom 2016-style shooter kept me tapping my foot as I battled through hell - even as I failed regularly, and even as someone who doesn't care for metal music.

Now, in addition to that aforementioned Nintendo Direct tomorrow morning, we're now also receiving a PlayStation State of Play stream in the afternoon.
The news comes as Tokyo Game Show looms, giving publishers a massive convention to piggyback off of. According to PlayStation, tomorrow's show will feature updates from some of the company's Japanese partners, as well as surprises from developers all around the world. Tomorrow's presentation is set to last approximately 20 minutes and will feature new updates and gameplay footage from 10 games across PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation VR2.
This PlayStation State of Play stream is set for tomorrow, September 13 at 3 p.m. Pacific/6 p.m. Eastern. You can watch it live on PlayStation's Twitch and YouTube channels. Of course, if you miss the show, we'll have all the biggest announcements covered right here on Game Informer.]]></summary>

Alas, said footage has been crushed down to only a handful of GIFs over on the PlayStation Blog, but our friends at Eurogamer have a bigger, chunkier hands on preview that tells us more about why it won't be mega cringe. Alas, we weren't privy to this Forspoken demo, so have a watch with us below.

Talking to devs especially is a wonderful thing, especially when you're playing their game and it resonates with you. But getting hands-on with an early portion of American Arcadia rendered me virtually silent, to the point where I had to apologise to the devs for being so quiet.
And I wasn't being rude; far from it! I was just so engrossed in the game's mixture of side-scrolling platforming and first-person puzzling. Keep this under surveillance, because I think it's going to be a real hit when it lands.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gloomwood is, so far, a very good game, but it is also not much of a game - in the literal sense that it has launched into early access incomplete. There's currently just enough of it to play that it makes you feel both bereft and quite annoyed when it suddenly clangs its great iron doors shut in front of you. "Let me in!!" you scream, as you hammer on the silent portal. "I really like Thief! I get you! I want to throw more decapitated heads as lures!"
If you are one of those people who bases their gaming personality on liking the original Thief series, Gloomwood will have been on your radar for a while. It's a grimy, steampunk-ish stealth immersive sim with a deliberate low-poly vibe, and it picks up the abandoned Thief football to absolutely run with it. But, though the current EA build is but short, it feels like Gloomwood is aiming to punt that ball into outer space. There's so much more room to be playful and experiment than I expected, and it's so much fun that if you'd never played a stealth sim in your life I'd recommend Gloomwood. Except I wouldn't, because it feels like I'd be doing you a disservice to recommend it now, when the fun will be so quickly snatched away.

I suspect it's probably a similar experience to watching the carnage of Chivalry II play out from the safety of a nearby bench. The newly announced Warlander from Nier Replicant devs Toylogic certainly has the medieval setting in common with Torn Banner Studio's first-person hack and slash, but this free-to-play multiplayer warfare game is an altogether different beast. You control your warriors in third-person, for starters, and its more cartoonish visuals allow for, well, daft cataclysmic events like a flaming meteor shower to hone in on a player's position without appearing completely over the top. As it prepares to enter its first open beta later today, September 12th, I went hands on with a brief demo build to see what it was all about.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["Oh, come on!" is a phrase you hear a lot in Sunday Gold. It's often uttered by your knuckle-dusting healer Sally, and is invariably followed up by, "You havin' a laugh, mate?" and "Facking hell!" - partly because Sally is from Laaaandan and is thus obligated to speak lik' tha', innit (because how else would you know this is a game set in Laaaandan), but also because the thugs, security guards and cybernetic dogs she's often fighting in this seedy tale of corporate dystopia are some of the most frustrating enemies known to video games. The type who are seemingly resistant to every single weapon type in your arsenal, or who invariably have big, scripted healing sequences just when you're about to nail 'em. 
It's a phrase I often found myself echoing while playing Sunday Gold for review, too, both during its tedious, war of attrition-style turn-based battles, and while trying to figure out some of its more obtuse puzzles. BKOM Studios have tried to fuse one too many things together in Sunday Gold, and the result is a messy, somewhat artificial blend of Deathloop's style, Invisible Inc's tension and a more action-led focus on the cerebral role-playing of Disco Elysium. There's still much to admire in its stylish visuals and atmospheric music, but I also haven't been this cross playing a video game since Felix The Reaper, and that's saying something.

Squeenix have teamed with blockchain company Oasys, who describe themselves as “environmentally-friendly”. This is because of their less energy-intensive “proof-of-stake” mechanism compared to “proof-of-work” methods such as those used in Bitcoin mining. Oasys's plans fits with Squeenix’s intention to develop tokenised economies built on blockchain in their future games.

The exception is the Uncharted: Legacy Of Thieves Collection, which was confirmed for PC back in September 2021 but which still hasn't arrived.

It seems like that will change soon. A recent, hastily-removed update to the collection's Epic Games Store page declared that it would release on October 19th.

It's not going to be quite the massive open world adventure 'em up that the last few entries have been (don't worry; one of those is on the way as well), but a more classic AssCreed experience to mark the series' 15th anniversary. This milestone has made me realise that the Creedsperience has taken up almost half of my current lifespan. Or, to put it another way, I fear that playing Assassin's Creed Mirage may induce a pathetic but very real existential crisis in me.

To celebrate the doughty action-adventure's 15th anniversary, senior community developer Alice Terrett was joined by a, to his credit, very excited Danny "it's the Daddy" Wallace, to lay out an almost MCU-like timeline of every Assassin's Creed thing happening for the next good while. It includes new DLC for Valhalla, and a mysterious horror-ish tease. But top of the list, after next year's more trad and compact Assassin's Creed Mirage, is Assassin's Creed: Codename Red, the next big flagship open-world RPG for the series. And it's set in feudal Japan.

Thankfully, VP executive producer on Assassin's Creed Marc-Alexis Côté (aka MAC) appeared on tonight's Ubisoft Forward livestream to explain more about Infinity, and I am slightly less alarmed but no less confused. Rather than a game, MAC says that Infinity is "going to be the single entry point for our fans into the Assassin's Creed franchise in the future".
