        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If ever there was a season for Destiny 2 grenade launchers to shine, then Revenant is it. Liturgy is a kinetic Stasis grenade launcher full of wondrous delights for both PvE and PvP. Here are the rolls to chase and drops to keep an eye out for while channeling your inner Belmont.


How to get Liturgy in Destiny 2


Being a seasonal weapon, there are several dedicated ways to add Liturgy to your collection. Completing The Last City's Onslaught runs drops season-exclusive gear. If you want to add a little variety, you can always consume one of Eido's potions that give a chance to award Liturgy for completing any activity. Finally, claiming rank-up rewards can do the trick. Just make sure to wear the seasonal gear to buff your rep gain rate.

Destiny 2 has always been a leader in how fun it is to run and gun, and the new Red Tape Scout rifle is no different. Here are the rolls to chase during Revenant.


How to get Red Tape in Destiny 2


This Stasis scout rifle can be acquired in a few ways. The first is via the new Revenant-specific Onslaught runs, accessed through The Last City. The second is to pop one of Eido's potions, which gives a chance to award the Revenant weapons after completing any activity. The third and final method is by earning rank-up rewards from Eido herself. Equipping the Revenant seasonal gear expedites this as it buffs rep gain.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Once Human has been through a bit of a rough patch with the recent Prismverse's Clash which had some issues, but a solid Dev Stream and the imminent arrival of The Way of Winter have players excited again. There are various changes coming, but arguably the most exciting of them all (except for the actual new scenario) is the huge change to Mod farming. 


When I switched to Power Surge from Shrapnel I can't tell you how many times I had to defeat the Treant on Pro Mode to get the Mods I needed. I was only after Power Surge Mods, and instead, all I got were Frost Vortex Mods (not all bad, since I'll be using Frost Vortex and Burn next season!). 


Well, never again will we have to grind through getting the wrong mods constantly. Once Update 1.3 arrives, we'll actually be able to choose which type of Mods we want post-battle. The sub-stats (or attributes) will still be random, but at least we'll be able to get the right kind of mods, every time. 


However, you will need to use a Controller to make this choice. 


Other notable changes from the Once Human 1.3 Patch Notes include fixing an issue that was potentially causing server instability and lag, seven new Deviations, five new weapons, two new gear sets (and key gear blueprints), and — of course — a brand new adventure through fire and ice. 


The new scenario in Once Human drops on 17 October (this Thursday!), and is set to take place over 35 days across five phases of increasing survival difficulty. Interesting new mechanics include the cooperative building of thermal towers to keep the bite of winter out, new dungeons, and even a new rift space featuring an enemy only found in Prime Wars before. 


We'll be able to work together as one big server again in this new PvE scenario, which sounds incredibly exciting! 


To read the full patch notes, check out Once Human's official Steam page.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blazin' squad.
A totally original pixel art fighting game in 2024 is certainly a welcome surprise. What’s more of a surprise, though, is discovering that Mark Minkyu Chung touts himself as a solo game developer. Known by his developer handle Rarebreed, we hopped to Blazing Strike’s credits roll to corroborate the seemingly impossible. And, sure enough, he appears to have done pretty much everything himself, from programming to art direction, rollback netcode implementation, and sound. Where he’s had help, he’s still the lead credit of two individuals for things like animation, character, and environment design. To that end, it appears Blazing Strike’s vast majority is indeed the effort of one man - a head-spinning feat considering the comprehensive nature of the end product.
A love letter to the fighting game hardcore, there’s plenty of SNK about Blazing Strike, with incredibly tall, superbly rendered sprites, tons of animation frames, and a scaling effect that zooms in and out based on the proximity of the combatants. Indeed, the game’s graphical style is arguably its most polished asset, and bears some visual kinship to Rage of the Dragons. The spritework appears genuine, as if it was crafted on old-school tools, and boasts a near-CPS3 quality (that being the hardware that fuelled Street Fighter III and Red Earth). The colour palette positively beams, with attractive blending, and, although samey at times, the backgrounds are truly top-notch, featuring a range of sci-fi cityscapes and in-theme prison courtyards.

The show racked up 16 Primetime Emmy Awards nominations and has been commissioned for a second series, which will see the cast head to New Vegas. Showrunners have said they can see Fallout running for five series.


Along with HBO’s The Last Of Us, Fallout TV has shown that it is possible to make appealing and critically acclaimed TV out of existing game franchises.

Remember when we had to wait years for news of a localised Trails game? Those days are almost behind us, as The Legend of Heroes: Trails Through Daybreak II will be launching on Switch on 14th February 2025.
Wow, February is getting pretty packed already, isn't it? Plus, that's just eight months after the previous game in the series, Trails Through Daybreak, which means we'll soon only be one title behind Japan's release schedule.

The series is something I can play with my parents and family. Because Mario Party is 80% luck, 15% cruelty, and 5% skill, winning isn’t a foregone conclusion for me.

French studio La Grange is behind development on this one, and it certainly looks charming while ticking off a lot of the expected indie game features. La Grange and publisher Fireshine Games paired the release date announcement with a new trailer. If you like roguelikes, deck-builders, isometric pixel art visuals, tactics, or all of the above, you might want to give it another peek.




Beyond the tactical battles, there's also an element of settlement development and management in Toads of the Bayou. While you attempt to take down the vile spirit Baron Samedi — who trapped you and your fellow wandering toads in a cursed bayou — you'll have a chance to establish and expand your home base. Everything from an armory to a witch hut can be put to use, introducing new allies and unlocking new abilities and cards for your deck in the process.


As you upgrade your territory, you can set traps for any would-be attackers to get the spring on them. Each of the three main playable toads has different advantages and disadvantages, and they'll have to go up against 10 bosses over the course of the campaign. The concept is on point and the art backs it up beautifully, so I'm ready to hit the swamp and see how well it all works together.

Disney Tron: Catalyst is not that.


I’ll be honest, when he said that, I was hoping for a new FPS. I still have a huge fondness for Monolith Productions 2003, Tron 2.0 – as does Mike Bithell. Disney Tron: Catalyst (the PR person stressed the “Disney” party, but this is the last time I’m including it) isn’t that either, but it is an isometric action game.

When you're playing the game for the first time and completing the Stamp Book, you'll get plenty of this resource.

Thankfully, there's a pretty handy way to get these mythical balls quickly, which will also help you to raise the proficiency level of your characters.

Like every other video game, farming here refers to a systematic and sustainable way of getting a resource (Dragon Balls, in this case). This method doesn't exploit any cheat/bug, and you can keep getting plenty of balls by simply playing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[All is not well at Bandai Namco as the Japanese Studio is reportedly canceling projects involving IPs related to Naruto and One Piece licenses amidst layoffs.


The reports of cancelations come right after the global success of Dragon Ball Sparking Zero, which has managed to meet fan expectations. Unfortunately, the same can't be said about several other games, some of which might have been under development. As reported by Bloomberg, the Japanese studio is also facing a wave of fresh "layoffs," and over 100 people might have already resigned.


Bandai Namco's layoffs are taking place in typical Japanese fashion


Unlike corporations in the West, Japanese organizations have a different way of letting go of workers. More than 200 workers have been reportedly sent to rooms where they have nothing to work on. The idea is to force them to leave voluntarily, and over 100 people have already resigned.


Incidentally, a spokesperson for Bandai Namco has refused the existence of such a practice while speaking to Bloomberg.



Some employees may need to wait a certain amount of time before they are assigned their next project, but we do move forward with assignments as new projects emerge. There is no organization like an ‘oidashi beya’ at Bandai Namco Studios designed to pressure people to leave voluntarily.”




As for the projects, the cancelations have been done based on "comprehensive assessments" of the situations. 



 “Our decisions to discontinue games are based on comprehensive assessments of the situation."




The fresh news will be disappointing for those who specifically love anime-based titles. Any positive momentum gained after the successful launch of Dragon Ball Sparking Zero might now be lost entirely. It will be interesting to see if there will be a new game featuring Naruto or One Piece licenses in the near future.

We had a sublime time with Castlevania Dominus Collection when it shadow-dropped onto Switch back in August and now Konami has released a new patch to make things that bit better.
The latest update is a small one, we'll admit, but there are some nice tweaks here all the same. The most notable addition this time around is a new helping of Order of Ecclesia artwork in the Gallery Mode, though the ver. 1.0.1 patch also reproduces some of Portrait of Ruin's minor glitches (for some OG exploits) and fixes a bug in Dawn of Sorrow.

Listen! Nintendo has been doing a smashing job recently, in going back to some of its long-running franchises, stuff like Metroid and Pikmin, to bring us new entries that lean into the core strengths of what made us love them in the first place, instead of just continuing to bloat them with fluff and distractions.
With Pikmin 4 especially, we saw how that series was refocused around the actual puzzling and exploration, pulling back from the often scripted events of 3 to re-engage players on a more satisfying level. In the same way, Metroid Dread felt like a stripped-back return to the roots of that franchise, one which also very carefully modernised and updated things, so as not to meddle with the magic that makes us dig it in the first place.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are a lot of new puzzles and riddles in Nightingale that need to be completed in order to progress. Some of these puzzles are harder than others to figure out, and one of the trickiest ones involves Taliesin. 


Upon entering an Astrolabe Forest Realm, you’ll be able to find Taliesin nearby, and he’ll ask you to unravel five riddles. To do this, you have two options. Well, three, if you count brute forcing your way through the answers as many have done previously. 


Option 1: Search the length and breadth of the realm for the five poems and then decipher them, running the risk of making an incorrect guess and getting cursed.


Option 2: Keep reading, because we’ve got all the answers right here.

Abubakar Salim, actor and director for the 2024 metroidvania Tales of Kenzera: ZAU, has recently slammed publishers' desire to create "the next Fortnite".
In speaking with Dexerto, Salim commented on the state of the games industry at the moment and his desire for companies to start promoting games as an art form rather than a means of simply generating more money.

Or at least, a proper list of known bugs on day one, to preempt any compilations created by vengeful players? Skyrim Lead Designer and Starfield Systems Designer Bruce Nesmith has spoken a little about the “interesting problem” of how open developers should be about technical issues on day one, given the expectation some players have that every game should be "flawless".
When asked by Videogamer if lists of known bugs (Nesmith throws out ‘700’ as an example for Skyrim) should be shared with fans on launch "to temper expectations," he responded:

Slowly, and with great difficulty, the developer Starbreeze managed to make it to the first anniversary on a positive note. Now, studio heads look back and discuss the state of the game on day one.


In a recent interview with PCGamesN, Payday 3's community lead Almir Listo and lead producer Andreas Penninger explained what happened early on. "Our energy was like ‘we’re a rock band, and we’re coming onto the stage, and we’ve got a new album.’ And the whole stage just collapsed and everyone left," said Penninger. "When you have a launch like we did – a disastrous launch, where nobody is able to play the game – there is no place to hide.

Months!” his mate had told him. Get less shit mates, thought I, for I had already played it elsewhere, and knew that the missions took mere minutes if you put the game on easy then rushed your objectives, bonking nazis along the way. I did not rush the new Steam demo for Kalypso’s revival, Commandos: Origins, but it’s still doable inside half an hour. I had expected a little more, but what’s here has certainly given me some optimism that the full game might well be worth sinking - if not months - at least more time than it takes to wildly lunge at a few nazis en route to your objective.

While obtaining pre-war nuclear launch codes was a privilege only a few in the world had, the post-apocalyptic wasteland hands out codes as if they were phone numbers. If you're looking to leave a radioactive scar upon Earth yourself, you're gonna need to know what Nuke Codes are currently active.


Currently active Fallout 76 Nuke Codes:




Alpha: 
083 22 063




Bravo: 
530 88 112




Charlie: 
320 58 791




Nuke Codes reset every Sunday at 5pm PT / 8pm ET / Monday 12am UTC



What are Nukes Codes used for in Fallout 76?

Now, do you see a horrendous first-person shooter anywhere back there, full of memes and intentionally terrible font choices? Congratulations, you may have remembered 420BlazeIt, a freakish eyesore of a game developed during a 7-day game jam by one of the people behind Crossy Road, of all things. It briefly did the YouTuber rounds, back when YouTube was not yet the anxiety-inducing ad factory it is today. 
Now I'm going to ask you to come back to the present. But prepare for a bit of a shock - there's a sequel coming to that bong huffing shooter. 420BlazeIt 2 has been announced for some months, but now there's a demo you can play too.

To coincide with the delay announcement they've released a new trailer, below, which talks us through the business of foraging on passing planets. It looks engrossing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Press 'X' to Neva.
In the first of couple years of the Switch, one of the standout indie games was an artsy little platformer called GRIS, which combined simple gameplay with incredible visuals to make for a memorable and touching experience. It feels fitting, then, that developer Nomada Studio has managed to produce and release a spiritual successor called Neva in the twilight of the Switch’s lifespan, bookending its time in the spotlight with another artistic experience that very much carries on the essence of Gris and expands upon it in some notable ways. Though it won’t last you terribly long, Neva is a memorable, emotional, and beautiful adventure that we’d suggest you pick up as soon as you can.
The game follows the story of a lone swordswoman named Alba and her titular wolf companion, Neva. Their journey begins when the wolf is just a pup with the two of them and Neva’s mother exploring a beautiful landscape, only for the group to be accosted by a furious storm of shadow demons. They bravely hold their own, but the mother is killed in the onslaught. Mourning the loss, Alba and Neva make it out relatively unscathed, and the two then set out on a long journey to fight back against the encroaching corruption that the shadow demons bring to the land.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Neva is the Sophomore effort from Nomada Studio, who you may remember from their beautiful, dreamy platformer Gris. Neva is not a literal sequel to Gris, but it certainly seems to be one in a spiritual sense, as it, too, is a floaty hand-illustrated platformer fond of metaphor. Neva introduces some drama, with combat and a health system (if not actual stakes because of near-instant restarts), and although neither the platforming nor combat are precise enough to be neat bedfellows, I think we should be willing to forgive most of the mess.

They worked well together, so started looking for their next project - something full-time that could take the place of the increasing instability of freelancing.
It was a shared passion away from videogames that ended up moulding the shape that project would take. "We love tabletop RPGs," says designer and programmer Sacchetti.

Get your pinches of salt at the ready, folks, because it's time for more Nintendo rumour discussion.
In a break from usual proceedings, this one isn't about 'Switch 2' (at least, not entirely). Instead, the latest speculation is focused on the GameCube controller and how it might, might, be making a comeback.

Or maybe not. Lonely Mountains: Snow Riders is the frosty followup to the mountain biking original, Lonely Mountains: Downhill, and like its predecessor it's about going fast while barely able to see what's coming. Yet also like its predecessor, initial frustrations melted away until I was eagerly hitting the slopes in the Snow Riders demo for just one more quick go.

Cosy experiences where nothing goes wrong and you have absolutely zero things to investigate and no otherworldly mysteries to worry about. It may shock you to learn that we were recently duped by "normal" gardening sim Grunn, which was not normal at all. But don't worry, it won't happen again. Today we bring you the ordinary and not-one-bit-suspicious Trip, which sees players wandering from carriage to carriage, chatting pleasantly with passengers during a long train journey. How long? Let me look at the timetable here, let's see... "Forever," it says. Hm. Must be a misprint.

This question has plagued the games industry since Nintendo first allowed millions of unsupervised children to play god with Mii avatars and their customisable peepers. In low-stakes fishing game Webfishing, you can give your fuzzy avatar one of 33 styles of eye (I counted). This is the mark of a solid Animal Crossing-like. There's a lot of other character creation bits and bobs, of course, but you'll have to catch a bunch of bass and sell the haul to unlock every boopable nose and bleppy smile.

In Nahantu’s jungles, I linger to take shots of vines spilling from verdigris-kissed cages, of footfall-slicked stone paths and mesoamerican mosaics. Even Vessel Of Hatred’s malignancy feels like a grimly gorgeous tourist trap. Trip Advisor-recommended cyclopean polyps. TikTok viral demonic cysts. I’ve even got a leopard cub to pose with. He’s not sedated, promise. He’s just like that. I told him how much the ultimate edition costs and he’s been catatonic ever since.
I’d like to stick around, but I keep getting ushered along to the next leg of the tour. There are mobs to pop into goo like ripe spots, each fight as slick and frictionless as a pygmy hippo in a butter bath. There are a dozen different tiered resources and event types designed to make repetition feel like progress, until hell freezes over then melts again. It’s fine, Blizzard packed me some wellies. It’s all so comfortable I suspect they’d have thrown in some Xanax and a back rub if they could.

Say hello to ExeKiller, which I am filing under "not new, but news to me". I know, "ExeKiller" sounds like a computer virus, though I think the people who make viruses tend to favour less obviously nefarious names, like "Microsoft Werd". Hang on, that's what I'm writing this article with! Quickly, before I lose this PC to ransomware: ExeKiller is actually a "semi-open" world cyber-Western FPS with retro futurist visuals. It casts you as a bounty hunter plying the dunes and gas stations of a post-apocalyptic Earth, and it looks like a mix of Cyberpunk 2077 and Drive. Here's some pre-alpha footage.

I was very close to buying the recent remake, actually, until I watched the extended prank scene online and realized, oh no, they’re taking themselves seriously now. They prestige-ified it. It insisted upon itself, Louis, so I didn’t bother. I still wouldn’t say no to a sequel though, and based on a couple of (admittedly vague) hints from two of the game’s actors, one might already be in the works.

"It does something to my brain that I've never experienced before." The developer's just-announced Keep Driving seems a lot less inclined to scramble your grey matter, though it's partial to the old rose-tinted goggles. It's a droll, backward-glancing and slightly ominous 2D management RPG in which you drive to a music festival on the other side of the country. Along the way, you will pick up hitchhikers, upgrade your car, fill your boot with random junk, and participate in turn-based, non-lethal "combat" with dawdling children and obstinate tractors. Here's a trailer.

That game is Konafa Game's Starless Abyss - a roguelite tactical deckbuilder published by Descenders and Yes, Your Grace outfit No More Robots. It puts you in command of a fleet of upgradeable spaceships, who must chase away invading Eldritch aliens hex by hex... and also, hex by hex. This is both hex-based and a game in which you can cast hexes, you see. Oh, don't look at me like that. I had to distil several manifestos into an article half-an-hour ago. I need this.

The press release for this particular Disco Elysiulike has the most actual names on it of the three we've learned about this week. It is also, by some distance, the most outwardly socialist of the lot. It accompanies a website, featuring some blood-red all-caps political manifestos and a fairly exhaustive breakdown of Summer Eternal's workers cooperative structure. Amongst other things, the studio will let people who buy their games form a non-profit within Summer Eternal that gets a share of the revenue, and has a say on company direction.

Yes, this RPG has style for days, maybe even an entire calendar, and an upside of its more dated aspects is that it runs fine on the modest internals of the Steam Deck.

Stablemate Europa Universalis 4 has 37 DLC packs under its banner, while Cities Skylines is streets ahead with a whopping 62. Paradox Interactive have long built their core game business around putative forever-projects that trail an enormous mantle of paid expansions.

They are bickering about whose game is the true spiritual successor to the rockbottom detective RPG. Is it the unnamed project announced earlier today by new studio Longdue, involving some kind of "psychogeography mechanic"? Or is it this one, XXX Nightshift, a cerebral sci-fi RPG set in a posh polar hotel about a detective "solving gruesome murders, breaking sacred hearts, or just killing bloody time"? It's not for me to choose the dialogue option now appearing in your own brain. But I will say this: at least the one with the horny name has a trailer.

I’ll move on from his large majesty for a moment though, because it isn’t the only thing this one looks to have going for it. 
It’s a single player action RPG, to start with - a genre I’m always interested in watching evolve in ways not tied to its usual form as a good-boy-points-vomiting loot casino. It’s also based on Slavic folklore, something that’s not too uncommon but strikes a wonderful mix between blackly funny whimsy and intense dread when done right. Also, I’ll take more discordant folk music any time. Trailer below.

When I first laid eyes on Secret Door's Sunderfolk, while lurking to the rear of a gaggle of journomancers at a preview event last week, I let out an ostentatious sigh. Fortunately, I still mask up to preview events, and am thus free to adopt all kinds of snotty facial expressions without being set upon by burly PRs and shoved into the minifridge for later disposal.

If you're allergic to vulnerability, or find cuteness or the "wholesome" games trend hard to digest, you've probably already turned your face away. But if your heart is open, even a smidge, if you carry a deep craving to peer through the cracks in the internet to discover a small realm of common humanity, then Kind Words 2 can show you a glimpse of that warm and welcoming world.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Paradox Interactive delayed jail management simulator Prison Architect 2 indefinitely this August, commenting at the time that the game had notable performance issues, and that its system-led design was proving tricky to tinker with. This came a couple of months after the Crusader Kings publisher washed their hands of the sequel's original developers, Double Eleven.
Speaking to me at Paradox's Media Day last week, deputy chief executive officer Mattias Lilja offered a shade more insight on the decision, suggesting that hard-up players have "higher expectations" at present and are less trusting that developers will fix problems. Chief creative officer Henrik Fåhraeus also offered thoughts on what Paradox have learned from the disastrous launch of Cities: Skylines 2 in late 2023. Specifically, he said they need to give actual players access to the game early on, not just testers.

As spotted by PC Gamer, some garbled lines the player hears upon first picking up the game’s radio weren’t quite garbled enough in the Italian subtitles, accidentally dropping a massive plot spoiler in the first half hour. Stop reading now if you’re still playing, obviously. Here’s a video of a cat that sounds like he’s saying “bongiorno” you can watch instead.

Dotcom's response to his followers on X was simple: "I'm not leaving." Another post mid-September - "we are very close to disaster" - led to Dotcom disappearing for three weeks. On his return, Dotcom said X had suspended his account, based on an extremely serious allegation. After accusing Elon Musk of failing to help, yesterday Dotcom warned that a Trump loss would see Musk indicted and "fighting for his life." Dotcom has a plan to avoid extradition; chaos like this provides the fuel.

Now in development at The Chinese Room, it'll be an action-RPG with a relatively linear story set in the World Of Darkness universe. This obviously plays to The Chinese Room's strengths - they're better known for melancholy or horrifying strolls through broken spaces than the Dishonorable massaging of intricate systems. But it also reflects Paradox's view that the original Bloodlines has been "mythologised" a bit: people love the memory of it more than the reality, and there are aspects of the 2004 game, according to Paradox's deputy chief executive officer Mattias Lilja, that simply "wouldn't fly today".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s easy to think of your PC’s RAM as something that just needs to be enough, rather than a powerhouse like the graphics card or CPU. Easy for me, anyway, until testing out the Silent Hill 2 remake this past week served up a reality check: modern games need a lot of memory, and in SH2’s case, might not even get past the Steam launcher if they decide you’re lacking in it. As penance, I’ve found some DDR5 RAM deals in the Prime Big Deal Days sales that should set any modern rig for years and years of... well, games launching properly, I suppose.
As such, while 16GB is the bare minimum you can get away with, I’d recommend 32GB to be safe. For pure value, check out Crucial’s DDR5 Pro set, which I've been using in my own testing setup for a while: it’s down from £140 to £80 on Amazon UK, and down from $150 to $81 on Amazon US. But the single best deal here, I reckon, is Corsair’s Vengeance RGB kit, which the US site has slashed from $130 to $100. That’s the same price as the non-RGB equivalent kit while also being faster, at 6400MHz to 6000MHz. Us UK folk can also get a similar set for £101, down from £147, though that’s set at 6000MHz.

The biggest takeaway: the fact pirate Yakuza was, at one point, going to be a fishing game called Like A Dragon: Tuna.

As such, it usually costs a bundle, but with Prime Big Deal Days administering some cuts, it’s going cheaper right now. A lot cheaper: on Amazon UK, it’s down to £110, a full 50% off the RRP. Amazon US, meanwhile, has it down from $230 to $130.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few months ago, Broken Sword creator Charles Cecil walked out of the office of Revolution Software and onto the Shambles, the Diagon Alley-esque street that has survived since York’s days as a medieval trade hub. He closed the door behind him, somewhat grumpily - he’d had to work late, and it was already past eight o’clock. Then a voice piped up behind him.
"And one day, when you get older, you will play Broken Sword," said a young woman to her toddler. "This is where Revolution are based."
Cecil had stumbled across an annual pilgrimage to the site where British point-and-click adventures are made. From the sounds of it, this young woman was not alone in making the journey. Cecil registered Revolution’s office address on Google a year ago - and received an email to say that 40,000 people have checked it out since.
"We’re incredibly blessed to have a really positive and lovely collection of people who want us to succeed and love the games that we write," Cecil says. "We love our interaction with them."
These might read like the words of a good community manager, rather than a man expressing a deeply-held sentiment. Yet Cecil does not take his relationship with Revolution’s fans for granted. At times in his long career, he has lost touch with his audience. And at others, he’s feared they might turn their back on him.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For the record, I still think it’s easier and safer to go with a microSD for your Steam Deck storage needs, and with good Prime Big Deal Days savings on two of the best – the Samsung Pro Plus and the SanDisk Ultra – that opinion remains unbudged. Still, you know what they say: when you’re holding a tiny screwdriver, everything starts to look like a tiny screw. So I understand if the call to replace the Deck’s internal SSD, or indeed that of your Asus ROG Ally, proves too strong.
In which case, have a look at the Crucial P310, which I added to our best SSDs list just last week, and is currently joining in the Prime sale frivolities. Specifically, the 1TB model has been slashed from £128 to £70 on Amazon UK, while it’s the 2TB version that gets a US discount, dropping from $265 to $168.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The obvious way of bundling up Beautiful Light is probably "Hunt Showdown meets S.T.A.L.K.E.R.", and whoops, I've already committed to that in the headline. But the first game that came to mind when I chanced on some playtest footage last night was The Town Of Light, LKA's deeply disquieting game about exploring a carefully recreated abandoned asylum.
There's the title overlap, of course - it's always a bit of a provocation when horror games make a point of being well-lit. Beyond that, the two games share an interest in dessicated interiors where chairs huddle disconsolately, where the sun slides through windows whose curtains have rotted away, and the plaster flakes in ways both pretty and macabre. But where The Town Of Light gave you one rambling building's worth of encroaching hallucinations, Beautiful Light gives you a whole wilderness, where the architecture scales from "dreary forgotten school" to "gleaming underground base". It also gives you a lot of guns. Devised by Geneva-based Deep Worlds SA, this is a team extraction shooter where six squads of three gasmasked alpha-bravos compete to retrieve an artifact from a quarantine zone full of deadly anomalies.

The colourful game about a troubled arena fighter retiring into a life of lapsang souchong and repressed urges to do sudden violence had previously been planned for a release some time in 2024, according to the developer's original announcement. But game development is, as ever, a fickle destroyer of plans.  "Reading the tea leaves, it has become clear that Wanderstop needs a tiny bit more time to fully bloom," they said in a Steam post yesterday, adding that their new estimate is "early 2025".

And if space is the sole concern, it’s hard to get more substantial than the 1.5TB SanDisk Ultra. Never mind how the header pic shows a 64GB card, the much more desirable 1.5TB version is down from £149 to £100 on Amazon UK and from $150 to $89 on Amazon US. Both of those are very fine bargains indeed, for a card that dwarfs even the biggest SSD options of the Steam Deck and Asus ROG Ally families.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This latest Amazon Prime Big Deal Days really is playing all the hits for PC storage. As well as money off the finest Steam Deck microSD, there are savings to be had on our tip-top desktop SSD pick, the WD Black SN850X – which is a few years old now, but still produces superlative gaming load times. Or a lack thereof. The 1TB model is down to £70 at Amazon UK, but I think the Yanks have us beat here, as they can nab the 2TB edition for just $140.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Paradox Interactive have not had a rosy couple of years. While the company's core business in grand strategy remains prosperous, their approach to games outside this niche has been mired by delays, cancelations, closures and layoffs. Let's run through the big setbacks: The Lamplighters League, which we overall liked, was a $22 million financial flop - Paradox have now parted ways with creators Harebrained Studios. Cities Skylines 2 should have been a victory lap, after the success of the first game, but it launched with severe bugs and performance issues. Prison Architect 2, another follow-up to a hit game, has been delayed indefinitely, and Paradox have split from developers Double Eleven. Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 is borderline vapourware: originally announced in 2019 with Hardsuit Labs at the helm, it's currently in the hands of The Chinese Room, and was recently delayed for the umpteenth time into 2025.
And then there's the abrupt cancellation of Life By You, a life management sim designed to compete directly with The Sims 4, and the closure of its creators Paradox Tectonic. Writing-down the development of Life By You cost Paradox around 208 million krona, or $19.2 million. It was the primary contributor to a 90% decrease in the company's operating profit for the second quarter of 2024, versus the same quarter in 2023.

Now, the Amazon Prime Big Deal Days sale has a twin-fan Asus model down to £340 in the UK – the lowest this particular graphics card has ever been, and as far as I can tell, the least you’d have to pay for a brand-new RTX 4060 Ti in the current market.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[No game protagonist is more willing to stick his hand down a toilet than James Sunderland. Why is he doing this? You would have to ask him or the psychiatrist he badly requires. And it's unlikely he'd explain himself. This isn't the type of story in which the protagonist has difficulty accepting the existence of horrors, nor struggles with the surreality of what he needs to do to get through a locked door. In the opening minutes, James finds a well with a glowing red square floating inside, stares into it (it saves your game), then makes a calm remark about the odd sensation he feels, and moves on. The human corpses that pepper the town of Silent Hill are noticeably that of James himself, his head bludgeoned and bloodied beyond recognition but his jacket and boots unmistakable. He makes no remark on this. It's probably nothing.

To celebrate the occasion, Halo Studios have released some footage of Project Foundry, an expansive Unreal Engine 5 prototype and spawning vat for actual Halo games, which is billed by the Xbox Newswire as a kind of ur-Halo - "a true reflection of what would be required for a new Halo game using Unreal, and a training tool for how to get there".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Graham asked me if I'd discovered what the metaphor in Metaphor: ReFantazio might be, and I replied, "I don't know haha", or something along those lines. Having given it more thought, I think there are two metaphors: 1) It plays quite like Persona. 2) Its story is like a commentary on our society… or something to that effect.
Metaphors aside, though, the game is a gigantic fantasy RPG that's technically better than Persona 5 in a lot of ways. Structurally, it feels less repetitive. It has more animated cutscenes that elevate those key story moments. You can brush aside weaker enemies in real-time combat, rather than face them in tiresome turn-based tangoes. And overall, I think it's the best game Persona or Persona-like Atlus have put out - it really is brilliant. But there's a part of me that feels like it's missing something that'll leave it less ingrained in the memory than Persona 5 once its final chapter has closed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There’s a genre of lesser fun that only makes itself known to me once I’ve completely given up on enjoying a game in any traditional sense, lurking under the surface like a silly icon on a losing scratchcard. I’ll call it ‘system tourism’ in lieu of something better. It’s not like the actually fulfilling virtual tourism you might do in something like Yakuza’s Kamurocho, where you’re scarfing down deep fried whiskeys, entranced by the lights. It’s more like doing a Google street view tour of Venice’s canals to see if you can spot someone taking a leak off the side of a gondola - hunting for anarchic anomalies because, honestly, the sights just aren’t grabbing you.
At the risk of sounding like some sort of horrible joy-mathematician: My experience with open world zombie survival game Dread Dawn involved precisely two and half discrete instances of fun, plus some additional appreciation for a few genuinely good ambient bits I’ll get into shortly. With a significant overhaul of basically every player interaction Dread Dawn offers - from the abysmally tedious looting to the rusty combat -  it might some day be worth your time. It harbours some incredible ambition, though it’s surrounded by murk and detritus, like a dictatorial rat in a toilet bowl. Mostly, though, I can only give you advance warning to avoid it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My default movement mode in horror games that actually scare me is: meandering. I seek to approach without approaching, scooting back and forth across the path like a stray hamster, worrying at the corners and avoiding clear perspectives of the route ahead, while keeping the route behind me in my peripheral vision. I have been trained to do this especially by Amnesia, where tilting your gaze too decisively at anything nasty drives your character nuts.
Lurks Within Walls has no time for my hamstery antics. Developed by Here Be Monsters, it's a grid- and turn-based first-person dungeon crawler - a long-lost cousin of Etrian Odyssey that has wound up in an asylum jammed with internet cryptids, reminiscent in cinematic texture of F.E.A.R. In keeping with other grid-based dungeon crawlers, it only lets you turn the view by 90 degree angles and travel in straight lines. Going by the demo, it's a promising restraint for a horror game, though they really do need to expand on the combat, which is currently a slight waste of some terrific creature art.

It’s a point-and-click that calls back to early 90’s Lucas Arts adventure games, and while it shares the same frustrations, the presentation makes it feel entirely contemporary. What begins as a standard detective game - chatting to strangers, rummaging through junk, finding addresses found on the net - soon spirals into something else entirely. I’ve finished it twice and I’m still not sure I totally understand what it all means.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Epic Games laid off over 800 people a year ago, following what CEO Tim Sweeney confessed was an "unrealistic" period of investment designed to "grow Fortnite as a metaverse-inspired ecosystem for creators". Now, it's time to start talking about brighter, metaversal tomorrows and hopefully, not do the whole thing all over again. Epic have detailed early plans for Unreal Engine 6, which Sweeney says will combine Unreal Engine with Fortnite's easy-to-use Unreal Editor to create a gigantic, "interoperable" metaverse platform that lets developers sell stuff that can seamlessly be transferred to other games, whether they run on Unreal Engine or not. Stealth blockchain post? Genuinely, I can neither confirm nor deny.

Last week we had a critical mass of people being off sick, away on trips, away on holiday, or locked in the cellar reviewing very long video games. As such, the flow of news to the dark god of video games journalism was sluggish. Thankfully, the Maw seems to have let us off lightly. It could have risen kraken-like from the abyss and swallowed the planet. Instead, it has merely summoned an extra moon. Quickly now, let's run through the week's PC game releases of note and top the Maw up before that bonus satellite does anything unconventional, like growing teeth.

It's a burden that only benefits rightsholders, but the ISPs are expected to cover their own costs. That contribution was insulted this week by a legal amendment that threatens ISPs with prison for failing to report piracy to the authorities. Google describes it as a requirement to flood the judiciary to avoid prison.  ISPs speak of betrayal; it doesn't get any worse than that.

Better still, on October 14th, it's getting a singleplayer demo as part of the Steam Next Fest.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Backyard Basketball, is finally ready to come off the bench for some sweet public testing! You can now play again on ScummVM this beloved Backyard Sports title (not to mention the last unsupported game on the SCUMM engine). Play with the Backyard Kids and even create five of your own! This game also features (now former) NBA and WNBA stars Kevin Garnett and Lisa Leslie!
Much like the other sports titles of this franchise, controls are point-and-click by default, with gamepad and keyboard options. Pick your favorite kids and play some 3 on 3 basketball. Don't forget your 110% Juice or Dunking Donut for a slamma jamma! Pass that ball in, listen to the live commentary from Sunny Day and Barry DeJay and shoot some jumpers on your way to a championship.
Are you ready to play? Dig up your good old CD and fire up the latest daily build!
