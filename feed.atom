        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, you’ve got your free Natlan 4-star character. Congrats! Kachina is a Geo character in Genshin Impact who is incredibly helpful for exploring Natlan. Here’s how to play Genshin Impact's Kachina, both for overworld traversal and in combat.


How to ride in Kachina’s drill


Kachina’s Skill summons a little drill car called Turbo Twirly. Simply tapping the Skill button summons it as a separate entity. Kachina can then swap to other characters, leaving Turbo Twirly to deal AoE Geo damage periodically.


If you want to keep Kachina on-field, hold the Skill button to summon Turbo Twirly and hop inside. You can then ride around using normal directional inputs. Running into a wall will cause Turbo Twirly to latch on and start climbing. This is a great way to scale large vertical surfaces while…]]></summary>

Mualani’s best weapons


Mualani’s best weapon is her signature 5-star Surf’s Up. It gives her a good amount of CRIT DMG and HP, as well as a buff to her Normal Attacks. It is a 5-star weapon, though, so you’ll have to rely on the gacha system to obtain it. If you happen to have A Thousand Floating Dreams or Tome of the Eternal Flow, those are good 5-star options too, though not as strong as Surf’s Up.

Is Mualani worth pulling?


Mualani is available in the character event banner for the first half of Version 5.0. She’s the first character in Genshin Impact who can truly take advantage of the Vaporize reaction with a Hydro trigger. With the proper Pyro teammates, Mualani is incredibly strong. If you do decide to pull for Mualani, then you won’t be disappointed by her damage.


In terms of raw damage, Mualani in a Vaporize team is roughly on par with Neuvillette in a mono Hydro Furina team. Neuvillette is still unique for his ability to su…]]></summary>

Mualani’s kit and Nightsoul explained


Nightsoul Blessing is the state that Mualani enters when you use her Skill. When Mualani is riding her shark, she is in her Nightsoul Blessing state. In this state, Mualani will continuously consume points and drain the meter to her left. The meter is a handy way of visualizing how much time Mualani can spend in her Nightsoul Blessing state.


You’ll see three fish icons next to the meter, too. These icons represent Wave Momentum stacks, which increase the damage of Mualani’s next Normal Attack. Ideally, all three fish icons sho…]]></summary>

Each form has its strengths, and they gel together well, especially when you have the rarest Add-Ons and Perks to make for a formidable foe you definitely don't want to come up against as a Survivor.

Capcom Fighting Collection, we're learning of a very peculiar piece of news regarding the latter. One of the most mismatched characters to ever duke it out with Marvel superheroes is retaining his roster spot.


Although fans had speculated that Norimaro, a playable character only seen in the Japanese version of Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter, would not be present in the re-release, that's not the case. We just learned that Norimaro is both making a return to the Japanese version and having his debut in the international one. Don't worry if you don't know why that's surprising; Norimaro's confusing origin, and mysterious life story, only adds to his charm.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[German giants Bayern Munich will be one of the most formidable teams in EA FC 25 if the rumored overall ratings of players are to be believed.


I think it's safe to say that Bayern was going to have a strong lineup. It has some of the best talents in football, and the club has increased its strength with a couple of new signings in the transfer window. If the rumors posted by FC content specialist @ Donk are to be believed, here's what the first team could look like inside the game.


Disclaimer: The overall ratings in this article are still unofficial as of writing.


Complete list of Bayern Munich player ratings in EA FC 25 (rumored)


Bayern had a decent season in Europe where they reached deep into the knockouts. Sadly, their league campaign came up short against a remarkable Bayer Leverkusen team who finished their campaign unbeaten. Most of the rumored overall ratings are along the lines of the numbers of EA FC 24 (again, expected).



Harry Kane 90


Jamal Musiala 87


Manuel Neuer 86


Joshua Kimmich 86


Joao Palhinha 85


Leroy Sane 85


Kingsley Coman 84


Kim Min Jae 83


Konrad Laimer 83


Leon Goretzka 83


Alphonso Davies 82


Serge Gnabry 82


Thomas Muller 82


Rafa Guerreiro 82


Dayot Upamecano 82


Michael Olise 82


Eric Dier 80


Mathys Tel 79


Sacha Boey 79


Ito 79


Mathys Tel 77


Sven Ulreich 74



Most of the Bayern footballers have remained stuck with similar numbers from last year. There are a couple of downgrades, with Neuer and Kimmich being at the receiving ends. Youngster Jamal Musiala's rumored rating hints at a potential upgrade, while Harry Kane will likely retain the same rating he has in EA FC 24.

Medicine crafting is unlocked in Chapter Two of Black Myth: Wukong. But unlike many abilities you gain in the game, there is a possibility to miss it. You have to speak with someone in the arid landscape that comprises the game's second chapter. If you don't, well, I'm not sure if you can unlock medicine later down the line.

And we're slowly approaching the end of the console's life cycle, with constant reminders of "Yes, the Switch successor is coming, but we're not talking about it today."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[An Operator's showcase allows you to display your triumphant achievements with one-of-a-kind Calling Cards and Emblems. Unlike most Call of Duty features, this mechanic is a hidden gem in the various settings. So, if you're not sure where to find it, we'll guide you on how to edit a showcase in Modern Warfare 3.


How do you edit your showcase in MW3?


To find the 'Edit Showcase' feature in MW3, open the settings section at the top right corner of the CoD Hub.


Screenshot by Destructoid


Head to the tab with the emblem, next to Settings, where you'll find the option to personalize your showcase. Once open, you can tailor the display of your Operator, Weapon, Calling Card, Emblem, and Clan Tag to your liking.


Screenshot by Destructoid


Not all content will be available, as some skins and cosmetics require a purchase or completed objective. For example, you must earn enough Operator Kills or win matches to earn the seasonal Prestige Mastery Cards.


Display up to three Calling Cards in the showcase to cover your favorite achievements. However, once they are placed down, these cards cannot be manually removed from the slots. The only way to get rid of them is by swapping it out with another available Calling Card.


You can further tweak your Operator display via the Customize tab. You'll find this hub in MW3 Zombies or Multiplayer, providing access to purchased bundles, vehicles, loading screens, and music. Calling Cards, Emblems, and Clan Tags can also be personalized here for quick and easy access.


Once you've edited your showcase in Modern Warfare 3, your profile becomes a sight to behold for other players. You can reciprocate the admiration by checking out your friend's list or any other Operators that you come across.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On occasion, WoW has some of the most infuriating quests it wants you to do, and "Home is Where the Candle Is" is one of them. Going to the designated location to find Janky, in the quest, will yield nothing, so where exactly is he?


How to Find Janky for Home is Where the Candle is In WoW: The War Within


Following the quest marker will lead you directly outside of Cinderbrew Meadery, with no Janky in sight. Turns out, Janky isn't actually at the quest waypoint the quest itself tells you to go to. Instead, Janky, along with Fourman Grimes, can be found in Gundargaz, The Ringing Deeps (/waypoint 48, 35), standing next to each other inside the building you kicked coal into earlier. 


Screenshot by Destructoid


Why the quest marker points to a location in the Isle of Dorm is beyond me. Even so, depending on where you are in the quest line, Janky and Fourman Grimes will potentially have another set of quests for you to accept, but at least you now know where they're hiding out. Ironically, once you've accepted Janky's quest, the original quest marker from Home Is Where the Candle Is, becomes accurate. Who knew? 


These quests, along with Home is Where the Candle Is, are part of a very lengthy quest chain that I haven't even finished myself yet. As you say suspect, they involve helping both NPCs and completion will eventually lead to completion of the Home Is Where the Candle Is. With this knowledge, Janky will hide from you no longer, so at least you can now focus on the quests themselves.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you're planning to level up your Alchemy in WoW: The War Within, then you're going to need a whole bunch of Coreway Catalyst for experiments. If you're new to the profession, then it's not exactly clear how you get the reagent, so here's everything you need to know.


Where to get Coreway Catalyst in WoW: The War Within


At the release of WoW: The War Within, there are two ways to obtain Coreway Catalyst, though one is off-limits to you if you're just starting out.


The first and primary method of obtaining it is by breaking down solutions you've already made or collected using the Neutralize Concoctions option in your Alchemy recipe list. Going this route will turn whatever alchemical creations you use as reagents into Coreway Catalyst for further experimentation. You'll need a lot of them for this process, so this is by far the most common way to get them.





Alternatively, you can also specialize in the Thaumaturgy Alchemy tree and craft them yourself. With this method, once you've invested at least 15 points into the remaining Thaumaturgy tree, you'll have a chance to create Coreway Catalyst via any Thaumaturgy you attempt, including transmutation. Since this requires 15 points invested into the Thaumatugry tree, you won't be able to jump into Alchemy using this method. This one is for those who've already been working on the profession and are looking for other ways to obtain Coreway Catalyst.


Eventually, you'll have so many Coreway Catalysts that you won't know what to do with them all. In the meantime, though, these are the best ways to obtain the reagent without too much effort.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you've been exploring Modern Warfare 3's Multiplayer maps, you may have stumbled upon the adorableness of the rubber duck collection. Although they are primarily just for show, Sledgehammer Games has hinted at a new Easter Egg, spawning a colossal-sized rubber duck for the world to see.


In the post, Sledgehammer Games offers a few hints, including the phrase, "Two foes meet where photo frame a win." Call of Duty players were quick to decipher the puzzle, pointing toward the display in MW3 Season 5's Bait map. It wasn't long until they discovered the giant duck Easter Egg, as it spawns in the ocean nearby.




Even though it's pretty easy to spot the photo frame display, a few other requirements are still needed. YouTuber DANNYonPC was one of the first to discover this, where they utilized the Operators Captain Price and Makarov. Considering their tumultuous history, the two characters correlate to the "two foes" hint mentioned earlier. You can then set yourself up for a picture-like shot by putting their faces inside the holes of the frame display, thus spawning little ducks to shoot.


I never thought I would see Price and Makarov interact in such a friendly way, but it sure is a welcome surprise. And it gets even better when the big boy appears in the ocean to commemorate this unlikely duo. However, if you want to do it yourself (with another player), your team must quickly shoot the smaller ducks near the photo display to uncover the Easter Egg.

More Call of Duty Easter Eggs are undoubtedly in the works now that the Black Ops 6 beta is almost here. I, for one, am looking forward to the ones in the upcoming Zombies mode, which has been known for its monumental Easter Eggs. Who knows? Maybe it'll spawn in a giant zombie duck.

Kazuha is great with no constellations at C0


Kazuha is a strong unit without any Constellations. Kazuha’s Constellations improve his crowd control, Energy Recharge, and buffing capabilities, but the only one that significantly changes his gameplay is Constellation 6.


If you do decide to pull for Kazuha’s Constellations, I recommend stopping at Constellation 2. C2 lets Kazuha buff his teammates’ Elemental Mastery, making him an upgrade over Sucrose in teams that would otherwise prefer her.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Much of Balatro's charm comes from how playing cards change with various buffs and peculiar jokers you can unlock as you discover new poker hands. With multiple collaborations ongoing between different games, you can take this charm a step further by making your playing cards look like The Witcher, Dave the Diver, or even Vampire Survivors characters.


How to turn on collab decks in Balatro


You can change the appearance of your Balatro deck by heading into Options, followed by Customize Deck. Here, you'll find categories for each suit, options for high-contrast colors, and arrows to pick between collaboration decks.


Screenshot by Destructoid


You can find the same option in your pause menu if you're already mid-run and want to customize your deck. That way, you won't have to leave the game and potentially mess up your current round.


Currently, Balatro has collab decks with four other games:



The Witcher


Among Us


Vampire Survivors


Dave the Diver



Since they're split by suit, you can choose which card types to stay the same and which to swap out. In short, if you love one game but don't have an opinion on the others, you can have one or two enabled and keep the rest off.


Unlike decks you unlock through winning runs, using crossover ones won't impact your interest, hands, or discards in any way. They're purely cosmetic, and you can think of them like skins for your decks. You can also use them on any deck type, so you're not limited to using specific ones to see the cards.

So, how does it work and what uses are there for the Unique Effect. We'll break down how Punishing Downpour works in Black Myth: Wukong below, along with the best builds it suits. 


What is Punishing Downpour in Black Myth: Wukong?


Punishing Downpour is an ability you unlock as you spend more skill points (or Sparks) on the left side of the Martial Arts tree of the Foundation menu. It’s a must-have skill if you like performing light attack combos and want to use a build around it.

Bullet damage is straightforward given that it's damage from bullets and similar sources like melee damage. However, Spirit isn't immediately clear. Here's what Spirit is in Deadlock.


What does Spirit do in Deadlock?


Spirit refers to anything related to ability damage. This is similar to Ability Power and Magic Resistance in League of Legends. If you get Spirit Power, you're increasing the damage to your abilities. Inversely, Spirit Resist decreases the damage dealt to you by enemy abilities. Additionally, items like Enchanter's Barrier and Mystic Burst provide a Spirit Shield which tanks ability damage …]]></summary>

The last Indie World was back in April and there was a Partner Showcase in February, but this combined presentation — the first of its kind Nintendo has ever broadcast — featured plenty of juicy reveals and date announcements, large and small, with nearly 50 game announcements included across the two showcases.

If you blinked during today's Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase, you might have missed it — but eagle-eyed JRPG fans probably spotted it, and screamed in response. The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky is getting a remake, and we got our first look at it earlier today.
While it was only briefly featured during the Western broadcast of the Direct, thank you to Japan for giving us a longer trailer, showcasing the upcoming remake — tentatively titled The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky the 1st. It's scheduled to launch worldwide in 2025 on Switch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Once you find yourself in the Pagoda Realm in Black Myth: Wukong, you’ll notice Purple Seals on many of the jail cells. Locked behind those seals are rewards and NPCs worth the trouble of breaking into those cells.


To get the rewards waiting in those chests, here's how to break Purple Seals in Black Myth: Wukong. 


Break the Purple Seals in Black Myth: Wukong

Do not worry about the seals until you reach the Upper Pagoda Shrine. Once here, there’s a boss right behind the  Captain Lotus-Vision shrine. It's quite an annoying fight since you have to deal with a lingering life-reduction mechanic. Because of this, it’s best to approach the Captain when the cycle resets.


It’s a straightforward fight, but the annoying part comes from the various dodging you have to do when it starts firing lasers. During most of its ranged attack phases, it’s hard to hit it, or you can’t hit it at all.


Make sure you have a build that can quickly knock it down or learn to dodge the oncoming beams. Once you do, this will solve one of the two big annoyances of the Pagoda Realm area.


However, if the boss fight is too much of a headache because of the health debuff, you can make your way to the very top of the area. Once you find the Mani Wheel Shrine, one of the main bosses, Captain Wise-Voice, is right ahead. 


Screenshot by Destructoid


Admittedly, this fight can be a bit annoying, too, but defeating this one here will remove the debuff when exploring below.


Just note that you may want to kill all nine of the Lantern Wardens before doing this so you won’t miss out on the rare Curio. If you defeat the boss at the Mani Wheel Shrine, the Wardens will no longer appear.


Once you do kill Lotus-Vision, you will have to re-explore the Pagoda Realm to fully complete your Chapter 3 Black Myth: Wukong run.

Today's Indie World gave us our very first look at Sea of Stars' upcoming DLC, Throes of the Watchmaker, which will be launching in Spring 2025.
Throes of the Watchmaker will take Zale and Valere to a miniature clockwork world called Horloge, where they will make friends with a brand new character. Both Zale and Valere will also have brand new roles in combat in this circus-themed world — Zale as a juggler, and Valere as an acrobat.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When we talk about a game having a sense of place, it’s often about how adroitly it covers up the necessary falsehoods of a world contrived to accommodate the player character. It’s the good kind of lie. One with purpose, like Lucas smearing vaseline over the camera lens to cover up the landspeeder’s wheels. Star Wars Outlaws, then, is a strange case. Because while its planets and cities do feel ersatz as living places, they’re kind of incredible as film sets. That’s your job here. This is where the game is. You don’t play it so much as you perform your role in a series of loving, enthusiastic callbacks. That’s a star war. This is a star war. Oh, hey, I know that! That’s one of my favourite star warses.

When he is eaten by a passing disco lizard or ravenous skull-faced vulture, it is because he is basically a delicious Squirmle existing in a horrifying cryptozoological ecosystem. He is, however, never stepped upon by a mech with a missile launcher. He is never given a shotgun and tasked with shooting the other animals. Yet that basically seems to be the elevator pitch for Uruc, a sci-fi metroidvania set in a distant future where strange life battles mechanical monstrosities.

That's not necessarily a bad thing, and with TWW out this very second it does make me think, "Hmmm, what if I do make a return". This happens every time.

Supermassive Games and Behaviour Interactive must have gotten the memo too. They've just released a demo for their next horror game The Casting Of Frank Stone, in which you are a policeman, Sam Green, who is investigating the disappearance of a child. The search leads you to Cedar Hills Steel Mill, "where chilling secrets await, revealing a far more sinister truth than anyone could have anticipated". I am anticipating: QTEs during escape sequences, branching choices that get people killed, and General Mature Content appropriate to the coming of Halloween.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Almost a decade after his acrimonious departure from Konami, the shadow of Hideo Kojima still looms over Metal Gear Solid. He's there, barely camouflaged, in the undergrowth of Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater - a remake of the fifth Metal Gear game, originally released in 2004, which tells the tale of a lone US special operator hunting superweapons and old mentors in the jungles of the southern Soviet Union. 


I say "remake" but this feels more like a re-release, in spirit. True, it now runs on Unreal Engine, with the option of a manual, third-person perspective and cover-shooter controls in addition to the old top-down viewpoints. Yes, it boasts new flourishes, such as wounds now leaving scars, and clothes picking up stray leaves. Yes, there's a new interface with floating in-world menus, which makes shuffling between the layers a bit less awkward. It's the product of much labour, with development split between Konami and external support partner Virtuos. But where Konami's other big restoration project, Bloober's Silent Hill 2 remake, is a creative dialogue with the original game, Delta seems consumed by faithfulness to Kojima's original design.

I, for one, feel like I've been grossly ill-informed. Kate, Hilary - I've been quoting you for years at parties and it seems like all this time, people have been silently judging me for my ignorance of the role giant clockwork soldiers played in the fall of the Bastille.

It’s also not a terribly accurate one. From what I saw of the game, Dinolords is more about the lords than the dinos, having as much in common with Diablo-style ARPGs as it does with classic strategy. And that’s a distinction which might just elevate it out of novelty status.

Trailered this week at Gamescom 2024, it's the fifth installment in the hitherto mobile-focussed Nikki series and it's seemingly going down a storm, with over 12 million pre-registrations so far (albeit, many of them motivated by the prospect of collectively unlocked in-game bonuses). It's also a free-to-play game, and I have the usual unanswered questions about currencies and gacha, but I'm willing to give it the benefit of the doubt for the minute, because I have not spent nearly enough of my life considering the tactical applications of ballgowns. Here's that trailer.

However! Turns out you’re trying to kill the queen. Yep, that’s, uh, that’s pretty punk.

The mission completes the long arc of foreshadowing begun by the intro's mention that capital-class spacecraft have been outlawed, following a ruinous war. It turns out that one particular evil corpo has been sneakily building one of these megaships - not only that, but you get to fly inside it, cannons ablazing. It was while doing so that teenage me realised the true exceptionality of the Video Game Artform. You can't fly inside capital ships in, like, symbolist poems or baroque symphonies, can you? You can't fly in poems or symphonies at all, unless you do so metaphorically - "metaphor" being a kind of poor man's graphics card.
The technology of flight simming has advanced mightily since G-Police's day. For instance: in Everspace 2's just-announced Titans DLC, you get to fly inside not just regular old spaceships, but massive space kaiju with procedurally generated digestive systems. Here's the trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Assassin's Creed: Valhalla, Odyssey, and Origins all have one thing in common: they've got a Discovery mode, which replaces murdering with learning. You can, quite literally, go on tours curated by historians around each of the game's respective maps. Instead of diving off a Sphinx and plunging your hidden blade into someone's spinal column, you can look up at the Sphinx and read a paragraph on its significance. Maybe view an actual, real life bit of ancient Egypt from an actual real life museum collection in-game. Perhaps embody an Anglo-Saxon lad in Valhalla, instead, and like, cook up some nettle soup having just got a fresh "Friar Tuck" at the local hair choppers (no guarantees on this last bit).
This is all to say that Black Myth: Wukong deserves such a mode, too. There were so many times throughout my review time where I stopped and stared and wondered as to something's meaning. Not only in the architecture, but in the characters, too. So here I am with a proposition: how about instead of thwacking things with my staff, I can use it as a walking stick and point it at things I want to learn about.

The square brackets are part of the title, yes, and they're also calling it "punk rock" - a combination of factors that fills me with a rage so obliterating, I can barely perceive the announcement trailer, below. It's a machinegun montage of comicbook panels and sizzling melee arcs and quips like "there's a lot of wankers between you and the sweet taste of freedom".

If a park sim based on Tim Burton’s 1996 B-Movie homage Mars Attacks wasn’t on my bingo card, it’s because I’ve recently binned it and replaced it with a bobble head that simply nods in amused acceptance at whatever videogames decide to do next. And conceptually, Jurassic World Evolution with captive humans instead of dinos isn’t not a potential winner, is it? Still, I was mildly bemused to learn that Mars Attracts, coming sometime next year, is the film’s first licensed game. But then I realised that I’d never thought to check before, which might go some way to explaining the lack of them. Do you reckon they did the pun then worked backwards from there? Respectable, honestly.

Well, some of the minds behind Unravel are working on new game called Hela. This time it's less about yarn and more about being a small mouse who does parkour. Still, it does retain some of the bodily gymnastics of its predecessor. Namely the use of tongues as bungee ropes.

Whether plundering the earth in SteamWorld Dig 2 or mucking about with magic in SteamWorld Quest, these are solid and approachable adventures that enthusiastically embrace whatever theme the developers have decided upon. Cowboys? Sure. Wizards? Why not. It barely matters, as long as it results in some good puns. As a studio, Thunderful have a reputation for hopping from one style of game to the next, boiling entire genres down to their essence, and reconstituting them with competence and style to exist within a now-familiar steampunk world of colourful pals and Saturday morning cartoon jokes. The studio is a perpetual notion machine. Yes, with SteamWorld Heist 2, they're revisiting the sci-fi bullet-bouncing of their 2016 tactics game SteamWorld Heist, but they're also introducing significant changes to create a compulsive XCOM-like full of sea-faring submariners that may be their best work yet, even against a back catalogue of blinders.

It will relax you so much that you gently petrify. Future archaeologists will marvel at you, a smiling stone figure in the ruins of a bygone civilisation. "What exactly was going on back in 2024 to inspire such a critical intensity of chillax?" they will wonder. Then, they will spot the computer screen glowing beneath its layer of dust, and the cycle will begin anew.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sorry everyone, I might have to start doing that Token RPS Starfield Liker thing again. The Shattered Space expansion, out on September 30th, probably won’t refurbish the RPG’s reputation as an overall miss – but it does ditch the proc-gen planet bloat for a single handcrafted hellhole, a true Bethesda speciality honed by years of Fallouts and Elder Scrollseses. And, if its - sadly hands-off - Gamescom showcase is any indication, it might just double down on Starfield’s own strengths as well.

In development at Sniper Elite makers Rebellion, it’s a "survival-action game inspired by real-life events" – specifically the Windscale fire, which in 1957 coated much of northern England in radioactive fallout. Atomfall’s alternative history makes Britain’s worst nuclear disaster even more disastrous, plunging the realm into full-on post-apocalyptica and leaving your good amnesiac self to dodge death with nothing but a cricket bat and whatever you can scrounge out of sheds. I like it! Mostly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've never really understood the charm of ultrawide monitors. I dare boldly to maintain that there is such a thing as Too Wide, a point beyond which the extra visual estate becomes a waste of electricity, unless you watch the screen in pairs. I can only assume people who use ultrawide monitors live in constant terror of flanking manoeuvres and demand the maximum amount of peripheral vision. Mind you, I tend to play games with my nose about 10 centimetres from the screen. Forget being flanked - it's the prospect of snipers up ahead I'm worried about.
If you're among the people who fret excessively about flankers, I've got great news from Uncle BioWare. Forthcoming RPG Dragon Age: The Veilguard will support 21:9 ultrawide monitors. The ultrawide functionality extends to cinematics - you can disable "cinematic aspect ratios" to switch off the black bars that otherwise hem in the view. It's one of several PC-specific flourishes they've just blogged about. Have a look.

Unfortunately for James, he accidentally walked straight into Gamescom. “I’m starting to think that there are a lot of video games” he informed us yesterday. Horrifying if true. Still, it does sound like he’s managing to have some fun there, mainly by hitting up Saber Interactive COO and former id Software co-owner Tim Willits for some top tips on how to avenge Edwin’s thieving ways.
Tips about kill-stealing aside, James found time to ask Willits about Space Marine 2's microtransactions, and whether there was any nervousness returning to a cult hit series… especially one a lot of people had almost given up on ever seeing again. “Even the “push forward” combat of the original was part of [id’s] inspiration when we created Doom 2016,” answered Willits. “So for me personally, it’s this huge circle. It’s always intimidating working on a franchise that people love.” But, with the right team, technology, and vision he says, “it just comes together.”

But I had a fun time with its mixture of Halo-esque trigger pulling and portalling around! So I was intrigued to give the alpha version of Splitgate 2 a go and see if it had a little more substance to it than its initial reveal, which gave off a, "it's Splitgate but with more money" feel. 
Well, I think it's… a bit serious? It certainly has more polish and some extra additions, yet I didn't come away from it thrilled by its more competitive, class-based FPS leanings. I think it just needs a bit more time, perhaps, for a portal to open and some silly rocket launchers and baseball bats and zombies to come tumbling out of it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Arc Raiders was announced back in 2021 as a free-to-play co-op third-person shooter, and has been delayed several times since. That's partly because Embark Studios' other in-development game, The Finals, progressed faster than planned and stole its momentum. It's also because it was re-tooled at some point as a PvPvE extraction shooter.

Now it's back again, aiming for release next year, and it's been re-tooled a little more: it's no longer free-to-play.

You know, something to really convey the flow of the game, rather than the admittedly impressive but nonetheless very fragmented snippets we’ve gotten so far. Now to sit back and…oh, wait. Hang on. It’s just actor Troy Baker telling me about all the great acting he’ll be doing. It is great, by the way. He’s doing a fantastic job. Maybe just, you know, a crumb of acknowledgement or elucidation over the whole ‘interactivity’ part?
Anyway, don’t mind me. I’m just an old fool who likes to press buttons. And, to be fair, it's not like Machinegames don't have a great track record. Anyway, here’s some good news: The game releases December 9th this year. Have a release date trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Little Nightmares DNA runs strong in Tarsier Studios’ new game. So much so, in fact, that I’d assumed the trailer I watched during an online preview event last week was for a new entry in the horror cinematic-platformer series, right up until the name Reanimal appeared on the screen - shortly followed by a snippet of voiced dialogue.
It’s not just the horror setting, but the Grimm’s fairytale threat, the distorted adults-made-monsters through the trauma-tinged lens of a child’s imagination. A long-limbed man riding a bicycle in a threadbare suit chases children down an alley. A gangly, bowler-hatted pursuer scuttles down a long table like a spider. It's familiar enough territory, at least at first glance. But when Tarsier have a body of work subconsciously scarred by phantasms this vivid, recurring nightmares are just as potent.

It's called Herdling and it's nothing to do with sailing across a decaying universe, but very much to do with alpine expeditions and friendly beasts. Very unexpected.

So that'd be a bit like Alien and a bit like The Thing, then. Sorry, human colonists!
Directive 8020 was teased at the end of the last Dark Pictures instalment, 2022's The Devil in Me. A trailer also leaked back in November 2022. Now, we have an official announcement video.

"To show appreciation for the community who patiently waited for the DLC, Techland will be offering Dying Light: The Beast at no extra cost to all owners of the Dying Light 2 Stay Human Ultimate Edition, delivering a full standalone adventure instead of just a DLC." That's nice! 
This seems like an odd one. I’m only tangentially familiar with the Dying Light games, but I was under the impression that the model here was releasing a single game, then updating and expanding it for years. Whether standalone adventure Dying Light: The Beast represents an attempt to course correct after Dying Light 2’s mixed reception, then, I’m not entirely sure. But if nothing else, it does share something in common with all the other adverts at Gamescom tonight: it is a game that exists, and will presumably be playable at some point.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Activision have just screened an abbreviated video of Call Of Duty: Black Ops 6 campaign level “Most Wanted”, in which you and a buddy infiltrate a US fundraiser to save returning character Adler from Bad Dudes. Good news, people who like Call Of Duty: this looks like Call Of Duty. It’s got a homing knife, an exploding remote-controlled car and a big chap in full face armour with an overcompensatory minigun. Catch the full video below.

That's lovely. Thanks videogames.  And if - as we surely must - we judge the eagerness of these adverts to spend time with us by how quickly they appear on our screens, then FPS sequel Borderlands 4 surely loves us the most.
Do we love it back? Who knows. But it does exist, and it isn’t using a subtitle. That’s got to count for something, right?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Announced at this year's Geoffcom, RoadCraft is a new game courtesy of the vehicular bods behind MudRunner and SnowRunner. This means it's very much a simulation game where you're fighting terrain with tyres, except this time you aren't just driving about, but managing a fleet of machines to carry out heavy construction work. Think a mixture of logistics, cars, cranes, and paving some lovely new roads from a once dilapidated junk heap.

You could make the same argument at the opposite end of spectrum, of course. Cosy games seem locked in a perpetual arms-race to twee each other into the dirt, chopping their rival’s dog-petting hands off and taking a sparkly tinkle on their pastel corpses. But hand-drawn RPG Heroes Of The Seven Islands feels more authentic than all that. It’s bedroom antifolk by way of chill dungeon synth, by way of an antelope sorcerer named Jean-Pierre.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Our Black Myth: Wukong review hails the game as "a generous Soulsy adventure hybrid that works within its limitations and delivers a beautiful challenge to be unpicked with a magical toolbox". Reviewer Edders went so far as to find the world more engaging than that of Elden Ring - proper defying-the-gods level rhetoric. Players seem to agree. The game launched last night, and has already accrued a concurrent player peak of 1.44 million - Steam's fourth highest ever, exceeded only by Counter-Strike, Palworld and PUBG. By that metric, it's the platform's most popular strictly single player game of all the time.
All that goodwill has been spoiled, however, by a Steam code handout message to streamers and other "content creators" before launch which includes some reactionary, non-binding requests - no mention of "trigger words" like "Covid-19", no talk of "politics" or "feminist propaganda", and no mention of "China's game industry policies, opinions, news, etc".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tactical Breach Wizards is a tactics game for people that don’t like tactics games. Magically, it’s also a tactics game for people who love them like nothing else. It’s permissive and demanding; playful and tense. Its globe-spanning plot covers conspiracies, PMCs, and brutal theocratic dictatorships. It also features a traffic-summoning warlock named Steve wearing a hi-vis robe. It’s finding that one absolutely, perfectly ridiculous XCOM turn, every turn…and at the same time knowing it’s absolutely, perfectly fine if you don’t. In short: it’s one of the most enjoyable tactics games I’ve ever played, and the only tactics game with a pyromancer so rubbish he relies on making his enemies pass out from heatstroke.

They've also shared a little about why it's taken so long to arrive - the (generally decent) action-RPG hit PS5 over a year ago, back when I was still some filthy console-playing freelancer.
According to director Hiroshi Takai, it was "impossible" to create the PC and PS5 versions at the same time, even if Square Enix hadn't been restrained by a timed exclusivity clause. He also thinks that the Final Fantasy series faces no "existential risk" right now, despite lower-than-hoped returns from both Final Fantasy 16 and, going by Square Enix's latest financial reports, the more recent and currently PS5-only Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Silent Hill has a messy, up-is-down relationship with time and history, so let's go about this hands-on with the Silent Hill 2 Remake in a messy, up-is-down way. Developed well over two decades ago, the original Silent Hill 2 is the magnum opus of Polish horror stalwarts Bloober Team. Running on then-innovative "Unreal Engine 5" technology created by Jazz Jackrabbit publishers Epic MegaGames, it's a wonderful abyss of a game that remains perfectly playable today, given a certain amount of tolerance for the quirks of the era.
It begins with your character, James Sunderland, descending from the road towards the eponymous Midwestern nowhere-town. Like many games of the period, Silent Hill 2 uses a third-person, over-the-shoulder manual camera, which allows you to glance fearfully up at the monstrous pine trees that fringe the path - each rising from a bulging tide of fog that menaces with the suggestion of approaching figures. There is moisture everywhere, gushing from drain pipes and dribbling down concrete barriers. As you amble into the murk, deathly chords and groaning, unmechanical motifs reverberate from somewhere deep underground.

The 2022 version of Modern Warfare 2 lacked the original’s multiplayer, and H2M was so highly-anticipated that Steam sales of the 2016 FPS balooned in the lead-up to the mod’s planned release date. It didn't hurt that Activision had it on sale, of course, but the timing lined up so well that some fans speculated the discount was a deliberate bait-and-switch on the publisher’s part to profit from excitement over a mod they were already planning to shut down.

As ever, we have a way of thwarting the Maw's advance, and it's... pasta sauce? Graham, why is there pasta sauce in the Trello? Have Ziff Davis subfranchised us to Dolmio? Oh, I'm sorry! That's just my shopping list. What I meant to say was: new video games! Video games (PC games, specifically) are the only thing that can preoccupy the Maw, the only thing newsworthy enough to distract it from the tempting clifftop maisonettes of Torquay. Let's see what the week has in store for us, eh.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Bloober and Konami announced that they were remaking Silent Hill 2 as part of a comprehensive series reboot, it made immediate if slightly deflating sense to me. Silent Hill 2 is the more feted of the Hills - if I were a calculating franchise custodian tasked with 'bringing back' one of the acclaimed original trilogy, that's probably the instalment I and my spreadsheets would fix upon. I mean, it's the game with Pyramid Head in it - the nearest thing Silent Hill has to a mascot, and it's not like there's an issue of cutting out plot material: each game in the Silent Hill series is, on some level, a distinct story with a distinct protagonist.
Still, the decision to 'skip' the first game in the series, whose world, narrative themes, music and art direction set the parameters for all the rest, made my brain itch a bit, and when I ran into Bloober's creative director Mateusz Lenart and lead producer Maciej Głomb at a Konami event, I had to ask about it.

Coinciding almost perfectly with the leak's 15-year anniversary, a complaint filed with Google now claims that the report violates copyright law and must be permanently deindexed from search results.

We had moderately high hopes for it before the early access release - I personally enjoy the fairytale setting, with its pop-up Pucks and magic umbrellas, but I also think I've raised enough hovels on procedurally generated maps for one lifetime. Still, I'd quite like it to come good, if only so I can justify op-eds about Lewis Carroll, and I'm somewhat encouraged by what I've heard of the game's forthcoming Realms Rebuilt update.

And either way, it's a spectacular journey that works for mostly everyone: those after challenging fights against Chinese mythological creatures, and those after the same thing, but with a little less challenge than your typical Soulslikes. What separates Black Myth from the crowd, though, is its slick presentation and a sense of generosity. You're to witness the most lavish, cinematic worlds and its creatures. And you're to enjoy battering everything with your staff as a highly athletic monkey with copious spells at his furry follicles and fingertips. It's been a while since I've played anything quite as impressive as this.

The strategy game’s 5.2 update is on the horizon, and tagging along with it are the first of the “extra bits” the team teased in June. I’m very excited about them. They sit somewhere between the usual patch fare of stat tweaks and errata, and the weightier faction facelifts that come alongside paid DLC. They’re also focused right where Immortal Empires needs them the most: depth, rather than width. In the dawi’s case, quite literally.

Both the stakes and the poly count were low. Happy news then, that it is getting a snowy sequel.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For years, our PC storage has wobbled and buckled beneath the tyranny of gigantic Call Of Duty installs. Like 13th century peasants straining to convey huge, teetering loads of freshly quarried LMGs, our SSDs cry out for justice. Perhaps scenting imminent rebellion and a mass audience desertion to low-poly shooters with more civilised file sizes, Activision have relented. Future installations of the much-padded FPS will be "smaller and more customised", though in a last cruel stroke of villainy, they want you to download a large update to prepare the ground.

Last time I checked in, it was school trips to other dimensions. Now, it's Cosmic Storms. Due for release alongside the Stellaris 3.13 Vela update on September 10th, these are a paid "mechanical expansion" (priced at a rather chunky £11, $13 or €13, and available as part of the current season pass) that builds upon the game's existing Space Storms, "providing a deeper experience with strategically meaningful gameplay and beautiful upgraded visuals". Wash that down with new civics, precursor narratives, anomalies, archaeology sites, techs, edicts, a new Ascension perk, and new galactic community resolutions.

You remember that thing, right? Plus, no-one’s got a big enough table. Or the new errata. Also, Trevor’s been banging on about lady Custodes for five months straight and nobody wants to be around him right now. Thank the Omni-trevor, then, for the three-player co-op of Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2. “Warhammer with the boys?” said Horace as he stretchily dished out preview keys from an entirely different postcode. James, Edwin and Nic were initially all booked-up for the week, but Horace repeated himself, making it absolutely clear that it wasn’t a question.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this week there was some minor Discourse about the removal of the Erotica photography tag from the Dead Rising remaster. Some readers characterised this as a familiar species of cultural hypocrisy regarding video games - emphasising violence is A-OK, but for the love of god, don't mention sex. Good news, those people: Dread XP's latest horror signing The Lacerator has both. It casts you as hirsute 1980s porn star Max - surname not given in press release, but presumably something like Jackin' or Girth - who has been abducted by a large scary individual called the Lacerator.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over 2000 hours spent in various factory games makes me a bit of a purist, I suppose. In theory, I should then be the ideal reviewer to enjoy Shapez 2. But I'm also the ideal reviewer to tear it apart over the most minor hiccups and defects. I'm the Anton Ego of factory games. I don't like food, I love it. If I don't love it, I don't swallow.
Ah, you needn't worry. This is by far the most fun I've had reviewing a game, and Shapez 2 has, in my mind at least, turned the holy trinity of factory games (Factorio, Satisfactory, Dyson Sphere Program) into a holy quartet. Its pared back, everything-is-free-forever approach is quite liberating, and I've never had so much fun placing conveyor belts in my life. But 40 hours into my save file, I've often found myself yearning for a bit more creativity in the challenges, a few more curveballs sent in my direction.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s an oddly Halloweeny summer week for games, this one. Dragon Age: The Veilguard’s October 31st release date leaked earlier, Steam have put together a Summer Fright Night bundle featuring RPS fave Hauntii, and I’ve got a strange urge to gorge on Haribo and mini Double Deckers until blood comes out of my eyeballs. What a perfect time, then, to dive into the alpha demo for vampire management game Blood Bar Tycoon, especially since Two Point seem to be resting on their laurels a bit too comfortably for my liking.
The idea here is you build a swanky bar serving claret cosmopolitans, ichor-ish coffees and uh, viscera vampiros to your undead clientele. But (with the sorta exception of the crimson-sapped Dracaena cinnabari) blood doesn’t grow on trees, so you’ll also be moonlighting as a human-nabber. You’ll research a slew of “whacky contraptions” to extract their blood, which I greatly enjoy, because “zany exsanguination” is a real winner of a feature. You can’t frivolously phlebotomise with impunity, however - you’ll also want to be on the lookout for vampire hunters aka the fun police.
