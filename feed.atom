Another way to celebrate yesterday was, apparently, to release a videogame. Apico, a beepkeeping sim about adventuring across a 2D world to collect, breed and conserve bees, is out now.

Which makes it a little odd that the marquee change in patch 4.1 is the removal of a feature: Breakthrough mode can no longer be played with 128 players, and is now limited to 64. 

Not that Battlefield 2042's website or digital store pages have been updated to reflect that change yet.

And now for something completely different. The retro enthusiasts over at Hamster have taken time out from the Namco party to offer up one of the most infamous oddities of the classic arcade era. Straight out of Data East and into your hearts, it's Trio the Punch: Never Forget Me, now available on PS4 and Nintendo Switch.
Released in arcades in the spring of 1990, Trio the Punch: Never Forget Me is a delectably daft crossover beat-'em-up that stars characters from Data East's catalog, as well as some familiar, non-sequitur stages and even some iconic works of art. Players guide one of three heroes through incredibly strange side-scrolling action — fighting cities full of ninjas, monsters in the rainforest, giant robo-guardians, stacks of animals, and even the fire-breathing Data East veteran, Karnov. This is not to make mention of the moped-riding zombies, disembodied unicorn heads, or the player's enviable final form of... a sheep.
Check out the wacky antics in the video below, courtesy of YouTuber World of Longplays.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIPtzZHJnkg
While Trio the Punch is hardly the most playable or enjoyable of classic side-scrolling actioners, the title has long cemented its place in video gaming history simply due to its nigh-on incomprehensible nature. The game does not offer any insight whatsoever in regards to plot or reason, and most on-screen text is just poorly translated (or simply garbled) gibberish. It's just a whole lot of nonsense, charmingly released as the arcade market truly started to find its feet with polished, well-produced, sensical video games. Among its contemporaries, Trio the Punch was batshit anarchy, and for that, it will remain curio in the video game hall of fame.
Trio the Punch: Never Forget Me is available to download now on PS4 and Switch, priced at $8.

Update : Two months after the Wii and DSi Shop channel outages, YouTube channel GameExplain has now reached out to Nintendo to see if it could provide any more clarification about what's going on. Unfortunately, the new statement is that it's still got "nothing to announce" about the current status of these outages. You can see Nintendo's original response below.


Original article : Last week, word quickly spread online that Nintendo's Wii and DSi Shop Channels had been offline since at least 16th March. Naturally, it sparked fears that this could potentially be the end of these digital stores, although Nintendo hadn't communicated this.

The games industry is flooding with cozy, impossibly cute life simulators right now, and as a massive fan of the genre, I personally could not be happier. Titles like Stardew Valley and Animal Crossing have left an obvious mark on the market, proving time and time again that gamers are craving a simpler, sweeter life. Next up in the long list of simulators is Little Witch in the Woods, and it's looking like a real contender to stand out among the competition and be one of my favorite games of recent memory.
Little Witch in the Woods may have just entered early access, but it's already been garnering a lot of attention on Steam and Xbox (it's also playable with Game Pass).
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lS9QHk2A6yg
Players take on the role of Ellie, a young witch who takes it upon herself to collect items in the forest and help out her neighbors. Ellie also teams up with a sentient witch hat named Virgil, and works to hone her craft as an apprentice witch, an element reminiscent of Kiki's Delivery Service (which is unsurprisingly one of my favorite movies, go figure).
Early reviews say it's very similar to Stardew by way of gameplay, just with a witchy theme about it, and there's not much else you could say that would make me want to play this game more.
The developer of Little Witch in the Woods, Sunny Side Up, is reportedly very pleased with the response to the game so far, and are continued to update players. They say that the plan is for the game to get a full launch in 2023, and to add two more story chapters and an ending in addition to the prologue and first chapter that are currently available to play.
It sounds like they have a lot more game to make, but knowing that fans are already falling in love with the project so far has to be an amazing motivator. Godspeed, Sunny Side Up — we can't wait to see what else you have in store for us.

The imminent release of Touken Ranbu Warriors brings the total number of Warriors games on Switch in the West to 11. Omega Force's crowd-whupping, hack-and-slash Musou formula started out with the Dynasty Warriors series (itself a spin-off from Koei's Romance of the Three Kingdoms) before splitting into various branches with the Samurai Warriors and Warriors Orochi series, the latter a Dynasty and Samurai crossover.
The formula's huge success soon attracted the attention of other companies and IPs. Before long a plethora of hugely successful cross-media crossovers appeared: the One Piece: Pirate Warriors series has four entries at the time of writing (two on Switch), and Nintendo-wise we've seen two Zelda-based Hyrule Warriors games and a brilliant Fire Emblem too, with a sequel — Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes — due on 24th June.

One of the contributing factors to the enduring appeal of Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild lies in its introduction of many mythical new characters to the Zelda universe. And for those of you besotted with the underwater kingdom of Zora, First 4 Figures might have a treat in store for you.
The merch-maker has offered a first look at a brand new figurine capturing the beautiful form of Zoran princess and Champion of Hyrule, Mipha. The PVC figurine stands roughly nine inches in height and is delicately poised with her formidable Lightscale Trident. Mipha's ethereal presence and compelling beauty belie her adept combat skills and overwhelmingly courageous nature, reflected in her subtle stance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGeIxpNMoMo&t
Mipha stands atop a sturdy circular base, emblazoned with the symbol of the secretive "Shadow People," The Sheikah. The base features LED lighting effects, which light up her royal highness with a delectable aqua blue glow. The Mipha figurine will look mighty fine standing on anyone's bookshelf, and will make an even better accompaniment to F4F's previous releases of Princess Zelda, Revali, and, of course, Link himself.
The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild Mipha figurine is available to pre-order now from the official First 4 Figures website. Mipha will retail for around $150 USD on release, but those who pre-order now can bag an Early Bird price of $137.99, not including shipping or any potential customs charges. Mipha is expected to ship in the fourth quarter of 2022 and payment options are also available.

If you had told us in January that an FMV murder-mystery title would become one of our most memorable experiences on the Switch this year, we’d have looked at you as if you were one of The Centennial Case: A Shijima Story’s prime murder suspects. Directed by Koichiro Ito (scenario designer for Metal Gear Solid V) and produced by Junichi Ehara (NieR: Automata) at Square Enix, it somehow slipped our notice for a while like a clever killer skulking about in the night, but we’re ecstatic to have finally caught this culprit.
The Centennial Case revolves around Haruka Kagami, a mystery novel writer, and Eiji Shijima, a scientist studying the cellular ageing process. After a skeleton is unearthed at Eiji’s ancestral home, he asks Haruka to travel with him to investigate the mysteries that surround his family, while he himself searches for a fruit passed down in his family that can halt the ageing process.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We've emerged from the depths of the BioShock series to begin a fresh season of Video Gameography! We're doing things differently this time as we're discussing the gameography of a developer rather than covering an individual game series. That studio is Supergiant Games, the acclaimed indie developer of Bastion, Transistor, Pyre, and Hades. This week, we conclude our season by analyzing 2020's Hades. 
Unlike Supergiant Games' previous titles, Hades had two release dates. Its first release came on December 6, 2018 when it launched in early access on PC, while the full game was available to be played on September 17, 2020. Hades takes everything the studio has learned up to this point and blends them into an ambitious rogue-lite that's developed in a way the team has never experienced before: with the gaming public playing the game as it's being made. Check out this episode to learn the backstory of how Pyre's large cast of characters inspired the evolving narrative of Zagreus and his dysfunctional diety family, how the studio fared developing an early access game, and learn all about Greek mythology from our guest, the incomparable Jill Grodt.
Join hosts Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), John Carson (@John_Carson), along with Game Informer associate editor Jill Grodt (@Finruin) for a verbal stroll through the history and narrative of Hades!

Not that long ago, I was out here publicly wishing that Wario Land 4 would show up on Nintendo Switch Online as my one true hail-mary GBA pick, and I'm still trying not to get my hopes up. Admittedly though, my attention is better spent on Antonblast, an upcoming PC and Nintendo Switch indie platformer that taps into the dearly departed series' vibes.
Antonblast is already winning over fans on Kickstarter, who have pushed past the game's baseline $75,000 goal on Kickstarter with a month left in the crowdfunding campaign.
If you're anything like me, the retro action-platformer footage sells itself.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's an arrr-PG
Bandai Namco is showing a bit more of the battle side of its upcoming One Piece Odyssey. The role-playing game based on hit manga One Piece is launching sometime this year, and it certainly has some RPG systems in place.
When the new One Piece game was first revealed, it definitely had some RPG vibes. Some new screenshots from the Japanese One Piece Odyssey site (as spotted by RPG Site) really emphasize just how it's tackling battles, though.

There's HP and TP, as well as a weapon triangle of sorts. There are definitely some Persona vibes to the UI elements here, and I think they actually work pretty well.

Another screenshot, shown above, also highlights some positioning mechanics. It looks like range and position on the field will be important too.
Other screenshots show different members of the Straw Hat Pirates using their various abilities to navigate the environment. From slicing a gate in half to seemingly flying across the map, it looks like overworld traversal mechanics will play a role too.

Straw hat life
I am, admittedly, not a huge follower of One Piece. I've dug other Shonen Jump series like Jujutsu Kaisen and My Hero Academia, but never taken the dive on One Piece, due in large part to just how lengthy it is. My backlog is already gigantic.
That said, these screenshots are making a pretty good case for checking out One Piece Odyssey. While anime spinoffs usually veer into fighting games or other action-oriented formats, RPGs are relatively unexplored territory. Bandai Namco seems to really be going for a full-on RPG with One Piece Odyssey though, with screenshots more evocative of Persona and the Atelier series.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yogS2oJ2pZI
No firm date's been set yet, but One Piece Odyssey is due out sometime this year for PC, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4, and PS5.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The little PlayStation mascot that could
The next PlayStation character to get a Nendoroid is none other than Astro from Astro Bot Rescue Mission and Astro's Playroom, and that goes to show how far this mascot has come.
I mean it! We were talking about Good Smile Company's figure for Aloy (of Horizon Zero Dawn and Forbidden West fame) just a few days ago. And now here's the humble little bot, looking like a champ. When's the next game? There's got to be another one.
https://twitter.com/GoodSmile_US/status/1527487300283801610
Good Smile Company is taking pre-orders, and you'll have until June 29 to partake. The Astro Nendoroid costs $63.99, and it's aiming to ship in February 2023, but as Siliconera points out, these things have a tendency to slip. You'll need some patience either way.
Aside from the default face, Astro also comes with swappable "dizzy" and "smiling" expressions, as well as accessories: a fuse, a PlayStation coin, and laser feet.
I love this design as is, and it's a natural fit for the Nendoroid line, but one thing is missing. Imagine if they recreated some of the collectible PlayStation console "artifacts" from Astro's Playroom. The pack-in PS5 game was such a nostalgic, nod-filled collect-a-thon.
The Astro Bot figure is so cute and pure, I feel guilty for neglecting Astro's Playroom — a game I got all of the trophies for but admittedly haven't thought about much since the PS5 launched. I should download that again (you can never have enough free space...) and try to improve some of my times. Or maybe I'll just pop back in to soak up the jams.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The conclusion to the first season of Master Chief's TV adventures is finally here, but did it stick the landing or continue to frustrate us? Join us for another special episode of The GI Show, where we're reviewing both episode nine of Halo and season one as a whole.


The regular team is back to wrap up the season, but we couldn't do a Halo review without a familiar friend. Alex Stadnik, Brian Shea, and Andrew Reiner are joined by Kate Sánchez, founder of But Why Tho? to break down the highs and lows of this episode and the season in this spoiler-filled discussion.
In episode nine, we find John and company reeling from the fallout of Makee's decision, setting the stage for the final battle. The good news is that "Transcendence" has plenty of satisfying action that genuinely feels like what we love about Halo as a video game. The bad news is those questionable story choices continue to bring down our enjoyment of the series.
When looking at the first season as a whole, it's clear that plenty of things could have been better. In that spirit, we finish out this episode of The GI Show and our Halo review with our thoughts on the state of Master Chief, Halsey, and Co.'s tale and whether or not we're excited about a second season. We also grade the show on the GI review scale for those dying to know what we thought numerically.
Thank you so much for joining us on this journey. While the show had its ups and downs, it was so fun to get to chat with the community on a weekly basis. We hope you enjoyed these videos, and we're so excited to continue our review series in the not too distant future. 
What do you think about Halo? Be sure to let us know in the comments below. We'd also love your feedback on the extra GI Show episodes. Do you like them? Do you want to see us focus on games or the Marvel shows in the future? Please email us at podcast@gameinformer.com or reach out on Discord as we want to know what you think.]]></summary>

Developer:

Release:

Fueled Up is a four-player couch co-op game set in space announced last month and the first trailer had us convinced it would make for some chaotic, and great, co-op sessions. We couldn't help ourselves so we reached out to Fireline Games to ask if we could play it and they said yes. And now, today, you get to watch more than 20 minutes of our gameplay!


As you'll soon hear, not only did your hosts, Game Informer editors Wesley LeBlanc and Alex Stadnik, get the chance to go hands-on with Fueled Up, they were joined by two of the devs from Fireline Games – Kacper Kowalczuk and Chris Heldt – to round out the four-person team. If you're wondering how we did so well playing Fueled Up, just know it's because Wesley and Alex are really good at video games and totally not because they had two people who actually created this game helping them. 
VIDEO
Enjoy this first look at Fueled Up gameplay on PC as Wesley and Alex ask them questions about the game, how the four-person development studio developed it, what they're hoping to add to the cooperative multiplayer space, and more. Be on the lookout for Fueled Up when it hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC sometime this year. 
For more about Fueled Up, be sure to watch the reveal trailer from last month. For more previews of some of the biggest games of 2022 and beyond, be sure to head over to our YouTube page for early looks at Diablo Immortal, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge, MultiVersus, Bear And Breakfast, and more.

BattleTanx was 3DO’s first N64 game and a pretty decent success for a company that was trying to pivot from their failed hardware endeavor. As 3DO would soon prove, they were crazy about franchises and sequels. It’s not surprising that BattleTanx would be up for a new entry the very year after it launched.
Creative director, Michael Mendheim, was nice enough to humor some of my questions about BattleTanx, so it seemed natural to also pivot to its sequel. Here’s the thing: even though he’s credited as creative director for BattleTanx: Global Assault, he wasn’t heavily involved in its design. According to him, “My involvement in BattleTanx: Global Assault was mostly just pre-production just to make sure nothing went off the rails.”

Nintendo has been doing things behind our backs again. Well, not really — companies adjust video game character models pretty often, usually between console generations or as graphics engines improve. But people can get pretty protective of particular character models. Some people prefer Sonic's sprite in Sonic the Hedgehog 3 & Knuckles as it's a little pointier and has smaller eyes, and Pikachu started shedding weight between Pokémon Red & Blue and Pokémon Gold & Silver.
So, with this in mind, we have a question for Nintendo — why do you keep making Pauline shorter?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Polygonal Phantasies
In a little over a month's time, we will be welcoming old-school gaming hero Klonoa back into our humble little lives. Bandai Namco is preparing for the release of the remastered Klonoa Phantasy Reverie Series on PC and consoles, and has dropped a short, nostalgia-sparking clip from the retro adventures.
As previously reported, Klonoa Phantasy Reverie Series is a compendium containing remasters of the 2008 Wii release Klonoa: Door to Phantomile (itself a remake of the 1997 PlayStation original) and the 2001 PS2 sequel Klonoa: Lunatea’s Veil. Developed by Monkeycraft, the two games have been lovingly restored with sharp HD visuals, 60 FPS gameplay, and boosted with new features, including rebalanced difficulty options and an all-new two-player co-op mode.
2022 sees Klonoa celebrate their 25thn birthday, so now is the perfect time to release this delightful looking retrospective of their most memorable adventures. Sadly, the compendium will not contain all of the Klonoa titles — so you won't find their Game Boy Advance or Wonderswan adventures herein — but it will at least be fun to visit the charming world of Lunatea, looking fresher and more colorful than ever before.
Klonoa is one of a number of somewhat forgotten gaming heroes making a grand comeback, so it's a pretty rad time to be a fan of classic platforming adventures. Klonoa Phantasy Reverie Series launches July 8 on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Edelgard and co. get some new duds
The next faction spotlight for Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes is here, and it's all about Edelgard and the Black Eagles.
The Adrestian Empire is the banner they'll be fighting under, but Three Houses players will remember this motley crew as the Black Eagles. Edelgard is here, of course, but in today's trailer we get to see all the former students in action.
There are some neat touches here, considering the variety of skillsets in the Black Eagles. Two little aspects I dug were Dorothea using singing as a weapon, and Petra's big attack utilizing a bow (since she is an Assassin class when you fight her in other houses' campaigns).
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EGQ3oKDcj0
Two houses down, one to go
That's two of Fire Emblem: Three Houses' big factions down, one left to go. It looks like since we have Black Eagles and Blue Lions covered, the Golden Deer will be the last crew to get a spotlight.
That said, it's impressive to see how every student in each house is a full-on playable character in Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes. With just the three houses and protagonist Shez, that's 25 characters.
I'm curious to see if we get any of the school staff or the endearing basement goths from the Ashen Wolves campaign. And I'd be really surprised if Anna, the series' long-running "mascot" merchant, doesn't also make an appearance.
I'm hopeful (ha) that Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes will turn out as a pretty good musou game, as the Nintendo crossovers have run the gamut. The Hyrule Warriors side has been generally solid to pretty darn good. But Fire Emblem Warriors missed some of that spark.
With a laser focus on just Fódlan and the world of Fire Emblem: Three Houses, maybe Three Hopes can make the Warriors side click. Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes hits Nintendo Switch on June 24.

Tchia was first announced at the 2020 Game Awards and unfolds on a beautiful island inspired by New Caledonia. Players control a young girl with the magical ability to inhabit the bodies of animals as well as inanimate objects, such as coconuts. Exploration involves sailing to different tropical islands in an open ocean as well as climbing through forests and soaring across the landscape on a glider. The game last appeared at the 2021 Game Awards where it got a 2022 release window.

Developer Awaceb posted an update on Twitter explaining that it needs to delay the game to tinker on it further, saying in part “this extra time will allow us to really polish every aspect of the game and flesh out all the little details that we know will make Tchia a really special experience.” 
Tchia is slated to launch on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and PC. You can catch up on every big game delayed to next year here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bring back that lovin' feelin'...
It's been some time since we last heard from action-packed sky-flier Ace Combat 7, but would-be pilots will certainly be feeling the need for speed come May 26, when Bandai Namco drops a batch of brand new DLC based on Paramount Pictures' upcoming blockbuster Top Gun: Maverick. 
The Ace Combat 7 — Top Gun: Maverick Aircraft Set DLC adds two new skyfighters to the game's hanger. First up is the stunning F/A-18E Super Hornet, as flown by Top Gun's white-teethed, cheesy-grinnin' hero Pete "Maverick" Mitchell, portrayed in the movie series by alien daredevil Tom Cruise. Oh, and for those of you who truly want to take it right-in-to-the danger zone, then it seems that a replica of Maverick and Goose's F-14A Tomcat from the 1986 movie is also included.
The trailer below spotlights the F/A-18E Super Hornet, as well as the movie's fret-wanking theme.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7ujkyWqbfo
Released way back in 2019, which today feels a whole world away, Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown was a hit with the dedicated Ace Combat community, who celebrated its snazzy visuals, frenetic gameplay, and surprisingly deep lore. The initial release would be followed by a slew of extra missions and aircraft updates. While the game is certainly in its twilight years today, this Top Gun: Maverick crossover is an absolute no-brainer, and will be likely very welcome among the game's long-time community of players.
Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown is available now on PS4, PC, and Xbox One. Top Gun: Maverick premieres in theaters May 27 and is, apparently, an excellent sequel, with some reviewers going as far as to say that it surpasses the original. Jennifer Connelly is in it, so that seems a given, to be honest.

PlayStation owner Sony Corporation has announced that it is accelerating its environmental upgrade plans by 10 years. In a new statement (as noted by Eurogamer), the industry giant announced that it would be bringing its "Road to Zero" green efficiency plan forward, with an aim of severely reducing its carbon footprint within the coming decades.
Sony is looking to achieve its ambitious renewable energy goals by revising the power input and output of its global network of offices and production plants. The PlayStation publisher will be looking to install solar panels at its various international locations, whilst exploring other energy-saving measures. The company hopes to have increased its renewable energy usage to 35% by 2025, and 100% by 2030.
In addition, Sony hopes to be fully carbon neutral by 2040, while also ensuring that its wide variety of home entertainment products also produce less planet-harming emissions and run as energy-efficiently as possible. The climax of the "Road to Zero" plan would see Sony achieve its "zero environmental footprint throughout the lifecycle of Sony's products and business activities" goal by the year 2050.
For more details on the updated Road to Zero plan, check out Sony's official statement.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Brain reaction.
Recently, I was talking to my partner about my all-time favourite niche genre of games. He's a game developer, so we have these kinds of discussions a lot, usually trying to nail down what it is we like best about a particular game, or scene, or genre — but this time, we were trying to find out exactly what the genre even was.
Now, I have a particular bugbear when it comes to game genres, which is that they're all pretty stupid. They're not helpful for casual consumers (who often don't know what things like "roguelike" are) and they're largely descriptive of the actions one takes or responds to ("shooter", "platformer") rather than the tone or feeling of a game. I mean, these genres can be useful, like, for example, if you're making really cool lists of games and you need some kind of unifying feature so you can let people know where to find what they're looking for, but otherwise, game genres are weirdly unhelpful, mechanical, and self-referential.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A not-so-long time ago in the same galaxy we all reside in, Respawn Entertainment deviated from its first-person shooter roots to create Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. This third-person action game was the studio’s first stab at tackling the coveted Star Wars license, crafting an original adventure set five years after Revenge of the Sith. It stars Cal Kestis, a padawan turned junker (played by Shameless star Cameron Monaghan) that managed to evade the Jedi purge of Order 66. After he’s outed by the Sith, he embarks on a quest to recover an artifact capable of locating force-sensitive children while also avoiding capture by the Inquisitors, who are elite Jedi hunters. 
The game features a blend of lightsaber combat and a suite of Force abilities. Borrowing inspiration from FromSoftware’s Soul series, encounters are challenging, requiring a strategic blend of blocks and parries to outduel opponents. Meanwhile, the various planets take on a Metroid-inspired progression with players unlocking abilities to backtrack to previously inaccessible areas. 
Watch on Twitch!
Fallen Order was released on November 15, 2019, and was a critical and financial success. It also served as a saving grace for single-player fans, providing proof to an increasingly multiplayer-focused EA that linear story-driven experiences can still make the big bucks. With a sequel reportedly in the works, we’re revisiting this gem of the Star Wars video game pantheon. 
Join Marcus Stewart, Andrew Reiner, and John Carson on Twitch today at 2 p.m. Central as we journey through the entirety of Cal Kestis’ adventure. Expect plenty of laughs, deaths, and general nerding out over all things Star Wars. We encourage you to hang out with us in chat. Just as a reminder, subscribing to Game Informer on Twitch rewards access to the official Game Informer Discord channel where you can interact with our lovely community as well as the editors. See you in chat!]]></summary>

After a nigh-on 18-month hype period, Nexon is finally preparing to unleash its good-looking fighter DNF Duel upon the world. As we edge ever closer to its June 28 launch date, the publisher is spittin' out new trailers left, right, and center — even affording the fighter's Practice Mode its own spotlight!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMmd77abac0
The trailer offers us a glimpse of DNF Duel's Training and Tutorial modes, which hope to get newcomers up and running while helping veteran fighting game players adapt to DNF Duel's flow and mechanics.
We can see from the video that the Training Mode is packed out with all of the requisite options, including gauge management, record/playback functions, character stances, wake-up practice, and much more. In addition, the tutorial offers playable trials teaching players basic movement all the way up to performing DNF Duel's attractive and dynamic Supers.
An adaptation of Korean MMO Dungeon Fighter Online, DNF Duel is developed by fighting game veterans Eighting and Arc System Works, which automatically lend the new title a solid sense of quality and legitimacy. It will be an uphill battle for the plucky upstart to find its name among the Tekkens and Street Fighters of the scene, but it's looking like a pretty slick scrapper, and I'm excited to check out the final product.
DNF Duel launches June 28 on PlayStation and PC platforms. Be sure to check out the previous trailers introducing us to characters for Berserker, Grappler, Hitman, Inquisitor, Striker, Ranger, Dragon Knight, Vanguard, Kunoichi, Crusader, and Ghostblade.

Well, it looks like more Death Stranding is on the way. Norman Reedus, star of The Walking Dead TV series who played Sam "Porter" Bridges in Death Stranding, seems to have just confirmed a part two in a new interview.
In an interview with LeoEdit (spotted by GamerUP), Reedus is asked about filming for the Death Stranding video game. To which he responds, "We just started the second one."
In a follow-up question, Reedus tells the story of how he and Hideo Kojima met through mutual friend Guillermo Del Toro. He describes seeing an early version of Kojima's Silent Hill project. Reedus committed and well, the rest is long, fraught video game history.
"It took me maybe two or three years to finish all the MoCap sessions and everything," said Reedus. "It takes a lot of work. And then the game came out, and it just won all these awards, and it was a huge thing, so we just started part two of that."
Well, that certainly reads like two confirmations of a new Death Stranding.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlLEmu8c-Vk
Bridging the gap
Kojima has teased a bit about his next project in the past. In June 2020, he posted some images of his workspace as he worked on a new title with Yoji Shinkawa, one of his longtime collaborators. Fans at the time even spotted the word "Bridges" on some concept art.
But Kojima has also been rumored to up to several different projects. A report indicated he was working with Microsoft for an Xbox game. And he also told Famitsu that his next project is a big title that is a "new challenge."
Death Stranding did get a Director's Cut last year, adding new content and tools for Sam to make the journey across America. We haven't had any indication of a sequel until now though. But according to Norman Reedus, I guess we can look forward to a possible new Death Stranding.

Pokémon games have had their fair share of criticism over the years, often specifically targeting their visuals. It seems like such criticism has only increased in time, too, with the likes of Pokémon Legends: Arceus, Pokémon Sword & Shield, and even the recently announced Pokémon Scarlet & Violet all receiving significant heat from fans over their graphical styles.
Well, Twitter user @pokeyugami has created what we believe may well be the most perfect realisation of a 3D Pokémon game we've seen yet. By creating a kind of cel-shaded effect and utilising the art style of Pokémon character designer Ken Sugimori, @pokeyugami has created a fantastic blend of old and new.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Death Stranding hit the PlayStation 4 back in 2019. Since its release, and subsequent Director’s Cut rerelease, fans have wondered what was next for Hideo Kojima, the director of Death Stranding and the Metal Gear Solid series. 
It seems that what’s next might be a sequel to Death Stranding. That’s because in a new interview with Leo, Death Stranding actor Norman Reedus, who plays Sam Bridges in the game, seems to have confirmed a second one is now in production, as spotted first by GamerUP on Twitter. When asked about Death Stranding, Reedus said “we just started the second one” before diving deeper into how he got involved with the first Death Stranding. 
Death Stranding 2, or a sequel to Death Stranding, has not been officially revealed or even hinted at by PlayStation or Kojima. Of course, Kojima could be working on other games right now too – in fact, he recently hinted that he might be working on two upcoming games – and those might even release before this Death Stranding sequel if what Reedus said is true. Only time will tell for now but it’s great to be a Death Stranding fan, it seems. 
In the meantime, read Game Informer’s Death Stranding review and then read our impressions of Death Stranding Director’s Cut. Read about how Kojima might be working on two upcoming games after that.

        <updated>2022-05-20T14:44:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo announced in February that it plans to discontinue Wii U and 3DS eShop purchases in March 2023. However, the sunsetting process gradually rolls out throughout 2022. The lights begin turning off on Monday, May 23, when players lose the ability to add eShop funds using credit cards.
If you’ve recently turned on your 3DS or Wii U, you likely received a notification reminding you that your stored credit cards will soon become useless. You’ll still be able to add money using Nintendo eShop gift cards – that option won’t disappear until August 29. But if you want to take advantage of the convenience of using your own payment methods without taking a trip to the store, this weekend is your last chance to unleash a final spending spree. Nintendo has not specified the exact time on Monday that credit cards will be disabled.  
Keep in mind that even once credit and gift card options go away, players can link their Nintendo Network ID wallet (used for the 3DS/Wii U stores) with their Nintendo Account wallet (used to buy Switch games). The combined balance of both wallets can be used buy software on all three platforms. Once August passes, this will be the only method of buying 3DS/Wii U games until the March deadline. Afterward, whatever funds remain can only be spent on Switch purchases. 
As a final reminder, you will still be able to play 3DS/Wii U games online and redownload purchased games, DLC, and updates after March 2023. Nintendo states this will remain the case for “the foreseeable future.”

While we're all patiently waiting for a brand new Mega Man game, there are plenty of reasons to revisit the Blue Bomber's very best. And now Nintendo is just giving us more reason to pick up these classics on Switch. The Big N has slashed the price of multiple games in the Mega Man series.
Arguably Capcom's most iconic franchise, Mega Man has always felt right at home on Nintendo consoles, debuting on the NES in 1987, but besides a few collections and the mobile game Mega Man X DiVE, we've not had a brand new game since Mega Man 11 in 2018.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The old waiting game...
Square Enix has splurged out on a selection of mysterious trademarks, recently filed in Japan and seemingly related to its iconic RPG title Final Fantasy VII Remake as well as multiple unknown IPS.
The first of the three trademarks, as noted by Gematsu, is for Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade. A title that is already available on PS5 and PC via Epic Games Store. The trademark could suggest that a re-release is being prepared, perhaps for the PC via the Steam Store or for another platform entirely.
The other two trademarks are a total mystery, and see the publisher lay claim to "Final Bar Line" and "Labyrinth Striker." Interestingly, both titles sound like they'd be more fitting as subtitles than actual game names, which has led some to theorize that they may represent spin-offs from some of Square's franchises, such as Kingdom Hearts, Bravely Default, Dragon Quest, Octopath Traveler, or, of course, Final Fantasy itself.
For now, it all remains little more than speculation. But, with another summer of gaming reveals up ahead, it will be interesting to see if any of these new names will be coming into play in the latter half of 2022.

For starters, the upcoming Disney Plus show, Obi-Wan Kenobi, begins next week and Disney and Fortnite have an extensive history of collaborating ahead of big releases like movies or TV shows. There’s also the fact that Obi-Wan’s lightsaber is already in Fortnite as it was one of four added to the game during its May the Fourth Star Wars Celebration period. 
Now, it’s official: the Jedi master is coming to Fortnite to find the high ground. More specifically, he’ll hit the Fortnite Item Shop on Thursday, May 26, at 8 p.m. ET. That’s just in time for his big Disney Plus show, which begins the next day. As for what to expect, here’s a look:

And in that stream, we got a handful of new trailers that each show off one of four different time periods.
We've already seen Prehistory and Imperial China, so these next four will be new to anyone not familiar with the game. One thing to say, though, is they all look amazing. Thanks to Square Enix Asia for posting the English trailers!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Player Toxicity Expected
Funcom has released a new trailer for its upcoming doomsday shooter Metal: Hellsinger — the new video features the unmistakable vocals of Serj Tankian, long-time frontman of metal band System of a Down. Tankian joins a roster of metal legends that will soundtrack the next-gen shooter's violent chaos.
"What can you even say! We have so many System of a Down fans in the studio, adding Serj Tankian to our already incredible roster of vocalists feels unreal," said David Goldfarb of developer The Outsiders. "He completely killed the track and made it his own in a way only Serj could. We are so excited and can’t wait to see everyone playing!"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vig4_lsrpto
As FPS fans will immediately note, Metal: Hellsinger features the typically apocalyptic vibe of the genre's roots, founded in titles such as Doom, Hexen, Quake, and Heretic. In a fun new twist on the classic first-person gameplay, however, players will be rewarded for their ability to run 'n' gun to the beat of the game's bass-pounding score, chaining together combos and meaty acts of destruction in time with the music — a gimmick similarly explored to solid effect in 2021 release BPM: Bullets per Minute.
Tankian joins a horn-throwing roster of composers that already includes Arch Enemy's Alissa White-Gluz, Trivium's Matt Heafy, and the dulcet tones of Lamb of God's Randy Blythe. More artists are expected to be announced in the near future. It feels as though Mike Patton should most definitely be here, but the Faith No More/Fantomas frontman is currently taking a well-earned sabbatical from work, so that may just be wishful thinking on my part.
Metal: Hellsinger is currently in development for PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X.

The Bow in particular wins a lot of style points in terms of the moveset and some of the hunter animations - if you're going to take down monsters from a distance, you may as well do it with extra flair.

We gawked at the coolest booths on the show floor. I got nightmares after looking at a super cursed baby. My personal highlight, though, was talking to the Pinny Arcade collectors during the show's official trading event.


I’ll admit, before I went to PAX I didn’t really appreciate how big Pinny Arcade was. I’d definitely seen photos of colourful metal pins depicting characters from various video games fly across my screen as I browsed Twitter, but I had never thought much about them beyond that. I was shocked, then, to arrive at PAX and realise just how integral this collectable is to the show. Merch booths sell starter packs, individual demo stations flog game specific rarities and avid fans adorn their lanyards with their favourite pieces. It turns out, Pinny Arcade is huge.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TT Games’ Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga hit consoles and PC last month and since its release, it’s received two new character packs. Today, however, it received its first patch and after downloading it, you’ll find that there are 34 new Kyber Bricks to discover. 
While this is the first update for The Skywalker Saga, it is surprisingly a smaller one, bringing just a few fixes and a handful of Capital Ship encounters with it, as reported by Nintendo Everything.


Here’s a look at the full patch notes for this May 2022 update: 
Numerous fixes to stability, quality, progression and performance issues throughout the title, including fixes for:
Issue in Episode 7 where in certain situations Maz would not be present on Takodana to continue Story mission ‘Friends of the Resistance’.
Issue in Episode 3 where in certain situations the level trigger for ‘The High Ground’ could fail to appear.
Issue in ‘Green Harvest’ freeplay mission where under certain criteria the camera would be stuck on Tatooine indefinitely.
Implemented 4 new Capital Ship encounters in Local Space adding 34 additional Kyber Bricks to collect:
Fulminatrix
Home One
Invisible Hand
Venator
As you can see, the patch fixes three issues that, if encountered, could stop your progression forward in the game. It also adds four new Capital Ship encounters to The Skywalker Saga, which includes with it 34 additional Kyber Bricks to collect. 
While waiting for this patch to download, read Game Informer’s Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga review, and then check out our guide of codes to unlock additional characters in Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga. Check out these awesome new Star Wars dioramas recently debuted by Lego after that.

Incoming From Bend Studio:

May 19, 2022
Bend Studio announced in a tweet today that Syphon Filter is going to come packed with trophies to obtain when it releases as part of the upcoming PlayStation Plus expansion. The tweet reads, "Incoming From Bend Studio: Agency intel reports that Syphon Filter will include trophies when it arrives on the all-new PlayStation Plus." The message was delivered with an attached video of a silver trophy notification for a milestone called "An Explosive Start." A follow-up tweet reveals the existence of a platinum trophy for the game as well. That trophy has the name "Excellent work, Agent."
With the reveal of Syphon Filter joining the ranks of platinum-able games, more studios will hopefully follow suit and reveal whether their games will use the achievement system. Sony unveiled a selection of games coming to PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium subscription tiers, including original PlayStation games like Ape Escape, Hot Shots Golf, I.Q. Intelligent Cube, and Jumping Flash, though Syphon Filter is the only one on the list confirmed for trophy support.
PlayStation Plus' revamp adds two more pricing tiers with value-adds such as a downloadable game library and cloud streaming on compatible devices and PCs. You can read about the pricing and tier differences here. The new subscription tiers go live on June 13 in North America.
Which classic PlayStation games would you like to see with trophy support? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

Classic PlayStation games are coming to PS4 and PS5 in June with the new $120-per-year PlayStation Plus Premium tier, and as it turns out, they'll have trophies — at least, some of the games will. In a tweet this afternoon, Bend Studio shared a surprise clip featuring an all-new trophy, "An Explosive Start," for the PS1 classic Syphon Filter.
In a response to a fan on Twitter, Bend Studio design manager Eric Jensen said he "helped out with a few of [the trophies], mostly naming."

Thankfully, the fans are willing to take things into their own hands, because the Fallout modding community just dropped a huge bomb, as it were: Fallout London, a DLC-sized story mod of Fallout 4 that explores life after the nuclear apocalypse in England.

The Iron Giant was an important movie to me growing up. I always loved the animation style, and although it's a movie that's known for being a tear-jerker, it earns it with some excellent writing. It's a shame that Warner Bros. Animation shut down in 2004, because they had some truly iconic films back in the day. I don't know anyone who wasn't touched by the story of friendship and pacifism that we saw from The Iron Giant. I think a lot of us who grew up with the film feel a bit protective over it because of how earnest it was — or at least, that's how I feel. That's why I'm up in arms about the Iron Giant kicking some ass in MultiVersus, and I know I'm not the only one who feels that way.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Street Fighter 6 was announced late last night, and I can’t stop watching the short trailer that debuted the title. Ryu’s new model looks very impressive, and wow, is he a wide dude. He’s becoming one thick, square, sweaty muscle. Luke, on the other hand, looks way different from his recent debut in SFV, sporting a much more realistic hairstyle and veiny arms that would make John Cena jealous. We have almost no information on the game as of now, but that won’t stop us from thinking about the possibilities of what may come with SF6 or what we want the next big chapter in the series to be.
Capcom is no stranger to live service games, nor do they lack experience in seasonal content. Street Fighter V had plenty of both, with four seasons of new characters, plenty of costumes, and new stages. N…]]></summary>

Last we heard, the team at Santa Monica Studio was "heads down, hard at work" on God of War Ragnarok, with nothing new to show just yet. Today, the developers had something fresh to share about the sequel's expanded accessibility features — including better controller remapping and "more customization to our combat and interaction system."
According to lead UX designer Mila Pavlin, God of War Ragnarok will bring back accessibility features that players saw in the PC version of God of War (2018): auto sprint, an always-on reticle, and a "hold" or "toggle on/off" option for the aim stance and shield stance.
Those are just some returning options. In a PlayStation Blog post outlining some of the new features (with image and video examples incl…]]></summary>

Photorealism in games can be really fun. Having characters and environments that look just like real life can help immerse you in a game's world, and it can be exciting to see how graphics continue to improve year after year. But here's the thing — I sometimes feel like we can obsess a bit too much over how real or not real a certain game's art style is, picking apart every environment and every little detail on the character models.
I think back to the PS1 era, when people thought that the first Metal Gear game was as realistic-looking as they come. Players gushed about the immersion because of how lifelike it was. We laugh about it now, but anecdotes like that really speak to how much our minds fill in the gaps when it comes to storytelling, somet…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Maid in Japan
It appears that the fanservice fanatics over at CyGames are getting set to launch a brand new franchise, following on from its application for "Akiba Maid War" with The Japan Trademark Association.
Cygames, renown for cutesy cult franchises such as Granblue Fantasy, The Idolmaster, and Dragalia Lost, was granted the trademark on May 10, picking up the domain name for the property soon after. No details were revealed as to the context of Akiba Maid War, with only a simple logo released so far. As noted by Gematsu, the Japanese text "Akiba Meido Sensou" is a fun pun, as "Meido" is phonetically pronounced "Maid" but as written is the word for "Underworld."
That's all well and good, CyGames, but frankly, I just want my tea and biscuits. Failing that, I just want to dress up as a maid. No doubt we will hear more about Akiba Maid War as the year progresses, as it's getting to be about that time. Maybe it'll be a great third-person console adventure, maybe it will be a garbage gacha mobile game. Until Cygames is ready to spill the tea, it could go either way. Schrodinger's Maid, if you will. (You won't.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[June is starting to stack up
Summer is just around the corner. Alongside the sunshine and blue skies, more games showcases are cropping up for the annual airing of game showcases, like the Future Games Show.
GamesRadar+ announced today that the Future Games Show will air on Saturday, June 11 at 3 p.m. ET / noon PT. The show will air on Twitch, YouTube, and several other major streaming locales.
https://twitter.com/FutureGamesShow/status/1527334286893801488
The show advertises it will have "over 60 minutes" of trailers, world premieres, and surprises in store.
Are you ready for the summer?
It's the middle of May, just a few weeks out now from June, and already the month is getting lined up. Several showcases are already slotting their times in for the second weekend in June, kicking off with Summer Game Fest Live on June 9.
The sister show of Future, PC Gamer's PC Gaming Show, airs the following day (June 12) at 3:30 p.m. ET / 12:30 p.m. PT. And on the same day as Future Games Show, both the Guerrilla Collective and the Wholesome Games Direct will show off some games too.
Xbox and Bethesda, meanwhile, air their joint showcase on June 12 at 1 p.m. ET / 10 a.m. PT.
Other major platforms and publishers, including Sony, Nintendo, and Square Enix, have yet to formally announce their plans. Several signs are pointing to some Final Fantasy news in June though, so we can expect to see something from the publisher then.
All of these streams and announcements fall under the same week we'd usually be heading out for E3, even though there's no E3 this year. The ESA confirmed it's fully sitting out this year, planning to return in 2023. The Summer Game Fest has meanwhile risen in the interim, and will at least be kicking off the summer festivities. It's not a normal year, but it hasn't been for a while now. At least we know one weekend in June will still be crammed full of video game showcases.

Yep, yer boy Chris Moyse is here with more gaming news for those Of A Certain Age. Publisher Leonardo Interactive and developer Smallthings Studios have announced a brand new game starring one of the point 'n' click genre's formative home computing heroes, Simon the Sorcerer!
Neither a remaster nor a remake, Simon the Sorcerer Origins will be a prequel to the original 1993 Adventure Soft classic, as a rebellious young man falls under the tutelage of his friend, guide, and mentor, Calypso. Simon the Sorcerer Origins will retain the exploratory, point 'n' click gameplay of yore, complete with item puzzles, a wide cast of characters, and a comical, tongue-in-cheek script.
Check out an early development trailer below, courtesy of IGN.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTnK19Ezu7Y
According to Leonardo Interactive, this officially licensed prequel features slick, cartoonish artworks, and sporting dynamic transitions that allow gameplay to flow seamlessly in and out of cutscenes. As players explore Simon's newfound powers, they will learn of the events that led up to his mythical 1990s escapade.
Fresh off of Ron Gibert's recent Return to Monkey Island announcement, point 'n click fans will be stoked to hear of Simon's return. Hopefully, this brand-new adventure will capture the magic and enchantment of its old-school roots. Simon the Sorcerer Origins will launch in 2023 on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms.

Wrapped up in that idea that they're all pulled from a mysterious alien games console, CosmOS 9 packs nine games that are each meant to take 30-90 minutes. I've played a few and they seemed puzzle game staples, having me drawing paths through blocks, figure out how a mysterious computer interface worked, and such. See the breadth of the cosmic puzzling experience in the trailer below.

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/05/19/marvel-snap-a-new-collectible-card-game-for-pc-and-mobile-announced"/>
        <updated>2022-05-19T17:00:01.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yesterday, Marvel teased that it would be announcing a new video game today, and it has done just that with Marvel Snap, a new free-to-play collectible card game for PC and mobile devices developed by Nuverse and Second Dinner. 
Marvel calls it a “revolutionary game experience that unleashes the entire Marvel multiverse into a fast-paced, adrenaline-pumping card battle” that tasks players with assembling their ultimate Marvel dream team complete with both heroes and villains. To do so, players will need to collect “endless” card variants and use them in collectible card game plays. Each card game match lasts about three minutes. It is set to launch later this year. 


“Featuring 150+ iconic Marvel characters, Marvel Snap brings together stunning art from Marvel’s rich 80-year history with beautiful, brand new original illustrations to deliver hundreds of collectible art pieces in an intense player vs. player (PVP) fast-paced CCG,” a press release reads. “Marvel Snap introduces a new way to compete for the highest ranks, allowing players to ‘Snap’ to raise the stakes and double down. The mind games and bluffing inherent in this innovative mechanic create a game that is truly impossible to master.” 

At launch, Marvel Snap will feature more than 150 “unique cards,” and each will have multiple variations. According to the press release, each match will feature three of more than 50 random Marvel locations with game-changing effects. 

Beginning today, you can sign up for a limited edition closed beta on Android devices here. When the game launches later this year, it will be available in 13 different languages on PC and mobile devices. 
In regards to the development teams, Nuverse is perhaps best known for its work on mobile titles such as Sonic at the Olympic Games – Tokyo 2020, One Piece: Blood Routes, and Warhammer 40,000: Lost Crusade. Second Dinner is comprised of developers that have worked on Hearthstone, World of Warcraft, Halo, and more.

The delayed new-gen update for The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt will be released in Q4 of 2022. 
Back in April, CD Projekt Red announced that it had taken the development of a new-gen update for The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt in-house and that as a result of this shift, the update had been essentially indefinitely delayed. Following reports that the delay was in "development hell," CDPR put out a notice that this was not the case and now we know that the new-gen update will be released sometime in the final three months of this year.

Player First Games is well on its way to releasing its fighting game MultiVersus, a new multiplayer platform brawler that pits the extensive list of characters from the Warner Bros. catalog against one another in chaotic button-mashing battles. It's easy to compare MultiVersus to other fighting games in the genre, like Nintendo's juggernaut Super Smash Bros., but after spending a handful of hours throwing fists, kicks, and lasers with the WB crew, there's plenty that impressed me about MultiVersus that makes it stand out, and should be a game to …]]></summary>

What games are funny? Why, and how? Is it easier for games to be funny when they're not trying to be? Should self-described funny games be avoided entirely?
Because of this, we end up talking about Blorko again. We also nearly come to war about the difference between randomly improvising funny stuff and deciding that saying 'egg' a lot of is funny. There is a difference, but you know it when you see it. Matthew's life is like a sitcom, and also we apologise to Henry Cavill for forgetting his birthday. Sorry Henry. Please come on the show.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Few genres provide the simple pleasure of a good old-fashioned beat ‘em up. After all, these arcade-style games let you and your buddies punch and kick dozens of often colorful enemies in the face. What’s not to love? Double-teaming mobs of enemies or a sturdy boss strengthens bonds. Conversely, repeatedly grabbing health pick-ups “on accident” with a full health bar while your friend hangs on by a thread can reveal cracks in a relationship. Whatever side of the fence you’re on, we’ve all likely played these sorts of games, and the last decade has seen modernized takes on the winning formula. Here are 10 of the best contemporary beat ‘em ups (in no particular order) that you can play right now. No quarters necessary.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Spiders has announced GreedFall 2: The Dying World, a sequel to its 2019 role-playing game GreedFall.
The game takes place three years after the events of GreedFall. Players control a native of Teer Fradee, the first game’s island setting, who is captured and taken to the continent of Gacane. This nation is the home of the invading colonists, and it has fallen due to a combination of a deadly plague and political infighting between various factions. It’s up to you to prevent this unfamiliar land and your home from succumbing to disaster.


Like the first game, players can solve problems using diplomacy or aggression. Spiders also promises GreedFall 2 boasts new mechanics and more tactical combat but doesn’t elaborate on either bullet point. 
The studio currently has its hands full creating Steelrising, its French Revolution action RPG slated for September. Thus, GreedFall 2: The Dying World won’t arrive until 2024 for PC and unspecified consoles. 
The first GreedFall had cool ideas, but it ultimately left us wanting more. We’re curious to see how the sequel builds upon its solid foundation. You can read our GreedFall review here.]]></summary>

Mikami established Tango in 2010 after nearly two decades at Capcom, directing games like Resident Evil and Resident Evil 4, and a few years contracting for Platinum Games, where he directed Vanquish. His vision: give younger developers a chance to direct their own games and provide opportunities they might not get at other companies. Or, more bluntly, as he told Polygon in 2014, let people under 40 direct games.
“If you’re over 40, you’re somewhat out of touch with the people buying your games,” Mikami told the outlet, “and when you’re young, you don’t know enough about the industry. When you’re in your 30s, you have the right balance – you’re energetic and have your ego a…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Marvel has revealed that it is announcing a new game tomorrow, May 18. 
This news comes by way of a new tweet from the official Marvel Entertainment Twitter account, which teases the game in a quick 22-second video. As for when, Marvel says “Tune in tomorrow at 10 AM PST,” which means we’re already less than 24 hours away from finding out exactly what it is. You can check out the teaser below: 
New Game Announcement!

May 18, 2022
As you can see, we get a glimpse at America Chavez, who you might have just recently seen in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, Ironheart, who is getting her own Disney Plus series, and Venom. There also appears to be some Doombots or some kind of enemy minion related to Doctor Doom. However, the teaser ends with a splash screen with more than 100 Marvel character logos ranging from deeper cut characters like Blink and Quake to more mainstream ones such as Thanos and Wolverine. 
Elsewhere in the trailer, we see the Nuverse Logo and the Second Dinner logo, both game development studios. Nuverse is perhaps best known for its work on mobile titles such as Sonic at the Olympic Games – Tokyo 2020, One Piece: Blood Routes, and Warhammer 40,000: Lost Crusade. Second Dinner has worked on Hearthstone, World of Warcraft, Halo, and more. With this in mind, it might be possible that Marvel is teasing a mobile game considering both studios have a pedigree in that space. Of course, it could turn out to be a full console game too. Only time will tell for now but fortunately, you don’t have to wait too long. 
In the meantime, check out our list of upcoming superhero games and then read about why one Game Informer editor believes it’s time for Doctor Strange to get his own game. Check out Game Informer’s Marvel’s Midnight Suns hub for more information about that game, which might be out sooner than you think. 
What kind of game do you hope this new Marvel game is? Let us know what you think below!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Aloy is the star of Horizon Forbidden West – one of the best games of this year – and will soon shrink in size to forever be preserved as an adorable Nendoroid action figure. Slated to release this December, this figure comes with three face plates, allowing you to harness a little more realism, depending on what weapon or pose you put Aloy in. She stands at approximately 3.94 inches in height.
Along with the amazing game, Aloy has had a big year, making an appearance in Fortnite as a purchasable skin, and will likely be featured in the PlayStation VR2 game, Horizon: Call of the Mountain, which we hope hits in the months ahead.
If you are collector of game merchandise, Nendoroid has long been turning popular game leads into cute figures. Overwatch's Junkrat and D.Va, Bayonetta, and Hades' Zagreus are just a few of them that you can grab. You can find more about Aloy at Good Smiles' official site. You can see several images of the figure below:]]></summary>

        <updated>2022-05-18T18:28:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Test Drive Unlimited: Solar Crown has been bit by the delay bug. The game was scheduled to launch this September, but it’s been pushed to 2023. 
The long-awaited revival of the dormant racing franchise needs more time in the shop to polish up its systems, according to an update by publisher Nacon (thanks, Eurogamer). The statement reads in part: 
“With so much support from fans of the series, we know many of you will be disappointed, but our goal with Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown is to make it the most polished gaming experience in the franchise by spending more time on its development.” 
To soften the blow, the team announced plans to hold closed betas at some point in the future, giving players a chance to sit behind the wheel before launch. 
Nacon has also decided to cancel the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions of Solar Crown “with the aim of making the most of the technology in the latest consoles." You can now pick up the game on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC. Solar Crown joins Gotham Knights as another cross-generation title to abandon its planned last-gen ports in favor of maximizing the current-gen experience. 
Test Drive Unlimited: Solar Crown was first unveiled in 2020 and is the first entry in the franchise since 2012's Test Drive: Ferrari Racing Legends (although the last Unlimited game was Unlimited 2 in 2011). The game tasks racing fans with aligning themselves with one of two clans, The Streets and The Sharps, to compete in races across an expansive Hong Kong Island. Outside of races, players can explore and expand the headquarters of their chosen faction. 
2022 has seen several high-profile titles get pushed into the following year. You can check out the complete list of those games here.]]></summary>

There are plenty of games that fit into both of these categories joining the subscription service before the end of May, including Vampire Survivors, Hardspace: Shipbreaker, Sniper Elite 5 and Jurassic World Evolution 2.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft’s roller derby-inspired Roller Champions finally has a release date, and its inaugural season is only a week away.
On May 25, the free-to-play multiplayer title goes live. The game’s 3v3 contests combine skating, racing, and a bit of rugby. Teams skate around a track carrying a ball to toss through a goal for points. You can also earn additional points based on the number of laps you complete. Maintaining possession of the ball requires players to rough each other up using tackle moves and other attacks. Roller Champions ups the ante on real-life roller derby by letting players skate up and along walls and perform other over-the-top moves. 


As players rack up victories they’ll climb the ladder of a championship league to gain new stadiums, maps, and fans. Your Champion can be customized with unlockable items earned both in-game and through a season pass (dubbed a Roller Pass). A social hub fashioned as a skatepark allows friends and other players to meet up, practice, or indulge in mini-games. 
Roller Champions supports cross-play and cross-progression between PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC through the Ubisoft Store. The game is also playable on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S via backward compatibility. Ubisoft also plans to bring Roller Champions to Switch, Stadia, and Amazon Luna at a later date. 
Roller Champions was first announced during E3 2019 with a pre-alpha demo. You can watch us take that version of the game for a spin in this episode of New Gameplay Today.]]></summary>

As the title implies, I am not somebody who has ever really cared all that much about the Warcraft series or its MMO counterpart, World of Warcraft. I have memories of playing one of the Warcraft games back on a PC circa 2003, so it was probably Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos, but I never really followed the franchise beyond that. All of this is to set up and say that if you’re looking for what a hardcore Warcraft fan thinks of the series’ first venture into the mobile space in Warcraft Arclight Rumble, I’m not your guy. 
However, as someone who doesn’t care about Warcraft ... I’m really enjoying Warcraft Arclight Rumble. I can only speak on the gameplay to…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Time travel stories can have pretty high stakes, because usually you only travel in time when you really need to change something. A killer robot is trying to kill a lady because of something her son will eventually do, that kind of thing. My favourite episodes of Doctor Who, by contrast, were always the ones where the Doctor met a miserable dog-alien thousands of years in the future, and the dog alien is like "Not only is the planet about to blow, but my marriage is in trouble," and then the episode was mostly about the latter issue rather than the former. This is all by way of introduction to Eternal Threads, a puzzle game where you go back in time to stop everyone in a house share dying in a fire. 
To save a present that has been rendered apocalyptic by time travel itself, you are part of a team who go back and change tiny things in the past to fix it, in this case 2015. While it is imperative for some reason that the fire does indeed happen, it is just as important that all six occupants live. You can alter small decisions they make in the week running up to the fire, and so save their lives by choosing whether they go to the pub, if they comfort each other in times of need, or what they have arguments about. The beat of a butterfly's wing, indeed.

With its late summer release fast approaching, Volition recently showed off a larger chunk of some actual gameplay to press in another remote preview session. It looks almost exactly like what you'd expect it to look like: a fun open world game where you shoot people and smash cars into other cars.
Barring any catastrophic eventualities where this game actually ends up being just a load of bugs propping up other bugs in a fluorescent trenchcoat, I feel almost 100% confident in saying to you that this will be an enjoyable product when it comes out. But I also should be honest and say that the gameplay I saw has congealed into the same kind of sticky morass and blurred whirling lights in my memory as my first all-night benders. It's a big collage of colours and explosions, and words like "cops", "switch car" and "plan", leaving a general impression of fun but, so far, few specifics in its wake. And to be even more frank about it all, I can't think of a nailed on reason why any of it has to be a Saints Row game.

We had the pleasure of having the upcoming reboot of Saints Row on the cover of Game Informer issue #340 when I went hands-on with an early build of the game and spoke with the fine folks at Volition, the studio behind the series. Last week, the developer held a preview event, showing off where Saints Row is now, just a few months before launch. Much of what was shown was the same content as last year, but there were plenty of changes I noticed that have me feeling good about the direction this new Saints adventure is taking.

However, Acer will be making another attempt to take it semi-mainstream when it releases the Predator Helios 300 SpatialLabs Edition gaming laptop in September 2022. Its 15.6 screen, powered by an RTX 3080 and Intel Core i9-12900H CPU, promises both standard 2D at 4K and glasses-free stereoscopic 3D-o-vision. A bit like the Nintendo 3DS, only much more powerful, higher-res, and costing $3400 / €3299.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The first episode of Pokémon: Huisian Snow, a new limited web Pokémon series, is now live on YouTube.
It’s less than seven minutes long so it’s worth a watch for anyone who likes Pokémon, but it’s especially a must-watch for fans of this year’s Pokémon Legends: Arceus. That’s because as the name implies, it takes place in the Hisui region of Pokémon, which debuted in Legends: Arceus. It’s the ancient version of the Sinnoh region and most people there aren’t too keen to live alongside Pokémon like the trainers we’ve all battled against in the mainline games. That discrepancy is at the heart of the first episode of Pokémon: Hisuian Snow, "Onto the Icy Blue."
“Across the Hisui region, many grow up believing people and Pokémon cannot live together,” the YouTube description for Episode 1 reads. “But when Alec meets a Hisuian Zorua, he may need to rethink how he views Pokémon.” 


We won’t spoil here what happens, but you can check out the episode above. It’s a great start to Pokémon: Hisuian Snow and its beautiful art already has me on the lookout for the next episode. 
After watching it, read Game Informer’s Pokémon Legends: Arceus review and then read about the recent Daybreak update for the game. Check out the three starters for the next generation of Pokémon in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet after that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From the 90s onwards, movies taught me that vampires spend all their time eating and having sex with people (often concurrently). Vampire: The Masquerade - Swansong has taught me that they actually spend most of their time walking around looking at things, sometimes stopping to have tense conversations or pick up keycards. There is occasional eating.
This is probably because the three vampires you play as in Swansong aren't exactly on their down-time. Set in Boston in 2019, you begin in medias res after a sudden violent attack on a party has left the Boston vampire court reeling. The Prince, an Annie Lennox cosplayer called Hazel Iverson, has called three of her most trusted lieutenants in to firstly check on the immediate aftermath, and thereafter investigate the wider fallout and strike against whodunnit. Since developers Big Bad Wolf are the folks behind The Council, the role you take isn't an action hero but different shades of spy and/or detective. Neither leaves you much time to loaf about being all sexy, though.

Vampires secretly walk among us. They drive fast cars. Lord above us in penthouses. And are so refined in their tastes, they bite our wrists gently when feeding, hopefully keeping us alive for future snacks. Vampire: The Masquerade – Swansong explores the nightwalkers' place in our world through a nicely designed narrative lens that embraces player choice in deep and satisfying ways.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Final Fantasy VII Remake director Tetsuya Nomura has revealed that Square Enix has news to share in regards to the Final Fantasy VII franchise next month. 
Nomura said this in a Japanese live stream about Final Fantasy VII: The First Soldier, a mobile battle royale, as reported by Video Games Chronicle. As for what this Final Fantasy VII news will be, it could theoretically be anything related to the franchise including The First Soldier, the original FFVII and its subsequent rereleases, Final Fantasy VII Ever Crisis, or possibly (hopefully) news about Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 2. 
The last we heard about Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 2 was that it could “differ significantly” from the original, which wouldn’t be surprising considering the changes and additions made in Final Fantasy VII Remake compared to the original game’s first handful of hours. In an ideal world, we hear about Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 2 next month and then we hear about Final Fantasy XVI soon after, especially considering producer Naoki Yoshida recently revealed it’s near the end of development. 
All of this would tie into a tease from a new Final Fantasy 35th Anniversary website that launched in March. It not only celebrates the series’ history, but teases information on upcoming titles, too. Upcoming titles could include Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 2, Final Fantasy VII Ever Crisis, or even Final Fantasy XVI. Only time will for now. 
While waiting to learn more, read Game Informer’s Final Fantasy VII Remake review and then read about how Final Fantasy XVI has an “expansive” skill tree, according to its producer. Check out Game Informer’s ranking of every mainline Final Fantasy game after that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Disney has unveiled the first trailer for She-Hulk: Attorney at Law, the upcoming Marvel series that premieres on Disney+ this August.
Jennifer Walters (Tatiana Maslany) is a lawyer juggling an increasingly chaotic life, including working for a newly launched superhuman law division. Her cousin also happens to be Bruce Banner, AKA the Hulk. Walters gains a measure of the gamma radiation fueling Bruce to become a green powerhouse in her own right to smash evil in and out of the courtroom. The cast includes Mark Ruffalo, Jameela Jamill, and Tim Roth (reprising his role as Abomination). 


You can also check out the official poster below:
She-Hulk made her comic debut in 1980 and, like her cousin, possesses superhuman strength, speed, stamina, healing, and durability. One of the most significant differences between Hulk and She-Hulk is that Jennifer largely retains her personality and intelligence while green, though usually with fewer inhibitions, as showcased at the end of the trailer. She’s traditionally portrayed as a skilled hand-to-hand fighter (trained by Captain America, among others), meaning she usually has far more finesse and is less destructive in a fight than Banner. Sometimes. 
She-Hulk: Attorney at Law consists of nine episodes and premieres on August 17 on Disney+. It serves as the third Marvel TV series for 2022, following Moon Knight and the upcoming Ms. Marvel, which begins streaming in June.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today’s reveal of Hooked on You: A Dead by Daylight Dating Sim has unsurprisingly and understandably elicited a mixture of surprise, confusion, and flat-out ridicule. I won’t tell anyone that either emotion is invalid, but I do take exception to the sentiment that established franchises should stay in their lane and aren’t allowed to stretch their wings to other genres. After all, several of the best games and even series were spawned when their creators flexed an IP’s versatility. So before you write off a Dead by Daylight visual novel, here are just a few examples – not a definitive list or ranking – of other wild spin-offs that became big success stories in their own right.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today’s Dead by Daylight 6th Anniversary livestream brought a lot of exciting announcements, but none were stranger or more surprising than the reveal of Hooked on You. This wild spin-off surgically removes Dead by Daylight’s terrifying killers and plops them into the romantic bubblegum world of dating sims.
If you’ve ever longed to court The Huntress after she brutally slaughtered you, Hooked on You: A Dead by Daylight Dating Sim is the game you’ve been waiting for. Launching later this year, this visual novel tasks would-be lovers to flirt their way into the hearts of four Killers: The Wraith, The Spirit, The Huntress, and The Trapper. Through choice-driven conversations, you’ll forge friendships or steamy relationships with these monsters to learn their personal histories and uncover the broader stories of what got them here in the first place. 


“You wanted it? You got it! Hooked on You: A Dead by Daylight Dating Sim mixes horror, humor and romance to create a fresh way for fans to interact and create an emotional bond with their favorite Killers,” says Mathieu Côté, Head of Partnerships for Dead by Daylight. “Our goal with our first visual novel is to provide fans with a completely unique and surprising new way to experience the world of Dead by Daylight.”
Hooked on You: A Dead by Daylight Dating Sim comes from Psyop, the team behind the equally silly KFC dating sim I Love You, Colonel Sanders! A Finger Lickin’ Good Dating Simulator. It doesn’t have a release date, but it’s coming to Steam sometime this summer.]]></summary>

The sting of another death fades as I attempt to shake off my nerves. I’m preparing to clash with a Sanguimancer I’ve tried to slay a dozen times. Maybe I’ll learn something new as I dash back into the fray, though I’ve been down this path many times on prior hunts, and I know I’m more likely to survive on sheer luck than anything else. Salt and Sacrifice often leaves me lacking a feeling of accomplishment and, in the process, sullies the promising additions like its bounties and crafting systems.

Among the many graphs that Finnbogason presented to the Eve faithful during his Fanfest keynote in Reykjavík this year, one was a colourful standout. It showed Eve Online’s learning curve as a comedy cliff face, so steep that it turned back on itself. Stickmen tumbled from its peak, while others were crucified or hanged from the curve’s mantel - killed by Eve’s notoriously cruel new player experience. It earned a laugh of grim recognition from the audience, all survivors of that terrible climb.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Techland, the studio behind this year’s Dying Light 2 Stay Human, has revealed the first look at its unannounced fantasy RPG that’s now in development. 
The game, which does not yet have a title, is officially being referred to as a “AAA open-world action-RPG in a fantasy setting,” and today’s concept art reveal highlights just that. Featuring luscious greenery, ancient ruins, and plenty of beautiful waterfalls, it seems this fantasy RPG will be quite the looker if the concept art is any indication. Techland released the concept art below as a way to let developers know that the studio is hiring and that dozens of positions are open for work on this RPG. 
Techland says the development team is led by key figures behind some of the "biggest RPGs in modern history," including the narrative di…]]></summary>

Stray Blade was first touted on the Xbox stream at last year’s Gamescom but it’s been in development for several years at the Berlin-based developers. The game stars an anthropologist who’s been sucked through a magic portal and dumped in the ‘Valley of Acrea’ with a little scarf-wearing wolf called Boji for company.

The CPU's only major drawback on launch was its price: £280. Now, the Ryzen 5 5600X is retailing for just £185 at Currys in the UK when you use the code FNDDGAMING, bringing a heretofore unseen level of performance to this price point.

Middling art sits atop a generic description that does its very best to not sell the game. "Hunt for blood in nearby settlements... conquer the land of the living." Alrighteyyy, then. Screenshots show what could be any other isometric RPG like Path Of Exile or something – anything.
So, you dive in expecting an average time. One characterised by little more than two palms on the knees once you've closed it down, then a big stand and a wordless stretch. But no! V Rising is the opposite of average; it should be renamed V-ERY GOOD Rising. Forget the art, the description, the screenshots. Just give it a shot.

Trying to join in with any online multiplayer game has been met with quotes such as, "What on earth are you doing?" and, "Wow, 84 deaths? Really?", to name but a few. This led to scenarios where it felt far easier for me to give up and try something new. But when the point of the game is to continue dying over and over again to up my knowledge, skill level, abilities and unlock new weapons and perks? There I have found a place for my unending death and incompetence in Supergiant's Hades.

The news came as part of Mediatonic’s announcement that Fall Guys is coming to Nintendo Switch and Xbox next month with full cross-play and cross-progression support, alongside its current homes on PC and PlayStation.

I cannot remember any of the rules of poker, but I do really like the feel of cards, the shick schick shick of shuffling them and all the business of moving them around in your hand as if that'll change things very much. Card Shark, the latest game from the Reigns devs Nerial, is an ideal card game for me, as it does all the noises of shuffling and dealing and collecting cards extremely well, without requiring any knowledge or memory of the games its punters are actually playing. 
Instead, Card Shark is all about the palming and stacking and counting of cards, rather than an actual card game like your classic deckbuilders and such like. It will be out in full on June 2nd, but last week I got to play a larger version of the current Steam demo - about four hours worth of it, in fact - and I discovered that while I'm very bad at card games, I am pretty good at (pretend) cheating at them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To some people, I would describe 20 Minutes Till Dawn as "like Vampire Survivors but you actually aim and attack." To others, I might say it's "similar to Crimsonland or Nation Red." Either way, it's a top-down survival shoot 'em up about blasting through Lovecraftian horrors using your trusty gun, levelling up to get magical perks and powers, and yes, grabbing a load of XP gems. A free demo is out now, and I'm enjoying it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Another Crab's Treasure is in some ways the most grimdark Soulslike yet. It's about a cute crab battling other crabs at the bottom of a colourful sea, sure, but the different shells and the weapons you and your enemies are wielding are made from trash dumping into that colourful sea by humans.

It's still cute, though. There's a reveal trailer below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this week, Activision Blizzard published a post on their website about their "Diversity Space Tool". Developed by subsidiary King, it's a tool for rating video game characters along certain axes in order to rate their relative diversity. Several people then pointed out that sounded mildly dystopian.

Yesterday, Activison Blizzard responded, saying that the "prototype is not being used in active game development", and was designed as an optional supplement to other work.

Today, musicians from across Europe and beyond come together to give it their all, with varying degrees of catchiness, camp, and drama. Honestly, this year's contest better be amazing, considering some great songs have already been knocked out before the finals. I was particularly surprised by the loss of Austria's pop goths and Latvia's song with the most surprising obscene opening line in pop history. If that's the quality of song being rejected, they BETTER NOT have any boring junk in the finals. But we have hours to fill until Eurovision starts, so what are you playing this weekend?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[AMD’s FSR 2.0 upscaler is out now – in only one game, Deathloop, but still. This is a big moment for the heavily upgraded FSR (FidelityFX Super Resolution), as it’s basically attempting to fight Nvidia’s rival DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling) with some of its own tactics. There’s none of Nvidia’s machine learning enhancements, but whereas FSR 1.0 was a simple spatial upscaler – meaning data used for upscaling a frame could only come from within the frame itself – FSR 2.0 uses a temporal upscaling technique similar to that of DLSS. This allows it to draw data from previous frames as well, producing a sharper, higher-quality image. 


The lack of machine learning also has the upside of keeping FSR 2.0, like FSR 1.0, compatible with any reasonably recent gaming GPU. Nvidia may make most of this generation’s best graphics cards, but you won't need something brand new and super powerful to let FSR 2.0 boost your frame rates. To find out how well it works, compared to both DLSS and FSR 1.0, I reinstalled Deathloop and gave all three upscalers a whirl.

Despite appearances, it's quite mildly roguelike, and those of you who dig a complex strategic challenge or skin of your teeth type survival story aren't quite the right audience. This one is a more forgiving affair, and yet not easy or simply enough that I ever got bored. It's a good time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Lego games I'm most familiar with are the licensed property games - yer Lego Indiana Joneses and yer Lego Star Warses where you run around a continuous level smashing things. Lego Bricktales is more akin to last year's extremely cute geometric puzzler Lego Builder's Journey, in that you're exploring detailed, colourful brick dioramas, and solving puzzles by bulding things out of titular hot-property block. In Bricktales, though, it's way more granular. You're whisked away into a separate building screen to construct and stress test things like bridges and beams to support a platform, for example. You have a set number of different shaped and sized bricks to work with.
From playing a preview build of the first level - a jungle, home to some lost explorers - the thing that impresses me most about Bricktales is just how much it's like building things with actual Lego. It sounds stupid to say, but them little bricks are really astonishingly realised. It all looks so much Lego it's sort of surprising that you can't reach through the screen and pick it up. It's amazing. It's the closest thing to Lego you can get outside of actual Lego - which is the problem. It just kind of makes you miss Lego.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Funcom announced back in 2019 that they planned to make Dune games based on Frank Herbert's sci-fi spice and sandworms novels. They followed through by releasing 4X strategy game Dune: Spice Wars last month, and now it seems they're ramping up development on a new open world survival game set in the Dune universe.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's presumably less pressure to keep every scrap of information secret when the game you're developing is a remake. EA Motive seem to be taking advantage of that by releasing lots of behind-the-scenes, in-development videos and streams of their work on the Dead Space remake. Then, occasionally in those streams, they offer some news. Back in March, they let it be known during a deep dive into the remake's audio that the game would release in early 2023. Now, during a livestream about the game's art, they've announced the specific release date: January 27th, 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You could fairly think of the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 Ti as a big, stump-necked brute of a graphics card. What better characterisation for the latest tippity-top-of-the-line GPU from Nvidia, who’ve already produced the best graphics card for 4K in the RTX 3080? But rather than be overwhelmed by its power, I personally feel more like the RTX 3090 Ti is trying to trick, tempt and seduce me, Old Testament-style. “Recommend meeeee” it whispers, coasting through another maximum settings benchmark. “Tell evvvvvvveryone these frame rates are totally worth £1879.”


But I can’t. Sorry. While I am a sucker for go-faster gear, the RTX 3090 Ti is just too far of a stretch, with its sometimes imperceptible performance differences to the £1399 RTX 3090 and a tendency towards impractically gigantic partner card models.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We're going macro this week, so we're talking about the best writing in video games. This is a very broad topic for discussion, so that means I also get to say 'ludonarrative dissonance' (we also describe 'ludonarrative harmony' as its opposite). Please don't let this put you off, though, because we do talk about some bloody well good games.
The times being what they are, though, results in us having a long discussion of patter theft, because some dreadful American (we assume) stole the "It's me, Blorko!" tweet and then just did a much worse version of it. Hang your head in shame, whoever you are. I also went to a first communion party and ate a lot of cake, and had a run in with a very charismatic toddler who may or may not be evil.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Leave the doormat outside long enough in Age Of Darkness: Final Stand and you might not live to see the morning. If the game’s grimdark aesthetic didn’t warn you, here’s another from me directly: this game is brutal. Be mentally prepared to start over, over and over again. The “one more round” syndrome is strong with this mashup of tower defense and strategy.


The game’s premise is simple: survive. While the standard survival mode is challenging enough to warrant hours of gameplay, Age Of Darkness’s modifiers let you amp up the carnage for a nightmarish good time. See those little creatures all over your screen like bees in an unstable hive? Now picture building a settlement over them.

The book isn't due to be published until early next year, but does this mean the Doom movie from 2005 starring Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson is technically Romero’s biopic? Did The Rock not want to wear a wig? I’m very confused.

While this is arguably a poor use of my time, I enjoy the process—and technically it is productive.

So let's talk about the work which went into producing one (1) screenshot and 43 seconds of video for last week's post about the Morrowind modder who added the family cat because their kids were afraid of mudcrabs.
