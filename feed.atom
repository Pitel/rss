Update: Now that the game is available on North American and European Switch eShops, we're republishing this review of the import version from February 2023.

CAVE Co. Ltd, the pioneering, god-tier arcade developer that reignited the shooting game genre in the '90s, has a portfolio to die for. After 17 years of cast-iron quality and unceasing invention, the sound of gunfire finally rang silent in 2012 with their swansong, Dodonpachi SaiDaiOuJou.

We first heard that the gorgeous ex-battler Thirsty Suitors would be coming to Switch in Annapurna Interactive's 2022 showcase, but now, one year on, the game appeared in this year's presentation and served up a release date of 2nd November to boot.
The all-new trailer does a pretty good job of showing the kind of action that will be in store, and we'll do our best to summarise it for you here too. Developed by Outerloop Games, Thirsty Suitors is a story-driven adventure game where you play as Jala, our young protagonist, who returns to her family home only to find her relationships in disarray. Her sister isn't talking to her, her parents seem disappointed, oh, and all of her exes are out to either fight and/or flirt with her — that last one feels important.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over a decade on from its Nintendo DS release, there's still nothing quite like Ghost Trick. In this smart murder mystery detective game from the creator of Ace Attorney, you play the recently deceased amnesiac Sissel as he attempts to piece together his own demise. Who killed him? And why? And what's the deal with these newfound powers he has to turn back time and manipulate inanimate objects in his vicinity? That definitely wasn't in the ghostbusting 101 manual. Alas, he doesn't have long to find out, as he'll cross over to the afterlife in the morning. Thus begins a frantic night of whodunnit puzzling at its finest, with director Shu Takumi showing us exactly what he's made of outside the courtroom dramas he built his name on.

As a result, legislation beyond copyright infringement is likely to play a key role in tackling piracy moving forward. The French government's current plan for tackling online harms envisions state-operated domain blocking lists being injected directly into web browsers to prevent fraud. It's a well-intentioned move but will not stop there.

Niantic CEO John Hanke told employees and fans how the company had decided to "narrow" its focus on certain mobile game investments. NBA All-World will be sunset and production on Marvel: World of Heroes will come to a halt.

        <updated>2023-06-29T23:00:22.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There is an Xbox version, but it needs more time
Today, Larian Studios announced that it's moving up the release date of Baldur's Gate 3 on PC and slightly delaying the PS5 version. Alongside those platforms, the studio says an Xbox version of Baldur's Gate 3 is still in the works. It's just a matter of getting it ready.
In a community update around the announcement, Larian said it's optimistic about Baldur's Gate 3 on the Xbox Series X. But in order to announce and release on Xbox, the studio will need to "ensure the game is performing without compromise across the entire Xbox X|S ecosystem."
Essentially? "Like with the PS5 version, we'll release it when it's ready," Larian said. "We'll update you as soon as we can."
Splitting the screens
Larian head Swen Vincke went into more detail about the status of the Xbox version in an interview with IGN. Vincke noted both the freedom of the game itself, and the split-screen co-op, as causes for its troubles. Vincke told IGN that Larian may have to make some "compromises" to get an Xbox version live, though he didn't specify what they were, and didn't want to confirm that would be the case for-sure.
Vincke also confirms that Larian is working with Microsoft's Xbox Advanced Technology Group (Microsoft did not respond to a request for comment on the matter to IGN).
As the interview goes on, Vincke does say that the team's ambition is to release Baldur's Gate 3 on Xbox Series X|S this year, but it can't commit to that. Again, it's ready when it's ready.
"This one's not exclusive. You're going to be able to play it. It's just a matter of patience. This is really a question of time," Vincke said.
As for PC and PS5 players, the wait for Baldur's Gate 3 has shifted a bit with today's news. PC players will get the massive RPG on August 3, while PS5 players have to wait just a little bit longer for September 6.

Following up on the Danganronpa series was always going to be a tricky proposition. With its deceptively simple 'Killing Game' premise, its huge cast of eclectic characters, and its often overwhelmingly macabre atmosphere, it’s no wonder Spike Chunsoft’s visual novel franchise became such a hit with players worldwide.
Naturally, the temptation with a spiritual successor is to go bigger and bolder, and that’s exactly what developers Too Kyo Games and Spike Chunsoft have strived for with Master Detective Archives: Rain Code. And make no mistake, it’s absolutely a spiritual successor to Danganronpa in our eyes; while Rain Code differs fundamentally in how you navigate the environment and interact with its inhabitants, both require you to use your keen detective skills to solve a series of gruesome murders.

Bloober Team has worked on a few different psychological horror titles, like Layers of Fear, The Medium, and the upcoming Silent Hill 2 remake. But now the studio has announced they're moving in a somewhat different direction.
In a new Endgadget interview, Bloober's co-founder Piotr Babieno stated that 2023 is the end of Bloober's foray into psychological horror.
"This year is like closing the era of making psychological horror games," Babieno said. “Right now we are going into Bloober Team 3.0, making mass-market horror.”
According to Engadget's piece, Bloober will rely on "action" and "player input", which Bloober hopes will expand its audience.

The Steam Summer Sale 2023 is officially live, offering deep discounts on hundreds of games across the Steam platform. From now until July 23 at 10 a.m. PT, tons of games have gone on sale. There's AAA titles, indie games, and everything in between.
While previous Summer Sales have often featured a fun little mini-game, it doesn't look like there's one this year. Instead, The Points Shop features a special Summer in the City section with new cosmetics for your Steam profile.

As of writing, these are the biggest discounts we've seen for the 256GB and 512GB models of the handheld. All options come with a carrying case, with the two more expensive models utilizing the faster NVMe SSD storage.

As part of the Annapurna Showcase 2023, the publisher has revealed that Thirsty Suitors will be arriving on November 2, 2023.
Initially revealed back in 2021, Thirsty Suitors is a stylish mash-up of so many things. Coming to us from developer Outerloop Games, it takes skateboarding, combat, and cooking and drops them into a slice-of-life casserole. “Battle your exes, disappoint your parents, find yourself,” the trailer says. Yeah, I can totally relate to all of those things on a nauseatingly deep level. It’s all about going back home and seeing familiar faces again. That sounds like hell! Count me in!
https://youtu.be/4LIj46_R62M
There’s a lot here, so it’s fortunate that Destructoid’s very own Eric “Peachfuzz” Van Allen went toe-to-toe with its demo last year. I’m still not entirely sure what to make of this whole thing, but Thirsty Suitors looks pretty awesome. It brings together relatable themes gussied up with some irresistible weirdness. I don’t know what I’m looking at, but I am entirely on board. There's currently a demo that you can check out if, like me, you are curious about what this game has to offer.
Thirst Suitors releases for PlayStation, Xbox, PC, and Switch platforms November 2, 2023.

Niantic, the mobile developer known for games like Pokémon Go and Pikmin Bloom, is making some big cuts. The company is shuttering its Los Angeles office, closing down NBA All-World, cancelling an upcoming Marvel project, and laying off roughly 230 employees.

"The mobile gaming market is very mature and only the best and most differentiated titles have a chance to succeed," Hanke said.
Specifically, Niantic is closing its LA studio and reducing the game platform team, alongside reductions across the company, which will result in "around 230" employees laid off. NBA Al…]]></summary>

As part of the Annapurna Showcase today, the publisher unveiled Blade Runner 2033: Labyrinth. Alongside it, they’ve dropped a trailer that shows practically nothing, but I still want it right now.
Blade Runner 2033: Labyrinth is coming from Annapurna Interactive’s internal development team. Set between the original movie and Blade Runner 2049. It occurs after the Great Blackout depicted in Blade Runner Black Out 2022. You’re cast as a retired Blade Runner who is doing… something.
https://youtu.be/QCgmRTexkEU
Details are sparse! We see the aesthetics that make the franchise so memorable, and there’s some spooky narration, but not much else. That's good enough for me! The only additional details I can find are on the Steam page, which has the tags “Adventure,” “Exploration,” and “Investigation,” but nothing else really solid. I guess we’ll have to wait and see. Dammit.
In the meantime, I can catch up on some of the Blade Runner flicks. I've only really watched the first film.
Blade Runner 2033: Labyrinth is currently slated for PC and “console.” There’s no release window, but it will probably be within the next decade. It would be really weird to see it actually released in 2033 or after.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Annapurna Interactive have announced their first internally developed game at their publishing showcase this evening, and it's an all-new Blade Runner game. Exciting! It's called Blade Runner 2033: Labyrinth, and it's set "squarely between" the original Blade Runner film and its more recent sequel, Blade Runner 2049, say Annapurna. The reveal trailer doesn't give too much away at this stage, but I'm getting very big Her Story and Immortality vibes from it. Come and have a gander below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tonight's Annapurna Interactive Showcase brought us 30 minutes of fresh game announcements, putting a lovely (and hopefully final) full stop on this year's notE3 / Summer Game Fest period. While most of the announcements were updates on games we already knew about, there are a couple of cool new things in there that I'm personally quite pumped for, including a new Blade Runner game being developed internally at Annapurna Interactive, a new Keita Takahashi joint about a kid stuck in a T-pose of all things, and a new ghostly biking game from the team behind Nidhogg. I'd highly recommend watching the showcase in full if you can, but in case you need a quick refresher of what happened, or are just short on time, we've rounded up every announcement in order below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[JACKPOT! JACKPOT! JACKPOT!
Loot your change drawer, Zen Studios has confirmed that Pinball FX is going to drop on Switch next week. July 6, 2023, to be precise.
To be clear, this is the–I don’t know–reboot of Pinball FX. Because they got up to Pinball FX3 and then decided to start the sequence over. This is especially interesting because you can already get Pinball FX3 on Switch. Pinball FX is kind of built from the ground up in Unreal Engine 4. I’m not sure why that’s necessary, but it means that your tables don’t carry over from the previous Pinball FX games. That kind of puts a damper on things.
https://youtu.be/GSZYXzYaEaw
But, hey, it’s free to play. You get a one-day pass to try out everything. Afterward, you’re left with three tables you can play in unlimited fashion: West Rampage, Fish Tales, and Sorcerer's Lair. Tables after that are bought a la carte, or in small bundles. Other versions allow you to buy pinball coins or a pinball pass as another way of playing, but this won’t initially be part of the Switch version. The Switch is getting 21 tables that the platform hasn’t had before, so that’s something.
I still feel scorned by the fact that Zen Studios got their hands on the Williams and Bally licenses, which were previously held by Farsight Studios for their game, Pinball Arcade. I loved Pinball Arcade because it felt like it was trying to be extremely faithful to the tables. It was kneecapped after losing those licenses and never recovered. However, Zen Studios seems to have gotten better about their authenticity, so maybe I’ll eventually finally migrate. It just still hurts, you know?
Pinball FX is currently available for PlayStation, Xbox, and PC platforms. It releases on Switch July 6, 2023.

It even unveiled its first-ever first-party game. We have all that and more in our breakdown below. 
Here’s everything announced during the 2023 Annapurna Interactive Showcase
While the showcase featured plenty of updates about games we’re already excited about, it also featured four new game reveals.

        <updated>2023-06-29T19:29:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Annapurna Interactive has revealed Blade Runner 2033: Labyrinth, a new game set in the same world as the Blade Runner film series, and it's the first game developed in-house. 
Annapurna has published plenty of great games, but it announced last year that it had created a new internal studio to actually develop one. And now we know that game is Blade Runner 2033: Labyrinth. As the name suggests, it takes place in 2033, which puts it between the original film and its sequel, Blade Runner 2049. Blade Runner 2033: Labyrinth takes place in a dystopian Los Angeles like its cinematic predecessors, and the game's events occur after the Blackout hits. 
Not much else was revealed about the game, but you can check out its moody cinematic trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, this game looks very Blade Runner, and we can't wait to learn more about it. Blade Runner 2033: Labyrinth's development is led by game director Chelsea Hash, who previously served as the director of Solar Ash and technical art lead on What Remains of Edith Finch. 
Annapurna Interactive says Blade Runner 2033: Labyrinth is the first new Blade Runner game for consoles and PC in development in 25 years. It's due out sometime in the future on consoles and PC, but there's no word on when to expect it. However, Annapurna Interactive says it will share more details about the game soon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Thirsty Suitors will be released on PlayStation, Xbox (including Xbox Game Pass), Switch, and PC on November 2, it's been revealed. 
This news comes by way of today's Annapurna Interactive Showcase, where developer Outerloop Games released a new trailer showing off more of what to expect in this RPG that's one part a skateboarding game, another part a cooking game, and always a game about confronting your exes and parents. It looks great – we quite enjoyed playing it recently during Summer Game Fest 2023 – and you can check it out for yourself below in the newest Thirsty Suitors trailer: 


As you can see, players take on the role of protagonist Jala, who, after a bad breakup, returns to her hometown. There, she must confront her exes and try to reconcile with them, please her tough-to-please parents, and mend broken friendships in time for her sister's wedding. To do all that, Jala will skateboard, take part in turn-based combat seemingly inspired by Persona and Pokémon, cook meals with her parents, and more. 
Thirsty Suitors hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC via Steam on November 2.

In the game, you control a small beetle-like creature as you traverse through a mysterious alien world using strange orbs that they themselves are worlds you can dive into. 
Check out Cocoon in action in the trailer below:

Among the new additions: car crashes, much improved pathfinding, and car parks. I find all of these as exciting as each other.

Square Enix revealed that Final Fantasy XVI has already sold 3 million copies across both physical and digital formats. Even though that's a bit behind the start that Final Fantasy XV had, it's important to highlight some key differences between the two launches.
https://twitter.com/finalfantasyxvi/status/1674016160306823170
For starters, the newly released action-RPG is currently PlayStation 5 exclusive. According to the trailers leading up to release, this exclusivity will last for at least six months. Meanwhile, Final Fantasy XV initially launched on both PlayStation and Xbox consoles, expanding its potential audience. It's easy to imagine that Final Fantasy XVI would see even more sales were it available on other platforms.

Fractal Projects has opened the case to reveal their next action-packed inventory management game, Save Room: The Merchant. It’s more Resident Evil 4 flavor, with less fat!
If you’re unfamiliar with 2022’s Save Room, so am I. It’s an inventory management puzzle game based on the best part of 2005’s Resident Evil 4: the inventory. The goal was to arrange the various oddly-shaped objects into the limited space of the inventory case.
Save Room: The Merchant shifts the concept closer to the Resident Evil 4 singularity. You’re made to think outside the case as you purchase items from the legally-distinct merchant character to prepare for the rigors of a level. You just need to make sure your adventurer has everything they need while trying to balance your pocketbook. There will be 40 bespoke levels that promise “relaxing music and sound effects.”
[caption id="attachment_389499" align="alignnone" width="640"] Image via Fractal Projects[/caption]
Save Room was something of an indie darling, so it’s great to see it continue on its legally-distinct way. I’m not as organization-obsessed as some gamers, but I do like optimization, so I’d probably enjoy it. You probably would too.
Save Room: The Merchant is currently targeting PC, but no release window has been mentioned.

Ever since 2004, EA Sports' annualized Madden NFL series has been the exclusive franchise for the NFL, its teams, stadiums, and players. The result was the closure of other franchises, such as the competitive NFL 2K series, as well as the arcade-focused NFL Blitz franchise (which was later acquired by EA in 2011). The recently announced Wild Card Football from Saber Interactive, part of the Playgrounds franchise, hopes to smash through the established line to give players a fresh 7-on-7 arcade-facing take on the sport starring their favorite players.

        <updated>2023-06-29T15:55:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While game delays have become commonplace, the opposite is extremely rare. Today, we learned Baldur's Gate 3 is somehow doing both at the same time. Initially planned for August 31, developer Larian Studios is advancing the PC release date to August 3 while delaying the PS5 version to September 6. According to the most recent community update, the change was done to prioritize release in order of platform readiness. More specifically, the team needed a little more time to get the PS5 version up to 60 frames per second.
"The PlayStation 5 version will be released roughly a week later than its originally scheduled date of August 31st," the community update reads. "Baldur’s Gate 3 is targeting 60 frames-per-second and we’re close to achieving that on the platform but need a bit more extra time. We don’t want to compromise on quality, and feel it would be a shame to downscale to 30fps or make other compromises to hit an arbitrary date."
Meanwhile, the PC version has moved up a whopping four weeks. Larian says, "This means the PC version of Baldur’s Gate 3 will be released at a time where you’ll have more time to play it," likely in reference to the release of Starfield, Bethesda's massive upcoming open-world RPG. By releasing their game over a month earlier, it's a little less likely that gamers would have to choose one or the other to devote their time to.
The community update also casts a light cantrip on some of the features coming to the full game, including new spells, the addition of feats, the Half-Orc and Dragonborn races, the monk class, and a huge line-up of new subclasses, which you can see listed below.

Baldur's Gate 3 is moving up its launch date by almost a month for PC players. Larian Studios announced that Baldur's Gate 3 will come to PC on August 3 now, while the PlayStation 5 version will launch a week later than expected on September 6.
Originally, Baldur's Gate 3 was set for August 31 on both PC and PS5. However, with an increasingly busy late-summer launch window, it looks like Larian isn't holding onto Baldur's Gate 3 for longer than it needs to.
"Reaching a technical bar that matches our design ambitions felt like the right move, while holding back the PC version when we knew we’d be ready felt like the wrong move in such a busy launch period," said Michael Douse, director of publishing.

Horror specialist Bloober Team is currently hard at work on a remake of Silent Hill 2 in collaboration with Konami, but that hasn't stopped the developer from releasing its 2021 psychological horror The Medium on the Switch.
The only downside - and it's a big one - is that it's a Cloud Version. This means, of course, that you'll need a reasonably fast and stable internet connection if you have any hope of experiencing the game as it was originally intended. As ever, the eShop listing encourages you to try out the free demo and test out the quality before committing to purchasing the full game.

From the little that we know so far, side quests, local and online co-op, and character upgrades have also been promised alongside the chance to interact with a number of familiar faces from the anime series.

Turnip Boy has already got away with tax evasion, but apparently, our raucous root vegetable is still up to his usual tricks, if today's announcement is anything to go by. That's right — Turnip Boy Commits Tax Evasion is getting a sequel, and it's coming to Switch later this year, developer Snoozy Kazoo and publisher Graffiti Games have announced.
Turnip Boy Robs a Bank was announced last year for PC and Xbox Game Pass, but we're happy to exclusively reveal that the game has now been confirmed for a Switch release at the same time. While the original game had some clear inspiration, Turnip Boy gets a bit more violent — and risky — with this follow-up, combining top-down adventure elements with roguelite gameplay. All in the name of robbing the bank.

Thursday 29th June 2023 marks the 25th anniversary of Banjo-Kazooie's release on Nintendo 64. To celebrate a quarter-century of Rare's archetypal and much-chronicled 'collectathon' platformer — one of the finest games on the system by our estimations — we've assembled the following list of every 3D platformer on N64, as ranked by you. Breeee!

The launch of Super Mario 64 ushered in what is now commonly referred to as the Golden Age of 3D platformers. In the years before the arrival of online gaming when first-person shooters came to dominate the console landscape for a period, these colourful solo experiences represented the medium's adventures into a new frontier, with freedom of movement and worldbuilding potential never before seen.

First announced back in 2021, and originally due to arrive as part of Tomb Raider's 25th-anniversary celebrations before being delayed, The Lara Croft Collection has finally rappelled its way onto Switch. This pair of spin-offs may not carry the main series' full moniker, but they are resolutely full-blooded Tomb Raider experiences that arrive on Nintendo's console in fine form, give or take a few performance issues and necessary excisions.
Before we dig into the issues, though, let's concentrate on what's great here, as there are plenty of positive things to say about both of these lovingly-crafted isometric adventures. Kicking off with 2010's Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light, and we vividly remember being pretty blown away by what Crystal Dynamics served us up with this one on ye olde Xbox Arcade all those years ago.

Yes, it may only be June, but that doesn't mean that the schedule for the winter months isn't filling up already. Today, Universal Studios Japan has joined in the planning, as it announced a special 'Pokémon Halloween Party' for, erm, Halloween.
But what will the event entail? you might ask, well, we're not exactly sure yet. What we do know is that DJ Pikachu and DJ Gengar will feature at the party and the official art showcases both of them in swanky new outfits — might there be a Pokémon GO tie-in to be had? Only time will tell.

I've tested the keyboard for PC gaming, and I've found it quite lovely - so I thought I'd let you know that this model is down to £99.99 at Currys, which is £50 less than its usual price and a good deal for high-grade wireless mechanical.

As spotted by outlets like The Verge, Sony submitted a document with redactions. This is a common practice; companies will redact important financial data on these findings. However, it looks like the redaction didn't hold so well. After scanning the document, numbers appeared visible.

Though that's a great trifecta of games, we must ask whether Sony knows anything more than we do about upcoming real-world events, because that's quite a bleak list.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["Without hesitation"
The current future of Super Smash Bros. is unclear. Super Smash Bros. Ultimate kind of did everything it needed to do, is fully exhaustive from a content perspective, and Nintendo confirmed that the final DLC roster additions are complete. Series head honcho Masahiro Sakurai is also taking a much-needed rest. But that doesn't prevent other folks from dreaming of what might have been, or what could be! That includes Mortal Kombat boss Ed Boon.
Speaking to Axios, here's what Boon had to say when asked about his ideal Mortal Kombat roster addition for Smash:
"Scorpion. Not even a hesitation. I guess if they want two, it would be Scorpion and Sub-Zero.”

Boon clarifies that they chose these two because they’re easy to see on the battlefield, and for the former, “it’s cool to see a spear pull somebody,” which current combatant Ridley would know a lot about.
I mean, it's hard to really argue with him! They have more cartoony designs than a few other "core" Mortal Kombat fighters that would mesh with the Smash aesthetic, and they constantly top "most recognizable characters" polls for the series. Of course, the entire prospect of adding Mortal Kombat characters to Smash is absurd, but then again, there is a precedent (like Metal Gear Solid's Snake, or Bayonetta's Bayonetta)!
This isn't the first time someone has weighed in on dream Super Smash Bros. roster additions
As you may recall, Blizzard employees wanted Diablo to make an appearance in the Smash series years back, and multiple creatives have been slowly providing their "dream picks" either directly or indirectly with Nintendo.
Clearly, some of that hard work paid off, as Sora was introduced through a chance meeting with a Disney representative.

Stray Fawn has announced that they’ve scooped up the publishing duties for The Wandering Band’s upcoming city-builder Airborne Empire. The current plan is to launch it into Early Access in 2024.
Airborne Empire is the sequel to 2020’s Airborne Kingdom, a game that I can’t believe I haven’t played. It’s a game about building floating cities! However, it also ties in exploration, as a flying city is the ultimate mobile home. Airborne Empire will introduce pilots into the mix, making it so you’ll have to defend your city, as well as the cities on the surface. Airborne Kingdom was pretty well-received, so I’m interested to see how the sequel gets off the ground.
https://youtu.be/l1ja7SaqFFM
Stray Fawn is the developer behind The Wandering Village, another unique take on the city builder genre. I had a chance to talk to co-founder Philomena Schwab about the whole genre, and it’s cool to see them get into the paradoxically named indie-publishing business. Getting noticed as a small or solo developer often seems like a communal effort, so I love watching them come together to form a supergroup. Airborne Empire will actually be Stray Fawn’s second publishing deal announced, after the upcoming Earth of Oryn.
Currently, Airborne Empire has only been announced for PC and Mac, and will be entering Early Access sometime in 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Resident Evil 3: Nemesis: Nemesis
If you remember the original Resident Evil 3, you'll recall the stress of encountering the brutish tyrant known as Nemesis. Well, the tables have turned, as a new fan-made mod for the classic game lets you play from the perspective of the rocket launcher-wielding beast.
Titled "Nemesis Scenario," curious fans may download this mod from ModDB (thanks DSO Gaming). You can also check the video below to see what it's like to fill the (heavy) boots of Nemesis and go stalking the streets of Raccoon City looking for members of S.T.A.R.S.
https://youtu.be/Jov5_ziYcOM
Flipping the script
Created by retro Resident Evil modder Komizo, "Nemesis Scenario" comes with two game modes. The first is the original, which lets you play Resident Evil 3 from the titular antagonist's point of view. The second is "Arrange Mode," in which you hunt down S.T.A.R.S. and mercenaries, but without the story from the main game.
The video demonstrating the mod certainly takes away the tension typically found in Resident Evil 3. You''ll see Nemesis easily take out regular zombies, with cut scenes from the 1999 Resident Evil entry interspersed throughout. It kind of fits canonically, showing what Nemesis was possibly up to while Jill and Carlos frantically worked on puzzles.
While both the original version and the remake of Resident Evil 4 left a big impact, many have not forgotten the classic entries in the series. Resident Evil 3 and its remake were not necessarily celebrated installments. But the 1999 release still counts itself among the first iconic Resident Evil games that established the franchise.
Speaking of remakes, Capcom recently asked which Resident Evil game fans wanted to see get remade next. Some fans may believe Resident Evil 5's turn is due, but Capcom has made no announcements at this time. For now, if you have the original Resident Evil 3 on PC, you can check out Komizo's Nemesis mod.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's-a fatality.
When Nintendo revealed that "everyone is here!" for Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, it wasn't lying. Well, ok, not everyone is in the game, but Sakurai and co. did a pretty good job of bringing in familiar faces from all walks of gaming life. We've even got characters from other series in the genre like Street Fighter, Fatal Fury and Tekken. However, one name is notably missing from this lineup: Mortal Kombat.
Of course, this makes a lot of sense. The blood and guts of NetherRealm Studios' take on the genre was never really going to gel with Nintendo's slightly less stabby brawl — and come on, nobody wants to see Kirby's insides — and, according to series co-creator Ed Boon, Nintendo has never asked for permission to move any of the characters over (thanks, Axios).

One of the things I respect about the medium of video games is its ability to tackle difficult situations in a way that other mediums can’t. Even when it comes to non-visual mediums like, say, the written word, we’re only spectators. A video game can make things about us. Some empathy is still required, but we can be the ones trapped in an uncomfortable situation.
Sometimes this is too much. When I played He Fucked the Girl Out of Me last year, it actually dug up memories of (unrelated to the subject matter) trauma that I had repressed. It was for the best, but it was also a lot.
But it doesn’t always have to be a lot, as A Long Journey to an Uncertain End proves. You can approach difficult subjects carefully and with a light hea…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Is it secure enough?
Last night, I clicked on a link I saw floating around social media for something called The Password Game. It seemed a little neat; make a secure password against an ever-increasing set of rules. What I thought would be a momentary distraction ended up with me, and my Discord call, furiously searching Google and calculating math to try and outsmart an expanding, seemingly malicious ruleset. Our password, ultimately, failed.
The Password Game is a new overnight web game sensation from developer Neal Agarwal. They've made a number of fun, unique games with quirky problems to solve, like Absurd Trolley Problems. With The Password Game, it starts simple: make a password.
Of course, good web games are never so simple. Gradually, Agarwal introduces rules. Rules that, as they describe it, "ensure [they] will never see the pearly gates."
https://twitter.com/nealagarwal/status/1673703594778927105
Rules, rules, rules
I don't really want to spoil any of the big rule surprises for you, as that's a big part of the fun: discovering what The Password Game will throw at you. It was actually a joy to do this in a Discord call, and I highly, highly recommend doing the same if you can. Making The Password Game a social situation is great, not just because you can all collaborate, but you can share in the confusion. (My one hint? Maybe grab a Periodic Table of Elements.)
Either way, go in sight unseen and just see how far you go. Maybe even share your first-time experiences here? I'm fascinated to see how far people get. Apparently, some folks are even beating it. I don't know if I can fully figure that out, but part of me—a deep-seated, unwell aspect of myself—does want to try. At the very least, I can end up with a very, very secure password.
Try your hand at The Password Game here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[No love for Nvidia, it seems
If you were hoping to get the most out of your Nvidia RTX 4000 graphics card when Starfield launches, you might be out of luck. It turns out developer Bethesda will optimize the anticipated sci-fi RPG for AMD's hardware instead.
This comes from a recent YouTube video from AMD itself, which says that the Starfield studio has partnered with the tech giant to make the game run better on systems that use its processors and graphics chips. This is great news for those of you who have a PC containing Team Red's products. Less so if you've been putting your stock into Nvidia's offerings.
https://youtu.be/9ABnU6Zo0uA
Todd Howard himself said that the team is excited to be partnering with AMD, getting the game to run as best as it can on that particular hardware. He adds that Starfield will use FSR 2.0 (AMD's upscaling technology that offers an alternative to Team Green's DLSS). Nvidia fans may feel they're being shafted a little on this front, especially for those who were hoping to get their money's worth from a 4000 series.
However, for console users, this may be beneficial. The Xbox Series X/S runs on AMD technology, both in terms of CPU and GPU. Given that Starfield is an Xbox exclusive, many of you will likely choose this system for the game anyway. For PC users with an Nvidia card, obviously you'll still be able to run the game (depending on your spec). But it does sound like Bethesda has already sided with Lisa Su and her team.
That said, FSR 2.0 is more open-source than DLSS. This means you can still make use of the image processing algorithm even if you have an Nvidia graphics card.
Starfield will launch on PC and Xbox Series X|S on September 6.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Disney Illusion Island is an upcoming “Mickeyvania” exclusive to Switch and after being revealed over a year ago, it’s finally out next month. Dlala Studios and Disney have released a new story trailer to prepare potential players for what’s in store on the island. 
Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Donald Duck, and Goofy mysteriously arrive on the island of Monoth and soon after find that its people need their help. This kickstarts their journey as players must platform through the various obstacles, challenges, and biomes of Monoth. Each character has the same abilities (although animated quite differently), so players can select whichever hero they want to save the day. 
Check out the latest Disney Illusion Island story trailer for yourself below:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alongside a few other notable indies
Apple Arcade continues to truck on, as Apple can likely prop it up through thick and thin, no matter how lean the offerings might be at any given time. The powerhouse publisher has a lot to celebrate come July though, as Apple has confirmed that Stardew Valley will be hitting the service on July 21.
It's the main event (as far as I'm concerned), and I can't stop booting it up year-after-year, whether it's for a quick solo adventure or a multiplayer family outing.
Other games coming to Apple Arcade in July 2023, including one surprise
Beyond Stardew Valley, the Apple Arcade service is getting a few more additions:
Hello Kitty Island Adventure
Slay the Spire
LEGO Duplo World
Ridiculous Fishing EX
So the last one might stick out a bit, given that Vlambeer, the studio behind the viral arcade fishing hit, closed in 2020.
Speaking to Polygon, co-founder Rami Ismail shed some light on the situation, noting:
“Vlambeer remains closed, The both of us did collaborate on this, so we decided to keep it under the brand of Vlambeer, but we don’t expect more collaborations like this. The two of us, Zach Gage, and Greg Wohlwend just couldn’t resist the opportunity of revisiting the game that catapulted our careers — and having an opportunity to approach the game anew without the catch of the clones, and with 10 years of development experience. The team immediately realized that to do a proper take on the game for the modern day, we also wanted to bring aboard the creative powerhouses at KO_OP for their signature style of playfulness, to bring the game to life.”

It's great to see that the original creators were involved in this, rather than the classic tale of a rights-holding publisher forcing the IP to rise from the dead.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Johnny Silverhand gives his hot take
There isn't long to wait now until Cyberpunk 2077's Phantom Liberty DLC releases. Following on from the main story, the new content will be a moodier dive into the underbelly of Night City's already seedy vibes. That's according to Keanu Reeves, anyway.
In a recent video posted to the official Cyberpunk 2077 YouTube channel, the actor, who reprises his role as Johnny Silverhand for the upcoming expansion, has been shooting the breeze about the DLC. When asked how he would describe Phantom Liberty, Reeves said that Dogtown, where the new story takes place, goes down to a "darker place" when compared to the vanilla game.
https://youtu.be/LXXqI6eYD6w
Perhaps channeling his inner Johnny, Reeves asserts (after politely asking if he could swear during the interview) that "s**t's gone down" in this new location. He adds that, in spite of the even more dystopian atmosphere that's incoming, he hopes it'll be a fun experience for people to play as well.
The Matrix star also talks a little bit about Solomon Reed, a new character in Phantom Liberty played by Idris Elba. His presence represents that extra bit of Hollywood stardom that CDPR wants for the expansion. Reeves says that Johnny has some things in common with Solomon, such as the "sense of being used" and the idea of trying to reclaim one's own life.
https://youtu.be/yifBJOwKFw0
Cyberpunk 2077 may have been one of the most controversial launches in game history, but the studio eventually turned things around with patches a-plenty. The upcoming DLC, which drops September 26, will give more than a few fans another reason to dive into this world. It sounds like it's going to be an interesting, if gritty, experience. Keanu Reeves summarizes Phantom Liberty by saying that it's a mixture of mystery, truth, a scavenger hunt for information, and whether or not you can count on anything.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Final Fantasy XVI hit PlayStation 5 exclusively last week on June 23, and less than a week later, Square Enix has announced it has shipped and digitally sold 3 million copies. 
It’s a somewhat odd metric to parse out because copies shipped and sold aren’t the same. For example, a shipped copy might still be sitting on a game store shelf, while a digital copy sold is money made. Nonetheless, between physical shipped copies of FFXVI and digital versions purchased by players, Square Enix says it has reached 3 million copies sold. 
We’re delighted to announce we’ve shipped and digitally sold 3 million copies of Final Fantasy XVI on PlayStation 5. Thank you for your support! #FF16 pic.twitter.com/8YGfo1RXyV

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Indiescovery is recorded a week before we release it, and never has this small time delay been more apparant than in our latest episode. Last week the temperature in the UK was (pardon my french) bonkers boiling. As we are professionals we recorded this episode with all of our windows closed and our fans turned off in order to avoid any unwanted background noise. Choosing to do this while sat in a British house during a heatwave actually violates several human rights laws, and we've all since been arrested for crimes against ourselves.
Oh, we also talk about our favourite indies from this year's Not-E3, which probably highlights the slight time delay more than the heat thing because in video game industry terms Not-E3 may as well have taken place 30 years ago. But listen, indie games are always relevant, aren't they? Plus I got to do a bit where I pretended to be a games executive in the intro so as far as I'm concerned it all worked out well in the end.

Let's instead watch these videos now, since they've just been uploaded as separate videos, to learn more about Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty's new district, Dogtown.

Remakes and remasters are more common than ever in 2023. What's most interesting is seeing how these new versions handle the issue of completely rebuilding versus simply making modern visual improvements. Story of Seasons: A Wonderful Life is a remake of Harvest Moon: A Wonderful Life that straddles the line between these two philosophies fairly evenly but still delivers an outdated experience in various aspects.

BattleBit Remastered is not something I would've normally leapt into, at first blush. The low-poly, almost Roblox-like character models made me think that its sudden popularity on the Steam charts might be a flash in the pan. But overlooking BattleBit on aesthetics alone would've meant missing out on rediscovering a piece of the FPS landscape I'd thought lost.
I loved old Battlefield. The World War II iterations were my first introduction, but there are few shooters I've put as much time into as my family did on Battelfield 2. It was the perfect mix of progression, variety, strategy, and shooting. I mention this to underscore the praise I'm giving BattleBit Remastered when I say it reminds me of Battlefield 2.

Originally released in 2015, it helped establish the lo-fi horror genre among the indie market. Maybe.

Shared on social media, the Evolution Championship Series says Street Fighter 6 has officially broken both a franchise and all-time Evo record for competitors.
https://twitter.com/EVO/status/1673466628636561408
Evo doesn't share how many players that is. But if we're judging by the previous record count of Street Fighter V at Evo 2016, that's over 5,000 registrants.
Sign-ups for Evo 2023 are still live for a little less than two weeks. Evo 2023 is set to run August 4 through 6 in Las Vegas, NV.
Back in the saddle again
I have to admit, it's nice to see Street Fighter thriving like this. Sure, Street Fighter V delivered some pretty great sets over the years. But it always felt like SFV couldn't get out from under its launch state.
Meanwhile, Street Fighter 6 has been an absolute grand slam. As Moyse put it so well, Street Fighter 6 is "a title that radiates excellence." And the players have been showing up, too. Alongside the big Evo numbers, this last week's CEO—where MenaRD took the top spot with both Luke and Blanka—also tallied up a ton of entrants.
Safe to say that Street Fighter 6 has made its impact on the scene. I'm curious to see what these numbers look like moving forward, after the launch year luster wars off. But this year's Evo debut for SF6 promises to be a big one.

I've been playing Quantum Break since it arrived on PC Game Pass, and I'm finding their oft-forgotten time-bending shooter is yet another modern Remedy game full of boring gunfights even as it gives you supernatural powers that could replace guns. Their apparent disinterest in gunfights is especially felt in a game so into telling a story that it ends chapters with TV-length live-action episodes starring actual Lance Reddick. Looking back over their past games, agh, as much as I want spooky investigations, I can't get excited about their next, Alan Wake 2.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ever since the makers of Desperados 3 and Shadow Tactics announced their brand new squad tactics game, I've been dying to get my hands on Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew. While Mimimi's previous games took place in mostly grounded historical settings, Shadow Gambit is about magical undead pirates hunting for mysterious booty and fighting a persecutive Inquisition. This shift into the supernatural is quite the change for Mimimi, which creative director Dominik Abé tells me was partly to challenge themselves as designers, but also so players could have a bit more fun with how they approached its plentiful stealth encounters.
"One thing we wanted for sure was that we had something that's not grounded in a realistic setting," Abé tells me. "That was a requirement for all the pitches we did internally, and that's because we wanted to improve on the gameplay. We were restricted by realism, so that was a core pillar. It had to be something fantasy, or sci-fi or something non-realistic."

While worldbuilding can be as simple as creating fictional characters and cities, some creators dive in deeply, crafting pantheons of gods, hundreds of years of wars and conflict, and even entire languages. While it makes the world more believable, it can be incredibly disorienting for an audience to be thrust headfirst into a sea of unfamiliar proper nouns, especially before they have a chance to get to know the world's characters. Lucky for me, the developers behind Final Fantasy XVI completely anticipated this and introduced a solution: the Active Time Lore mechanic.

We’ve now learned, thanks to video game analyst group Circana, that it was, unsurprisingly, the best selling game of the month. However, it’s also already the second best selling game of 2023, behind Hogwarts Legacy. 
What’s even more impressive is that Circana’s Tears of the Kingdom numbers do not include digital sales for the game – only physical, according to Circana executive director Mat Piscatella. That it’s the second best selling game of 2023 on just its physical numbers alone means this game sold exceptionally well. And there’s a good chance it might be the year’s best selling game if digital numbers are one day added.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Publisher Dear Villagers and developer Fallen Leaf Studios have released a new trailer on IGN for Fort Solis, the upcoming sci-fi horror game starring Roger Clark and Troy Baker. 
This trailer starts with Baker discussing how he came to be involved with Fort Solis and why he’s excited about the game before he reveals it hits PlayStation 5 and PC on August 22. The trailer then cuts to new footage of the game, which you can check out for yourself below: 


As you can see, Baker says he joined Fort Solis because it allowed him to work alongside Clark (whom you might recognize as Arthur Morgan from Red Dead Redemption 2) and because he liked the story as well. As for the new Fort Solis footage, it shows more of the spooky Martian horror featured in the game. In it, Clark’s character, Jack Leary, tries to survive “through one long and terrifying night on Mars.” Leary appears to be guided, in some way, by Baker’s Wyatt Taylor and Julia Brown’s character, Jessica Appleton. 
Fort Solis hits PlayStation 5 and PC on August 22.

Unsurprisingly, these monitors also cost a huge amount of money, with even lower-end options in the £600+ range and higher-end examples in the quadruple figures. 
Two or three years on, things have settled down and these HDMI 2.1 monitors are now much more affordable - if not yet exactly cheap. One such example is the Acer Nitro XV282KKV, a 28-inch monitor with a 4K 144Hz refresh rate on PC, that's down to £409.98 plus £5 shipping at Ebuyer. That's nearly £200 off its UK RRP and an awesome deal for a monitor with these specs.

        <updated>2023-06-26T16:01:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Publisher Humble Games and developer Crema have revealed Temtem Showdown, a new standalone battle-focused game, and it's out right now. 
This surprise reveal comes less than a year after the full 1.0 release of Temtem, the game that Showdown is based on. Similar to Pokemon Showdown, Temtem Showdown is all about battling. It's also free to everyone. 
"Temtem Showdown takes the best Temtem competitive action and places it within immediate reach for everyone," a press release reads. "Get to know the colorful critters from the massively multiplayer creature-collection adventure, build your team in seconds, and dash into battle to test it out against other players and their teams – or carefully curate a plan of action to overpower your opponents." 
Unlike Temtem, which is a multiplayer Pokemon-like game where you catch and train Temtem to use in 2 vs. 2 battles, Showdown will let players build a team from scratch right from the jump. And then you can hop right into a battle, without needing to worry about their level like you might in the base game. You can play against other players both casually and competitively, and the latter will feature a ranked system and a ladder to climb up as you play. 
Crema says Showdown will receive regular balance patches to keep the meta fair, and new Seasons will bring additional content and changes as well. 
For more, read our thoughts on the base game in Game Informer's Temtem review.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Six months ago, MMORPG Temtem introduced a mode that let you jump straight into the game’s 2v2 turn-based battles, ignoring the busywork of quests, creature-catching, and all the other Pokémon-isms. Showdown was the mode's name; something for the animal fight pit lovers in the room, rather than the plain old animal lovers. That mode has now been spun into a free standalone release aptly called Temtem Showdown, out now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Between the Super Mario Bros. Movie and several announcements during last week's Nintendo Direct, Nintendo's mascot is having a great 2023. Carrying on the Mario momentum, Oreo announced a limited-edition cookie collab with the iconic Nintendo franchise.
The cookies feature 16 unique embossments starring characters like Mario, Luigi, Yoshi, Goomba, and Bowser Jr., as well as power-ups like Super Stars and Fire Flowers. Packs will be filled at random. Oreo is also holding a social media event where they're asking those who buy the cookies to stack as many of the hero-embossed cookies on the rim of a glass of milk without the cookies falling into the milk and share the video on social media in a concerted effort to save Princess Peach from Bowser's Castle.
"We hope to unite cookie lovers and Super Mario enthusiasts alike with this playful mission, inspired by a storyline fans know all too well," Oreo senior brand manager Vishnu Nair said in a press release. "We may even reveal a surprise as a thank you to those who successfully defeat Bowser and save the kingdom... Fans will have to wait and see!"
You can check out a fun musical trailer for the collaboration below.


The Oreo x Super Mario cookies will begin rolling out to retailers nationwide starting July 10, but will only be available for a limited time.

The confusion began yesterday, June 25, when Bethesda's support Twitter account tweeted that all physical versions of the upcoming game would include a code instead of a disc, a message that was later deleted without clarification. You can read all about that in the original version of this post below, but that same support account responded this afternoon with a link to a June 11 blog post detailing the release details and stating...
"Starfield Standard Edition is included with Xbox Game Pass. Game disc included with physical purchases of Xbox Standard Edition. Game code included with physical purchases on PC Standard edition."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last week while I was away from my desk, Pete Hines showed that the Starfield hype train is an unstoppable perpetual motion engine, and he certainly won't pull the emergency break for something as normie as a federal court. While his comments were part of the ongoing Actiblizz acquisition malarkey (the point seemingly being "it's so big it'd be too hard to optimise for PS5"), hearing him pitch Bethesda's upcoming grey-rocks-but-in-space-this-time RPG as "irresponsibly large" made me want to go full Reggie Perrin.
Every time I bring my reviews of giant games to the altar of the industry, I weep tears of blood and beg that games be shorter. And every time the golden idol with the face of Phil Spencer opens its maw to spit a new £80 disc out and says: "Bigger than ever before. A million pointless collectibles. A feast of zero-calorie content. Lol. Lmao."

Amidst all the madness though, one indie has been able to blast through the noise to become a smash hit on Steam - only sitting behind CS:GO on the sales charts - and potentially one of this year’s biggest shooters. That impressive feat goes to BattleBit Remastered, a 254-player FPS that mixes Battlefield’s large-scale skirmishes, Roblox’s low-poly aesthetics, and some wild destructible environments.

The cyber attacks prevented many players from logging into Diablo IV, and the hack-and-slashers that managed to log in were at risk of “high latency and disconnections” in the always-online RPG. That tragically forced many gamers to step outside during the hottest weekend in recent memory. Thankfully, Blizzard now states the DDoS attacks have ended, meaning everything should be working as normal.

I highlighted it in our big demo rec list at the start of the week, but 150-odd words simply wasn't enough to really get across just how excellent this is.

This news comes from yesterday's court trial between Xbox (and Activision Blizzard) and the Federal Trade Commission over Microsoft's attempted acquisition of Activision Blizzard. Bond claimed in court that, in the leadup to the launch of the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S generation of hardware in 2020, Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick said his company did not intend to put Call of Duty – presumably new, upcoming ones – on the Xbox platform unless Microsoft shared more revenue.

The update was announced in November 2022 as part of the game's 2023 roadmap.
The Sonic's Birthday Bash update adds new challenges, moves, and a new kind of collectible Koco for Sonic. The update also promises free birthday decorations for our hero, as well as the addition of New Game Plus. As is standard with most New Game Plus modes, you can begin the adventure from the start with all of your skill tree and power-up levels carried over into the new file.
Sonic's Birthday Bash arrives free to download beginning today at 5 p.m. PT / 8 p.m. ET. The first of three content updates arrived in March, adding a photo mode, Cyber Space Challenges, and Battle Rush mode, plus a jukebox featuring collectible songs from Sonic's past. The third update, which promises to be the most substantial, adds new playable characters and a new story and is set to arrive later this year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You know when the look of a game instantly captures your attention, and then you play a demo for it and it's even better? That's the journey I've been on with deckbuilding RPG Cross Blitz this week. I first heard about it last month back when word hit that it was coming to early access this year, and I was instantly taken with its chunky animal character sprites. There was something a bit Advance Wars about the look and style about its burly lion pirate captain, but just, you know, in a high seas card battle kind of setting instead of dealing with sergeants, tanks and air support. But its Steam Next Fest demo has really sunk its teeth into me this week, offering up turn-based card duels that scratch exactly the same kind of itch as Inscryption did for me a couple of years ago.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sonic Superstars received prime placement in both the Summer Game Fest 2023 stream and this week's Nintendo Direct. As you might imagine, today's Sonic Central also shined a spotlight on the highly anticipated 2D Sonic game. We received a new trailer that showed off some new DLC coming to Sonic Superstars that features a collaboration with the Lego brand.
Players will be able to download a free Lego Sonic DLC skin to give the Blue Blur a new, bricky look. In addition, those who preorder Sonic Superstars will receive a Lego Eggman skin as well. You can see the new trailer below.


While Sonic is a recent addition to the Lego stable of characters, he appeared in the 2015 toys-to-life game Lego Dimensions, where he received specialized stages geared towards the speedy playstyle. However, it wasn't until 2021 that Lego officially greenlit a fan creation featuring Green Hill Zone from Sonic Mania. Then, earlier this year, Lego announced four new Sonic the Hedgehog Lego sets, which will be available in August.
Sonic Superstars arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC later this year. For more, check out our hands-on preview right here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am having an absolute riot playing Killer Frequency. It’s a first-person puzzle horror where you're trying to help folks escape a rampaging murderer. Usually, when I read a game description like that, I’m already grabbing my cushion to hide behind and readying my cute puppy compilation video on a second screen, but Team17 have heavily leaned into the campy side of slasher horror with humour serving as the perfect buffer. No safety cushion or puppies needed here, folks. 
Here’s the set-up: You’re playing as Forrest Nash, a big-time radio DJ who has found himself stuck in Small Town, Nowhere, USA. While you're working as the host for the town’s local station, it turns out the police chief has only gone and gotten themselves stabbed by a serial killer. With them out of action, you’re roped into acting as a stand-in 911 operator - and with the murderer still on the loose and ready to strike again, that line is going to be pretty busy.

The injunction would further prevent Microsoft's acquisition deal of Activision Blizzard from going through. 

Several of Xbox's high profile figures testified at the first day of trial, including the likes of Sarah Bond, corporate vice president of gaming partnerships and business development at Microsoft, Bethesda head of publishing Pete Hines, and Xbox Game Studios head Matt Booty. They were questioned on a range of things including cloud gaming, Call Of Duty exclusivity, and Bobby Kotick's revenue share demands.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are a bunch of reasons I like The Tartarus Key (enough to make it our RPS Game Club pick this month), and one of them is that it's not actually scary. Like, sure, you could attach the horror tag to it on Steam if you wanted, but it's more of a costume for you to enjoy - like the family down the street who are really into Halloween and turn their suburban semi into a haunted house with a movie-quality zombie in the front yard. It's really cool and you like it on its own terms, but being frightened isn't so much the point as it is to remember you have enjoyed being frightened in the past. Also, for some reason the family won't let you out of the living room until you complete a logic puzzle involving maths.

It's been emotional whiplash for some PC fans.

Just don't expect it within six months. Or before 2024, actually.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We’ve all been there. You’re playing a game you really like; the action is tight, the visuals are impressive, and the systems are engaging. Then a character opens their mouth, and the dialogue and how it’s delivered is so cringeworthy that you’re ready to jump ship. Sometimes that’s bad writing. But when we’re talking about a game from a different part of the world, it’s just as likely that questionable localization is the culprit. 
Localization and translation are difficult. Doing it exceptionally well is exceedingly difficult. Often, minute cultural differences in how storytelling is delivered in different places can add up; in the aggregate, those minor differences can alienate players from another region. Another contributing complexity is the way that language, facial expressions, and…]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-06-22T19:17:40.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bethesda's Indiana Jones game, which is currently being developed by Wolfenstein developer Machine Games, will be exclusive to Xbox. 
This news comes from an ongoing court trial between the Federal Trade Commission and Xbox (and Activision Blizzard, which Microsoft is trying to acquire) happening today, which is where Bethesda's Head of Publishing Pete Hines revealed the game will be a console exclusive on Xbox, as reported by IGN. Like Xbox's other first-party releases, Machine Games' Indiana Jones game will also come to PC. 
However, Hines also revealed that Disney and Bethesda parent company ZeniMax originally signed an agreement that this Indiana Jones game would be multiplatform, meaning it'd likely also release on PlayStation. Hines says after Microsoft acquired ZeniMax in 2020, the agreement with Disney was amended to transition the Indiana Jones game away from a multiplatform release and instead, into one that will release exclusively on Xbox and PC.


Today's court trial also revealed that Xbox head Phil Spencer told Hines that Bethesda should look at title exclusivity on a case-by-case basis, IGN reports. As for why Indiana Jones was transitioned into an exclusive, Hines cited "reducing risk and trying to get a degree of clarity." 
"You're dealing with a licensor who is giving a ton of feedback on what you're making, is going to add a ton of time to your scheduling, these agreements, you don't get to take as long as you want, you have a window of time in which you're going to release a game, you immediately have a clock that's ticking on you," Hines said, according to IGN.
Bethesda revealed Machine Games' Indiana Jones game back in 2021 with a short teaser trailer, and that was the last we've seen of it. However, Bethesda head Todd Howard says he first pitched this Indiana Jones game way back in 2009. There's still no release window for the game today.

I really enjoyed my time with it, giving it an 8.5 out of 10 in the official Game Informer review (which you can read here). From its explosive story to its fast-paced and robust combat, it’s a treat for any Final Fantasy fan, especially those looking for an extra dose of action. However, it’s still a Final Fantasy, meaning there are dozens of hours of content to experience, from the main story to the side quests, hunts, and more. 
With FFXVI now behind me after more than 65 hours (although I’m still tinkering with the idea of getting the Platinum trophy for it on PlayStation 5), I’m excited to share with you 10 tips and tricks I think you should know before getting started in FFXVI. And look, if you began FFXVI at midnight right when it…]]></summary>

While Sonic Mania was a 2D platformer, the studio's first game under their new name brings them into the realm of 3D, taking an incredibly vibrant colour palette that would certainly work in any classic Sonic game, and marrying it a world that one could say is mildly reminiscent of the hedgehog's rival Mario.

It apparently helps to crib the mining, mineral hoarding, and maladroit approach to industrial safety that makes source material Deep Rock Galactic one of the best FPS games going.
Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor is in the works at Funday Games, not original DRG devs and fellow Danish outfit Ghost Ship Games. But it does fall under the latter’s new publishing arm, Ghost Ship Publishing, and can trace its origins back to a casual meeting between Funday co-founder Anders Leicht Rohde and Ghost Ship CEO Søren Lundgaard – and beyond.

At best, studios reimagine classic experiences in exciting new ways, sand away rough edges, and somehow retain the intangible x-factors that made fans fall in love with these titles in the first place. At the very least, remakes offer a great way to play antiquated or less accessible experiences on modern hardware. 
The remake boom has been in full swing in recent years to the point that it’s starting to get tough to keep track of all the projects in the works.

From now on, EA Games will be known as EA Entertainment, which really doesn't have as good a ring to it (no one's going to be quoting "it's in the entertainment," any time soon are they?). The name change does imply a broader expansion into more than just games, but it's obviously a bit of a wait and see kind of situation until EA show off something that isn't a video game.

It's an adaptation on one of Toriyama's lesser-known mangas, which features a band of misfits who aim to right the wrongs of a king who's hogged the desert's vital water supply. I got to play it for all of 20 minutes, in a demo that was as stripped back as a grated cactus. Still, I got to sample a bit of roaming about in a tank, one brief stop at a town, an opening of one (1) chest, and some fighting. It seemed okay, I guess? But my main worry is whether its desert is interesting enough to hold people's attention.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Final Fantasy XVI is finally out! I really enjoyed it, giving it an 8.5 out of 10 in the official Game Informer review (which you can read here). And one of the main reasons I enjoyed my 65+ hours with it was the combat. It’s fast-paced and bombastic and continues to grow more and more robust as you play through the game’s story. 
However, it can be difficult. As someone with dozens of hours in the game (and still playing more as I stretch into its endgame content) and a pretty good handle on FFXVI’s combat, I’m here to help with that! Here are 10 tips and tricks to help you dominate the battlefield in FFXVI.

The match was too close to call – 1990 to 1995 – but I wasn't keeping track. All that stood between my team and victory was a chubby crocodile with a vacuum. I danced and jumped around him as he used his big belly and Luigi's Mansion-like hoover to bounce me around like a loose piece of cat fluff. I just needed a few moments to deposit my Wumpa Fruit, and victory would be ours. I had my blinders on, and that was a mistake. The enemy team's Wumpa Fruit meter quickly filled to 2000, and the match was over. My…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft has done a great job making some truly inventive special edition Xbox Series controllers, and their latest effort is one that uses the 'NASA-punk' aesthetics of upcoming big budget Bethesda RPG Starfield. The controller looks phenomenal, but it does cost a fair bit - so I thought it was worth letting you know that the early adopter tax has been lifted, and the controller is now down to £65. 
That's still fairly expensive, but given that this controller seems destined to sell out - as it has done in the US - then I thought it was worth bringing up regardless.

There are flayed corpses everywhere, fathers are haunted by the ghosts of their dead sons, blokes cram flaming eyeballs into their skulls and sometimes a guy turns up at random just to stomp you (and a lot of other people) into fleshy jam on the ground. Given all the abject suffering that the game and its predecessors make their stock and trade, it was an especially nice surprise to see real, genuine positivity emerge out of the literal hellscape of Sanctuary.

Guttural sounds echoed from ebony nests; pounding steps grew louder the longer my marines stayed still.

That makes it a cheaper alternative to their PCIe 4.0 drives with DRAM, but still more than fast enough for PC gaming. Therefore, it's worth knowing that the 1TB 980 is now available for less than £40 at Amazon, a £16 reduction from its usual price and less than half the cost it debuted at back in 2021.

In childish, whimsical fashion as a childish, whimsical child, I grab my pair of chopsticks and start hitting them together as if I'm a drummer. "Olivia, don't do that," my mum scolds me. "Your grandma always used to tell me off when I did that as a child." Sullenly, I put the chopsticks back down on the table.

Well, 10 year old me, you're in for a treat. If you wait a couple of decades, you'll learn of Nour: Play With Your Food, a game which allows you to bang together chopsticks. The game wants you to. Nour is a physics simulation of a variety of foods, where you can choose the ingredients for the dish and add various "effects" of a non-culinary nature.

During today's Nintendo Direct, we got our first details on Wave 5 of the Booster Course Pass DLC, which is set to hit within the next couple of months.
Booster Course Pass Wave 5 will feature an all-new course in the bathroom-themed Squeaky Clean Sprint, as well as three new characters. Petey Piranha, who made his debut in Mario Kart: Double Dash; Wiggler, who debuted in Mario Kart 7; and Kamek, who appears in Mario Kart Tour (and was a character in Mario Kart 64 before being replaced by Donkey Kong in the retail version) are all set to join the roster of playable racers in this wave of DLC. Seven more courses will join the pack as well, but we have no indication of which tracks those will be just yet. You can see the announcement trailer below.


Wave 5 of the Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Booster Course Pass arrives this summer. The Booster Course Pass is included as a part of the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription plan, or you can buy the DLC pack itself for $25.]]></summary>

The game first launched for PlayStation in 1998 (1999 in the U.S.) and stars protagonists Claude, a human federation officer, and Rena, a mystically powered girl, who players choose to control in separate campaigns. The game heavily emphasizes decision-making as your choices determine which of many playable allies you meet along the way join your party. 


This enhanced remake includes a modernized version of the game’s real-time combat; players can now stun enemies with chain attacks. Another cool addition is that party members not in combat can still lend a hand by executing assist-style follow-up attacks.

But Link was far from the only star of Nintendo's most popular game of 2023. During today's Nintendo Direct, the company announced the two other stars, Zelda and Ganondorf, are also set to receive Amiibo figures.
While the Tears of the Kingdom Link Amiibo is somewhat disappointing in its functionality (mostly the same as its Breath of the Wild counterpart), it provides special fabric for Link's paraglider. It appears as though fans should expect similar functionality from the upcoming Zelda and Ganondorf Amiibo figures, as the press release promises "valuable in-game items, as well as special fabric for the paraglider." 
The Tears of the Kingdom Zelda and Ganondorf Amiibo figures arrive later this holiday season. For more on what each Amiibo in the Legend of Zelda series does within The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, check out our Amiibo guide here.

The 2D worlds sport trippy features caused by a new power-up called the Wonder Flower. This transforms the world and gameplay in unexpected ways; pipes come to life, Mario can stretch his body to absurd lengths, and hordes of stampeding rhinos can appear, among other wacky effects. The biggest gasp came from a new power-up that transformed Mario into an elephant. Yes, you read that right. Mario's an elephant now, and it looks delightfully ridiculous.

More specifically, the Arkham Trilogy is due out this fall and promises to allow players to experience "the definitive versions of Rocksteady's Arkham Trilogy games." This trilogy also includes all post-launch content, including DLC expansions, suits, Batmobiles, and more. All three of these games have been available elsewhere for years but this trilogy marks the first time Switch players can play through all three games. 
Check out Batman: Arkham Trilogy in the reveal trailer below: 


Unfortunately, this trilogy does not include the (pretty great) Batman: Arkham Origins, which wasn't developed by Rocksteady; it was developed by Gotham Knights developer WB Games Montreal. However, the three games in this trilogy are still great, so it's still a good get for the Switch platform.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In addition to a robust look at gameplay in Pikmin 4, today’s Nintendo Direct brought a small fun update on the older games in the series.
Whether you played the originals in 2001 and 2004 on GameCube, or you’ve always been curious to try out those early games in the franchise, Nintendo is providing a chance to explore the games once again. HD versions of both projects are headed into the Nintendo eShop today.
Both games were critically lauded in their day for the creative approach they took to puzzles and problem solving, as well as the charming presentation and setting.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo has announced WarioWare: Move It, a new game in the long-running microgame series. 
The company revealed this during today's Nintendo Direct, highlighting the unique ways players can use two Joy-Con (and body movement) to complete microgames. One example shows a player using Joy-Con to balance Mario sliding in Super Mario 64. There's also plenty of first-person Wario action as well, with one microgame showing Wario trying to break out of what appears to be a jail cell. 


As you'd expect, WarioWare: Move It features a very unique, albeit strange, art style. Plus, it features two-player local co-op and a special Party Mode that allows up to four players to play various microgames together. 
WarioWare: Move It hits Switch on November 3.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pikmin 4 is right around the corner, but that didn't stop Nintendo from flooding us with new information about the game during today's Nintendo Direct. From a new underground area, to night expeditions, to a new demo out next week, here's everything you need to know about Pikmin 4.


The main draw in the newest game in the Pikmin series is Oatchi, a dog-like companion that assists you and your Pikmin as you try to survive the cute and hostile alien world. In addition to helping out with lifting and pushing items, you and your Pikmin can ride him across land and water. You'll also be able to upgrade his abilities over time, increasing the amount of damage he does, the number of Pikmin he can carry, or the total weight of objects he can push.
You'll need those upgraded abilities to explore Pikmin 4's new underground areas, which appear to be more heavily centered around contraption-based puzzles. With more treasures and new enemies, it's a lot less open than the aboveground portions, but should provide an interesting challenge.
Finally, Pikmin 4 marks the first time in the series your explorer will be able to go on nighttime expeditions. Wild creatures are in a frenzy, making them much more dangerous, but you'll have the help of the new Glow Pikmin, a species only out at night. Instead of throwing them one by one, you can focus them into one glowing energy ball to release all at once, doing huge amounts of damage.
If you want to try it for yourself, a demo for Pikmin 4 will be available on the Nintendo eShop on June 28. The full game will be released one month from today, on July 21. For more on the game, check out the recent trailer that reveals you can customize your explorer, or download Pikmin 1 and 2 on your Switch right now.]]></summary>

Thankfully for me, there's been a fair few riffs on Dorformantik's formula recently - a focus on nature, a soothing soundtrack, and some good old puzzling. Growth is one of these, and I'm hooked on the demo that's playable as part of Steam Next Fest. Taking place on a hexagonal grid, the aim is to uncover the map using a range of wildlife, fertilising the land in the process. Each tile you reveal gives you points, and you'll have to navigate around mountains, water, and special landmarks.

From what Manuel Bronstein, Roblox's Chief Product Officer, shared in an official blog post yesterday, it seems that it'll be on creators to label their experiences as mature, which "may contain more violence, blood, or crude humour" than usual experiences.
The introduction of age appropriate access is not for safety primarily, as Roblox say they want to "simulate and even go beyond what's possible in the real world". Bronstein also added that, "We want to replicate that dynamic on Roblox," referring to the idea of getting older and legally being allowed to enter places such as nightclubs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As I write this many of the development team and other members of the community are busy having fun at a meet-up in Brussels. Not me though, I’m stuck here doing a release. We’ve been busy refactoring quite a lot of the underlying code to make future changes easier, but along the way we’ve found and fixed a few more bugs and quality of life improvements that we figured were worth releasing sooner than whenever 14.0 comes along. Notably, OpenTTD will now automatically disable hardware acceleration if it detects that the last crash happened while initialising the graphics driver. While hardware acceleration works well for the vast majority of people, it causes crashes for people that then required command line arguments or manual config file editing to get it to work. This should be a better solution for those users. Additionally, there is a change to the default mouse mode on Linux to improve experience when dragging the map (and often to match expected behaviour in other games). As always, there are plenty of other bugfixes, which you can find in the changelog. While you’re at it, have you seen the post about the upcoming addition of a automated opt-in survey to OpenTTD 14? If you have opinions, we’d like to hear them! Details here. Download Changelog Bug tracker]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A stalwart party exploring the unknown, seeking the fabled Inner Sanctum. But all is not what it seems in the world of Varn...
The ScummVM Team is pleased to announce full support for the PC version of the first game of the Might and Magic series: Might and Magic Book One: The Secret of the Inner Sanctum. Two modes are supported:
The original look and feel of the game (sound, which in the original consisted of merely the occasional beep, is not supported)
A ScummVM-exclusive enhanced mode, which uses the interface of the later Xeen games, including niceties such as better character screens, automapping, and sound effects. It also integrates the impressive "Might and Magic 1 Graphics Overhaul Mod", which provides better in-game map and monster graphics. The xeen.cc file is required from Might and Magic: IV or Might and Magic: World of Xeen.
Both modes allow saving your game anywhere outside of combat via the ScummVM Global Main Menu (unlike the original game that only saved a single roster when checking into an inn). So make sure you save regularly, just in case you encounter problems.
Help us test both game modes by grabbing a daily build and adding mm.dat to the same folder as your game files. Read through our testing guidelines, and please take some screenshots along the way.
Now, go forth, and discover the true secrets of the game that started the long running epic fantasy series!
