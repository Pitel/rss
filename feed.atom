It's that time of year again, folks. No, not Christmas, though for many it may well be just as exciting. It's time for The Game Awards 2023!
We're expecting a genuinely thrilling event in December following what may well have been one of the strongest years in gaming ever, with the likes of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, Super Mario Bros. Wonder, and Sea of Stars on Switch all demonstrating just how good we've got it at the moment.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yakuza: Like A Dragon was a very silly game in spite of its dramatic narrative, but its follow-up, Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth, looks to give it a run for its money. Between letting Ichiban ride a dolphin and its Animal Crossing-style city-building mode, fans of the franchise’s goofball nature should be in for a treat, and a new batch of screenshots highlight this.
The images provide looks at Ichiban, Kiryu Joryu, and their returning friends, such as Nanba, Adachi, and Saeko, kicking butt in a variety of classes and looking absurd doing so. Other familiar faces will be playable party members for the first time, such as Seonhee, who is shown brutalizing opponents with a whip in the images. It's clear that Hawaii will never be the same once these guys are done with it. 


Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on January 26. You can learn more about the game and see it in action in this pair of trailers. Be sure to also read our review of its direct predecessor, Like A Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name, here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It feels like Steam has some sort of sales event almost on a weekly basis. Recently, we had the Scream Fest to celebrate Halloween, and now we're getting another one as we head towards the tail end of November.


As always with these things, we can never be 100% sure of what games will be discounted. However, if you take a look at the video below, there are a few major titles that do crop up, suggesting they will part of Steam's next sale.




We're treated to clips from the likes of Hitman 3, Star Wars: Jedi Survivor, Sons of the Forest, The Last of Us: Part 1, and even Starfield. The Autumn event begins November 21 and goes through until November 28, and with such a line-up, it looks like it'll be an interesting one to keep an eye on.


It's been quite the year


As we edge ever closer to the closing weeks of 2023, many of us will start reflecting on the last twelve months that have been and gone. While this year has been great for video game releases, a lot of joy has been sullied by the ongoing (and rather brutal) layoffs that have occurred across the industry in general.


As such, it's been quite the rollercoaster, but things seem to be trundling along unabated, and the Steam Autumn sale event is just one example.


Of course, Christmas is coming up soon, so we'll be seeing the Winter sale go live over the holiday period. Nothing like a ruck of discounted games at a time when everyone's spending too much money anyway.

November 21st, 2023 marks the 25th anniversary of The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time's Japanese launch. To mark this historic Hyrulean occasion, we'll be running articles throughout the week dedicated to the game, our memories, and its legacy. Today, Ollie sings the praises of Ocarina of Time's mystical opening location, Kokiri Forest...

Before Ocarina of Time launched back in 1998, the Legend of Zelda franchise didn’t really provide players with a good opportunity to acclimatise to its world. Think about it: both NES games threw you into the middle of Hyrule with little introduction, A Link to the Past saw you almost immediately infiltrate Hyrule Castle’s dungeon, and while Link’s Awakening started off in the cosy confines of Tarin’s house, it's not long before you're on the beaches of Koholint Island, surrounded by Sand Crabs, Leevers, and Octoroks.

If you’re unfamiliar Against the Storm is a city-builder where you’re dropped in the middle of the forest and need to get a settlement up and running before the world’s monarch gets pissed off at you. Your job is to obtain enough reputation points to complete the expedition, at which point you’ll be rewarded for your success with meta-resources that you can spend to progress up the technology tree.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The co-op horror / scavenging game Lethal Company has exceeded 100,000 concurrent players via Steam. In fact, according to Steam Charts, the horror experience has reached a peak player total of 114,672 at the time of writing.




“While I was asleep Lethal Company passed 100,000 concurrent players,” the developer wrote in a post on Twitter. “Unbelievable, thank you for playing. Releasing updates for this game will be very fun.”


Lethal Company entered Early Access on Steam on October 23, so the fact that less than a month later it’s celebrating over 100,000 concurrent players is kind of amazing, especially for a game made by a solo developer who got their start on the Roblox platform.




Following the peak players announcement, Zeekerss wrote via Twitter that Lethal Company’s “next enemy is seasonal,” but the developer made certain to clarify they used the word “enemy” intentionally. “These ones will not be 'creatures' as I refer to the rest. These are Enemies. Antagonists. Combatants. Foes. Enjoy this pre-invasion time.”


In the replies, one user asked if their usage of the word “seasonal” implied the new enemy would only be present in the game temporarily. Zeekerss clarified that their use of the word “seasonal” was meant to suggest the enemy itself will be themed around the holiday season.




Lethal Company entered Early Access on October 23. In the co-op experience, players must salvage from “abandoned, industrialized moons” in order to fulfill their obligations to a mysterious “Company.” But, there’s a reason it’s co-op — while you’re hunting scrap, something else is hunting you. It is available via PC, and there are no indications at the moment of a console release.

In an effort to iron out the game’s technical problems and implement the mod editor, Paradox and developers Colossal Order have now delayed post-launch content included in the Expansion Pass.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While the regular, LCD-bound Steam Deck has been getting big improvements as of late as well, it's hard to deny that Valve's new Steam Deck OLED is the star of the show. The device's HDR OLED display is definitely its strongest feature, but there's more to it than just that.


More specifically, the graphics and tech analysis authority Digital Foundry has performed some in-depth testing of the Steam Deck OLED. "In receiving an impressive upgrade to its display, Steam Deck OLED attacks input lag seemingly on two fronts," says Digital Foundry's Richard Leadbetter. 


Leadbetter explains that not only is the OLED "typically" about 10 milliseconds faster than the old LCD display during regular use, but that its 90Hz refresh rate also plays into this, as a game that's been capped at just 30 FPS…]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-11-20T16:21:36.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a post on Twitter, Square Enix revealed that the previously mobile-only title Final Fantasy 7: Ever Crisis has been published to Steam and will be released on the platform later. The Gacha-style game revisits the story of Final Fantasy 7 and Final Fantasy 7: Crisis Core while also telling a new original story about Sephiroth in his younger days.




SOLDIER 1st Class


Our very own Timothy "The Wordsmith" Monbleau wrote about his feelings on Final Fantasy 7: Ever Crisis when it was released on mobile devices a couple of months ago. I've also had the chance to play quite a bit of it—well, completed all the original content in the title, at least—and can say everything he mentions is pretty on point. Even though the idea of more FF7 is always appealing...this isn't the way to do it. FF7:EC feels like a gacha game was developed and then a FF7 skin was thrown onto it.


However, I know even with the warning, some people just want more Final Fantasy. Even though you could previously access Final Fantasy 7: Ever Crisis through emulators like BlueStacks, this will be the first time it's easily and officially available on PC. New players who jump in on the Steam version will also get the pre-order rewards that were available on mobile. The rewards will help you get a jump start on progressing through the early missions, so it's a cool touch that they are giving the rewards to PC players as well.


There's no release date yet for when Final Fantasy 7: Ever Crisis will actually go live on Steam. According to the Twitter post, the release date will be announced soon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[November 19 was officially the 25th anniversary of Half-Life, one of the most influential FPS games ever made. Two and a half decades! It's hard to imagine, and it's even harder to imagine it's still going strong, as evidenced by recent statistics.


Spurred by this milestone birthday, Half-Life has received an influx of players, with SteamDB reporting the game's highest player count on record. Over the last 24 hours, 33,471 players have jumped back into the world of Black Mesa, the most it's ever achieved, according to the history.


Screenshot via Destructoid.


Going back as far as possible, the graph shows that, aside from a few spikes here and there, the game has retained a fairly steady flow of players. Until recently, of course. At the time of writing, nearly 19,000 people are playing right now. That's more than Starfield.


That's a lot of resonance cascades


It's no secret why Half-Life is experiencing a boon right now. To go with the 25th anniversary, Valve released a new update for the game, as well as a special documentary about the development of this absolute classic.


As such, it's on a lot of people's minds right now, and understandably so. Featuring one of the most iconic openings in an FPS, Half-Life raised the bar for what was possible in video game technology and storytelling.


If you've never played it before, now's your chance, as it's currently free on Steam. We might take a lot of its elements for granted these days but, take it from an aging gamer, this stuff was revolutionary at the time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After a stellar career at Housemarque, Harry Krueger is ready to move on to the next adventure in his life. 


In the announcement by Housemarque, Krueger is thanked for the work he has done, especially with Returnal, which played a large role in catapulting the studio from a small group of Finnish creators to a first-party Sony partner. Krueger also reflects on this and expresses pride in all the accomplishments his team has earned. 


Ilari Kuittinen, who is the General Manager and Co-Founder of Housemarque, also comments on Krueger's departure. He claims Krueger's "passion and direction have been vital" for the studio which has endured the death and rebirth of the "Arcade". 


Although Krueger doesn't explain what prompted the departure, he states that it was a difficult decision. He is also confident that the studio has a bright future ahead, as it has "an exciting new project in the works, a fantastic team that’s stronger than ever, and the continuous support of Sony and PlayStation Studios."


Krueger isn't the only notable industry figure who has stepped down from a long-held position. Pete Hines announced his departure from Bethesda not long after Starfield's launch, and Activision Blizzard's Bobby Kotick is also preparing to leave after 32 years with the gaming giant.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A Rare find.
It was almost 10 years ago that a group of former Rare developers got together and established Playtonic Games. This was a team consisting of many of the minds behind Banjo-Kazooie, Donkey Kong Country, and other such classics, so when their first title, Yooka-Laylee was released in 2017, we were relieved to see that level of creativity still very much alive and kicking (even more so with the improved Switch version later that year).
Playtonic would go on to release the side-scrolling platformer Yooka-Laylee and the Impossible Lair in 2019, a title that we felt took all of the best bits of its predecessor and improved on them — awarding it a 9/10 in our review, no less. While the studio has since been behind several games on the publishing side of things (Lil Gator Game, Demon Turf, and many more) a good few years have passed since it was last in the development seat. So, just what has been going on at Playtonic?

In the interim, modders have been making do, leading to the creation of an "immersive survival addon" for Starfield.


The aptly titled "Starvival" comes from a modder known as lKocMoHaBTl, and it successfully introduces a fairly important new gameplay mechanic into Starfield: the so-called Needs. Needs are, essentially, a comprehensive set of counters, buffs, addictions, and other complimentary features that turn Starfield into a game where food is, in fact, necessary. In the simplest terms possible, Starvival allows your Starfield character to get hungry and, if you're persistent enough, addicted to alcohol, which turns the g…]]></summary>

If we had to choose two words to describe In Stars and Time, we’d pick 'beautiful' and 'strange'. This story-driven RPG is ideal for fans of titles like Undertale and EarthBound. Don’t take that comparison to mean that it is identical to these games, though — it’s still its own experience.
Right off the bat, In Stars and Time looks great, with 4:3 aspect ratio that makes it feel more retro than it actually is. The music is gentle and soothing, and it pairs perfectly with the monochrome art style. The menu and settings are easy to navigate from the off, and the story starts with a detailed trigger warning; the game does have some text-based depictions of topics like suicide, which is worth being mindful of. Nothing is shown, but the dialogue is intense in places.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you're tired of waiting around for a third Portal game, there is a (sort of) solution out there. Until Valve takes it upon itself to carry on with the series, fans will take the reins in an unofficial capacity. And that's exactly what's happened here.


Portal: Revolution is not exactly a threequel to the Portal universe. Instead, it's actually a prequel that takes place before the events of the second game. Brought to us by Second Face Software, this mod comes complete with eight hours of gameplay, which includes more than 40 new test chambers. You can also check out the special "100,000 trailer views" Q&A video while you're at it.




The above trailer almost looks like an official new entry or something Valve would put together. As a community project, it definitely looks impressive, fitting in between the two installments with its own story and characters. It should be noted that you will need a legitimate copy of Portal 2 before you can use this free mod.


The modding community strikes again


You can always depend on the fan base to keep video game universes alive. Portal 2 recently got its own VR mode, thanks to the dedicated community, which is good seeing as Portal 3 is probably never going to happen. Prove me wrong though, Valve. Prove me wrong.


We've circled this proverbial airport many times before, especially when it comes to Half-Life. The continuation of Gordon Freeman's story is a dream many are struggling to hold onto these days.


Without any official sequels in the make that we're aware of, we can at least take solace in the unofficial stuff that's out there. Portal: Revolution is just one example of people showing they're not ready to accept Valve's unwillingness to bring us something new (Half-Life: Alyx notwithstanding, of course).

And according to game director Naoki Hamaguchi, it seems this vibe is, indeed, by design.


Last month, I had the opportunity to play Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth for myself. While I gave my honest thoughts about what I saw during that demo, the experience left me deeply curious about Rebirth's adherence to the original formula and what pieces would deviate. Fortunately, I didn't have to leave every curiosity unfulfilled, and I was provided the opportunity to email a few questions directly to the game's development team, which Hamaguchi himself kindly answered.

Yep, the same Logitech G502 Hero we post about every gosh-darn time there’s a Black Friday, or whatever mutant Prime Day variation Amazon has spawned.

Worldless opens with a battle of opposing stars; they cascade towards each other in what seems like an endless battle. From that epic scene-setter, we follow the journey of one such celestial body, who gains sentience and treks across an alien landscape to find…purpose?
The central mystery at the heart of this gorgeous platformer isn’t as important as the journey we take to solve it. This will serve to be a frustration in the long run, but the opening moments are all about the sensory experience. Left to wander an empty expanse, the glow of your own body illuminating the ground and sprouting ghostly flowers wherever you go. It’s both calming and tense.

Just weeks after the release of the final wave of DLC for Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, the game has now fallen out of the US "top 20 best-selling games" chart for the first time ever.
As highlighted by GamesIndustry.biz, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe has been in Circana's (formerly The NPD Group) top sales for every month since its arrival in April 2017 (that's apparently 78 consecutive months). While he can't confirm it, industry analyst Mat Piscatella says it's "likely" an all-time record.

Valve also reunited the game's original developers for an hour-long making-of documentary in which its original programmers and artists reminisce about creating the first-person classic at a time when many of them had never shipped a game before.

Chief among the revelations within is that all of Half-Life's textures were created by a single person, Karen Laur.

Animal Crossing: New Horizons took the social simulation to new heights when it launched exclusively on the Switch in 2020, and it's apparently become a source of inspiration for the team at Maxis, who is currently working on the next entry in The Sims series (codenamed "Project Rene").
Speaking on a Radio Times podcast recently, vice president of franchise creative Lyndsay Pearson mentioned how the development team discussed Animal Crossing "all the time" when talking about The Sims 5's multiplayer feature. Nintendo's island entry is supposedly a "good example" of personal spaces and other inventive ideas bringing players together (thanks, IGN):

In an industry where big budget blockbusters are most often sequels, or boringly safe, Aveum feels comparatively bold just by being a self-evidentaly daft first-person mashup of Call Of Duty and Doctor Strange magic powers.

Now it has a demo, so you can try it for free.

Marvel, compared to the other titan of the comics industry, DC, likes to dabble in the bizarre. With Santa Claus himself being an omega-level mutant, it can't be that shocking that old gods like Dagon also share space among the various universes. However, it's surprising how few degrees of separation there are between Peter Paker and eldritch entities.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After years and years of waiting, fans are about to get their deepest look yet at the Dragon’s Dogma sequel. 


Capcom has just announced that a showcase for the game will be held on Tuesday, November 28, at 1PM PST. Fans can tune in for a 15-minute livestream that promises to reveal a ton of new info about the game while also showing off some never-before-seen gameplay. 




The original Dragon’s Dogma debuted all the way back in 2012, and fans have been dying for a sequel ever since. That’s not to say there hasn’t been other Dragon’s Dogma content in the past decade. Netflix released a one-season anime in 2020, and there have been two spinoff games: 2013’s Dragon’s Dogma Arisen and the Japanese exclusive Dragon’s Dogma Online. 


Capcom officially revealed that Dragon’s Dogma 2 was in the works as part of the original game’s 10th anniversary celebration, offering a first real look at the game in June 2023. Destructoid's own Timothy Monbleau got to spend some time hands-on with the game, calling Dragon's Dogma 2 "a game that just wants to be a good ol’ fun time over literally anything else, even if it means getting cheesy or silly." 


So far, it’s looked like Dragon’s Dogma 2 will offer even more of what we all loved about the original, and that would be a definite win. 


The biggest question looming over the upcoming showcase is the game's release date. Capcom hasn’t said anything about that yet, but with director Hideaki Itsuno and producer Yoshiaki Hirabayashi, this would be the perfect time to drop the news. We’ll just have to wait and see.

It's more and more bleak each time, though I do enjoy seeing this progress. I've also now needed to break out thermal layers. I dislike this period when trees are barren and fallen leaves are sludge underfoot but it's not winter. Unpleasant, sure, but not yet thrillingly hostile. Ah well, it'll come.

In Valve's new documentary celebrating the 25th anniversary of the Half-Life series, the company's co-founder Gabe Newell has shared his own thoughts about the differences between a delayed game and a rushed release.
He summed it up as "late is just for a little while, suck is forever" when touching on the challenges Valve faced in the lead-up to the release of Half-Life, which ultimately led to the game's release being pushed back a year.

Epic's popular battle royale Fortnite has just received an "age ratings" update, but it's not gone down so well with the community. This update means islands will now display an age and content rating to help guardians and players "make informed play decisions".

I’ve covered Bucky O’Hare, but there’s also Zen: The Intergalactic Ninja, and this one: Monster in My Pocket.


Monster in My Pocket is more than just a cheeky euphemism, it was this media franchise in the age when everyone wanted a media franchise. Well, it was an attempt at one.

Valve has released the 25th anniversary update, which adds a staggering amount of changes and content to Half-Life including more multiplayer maps, modernized visual options, and the once-magazine exclusive Uplink campaign. 


The update is live now for owners of Half-Life, which likely counts for about 98% of all PC owners. And Valve has made sure nostalgia is set to hit you in the face like an unchecked crowbar right off the bat. The 25th anniversary update brings back the old-school Valve logo to Half-Life, along with the classic menu. This is probably the best way to relive that iconic 'monorail' opener.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Big things are in store for twin-stick actioner Rusted Moss, which confirmed console plans and a major update promising seven to eight hours of new content.


The grapple-happy Metroidvania from developers faxdoc, happysquared, and sunnydaze originally hit PC on April 12, 2023. Next up for the game is a release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch in spring 2024. The team has been working on a big chunk of content that was originally planned for sometime in Q4 2023, but it's being pushed back to coincide with the console launch due to "development and porting adjustments." 


The update will launch on Steam around that time and will be available in the console versions along with all other previously-released updates. As for what the update entails, there are two new areas, over 300 new rooms, and a Boss Rush Mode. There's also a Maya Mode, which lets you play through as Maya for a taste of a new play style. Speedrun mode rules apply there, so just don't expect any new dialogue additions or endings. 


A short teaser was released along with the announcement to show off a tiny slice of new footage:




The footage may be brief, but it definitely sounds like there's a lot for players to look forward to when the update launches. "As you can see, we have probably enjoyed making this update a little too much," the devs said in the announcement. The additional time will give them a chance to finalize code and QA test for consoles, so a little more patience should pay out nicely.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The debate over how long video games should be has raged since the 90s at least. I’ve certainly dipped my toes into this conversation before, including here on Destructoid. But for the recent release of Super Mario RPG, those asking “how long is it” may need a slightly more nuanced answer than usual.


For those just tuning in, the remake of the Super Nintendo classic Super Mario RPG is here. For my part, I absolutely loved reviewing the game. I do think there were missed opportunities with the remake. However, I remain confident in saying that everyone, in one way or another, should experience this adventure. It’s also a $60 remake of a 27-year-old game, and it doesn’t boast the longest run time.


Depending on where you look, you'll maybe see the claim that Super Mario RPG takes 12 hours…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mazes and labyrinths can be confusing, frustrating, oppressive, nightmarish. They are the kinds of structures videogame developers are reluctant to put in their games, because the potential for the player losing heart or patience is relatively high. But as productions, they can be strangely economical, oddly light-footed. Mazes and labyrinths, after all, twist up space and as such, discover or create additional space within space. They allow vast journeys to happen within areas that are modest when judged in terms of square footage, journeys that encompass a multitude of locations that have an inherent, automatic atmosphere: tantalising forks in the path and mocking dead ends, hubs with corridors leading in all directions, leisurely perimeter paths and gristly knots of inner passages.
As such, I think they're useful to reflect on at a time when the mantra of growth for its own sake has conquered the heart of videogame world design: bigger budgets for grander maps in terms of both explorable area and computational resource, all the way to Armageddon (did you know that Suicide Squad's Metropolis is twice the size of Arkham Knight's Gotham City?). But don't take it from me, an armchair developer with armchair socialist sensibilities. Take it from The Legend of Zelda.

Spider-Man sees the friendly neighborhood hero battle a star-studded gallery of villains in an original adventure chock full of comic book goodness. As Spider-Man's first fully 3D action-adventure game, it laid the groundwork for mechanics such as web-swinging, a variety of web shooter attacks, and wall-crawling stealth gameplay. Let's see how it holds up 23 years later.

        <updated>2023-11-17T18:56:24.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the lead-up to Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, Square Enix has shared a recap of the original game’s story, set from the perspective of Red XIII. The recap comes as both Square Enix and fans are counting down the days until Rebirth's release on February 29, 2024.




The recap starts with a description of Midgar and the ShinRa Electric Power Company, set to a chilling rendition of Sephiroth’s theme. As Cloud, Barret and other members of Avalanche are introduced, the music starts to become more hopeful as Cloud meets Aerith following the Sector 8 reactor explosion. It quickly returns to the haunting choral melody as President Shinra and his employees are introduced.


To be honest, the recap does an excellent job of covering the basic plot points from Final Fantasy 7 Remake, though it does bypass the events of the Sector 6 slums, the Wall Market, Don Corneo’s Mansion, and everything else between meeting Aerith and the attack on Sector 7. It also doesn’t mention Zack’s inexplicable revival, which is interesting, given how important he seems to be in Rebirth.


I must admit, though, seeing the fight against Sephiroth at the end of Remake again reminded me of how silly that final act was. Here’s hoping they’re able to make that fight and its ramifications make sense in Rebirth. It’s already been confirmed by Tetsuya Nomura that Rebirth will extend up to The Forgotten Capital, so things are already looking up in that regard. 


Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth launches exclusively for the PlayStation 5 on February 29, 2024.

The Talos Principle II often left me staring at my screen in awe. Sometimes, from sheer intimidation in the face of a seemingly formidable puzzle. Other times,  from my incredulous pride after unraveling said problem. But most of all, the experience regularly gave me pause as I pondered a philosophical idea or argument that challenged my viewpoints on the nature of existence and humanity’s place in the cosmos. These moments spurred me to solve the game’s 100+ puzzles in search of answers, and I’m largely satisfied with what I discovered.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Well, I think this is probably the first and only time I've ever heard British documentarian Adam Curtis appear as an ominous backing sample in an RPG boss battle theme, but in many ways, I hope it's not the last. Forget the operatic choral chants of Final Fantasy bosses. The new rallying cry against peak villainy is now some no-nonsense British commentary about the state of human extinction. It works surprisingly, well, and Small Saga is a game shot through with these kinds of Britishisms, set in the parks, streets and underbelly of modern-day London. 
Only this isn't an RPG about humans, but the rodents that live beneath their feet - the mice, rats, squirrels and moles who have developed a kind of proto-medieval society of their own built from the trash and discarded objects they've scavenged from under our noses. In this world, humans are terrifying 'gods', supermarkets with their shelves of seeds and grain are called 'Heaven', and your main mode of transportation is a pigeon with a wicker basket. It's a fascinating world solo developer Darya Noghani has created here, and it would be a thrilling turn-based RPG, too - if only its battles didn't completely cheese it when it comes to providing any sense of challenge.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ever wondered what it's like to be a 29-year-old overworked Korean man who's never had a girlfriend? Boy, do I have the game for you!


Motesolo: No Girlfriend Since Birth was developed by Indicava Interactive, and as the name suggests, it follows the story of a man named Kimo Kang who's about to turn 30 and wants to finally find a romantic partner. This is no easy feat, as he's awkward, nervous, and unintentionally idiosyncratic. It arrives on November 30 on Nintendo Switch, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S.

Unique and full of heart


Motesolo was originally released in 2021, and it won the Indie Game Award at the Korea Game Awards. It currently sits with a "Very Positive" rating on Steam, but you should be aware of what you're getting yourself into. 


It is a movie game, meaning that the game plays out through live-action scenes. You do have some control, and the way the story pans out depends on your input. For instance, when you're in a cafe waiting for your blind date, you can interact with many things, and even gain some items or information that'll help you on your date. You'll also have to pick dialog options that hopefully lead to a happy ending. 


You can also interact with Kimo's cellphone where you're able to chat with his friends and watch videos that could potentially help you find romantic success. The story isn't entirely about Kimo, however. You also get to learn about his blind date, Yumi, who is willing to give Kimo a chance, but she'll have to deal with his occasionally cringe-inducing behavior. 




It's a funny, heartwarming game that is carried by the good performances and humorous plot. Give it a shot; you may be surprised at how good it is at putting a smile on your face.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hitman: Blood Money was a big hit for the franchise when it was released for PC, PlayStation 2, and Xbox 360 back in 2006. Now, a new set of players can experience the classic stealth title as heads to iOS and Android at the end of November as Hitman: Blood Money - Reprisal.


Feral Interactive, the same studio that brought us a slew of AAA titles to mobile, is back at it again. The developer dropped a trailer for Hitman: Blood Money - Reprisal that shows exactly what iOS and Android users should expect when the game releases on November 30.




The game's visuals remain on par with its PlayStation 2 and Xbox 360 predecessors. But the stealth game's interface has been completely reworked to suit mobile devices. There have also been a few new bells and whistles included for a better overall experience.


Instinct Mode is something that's being brought to Reprisal from later games in the series. It highlights targets and critical mission points to make navigating maps a bit easier. 


A mini-map is also being introduced to Blood Money for the first time. It offers better feedback on Agent 47's surroundings, including alerts if the character is raising suspicions. As in the original, there are 12 sandbox missions for players to enjoy over and over again due to their highly replayable nature.


Controls for Hitman: Blood Money - Reprisal have been reworked, too so that users can create a UI that fits them best on the go. However, those who wish to utilize a gamepad or keyboard and mouse have that option too. 


Hitman: Blood Money - Reprisal sneaks up on iOS and Android users on November 30. It's listed in the App Store and Google Play Store for $14.99. A Nintendo Switch port is also planned for some point in the winter.

Nobody must know! Oh drat. Anyway, despite my lack of expertise, the Supergiant action-roguelite was the first comparison that came to mind while watching the trailer for Realm of Ink, which has just been announced.


It makes use of a similar angled perspective, appears similarly focussed on build customisation, with hundreds of magic items to equip, and sees you playing out the backstories of various mythological personalities - derived, in this case, not from Ancient Greece but China and Buddhism.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Final Fantasy VII Rebirth arrives in February, which isn’t too far on the horizon, so Square Enix is getting players prepared with a cinematic refresher of its predecessor, Final Fantasy VII Remake. The company pairs that with a batch of fresh screenshots and art, including the first glimpse of the Highwind airship. 
The video sees Red XIII narrate the broad strokes of the 2020 adventure. While it doesn’t touch on the finer details and background of the characters, it provides a decent summary that's perhaps better served as a reminder for fans who played Remake rather than someone coming into Rebirth completely fresh. Unfortunately, the recap doesn’t touch on the events of the Intermission expansion that introduces Yuffie, who joins the party in Rebirth, so unfamiliar players will have to do their own homework on that. 


Square has released some new images, including a piece of art depicting Aerith in front of the Highwind. The screenshots show off the town of Kalm, the summon Kujata, the abandoned Mythril Mine, and a few side characters. Oh, and Chadley is there too. 

Final Fantasy VII Rebirth launches on February 29 for PlayStation 5. You can watch us play two demos of the game in this video and read our hands-on impressions here. You can also get the answers to some of Rebirth's burning questions in this interview with Square Enix.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Update, 11/20/23:
Last week, developer Epic Games updated Fortnite to include a new rating restriction that applies to certain skins. Depending on a Fortnite skin, it might only be useable on a creative island with a T rating, meaning the Resident Evil Claire Redfield skin, which features a pistol in a holster on her thigh, can't be used on islands rated less than Teen. Players were upset with this change as it made skins they paid real money for (often $10 to $20 per skin) unusable in all the ways they might have previously been usable. 
Epic said only 7 percent of Fortnite skins are only usable on Teen-rated islands, at the time, but it's clear enough skins are affected to have the community unhappy with this update.

I love how it looks, I love what it does, and I will endlessly admire how its little multi-coloured building bricks morph and shift, smooshed together in far more creative ways than I could ever manage myself. But when presented with a blank canvas and no direction on what to do with said multi-coloured building bricks, my mind seizes up and straight up refuses to extract any joy from it. It's a feeling I fear will apply to the equally charming Tiny Glade when that eventually comes out as well, based on the very lovely GIFs I've seen of it so far, and honestly, there are times when I worry my brain is just a teeny bit broken and I have lost the ability to find joy in what are clearly very joyful little creations.
But then I play games like Pile Up!, a micro citybuilder that's very much in the same vein as Townscaper, and realise, oh no, I do just need some objectives and structure to my game playing for everything to be fine again.

This goes doubly so now that SteamOS 3.5.5 has officially come out, allowing you to tune your colour vibrancy and more.


Indeed, no longer do you need to rely on third-party plugins to tweak your Steam Deck's display: the long-awaited SteamOS update 3.5 is now available for download, and it includes some big must-have features for the older model of the device. Do expect some performance and stability improvements, of course, but the biggest draw here is absolutely the new colour settings interface, where you're free to customize the Deck's display image output however you wish.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Former Dragon Age: Dreadwolf production director and veteran Mass Effect scribe Mac Walters has founded a new studio, Worlds Untold, with funding from NetEase. According to the official site, the studio will develop "triple-A action adventure games with an emphasis on narrative and worldbuilding": its first project is a single-player-focussed, "near future action adventure game in a breathtaking world filled with mystery and exploration". 


Amongst other things, this reflects Walter's desire to move away from the "space opera" RPGs he's made in the past and develop a more linear, story-driven sci-fi game, whose universe might also host TV or novel adaptations. Which might not sound very appealing to BioWare diehards, but you can rest easy on one count: the game will have plenty of lore, though how it's served up to the player is another question.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In terms of straight-up savings, the best early Black Friday gaming laptop deals are surely the most generous among pre-Christmas games tech discounts. True, they’re pricier than any gaming mouse or Steam Deck accessory to begin with, but basic principles of proportions mean that the choicest deals will lop off enormous wads of cash.
And these are quality lappies, too. Some of my personal favourites (the Gigabyte Aorus 15X! The Razer Blade 14! The Acer Nitro 5, if you’re on a budget!) have made into Black Friday’s early deal highlights, and there are plenty more besides. Most of them are rocking up-to-date Nvidia GeForce RTX 40 series GPUs, too, so they’ll be able to handle ray tracing and roid their own performance via DLSS 3. To varying extents, naturally.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Reports suggested Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 was a crunch-driven 16 month project, and our campaign review thought it displayed characteristics of a rushed schedule-filler. Besides quality gunplay and a fantastic array of classic maps, MW3's multiplayer doesn't do much to differentiate itself from MW2, aside from being more of a frustrating grind. And its awkwardly positioned zombies mode, though it might appeal to some, has been robbed of its sickle-sharpening soul. All of it does smack of being rushed, and I'd only recommend the game if you're an ardent fan of COD who's happy to accept little in the way of changes. Otherwise, this FPS simply isn't worth spending your hard-earned bucks on.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At the time of Star Fleet II: Krellan Commander's release, I was still learning to spell and wrestling with the whole "going to the toilet independently" business, but if I'd had access to an MS-DOS PC between potty-training sessions, I dare say I'd have tried my hand at being an intergalactic warlord. Originally published in 1989 by Interstel Corporation and distributed by a little-known company called Electronic Arts, it's an absurdly in-depth and fiddly-looking space sim in which you fly around a randomly generated cosmos in your horrible Klingon-adjacent battlecruiser, blowing up or commandeering other ships, bombarding or invading planets, and generally speaking being a nuisance. 


According to its creators, Trevor Sorensen and Mark Baldwin, the game had a rushed launch that led to a lot of technical issues. The developers released another, relatively bug-free version in 1991, which is the version you'll find on most retro game preservation sites. Then, in 2018, Sorensen decided to make a new 2.0 version of Krellan Commander using his original 486 PC, which finally launched this week on Steam and GOG.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As reports of a second season of The Last of Us circulate, there is also word that a native PS5 version of The Last of Us Part 2 may be on the way.


The news comes from PlayStation dataminer @PlayStationSize who posted a somewhat cryptic Tweet featuring the Naughty Dog sequel. Industry Insider's Tom Henderson contacted the account and confirmed that "the tweet refers to The Last of Us Part II as a native version being added to the PlayStation database."




 This seems to align with what game composer Gustavo Santaolalla previously hinted at in an interview with BLENDER. In the interview, he also claimed that in the PS5 version players would be able to interact with his character and make him play music.

Back in the '90s, Nintendo played faster and looser with its library of characters. Sometimes Yoshi showed up in The Legend of Zelda, and Kirby was whatever color he felt like at the moment, be it gray or pink. In 1996, that laissez-faire attitude was in full effect for the release of Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars for the Super Nintendo. Link, Samus, and even Donkey Kong (sort of) all had inexplicable cameos in the game, and one of my big questions about the remake was whether or not those would move forward.

Culex appears in Super Mario RPG remake as he did in the original game, which is to say he is a pixelated, 2D creature. He also features the original throwback soundtrack and sound effects. You access him the same way, too – by buying fireworks and trading them with the little girl nearby in Moletown for a shiny stone. You then use that shiny stone in Monstro Town on the locked door.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Steam Deck OLED releases today, providing a new avenue for game players (especially those with big Steam libraries) to take their gaming experience on the go. The new OLED models (one at 512 GB and another at 1TB storage) effectively replace the original release as the new Steam Deck flagship hardware. The older 64 GB and 512 GB LCD models are being phased out, while the 256 GB LCD will remain available at a reduced price.
Steam Deck OLED is not a fundamentally new platform. In many ways that matter, our review of the original still stands, and snagging one of the older LCD screen models is now an even more substantial value at the lower price. However, several of the concerns that surfaced in that review have been remedied by the new model – enough that a new evaluation is warranted.

And then, in a bit of a meta twist, we hung out with Humanity co-developer and publisher Enhance and discussed how we made our making-of documentary. Even cooler, we made a Game Informer level within Humanity – and you can play it now.
All this happened on the "HUMANITY Hub Community Stream," where myself (Blake) and Alex Van Aken discussed why we decided to make a documentary on Humanity, how we crafted the video, and even cutting-room floor content that didn't make the final product. We closed the show by putting our collective brains together to make a level based on the GI logo.
You can check out an archived version of the stream below:


By no means is our Humanity level an official partnership between Enhance and GI, but it's certainly a fun way to end a project that was a months-long labor of love.

Unlike with the original Steam Deck’s launch, Valve say the much-upgraded OLED version arrives with ample stock, so buyers can hopefully get theirs posted out without delay. The familiar reservation system is "ready to switch on", though, should demand overwhelm supply.

The PCs on this list, some of which have several hundred pounds/dollars off their usual prices, are testament to that.

It’s all proven just too dangerous for Alan Wake 2 devs Remedy Entertainment, who’ve rebooted their upcoming F2P shooter Vanguard as a more traditional paid game. We later return to our core competences, in press release-speak, to talk about the Steam Deck OLED and the games we’ve been playing this week.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The ocean planet of GUP-14 is not a happy place. Its seabed has been gunked up with piles of trash, globs of purple gunge and nasty clouds of micro-plastics, all because an industrial megacorp couldn't be bothered to clean up after themselves after bleeding it for resources. That megacorp's since upped sticks to, sadly, continue their terrible ways somewhere else in the solar system, but calling out these bad practices (beyond them being obviously bad and not good for the planet) is not really Loddlenaut's concern here. 
Rather, your job is to simply clean up this mess with your array of high-tech gadgetry, healing its polluted environments so: a) it's not a grim, purple hellscape anymore; b) native, axolotl-like loddle creatures can move back in and prosper. It's simple, satisfying work that's designed to make you feel warm and fuzzy inside without having to think too hard. But its straightforward, frictionless tale may leave some wishing it had just a little more bite, and less of a sense that you're laying the ground for some other faceless corpo power to go and splurge all over it again.

Rather, the Portal allows you to connect to a PS5 you already have in your home over your Wi-Fi network (or any Wi-Fi network) and play the games you have downloaded on that PS5 from other places around your home.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Naheulbeuk’s Dungeon Master is a staff management game disguised as a dungeon management game. At the start of each week, your minions might choose to go on strike, demanding everything from more cells in the prison to fewer dwarves in the workplace. If that second example elicited a startled little “yikes”, then good, you’re paying attention. Your minions are also occasional racists – which at least makes some of the more brutal options at hand for dealing with striking workers more palatable.


You can sacrifice the entire picket line to your in-house demon lord, or terminate their employment without tribunal. You can also lock them up in those prisons they repeatedly claim are so lacking in cells. Or you can agree to their terms to expand the canteen and sack all of their shortest colleagues. But no matter which option you choose, minion strikes are inconsequential, only ever amounting to a comedy aside. Just as the turn-based Dungeon Of Naheulbeuk set out to skewer D&D, Naheulbeuk’s Dungeon Master is a brave and self-aware parody of dungeon management games. But it's far too barebones to invest in seriously.

Following in the wake of Microsoft, Epic, CD Projekt, Sony and, well, take your pick, the company aim to cut roughly 30% of their workforce to shore up profits. The specific reasoning here is that Digital Bros think that people aren't interested in playing original new games; they'd rather get to grips with fictions and franchises they know and love already. As such, the company plan to "limit" their big budget projects in future, though no specific cancellations have been announced.

Does Nintendo’s remake of the retro gem on Switch do it justice?…

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recent GPUs, glisteningly muscled as they are, remain expensive. Enter the best early Black Friday graphics cards deals, offering up some rare opportunities to upgrade your PC’s most gaming-focused component without the usual financial devastation.
I’m exaggerating – for effect! – but there genuinely are some chunky savings to be had here, even on the very latest graphics cards with enhanced ray tracing and DLSS 3 support. It’s not just super-duper-high-end cards like the RTX 4080 that are getting cuts, either – the early deals I’ve found so far cover more affordable and/or mid-range far as well, like the Intel Arc A750 and RTX 4060 Ti. And there could be more to come, with Black Friday itself not rolling around until November 24th.

There are already many mods for the venerable fantasy RPG, of course - the options range from mods that give you Henry Cavill's face to mods that simulate the effects of long Covid to raise awareness - but the editor should make life easier for the internet's Geralt-whisperers. Better late than never.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Have you ever watched critically acclaimed 1998 comedy drama The Truman Show and thought "What if the whole city was people who didn't know they were in a TV show?". That's kind of the deal with American Arcadia, a puzzle-platformer about a dude who lives in an ultra advanced dome city that is for some reason 70s-themed, and is also a huge reality show for the Twitch generation. 
I actually love the 70s theme. This combined with story-within-a-story-within-a-story framing, bits of lovely, almost Wes Anderson-esque art design, and some extreme multi-tasking combining 2.5D and 3D makes American Arcadia an interesting little treat. Do the twists upon twists get a bit over cooked? Maybe. But you can live with it.

The PlayStation 5 was the best-selling console of the month, too. 
Marvel's Spider-Man 2 taking the top slot last month isn't surprising – it's the fastest-selling PlayStation Studios game ever and sold through 5 million copies in just 11 days.


Behind Marvel's Spider-Man 2 on October 2023's best-selling list is Super Mario Bros. Wonder, the latest Switch exclusive from Nintendo at-the-time, and Assassin's Creed Mirage, the shorter throwback title from Ubisoft starring Assassin's Creed Valhalla's Basim.

Notably, CDPR says this mod editor for The Witcher 3 will allow players to create their own experiences in the game, meaning people can develop their own fantasy adventures starring everyone's favorite monster hunter.

The original Super Mario RPG, released for Super Nintendo in 1996, felt like it was meant to be your first RPG. In an era when Final Fantasy tried its best to tell mature stories within the medium's limitations and Dragon Quest demanded hours and hours of your time, Mario’s adventure felt much brighter and more manageable. Familiar characters, a lighthearted story, a reasonable length, and timed button-pressing during combat made it stand out against the competition. Revisiting the game more than 25 years later in this new remade shape shows the original formula did n…]]></summary>

That update is now out and it includes free cosmetic items, some bug fixes, and balance changes that should make the game easier.

It says it is doing so to align with "the new competitive market." 505 Games is the publisher behind games like Ghostrunner 2, Control, Payday 2, the PC version of Death Stranding, and more; it's unclear how much of that team will be affected by Digital Bros' overall plan. 
"Digital Bros has reviewed its projects to align with the new competitive environment," it writes in a press release.

It’s powered by what the developers are calling “living ink”, an art style that fills in each papery map as you play. 


The game certainly looks arresting: your cursor is a quill, the HUD is a collection of smaller parchment scraps, and the terrain is a slowly brightening wash of swirling colours, leaking beyond the outlines of trees and buildings. Lovely stuff. And what's more, you get to beat up a bunch of wolves.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tactical extraction shooter Escape From Tarkov is adding vaulting, a recoil rework and new armour, as revealed in a developer livestream. Of the bunch, it's vaulting - the act of clambering over a low wall - which has been greeted most feverishly by Tarkov's community, a fact which is honestly not surprising.

Well, you probably would, because it's Minecraft, the sandbox building sim that contains all possibility and all human endeavour, with the exception of good PvP mechanics, yes I went there. 


Anyway, Minecraft update 1.21 is just around the corner, and a few players have gotten early access via Mojang's snapshot releases. I had thought the crown jewel of the update would be the new Trial Chambers, aka trap-filled mazes. It turns out the real star might be the new Breeze mob - in the hands of imaginative players, at least.

Shantae Advance: Risky Revolution was arguably the most interesting title. Developer WayForward began development on the game 20 years ago, but never completed it. Next year, the game will finally make its way to Switch, but retain the Game Boy Advance aesthetic it was always meant to have.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Persona 5 kids are trapped in high school, their semesters stretched into infinity by the inescapable march of spin-offs that have been retroactively stuffed into every available blank spot. Since the credits rolled on Persona 5 (and also before, and sometimes concurrently), the Phantom Thieves have spent their time in a rubbish Dynasty Warriors knock-off, got lost in a dream about a really cheap rhythm-action game and ended up trapped in a cross-generational dungeon crawler. Now they find themselves embroiled in - of all things - an X-COM style turn-based strategy game. 


Your energy for Persona 5 Tactica is going to come down to how much tolerance you have for the Persona 5 brand’s Baz Luhrmann-style maximalism. If you're emotionally invested in the gang, it'll definitely help. But even if you're a Persona veteran or a total newcomer, you'll find the story a bit loose, the chats a bit tiring, and the combat a bit simplistic. Then again, if you're a Persona fan, it's still more than a good excuse to sink back into another adventure with your pals.

Persona 5 has become its own sort of mini-franchise within the Persona series. With many spin-off titles released over the years, such as Persona 5 Strikers, Persona 5: Dancing in Starlight, and Persona Q2: New Cinema Labyrinth, Atlus seems to love using Persona 5’s popularity to explore new stories and gameplay ideas. However, I applaud Atlus for making all of these spin-offs in completely different genres from each other. The latest, Persona 5 Tactica, delivers an entertaining story, a colorful cast of charact…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Making a strategy game is "harder than people give it credit for," Bit Reactor's CEO Greg Foertsch tells me. The same could probably be said of any game this year in particular, but having spent over 20 years shepherding the art teams at Firaxis on Civilization, XCOM, Sid Meier's Pirates, Alpha Centauri and most recently Marvel's Midnight Suns, Foertsch has seen firsthand what it takes for strategy games to break new ground over the years, and what an arduous road it's been for the genre to get where it is today. Not only was it "late to party on 3D, they were late to the party on consoles," but it's also "suffered from lower budgets, which means it just hasn't pushed in the way that other genres have," he says. 
Even now, "it's got some catching up to do," he continues, but there are plenty of reasons to be positive, too. As we speak at the beginning of September, our conversation quickly turns to Baldur's Gate 3, whose enormous success Foertsch cites as a clear and obvious sign that "there's a thirst for something different now," both within RPG circles and, perhaps a little unexpectedly, for strategy heads as well. It's his hope that his own upcoming project, the closely guarded Star Wars strategy game his new studio Bit Reactor are working on in collaboration with Respawn, will follow in these lauded footsteps. "We want to make a game and just have people say, 'Man, that's amazing game, and oh, it happens to be strategy.' That's the goal."

Much like The Boys, it's got a not-very-nice version of Superman, Omni-Man, who you might have seen doing not-very-nice things in Mortal Kombat lately.
Skybound and Kirkman's first videogame based on the license isn't about Omni-Man, though. Developed by Terrible Posture Games, it's about Atom Eve, a high-school do-gooder who can manipulate the atomic structure of the world, changing one thing into another.

Victory is dependent on rapidly issuing movement, attack and ability commands to several small squads of soldiers, and your units will pay a heavy price if your attention leaves them for more than a few moments.

If that's not your thing, move along. If it is, Realms Of Ruin is a solid, button-down war 'em up and you should read on.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you’ve been enjoying Jusant, Don’t Nod’s post-apocalyptic climbing sim, you might also like the alpha playtest for Chasing The Unseen, which has just been updated with a new level. It doesn’t have Jusant’s quietly innovative grip and abseiling mechanics – the climbing is closer to Shadow Of The Colossus, consisting of just one button you hold to cling on till your stamina runs out. Nor does it have the Don’t Nod game's beautifully nested chunks of backstory - no seashells you can press your ear to, alas. But it does have massive flying cephalopods, giant red mushrooms, and floating, fractured landscapes of rock and grass. 

The gameworld drifts whimsically between categories, neither macroscopic nor microscopic, at times a kind of ocean reef, and at other times, a mysterious, alternate dimension we might summarise as “Cthulhu’s Zen Chillout Room”. The climbing aside, you can glide short distances by inflating what looks like a blowfish, and there are (regular-sized) capybara to chase down and collect. When you die, the game plays a didgeridoo at you in a faintly jocular way. The whole thing pongs of quantum physics.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lies of P is one of the year's best games – read why in Game Informer's Lies of P review – and both critics and fans have enjoyed the Bloodborne/Sekiro-style take on the story of The Adventures of Pinocchio. Mustakro on Twitter has taken their enjoyment of the game's boss designs and turned some of Lies of P's toughest challenges into Cuphead-style bosses, and it rules. 


I came across Mustakro this morning, scrolling through my Twitter feed, when I saw a really awesome rendition of Lies of P's King of Puppets boss (one of the most difficult in the game) in the style of Rubberhose, which is that classic animation style popularized in the 1920s seen in Cuphead.

Then I clicked through some of Mustakro's other tweets to find even more Lies of P bosses in the style of Cuphead, and I love these renditions so much that I just wanted to share. So, enjoy their other art below:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Shadows of Doubt is the voxel-based 1980s detective sim in which the glass is always rain-slicked, the coffee as bitter as the human soul, and the whodunnits, procedurally generated. Hard-nosed private eye Rachel (RPS in peace) pronounced herself fascinated but a little stumped by it, back in April, while Graham described it as his "ideal game" in a post about the recent addition of infidelity cases and lost-and-found jobs, adding to my suspicions that Graham is some kind of jigsaw killer and that his news posts are actually ciphered confessions of his terrible crimes.
Well, these already viscous plots are about to thicken into a borderline-immobile soup of intrigue, for ColePowered Games are adding modding tools to the game. These will allow you to pen your own detective mysteries, and even alter the surrounding city to fit.

Call of Duty cycles through its lineup of villains on a yearly basis. Sometimes it's Nazis, other times it's Russian nationalists or zombies. But the most dangerous threat is one without a lust for brains or access to weapons of war; it's stagnation. And while many Call of Duty teams often switch up just enough variables to stave off monotony, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III fully submits to the annual churn.

Whether it's selecting the next movie on your living room media PC, changing settings on your racing rig or getting your Steam Deck set up just the way you want it, having a convenient, all-in-one wireless option can be just the ticket. 
Logitech's K400 Plus is a popular model in this niche category, and normally retails for an affordable $28. Today though, it's down to $19 on Amazon, a sweet 32% discount that makes it near impulse buy territory for anyone that has a PC for which a regular mouse and keyboard setup isn't quite convenient.

        <updated>2023-11-13T19:59:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After months of character reveals, Tekken 8 has announced the final fighter of its launch roster: Reina. This brand-new character sports a lightning-quick moveset, earning her the nickname “Purple Lightning," and has mysterious ties to the Mishima clan.
Bandai Namco states that little is known about Reina's history besides she’s a student of the Mishima Polytechnical School. For some reason, she really wants to fight Jin (move over, Hwoarang), and based on her gameplay trailer, she seems more than capable of taking him on. Check Reina out in action below. 


With Reina’s addition, the 32-fighter roster is now complete. Here’s the full list of characters, with new fighters denoted and links to applicable articles/trailers:
Alisa Bosconovitch
Asuka Kazama
Azucena Milagros Ortiz Castillo (New)
Bryan Fury
Claudio Serafino
Devil Jin
Feng Wei
Hwoarang
Jack-8 (New)
Jin Kazma
Jun Kazama
Kazuya Mishima/Devil Kazuya
King
Kuma
Lars Alexandersson
Lee Chaolan
Leo Kliesen
Leroy Smith
Lili Rochefort
Ling Xiaoyu
Marshall Law
Nina Williams
Panda
Paul Phoenix
Raven
Reina (New)
Sergei Dragunov
Shaheen
Steve Fox
Victor Chevalier (New)
Yoshimitsu
Zafina
Additionally, the game's first Season of post-launch DLC will add four unannounced fighters. These characters will be released separately each season throughout 2024, with the first arriving sometime in the spring. 
Tekken 8 launches on January 26 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. Check our early hands-on impressions of the game here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Amazon is laying off 180 jobs in its games division, hopping on the tragically overcrowded bandwagon of layoffs in the game industry this year. The news comes via Aftermath, which reports that the layoffs are focused in two areas – the Crown Twitch channel, which will reportedly be eliminated altogether, and the game growth teams. Employees were notified of the changes through an email from Christoph Hartman, VP of Amazon Games. This is the second wave of layoffs this division of the company has faced this year.
An excerpt of the announcement email can be read below:
There have been so many layoffs in the gaming industry this year that it's getting hard to keep track of. Last week, we learned Free Radical Design is on the verge of closing down and that Ubisoft laid off more than 100 employees. The week before that, roughly 100 employees were laid off at Destiny 2 developer Bungie. 
In January, Microsoft laid off 10,000 employees amidst its ongoing $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard, which it completed last month. 
In August, Striking Distance Studios, the team behind last year's The Callisto Protocol, laid off more than 30 employees, and that same month, Mass Effect and Dragon Age developer BioWare laid off 50 employees, including long-time studio veterans. The following month, in September, Immortals of Aveum developer Ascendant Studios laid off roughly 45% of its staff. 
Just last month, The Last of Us developer Naughty Dog laid off at least 25 employees, and Telltale Games underwent layoffs as well, although an actual number of laid-off employees has not yet been revealed. And in late October, Dreams developer Media Molecule laid off 20 employees.
The hearts of Game Informer's staff are with the people laid off from Amazon Games, along with everyone else who has lost a job this year.

It's at a very early stage, with a core team that currently includes Cyberpunk 2077 game director Gabriel Amatangelo, narrative director Igor Sarinski and Sarah Gruemmer, expert quest designer, who worked on the storyline for Judy Alvarez in the previous game. They've all moved or are in the process of moving from Poland to Boston in the USA, where CD Projekt have opened a new office. One of the major challenges, right now, is getting to grips with Epic's Unreal Engine.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this summer, developer Evening Star Studios and publisher Private Division revealed Penny's Big Breakaway during a Nintendo Direct. While the throwback 3D platforming adventure looked great in its own right, what caught a lot of people's attention was the team behind it. Evening Star's creative director and lead engine architect is Christian Whitehead, one of the lead developers behind 2017's Sonic Mania. Whitehead isn't alone, though, as various other Evening Star developers also worked on Sonic Mania. While we've still got some time before the game's release – it's due out sometime in 2024 – Game Informer has a special sneak peek at its music and can exclusively reveal three tracks from the game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alan Wake and Control developers Remedy Entertainment have announced that their untitled co-op shooter, the artist formerly known as project Vanguard, will no longer be a free-to-play game - largely, it seems, because the free-to-play business is looking a bit dicey. The game has been given a new codename to celebrate: Kestrel. It's still a co-op multiplayer affair, however.


The reboot follows an evaluation period during which Remedy and publisher Tencent discussed a proof-of-concept version of the game, as we reported last month. They've now kicked it back to the concept phase "due to uncertainties in creating a successful game [in] the rapidly changing free-to-play market and associated risks". A few members of the old Vanguard development team have moved to other Remedy projects, while the core leadership and certain select developers carry on with Kestrel.

More specifically, the next Indie World Showcase will air at 9 a.m. PT/Noon ET tomorrow, on November 14.

November 13, 2023
As with every Indie World Showcase, the question must be asked: is this the time where we finally see Hollow Knight: Silksong, the Hollow Knight sequel from developer Team Cherry that began life as a DLC to the original game? It probably won't be but it's always fun to get your hopes up a little bit so that they may be gently crushed. 
Tomorrow's Indie World Showcase for Nintendo Switch begins at Noon ET. 
In the meantime, read Game Informer's Hollow Knight review and then check out everything announced during the last Indie World Showcase, which was held in April, for a glance at what to potentially expect with tomorrow's.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Studio Ghibli's Spirited Away is a film about a spoilt young girl who is obliged to work at a bathhouse for supernatural creatures, after her parents are turned into pigs by a wicked witch. Spirittea from Edmonton, Canada-based Cheesemaker Games is Spirited Away in the guise of a Stardew Valley-style management sim. Released today, it casts you as a wholesome young entrepreneur who has just arrived in a town full of rogue supernatural creatures. To free the town from its spectral infestation, you must renovate an old mountain bathhouse and treat each phantom to a jolly good scrub. You might also need to deal with some Unfinished Business, such as tracking down a lost possession. At least there's no witch to worry about. That I know of, anyway.


I have fond memories of Spirited Away - it was the film that re-introduced me to anime as an undergraduate, following the traditional early-career middlebrow otaku phase of obsessing over Akira, Cowboy Bebop and Ghost in the Shell while turning my nose up at stuff like Naruto, because it's "just for kids". I was on the brink of pitching a Spirittea review, but then our reviews editor Ed Thorn emerged howling and gibbering from the floorboards and asked me to review a 100-hour RPG instead (won't spoil), so I'll have to settle for trying the demo.

I would like to propose an analogous theory for horror games and cute games whereby past a certain point of cuteness, the videogame in question teeters over dramatically into dread and nausea. We could call it the "horseshuwu effect".


As evidence of this, please witness the unholy magnificence of Saccharinity of Starfield, a Starfield mod from lucyprrrr and the Sakura Candy Society, which treats Starfield's items, spaceships, buildings, vegetation, planet models and, worst of all, people to a barbie-doll makeover reminiscent of a seriously overclocked shoujo anime.

Looking at you, Starfield and Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty. Little scamps.

As such, I'm tickled gall-bladder-pink to hear that Blizzard consider the action-RPG series "a wonderful platform" for different types of game, now that they've made the leap to an open world format. 


For the most part, said experimentation will occur in the course of Diablo 4 expansions - the first of which, Diablo 2 throwback Vessel of Hatred, will launch in late 2024, adding a new class to the game described as "never before seen in the Diablo universe". But from the sounds of things, there's scope for the "franchise in general" to evolve too.

So it is in Mob Factory, a blend of tower defense and factory management in which you quickly set up defenses against waves of worms, spiders, skeletons and so forth - and then set up spawners to create more waves, so you can turn their fallen remains into conveyor belts, walls, and eventually new islands to expand your monster-chewing factories upon. It just came out on Steam.

The only issue is that the 1997 original is a little ugly and constrained by modern standards.

Enter KeeperFx, a long-running open source project to make the original Dungeon Keeper run at higher resolutions, with widescreen support, improved AI, online multiplayer, modern controls and user-made levels. After fifteen years of on-off development, it just hit 1.0.

In the wake of the expansion announcement and seasonal reveals that rolled out about Diablo IV, we had the chance to speak with Diablo franchise manager Rod Fergusson and game director Joe Shely. We asked about the studio’s development processes post-launch, the specifics of gathering and responding to fan feedback and criticism, and the most critical priorities for Diablo IV in the months following launch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Put your sleuthing caps on, detectives—it’s time to solve some mysteries! We are proud to announce that a whole batch of HeR Interactive’s Nancy Drew games are now ready for public testing:
In Nancy Drew: Stay Tuned for Danger, a soap opera star needs your help in uncovering who is behind a series of death threats that sound a little too real for comfort. 
Nancy Drew: Message in a Haunted Mansion has you helping out with repairs in a Victorian mansion. However, a series of strange accidents, plus some murmurings of a ghost haunting, quickly threaten to turn this renovation into an investigation.
In Nancy Drew: Treasure in the Royal Tower a failed ski vacation at an eccentric castle with even more eccentric inhabitants soon turns into a quest to uncover a lost piece of the history of the French Revolution.
And if you’re looking for something more thrilling, in Nancy Drew: The Final Scene, you will find yourself racing against the clock to find your kidnapped friend, while also saving a historical theater with more than a fair share of secrets from demolition.
The games are available for purchase through HeR Interactive’s website or Steam (Stay Tuned for Danger is not available on Steam, however). Or if you already own a CD copy of the games, their English and Russian variants will also work. To play them with ScummVM, you will need a daily development build. As always, if you encounter any issues, please submit a bug report to our issue tracker.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you've seen Netflix's Arcane League of Legends animated series, there's a high probability you really like it – the show's great, even for non-League of Legends fans. It tells the heartwrenching story of sisters Vi and Jinx and their struggle to come to terms with each other in the high-tech (and magical) utopian city of Piltover and its seedy underbelly known as Zaun. The first season hit the subscription streaming service in November of 2021and now we know that Arcane Season 2 hits Netflix this time next year. 
More specifically, Arcane Season 2 drops on Netflix in November of 2024. To coincide with the news, Netflix has released a short teaser featuring Jinx. Check it out below:

With roughly a year to go before Season 2, if you haven't yet watched Arcane, which features voice actors like Hailee Steinfeld, Yuri Lowenthal, Ella Purnell, and more, you've got plenty of time to do so – and it's well worth your time!
In the meantime, check out the League of Legends Jinx champion skin that was added to Fortnite to celebrate Arcane, and then read Game Informer's review of Ruined King: A League of Legends story. Read about Convergence: A League of Legends Story after that.

Originally slated to release in 2021, the project has quietly remained in limbo for years, but developer Thekla Inc. has revealed that it’s finally arriving on April 30. 
Braid was first released for Xbox 360's Live Arcade on August 6, 2008, and stars Tim, a boy searching for a princess captured by a monster. The 2D platformer centers on time manipulation mechanics that players utilize to solve puzzles and locate/assemble jigsaw pieces.

A week later, in a quarterly financial results briefing, Sony CFO Hiroki Totoki revealed that PlayStation planned to launch more than 10 live service games by March 2026, with Bungie helping the company in the space. In an earnings call held today, Totoki stated that of its 12 live service games, it will only release six by Fiscal Year 2025, which ends March 2026, as reported by VideoGamesChronicle. 
Earlier this year, Bloomberg reported that Bungie was evaluating some of PlayStation's in-development offerings, including Naughty Dog's Last of Us multiplayer project, which is reportedly on ice.

If you purchase a new Gundam model kit at your local store today, it originated in this facility in Shizuoka, Japan. The factory contains 35 plastic color-molding machines – 25 electric and 10 hydraulic – all helping produce millions of models yearly.
Bandai Spirits employee Miyuki Nakagiri, the subject matter expert on how exactly the factory operates, escorts us through the building. Our translator during this tour is Atsuo Yoshimura, a video game production manager who’s worked at Bandai Namco for the last 17 years. Notably, Yoshimura worked on last year’s Elden Ring – Game Informer’s 2022 Game of the Year, and most recently, Armored Core VI Fires of Rubicon. Additionally, Yoshimura was instrumental in helping to coordinate Game Informer’s recent Armored Core VI cover story trip.

We also learned yesterday the Switch has surpassed 132 million units sold on the heels of great results for The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and Pikmin 4.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rockstar Games will release the first trailer for its highly anticipated sequel to 2013's Grand Theft Auto V, which became the most profitable entertainment product of all time in 2018, next month. As of August, Grand Theft Auto V has sold more than 185 million copies since its release 10 years ago. 
Official news of this trailer from the Rockstar Twitter account comes less than a day after a Bloomberg report that states Rockstar will reveal the sequel, presumably titled Grand Theft Auto VI or Grand Theft Auto 6, this week with a trailer for it arriving sometime next month; Since the release of this report yesterday, Rockstar has confirmed a trailer for the next Grand Theft Auto will, in fact, be released in December. 
We are very excited to let you know that in early December, we will release the first trailer for the next Grand Theft Auto. We look forward to many more years of sharing these experiences with all of you.
November 8, 2023
Game Informer has reached out to Rockstar's parent company Take-Two Interactive to ask about this report and reveal and will update the story if more information is learned. 
The journey to the reveal of the next Grand Theft Auto has not happened quietly. In September of last year, unprecedented leaks gave fans a potential look at the sequel in over 90 videos showcasing secret in-development footage of the open-world crime sequel.  We also learned last year that the game reportedly stars a female protagonist. Bloomberg says this Grand Theft Auto V sequel is set in a fictional version of Miami and features the aforementioned female protagonist as well as a male protagonist. 


While waiting to learn more about Rockstar's next game, read Game Informer's Grand Theft Auto V review and then read our thoughts on Red Dead Redemption II. After that, read Game Informer's ranking of every single Rockstar game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Revenant Hill, the next game by the makers of Night in the Woods, has been canceled. The reason is that the game's narrative designer and artist Scott Benson is battling a severe illness that has forced him to step away from the project.
Benson reveals on his personal X account that he’s been suffering severe heart failure over the past 12 months, which has greatly limited his ability to work. You can read his post below. 
So. Over the past 12 months or so I got very sick and it didn't go away. Eventually I was diagnosed with severe heart failure, most likely from a virus. It will continue to greatly limit me for the foreseeable future and as such I've had to stop working in the manner I once did.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are very pleased to announce today the start of the testing period of two single-game engines: Kingdom: The Far Reaches and Escape From Hell!
Kingdom, was developed and released by Interplay in 1995. Only the DOS version of the game (available on gog.com) is supported. It's a cartoon FMV game, with an inventory, in which you have to guide Lathan Kandor through a medieval world, discovering the magic spells and the items required to defeat an evil wizard. 
Escape From Hell, was developed for Electronic Arts by the game veterans Richard Seaborne and Alan Murphy and was released in 1990. You play Alan in this keyboard-only Role Playing Game and visit Hell, looking for your girlfriend who was accidentally teleported there.
Both games use heavily hardcoded logic which is error prone and requires a lot of testing, so we need your feedback more than ever as they are both incompletely tested. There is sadly only one known demo for Kingdom. Support for the Windows and Mac versions of Kingdom may come later! Please contact us if you have some other demos of both games.
To play any of these games, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker and please take some screenshots along the way!
