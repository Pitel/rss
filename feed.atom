        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While Intel Arc Graphics continue enjoying performance optimizations with the open-source Linux graphics driver stack, the major limitation facing Arc Graphics on Linux right now for gamers is the lack of sparse residency support that is needed for running many newer games on Linux with Intel graphics -- particularly newer Windows D3D12 titles running on Linux via Valve's Steam Play. It's been a long known limitation and will hopefully be addressed once the Intel Xe kernel driver is introduced, but at least as an interim solution there is now "fake" sparse support being implemented...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I think back on most of the cinematic platformers I've played recently, it's not the latter part of their genre title I remember most, but the former. The lush camera pans of your Planet Of Lanas, the haunting backdrops of your Somervilles and the gooey, malleable monstrosities of your Insides. These dramatic moments linger in the memory much longer than their respective running and jumping, and if it's a proper platforming challenge I'm after, I usually look elsewhere, swapping cinema for action with your Raymans, Trines and Oris. 
Full Void, on the other hand, is a cinematic run and jumper that manages to strike a good balance between both parts of its personality. Following in the Another World school of gorgeous pixel art meets one-foot-wrong-and-you're-dead-style platforming (albeit with much more generous checkpointing than its 1991 source material), there's a real athleticism in your teen hero's journey to bring down a despotic AI, making its intricate leaps and bounds just as memorable as its down-to-the-wire set pieces.

The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom has been an absolutely massive release for Nintendo and months later it's still enjoying success in the sales charts.
We've seen it dominating Switch sales in Japan for some time now thanks to Famitsu data, and on the Switch eShop in the same region, it's also been just as popular. In an update, Nintendo has revealed the most downloaded Switch games in Japan for the first half of 2023 and Tears of the Kingdom is unsurprisingly in the top spot. Games like Pikmin 2 made the cut as well.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Ryzen 5 7600X processor might be one of AMD's cheapest options in their Zen 4 lineup, but this chip is still hugely powerful compared to prior Ryzen generations. It takes advantage of its 5nm process and the AM5 socket to hit higher clock speeds, has architectural improvements that raise its single-core prowess, and of course has access to DDR5 memory and PCIe 5.0 add-in cards too. That's made it a strong option for gaming, but a high asking price of $300 at launch - plus expensive motherboards and DDR5 - put it out of reach of most sane budget builds. That's slowly changing as these chips and other components become cheaper, and today the 7600X has hit a new low price in the US: just $200 at Amazon.com, a full $100 off its MSRP and a great deal for a processor with this kind of performance.

I have an affectionate fascination with video games that look fictitious. Whenever a TV show, movie, or even cartoon wants to depict a legally distinct video game for their characters to play, they always show something that looks familiar but is entirely wrong. It’s like the uncanny valley of video games.
It shows a charming unfamiliarity with the medium. However, when it happens in an actual game, you realize that couldn’t be possible. Someone who has to be familiar with other games made this. Looking like an accident was, in fact, an accident.
1990’s Pit-Fighter has an excuse. It was one of the first attempts at using digital images of actors in a video game, a technique that would be made popular by 1992’s Mortal Kombat. There is also an excuse for it being about as much…]]></summary>

Though we don't know exactly what triggered the removal, many players complained about the mode's high instability. Very sad news, considering how VSH seemed to work just fine while in its community mode version. Things have gotten even rockier four days after the update. A few players claim VSH is back up, whereas others complain that the mode is constantly showing up only to vanish again. Either way, many complain they're unable to enter matches.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nowhere to go but up
Ternox has released their ‘80s immersed finance sim, Stonks-9800, today on Early Access.
You’ll probably need a deep breath after groaning and/or sighing at that meme-inspired name. After your lungs reinflate, take a look, because Stonks-9800 is a pretty neat-looking concept.
Economic sims aren’t necessarily a new thing, with the earliest titles dating back to the days of mainframe computers. However, we’ve recently been receiving some interesting new twists, like Space Warlord Organ Trading Simulator. Stonks-9800 takes the concept back to Japan’s economic bubble of the 1980s. It’s presented sort of as a menu-driven interactive fiction game where you buy and sell things like real estate and cars. The goal of the game is to improve your own standard of living while also not dying of overwork.
[caption id="attachment_392114" align="alignnone" width="640"] Image via Ternox[/caption]
Ternox suggests that the game is going for a chill vibe, and while talk of finances tends to trigger my anxiety, I can see what they mean. If nothing else, you can unwind and play Pachinko or bet on horse races.
I think it looks pretty great. I assume the latter half of the name, Stonks-9800, is a reference to the NEC PC-9800, which was a ubiquitous computer throughout the 1980s in Japan. However, I could do without the meme interest. How about “Super Zaibatsu 9800” or “The Death and Return of Wallstreet Kid.” Maybe I’m the uncool one here.
Stonks-9800 is available right now via Steam Early Access. The full release should launch in 2024 and will appear on PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Switch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The great GTA 6 leak of 2022
Back in September 2022, Rockstar confirmed there'd been a leak in which a ton of early GTA 6 footage had been made public, showing everyone the early look at one of the most anticipated games in years. An alleged perpetrator was eventually caught. However, the hacker accused of the leak may not be standing trial.
In a report from Reuters, Arion Kurtaj—the 18-year-old who is believed to have hacked a number of big companies—has been declared "not fit to stand trial," after being assessed by psychiatrists. The report goes on to say that the jury will determine whether he committed the acts alleged, rather than determine whether he is guilty or not guilty.
Alongside the GTA 6 leak, Kurtaj has been accused of 12 offenses. He's also been accused, along with an unnamed 17-year-old, of blackmailing BT, one of the UK's biggest internet providers. The 17-year-old will be standing trial on two counts of blackmail, two counts of fraud, and three charges under the UK's Computer Misuse Act.
Rockstar needed to plug this leak
When the news that GTA 6 footage had been leaked, Rockstar issued a message on social media. The post said that the company had "suffered a network intrusion," at the hands of an "unauthorized third party", which "illegally accessed and downloaded confidential information from our systems."
Many immediately had access to plenty of footage from an early development build of Grand Theft Auto 6. As huge as the leak was for both Rockstar and parent company Take-Two Interactive, it didn't deter the studio, which is still working on the anticipated GTA 5 follow-up. The accused hacker was arrested not long after the leak, but pleaded not guilty at the time.

User wwm0nkey on Resetera has revealed that thanks to a push from fans, Microsoft has revived the matchmaking service on the 2007 Shadowrun shooter on PC and Xbox 360.
The Shadowrun tabletop RPG has seen its share of video game representation over the years, but it hasn’t all been good. The 2007 multi-player shooter is seen as the biggest flop. This is mainly because it has very little to do with the tabletop game and was widely written off before it even hit the market. It didn’t help the PC version that this was when Microsoft was trying to push people to the maligned Windows Vista, and they locked it to that version of the OS and left anyone unwilling to upgrade out in the cold.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A bit of a blunder, it seems
When it released in 2020, reviews for The Last of Us: Part 2 were favorable, with particular high praise for its bold storytelling. However, if there's one major criticism, it's that Naughty Dog's lauded series has been exclusive to the PlayStation.
True that the remake of the first game, The Last of Us: Part 1, did come to PC earlier this year, but its glaring issues were a sight for sore eyes. But something may be happening with the sequel, and the cat may have been let out of the proverbial bag by the game's composer.
In a recent interview with the YouTube channel BLENDER, Gustavo Santaolalla, who did the music for both TLoU entries, may have accidentally let slip that a new version of The Last of Us: Part 2 is on the horizon. During one section, one of the hosts expresses their delight that the composer makes a cameo in Part 2.
Santaolalla then says, perhaps without thinking, that in the "new editions," via ResetEra, players will be able to interact with his character. More specifically, they can make him play some specific music. That section of the interview takes place around the 1:36:20 mark.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hb34hYjJ-Wk&t=5779s
Wait, what?
Immediately after this, Santaolalla then says that he can't tell the interviewers anything. It sounds like some information about a new version of The Last of Us: Part 2 may have been accidentally leaked by someone who worked on the game.
What this could mean is anyone's guess. Obviously, we can't say for certain what, if anything, he was referring to. Though it's hard to see it as anything other than something maybe being on the horizon for Part 2.
It's unlikely to be a remaster seeing as the game is only three years old, so a PC port or director's cut could be a possibility. That's just speculation, though. Nothing official has been said at the time of writing.

The ratings for Survivor today might not be anything like what they were back in the early 2000s, but that hasn't stopped publisher Microids from getting in on Survivor: Castaway Island — a game based on the once-popular TV show that will be coming to Switch on 3rd October.
Developed by Magic Pockets, Castaway Survivor takes on the same format as the show. You will play as one of 12 contestants, competing in a series of wilderness challenges and befriending campmates to maintain popularity and avoid being voted off. We haven't seen all that much of the game itself so far, but we're imagining that it will consist of a series of minigame-style challenges interjected by some text-based social drama.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft have announced that a new Game Pass tier will replace Xbox Live Gold on consoles. The new Xbox Game Pass Core tier will cost £7/$10 for a monthly subscription and £50/$60 for an annual one. Microsoft haven’t announced plans to bring Game Pass Core to PC players, although the new tier costs almost the same amount as the (frankly much better value) PC Game Pass variant - for now, at least.


Starting on September 14th, Xbox Live Gold subscribers will be automatically converted to Game Pass Core, which allows access to online multiplayer, exclusive discounts, and a compact collection of games. Xbox’s monthly freebie program Games With Gold is also getting axed, although you can still play previously redeemed games as long as you’re subscribed to either the Core or Ultimate tiers.

The PS5 Access Controller has finally gotten a release date. The circular controller launches on December 6, 2023. Pre-orders will become available for the controller starting on July 21.
[caption id="attachment_391877" align="alignnone" width="640"] Image by Sony[/caption]
PS5's New Access Controller to Launch on December 6
The controller is going for a price of $89.99 and features 8 onboard buttons for its disc-shaped design. The control stick, which can be replaced with a joystick design, sits on the side. The controller allows for up to 30 control profiles, as well as toggleable commands. The controller also supports four 3.5mm expansion ports that allow for external devices to issue commands as well.
The Access controller is also able to adjust its control stick length, as well as including attachments for an AMPS Pattern mount. The Access controller can also be used in conjunction with the DualSense, to allow for more customization options. Up to two access controllers can be used in conjunction with a single DualSense.

Each cap on the controller can also be switched out, changing their form factor, and the icon on the cap. This allows for buttons to match the on-screen display without a need for marking the device or purchasing third-party replacements. Each cap has multiple textures as well, as described on the controller's page.
This is a massive jump in accessibility for PlayStation. Combining this with the accessibility options in their first-party titles, Sony opens the door for more players to experience games on its platforms. Xbox has a similar device in its adaptive controller, which has received awards for its design. These tools make it easier for everyone to engage with games, removing barriers and making this hobby more accessible in the process.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[They originally debuted in 2014
Remember the 3DS/Wii U era? It was a weird time, right? Tons of original games were being released left and right, and although the 3DS was helping Nintendo stay relevant, the Wii U sadly never caught on. Throughout that time the company tried all sorts of experiments, including selling three Pikmin shorts in a bundle for $4.99 on both of the aforementioned platforms. While those eShops went kaput a while back, Nintendo didn't just pull a tax writeoff and chuck them into the ether: no, they put them up on YouTube for free. In anticipation of Pikmin 4, you can watch them now!
If you're curious, one of the reasons these shorts caught on worldwide is the Mr. Bean/Shaun the Sheep effect. They contain no spoken words, so anyone can enjoy them. They also tie into the first two games nicely, without requiring any prior knowledge of the series to "get." In other words, they're perfectly crafted for Pikmin newcomers and veterans alike. Based on stats from multiple Nintendo-based YouTube channels, "Occupational Hazards" is far and away the most popular one if you want to start there.
You can catch all three of them below: no 3DS/Wii U required!

The new service will provide access to more than 25 games, intended to replace the old Games with Gold. Microsoft intends to add new games two to three times per year.

All Xbox 360 titles redeemed through Games with Gold will remain in your library even if you do not subscribe to Game Pass.

Xbox Live changed the industry more than two decades ago with its multiplayer network features, but the program’s premier Xbox Live Gold has waned in popularity for the past few years, likely due to a lack of compelling free games to download. Now, Xbox is ending Xbox Live Gold on September 14 and replacing it with Xbox Game Pass Core. This new subscription tier of Xbox Game Pass will cost $9.99 per month, or $59.99 a year, and serves as an evolution of Xbox Live Gold, according to the company.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Those pesky NDAs
Starfield is not exactly a complete mystery. Over the years, we've learned a lot about it. There's pretty much been enough information about Bethesda's anticipated sci-fi RPG to fill a 1,000-page compendium. However, it turns out that the majority of the people working on the game are not allowed to actually reveal a lot of detail about it.
That's according to a tweet from Emil Pagliarulo, the design director for Starfield. In a couple of recent posts, it's been noted that many fans have been wanting further information about the upcoming release. Unfortunately, Pagliarulo has said that only Todd Howard is "authorized to talk publicly about unreleased game info," adding that it does frustrate him that he's unable to answer a lot of people's questions.
https://twitter.com/Dezinuh/status/1679551395752558592
A third tweet says that, no matter how much he'd like to, Pagliarulo is unable to share anything about Starfield's performance, the content itself, or "well, most things," as per his NDA. There's no mention of whether anyone else at Bethesda has signed non-disclosure agreements, but it's more than likely they will have done in preparation for Starfield.
But it's still not coming to PlayStation
One thing that has been clear throughout the game's development is its exclusivity with Xbox. For those who don't have a powerful enough PC, and/or have a PS5, there's currently no chance in hell you'll get to experience Starfield, despite Microsoft saying it could easily shift millions of units on the rival console.
In any case, it hasn't stopped it from being the hype juggernaut that it currently is. No one can really blame Todd Howard for wanting the final say in what gets mentioned about Starfield, but it's also understandable why those directly working on the game would be frustrated they can't answer fan questions about it.

Last week, the FTC lost its case against Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard and its subsequent appeal. This effectively paves the way for Microsoft to complete its purchase of the Call of Duty maker, save for its ongoing wrinkle with the Competition and Markets Authority, the regulatory agency in the U.K.  Now, Microsoft has announced that it and Sony have signed a binding agreement to keep Activision Blizzard’s flagship franchise, Call of Duty, on the PlayStation platform for 10 years.

Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer revealed on Twitter that Microsoft and PlayStation have signed a binding agreement to keep Call of Duty on PlayStation platforms. The agreement will take effect following the acquisition of Activision Blizzard which could happen at any time following recent court rulings.
"We look forward to a future where players globally have more choice to play their favorite games," Spencer tweeted.
No further details on the agreement have been released, so we're not sure if this is similar to the decade-long deal between Microsoft and Nintendo earlier this year.
Microsoft President Brad Smith also chimed in about the new agreement. "From Day One of this acquisition, we’ve been committed to addressing the concerns …]]></summary>

It looks like we are about to see a shift in the design of future handheld gaming consoles. A newly-passed European Union regulation has stated that an appliance's portable battery will need to be "readily removable and replaceable by the end-user" by 2027, something that is not currently offered by devices like the Switch.
This was laid out as one of several practices aimed at improving sustainability rules around a battery's production, use and disposal (thanks, Overkill). The 366-page document goes into detail about what these requirements will involve, noting that a battery will only be considered "readily removable" when it can be replaced by the end user without requiring any specialist tools:

The U.S. Appeals Court for the Ninth Circuit has denied the Federal Trade Commission's appeal of a recent ruling in the regulator's case against Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard. 
Last week, California Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley denied the FTC's request for a preliminary injunction in its case to block Microsoft and Xbox from acquiring the Call of Duty maker. The FTC sought this preliminary injunction to have the court order the tech giant to cease its attempt at acquiring Activision Blizzard for a colossal $69 billion. Following the court ruling, the FTC had until July 14 to file an appeal and it did so on July 12. Judge Corley quickly denied this appeal, as expected, and now, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has also denied it, in a massiv…]]></summary>

Turning beloved children’s characters into horror monsters isn’t something new. I think “nightmarish Alice in Wonderland” has been done roughly a bajillion times. So, My Friendly Neighborhood’s idea of murderous Sesame Street puppets may not seem that novel. Except that’s not what it’s about. I know. It kind of took me by surprise.
I’d also say it’s “My First Resident Evil,” and the argument could be made, but that’s selling the game short. My Friendly Neighborhood wears its inspirations, sure, but it’s more than just a horror game made friendly for a younger audience. Its themes of non-violence, its goofy characters, and its approach to horror all convey much more depth than you — or certainly I — might’ve expected.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In Viewfinder, you solve puzzles by figuring out the right way of looking at things, and you do that here by both physically moving around its abstract 3D spaces, and by mentally wrapping your brain around its mind-bending rule set. Perspective is key because here's the thing: this is a world where you can bring photos to life, the 2D image becoming a 3D reality when you place it within the puzzle world.
It's an incredible hook and one which I've never seen in a puzzle game before. There are echoes of The Witness, Gorogoa, and Superliminal here, but Viewfinder's dizzyingly mind-melting puzzles are still very much its own. It impresses from the get-go and continues to pull tricks out of its silky tophat right until the end of its four hour run time. It's compact, brilliant, and one of the best puzzle games of 2023.

Viewfinder is all about playing with your perception and giving you the tools to do so yourself. It belongs to the difficult-to-define sub-genre of video games popularized by Portal, where you have access to a mind-blowing ability in order to solve puzzles. The danger with giving the player these kinds of god tools to get them to their destination is sometimes the well of creativity can run dry by the end, or it all just gets so complicated that the fun disappears. Viewfinder thankfully falls into neither of these traps, presenting a series of engaging puzzles that frequentl…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Adibou, the first game in the beloved children's series, is now ready for public testing!
Also known as Adi Jr.'s World of Discoveries, this 1991 Coktel Vision title began the educational Adibou collection aimed at children of age 4 to 7 years.
Many of the iconic activities and mechanisms of the series were already part of this first opus: planting flowers, playing the game Breakout, and being rewarded with sweets upon completing Read/Count exercises. And of course, this was Adibou's first appearance! Although the floppy release has him speak the same strange gibberish as heard in the Goblins series, he is still the patient and funny learning partner that he's remembered for being in later games.
ScummVM supports all of the game's releases, from the initial 16-color floppy ones to later 1994 CD versions with richer graphics and sound effects. So dig out your dusty Adibou disks, get a ScummVM daily development build, and start collecting sweets while completing math and reading exercises! Please also contact us if you own a version ScummVM is not yet aware of, and report to the issue tracker any problem you may encounter.
As much as ScummVM aims to replicate the original gaming experience, there is one feature we are unfortunately unable to support. When hardworking children complete their virtual sweets collection, a message invites them to mail a floppy disk with their savegame to Coktel Vision, who would send them a parcel containing Coktel goodies and actual sweets! So if you are introducing children to Adibou through ScummVM, be prepared to go to the nearest shop and buy some candy for when they finish the game!

But making this power/performance feature controversial is that it requires authentication with the AMD Platform Security Processor (PSP) for activation with user-space blobs for tapping this greater control of the hardware.

Hi folks, welcome back to another edition of Box Art Brawl!
Last week, we took a look at the wonderful Mario & Luigi: Super Star Saga + Bowser's Minions for the Nintendo 3DS.

The indie hit Neon White earned itself a cult following after it launched in 2022. The developer, Angel Matrix, recently announced that the game will be receiving a physical release soon. Depending on what version you buy, you can also expect a few extras.

What you get with Neon White's physical edition
The physical editions for the PS5 and Nintendo Switch launch on September 12 this year. If you grab it at retail stores, you'll receive a bonus 11 by 17 inches poster by Rebecca Ryan. It launches with a $39.99 price tag.
Pre-orders for exclusive iam8bit versions are available for preorder. Both the Switch and PS5 versions include a physical copy of the game along with five anime-style "character peeker" stickers, music by Machine Girl, and a cover sheet by Rebecca Ryan. Both versions of the iam8bit exclusive cost $44.99, and they will be available in this year's fourth quarter.

Xbox players shouldn't despair, as it appears a port is on the way. Eagle-eyed fans have spotted an ESRB rating for Neon White that includes the Xbox Series X/S, suggesting that developers haven't forgotten about the platform.
For gamers looking for a unique FPS, Neon White is a critically acclaimed title worth checking out. This physical release comes at a time when studios are opting to not include physical versions of titles. This is the case with Remedy Entertainment which currently has no plans to release physical editions of Alan Wake 2.

When Limited Run Games announced that Gex would return to modern gaming platforms, I decided to revisit the lizard’s debut adventure. I had no idea what I was getting into.
For the uninitiated, Gex is a mascot platformer released by Crystal Dynamics in 1995. It was originally developed for the 3DO console, a wildly expensive piece of hardware that, adjusted for inflation, cost around half a month’s rent in New York City. Naturally, this is how I first played Gex. Being in elementary school at the time, the only 3DO games that really appealed to me were Gex and Soccer Kid. All I remember about Soccer Kid is that there’s an enemy that says “get awf my laaaaaand,” which I found funny.
Meanwhile, I always internalized Gex as an underrated plat…]]></summary>

Capcom's new team-based competitive shooter Exoprimal is out, and well, it's a bit of an oddball. It's got guns, mechs, and it's all about whittling down the dino horde. And while it's still early on in this game's lifespan, we have a few tips for making life in Exoprimal easier.
Keep in mind, Exoprimal is a relatively full price ($59.99)  game, with additional progression and add-ons for extra cash. I don't personally recommend dumping that kind of cash unless you just want to fast-track through the suits. Some of the early suits you get will tide you over well to the later ones, and most of Exoprimal is about efficiency in PvE, though you will have to fight a player from time to time. (It's worth noting that Exoprimal is on Game Pass too, which makes a d…]]></summary>

My household had an N64 for the late ‘90s, so all of my PS1 experience was had on a close friend’s console. However, they weren’t as focused on video games as I was in my youth, so I mostly just got to play the really big titles. Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater, Twisted Metal, and whatever could be found on demo discs.
I’ve been making up for lost time, recently. My PS1 collection has been growing, and I’ve been paying close attention to the titles that slipped between the cracks. 1998’s Brave Fencer Musashi is one such title. It was made during what was probably Squaresoft’s most inventive period. Between all the Final Fantasy’s, we got Parasite Eve and Vagrant Story.

Exoprimal seemed to drift on and off my radar leading up to its launch. It was the game that would show up on a stream, I'd gleefully take in all the cheesiness of a mech-powered dino-horde defense shooter, and move on. Even after playing the beta, Exoprimal didn't leave too much of a lasting impression.
So maybe that's why, as I spend today playing the launch version of Exoprimal, I'm a bit surprised by how much I'm enjoying the experience. It's not taking my breath away, but it's not boring either. Exoprimal is pretty okay. And yes, part of that is because it's a game about piloting a mech suit against a horde of otherworldly dinosaurs. It's fun for a squad, but it's got an asterisk or two on it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dell make some cracking monitors, from titanic OLED ultrawides to more pedestrian models suitable for office work and slower-paced gaming. We normally focus on the upper end of the spectrum, but today we're featuring an entry-level 27-inch 1440p model that's able to deliver excellent image quality, wide viewing angles, a higher-than-normal 75Hz refresh rate and  superior ergonomics thanks to a nice stand. All that for £175 - not bad, right? 
To get this price, you'll need to sign up for Dell's newsletter to get a 5% off code, then use it with another code - TELEGRAPH5MON - at the checkout. That brings this £259 monitor down to £175, complete with a three-year warranty and free delivery.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fun as it is to pose as an expert on everything, I am not the best judge when it comes to the old psychojalimical horror. Which may be why I don't quite know how I feel about Decarnation.
There's a big content warning needed here for sexual assault, something that I assumed would turn out to be the whole point of the game. An unfair judgement, it turns out, as one of its strengths is the intriguing mystery of what's actually going on, not the more common "what traumatic thing is everything a metaphor for".
Protagonist Gloria has a lot going on, see. She's a talented cabaret dancer who recently modelled for a statue, for an artist who immediately makes some creepy remarks about how she's an ugly old hag at 29. Misogyny and self image are at the heart of this, but they're wrapped up in Gloria's worries about getting older, chasing intimacy with a new lover, and her deep love for dance, an art form that games so rarely do much with. It's not an ugly or blunt game, despite its distressing themes, and I think that's why it works for me overall.

In this case, the Emmys, where it’s up for no less than two dozen awards.

I am so, so pumped to head back into the world of the Helion System developer Jump Over The Age has created here, even if it's going to be a good long while before we get to do that yet. Indeed, when I spoke to them ahead of the game's reveal at this year's PC Gaming Show, creator Gareth Damian Martin said it probably wouldn't be until at least next year before we start seeing it in action.   
The good news is, while we wait for Starward Vector to come into orbit, Damian Martin is putting out a free monthly newsletter to help fill that Citizen Sleeper-shaped hole in our lives. Entitled The Helion Dispatches, the second episode just came out this week, and I've been enjoying it immensely.

Join us today on Twitch at 10:00 a.m. Central as we kick of the adventure, which will continue each week until we roll credits. We'll also have every episode available the next day on our Game Informer Shows YouTube Channel (or you can watch the videos in the above playlist). 
Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts was released for the Xbox 360 on November 11, 2008. The third (and, so far, final) entry in Rare's beloved platforming series centers on vehicle creation, where players collect and slap together hundreds of parts to assemble their own wacky contraptions to explore. The bevy of possible combinations and emphasis on player choice and creativity was largely unprecedented at the time, paving the way for future games such as the upcoming The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. However, this direction would divide fans due to how much it strays from the traditional Banjo formula. So where will I land on it? Let's find out.
Join me, Marcus Stewart, alongside Kyle Hilliard as we explore one of the Xbox 360's biggest hidden gems to see whether it holds up or falls apart like a poorly constructed doohickey.

Nintendo is pushing Pikmin 4 hard before its July 21 release, and you love to see it. Like several of the publisher's older franchises, I'm always willing to let Pikmin have its time in the sun, and now you can literally do that with a set of Pikmin vases.
Revealed by the My Nintendo Store UK Twitter account, a trio of Pikmin vases will release on September 15, 2023, as a "My Nintendo Store exclusive." Nintendo once again decided to go with the classic three Pikmin: red, yellow, and blue. According to the listing, the size of each ceramic vase is roughly 13cm x 5.6cm, and clock in at £17.99 each, or £53.99 for all three. That translates to roughly 70 USD. That's quite a bit, but Nintendo has never shied away from costly merch.
https://twitter.com/NintendoStoreUK/status/1679464884512202752
You can find them for pre-order here, along with a few other pieces of Pikmin merch. If I had to get just one, I'd go with the blue Pikmin. The open-mouth look is just so striking and strange: it'll be a conversation piece!
[caption id="attachment_391734" align="alignnone" width="640"] Image via PlayAsia[/caption]
If you're looking for more Pikmin 4 merch, there is some out there
PlayAsia has a set of Pikmin terrariums up for pre-order now for $51.99 (USD). It's a set of six and features various events and activities from the series. Note that the pre-order deadline for the terrariums on PlayAsia is July 24, and they are available at other places like Amazon.jp, but some outlets do not ship overseas.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stray Gods: The Role-Playing Musical has been delayed by one week. 
Initially due out on August 3, the musical RPG will now hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on August 10. As for why, publisher Humble Games and developer Summerfall Studios says it is taking the extra week to work on performance parity across all platforms and to allow players the space to play Larian Studios’ upcoming RPG, Baldur’s Gate 3. 


Here’s what Humble Games and Summerfall Studios have to say about the Stray Gods delay: 
For the uninitiated, Stray Gods is a hand-illustrated role-playing musical where players will decide lines in songs, similar to picking dialogue choices in an RPG. The music is composed by Grammy-nominated composer Austin Wintory (Journey, The Pathless, Assassin’s Creed Syndicate), Tripod, and Montaigne. 
These songs are performed by a cast filled with names you might recognize, too, like Troy Baker, Ashley Johnson, Rahul Kohli, Janina Gavankar, Felicia Day, and more. Laura Bailey voices the lead, Grace, a college dropout in the game’s modern fantasy world granted the power of a Muse. This power is what Grace uses to “find out the truth behind her predecessor’s death before time runs out,” according to a press release.
Stray Gods: The Role-Playing Musical hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on August 10, 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Though Game Pass may pick up the slack
Both Starfield and MachineGames' Indiana Jones are going to be exclusives for the Xbox. As such, not only will a lot of PlayStation owners be pissed off they won't get to play either of these games, but some may question whether Microsoft has considered that this move will likely mean less sales.
However, the Xbox company has anticipated this, it seems. Screenshots from court documents used in the Microsoft vs. FTC case (as uploaded by games journalist Stephen Totilo) reveal that Tim Stuart, chief financial officer for the tech giant, believes exclusivity won't be a problem.
https://twitter.com/stephentotilo/status/1679307950706372611
In fact, Microsoft is confident both Starfield and Indiana Jones would sell "more than 10 million units" if they were going to be released on PlayStation. Testifying in court, Stuart said that the company had "evaluated exclusivity of ZeniMax [parent company of Bethesda] games in December 2020".
Ten million is a huge potential loss
Having said that, Microsoft is certain it can offset such a potential loss through Game Pass. By making Starfield and Indiana Jones available on the Xbox cloud service, the company hopes to make up for not selling 10 million units via its biggest competitor.
In the grand scheme of things, it doesn't seem like Stuart or Microsoft are concerned about not being able to shift millions more on the PlayStation. Given the immense hype surrounding Bethesda's upcoming sci-fi RPG, there's no question about it being able to make a significant profit.
Starfield is due for release on September 6 for Xbox Series X|S and PC. If you want something to do until then, may we suggest this 1,000-page compendium?

I think Natsume is pretty confident in Harvest Moon: The Winds of Anthos. After announcing the game was on its way last year with no video or artwork beyond a logo reveal, it started to ramp up interest in the upcoming title with screenshot releases on its social media channels. Coming off of Harvest Moon: One World, it didn't too bad. In fact, it looked like it could be the best Harvest Moon game since Bokujō Monogatari dipped. With the release of the first trailer, that's still a definite possibility (even if it is a mighty low bar to clear).
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUSvjMFkfhA
Right now, the farming sim genre is as competitive as it's ever been. Stardew Valley remains the stalwart favorite of the category, but that hasn't stopped a trove of indie and established developers from their hats into the ring. Story of Seasons: A Wonderful Life just dropped, and in the months ahead, we'll see titles like Fae Farm, The Ranchers, and Pixelshire. Despite the issues the series has had over the past decade, I think the Harvest Moon name still carries some weight in the industry, and with this trailer looking as good as it does, I wouldn't be surprised to see more people opting to give the Natsume series a shot this time around. This may end up as another misfire along the lines of Harvest Moon: One World, but I'm choosing to have a positive outlook on life.
Harvest Moon: The Winds of Anthos will launch for Nintendo Switch, PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S on September 26, 2023. One thing to make note of if you're looking to get this on Switch is everything in the trailer was captured on a PS5. Just something to keep in mind.

Recently, it was announced that Twitch would be improving its revenue splits through what's being called the Partner Plus program. This means streamers will be entitled to a 70/30 split instead of the current 50/50, providing they meet certain requirements.
However, while it's generally been accepted that this is a step in the right direction, more than a few content creators are concerned about the upcoming program. Speaking to Eurogamer recently, a number of streamers say they feel the scheme is "anti-community," with concerns that a lot of people who regularly use Twitch to stream will struggle to qualify.

In April, the CMA blocked this acquisition over cloud gaming concerns, making Microsoft’s fight for the green light in this acquisition more challenging. But it shifted its sights on the Federal Trade Commission in the U.S. afterward, with plans to appeal the CMA’s ruling in the meantime. 


Earlier this week, California Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley denied the FTC’s request for a preliminary injunction in its case to block Microsoft and Xbox from acquiring Activision Blizzard.

Luck Be A Landlord is about meeting ever escalating rent demands by playing a slot machine. Each month gives you a limited number of spins to come up with the money, and the chance to add one of three random symbols after each spin. Those symbols bounce off each other in zany but logical ways: bees pollinate flowers, comedians amplify monkeys. Dogs befriend humans. Billionaires get guillotined.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Making 'ample space' for the gods
The summer is becoming increasingly packed for games, especially as dates start to shift around. With Baldur's Gate 3 moving its release date up, it put Larian's RPG in direct contention with another RPG, Stray Gods.
Now, Summerfall Studios is taking the opportunity for a slight delay. Originally scheduled for August 3, Summerfall is pushing the launch of its musical RPG to August 10. And in a statement on the matter, the studio was pretty straightforward about why:
"We want everyone to have ample space to check out Stray Gods when it launches," said the studio. "Baldur's Gate 3 is hotly anticipated (by us, too!) and we want to give our fans room to celebrate Stray Gods."
The extra time may prove a boon, though. As the statement goes on to say, Summerfall is taking on a lot by launching on a plethora of platforms—PC, Xbox, PlayStation, and the Nintendo Switch.
"This is a huge undertaking for any team, let alone an indie shipping its first title," said Summerfall. "This extra week allows us to have performance parity as close as possible—across every platform."

The song remains the same
I admire the candor, as well as the hope that players looking forward to both of these games could finish the titanic Baldur's Gate 3 in a week's time. Jokes aside, though, an extra week can be a silver lining for a team to put extra polish on something.
Stray Gods is definitely on my shortlist for the summer. It's a role-playing adventure centered around actual musical performances, with quite a star-studded cast. Having a little extra time to space these games out will be nice, and hopefully give Summerfall whatever extra time it needs to fine-tune all its launches.
Stray Gods arrives on August 10 for PC, PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch.

There’s no real reason why I should love Pikmin as much as I do. On paper, the idea of having a salad army run around picking up rocket parts doesn’t sound too exciting. However, Nintendo hooked me right away back in 2001. My new GameCube was hungry, and I was eager to feed it more.
Nowhere has my enthusiasm for the game been tested quite like with the wait for Pikmin 4. Shigeru Miyamoto first teased us about it back in 2015, and then Nintendo remained coy about it until just recently. Pikmin 4 is finally happening, and it’s happening very soon.
So, while I eagerly sit here, chewing on my fingernails and waiting for it to reach my local game shop, I’m going to take a look back at the series up to this point. Once the new game does reach my big meaty claws, I’ll circle bac…]]></summary>

Larian Studios is nearing a moved-up launch date for its massive RPG Baldur's Gate 3. But while the adventure is arriving sooner than announced, it comes with a caveat that PC owners won't get an extra-extra head start.
Originally, Larian had planned to give a 72-hour head start to everyone who picked up the Digital Deluxe Edition of Baldur's Gate 3. This Early Access would allow a head start on Act 1, the same area already in the current Early Access build, but in the 1.0 version. It would've been a lot of players too, as Larian upgraded everyone who bought the Early Access of Baldur's Gate 3 to the Digital Deluxe Edition.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Super brawling robot
Strap on your robo-boots, Domesticated Ant Games has dropped their retro-inspired platformer, Gravity Circuit, today.
What’s Gravity Circuit? I’m just learning that right now, myself. Past me really dug it since I put it on my wishlist and forgot about it. I can totally see why! It looks like a missing link between the classic Mega Man series and Mega Man X.
You play as metal hero Kai, who is trying to stop the evil doings of the Virus Army. Gravity Circuit barely tries to hide its influences behind a fake mustache. There’s ride armor and upgrade chips. However, there seem to be more combat options, as hand-to-hand plays a big part. It claims to have action “dialed to the max.” Its trailer sure makes it look like that.

The graphics are done in a way that emulates the NES color palette. Obviously, a lot of the effects would be extremely difficult to pull off on the actual 8-bit hardware, but the aesthetic is there.
Mega Man X is my comfort food, and I feel there’s more room in the world for platformers that can nail that same pace and feel. I’m not sure Gravity Circuit can do that, but I’m willing to find out.
You can find out yourself on Switch, PS4, PS5, or PC. Gravity Circuit is available today.

It was due to leave early access with the release of its final chapter on July 18th, but its lead developer has chosen to delay it instead. He has a pretty good reason: his development time had "been slowly sucked away as I've been coming to grips with fatherhood."

The big pitch this year from EA Sports is around its advanced technology. EA's proprietary Frostbite engine returns, but with enhancements, including the new Sapien character model skeletons first introduced through our Madden NFL 24 coverage last month. The skeleton ensures that players look more true to life when standing still but also in motion, making for more realistic movement that affects both the game's visuals and gameplay.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Clock Tower series is a favorite among horror game aficionados, but the first game has never been released outside of Japan. That finally changes as the 1995 classic is getting spruced up for a modern, international re-release.
For any Americans thinking, “But we got the first Clock Tower on PlayStation,” we actually didn’t. The 1997 game known as “Clock Tower,” which did release in the West, was really Clock Tower 2 and was titled as such in Japan (watch us play it in this classic episode of Replay).
The actual first game arrived on Super Famicom (SNES) and stars Jennifer Simpson, an orphan adopted by the Barrows family only to find that a murderous stalker called the Scissorman is terrorizing their mansion. As a point-and-click adventure, you use a mouse cursor to guide Jennifer and interact with your surroundings to solve puzzles and find clues while evading the Scissorman. The game also features multiple endings. Clock Tower is considered one of the forefathers of survival horror and has been ported to different platforms, such as PC and the Wii/Wii U eShops, several times in Japan. 


Wayforward is handling this port, which is being made using Limited Run Games’ Carbon Engine. As discussed in the developer diary video above, improvements include the game's first official English localization (along with multiple language options), a new animated intro, motion-comic cutscenes, and a new vocalized theme song by famed anime and Silent Hill singer Mary McGlynn. It also includes an art gallery, save states, and other modern tweaks. 
Clock Tower is coming early next year for PlayStation and Xbox consoles, Switch, and PC. Limited Run Games is also releasing premium physical versions of the game.]]></summary>

The survival genre is one that’s never entirely worked for me. Life is already stressful enough, and playing a game built on the idea of stress, resource management, and, well, survival has never appealed to me in my off-hours. But Keen Games, the studio behind Portal Knights, let me watch roughly an hour of gameplay of its new survival game Enshrouded behind closed doors, and I came away excited about everything it’s doing to alleviate the stresses of the genre. 
Keen Games describes Enshrouded as an open-world survival action RPG set in a post-apocalyptic fantasy world drowned by a mysterious fog. You play as a unique person brought back to life by a powerful force called The Flame. From there…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Join Wesley LeBlanc, Marcus Stewart, and Kyle Hilliard as we discuss Ra Ra Boom, an upcoming beat 'em up headed to PC this year. Wesley played through the demo multiple times, using each character to take down AI and robots alike. He, Marcus, and Kyle discuss the game's visual style, use of lanes in combat, fully-voiced characters, and more. 
Enjoy roughly 12 minutes of all new Ra Ra Boom gameplay in the latest NGT below: 


In 2008, Chris Bergman, who later co-founded Gylee Games and now works as its CEO, bought the domain to raraboom.com. Today, that site takes you to the Steam page for Ra Ra Boom, the beat 'em up featured in our latest installment of New Gameplay Today. Gylee Games started work on the game back in 2019, before the resurgence of beat 'em up games, but Bergman is stoked about said resurgence. He calls it a "rising tides raise all ships" scenario. 
After playing through this demo multiple times, I'm excited for Ra Ra Boom's full release. Its inclusion of lanes has fixed my largest problem with beat 'em ups: my inability to properly target and hit enemies. Add in the fully voiced characters, beautiful art style, fun cast of ninja cheerleaders, and an emphasis on story that's somewhat rare in the genre, and I'm ready to smash some robots. 
Ra Ra Boom hits PC this fall.

The game stars Antea Duarte and Red mac Raith, two lovers who serve as Banishers, those who protect the living from the lingering spirits of the dead. Unfortunately, Antea has become a ghost herself and must work alongside Red to find a way to bring herself back to life. Along the way, they’ll explore New Eden, a North American settlement teeming with supernatural dangers, and player combat threats using Red’s conventional weaponry and Antea’s spectral abilities. Players will also interact with New Eden’s residents in choice-driven conversations that steer the course of the narrative, namely in deciding whether to fulfill their duty as a Banisher or sacrifice that oath to restore Antea’s mortality.  


Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. It's the second of three games on Don't Nod's 2023 launch schedule, having released Harmony: The Fall of Reverie last month and it has a meditative climbing game called Jusant slated for this fall.]]></summary>

The game seems to be a marriage between everything the studio’s done previously, from their choice-based drama of Life Is Strange to the action-RPG parts they played with in Vampyr. And the result looks great.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm definitely going to keep playing Jagged Alliance 3. However much I waver back and forth on my exact feelings about it, this is crucial. As with its ancestors, you're invading a fictional country with a team of dysfunctional freelance mercenaries, managing their equipment and clashing personalities through a guerrilla war on an open world map whose every sector can host turn-based battles.
It challenges the all-smothering XCOM standard of "two actions per turn" by restoring the ancient way of the Action Point. Everyone has a dozen or so action points per turn to split between movement, shooting, or miscellaneous contextual actions. Chance to hit is never listed, but accuracy can be bumped by spending extra action points. It innovates too by giving everyone a small pool of free movement, keeping battles moving, and broadening the tactical possibilities. It borrows as much from modern designs and is mostly better for it.

Announced at last night’s Limited Run Games showcase, the remaster retains the point-and-clicking bones of the original (16-bit art and creepy child monster) while adding some new meat onto the skeleton (translations, animated cutscenes, and an art gallery.)

Like a beautiful and unusual fish that has suddenly risen to the surface, Dave the Diver is an unexpected surprise. Juggling two core systems that work in tandem, it’s a game that excels as both an exploration experience and as a management sim and does so in ways that are intuitive and easy to pick up. However, the real triumph is a focus on novelty at every turn, with a near-constant supply of sudden twists, activities, and ways to engage with the game, resulting in a joyful and approachable adventure that is hard to put down.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Join Wesley LeBlanc, Marcus Stewart, and Kyle Hilliard as we discuss Double Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons, an upcoming sequel in the classic beat 'em up series. Wesley played through one of the stages in the game to get a feel for how classic fighters Billy and Jimmy feel and the three discuss their thoughts on these characters, the visual style, the combat, and more.
Enjoy nearly 10 minutes of new Double Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons gameplay in the latest NGT below: 


Developer Secret Base and publisher Modus Games announced Double Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons earlier this summer with a special trailer that you can watch here. The game is set in New York City after it's been destroyed by nuclear war. Brawlers Billy and Jimmy set out to take back what remains from the violent gangs that have since taken over. However, they won't be doing it alone because the game features a roster of 13 playable fighters, including love interest Marian, newcomer Uncle Matin, and more. 
Secret Base says the beat 'em up features "seamless tag team abilities and a multitude of strategies for devastating combos, defensive, and offensive moves." Players can swap characters on the fly, which you can see in the NGT above, as needed in combat. 
Double Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on July 27. It will feature two-player local co-op at launch. Online co-op is set to arrive later in a post-launch update. 
For more previews and discussions of some of the biggest games of 2023 and beyond, be sure to head over to our YouTube page for NGTs about Mortal Kombat 1, Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective, Eternights, Bramble: The Mountain King, Humanity, Afterimage, Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster Collection, XDefiant, Sea of Stars, and Star Wars Jedi: Survivor.

Sure, tagging is practical, it's helpful, it's kind, but can it really solve problems that wouldn't be solved by slamming a door into someone's face? Of course not. This week, I ask you to pick between risky destruction and precise construction. What's better: breech-loading grenade launchers, or creating construction blueprints?

The build quality, the feel of the mechanical switches, the complete lack of tangible latency… it’s all just lovely. Historically, its high price has been the sole sore spot, but at least it’s joining in Amazon Prime Day with big savings on both the full size and more compact tenkeyless versions.

Like Alice0 wrote when The Banished Vault was first announced seven months ago, the idea of exploring space in "an interstellar gothic monastery" is obviously an instant yes, but I'm also drawn to its neat, grid-like maps of its procedurally generated solar systems, as well as the haunting monochrome portraits of your band of exiled survivors. It looks stunning, and happily the wait for it is almost over, as Tringali and publishers Bithell Games have announced it will be coming to PC on July 25th.

Just yesterday, Microsoft and the CMA released a joint statement to say they’ve paused their legal feud to negotiate, which means Microsoft will need to somewhat restructure the deal and the CMA will then examine it again.

The studio described the development process as an Icarus situation where the team “flew too close to the sun,” and “were unable to accomplish all the goals” that were laid out in the initial Kickstarter plans, leading to these refunds.


Bulkhead announced plans to refund players last year after cancelling the console ports, although all backers are eligible for a refund regardless of pledge tier, platform, or time played. No questions asked. Backers can find information on how to claim refunds via an email from the company.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stray Souls, the upcoming third-person horror game from first-time developer Jukai Studio, will hit PlayStation, Xbox, and PC this fall. 
Jukai Studio and publisher Versus Evil announced this release window in a new trailer that also revealed Silent Hill composer Akira Yamaoka will guest compose on the game’s score. And in that trailer, you can hear a tease of his original track, “Splintered Minds.” 
Check out “Splintered Minds” in the latest Stray Souls trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, Yamaoka’s track sounds great, and Silent Hill fans know this is probably just a taste of some excellent music from the famed composer. The trailer also reveals plenty more Stray Souls gameplay, which features third-person gunplay, some stealth elements, and plenty of terrifying monsters. 
Stray Souls hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC via Steam this fall.

Worldless, which was revealed at last night's ID@Xbox Showcase, is one such Metroidy platformer that's hoping to shake things up with its rhythmic, turn-based battling. I had a sneak peak at its freshly released Steam demo back in March at GDC, and I came away impressed by both its abstract visuals and fluid, dance-like scraps with its angular enemies. The demo is only 30 minutes or so, so why not give it a go for yourself?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I played a timed early demo of Forever Skies last year, my key question about this airborne Subnautica-like was how it would successfully guide its players across its boundless world of ruined, rusting skyscrapers, overgrown plant tendrils and swampy, toxic clouds. As we searched for a rumoured cure that would save what's left of humanity back in the depths of space, would we be ping-ponging from perilous rooftop to perilous turbine pad unaided as we bobbed along the nauseous expanse below? Or would it be a more guided affair, with forgotten text logs and computer terminals nudging us toward tailored waypoints? 
Having now played its recently-released early access version, the answer is a mix of both, with the freedom to scavenge and craft new modules for your burgeoning airship at your leisure while a handy radar points you in the direction of its critical story path. Assuming you've found a busted one to research and 3D print yourself, of course. The tools you need to survive don't come easily in this strangely picturesque wasteland, but they're also not so hard to track down that you ever feel truly threatened by the minutiae of staying alive. It's a pleasant mix for casual survival toe dippers like myself right now, but the dramatic climax of its first major story chunk suggests this is but a brief calm before the eventual storm.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Amazon Prime Day's second day - riles me up that it's technically not a day - of price cuts has served up something rather tantalising for those of us who like to wrap our ears in leatherette and blast the sounds of footsteps into our eardrums. The Logitech G432 wired headset is on sale for a solid £35: that over 50% off the list price, so it's a hefty discount for our top pick of the best PC gaming headsets.
We crowned the Logitech G432 for its sublime audio and brilliant microphone, which combine to make it a superlative all-rounder. Katharine gave it a glittering review, with words like "beautifully crisp" to describe the sound, so you know the patter of gunfire will conjure up sensations similar to, say, taking some sizzling roast potatoes out of the oven.

Besides, this time it’s dropping even deeper than usual, with the Amazon Prime Day 2023 sale sending the G502 Hero down to £29.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I remember playing the first Oxenfree so clearly. The nervousness of not truly understating the supernatural forces its cast of troubled teens was up against, the heightened tension of uncovering the buried secrets of Edwards Island, and - what I loved the most - the finely tuned undercurrent of dread that quietly crept through the game. It conjured a sense of unease in me that I couldn't shake loose, and it was a feeling that clung to me throughout my entire playthrough.
So I was pretty stoked when Night School Studio announced Oxenfree 2: Lost Signals, a direct follow-up set five years after the original game. Lost Signals may take place in a new location with a new cast of characters, but there's still a lot of overlap. There are supernatural spooks, personal character drama, creepy radio equipment, and those good ol' screen glitches that I've missed so much. But with all these tethers to the first game, Lost Signals feels like a re-tread of the same ground. It's still a good sequel, I should add, but it's not a particularly satisfying one.

Oxenfree II: Lost Signals delivers what I have wanted out of a sequel seven years after the first game's release. Although its overarching A-to-C narrative feels like it is missing a “B” in the journey, I’m impressed with most of what Oxenfree II accomplishes. It brings back the original's simple but charming radio mechanics, adds a walkie-talkie that expands the world around protagonist Riley, and, most importantly, features incredibly well-written and believable characters. While Oxenfree II’s paranormal events are spooky an…]]></summary>

For almost 20 years, Nihon Falcom has created one the richest ensembles of original characters, history, and politics in video games with The Legend of Heroes. Across three narrative arcs (and counting), I’ve explored myriad diverse locations, cultures, governments, and organizations, making the continent of Zemuria the most lived-in world I’ve ever experienced in the medium. Trails into Reverie, the latest entry in the long-running franchise, is a bittersweet culmination; I must potentially say goodbye to some of these characters for good after the series succ…]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-07-11T16:38:44.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, a California judge denied the U.S. Federal Trade Commission's request for a preliminary injunction in its case to block Microsoft and Xbox from acquiring Activision Blizzard. Now, shortly after the ruling, Microsoft has announced it will pause its appeal efforts against the Competition and Markets Authority in the U.K. so that it and the CMA can negotiate. 
Back in April, the UK regulatory body blocked Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard over cloud gaming concerns. With a July 18 deadline for the acquisition, Microsoft theoretically needs to either mark the U.K. out of its market as it relates to this purchase or negotiate a deal with the CMA to quell the regulator's concerns. Microsoft was previously set to appear in court to appeal the CMA's block on July 28. According to Microsoft vice chair and president Brad Smith, that won't be happening now as the two parties will instead attempt to negotiate a deal that satisfies both. 
Our statement on the mutual request with the CMA for a pause of our appeal in the UK: pic.twitter.com/8Aky2IJjxS
July 11, 2023
It's important to note that the Competition Appeal Tribunal still needs to either approve or deny this request, as noted by The Verge, but the former seems incredibly likely. In a statement received by The Verge, the CMA said it is "ready to consider any proposals from Microsoft to restructure the transaction in a way that would address the concerns set our in our Final Report," likely alluding to its concerns over cloud gaming (concerns that Microsoft disagrees with). 
Game Informer has reached out to the CMA for a statement regarding Smith's announcement and will update the story if a comment or statement is received.

The legal proceedings led to juicy behind-the-scenes details about revenue shares, blockbuster budgets, and other potential acquisitions. But after listening to five days worth of testimonies, Judge Corley has decided to rule in Microsoft’s favour, allowing the company to close its $70 billion acquisition.

        <updated>2023-07-11T14:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tuatara Games has revealed its next project, and it’s a sci-fi survival shoot ‘em up called Let Them Come: Onslaught. 
Tuatara Games has released games before – it released Bare Butt Boxing this May – but it’s perhaps best known for its work as a AAA VFX support studio working on games like Valorant, Fortnite, Godfall, and more. It’s set to release Let Them Come: Onslaught on PC via Steam Early Access in the first quarter of 2024. Let Them Come: Onslaught puts players behind the gun of a lone survivor on an alien planet who must survive hordes of creatures by activating nukes to blow up the planet. 
Check out the teaser trailer for Let Them Come: Onslaught for yourself below:


Tuatara Games says the game features dynamic weather, and a wide range of weapons, including a flamethrower, laser beam, electric grenade, orbital strikes, and more. As you mow down hordes of aliens, you can upgrade your soldier with increased health, defense, reduced weapon cooldowns, and shields you can activate on the battlefield. To obtain these upgrades, you spend XP you earn on each run.
“We are huge fans of this emerging gameplay experience, and are thrilled to reveal our love letter to the games that inspired us,” Tuatara Games founder Klemen Lozar writes in a press release. “Using our team’s VFX expertise, survivors can expect to fight for their lives through adrenaline-inducing experiences that have the best visuals of the genre.” 

Let Them Come: Onslaught also features roguelite elements, meaning a lot will be lost in between each run. However, credits collected on the battlefield stay with you, and you can spend them on permanent upgrades in the Armory. 
Tuatara Games says Let Them Come: Onslaught hits Steam Early Access sometime in Q1 of 2024. It will cost $4.99. The team says, “The decision to launch first on Early Access comes from [the] continued knowledge in incorporating improvements to ensure the final 1.0 launch is as optimized as possible.”]]></summary>

Perhaps embarrassed by the relatively small amount of egg on their face compared to some of their more ridiculous contemporaries, Konami have decided to come crawling back to try and buy our collective forgiveness by way of their second-only-to-Squeenix PS1 back catalogue. Well it won’t work, you swines! What’s that? Suikoden remasters? Well, it still won’t work! Metal Gear Solid on Steam, you say? Balls. Balls and zounds. 
MGS1 has, of course, been available via GOG for quite a while now. It’s a noble, if barebones port, but it does mean I have Snake-related options besides dusting off my PS1 classic, which is currently doing a bang-up job keeping a dodgy table bang-upright. Either way, I’ve found myself on a bit of Metal Gear kick recently. Phantom Pain, for all its narrative faults, holds up still as a cracking stealth sandbox rivalled only by Hitman. And MGS1 is still dramatic, still goofy, still alternately comedically overwrought and genuinely touching. But most of all, it's still haunted by the same ghosts that dwelled inside it all those years ago.

The new multi-department union represents over 200 employees at the company’s Irvine and Burbank offices, working across divisions including QA, marketing, localisation, product development, live service, and more. Yesterday’s vote had 91 workers voting “yes” and 26 voting “no.” 


AEGIS announced plans to unionise earlier this year, with goals that included higher base pay, better benefits, balanced schedules, and proper staffing to “end patterns of overwork.” At the time, AEGIS claimed that “nearly a third of Sega’s long-time workers still lack full-time status, paid time off, proper training, or even bereavement leave.”

Thankfully, Amazon Prime Day has your back, offering some pretty tasty discounts on the Samsung Pro Plus in its 256GB and 512GB varieties.

Our James reckons these specific cards are the best fit for Valve's chunky handheld, and I agree. As usual I took his advice and ended up with the 512GB card that has served me well over the last 12 months. Although the 256GB model might be enough if you're planning to stuff it full of games with a smaller footprint (such as the excellent Pizza Tower, Vampire Survivors or many other of the Steam Deck's best games), I'd recommend the 512GB card if you're leaning towards beefier titles.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Larian Studios are nothing if not enablers of wild, unspoken desires. In Divinity: Original Sin II, they provided the impossible - making each companion character a playable protagonist, and weaving their unique plotlines into the tapestry of the main story. It was one of the RPG’s great innovations - handing you a killer backstory, a tangible motivation, and a set of prompts for how you might go about roleplaying your exiled lizard prince or demon-possessed musician. For those of us who struggle with the blank page of character creation, it was a godsend (quite literally, since the adventure concerned your ascension).
Choosing a set character came with an obvious drawback, however. It robbed you of the chance to make the most of Larian’s character creation tools, fiddling with freckles and tattoos and biceps until you had an alter ego entirely your own. With Baldur's Gate 3, Larian have threaded the needle, conceiving an origin character who looks, sounds and fights however you like, yet enters the game with a frankly frightening amount of personal history and suspiciously lumpy baggage - and as they announced during the final Panel from Hell last week, some of that baggage will be soaked in blood. Optionally available as one of seven starting personalities, the Dark Urge is a mass murderer. Their species, gender, class and eyebrow thickness are up to you, but what you can’t change is their deep and insatiable need to kill for pleasure.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you've put up with a clunky clicker for too long, now's the time to pull the trigger, or in this case, press down with enough force to add the HyperX Pulsefire Haste to your basket. It's got a hefty 50% discount for Amazon Prime Day, the biggest discount since last year's Black Friday. Can I vouch for it? Yes, I have one! It's light and accurate and does a very good job of skating across my mat like a perfectly tuned puck.
The HyperX Pulsefire Haste is a cracking option if you're after a no-nonsense gaming mouse that'll stand you in good stead for anything, really. MOBAs, ARPGs, the likes of CS:GO, all handled brilliantly by the Pixart 3335 sensor. Its honeycomb shell also means it's really light, with an ambidextrous body suited to lefties or righties alike. I wouldn't say the included grip tape is all that useful, mind. Mine sort of peeled off, but I've had no qualms popping my thumbs and fingers on its plastic body.

There is, however, a lick of sense behind it. Sifting through the hundreds, if not thousands of discounted gaming wares is a time-hungry process – just ask Ed and Liam, who I’ve shandhaied into helping this year – and the main Prime Day PC gaming deals hub, the Prime Day graphics card deals hub, and the Prime Day Steam Deck accessories deals hub all tend to get larger but less frequent updates. To say nothing of the Anti-Prime Day deals guide, which also highlights savings on quality hardware from non-Amazon sellers. Keep an eye on this liveblog, though, and we’ll point out the really great stuff more or less as soon as we find it.

This is a 40% savings versus the launch price of £599, a huge discount that surpasses the last deal we've seen on AMD's fastest 12-core, 24-thread CPU by more than £100. 
I hope you can understand the excitement, as this is a great price for a high-end CPU that perfectly balances gaming and content creation performance, making it ideal for gamers that also indulge in video work, 3D rendering or coding.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EA Sports UFC 5 has been officially announced by Electronic Arts. The fifth iteration was long-presumed to be in-development, but during the UFC's tentpole International Fight Week event over the weekend, EA Sports and the UFC made it official. While no additional details were revealed outside of the logo, we know that a full reveal is coming in September of this year.
EA Sports UFC 5 marks the longest gap between entries since the series' introduction. Since the first EA Sports UFC game arrived in 2014, the games have arrived every two years, with UFC 2 arriving in 2016, UFC 3 in 2018, and UFC 4 in 2020. The series has traditionally been developed by EA Vancouver, so that's the expectation with this entry as well, but no official confirmation has been provided by EA one way or the other on that front. EA Sports UFC 5 will also mark the first game in the series to launch since the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S hit the market, so we might be able to expect a leap forward in terms of graphical fidelity and/or performance.
EA Sports UFC 4 launched on August 14, 2020, and introduced various customization options, as well as new grappling and takedown physics, plus a more fleshed-out single-player career mode. EA Sports has also continually updated the game's roster, adding tens of new fighters to the game in the time since its launch, with the most recent free update featuring Jack Della Maddalena, Erin Blanchfield, and Brandon Royval arriving just last week. For more on our thoughts on EA Sports UFC 4, check out our review here.
We'll learn more about EA Sports UFC 5 in September, but in the meantime, what do you hope is fixed, improved upon, or included in the next game? Let your thoughts be known in the comments below!]]></summary>

The Arma series usually prides itself on realistic military simulations - apart from that one kooky expansion that added aliens - so WWII is almost the perfect battlefield for the long-running shooter. 


Developer Bohemia Interactive say we’ll “be a part of the US First Army’s advance as they attempt to break through the German lines,” while using US equipment to “traverse the fields and bocage an all-new Normandy terrain.” Take a look at the impending battle below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EA has announced that a Black Panther game is in the works. The title is being made by Cliffhanger Games, a new triple-A studio based in Seattle, in collaboration with Marvel Games.
The upcoming title is billed as a single-player story-driven third-person action-adventure game. In a press release, Cliffhanger states that “Our mission is to build an expansive and reactive world that empowers players to experience what it is like to take on the mantle of Wakanda’s protector, the Black Panther.”
Cliffhanger is led by Kevin Stephens, formerly of Monolith Productions (a studio currently making a Wonder Woman game), and consists of veteran talent who have worked on titles such as Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor, God of War, Halo Infinite, and Call of Duty, among others. The team is still being assembled and is actively hiring. As such, this untitled Black Panther project is very early in development, so it will be a few years before it’s in our hands. 
“We’re dedicated to delivering fans a definitive and authentic Black Panther experience, giving them more agency and control over their narrative than they have ever experienced in a story-driven video game. Wakanda is a rich SuperHero sandbox, and our mission is to develop an epic world for players who love Black Panther and want to explore the world of Wakanda as much as we do,” said Kevin.
Black Panther made his comic debut in July 1966, and today’s news coincides with the character’s 57th anniversary. Although he’s been a playable character in numerous Marvel titles, he’s never starred in his own solo game until now. However, it's not the only upcoming game to let players assume the Black Panther mantle. Last year, Amy Hennig's Skydance New Media announced it’s making a Marvel game set during World War II starring Captain America, Black Panther Azzuri (the grandfather of T’Challa), alongside another Wakandan spy and Howling Commando member Gabriel Jones.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Capcom and Square Enix were both recently asked about whether more remasters and remakes were planned in the future. Both publishers gave non-committal responses but we know more redos/reimaginings/remakes are coming. Of course they are. Seemingly every publisher under the sun is onboard the remake train and it’s only a matter of time before your favourite game gets a nostalgic refresh. So, dear readers, what older games would you like to see return?

Over the weekend, Halo's community team posted a new blog post detailing the results of a year-long partnership with Digsite to restore lost features from Halo's cutting room floor to the Master Chief Collection - including never-before-seen maps and weapons from the archives of Halo: Combat Evolved, as well as some vehicles from the series’ earliest days as a third-person shooter and real-time strategy game.

In the first post, we went into a bit into the infrastructure that runs OpenTTD, from BaNaNaS to our main website. In this post, we will explain a bit about the migration we just did to get to this infrastructure. After over 2 months of work, I am happy to announce we finished (another) infrastructure migration. Today is the day I removed the last few DNS entries pointing to AWS’s DNS servers, and I am proud to mention that (almost) all traffic is now routed via Cloudflare (and we aren’t even receiving sponsoring to say so). In this post I want to take you with me why this migration was needed, what the benefits are, and why you possibly care. But in short summary: (Much) smaller monthly bill as AWS charges insane amounts for bandwidth. Faster download speeds for you (ranging from the in-game content service to downloading the game from our website). Easier maintainability of our infrastructure with thanks to Pulumi. This will be a bit nerdy, so if you like these kind of things, continue the read!]]></summary>

However, somewhere along the line, YTS decided to disobey this agreement.

        <updated>2023-07-07T13:05:39.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sonic the Hedgehog co-creator Yuji Naka has been given a suspended prison sentence for insider trading.
News of this sentencing comes from IGN (via IGN Japan), which reports that the 57-year-old was "found guilty of violating Japan's Financial Instruments and Exchange Act" for insider trading after a July 7 court appearance at the Tokyo District Court. The judge in the case gave Naka a two-and-a-half-year prison sentence but suspended for four years, and two fines of 2 million yen and 170 million yen (approximately $14,000 and $1.1 million respectively). 
This sentencing comes roughly a month after Abema Times reported in June that prosecutors on the case were asking that Naka go to prison for two years and six months and fines totaling roughly $1.2 million. However, Naka's defense asked that this fine and prison sentence be reduced. The final verdict arrived on July 7 in Japan. 
Naka, who also directed Balan Wonderworld, was arrested in November in connection to an insider trading investigation centered around a new Dragon Quest game. Naka was accused of purchasing 10,000 shares worth 2.8 million yen (roughly $20,000) in Aiming, the company behind that new mobile Dragon Quest game. 
Less than a month later, Naka was arrested once more on a second charge of insider trading; this time involving the now-defunct mobile battle royale, Final Fantasy VII: The First Soldier. Naka was accused of purchasing 120,000 shares in Ateam, the developer behind the game, for approximately 144.7 million yen (more than $1 million). 
Naka has now been formally charged and sentenced for insider trading.

IGN first reported the announcement yesterday after spotting tributes to Morel on LinkedIn. Ubisoft Montpellier, the primary Ubisoft studio leading development on Beyond Good and Evil 2, then released a statement about Morel's passing on LinkedIn as well: 
Morel joined Ubisoft in 2009, according to his LinkedIn, and his credits in games include Rayman Legends and The Adventures of Tintin. He was an associate creative director on Beyond Good and Evil 2 before being promoted to creative director earlier this year (via Kotaku). Before Ubisoft, Morel worked at Eden Games on Test Drive Unlimited and the Alone in the Dark series.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Diablo IV’s first season kicks off on July 20, and it’s called Season of the Malignant. Blizzard revealed a new trailer along with details of the content update in a livestream today. 
Season of the Malignant introduces a new questline set after the main campaign in which Malignant Monsters, born from Lilith’s corruption, are terrorizing Sanctuary. It’s up to you and a former priest named Cormond to locate and eradicate the source of this blight. 


Killing these creatures lets players harness their corrupted hearts to transform into new powers. Up to 30 new Malignant abilities are borne from these monsters, and this power can be imbued into Rings and Amulets. This update also introduces a new boss in the form of Varshan the Consumed. Players can also earn six new Unique items and seven Le…]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-07-06T18:11:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In 2020, we learned that Keiichiro Toyama, the creator of Silent Hill, had opened Bokeh Game Studio to develop a new horror game. The following year, at The Game Awards 2021, Bokeh revealed Slitterhead. Thanks to a new development diary released today, we can peek at more early-development gameplay in action. 
Most of the video focuses on the developers working on Slitterhead, with a particular look at user tests and gameplay feedback. However, sprinkled throughout the diary are new clips of Slitterhead, ranging from training room-esque encounters, some clips of a neon-lit Chinese city, and even a dog that appears to be playable. 
Check it out for yourself: 


As you can see in the small and often blurred snippets of Slitterhead gameplay, the studio's debut game continues to look grotesque. We see a character attack enemies using Wolverine-like claws, guns, and more. Oh, and below is that playable dog: 
In 2020, the studio said its debut horror game would be released in 2023. But there's no word on whether the team still anticipates releasing it this year. And given how early in development today's gameplay looks, it's looking more like a 2024 or beyond game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[NetherRealm has revealed two more playable fighters joining the Mortal Kombat 1 roster: Smoke and Rain. 
These two returning characters were revealed as actual fighters on the roster – they still could be part of the Kameo roster, however – in a new gameplay trailer released today focused on the Lin Kuei faction. In it, we witness Scorpion and Sub-Zero's further attempts to establish this faction in Liu Kang's newly rebooted Mortal Kombat universe (hence the Mortal Kombat 1 title), where Smoke and Rain come into play. 
Check these two fighters out in the Lin Kuei gameplay trailer below: 


"With deep ties to Scorpion and Sub-Zero, Smoke has made the clan's mission his own and joins his Lin Kuei brethren in defense of Earthrealm," a press release reads. "The trailer also provides a first look at Rain, the High Mage of Outworld who has honed his craft of water magic into a fierce weapon and now hopes to learn the realm's darkest and most powerful sorcery." 
Elsewhere in the trailer, you might have spotted Sektor, Cyrax, Frost, and Scorpion as Kameo fighters. 

Mortal Kombat 1 hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch, and PC via Steam and the Epic Games Store on September 19, 2023.

        <updated>2023-07-06T15:58:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Despite having pretty enjoyable gameplay, AEW: Fight Forever is woefully light on features and modes. That gets remedied a bit with the announcement that Stadium Stampede is hitting the game in an upcoming free update. 
Stadium Stampede sees up to 30 wrestlers compete in a free-for-all inside a giant empty stadium. Like the real-life version, insanity is the name of the game, as players can assault each other using whatever is around them, whether it's chairs, tee shirt guns, Molotovs, golf carts, or even ride atop a horse. The last competitor standing wins, and the reveal trailer sells how much of a goofy mess it’s going to be (in a good way, hopefully). 


Unfortunately, there's no release date for this update other than that it's coming soon. AEW: Fight Forever has other DLC heading its way in the form of downloadable wrestler packs. FTR (Dax Harwood and Cash Wheeler) were added last month, and a pack containing Keith Lee and The Bunny becomes available on July 25. The final announced pack arrives on August 22 and adds Hook and Danhausen. Each of these packs also includes two new minigames. Each pack costs $11.99 and is included with the season pass.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Capcom has formally revealed the first fighter joining the Street Fighter 6 roster post-launch, and it's Rashid, a returning fighter who first appeared in Street Fighter 5. 
Rashid hits the game on July 24, so there are still a few weeks to go until he's playable. All owners of the game's Deluxe Edition, Ultimate Edition, and Year 1 Character Pass can play as him. You can also play Rashid for up to one hour for free using a Rental Fighter ticket, which is obtainable in the in-game Fighting Pass. 
Check out the Street Fighter 6 Rashid gameplay trailer below for a look at what to expect: 


Rashid will be playable in all three of Street Fighter 6's modes: World Tour, where he'll be added to the story mode with unique moves for your custom avatar, the Fighting Ground as the 19th playable character; and the Battle Hub, where you can earn Rashid-related gear, emotes, and more. Moves to look out for include Arabian Cyclone, Arabian Skyhigh, Super Rashid Kick, Ysaar, and Altair.
Rashid hits Street Fighter 6 on July 24. He'll be joined by upcoming fighters like A.K.I., Ed, and Akuma this year. 
While waiting for Rashid to join the roster, read Game Informer's Street Fighter 6 review to find out why we love the game so much, and then check out this upcoming Street Fighter 6 collaboration coming to Exoprimal.

“It went from a costume that weighed about 35 pounds to over 200 pounds,” Fireball says. “The foam, like a sponge, just absorbed the water, and I just started to sink.” Mistaking his outreached hand for a thumbs up, Kathy and the crew were excited as they watched her husband fight for his life underwater.

But it might surprise you to learn Netflix is trying to add its name to that list.
Open your Netflix app right now. Scroll past the big new releases, the recommended movies and TV shows, past the trending now section, and you’ll finally see it: Netflix Games, offering “no ads, extra fees or in-app purchases” and “unlimited access to exclusive games,” all included with the standard subscription. A few of these titles don’t have mobile versions elsewhere, yet they sit on Netflix’s mobile app. How did that happen? Read more...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If Ubisoft's summer showcase was any indication, it's going all-in on Assassin's Creed. But a recent report from Kotaku suggests that the company's commitment to the franchise might be going even deeper than we thought; Ubisoft has recently begun the process of remaking Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag. 
The remake is currently in "its earliest stages," Kotaku reports, so details are scarce, and we won't be seeing it officially for a few years. A team at Ubisoft Singapore, a branch that has contributed to almost every mainline Assassin's Creed game, is said to be heavily involved. Most notably, Ubisoft Singapore worked on the creation of naval combat for Assassin's Creed III and IV, a success that would place it at the head of development for Ubisoft's naval-focused game, Skull and Bones. Of course, Skull and Bones is now notorious for its years of repeated delays – fans of Black Flag will just have to hope the seas will be calmer for the studio's next project.


Black Flag was released in 2013 on the eve of a new console generation, coming to PS3 and 360, but also to PS4, Xbox One, and Wii U. The game follows Edward Kenway – the pirate grandfather of the protagonist Connor from Assassin's Creed III – as he plunders the Caribbean and stumbles into the Assassin Brotherhood. Combining the series' classic stealth gameplay with naval exploration and combat, it's widely regarded as one of the franchise's best entries. Check out our review here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Exoprimal is built using Capcom’s proprietary RE Engine, which is surprising considering the other Capcom games that have used the engine are quite different. The first game to publicly use it was Resident Evil 7: Biohazard, which caused many to dub the engine the Resident Evil engine, which is not what the ‘RE’ stands for. Instead, the acronym is confusingly shorthand for Reach for the Moon. In Japan, the Resident Evil series is called Biohazard, which is why Exoprimal technical director Kazuki Abe is surprised that anyone ever thought the engine was named after the survivor horror series . “It’s really just a matter of coincidence that Resident Evil games are also developed using this engine.”
Since Resident Evil 7, RE Engine has been used to develop Resident Evil Village, the Resident E…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Scorn was one of the most enigmatic and polarizing games when it crept to Xbox and PC last fall. Some love it, some despise it, and PlayStation fans will get to see which side of the fence they fall on when it hits PlayStation 5 this fall.
Despite appearing like a shooter on its surface, Scorn is an atmospheric puzzle-focused experience. As a strange humanoid creature, you’ll explore a labyrinthian H.R. Giger-inspired alien world to unravel its mysteries. While combat is present, it’s very much secondary to deciphering the abstract story and riddles, and even those revelations will primarily be up to your interpretation. 
The PlayStation 5 version features DualSense haptic feedback support and 4K/60 fps gameplay. Check out the game’s new trailer below.]]></summary>
