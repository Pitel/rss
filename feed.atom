        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Are you team digital or team physical?
Super Smash Bros. Ultimate creator Masahiro Sakurai has tackled a hot topic in his latest YouTube upload - discussing the pros and cons of digital and physical game collections.
Sakurai admits he's "team digital all the way" and doesn't really consider himself to be a collector. Rather than focusing on the game's packaging, he prefers to hold onto the "experience" he has when playing these games. He also mentions how he no longer really has the space for a large physical game library and opts to keep things compact with folders and other storage solutions.

That suit alleged that CDPR had "made materially false or misleading statements" regarding the game, particularly as related to the condition of its console release, and sought damages.

Now a proposed settlement has been approved by a federal judge in California's Central District. The settlement reached will see CDPR pay out $1.85 million USD (around £1.52m GBP), or roughly $0.49 per eligible share.

'Nuh uh', say Arkane, in a new interview with Games Radar. Redfall apparently has more in common with Far Cry than Valve's co-op classic.

When FromSoftware announced Armored Core VI Fires of Rubicon at The Game Awards in December, a few very predictable things happened. Fans of FromSoftware's more recent output wondered whether or not this weird mech thing had anything to do with Dark Souls. Fans of Armored Core awoke from their decade-long coma to become immediately defensive, clarifying that Armored Core is a lot older than the Souls superseries, and that the two have nothing in common.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gal-Ag-Ah?
Following on from last week's addition of Taito's iconic Bubble Bobble, Hamster has got another pioneering classic lined up for that Arcade Archives, in the form of Namco's legendary shmup Galaga, now available to download on PS4 and Nintendo Switch.
Launched in 1981 as the sequel to the genre-defining Galaxian, Galaga is one of the most instantly recognizable titles of the formative years of the arcade. Players control a lone ship, piloting through the stars and taking on the invading forces of Galaga. Building upon Galaxian's award-winning action, Galaga offered an improved audio/video package, as well as cool new features such as the famous "Tractor Beam" enemy, and the ability for both the player and the enemy to morph into boosted variants of themselves.
Check out the classic interstellar action in the video below, courtesy of YouTuber World of Longplays.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29VVkfuXkVI&ab_channel=WorldofLongplays
Designed and developed by a small team within Namco, led by Shigeru Yokoyama, Galaga far surpassed the company's expectations, gaining the attention of the executives, which lead to increased efforts in marketing and shipping of the finished product. Galaga was a global smash on release, and would continue to be a mainstay of arcade centers well through the crash and into the late '80s. A gaming icon, Galaga has popped up in multiple movies — including WarGames, The Karate Kid, and The Avengers — and has even had an extinct species of prehistoric shark named after it!
Not a bad legacy at all for some old-school pew-pew action.
Galaga is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at around $8.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A picturesque new story is on the way from the OPUS team
Developer SIGONO has been making some waves with its narrative adventures, and now the team has announced its next project. OPUS: Prism Peak is a new game from SIGONO, and it's taking a look through a camera lens for its story.
SIGONO has developed several different narrative adventures under the OPUS banner, stretching back to 2016's OPUS: The Day We Found Earth. The Taiwanese studio found some breakout success with 2021's OPUS: Echo of Starsong, which received both audience critical acclaim, and found its way to the Switch with the Full Bloom Edition.
With OPUS: Prism Peak, the studio seems like its looking towards the camera for a new perspective. With the tagline "Capture the moment, then learn to let go," it certainly seems poised for some powerful emotions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdMesmRJRNQ
According to its Steam page, OPUS: Prism Peak is an adventure where choices will lead to diverging endings, as you play a photographer lost in an ethereal realm. You'll have to use your camera to uncover mysteries and find a way home through all of it.
The camera eye
Not much more information has been shared just yet, but the premise alone is very intriguing. The camera has become a cool way of viewing video game worlds, whether on the arcade-like railways of Pokemon Snap or snapping shots of the final days in Umurangi Generation.
With a team like SIGONO behind it, OPUS: Prism Peak could be another one to watch in the realm of camera-based adventure. Hopefully we'll hear more about this project soon. Meanwhile, that leaves plenty of time to check out the other OPUS games.

Oh my god it's 2023 and it's time for Whatcha Been Playing! I'd like to wish all of you a very, very happy new year, and I hope that this fresh turn on the merry-go-round of life opens up a world of excitement, happiness, and possibility for you all. Even if it actually ends up being a little more low-key than usual, then I still want you to receive all of the simple pleasures and small joys that you deserve.
It must be said that we've all really been up against it in the early years of the new decade, with a lot of challenges that, frankly, nobody saw coming. But I think you've handled it marvelously. You've figured it out and made it work — as you always have — And I'm hoping that 2023 responds kindly by offering you good health, good opportunity, and good company.

At the end of last year, The Pokémon Company announced Ash and Pikachu's anime adventures would be coming to a close after 25 years. The series will give the iconic duo a special send-off in an 11-episode run, which will begin airing next week in Japan on 13th January.
Now, ahead of the first episode, TPC has shared a brief rundown about what to expect from the first three episodes - revealing the return of Misty and Brock. The group went their separate ways in the episode "Gotta Catch Ya Later!". Here's some information about their return (via Siliconera):

It's 2023 and the lights are back on at Nintendo Life Towers. While January can often be something of a sleepy month as the gaming industry rears its head from a Christmas-induced slumber, we are up and raring to dive into what looks to be an interesting year for Nintendo.
This week, we have shared our thoughts on 2023's first big release, Fire Emblem Engage, as we got our hands on the game for a preview. We have also been looking forward to the year ahead as some of our writers got together to discuss their gaming predictions. Then, to top it all off, we dove into the ultimate question of Hyrule as we attempted to find the very best Zelda-themed Nintendo console.

Ahead of the release of Fire Emblem Engage later this month, the Dutch Nintendo fansite N1-UP has uploaded the game's opening cinematic to its YouTube channel. This footage was apparently captured during a preview session at Nintendo.
A lot of reactions are saying how it's got anime vibes, and it's easy to see why. You can also hear the song in this opening, and there's a brief look at the game's title screen towards the end. We won't be sharing the video directly here, but you can check it via the tweet below:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We all scream for Scream Tail
The competitive battling scene in Pokemon Scarlet & Violet has been fascinating to watch. As new strategies have formed around the monsters introduced in Generation 9, top-tier battlers have had their work cut out for them trying to counter the emerging threats. Who could have guessed that Maushold had some of the highest damage potential in the game? Or how about Murkrow becoming one of the most used Pokemon?
As it turns out, the competitive scene faces another significant shakeup. Courtesy of Serebii, Paradox Pokemon will officially be removed from the ban list when Series 2 of Scarlet & Violet’s Ranked Battle modes begin on February 1st. This includes 14 endgame monsters that feature near-legendary base stats and powerful abilities. Even one Pokemon has the potential to change the metagame completely, so the addition of Paradox Pokemon will almost assuredly send ripples throughout the scene. Smogon, a hub for fan driven competitive Pokemon play, already ruled two of these Pokemon too powerful for its popular 6v6 singles format.

Some still can't join
Paradox Pokemon will be the only new monsters in Series 2. Tera Raid exclusives like Charizard and Cinderace are still off the table for Ranked Battles. Furthermore, the Ruinous Quartet and Legendary Pokemon remain off-limits. Still, we’re bound to see entirely new strategies emerge with these monsters entering the fold. Pokemon that have seen no usage so far may become valuable strictly to counter these new threats.
Pokemon Scarlet & Violet have been critically contentious, but the interest in the official competitive scene is as strong as it has ever been. Even non-battlers can have fun watching how Paradox Pokemon fit into high-end play. Series 2 will run until March 31st, 2023.

NetEase has picked up a new studio in SkyBox Labs. The established studio, known for co-developing on some major games, joins NetEase's growing roster of games studios.
SkyBox Labs has co-developed on several big projects, including Halo Infinite and Minecraft. It will continue to operate independently, and plans to work with both existing and new partners to continue co-developing games.
Shyang Kong, a co-founder of SkyBox Labs, said in a press release that the team will remain committed to growing its presence in Canada, on top of supporting current and future partners and undertaking more co-development projects.
"We have built a team of talented individuals who are passionate and creative, and by joining NetEase Games, we will also be able to accelerate our plans to pursue new creative opportunities, and enjoy access to world-class operational resources and the full breadth and depth of NetEase’s services so we can scale faster in Canada," said Kong.

A growing roster
NetEase has been picking up quite a few studios over the last few years, including Detroit: Become Human developer Quantic Dream and Suda51's Grasshopper Manufacture.
The tech company has also built up a roster of new studios, too. NetEase established Jackalope Games last year in Austin, with former Daybreak head Jack Emmert at the helm. Yakuza creator Toshihiro Nagoshi also established a new development house, Nagoshi Studio, under NetEase after leaving Sega.

Among Us has been one of the biggest games in the world since it blew up at the start of the pandemic in 2020 — its staying power is evidenced by its cameo in Rian Johnson's latest whodunit flick Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery. Even with all the clout that still surrounds the game, it was still dethroned by another social deduction game that takes enough inspiration from Among Us that it's bordering on rip-off territory: Goose Goose Duck.
That's right, a game that basically just swaps out Among Us' signature bean-shaped crewmates with goofy-looking geese has surpassed the original's record for concurrent players — Among Us peaked at 447,476 players two years ago, while Goose Goose Duck had a peak (or should I say beak?)…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Save data will be transferable to the full game
Bandai Namco's shonen RPG One Piece Odyssey goes live a week from now. But if you can't wait that long, there's also a demo arriving for One Piece Odyssey next week to tide you over until launch.
Producer Katsuaki Tsuzuki announced in a new video today that a One Piece Odyssey demo will go live on January 10, just ahead of its January 13 launch date.
The demo will cover roughly the first couple hours of One Piece Odyssey, and save data from the demo will transfer over to the full game. It will follow Luffy and the crew washing up on the island where Odyssey takes place, coming face-to-face with new obstacles to overcome, and likely plenty of RPG battles.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bBWs1dYFwk
Tsuzuki says the demo will highlight specific parts of what makes Odyssey a bit different, including its RPG bend towards tactical battles rather than action-heavy fights. The producer does note that since RPGs tend to have various elements unlock gradually over time, not all of the features can be discovered in the demo version.
Specifically, the memory worlds shown so far won't be in the demo. These are areas that let the Straw Hat Pirates revisit pieces of their past, going back to old memories of places to relive them. Those will be available after the demo version.
Setting sail
While it's a short span of time between demo and launch, this is at least a good chance to try out One Piece Odyssey to see if it's for you. While One Piece is no stranger to more action-oriented adaptations, Odyssey dives into the realm of RPGs. It's an interesting twist, and one that actually has me—an anime and RPG fan who doesn't normally vibe with One Piece—fairly interested.
The chance to try it out will arrive on January 10. Otherwise, One Piece Odyssey sets off on January 13 for PC, PlayStation 4, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Roguelike deckbuilders are everywhere, nowadays, which is just how I like it. Roguelike deckbuilders that carve out a path far afield of Slay The Spire are a little rarer, though, so I also like that Luck Be A Landlord just left Steam Early Access. 
It's about adding symbols to a slot machine, rather than removing monsters from a dungeon. You emerge from each run with sentences less like 'damn, if only I'd picked more block cards' and more like 'damn, if only I hadn't invested so much in coal and instead focused on feeding milk to my cats'.

2022 has been an incredible year for games, and along with them, exciting new video game characters. From enigmatic movie stars to adorably pixelated version of extinct animals, the host of fresh faces games introduced to us has been nothing short of delightful, thought-provoking, and badass. As time goes on, our memories of certain game mechanics or buggy technical details may fade, but what will always remain are our memories of the virtual friends we made along the way. It's the way they act as our analog into the digital worlds we explore, and the way they stare into our souls, that will stick with us for years to come.

Konami is responsible for my top three games on the Sega Genesis console. I’ve covered Rocket Knight Adventures and Castlevania: Bloodlines already, but the third is Contra: Hard Corps. The thing is, while the former two titles are difficult trials in their own right, Contra: Hard Corps is one that I’ve never been able to fully consummate with. It’s hard. It’s right there in the title.
The biggest reason why these three titles are even difficult is that Konami had this strange insistence on using limited continues at the time. Contra has always limited how many continues you get on the console games, but Castlevania? That’s just dirty. But even then, Contra: Hard Corps is difficult beyond what I’ve experienced in previous games, and I’ll delve deeper into the reason. The bigge…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Moira mains are delighted, though
Moira used to be one of the most reliable picks among the lineup of Overwatch's healers. Her abilities aren't difficult to use which makes them viable for players of all skill ranges, plus she has great survivability and can deal good damage when it's needed. When Overwatch 2 dropped, however, Moira took on a new life with the five-player teams, and most will say these changes weren't for the best. A whole host of players decided they were tired of healing and wanted to use her as a glorified damage dealer. This is where the DPS Moira controversy began, and it's only snowballed from there.
Fast forward to now, and Blizzard released some new patch notes announcing a buff to the notorious Irish scientist. Now "dealing damage with Biotic Orb now restores a small amount of Biotic Energy," or for laymen like me, when you deal damage with the purple ball it regenerates some of the yellow healing stuff you spray on your teammates. I guess the idea is that since players are going full DPS Moira anyway, they might as well make it easier to give your teammates more healing.
https://twitter.com/PlayOverwatch/status/1611142281775484928
I'm fairly skeptical that this change is going to be good in the long run, but that might be my knee-jerk reaction to hearing about another Moira buff. I want to say I trust that Blizzard knows what they're doing, but as of late my confidence in them has been waning. It'll be a waiting game to see how this buff affects play, and whether the devs will have to come back with a nerf in the near future.
These patch notes also detail the new Greek-themed arcade event Battle for Olympus, the new competitive season starting on January 10, and other balance changes for characters like Junker Queen, Zarya, and Brigitte.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[And then two come along at once...
Japanese publisher City Connection, fresh off of the back of yesterday's Puzzle Bobble announcement, has revealed another classic title is joining its S-Tribute range: Taito's space blaster Metal Black, which will launch on PC and consoles on February 2.
The S-Tribute release will be an adaptation not of Metal Black's 1991 arcade release, which ironically hit Hamster's Arcade Archives just two months ago, but is instead a rerelease of Ving's 1996 Sega Saturn port. This new S-Tribute release, in keeping with other titles in the range, will include a selection of new quality-of-life features, including save states, a rewind function, slow-motion mode, various dip-switch settings, online leaderboards, and arcade-style scanline filters.
Check out a playthrough of the Sega Saturn edition below, via YouTuber NintendoComplete.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaKMxu3K2NY&ab_channel=NintendoComplete
Metal Black is a horizontally scrolling sci-fi shmup set within the timeline of a devasted Earth, recovering from the damage caused by a horrendous meteor attack. Following this catastrophic event, an alien force attempts to enslave the planet, leading to the surrender of humanity. One lone pilot, however, is not quite ready to kneel, and absconds with the hi-tech "CF-345 Black Fly” vessel, in a one-man, do-or-die effort to turn the conquering alien force into space dust.
As previously noted, Metal Black is not one of the shmup genre's prettiest efforts, having launched during Taito's early '90s "ugly-ass-visuals" period. But it does contain a solid soundtrack, some cool boss characters, and two differing conclusions and is worth checking out for shmup completionists.
Metal Black S-Tribute launches February 2 on PS4, PC, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch

Over the past week, shoppers have been heading into Walmart in the US only to discover, to their surprise, that Pokémon Squishmallows — which were previously only being sold on the Pokémon Center website — available to buy on the shop floor. Of course, they're already sold out online, so anyone who wants one of these squishy Pikachus or Gengars is out of luck — unless they get lucky at a Walmart, apparently.
Here are some of the individual reports of Pokémallow sightings:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At least so far.
Don't get me wrong, I'm really enjoying Marvel Snap! I play a few matches every day, and I have favorite cards that I keep in my deck purely out of sentimental value. I like figuring out deck builds on my own rather than looking them up. Not that there's anything wrong with looking up the tried and true ways to combine cards that work together, but I like the challenge of figuring it out as I go. Which is probably why it is taking me so long to climb the ladder.
Realizing how behind I am, I started thinking about things like the Season Pass or the bundles that I occasionally see. Usually, my eyes just glaze over these things. I have had zero interest in buying anything from Marvel Snap, no matter how much fun it is. When I finally paid attention, I almost spit out my coffe…]]></summary>

So when I say that I don't love Asterigos Colon Curse of the Stars, it's not as damning as it may sound.
You're Hilda, a stabby lass who, for reasons, must investigate and lift a curse from a big ol' fantasy city. By exploring its districts and stabbing lots of weird dudes. Aiding you is a network of semi-suspicious locals, and the kind of immortality that makes death more annoying than anything. It's a hybrid, really, of a Souls-ish game and a more traditional hack and slash action RPG. Regular attacks don't consume stamina, and instead of finding or buying weapons, you start out with a complete set, and swap their movesets in and out as needed. I respect that it picks and chooses soulsy elements instead of tracing over the whole design.

Microsoft has filed a revised version of its response to the Federal Trade Commission's lawsuit over the Activision Blizzard merger. While similar in broad strokes, it does specifically remove a series of points questioning the constitutionality of the FTC's actions.
In a revision spotted by Axios, Microsoft removed a section claiming that the FTC was working counter to the United States Constitution or the 5th Amendment. While the new filing does still argue that Microsoft's potential acquisition of Activision Blizzard would not stifle competition, it has backed off on some of those aforementioned claims that the FTC is infringing on rights.

With the hotly-discussed Pokémon Scarlet and Violet hitting the shelves last year and news of Ash and Pikachu leaving the anime for good, it is sometimes easy to forget that Pokémon cards are one of the most enduring elements of the franchise. While some will have fallen off the collecting bandwagon as the years have gone by, this returning storytelling feature was enough to make us consider getting back to the packs.
Noted on Twitter by YouTuber @Purplecliffe, some of the latest Pokémon cards tell a heartwarming little story when a 'mon's evolutions are put side by side. In the example given below, we see little Ralts and its young owner spend their lives together through moving house, childbirth and old age.

I also didn't know that last month the author of that poem, Julian Gough, placed it into the public domain, which according to him he's legally entitled to do because nobody at Mojang or Microsoft ever successfully got him to sign a contract.
He now says Microsoft are stonewalling any attempts to contact them about whether or not they own the copyright, and that this silence killed a piece he'd written for an unnamed "global news organisation" because they didn't want to risk drawing the ire of Microsoft's 1700 strong lawer team. That piece was actually an edited version of Gough's blog post from last month, where he explained the situation and submitted the poem to the public domain - while making multiple references to the poem being written by the universe, and also how taking psychedelics lead him to conclude that not allowing himself to be compensated would be a "blockage of the flow of love". It's a trip.

Described as a spiritual sibling to their most recent OPUS game, the brilliant Echo Of Starsong, the exact magic combo of words that made my eyes go all wide and saucer-like was "a cross between What Remains Of Edith Finch and Makoto Shinkai films", which just - you know what, I'm going to shut up now so you can watch the teaser trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It is a step up from many other 3D Sonic games (low bar, I know)
Sonic Frontiers seems to be doing well for a 3D Sonic game, both in terms of the critical and commercial reception. Many folks (myself included) agree that while there are technical issues that still need to be squashed, it does have a lot of good qualities, and is a great bar for the next iteration of an open world Sonic formula. For many, that's not going to be worth a sight unseen full MSRP price tag: but both of those deals have been altered a bit, in a good way!
As of this week, Sega surprise-dropped a Sonic Frontiers demo, which you can find either on the eShop on your actual Switch, or through the official listing here (just look for the "download demo" text below the main title). Perhaps not coincidentally, Sonic Frontiers is on sale now for $41.99 on the eShop (down from $59.99), so you can pick it up for a bit cheaper than at launch if you do dig it. Note that the sale does end on January 15 at 11:59PM PT, so you have some time to decide.
As we wait for a brand new iteration/Sonic Frontiers sequel, 2023 is looking bright for the game, as a huge roadmap was recently unveiled. More quality of life mechanics, challenges, characters, and even story content is all on the way.
Download the Sonic Frontiers Switch demo here
Just in case you missed it, there you go! The demo clocks in at 3.1GB.

But Infinite’s take on Forge is more robust, allowing forgers to create maps that don’t look like they belong in Halo. No, seriously, what is Whiterun doing in Infinite?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This game seem 'sus to you?
Epic Games has revealed the identity of the next title that it will be offering up to its users, free of charge, on its digital retail outlet Epic Games Store — Available to all as of January 12, the new freebie is Invisible Walls multiplayer mystery title First Class Trouble.
Launched on PC and PlayStation in November 2021, First Class Trouble sees a literal party of players shipped about a top-tier, highly elite space cruiser — the ISS Alithea. While the guests sip sweet champagne and carouse with the locals, the ship's A.I. unit, CAIN, goes rogue and decides to shut down the party and its patrons, permanently. Manifesting several lifelike androids known as "Personoids", CAIN attempts to sabotage the vessel's mainframe, while our inebriated toffs mount a rebellion n order to identify the Personoids, crush CAIN, and get back to drinking the night away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_uu_fZJxLQ&ab_channel=PlayStation
From a gameplay standpoint, First Class Trouble sees six players take the roles of guests and/or Personoids, with the former tasked with identifying and ejecting the latter, who themselves must disrupt the ship's mechanisms without being detected. If this all sounds suspiciously familiar — or should I simply say "'sus" — then that's by design, as First Class Trouble is essentially an alternate take on the party mystery genre popularized by InnerSloth's viral hit Among Us, albeit one sporting a bit more of a "Gatsby" vibe.
First Class Trouble will be available to download from the Epic Games Store from January 12. Until then, you can still pick up current freebies Kerbal Space Program and Shadow Tactics – Aiko’s Choice from the EGS dashboard. First Class Trouble is also available on PlayStation platforms via the PSN store.

Those of you who have been around for a few years, the process will be quite similar to the last few, but I'll go over the tenants of our democratic system for those who don't know.

According to reports from the number crunchers over at market study groups GfK and GSD, 2022 was a tougher year than usual for UK gaming retailers, with a drop in the sales of both consoles and games when compared to 2021.
Over the course of the year, some 34.2 million games were sold to UK players. While that number is not to be sniffed at, it represents a 6% drop on 2021. 20 million of these sales were digital, for a loss of 3.4% over 2021, while the remaining 14.2 physical sales represent a 9% drop year-on-year. Interestingly, this reduction in sales is attributed to the release of newly-released titles, which has caused an increasing trend of players not purchasing back catalog titles with the same regularity as they once mig…]]></summary>

When I first asked the team to put together their most anticipated games for 2023, I was thinking we'd have a reasonably sensible number of things we were all looking forward to, you know, somewhere in the region of the 43 games we highlighted at the start of 2022. Very quickly, though, it became apparent that, actually, there are simply loads of games the RPS Treehouse is personally excited about this year, and cor, it would be rude not to include every last one of them. I'll be upfront: there are a fair number of TBA games on here that probably aren't going to come out in 2023, but as ever, we remain hopeful and optimistic all the same. So let's dive in.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Don't expect The Last of Us HBO show to extend beyond the story of the two games in the series. That's because The Last of Us game director Neil Druckmann says there are no plans for stories beyond the games in this show.
This news comes by way of a new interview with Druckmann from The Hollywood Reporter, as reported by GameSpot. Here's what Druckmann told THR specifically: "We have no plans to tell any stories beyond adapting the games. We won't run into the same issue as Game of Thrones since The Last of Us Part: II doesn't end on a cliffhanger." 


Druckmann and TV series writer Craig Mazin have mentioned that a second season of this show might cover the events of The Last of Us Part II (personally, I think The Last of Us Part II could cover two seasons of television). Despite the duo not wanting the show to go beyond the games, there might be a way for the show to cover more ground after the events of The Last of Us Part II. If Naughty Dog were to develop a theoretical The Last of Us Part III, it wouldn't be surprising if the HBO show covered that down the road. Chances seem pretty good considering Druckmann told THR that there is "more story to tell" in the world of The Last of Us games. 
Mazin also touched on his desire not to extend the show beyond the games in the THR interview, as noted by GameSpot, stating that he doesn't "have any interest in a spinning-plates-go-on-forever show." 
"When it becomes a perpetual motion machine, it just can't help but get kind of...stupid," he continued. "Endings mean everything to me." 
For more about The Last of Us on HBO, read our interview with Joel actor Pedro Pascal and Druckmann about the changes made for this TV show. Check out this new piece of concept art from The Last of Us multiplayer game that Naughty Dog is currently developing after that.

The class action lawsuit that was filed against CD Projekt RED for the disastrous launch state of its mega-selling RPG Cyberpunk 2077 has been settled for $1.85 million USD.
The suit, filed on December 24, 2020 by New York's Rosen Law Firm was launched by a party of investors who accused CDPR of misleading its shareholders over the quality of the title, which famously launched in disastrous fashion on PS4 and Xbox One back in December 2020. The suit argued that CDPR offered "materially false and misleading" statements on the title in its development stages, before finally releasing Cyberpunk 2077 in a "virtually unplayable" fashion.

One of the biggest and surprisingly engaging new features in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet is the ability to create sandwiches when setting up for a picnic in the world of Paldea.
There's an awful lot of sandwiches to choose from once you've got all the relevant ingredients together (and for a full breakdown of every recipe available, be sure to check out our guide), but YouTube channel UnderLeveled has nevertheless taken on the task of recreating and tasting every sandwich in real life.

But perhaps more than any property that has moved from interactive medium to passive television, The Last of Us seems most suited to make the transition. Joel and Ellie’s story is an emotional and cinematic one that does not rely on player choice.
Ahead of the show’s premiere we spoke with some of the actors about the adaptation, as well as Neil Druckmann, co-creator of The Last of Us, who was heavily involved in writing the show and directed a few episodes.
Druckmann is no stranger to directing actors, even if the recording process of a TV show is different from how it works in a video game. “There is a certain luxury we have in video games that when we capture a performance, we have eve…]]></summary>

It seems like we could soon have another brawler releasing on the Nintendo Switch, with the Taiwanese Ratings Board recently listing Epic Games' free-to-play title Rumbleverse for the hybrid platform.
Rumbleverse was developed by Iron Galaxy Studios and made its debut on the Epic Store and other console platforms in August last year. Simply put, it's an "exciting" 40-person brawler royale. Although it's free, it does allow players to pay real money for add-ons, seasonal items and in-game currency.

Nintendo's marketing campaign for Fire Emblem Engage is now well and truly underway. Following previews going live, it's now released a brand new overview trailer that runs for close to nine minutes. One catch is it's only been uploaded to Nintendo's YouTube channels in Japan, so you'll have to watch the whole thing in Japanese.
It still provides a closer look at the game - showcasing the lands of the new title, the new protagonists, returning characters, the series' famous tactical gameplay and even some of the fun mini-games, like a workout one!

Dwarf Fortress has been a little engine that could in the games industry for decades, and after its full release in December, the title is finally seeing some well deserved success. It's only been out for a month, but Dwarf Fortress has managed to amass over 500,000 sales on Steam, which is a pretty big deal for a game with such humble beginnings. This number was developer Bay 12 Games' two month sales goal, meaning the team crushed it twice as quickly as they thought they would. What's more, the game has received the coveted "overwhelmingly positive" reception on the platform with well over 15,000 reviews.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new standalone competitor arrives soon
HTC has revealed its new standalone virtual reality headset, the Vive XR Elite. It's able to handle both virtual and augmented reality, and comes in at a price tag of $1,099.
Pre-orders went live today on sites like Amazon, where you can check out the specifications for this new headset. HTC's new set looks to compete with the likes of the Meta Quest, an extremely popular headset that's also cut out the cables.
This headset looks aimed to do many of the same things you'd expect out of something like the Meta Quest. It's a standalone VR headset that can also hook up to a PC for some extra power, and it has adjustable diopter dials for glasses-wearers. The battery allows for up to 2 hours of continuous power but is hot-swappable, and the screen comes in at a combined 3840 x 1920 resolution, with 110 degree field of view and 90 Hz refresh rate.
Quite interestingly, the Vive XR Elite can also fold up into a case and go on-the-go with you, like a pair of sunglasses. It's a neat trick, but certainly intriguing for folks who want their VR games to travel with them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LPZr04Xf34
As for other Vive headsets, The Verge reports that the Vive Focus 3 and Vive Pro 2 headsets will stay on sale, though the Vive Flow will likely be retired near the end of the year.
Expanding reality
This headset looks to compete in the growing market of VR/AR headsets, which is where other companies seem to be looking too. The Vive XR Elite looks to pack in some power with its headset, while still keeping things light and portable.
It's an interesting competitor to Meta's options, both for the price-bumped Quest 2 and the pricier Quest Pro. We'll have to see how this new headset fits into the landscape later on this year.

The Nintendo Wii was gaming’s greatest magic trick.
Back in 2006, the Wii felt like the next frontier of gaming. Swinging your arm to throw a bowling ball was so immersive that people broke their TVs without even thinking about it. Yet as the console aged, the luster of motion controls faded. What started with “can you imagine playing Smash Bros with the Wii remote?” quickly turned into “please do not give me the Wii remote to play Smash Bros.”
Still, the games that understood the benefits and limitations of the system were unforgettable. The Wii has some experiences you still can’t anywhere else, despite the rise of virtual reality. Even the system’s background music fills the Wii to the brim with personality. As usual, distilling a system’s years-long legacy …]]></summary>

It’s 2023 now and while I’m nervous that this year won’t be any better than the last two pandemic-filled years, at least it’s starting off with a big ol’ Nintendo Switch eShop sale.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Shadow Tactics is such a good real-time tactics stealth strategy game that it rejuvenated the genre. There's a chance you already own the sneaky samurai sim, however, and much less of a chance that you own its standalone expansion, Aiko's Choice. It's the latter that is currently being given away for free over on the Epic Games Store.

If that's not enough, wonderful slapstick spaceship builder Kerbal Space Program is free, too.

City Connection has announced the next title in its retro-loving S-Tribute range — Coming to PC and console platforms in February, the new release will feature two titles from the colorful puzzle series Puzzle Bobble, also known in western territories as Bust-a-Move.
The S-Tribute title will include 1995's Puzzle Bobble 2 and its 1996 follow-up, Puzzle Bobble 3. The new release will include the arcade versions of both games and a selection of home console ports for both titles. Both the Japanese Puzzle Bobble and western Bust-a-Move variants will be available. Also included are over 1,000 fan-created stages from Puzzle Bobble 3 and an editor, allowing players to build their own colorful stage layouts.
In addition, The Puzzle Bobble S-Tribute release features a selection of modern options, including save states, a rewind function, slow-motion mode, various dip-switch settings, and arcade-style scanline filters. So if you fancy a trip down memory lane, then the confusingly titled Puzzle Bobble 2X / Bust-a-Move 2 Arcade Edition & Puzzle Bobble 3 / Bust-a-Move 3 S-Tribute (lordy) will be available digitally on February 2 on PS4, PC, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch.
You can check out a trailer below, courtesy of Nintendo Everything.

The Nintendo eShop is celebrating the start of the year with some sales on Switch games. The new Year Sale is live right now, with decent cuts into a chunk of the Nintendo Switch's catalog.
This year's sale runs from January 5 to January 15, at 11:59 p.m. PT. Purchases here goes towards Gold Points too, so it's easy to rack up some extra spending cash.
Some highlights of this sale are actually some surprisingly recent games. For those looking to dump many, many hours into the Nintendo Switch at the start of the year, you don't need to look much further than Persona 5 Royal. The massive RPG finally made its way to Nintendo Switch last year, and the 30% cut drops the price tag down to $41.99.
Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope is also on sale, albeit only for its Gold Edition. While the 22% cut takes it down to roughly $70, just a hair above the base game's price, it also include the Season Pass. And if you want a solid tactics game with some surprising and inventive takes on the genre, you can't really go wrong with Sparks of Hope.
Heck, even Sonic Frontiers is seeing a 30% price cut, and AI: The Somnium Files - nirvanA Initiative has also dropped by 30% for the sale too. This is a solid way to catch up on some games you might have missed at the end of last year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuTcBAkyNL4
The Switch sales carry on
My personal pick from the sale is Celeste, the incredible 2018 platformer which is dropped to a mere $5 for this sale. Seriously, if you haven't played Celeste, it is well worth your time.
Some other price cuts have been popping up on the eShop too, as noted by social media sales aggregator Wario64. So if you're still looking to get a slightly obscure 3DS game like Culdcept Revolt for a low, low price, now's the time to do so.

No sound chip is as ubiquitous as the Ricoh 2AO3 found in the NES and Famicom consoles. 5-channels wide (usually only four were used), the sounds of this 8-bit microprocessor were cemented into the brains of anyone who was in the room with it. Some of the most enduring songs ever produced in video games got their start on that unassuming slab of plastic and silicon. Today, when someone wants to make a video game soundtrack sound vintage, they parrot the tones of the Ricoh 2A03.
I remember being in a discussion with someone long ago who made the observation that early video game music is like outsider art.

It's a new year, and a few more games are going free on Epic's PC storefront. Kerbal Space Program and Shadow Tactics - Aiko's Choice are free this week on the Epic Games Store.
From now until January 12, you can hop onto the Epic store and claim both Kerbal Space Program and the standalone Shadow Tactics expansion Aiko's Choice for free. These will add the games to your library for good, so even if you're not looking to play either one right now, just claiming it puts them both in your collection for later.
Kerbal Space Program is the infamous rocket-disaster simulator about launching small, unsuspecting Kerbals into orbit with your specially designed rockets. It's a straightforward concept on paper that's made more complicated when you realize it is, actually, rocket science. Playing Kerbal is a pretty fun way to learn about how hard it is to put a metal tube in space, while also cackling when your plans go spectacularly awry.
Otherwise, Aiko's Choice is a standalone expansion for Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun. The base Shadow Tactics is a fairly well-liked stealth tactics game, and Aiko's Choice is like a concentrated version of it. It's a campaign all its own, and doesn't require the base Shadow Tactics to play.

Ground control to Kerbal Tom
It's a solid pairing of games for this week's Epic giveaway. Both also sit in some interesting niches of gameplay, so this is really a good excuse to try them out without putting down any cash.
As for the next Epic Game Store freebie, the Store lists the impostor game First Class Trouble as its next upcoming game giveaway. That's expected to go live on January 12, and be available to grab through January 19.

Players control Kai, a lone warrior battling an evil robotic army in a post-apocalyptic world. This side-scrolling action title boasts plenty of satisfying action thanks to Kai’s fun melee combat, nimble platforming abilities, and his signature grappling hook, which he uses to traverse levels as well as yank and toss enemies. Sporting great 16-bit art and a strong soundtrack, Gravity Circuit is worth keeping an eye on for fans of classic throwbacks. 
Join editors Wesley LeBlanc and Marcus Stewart as they explore Gravity Circuit’s free Steam demo and discuss why it may be one of the year’s most exciting indie gems.

Electronic Arts has addressed a major data storage glitch that has caused untold damage to the save data of many Madden 23 players. The glitch — which struck EA servers between Wednesday, December 28 and Thursday, December 29 — has corrupted the Franchise save files of many users, essentially deleting their custom leagues entirely.
"Unfortunately, if you logged into franchise leagues during this time, your data was affected due to a data storage issue that resulted in franchise files being corrupted," said EA in a statement. "We know how important your franchises are to you, and we are actively working on a fix to restore some files via a backup as soon as possible."
However, EA noted that, unfortunately, many of the affected save files were beyond repair, and that, of all corrupted data, only around 40% of users would find their Franchise data salvageable. Thus, it is simply a nerve-rattling case of "fingers crossed" for all those affected, as they wait to see whether their custom leagues — that they have no doubt poured many, many hours into curating — have been permanently wiped.
More information is expected from the EA tech team next week, and users are asked to keep a close watch on the official Madden 23 Twitter. Wishing you luck if this concerns you.

Many JRPGs have slow openings, taking their time to establish the story and familiarize the player with the mechanics before letting them loose into the world. I figured that was the case after playing an hour of Dragon Quest Treasures, so I said to myself, “It’ll get good soon!” I said it again two hours in, three hours in, and five hours in, until eventually, I was forced to accept that this was as good as the game would get. Dragon Quest Treasures is never short on charm or style, but simple, sub-par combat and loot-hunting mechanics had me scraping the bo…]]></summary>

New Year, new games! Well, not yet, so much.
This week the eShop is a little light, as Nintendo doesn't have a game to highlight: and it even took me a solid 15 minutes to decide which game to feature. I ended up settling on the Humongous Classic Collection, which has six games throughout the Pajama Sam, Freddi Fish, Putt-Putt, and Spry Fox series. Given the amount of kids who grew on those games, it was worth the mention.
The real action begins later this month when Fire Emblem Engage hits the Switch, and catapults us into fairly big first quarter of gaming.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We’re approaching the end of 2022, and we’re concluding the year by going back to our Super Replay roots by tackling an old-school survival horror game. In this case, we’re replaying one of the greatest games of the PS1 era, Silent Hill! Join us live on Twitch today at 2 p.m. Central as we endure two hours of nostalgic, hair-raising scares. If you can’t catch us live, each episode will be available to watch on Saturdays on the Game Informer Shows YouTube channel. 
Episode 1 - The Harry Mason Shuffle
Episode 2- When Doves Cry
Episode 3 - Bible.
Episode 4 - Age Seven, Short, Black Hair
Episode 5 - Map Daddy
Watch on Twitch!
In 1999, Konami put the fear of fog in a generation of players with the release of Silent Hill. The eerie title eschewed the more bombastic horror of its main rival at the time, Resident Evil, in favor of more psychological frights. Protagonist Harry Mason must embark on a terrifying search for his missing daughter, Cheryl, within the eerie town of Silent Hill. What unfolds is a descent into madness that kickstarted a franchise that's (finally) returning to the limelight after years of dormancy. Join me, Marcus Stewart, along with Kyle Hilliard, as we survive Silent Hill’s debut adventure and see how its scares stack up 23 years later.

Granted, my gaming tastes wax and wane over a year, with lengthy JRPG stints rolling inevitably into junk food like Assassin's Creed Valhalla. No matter what, my one constant is an FPS or 'competitive' game, I suppose. Games like Apex, or Warzone, or even Fortnite.
And yet, for whatever reason, I don't consider them as candidates for the Bestest Best games of any year. I might pour hundreds, possibly thousands of hours into them and they won't even make it into my personal list of absolute faves. That's reserved for games, not games.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony released a sneak peek of its upcoming Gran Turismo movie yesterday evening during its CES 2023 press conference, and as expected, it features a lot of fast vehicles. 
Starring David Harbour (Stranger Things), Orlando Bloom (Pirates of the Caribbean, The Lord of the Rings), and David Barnet (Never Have I Ever), and directed by Neil Blomkamp (District 9, Elysium, Chappie), Gran Turismo is based on a true story. That story is about the GT Academy contest, which was a real contest held between 2008 and 2016 by Sony and Nissan. Winners were given entrance into Nissan's Driver Development Program, as noted by Video Games Chronicle. The film appears to be telling the tale of someone who won entrance into this program and then went on to become a real success in the racing world. 
Check out the Gran Turismo sneak peek for yourself below: 


As you can see, this sneak peek is a mix of what appears to be movie footage and behind-the-scenes footage, with stars like Harbour, Barnet, and Bloom talking about their excitement for the film. 
Gran Turismo hits theaters later this year on August 11. 
Alongside this sneak peek, Sony also revealed that Gran Turismo 7, the latest in the long-running series released last year, will be getting an update that makes the game playable on its upcoming PSVR2 platform. 
While waiting to learn more about this Gran Turismo movie, read about Project Leonardo, a new customizable accessibility controller kit PlayStation unveiled yesterday and then read about how the PlayStation 5 has surpassed 30 million units sold.

I had always observed the Fire Emblem series from a distance, worried its strategy gameplay wouldn’t be for me or stressed determining where best to start and how to play through the franchise’s various entries. Fire Emblem Three Houses was the first I gave a good try and 80-plus hours later, it’s one of my favorite games on Switch and turned me into a Fire Emblem fan. Since its reveal, I’ve looked at Fire Emblem Engage as a test bed: am I actually a Fire Emblem fan, or did I just really like Three Houses and its engaging Hogwarts-like school mechanics? If the 10 hours I’ve put into Engage so far are any indication, I’m happy to say it’s the former.

That's less true for ModDB's Mod of the Year Awards, which can shine a light on experiences that may have slipped under your radar.  
This year's publicly voted for crop (as with most year's crops) was heavy on mods for old-school shooters, though mostly not too old-school for me to skip them. Second place was won by impressive S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Call Of Pripyat overhaul Anomaly, while first place went to Half-Life 2 mod Entropy: Zero 2. Check 'em out below, along with the runner ups.

A pseudo prequel is an interesting form for a multiplayer mode to take, especially considering this is the pseudo sequel to My Time At Portia. 
The beta will run from January 12th - January 20th, after which any progress you've made will be wiped.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Last of Us turns 10 years old in June, and Naughty Dog plans to celebrate the milestone with an array of special announcements along the way. One of those updates involves a closer look at the upcoming standalone multiplayer title.
In a blog post, Naughty Dog co-president Neil Druckmann reflects on The Last of Us’ legacy as well as the franchise’s future. In addition to the HBO adaptation premiering on January 15 and the PC port of The Last of Us Part 1 hitting in March, Druckmann states fans will learn more about the long-awaited multiplayer experience that serves as a follow-up to the original game’s Factions mode. Druckmann writes,
“We’ll have some fun surprises for you along the way, but later this year we will begin to offer you some details on our ambitious The Last of Us multiplayer game. With a team led by Vinit Agarwal, Joe Pettinati, and Anthony Newman, the project is shaping up to be a fresh, new experience from our studio, but one rooted in Naughty Dog’s passion for delivering incredible stories, characters, and gameplay.”
Naughty Dog also shares a new piece of concept art, posted in full below, which is the first new material of the game since it released the first concept asset last June. It depicts two survivors heading toward a dilapidated cruise ship. 
Though we’ll be learning more about the game this year, it’s still unknown if Naughty Dog plans to launch it in 2023. That would be fitting given the anniversary, but we'll have to wait and see over the coming months. Until then, be sure to check out this feature on how The Last of Us Part 1 proves there's no such thing as a faithful remake.]]></summary>

Even Vampire Survivors wigged me out because it's so visually busy by the end game, and I was in a more "Ferrero Rocher and jigsaw of the London Underground map" sort of place. My downfall was seeing PowerWash Simulator on sale on Steam. I bought it, and then played it for 40 hours.

        <updated>2023-01-04T13:49:57.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wizards of the Coast, the company behind Dungeons & Dragons and Magic: The Gathering, has reportedly canceled five unannounced games alongside layoffs affecting "fewer than 15 people," according to a new Bloomberg report. 
The people that will lose their jobs will be given a chance to apply for new roles within WotC, but this apparent business restructuring will affect others outside of the company as well. Bloomberg reports that this reorganization will hit Otherside Entertainment and Hidden Path Entertainment, both working on games for WotC, hard. News of this change follows the release of Dungeons & Dragons: Dark Alliance's release last year, which didn't fare too well with critics and players, amidst Larian Studios' continued development on Baldur's Gate 3 (which does not seem to be affected by this reorganization despite WotC serving as the game's publisher). 
These two games, in part, represented WotC's bigger forray into the video game space as Bloomberg reports that the company had signed contracts with several studios to make games. WotC also "built at least six of its own game studios," according to the publication. 
One project in the works that is now canceled went under the codename "Jabberwocky," according to Bloomberg, and two more externally developed games early in development are no longer moving forward as well. These cancelations and layoffs comes as parent company Hasbro's shares fell 40% last year. 
Wotc told IGN that it remains "committed to using digital games as a cornerstone of our strategy for bringing our games to players around the world," adding that it has "made some changes to our long-term portfolio to focus on games which are strategically aligned with developing our existing brands and those which show promise in expanding or engaging our audience in new ways."

Thankfully, one chronicler of modern English culture is brave enough to capture this moment. Yes, absolutely a walrus cracking one off is now in Duke Smoochem, that astonishing upcoming Duke Nukem 3D level made by Dan Douglas.

Roughly 300 QA workers at ZeniMax voted to indicate they wish to join this union, equating to a supermajority vote, and Microsoft has opted to recognize it. This lines up with what Microsoft said last month, where it announced that if these workers vote to unionize, it would voluntarily recognize the union. ZeniMax is the first studio in Microsoft's umbrella of teams to unionize and it's also now the largest group of unionized QA testers at any US-based studio.

With season 2 of Invincible set to premiere on Amazon Prime sometime this year, Fall Guys is whetting fans’ appetite with skins for Mark, Omni-Man, and Atom Eve. The outfits hit the in-game store on January 5, and that hopefully means a release date announcement for the series won't be too far behind.

Fall Guys enjoyed a bit of a renaissance in 2022. In addition to its usual deluge of seasonal content updates, it went free-to-play in May and launched on Xbox and Switch, gaining a larger player base of contestants and renewed interest in general. We look forward to seeing what 2023 brings for the title, but this is a pretty good start.

        <updated>2023-01-03T17:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Polish developer The Astronauts have revealed a new trailer for their upcoming rogue-lite shooter Witchfire. In addition to showing off some new gameplay clips, it announces that the game will use NVIDIA DLSS3 technology, which a press release says will "massively boost performance." You can watch the trailer below.


Announced by NVIDIA last September, DLSS 3 can boost a game's performance by a significant margin. One demo on NVIDIA's site shows two instances of Cyberpunk 2077 running at 96 FPS with ray tracing still enabled. "DLSS 3 allows the seemingly impossible, high framerate without compromising the visuals," Adrian Chmielarz, creative director and co-founder of The Astronauts says in a press release. "A no brainer for a game like Witchfire, which is both action and beauty."
Witchfire is a dark fantasy first-person shooter from the creators of Painkiller, Bulletstorm, and The Vanishing of Ethan Carter. Set in an alternate reality, players are caught in the middle of a war between witches and the Church, and must use weapons and powers from Vatican sorcerers to defeat their enemies. 
The game is set to enter Early Access in the Epic Games Store sometime later this year, though that wasn't always the case. It was delayed last October because the team decided to overhaul the world's design and make it more open. This trailer is a good indication that the studio is still hard at work, though; here's hoping that "early 2023" ends up being as soon as possible.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[New year, new content: Cult of the Lamb is getting a "major content update" sometime in 2023. According to a Twitter thread posted to the official Cult of the Lamb account, this update will introduce features many players have requested, including accessibility improvements, quality-of-life features, new difficulty options, and more depth.
This Major Content Update will release in 2023 and be FREE to all players!
pic.twitter.com/FWFW7sC7F0
December 30, 2022
The biggest change they showcase in this thread is the introduction of heavy attacks, which can be activated by holding down the attack button. These are more than slow swings that do more damage; in Cult of the Lamb, every heavy attack has a unique effect. For example, the sword's heavy attack smashes the ground, doing an explosion of damage that harms any enemy caught in its range. Meanwhile, the dagger creates a line of knives that fall from the sky, and the axe can be thrown around like a boomerang. This is just the tip of the iceberg; developer Massive Monster says it's "just one small tidbit" of what's still to come.
The update should come soon, but not that soon. The last tweet of the thread clarifies that the developers are currently working on a patch to fix some console bugs and that the major update won't be released until after that. Their release window also isn't any more specific than "2023," so it could come out any time this year.
If you're interested in learning more about the game, you can check out our review.

Per VGC, this info comes from a Bethesda support site that went live earlier this month. There are three other questions/answers about the game on the site, but no new info - which isn't weird considering, y’know, the game’s not actually out yet - aside from the message “Starfield arrives exclusively on Xbox Series X|S and PC in the first half of 2023.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[IO Interactive has announced that Hitman 3 will become Hitman World of Assassination later this month and will include all levels from Hitman 1 and Hitman 2 in it for free. 
More specifically, this big update for the Hitman trilogy arrives on January 26 and includes two major changes: 
"Hitman 3 will become 'Hitman World of Assassination,' which will also include access to Hitman 1 and Hitman 2 through our existing Access Pass system. Current Hitman 3 owners will get a free upgrade to Hitman World of Assassination on all platforms."
"We're drastically simplifying the purchase experience for new players. Hitman World of Assassination will be the single experience option to start playing." 


This update makes it so that all Hitman 3 owners will have the same base content ownership, and it attempts to eliminate confusion over which edition to buy to obtain certain levels by making it so that there is only one purchase option. The other DLC will apparently still be available for purchase, but owning all the IO Interactive Hitman trilogy levels will be easier than ever now. 
Hitman World of Assassination will cost $70, and it includes Hitman 3, the Hitman 1 Game of the Year Access Pass, and the Hitman 2 Standard Access Pass. You can also purchase the Hitman World of Assassination Deluxe Pack for $30 to get the Hitman 3 Deluxe Pack, the Hitman 3 Seven Deadly Sins Collection, and the Hitman 2 Expansion Access Pass. 
"Those are the only two products that new players need to consider when buying any Hitman game digitially as of January 26, 2023," IO writes in a blog post. "The changes have also been made with the Freelancer game mode in mind, where being able to easily access all locations from across the World of Assassination is parmount to maximizing your enjoyment." 
In the meantime, read Game Informer's Hitman 3 review and then read about the new Hitman 3 Freelancer mode.

More recently, Squeenix partnered with the “environmentally friendly” blockchain firm Oasys, probably to sidestep potential controversies about, y'know, the environmental impact of the technology.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Starbreeze Studios and publisher Koch Media have released a new teaser trailer that calls 2023 "the year of PayDay 3." Presumably, this means the co-op shooter is still on track to release sometime this year. 
Koch gave PayDay 3 a 2023 release window way back in March of 2021, detailing the game's new publishing deal alongside news that there is at least 18 months of post-launch support planned for the title. Later that year, in June, Koch released a new piece of concept art, citing that PayDay 3 will feature a "fully-fledged social heist universe" set within a Hollywood-like setting. That was the last we saw of PayDay 3 until yesterday, when IGN revealed the "official reveal trailer" for the game, although considering how little is shown in it, it's less of a reveal and more of a teaser. 
Check out this new PayDay 3 trailer below: 


As you can see, there's not much to this trailer other than it calling 2023 "the year of PayDay 3." Here's hoping that holds true.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Starfield, the new and upcoming sci-fi RPG from Skyrim makers Bethesda Softworks, was originally due out in November of 2022, but it was delayed to the first half of 2023 last May. Starfield was then a big part of an Xbox showcase last summer and during that showcase, Microsoft revealed that every game shown would be coming in the first half of 2023. 
Now, a new Bethesda support page for the game has reconfirmed this "first half of 2023" window, as spotted by Klobrille on Twitter.
"Starfield arrives exclusively on Xbox Series X/S and PC in the first half of 2023," the support page reads.
This isn't the biggest surprise; Xbox has discussed this release window for Starfield on two occasions before this support page, but it seems the company is really dedicated to getting it out in the coming months. 
While waiting for an official release date, read about why Bethesda's Starfield delay is key to its new-gen success and then check out this story about how your Starfield character will not have a voice. Read about how Starfield's ambitious scale might be worrisome after that and then read about how Xbox Series X/S first-party games will cost $70 starting this year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I made 12 little games (analog and digital) over the course of my MFA program. However, I dedicated most of that time to my thesis. By graduation, I’d worked as a writer/narrative designer on prototypes, vertical slices, documentation – you name it. And after many adjustments, my thesis even won a highly competitive grant to assist post-grad development! Short deadlines and secondary assignments led to high-stress periods, albeit in a controlled, academic environment, but the lessons about collaboration and creativity were invaluable.
It’s an ordinary school night, and I’m in a video call with my friend Jude. I watch them casually scroll through graffiti-adjacent concept art and brief clips of a passion project called Ponch: Cyberspace Investigator. They give me a rundown of the game’s mechanics, inspirations, and vibe, which includes phrases like “platformer,” “Ace Attorney-inspired dialogue puzzles,” “detective work,” and “hack the internet.” Read more...]]></summary>

That includes a renewed hope that I’ll hear more information about a few exciting games that had little to no presence in 2022.

DokeV
DokeV feels like the “everything” video game, and it almost looks too good to be true. This delightfully colorful title is, among other things, part MMO, part open-world sandbox, part Pokemon, part Ghostbusters, and part llama-riding simulator. Name something that’s fun, and DokeV probably has it. The project has been in the works for at least a couple of years by Pearl Abyss, best known for its popular MMO, Black Desert Online…]]></summary>

It’s hard to say anything about GTA III that hasn’t been said a million times over the last 20 years, but suffice it to say, it laid a blueprint for open-world games so complete that the game industry still largely follows it today.
To celebrate the game’s 20th anniversary, we recently talked to Rockstar North art director Aaron Garbut over email about his time working on GTA III, what it meant for Rockstar as a company, and its overall legacy in 2021. Read more...]]></summary>

There's a small chance you're spending the next several hours at a bacchanalian rager, but I'd bet that you're not. You're more likely enjoying a few hours of peace and quiet after a week with family and wishing Jools would hurry the whole thing along.

That sounds like a perfect time to peruse your gaming library and wonder what you could play. Look at all those games you haven't got round to yet! Maybe 2023 should be the year you really commit to learning Dwarf Fortress, now the Steam version is out. Maybe this is the year you finally give an MMO a try or see your first JRPG to completion. Or maybe this year you're going to uninstall your backlog in its entirety and just accept you're only ever going to play Spelunky from now on.

What are your gaming ambitions for 2023? Tell us in the comments below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As both a parent and the resident news lad here, I probably spend way more time talking and writing about games than getting hundreds of hours to actually play them. While most of the games I've snuck the odd minutes with – I hesitate to say hours – made it onto our Advent Calendar for Horace’s approval, the three below were a few that made me and my family smile at different points throughout 2022. Roll on 2023 - and even more games.


Possibly my most magical Christmas as a kid was in 1997, aged 12. I got a Saturn and an issue of the UK’s Official Sega Saturn Magazine that had a Christmas NiGHTS Into Dreams disc on the cover. I reckon that it was my favourite, most unabashedly fun time for gaming ever (outside my decades fiddling around on PC, obvs). Indie platformer Lunistice is a blatant love letter to the 32-bit era, and the kind of game that largely skipped the poor old Saturn.


You guide Hana the Tanuki about as she dreams, aiming to get her to the Moon. Hana properly speeds along, bouncing and spinning her tail to thwack enemies with a lovely splat effect. Devs A Grumpy Fox have really nailed the classic 90s platformer vibe, thanks to all the different dreamworlds that Hana gets to careen through. Don’t expect something open-world like Sonic Frontiers, because Lunistice is deliberately meant to be a linear, short experience. Good grief, could we use more of those.

We're each powered by a spell that lasts but 12 months, so every Christmas we fall over like sad marionettes. The gnome has to spend a couple of weeks trekking up a mountain to see the fairy who can recast the spells on us. You can help fund his sled dogs and provisions by becoming a member of the RPS supporter program. While he's away, we've prepared some Christmas Crackers for you.

It has been weird to not clock in and just Do News, and to have responsibility only over myself. This freedom has felt great when I've had ideas, and terrible when I've not.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Images of what appears to be a special The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom Switch OLED model have leaked online, but it's currently unclear if this is a real console or a believable fake. 
This news comes by way of Video Games Chronicle, which reports that the images of this console appeared on the Famiiboard forum last night from user Kysen. The user didn't provide many details about the potential special edition Switch, but as you can see in the images below, the photos are quite believable. There are pictures of the console, the packaging, the Joy-Con, and more.
Check out the possible leaked images of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom Switch OLED special edition for yourself below:

December 30, 2022
As you can see, it appears that this model of the Switch is real. However, elaborate and well-done fakes have been done before so there's no telling if this is actually real until we learn more information. It wouldn't be the most surprising thing ever, considering Nintendo tends to release special edition OLED models for big releases like this year's Splatoon 3 and Pokemon Scarlet and Violet. 
The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom hits Switch on May 12 so it might be a while before we learn if this special edition OLED model is real. In the meantime, check out our list of the biggest 2022 games delayed to 2023.

When every year has so many more than 24 good games, I always tried to tactically vote and reshuffle points to wedge in a few wee great games I knew not many people had played. But with a change to voting procedure this year, I simply couldn't get some games on our list. So, here are the games I would've slammed into our advent calendar if I were still allowed to cheat, along with some that simply didn't quite make the cut.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Metal Gear Solid creator and Death Stranding director Hideo Kojima and Metal Gear Solid publisher Konami parted ways with each other back in 2015 and since then, there hasn't been a mainline entry in the famed MGS series (although there was the not-so-great Metal Gear Survive in 2018). 
While there's no reason to believe Kojima and Konami are teaming up again anytime soon, it seems the latter might be preparing for some kind of return to MGS. Longtime MGS producer Noriaki Okamura wrote in a recent issue of Famitsu that "2023 will be a year of many announcements," as reported by Gematsu. 
In this special end-of-the-year issue of Famitsu, multiple Japanese developers and producers wrote quick teases about what 2023 might hold for them. It's here where Okamura teased that 2023 will be a year of announcements for Konami Digital Entertainment. More specifically, he said "Other than [the educational edition of Momotaro Dentetsu announced last year], 2023 will be a year of many announcements," and that his keyword for 2023 is "long-awaited," as noted by Gematsu. 
Now, this could just be his way of saying that Konami, as a whole, will make some announcements and that maybe some of them will be long-awaited by fans. However, given that it's Okamura – a longtime MGS producer – saying this, there's reason to believe that maybe he's teasing a return to the MGS series. Perhaps we're getting a remake of one of the games, or maybe a new mainline entry. Only time will tell. 
In the meantime, read Game Informer's ranking of the Metal Gear Solid series.

We're each powered by a spell that lasts but 12 months, so every Christmas we fall over like sad marionettes. The gnome has to spend a couple of weeks trekking up a mountain to see the fairy who can recast the spells on us. You can help fund his sled dogs and provisions by becoming a member of the RPS supporter program. While he's away, we've prepared some Christmas Crackers for you.

Arc Raiders was set to be the debut title from Embark Studios, a team of ex-DICE talent led by former EA head Patrick Söderlund. The co-op shooter about fighting off robots from space made a splash during last year's Game Awards. In a surprising twist, however, Embark announced months later it was delaying Arc Raiders to next year to focus on launching another shooter pro…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[AMD's Ryzen 5600X was a favourite of value-oriented gamers when it debuted in late 2020 - to say nothing of RPS head big honcho Katharine - so unsurprisingly AMD followed it up with an even cheaper model, the 5600, about a year later. This non-X variant performs more or less identically, with a slightly low rated boost clock that translates into one or two percent worse performance in CPU-limited scenarios. Given the fact that the 5600 is £13 cheaper on Amazon right now, we'd recommend it over the X any time.

Sabrent has discounted the drive to £77.99 on Amazon UK, which is a good price for this level of performance.

Courtesy of IGN, the new video shows that S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 is looking pretty darn good. The narrative-driven shooter is set in the Chornobyl Exclusion Zone in a post-apocalyptic world laden with dangerous mutated monsters. Players must fight their way to the heart of the zone while steering the non-linear plot through choice-driven gameplay. 


Formally confirmed in 2020 after years of start and stop announcements, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 has had a tumultuous development. After announcing and quickly canceling NFT plans due to fan backlash in December 2021, the project came to a screeching halt in February due to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, where GSC is based. Many employees were forced to evacuate their homes in Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital. Other designers chose to defend the city. One of GSC’s designers who volunteered to fight, Vladimir "Fresh" Yezhov, was recently killed in combat. 
S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl is slated to arrive on Xbox Series X/S (including Game Pass) and PC in 2023. It was one of the many titles to get bitten by the delay bug and pushed into next year, a list you can check out here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On February 25, 2022 Valve quietly premiered a trailer for a game called Aperture Desk Job. The video intentionally didn’t explain what the game was, but beyond including the word Aperture in the title, it was clear it took place in the Portal universe. The end of the trailer revealed it would be releasing only a few days later, and it would be free.


As promised, the game released on March 1 and it feels like nobody played it, which is a shame because it is a fantastic, “Playable Short,” as Valve refers to it.
Aperture Desk Job doesn’t have portals in it, but it is a Portal game. It features an established Portal character, as well as a new character named Grady, voiced by one of my favorite comedians (and maybe yours after you watch the clip below), Nate Bargatze.

The mod outfits the Tarnished in the significantly less protective garb of Pokémon trainers, who cruise the dangerous landscape atop the motorcycle-like Koraidon. The video highlights how Elden Ring would be an even better game if it had Lechonks and Quaxlys roaming about, though that doesn't make it any less dangerous, as evidenced by one particuarly brutal Pokémon ambush. Check out the video by clicking the embedded tweet below.

December 28, 2022
It’s unclear if this mod will be publicly available to download or if this video is only a proof-of-concept showcase. We’ve reached out to Arestame for clarification and will update this story if we receive a response.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's a well-documented fact here at RPS that I love a good spreadsheet. Specifically, my spreadsheet that lists all the lovely games I manage to play each year. I've been looking at that spreadsheet a lot in recent weeks, and I'm pleased to report that most of my top game picks from this year have successfully made their way into the RPS Advent Calendar. There were plenty that didn't, of course (pouring one out for you, Dorfromantik, Flat Eye, Dome Keeper and Lost In Play), but such is the way of things when your current list of completed games for the year is teetering on the verge of 50. 
No word of a lie, I would probably be here all day if I laid out my entire long list of honourable mentions for 2022 (additional shoutouts to Railbound, Cursed To Golf, God Of War, Weird West, Jack Move, Hard West 2 and The Kids We Were), but for the sake of all involved (and poor Alice Bee's editing pencil), I've narrowed it down to a shortlist of three. (Do still go and check out those other games, though. They're all absolutely rad).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sequels are often contentious, but I feel like video games can get away with being a part of a long-running series – and, crucially, still be good while they’re at it, well past the point where a book or movie franchise would have outstayed its welcome.
The thing is, though, when it comes to GOTY lists like our Advent Calendar, it’s a much bigger task to convince your fellow voters of the merits of your new favourite game when it’s the third, fourth, or maybe even sixteenth in its series. I’m adamant that those games deserve their share of recognition at the end of the year, which is why my honourable mentions celebrate 2022’s new entries into some of my favourite ongoing series.

I did, however, play a few hours with both Dani and Ryan, two very different survivors that add their own flair to the story of this zomb-pocalypse. 
I came out of this cover story trip convinced Dani is the survivor for me, but Ryan is great, too. And there are still the other four survivors I didn't get to play. Nonetheless, I want to tell you about Ryan, and Dambuster Studios does, too (read about Dani here)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Each mainline entry of the Street Fighter series is an important milestone in the fighting game genre. Though every numbered entry received critical acclaim, Street Fighter V sticks out among fans as the outlier of the series; the game experienced perhaps the most tumultuous launch of any Street Fighter game to date. But out of that trouble emerged something great. Thanks to the team’s persistence, post-launch roadmap, and an injection of new blood into the project's leadership, Street Fighter V drastically improved its core gameplay, online play, content offerings, and more throughout its six-year lifespan.
With the benefit of those lessons learned, many team members that righted the ship are back to develop Street Fighter 6. The latest entry delivers myriad improvements, new features, and a sleek new aesthetic while simultaneously acknowledging and paying homage to each entry before it. Street Fighter 6 feels like yet another evolution of the fighting game genre ushered in by the franchise that pioneered it in the first place. Read more...]]></summary>

After more than 150 hours roaming the Lands Between, I feel the familiar bittersweetness that occurs anytime I finish a game I love. I’d conquered unimaginable horrors and become Elden Lord in my own personalized adventure, all while cruising atop a cool double-jumping steed; now what? Recovering from this high would become a personal struggle for the remainder of the year.
Elden Ring dominated my life. When I wasn’t playing it, it was the only thing I wanted to do. When I chipped away at other games for work or pleasure, tasks like gaining access to Raya Lucaria Academy or conquering Malenia were in the back of my mind.

PlayStation has not announced the new titles coming to the Extra and Premium tiers, but says that they'll be "announced soon." You can read the full blog post here.
Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order is a notable inclusion because its sequel, Jedi: Survivor, is set to come out in March. This PS Plus offering is an ideal opportunity for players to check out the first before visiting the second. If you played the game at launch, this is also a chance to check out the updates that introduced upgraded graphics and performance for PS5, as well as updates that added New Journey+ and challenge modes. You can read our original review here.
This is also a friendly reminder to claim December's PS Plus titles: Divine Knockout, Biomutant, and Mass Effect: Legendary Edition. They'll all be available until January 3, the day the new games are added, so be sure to grab them before that.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been looking back over an entire year of RPS reviews and, well, we've written a lot. Over the past twelve months, the RPS treehouse and our merry band of freelancers have reviewed 168 games in total - and that includes early access reviews, PC-port reviews, group reviews, reviews-in-progresses, and your common or garden fully-fledged reviews. 168! Damn. Even though game releases are still suffering from pandemic pushbacks, 2022 has been a busy year for games. There wasn't a huge number of big name releases - although the ones that did come out were plenty big enough - but, as always, we've had a wealth of wonderful indies releasing all year round, and we scooped up as many of them as we could.
Out of all the games we’ve given any kind of review treatment throughout the year, only a handful of them recieved RPS’s coveted Bestest Best badge; just 23, to be exact. I've gathered them all in one big round-up bundle below (there are round-ups of our favourite bits from other sections of the site, too), and they make a great collection of games. Have a scroll and click on any that take your fancy for the full review. Enjoy!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mortal Kombat was not supposed to die. Many regard Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe as one of the lowest points of the series. Its minigame-centric fights and awkward movement were damning, but it also lacked the silly, over-the-top violence Mortal Kombat is known for – a sad reality for appeasing license holder Warner Bros. Batman can cripple impoverished criminals, but he can’t be cut in half by Tarkatan blades.
It would have been disappointing to end on an ill-fated crossover, but Midway’s untimely demise could have made that so. Layoffs, uncertainty, and publisher implosion aren’t how franchises live; it’s how they die. But the then-newly formed NetherRealm Studios reinvigorated the entire franchise after its darkest period with one of its most beloved entries: the 2011 reboot, Mortal Kombat 9. Read more...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am, admittedly, new to the world of Final Fantasy VII. I have vague memories of seeing a TV commercial for the original PlayStation game when I was young and remember playing the game’s first few hours in a friend’s attic between Mat Hoffman’s Pro BMX sessions. It wasn’t until much later, when I found an inexpensive green label copy at a Circuit City, that I gave it another shot, but, again, I only made it through the first few hours. When Square Enix released it in such a way that I could play it on my PlayStation 3 and move it over to my PSP, I made it the furthest. I left Midgar, saved my game, and turned off my PSP, fully lying to myself that I would pick it back up again soon. That was more than 10 years ago.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you walked into an arcade in the 1990s, it undoubtedly had a Street Fighter II cabinet. If you went at the right time, you probably even saw a crowd gathered around it. As one of the most profitable games in arcade history, Street Fighter II drew more than its fair share of quarters and tokens during the arcade heyday. But the franchise transcends that one moment in time. To say that Street Fighter has sparked multiple revolutions in its genre throughout its history is not far-fetched.
Arcades aren’t omnipresent the way they once were, but the Street Fighter name has endured the ever-shifting grounds of the games industry. The fierce fistfights made the leap from mall game rooms to the living room, the internet, and even tournaments broadcast to massive, international audiences. As the franchise turns 35 years old, we met with the people involved to understand the series’ origins and how it remains relevant three-and-a-half decades later. Read more...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft’s road to acquire Activision Blizzard has been a rocky one, to say the least. The most recent (and significant) roadblock comes from the American Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which filed a lawsuit a few weeks ago to prevent the deal from going through. Now, Microsoft has fired back with a response, saying the FTC is violating their fifth amendment rights to due process. 
The full document (which you can read here) claims that the deal should be allowed to go through for several other reasons as well, stating that Xbox and Activision Blizzard are “just two of hundreds of game publishers.” The claims that the FTC violates the constitution are listed on page 34 and are just a handful of defenses against the lawsuit in a list of two dozen.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The story of Cuphead is indie gaming legend. Brothers Chad and Jared Moldenhauer worked for years, risking their finances founding Studio MDHR and hiring a host of talented artists and animators to bring their tough-as-nails run ‘n’ gun game to life. The gamble paid off in spades. Inspired by both 1930s animation and classic games like Contra and Gunstar Heroes, Cuphead has sold more than six million copies, amassing critical acclaim, legions of fans, a TV show, and multiple world records along the way.
With Cuphead’s staggering success, it’s not too surprising the team at MDHR wanted to deliver one more serving of sharp shooting excitement and aggravation. Opting for DLC as opposed to a full-on sequel, the Cuphead developer set about outlining The Delicious Last Course, released in June 2022. Early in production, MDHR decided that a boss concept from the original game, one scrapped due to time constraints, would be the perfect starting point for this newest outing.

I joined team Arpus all the way back in February, and to say the last 11 months have been a whirlwind is a bit of an understatement. In less than a year I’ve made just under 90 videos covering a wide range of topics from major releases to international gaming events and brand-new hardware. My first year at RPS has been busy, basically. So when Katharine asked me to pull together a few of my personal highlights, I was kind of stumped. It's hard to pick favourites! It's even harder to celebrate my own achievements, but that's beside the point.

Out of everything I played this year, these are the avatars of adequacy, the sultans of satisfactory. The prime ministers of pretty good. 
I’d probably also tip a hat to Warhammer 40K: Darktide, but Alice0 already nabbed it for her honourable mentions, and frankly there’s enough shootybang stuff here as it is. But, also: toilet build quality testing, pushing Nazis into cement pits, and more than a hint of 70s funk. Check ‘em out.

You might already be familiar with one, and that's Jacob, the Lenny Kravitz-esque character featured in the re-reveal trailer for Dead Island 2. During my cover story trip, I played roughly seven hours of Dead Island 2, but I didn't go hands-on with Jacob. I did, however, play a few hours with both Dani and Ryan, two very different survivors that add their own flair to the story of this zomb-pocalypse. 
I came out of this cover story trip convinced Dani is the survivor for me, but Ryan was great, too. And there are still the other four survivors I didn't get to play. Nonetheless, I want to tell you about Dani, and Dambuster Studios does, too (read about Ryan here).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Guides work is a very strange beast, and one that we don't talk about as often as we maybe should. By its nature, we here in guidestown can feel a bit isolated from the rest of RPS. Our guides aren't very visible to our regular readers. No one hops onto a website like this and says to themselves, "Well now! I wonder what guides have been written today that I can spend my time reading through!". The vast majority of people who read our guides come straight from a Google search into something specific like "Can I romance Yennefer and Triss at the same time?" (spoiler alert: you can, but it may not end well for you).
Because we operate so much behind the scenes, it's easy to miss some of the amazing stuff that the team did in guidestown this year. It ain't easy, writing a walkthrough or how-to that's useful for the reader while simultaneously appeasing those nebulous and mercurial SEO gods. But 2022 has been a stonkingly good year for guides, and I'd love to take a little bit of time to shine a light on some of the things we're most proud of having achieved this year - and to toast what will hopefully be another smashing year for guides in 2023!

We weren’t planning on blogging between last week and Christmas, but then Sean Hodgins went and made this, and it would be unseasonably churlish of us not to share, especially given how much personal danger he put himself in while developing this project.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Driller aka Space Station Oblivion (in the US), the FIRST supported game of the Freescape engine, is ready for public testing!
Published in 1987 by Incentive Software Limited, this revolutionary new engine allowed players to explore a solid 3D graphic environment with complete freedom of movement for the very first time in videogame history. 
A new threat emerges after humanity abandoned a dying Earth to establish a new home on planet Evath. Evath's moon Mitral has turned into a gigantic gas time bomb. A meteor is also due to impact Mitral in the next several hours. You were chosen to secure each of Mitral's 18 sectors by positioning a drilling rig over the gas pockets in each sector before the meteor strikes.
Solve challenging riddles by relying on geological clues, intuition, or good old trial and error. To survive your mission, find Rubicon crystals to restore energy and destroy (or avoid) the Laser Beacons and Skanners left behind by the Ketars. Good luck!
Our reimplemented engine features graphics using software (TinyGL) or hardware mode (OpenGL) at arbitrary resolution. The initial Driller support is limited to DOS (EGA mode), Amiga and AtariST releases, but we hope to be able to add more soon! Please contact us if you have some other release.
To play any of these supported releases, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are pleased to announce that ScummVM now supports Adibou 2, a popular educational game developed by Coktel Vision in 1996.
Designed for children from 4 to 7 years old, the world of Adibou is warm and full of surprises. It offers an intelligent and appealing introduction to essential knowledge like reading and math.
Whether you have young kids in your family, or are keen on reliving your childhood memories for a while, fetch the latest daily build of ScummVM, your own copy of Adibou 2, and start learning having fun with Adibou, Plop, Robitoc and Kicook!
You must copy the content of your Adibou “Environment” CD into the game directory added to ScummVM. Then, for any Adibou Application you want to add, just copy the content of their CD into a freely named subdirectory of the main game directory.
Only Read/Count 4-5 years, Read/Count 6-7 years applications are supported for now, but we hope Science, Music and English will come soon.
Currently ScummVM is aware of several Adibou versions in French, German and English, let us know if you own any language/version not yet registered. Please also report to the issue tracker any glitch you may encounter.
