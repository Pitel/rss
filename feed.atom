        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[An arcade fighting classic of the '90s is about to return to game centers in Japan. Sega announced an updated version of Virtua Fighter 3tb, which is set to debut on November 28. 


The new arcade iteration is, appropriately enough, titled Virtua Fighter 3tb Online (via Gematsu). On top of updated balancing and new skills, the meat of this version is the addition of online battles. 


Thanks to Virtua Fighter 5: Ultimate Showdown's technology, 3tb Online lets players take on others throughout Japan. Players can also put their names and records on display and edit and view them on the official website with the use of Aime cards. 




What is Virtua Fighter 3tb?


Virtua Fighter fans in Japan got their first crack at Virtua Fighter 3tb when it made its arcade debut back in September 1997, a little over a year after Virtua Fighter 3 launched. Like the Online addition to the new version, the tb in the title is pretty straightforward. It refers to the three-on-three team battle mode that served as the arcade update's default state. 


A flashback to those halcyon arcade days serves as the introduction to the new trailer. The preview also showcases the aforementioned Aime card compatibility before rolling into some of the soundtrack options and flashing through the playable roster, from Akira to Jeffry McWild. 


The whole thing looks like a treat for fans of the earlier entries in Sega's long-running series, but for now, it's a Japan-only delight. There is currently no announcement as to whether Virtua Fighter 3tb will make its way outside of Japan or to home consoles.

In this final feature, we're closing with an opener as Jim explains why the game's first dungeon is one of his all-time faves...

I have mentioned it a few times during this week's anniversary celebration, but I'll say it again just in case you haven't been keeping up with the Ocarinaversary content (tut tut tut): The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time was my introduction to gaming. And what an introduction it was.

Yet while Valve's handheld is great for playing indie games and older AAA titles, there are some circumstances where it's simply not fit for purpose. It isn't really suited for twitchy multiplayer shooters, while glossy ray traced experiences are beyond its capabilities. So if you're after that kind of gaming on the go, a laptop remains ideal, and you can get a great portable gaming device for less than a grand this Black Friday weekend.

Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2 launched on the Switch earlier this month, and in its next patch, it will be making a lot of changes based on community feedback.
In the latest post on the official game website, it's mentioned how version 1.3 will be the team's "largest early gameplay directional adjustment update". The adjustments made are a response to the fact players have "quickly pushed" the mechanics in the game to their absolute limits.

If you were hoping to see Prison Architect make a return in some way or form, you might be in luck. A new rating for Prison Architect 2 has now been spotted on the Korean rating board.

In a famous scripted sequence during which a long, green tentacle busts through a window and drags away a scientist, the scientist and the tentacle would be mis-aligned, making it look like the scientist floated out of the window of his own volition.

Not anymore. After over twenty years, Valve programmer Ben Burbank has fixed the bug - and explained how he did it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There will almost certainly never be an end to the sheer number of things Doom can be ported to, but earrings are a new one. We've already reached the point where Doom was running inside Doom in some weird Inception-style melding (is that a dated reference?). Now, someone has managed to combine the iconic FPS with fashion.


Streamer, "self-taught dev," and Twitter user Alina has posted a short clip of herself wearing a pair of Game Boy-inspired earrings. Only these earrings can be seen playing a dinky version of id Software's classic shooter, Doom.




This came about not long after Alina posted a tweet about how said earrings can actually be programmed to play Tetris on them. Soon after, user @zKassaiAudio set things in motion by predicting that someone would run Doom on the earrings, which is exactly what happened.


Can I get a pair?


Looking at some additional Twitter/X posts, Alina says she's using the Thumby keychain. This is a tiny gaming device from a company called TinyCircuits, which has been designed after the Nintendo Game Boy.


Given that the Thumby is programmable, it's feasible for anyone with coding skills to put a micro version of Doom on there. As for the earrings, they'll need to be bought separately. It might seem like a gimmick, but it'll give you something to play when your phone's out of signal.


As for the game itself, well, Doom officially turns 30 years old next month. That's longer than some people reading this have been alive. It begs the question of how id (and the fans) will be celebrating its legacy. Doom fashion accessories seem like a good start.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Amazon doesn't specifically list this as a Black Friday deal. But it's certainly a bargain that you can take advantage of this Black Friday weekend. AMD's Ryzen 5 5600X processor is available for just either side of half-price, depending on which side of the pond you live on. Regardless, that's a big chunk off one of the best gaming CPUs around.


When Katharine reviewed the 5600X back in 2020, she called it "a stonkingly fast gaming CPU". It's a six-core, twelve thread processor, with each of its Vermeer processors providing speedy single-core performance, making it an ideal CPU for playing both modern multithreaded games, and older single-thread titles. There are of course plenty of faster CPUs around these days, but you'll pay significantly more for those, and it's only prudent to do so if you're looking to get the highest framerates at 1080p. If you're gaming at 4k, then it's your GPU that'll be doing most of the heavy lifting, and your funds are better spent there.


It's also worth noting that the 5600X is highly power efficient, with a TDP of just 65 watts. This makes it both more economical and more environmentally friendly that a lot of CPUs, an important consideration if your energy bills are making you wince.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For the 25th anniversary of Half-Life, Valve not only released a documentary about the iconic FPS, but also sent out a pretty significant update to celebrate. While the Half-Life patch brought with it some bug fixes, there was one that it didn't manage to iron out. Until now, that is.


In a short clip uploaded to Twitter/X by user @VinciusMedeiro6, another update that rolled out recently has fixed an issue with the Blast Pit chapter of the game. Anyone who's familiar with Half-Life will be familiar with this section, and the bug in question concerns an unlucky scientist.




When Gordon Freeman steps into a control room, a giant, tentacled monster crashes through a window and grabs a panicked, lab coat-wearing NPC. Unfortunately, perhaps due to limitations at the time, the boffin is dragged off by the monster, but the off animation makes it seem like he's floating in midair.


Argh! A flying scientist!


This little immersion-breaking hiccup has been part and parcel of Half-Life for the past 25 years. Even the big anniversary update didn't fix it. But now, it seems Valve saw fit to finally give this small (but wholly iconic) cutscene some additional care.


You can see the result in the clip posted above. For a comparison, @VinciusMedeiro6 also uploaded the original. This way, you can really see the difference this little tweak has made to what must have been a terrifying ordeal for the bespectacled scientist.


Since turning a quarter of a century old, Half-Life has enjoyed something of a resurgence, reaching its highest-ever player peak, even without fixing this bug. It sort of cements just how significant the release was (and still is), both in the FPS genre and in gaming in general.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[RAM is rarely the first consideration when upgrading a PC, as it has a much smaller impact on performance compared to a better processor or a spanking new GPU. But you also won't get without far it, and we are slowly heading toward the point where more RAM is preferable. This year brought a scare when Star Wars: Jedi Survivor seemingly needed a minimum 32GB of RAM. Luckily that turned out to be an error in the system requirements, but as the size and detail of video game worlds exerts greater demand on load times, RAM will become more important. And if you want to get ahead of the game(s), you can get 32GB of rock solid ram for less than £50 this Black Friday weekend.

For goodness sake, just eat it. If a meal's worth remembering, then your brain will cling to the memories of those flavours for all they're worth. Anyway, external SSDs have other applications too. The right external drive can be a great place to store games, whether that's big games that you're not playing at the moment, or just as your standard install for smaller, lighter games. If that sounds useful to you, then you can currently get a discount on the best External SSD for gaming this Black Friday.

By slicing off the rarely used numpad keys, a TKL board gives you a little extra room to wiggle your mouse, or actually put a cup of coffee to one side rather than jamming it somewhere between your keyboard and your monitor. The only problem with TKL boards is they tend to be slightly more expensive than their bulkier counterparts, meaning you often end up paying extra money for less keyboard overall. But if you are in the market for a slimmer typing solution, then right now you can get £100 off one of the best TKL keyboards this Black Friday.

Basically, there's no better time to be in the middle of the Mario / RPG Venn diagram right now.

Unfortunately, this is a familiar feeling. My PlayStation Vita watches me from a shelf just above head level whenever I'm at my desk. It hasn't been used in years, and I should probably put it in its pouch to stop it from getting any dustier, but I like looking at it. Hands down, it's one of the most elegant handhelds of all time. 


PlayStation has a stellar track record when it comes to home consoles, but its history with peripherals and portables is a little spottier. Part of the problem seems to be that the company is seemingly incapable of learning from its past mistakes, and I'm afraid I'm beginning to see errors made with the Vita be…]]></summary>

In addition to capturing them and harnessing their abilities in battle, you can also wield realistic firearms and other weapons to blast them apart or, more hilariously, arm your cuddly critters with some serious heat.
“Pokémon with guns” has become the shorthand description of Palworld, but the experience packs in survival mechanics, base-building, a central narrative, and other bells and whistles.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Videogames are full of loops. Often, the loop isn't just a loop in space but a loop of labour, a loop in time. It's a repeated task with a touch of variation from cycle to cycle, typically associated with a character progression system of some kind. The classic one is the town-dungeon loop in an action-RPG such as Diablo 4. You sally forth into the depths with sword and shield, slaughter a bunch of blameless goblins, then orbit triumphantly back to the village square with its 24/7 forge and bustling adventurer's guild. Then off you go, once again, with a Sword +1 and a shield now bearing a Goblin Magnet. There are straightforward equivalents in multiplayer, especially in the wake of Call Of Duty 4: Modern Warfare - sign in, play a few matches, harvest some XP, unlock a new laser sight, equip it, play a few more matches with +5% to your aim.

What is Jusant?


It's unlike anything else, though there are some games worth comparing it to if you're trying to figure out what you're getting yourself into. Much like Journey, Jusant offers a calm yet curiosity-piquing atmosphere, and while you're not always certain where you're going and why, the promise of solving mysteries motivates you to keep moving forward.

Miles Morales is a comic book character created to represent people of color.
Leading up to the 2008 election, which resulted in the United States’ first African American president, Barack Obama, Marvel wanted to "take a good look" at one of their icons to reimagine as African American. A few years later, when an internet campaign pushed Community actor Donald Glover to play Spider-Man, the icon was chosen, and writer Brian Michael Bendis and artist Sara Pichelli created Miles. Every iteration of the character continues this legacy of representation, and Insomniac Games’ Spider-Man 2 is no different.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ultrawide gaming monitors are good for two things: juggling the exploded mosaic of Chrome windows that it takes to be a hardware editor on Black Friday, and making your games look cooler. I’m too busy with the first to do much of the second right now, but you can get into ultrawide gaming for a relative pittance thanks to these Black Friday deals on the HP Omen 34c.

November 21st, 2023 marked the 25th anniversary of The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time's Japanese launch. To celebrate this historic Hyrulean occasion, we are running articles throughout the week dedicated to the game, our memories, and its legacy. Today, we're ranking the titular instrument's choons...

Here's a spicy take for you: The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time is full of incredible music. What? You've never heard an opinion so out there? Well, let us hit you with another one: the tunes that you play on the titular ocarina aren't all that bad either. Bosh. Thank you for coming to our TED Talk.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week on the Electronic Wireless Show podcast we talk all things GTAVI augury, what with the community going bananas for secret GTAVI clues, and Rockstar finally announcing that they'll have a trailer for the next Grand Theft Auto arriving in December. Our predictions are in fact not as outlandish as you might think, although there are gorillas, obviously.


Alongside this we talk about the games we're playing right now (largely Darktide, it turns out), and dish up some recommendations. We also spent like a third of our recording time playing a deranged Age Of Empires 2-themed RPG using an abbreviated D20 system of Nate's devising, but don't worry, I edited it down quite a lot. Apologies for my poor mic quality!

You can listen above, or on on Spotify, iTunes, Stitcher, or Pocket Casts. You can find the RSS feed here, and you can discuss the episode on our Discord channel, which has a dedicated room for podcast chat.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It is admittedly unfair of me, but any time a video game reveals itself as free-to-play, my interest immediately dissipates. Free-to-play games are not universally bad; plenty of brilliant design ideas, engaging stories, and fun mechanics can be found in games with no upfront admission fee. But once a game’s goal shifts from singular experience to long-term engagement, any excitement I may have folds in on itself and disappears like Pac-Man.
It all stems from my desire for experiences, not obligations.
In free-to-play and comparable models, success is marked by player engagement. The more rounds a player queues into and the longer they play, the more likely they are to engage with the monetized elements. And the best way to encourage that engagement is to incentivize players to return. Dai…]]></summary>

Black Friday now provides the chance to grab one for even less, with good-quality partner cards having fallen as low as £550 in the UK and $515 in the US.

Updated with Disney Illusion Island, 9 Years of Shadows, and Worldless. Enjoy!

The word 'Metroidvania' might rub some core gamers the wrong way, but it's a useful catch-all to describe a very specific type of game experience. Combining elements from both the Metroid series and Koji Igarashi-produced Castlevania titles, this broad platforming genre has you using an ever-growing skill set to open up new paths across an expansive, layered map. As you explore and find secrets throughout the environment, these games empower the player in a way that makes them extremely addictive.

No time like the present, then, to net yourself a top-quality storage extender for your Steam Deck or Steam Deck OLED.


It is of course possible to swap out the Deck’s internal SSD for something bigger, and if it were a desktop PC, normally that would be the way to go. But replacing components in a tightly-designed, hyper-compacted machine like Valve’s handheld is a far trickier business, and just doesn’t have the same appeal when a fast microSD like the Pro Plus is right there. Now, you can get plenty of extra space, an incomparably easier "installation," and performance that still comes remarkably close to NVMe SSD level, all for up to £38 off.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On Thanksgiving, it was announced that over 20 million players have played DON'T NOD's Life is Strange. 


Originally released in 2015 in an episodic form, Life is Strange follows Max Caulfield as she discovers she has the ability to turn back time. At first, it seems like she has just what she needs to fix all her problems and help her friends. Soon enough, she discovers that all actions have consequences, and using her powers comes with a cost. 


The game earned itself a cult following thanks to its realistic depiction of teen life and the complex but beautiful relationship between Max and her rebellious friend Chloe Price. It spawned several titles, including the prequel Before the Storm which centers on Chloe. 




There've been several Life is Strange titles since 2015 but none of them have managed to replicate the magic of the first game. The latest title, True Colors, was released in 2021 and tells the story of Alex Chen the empath. It's worth a playthrough thanks to its marvelous use of music. You also get to explore Haven Springs which is a small town with a lot of heart. 


If you want to experience Max and Chloe's story again, or you're new to the franchise, there is a Remastered Collection available which contains Life is Strange and Before the Storm.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Massive Monster has announced that the next major free update for 2022’s Cult of the Lamb will be coming early next year. It’s Sins of the Flesh, and that’s it. That’s all we know so far.




I hate it when this happens, because I feel like it’s important to let everyone know that this update is soon to exist, but I also don’t have many details to share. They’re teasing that it’s “new features, stories, and more!” We can speculate, so let’s do that.


Hmm. The animals in the key art that was shared are all in the buff. Their alleged special bits are obscured by leaves, and there’s some weird one-eyed tentacle thing in the middle. That’s pretty suggestive. It’s also called Sins of the Flesh, which usually refers to the horizontal hustle. Lust. Trading genetics. If you don’t know what I’m talking about, ask your parents.


So, I’m guessing – and this is pure speculation – that you’ll be allowed to take your relationship with your cultists to the next level. Third base. Maybe home plate. Maybe beyond (to the dugout?)


Yep. That must be it. Sins of the Flesh is the nude patch we’ve all been waiting for. The “not rated by the ESRB” update. Because, I mean, what else are cults for? We’ve already got some doomsday stuff rolling around in the base version. The only thing cults are good for, aside from tax evasion, is some questionable sex stuff. This is exactly the sort of DLC that my cult, The Eye of Buttoxx, has been waiting for.

Cult of the Lamb is available for PC, Switch, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S. The Sins of the Flesh update is scheduled for early next year.

One of the most notable features is how RGG rethought its classic brawler combat. Protagonist Kazuma Kiryu now has two fighting stances, Yakuza and Agent, the latter of which comes with a host of new secret-agent tools, such as an exploding cigarette, a Spider-Man-like cable he can use to whip enemies around, and so on. 
We recently had a chat with RGG series chief producer Hiroyuki Sakamoto – who we spoke with last year about the future of the studio – to learn how Gaiden's new combat together, maintaining the series' identity despite how much has changed over the years, and why RGG doesn't look to…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cheap graphics cards are practically mythical these days, which is great news for gaming obsessed unicorns and centaurs, less so for us mere mortals trapped in boring old reality. But there is one last torchbearer of the budget GPU, and weirdly enough that's Intel. If you happen to live in the US, then you can get your hands on the best cheap 1080p  graphics card for a smidge more than $200 for Black Friday.


Now I know the idea of Intel making graphics cards sounds almost as preposterous as horses with horns, but they've been at it for a while. Granted, they've not been especially good at it for most of that time. The original launch of the Arc series was pretty disappointing. But Intel have worked to imrprove the performance of their GPUs, and now the Arc A750 is an excellent 1080p offering.


It's also a perfectly acceptable card for those looking to make their first-steps into the world of Ray-tracing. As James notes in his review "if you’re specifically looking to try ray tracing on the cheap, know that the Arc A750 turns the tables on the RX 6650 XT with these kinds of settings. Where the A750 produced 47fps in Hitman, the RX 6650 XT could only manage 29fps, an even steeper drop from its respective rasterised performance."

Charles Harte talks about Chants of Sennaar, a puzzle game about language, and Kyle Hilliard talks about Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name, a game about beating up people on the streets of a fictional Japanese city. Kyle also touches on Assassin's Creed VR before the duo moves on to the main course: ranking fictional video game birds on criteria like how tasty do they look and how bad would we feel about eating them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ah, Thanksgiving. It's a time of year for gratitude, togetherness, repeatedly attempting to explain my job to older relatives, and most importantly, a time when a lot of people come together to eat one really big bird. But here's the thing. Why do we always eat the same kind of bird? I mean, turkey is fine and all, but why not branch out a bit? Why not chicken, or quail, or pheasant?
And that got me thinking – why limit my daydreaming to real-life birds when there's so much delicious-looking poultry in video games? Sure, not every video game bird would be tasty, but it's worth assessing in case I ever get Jumanji-ed into a game one day.
Here's my rating of video game birds based on how good they'd be for Thanksgiving dinner.

There’s a small handful of 13th-gen chips at good prices, but nothing on par with the AMD Ryzen 7 5800X or Ryzen 7800X3D that Will highlighted earlier this week.


I have, however, spotted a surprise £20 discount on the Intel Core i7-14700K, which just happens to be the only CPU in the new 14th-gen lineup that actually is worth buying. And so, just as it carried the Raptor Lake Refresh launch, so too must it redeem Intel’s Black Friday showing.

At least, that's what I think.
I find all this nostalgia stuff interesting, mainly because it's coincided with three other events in my own personal timeline (Chapter 29 Season 11, you could say): A League Of Legends pro-player called Faker, the resurgence of a badminton star, and Fortnite's own OG event. The thing that separates them all from COD? A plan.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Omocat's 2020 role-playing game Omori is making the leap to the page with the announcement that a manga adaptation is in the works. 


The reveal came from the game's official Twitter account, which shared an illustration by Nui Konoito, who will be handling the art. According to the tweet, the Omori manga will be serialized in Kodansha's Monthly Afternoon, a seinen magazine that currently runs series like Land of the Lustrous, Heavenly Delusion, and Vinland Saga. It adds that "the manga will be made for both longtime fans of the game and for a new audience experiencing the story for the first time." 




The Monthly Afternoon Twitter describes Konoito as a "talented up-and-coming artist." 


Full of heavy themes, Omori was met with acclaim when it launched on Steam. The Japanese release followed in 2021, and Omori has since made its way to PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch. The game's story centers on a teenage shut-in and his alter-ego, Omori, and features multiple possible endings. Omori has its ups and downs, and the story and the balance it shares with gameplay won't be for everyone, but when it clicks, it really clicks. 


It's unclear just how close the manga will stick to the story of the game. The art style is certainly suited for manga, and the subject matter is a nice fit for a magazine like Monthly Afternoon. As for when, a start date hasn't been listed for the serialization yet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's such a shame Back 4 Blood couldn't quite scratch that Left 4 Dead itch. It was, after all, supposed to be a spiritual successor to Valve's iconic zombie co-op series. Sadly, 'twas not to be. However, with the original L4D turning 15 recently, one of the OG developers reflects on the game.


In a recent interview with Game Developer, former Valve creative lead Chet Faliszek waxes lyrical about the development of what would become an absolute classic in the FPS genre. With the idea being in development since 2005, it's interesting to learn that Left 4 Dead originally offered up just the versus campaign.


Image via Valve/Steam.


Fortunately, after playtesting from the team and words from Gabe Newell, some tweaking later led us to the product we know and love today. However, Faliszek admits that the game is pretty unstable:



I don’t think outside people can appreciate how broken the Left 4 Dead engine was but still shipped...It loaded each map two or three times in the background




L̶e̸f̵t̵ ̶4̷ ̶D̴e̸a̸d̸


Faliszek also recalls how he was put in charge of the project, adding that "no one ever told me I'm running it." 


As many of you already know, Left 4 Dead was originally going to be an offshoot of Counter-Strike (called Terror) before it became its own thing. What I do like is that it was ex-Valve writer Marc Laidlaw who thought to change it from "for" to "4."


To get a bit gooey about the past myself, I have very fond memories of playing the game on Xbox 360 during my time at university. Ah, to be young and full of scrumpy cider at 3AM. Such heady days.


Anyway, it's sad that we've yet to receive a Left 4 Dead 3. Or any threequel from Valve, really. But the original lives on. I almost feel like redownloading it and rekindling those innocent years. Oh god, I'm getting ever so old.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While Bungie may well be going through a rough patch over the past couple of months, Destiny 2's Season of the Witch has proven to be quite good in the end. Now, with Season 23 about to release on November 28, Bungie's revealed more details about its Seasonal Artifact.


Notably, the latest Destiny 2 weekly blog goes in-depth on the Queensfoil Censer: a mysterious Ahamkara-borne object that's going to infuse Guardians with power over the course of the Season of the Wish. Players can expect a focus on Solar, Strand, and Stasis abilities and buffs, as well as an affinity for rocket launcher weapons, allowing for powerful combinations both expected and not.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's a whole slew of big changes coming to Destiny 2 with the release of the Season of the Wish on November 28. Aside from getting rid of Legendary Shards, for example, Bungie is also about to finally push out the working version of the long-awaited Fireteam Finder.


According to Bungie's latest in-depth feature overview blog for Destiny 2, Guardians will have access to a work-in-progress version of an actual, honest-to-goodness in-game LFG (looking for game) system, after close to a decade of relying on external services to find Fireteams. The aptly titled Fireteam Finder will, supposedly, scale to "millions of players" and allow them to quickly and easily find a playgroup for any type of Destiny 2 content, from regular Vanguard Strikes all the way to Raids and Dungeons.

Developed by Polish team Frozen Way, whose other projects include, erm, Hairdresser Simulator, it casts you as Hennessy, a human xenobiologist who is starting afresh on the alien planet of Sota7.
As in Unknown Worlds’ survival sim, you’ll search various biomes for resources, build solar-powered habitats on stilts with nice, wide windows, and gradually amass a database of local animals and plants. Unlike in Subnautica, you won’t be constantly at risk of suffocation.

It might have more entries in it than any other series out there and it won’t be slowing down anytime soon. On top of that, thanks to its anthology-like nature, if one Final Fantasy game doesn’t click for you, there’s a good chance another one will. As a result, ranking the Final Fantasy series can be highly contentious. Everyone has a lot of love for the first entry they played, and then there are heavy hitters like Final Fantasy X and VII, too. 
However, the staff here at Game Informer did the seemingly impossible: we ranked all 19 mainline numbered Final Fantasy games, including their direct sequels, from worst to best. As a reminder, this ranking is the sum of collective thoughts of the Game Informer staff and your own pers…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Both the Steam Deck and Steam Deck OLED come bundled with cases – new and improved ones, if you get a 1TB OLED – so it wouldn’t initially make sense to invest in a third-party one. But Steam Deck accessories can take many forms, and I’ve been particularly convinced by the case style that combines a space-saving protective skin with a tougher removeable cover. Since the Dbrand Project Killswitch isn’t playing Black Friday ball, it falls to my other favourite, JSAUX’s ModCase, to provide the bargains.


It works thusly: instead of taking your Steam Deck in and out of a zip-up sarcophagus every time you want to play it on the move, you simply leave the handheld wrapped in the ModCase’s snug, rubbery skin, simultaneously protecting it and adding grip as you hold it. The front cover simply snaps on and off as needed. It’s a lighter, more compact alternative to a full case that, I can say from experience, absolutely shields the precious Deck effectively enough for everyday bag duty. As the name suggests, it’s modular as well, so you can mount other accessories (like kickstands, power banks and even a secondary cooling fan) to the back of the skin.


Just want the case? No bother, that’s down from $30 from $26. There’s no UK version of the JSAUX store, unfortunately, though JSAUX ships internationally. Just click through the link below, and select which kit you'd like.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The gaming industry has been experiencing a wave of layoffs, and Embracer has been hit particularly hard. In an interview with Game Informer, interim chief strategy officer Phil Rogers spoke a bit about why the layoffs have been occurring and the effect they have had. 


Rogers explains that the business is in a period of restructuring, and this unfortunately comes with a human cost. He states: "it's been an agonizing process to see the sort of headcount [reduction], but we know it's a necessary thing for us to hit our new and needed goals." 


It doesn't seem like the worst is over yet, as Embracer claims it is still in its early stages of restructuring. According to Rogers, we can expect "some more cancellations, potentially some more closures or management buyouts."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know this is the second Crucial P5 Plus deal we’ve posted about in two days, but hey, it’s Black Friday week. ‘Tis the season. Besides, this time there’s something for us Britain-dwelling lot as well, as the 2TB P5 Plus’s price has been slashed 60% to £88 on Amazon UK – the lowest it’s ever been.


This is, to be clear, an almost mystifyingly small amount of money for a 2TB NVMe SSD that’s also capable of real high-end transfer speeds and game load times. Maybe not to the standards of its successor, the Crucial T500, but this is still a competitively quick-acting drive with oodles of space for game installations. The same goes for its heatsink-equipped edition, which also happens to be on sale in the US at $88, making it (currently) cheaper than the non-heatsink 2TB model. Good deals all round, then – told you ‘twas the season.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[No doubt many of you are off seeing family, celebrating Thanksgiving before the Christmas mayhem begins. However, if you are looking to do something while the turkey digests, you can get a copy of Diablo 4 on PC for free right now.


If you head over to Steam, you'll see it's currently available for the princely sum of $0. Of course, this is just a temporary discount, but you do have up to November 28, so you still have a few days left.




However, if your internet is anything like mine (the countryside, amirite?) that might be how long it'll take to download the game. For you see, it's a pretty hefty 84 GB in size. That's still less than Modern Warfare 3's ludicrous 150 GB, but still.


Do you spell it 4 or IV?


After over ten years of waiting for a proper follow-up, Blizzard finally dropped Diablo 4 in June (October for PC). We thought it was pretty great in our review, but others evidently don’t feel the same. Currently, it's showing as "Mixed" on Steam, with a few comments taking note of some rather lackluster gameplay.


On the plus side, we get to temporarily try it for free over the next few days, so even if it isn't fantastic, nothing ventured, nothing gained, yeah? We also recently learned there's an expansion coming in late 2024 called Vessel of Hatred. On top of that, Blizzard is pushing out patches to bring improvements and fixes to the game.


Ooh, look. There's less than three hours to go now until Diablo 4 finishes downloading. Happy Thanksgiving, everyone!

Its main hook? Turn-based battles are filled with WarioWare-style minigames, many of which are unique to the kooky residents or rats you come up against. Unfortunately, I'd say its main hook is actually its most painful barb, and one you're barely able to extract by flicking some switches in the settings menu. A shame then, as exploring its strange world and absorbing its bonkers story beats is a wonderful thing marred by dire fights.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let's get this out of the way first: KnifePlayground: Horror Battle Royale is an absolutely terrible name for game. You might as well call Halo "GunMap: Alien Crowd Control", or Baldur's Gate 3 "TownDungeon: Party Enhancement Simulator". But the project beneath the moniker has something to it. Announced just today and created by small Brazilian team MadMozer, it's a first-person, multiplayer-focussed, Unreal Engine deathgame that traps you in a randomly generated mansion with a bunch of archetypal horror movie munsters - demon clowns, cursed puppets, toothy ghouls and hooded axe-murderers.

That matches its previous all-time low, and to sweeten the deal – in the traditional sense, not the Nate Trying To Make Me Do Horrible Things sense – you can get a £5 ShopTo gift card in the process. To gift to yourself? I believe so. This deal applies to six different DualSense colour options too, from PS5-standard white to a cool blue and a dubiously useful camo pattern.

Up at the top of the GPU pyramid, meanwhile, AMD cards are getting in the act as well. Like, say, this £200-off deal on the MSI Radeon RX 7900 XTX Gaming Trio Classic, bringing it down to £900. Still a lot of money, sure, but the RX 7900 XTX is the absolute crème de la crème of the current Radeon lineup, with native 4K performance on par with that of Nvidia’s RTX 4080.

It's a fast option too, sporting 10Gbps data transfers and rapid charging at up to three amps. In fact, it hits the USB 3.1 Gen 2 standard (what a great naming scheme) and it's a simple, pocketable one metre or 3.3 feet long.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tekken 8 is just around the corner, and Bandai Namco released a glimpse of Leo's glorious combos and eccentric personality in a trailer Wednesday. Their stylish red and white jacket shines as they show off their impressive new counter. 




The German fighter Leo Kliesen is back in Tekken 8 with their Baji Quan fighting style. With their hatred of the main antagonist Kazuya Michima, it makes sense if they make an appearance in the story mode. With the codename "Seeker of Truth," they'd likely join the battle to find out more about their murdered mother and missing father. 


We didn't get many details in Tekken 7 as they were sidetracked by a love-stricken Yoshimitsu, but in Tekken 6, we learned that their mother worked for the Mishima Zaibatsu and G Corporation.


Leo is looking sharp


Not much seems to have changed with Leo's moveset, except for the previously mentioned counter. They'll still stomp their foes' toes and have an elaborate combo set up with their punches and kicks. It's been a few years since I've stepped into the shoes of Leo but one new move seems to be an impactful swirling kick in the air, which is shown in the trailer. 


They also has a new grappling hook that's used for Leo's Rage Art. Perhaps this will be used in combos too, but we haven't seen it implemented yet.


Screenshot via Bandai Namco Entertainment America's YouTube channel


The trailer also shows their adorable carefree personality as they're surprised by the Coffee Queen's name. They stagger back like an anime character as shown in the screenshot above.


We'll be able to play as the German blonde Leo when Tekken 8 releases on January 26, just a few months away. They'll be fighting against many combatants, like the first French fighter in Tekken Victor Chevalier and a mysterious Heihachi-like character named Reina, and the rest of the healthy launch roster for the new Tekken.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in 2021, a PlayStation showcase announced that Aspyr was developing the often-rumored remake of Star Wars: Knights Of The Old Republic. Sadly, that was pretty much the last positive piece of news we got out of that project — up until now. 


In 2022, we learned that parent company Embracer Group had dropped Aspyr as the developer and chosen its own Saber Interactive as the replacement. A studio swap is usually troubling news, but the apparent writing on the wall came only three days ago when Giant Bomb's Jeff Grubb said that “this game is not being worked on right now.”




Luckily, however, it seems like the rumors of the KOTOR remake's death could have been exaggerated. Bloomberg's Jason Schreier has tweeted that while he doesn't know whether or not the game will ever come out, he reports from two sources at Saber Interactive that they are still working on it.




Embracer has yet to comment on the matter, so we still don't know the company's current plans for the remake. When asked about it during a recent Embracer financial presentation, CEO Lars Wingefors declined to provide a comment, saying "I notice anything I say to this becomes a headline, so that is my only comment."


We might not learn much for a while, considering how Embracer is going through a troubled period. Volition was shut down, Free Radical reportedly faces closure, and its layoffs in just one quarter have reached titanic proportions.


The situation sucks, for developers and players. People who've played the original upon release and the many more who got to experience it in the two decades that have since passed would likely love to revisit Knights of the Old Republic in a remake. But whether that will ever actually happen or not remains unclear.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Honor and glory in battle will have to wait, as Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 has been delayed for about a year. 


Publisher Focus Entertainment is holding the release to "properly polish the game." It's the common reason for delays, even though this one is certainly significant. The game was initially poised to drop late this year, but is now scheduled for "the second half of 2024." 


Focus Entertainment won't let next month be without Space Marine goodness, however. It plans to reveal the launch date "in early December" — which may mean some news during The Game Awards. We'll have to wait for December 7 to know for sure.

Space Marine 2 gets delayed, Tyranids rejoice


It would be appropriate for the publisher to reveal the date at TGA 2023, all things considered. The game was revealed during the 2021 Game Awards, delighting fans of the niche hack-and-slash game. It was welcome news. The original Space Marine graced us way back in 2011, during a time when everything was brown. It was brown, like any game of that era, but its intense combat also awarded players with plenty of satisfying red. 


Starring Captain Titus, your job was to tear through Orks with reckless abandon. It was received well and earned itself a cult following over time. Space Marine wasn't a complex game, but the mindless slaughter and spectacle made for a cathartic experience.




The sequel sees Captain Titus return, this time against a new foe. He and his fellows now face the Tyranids, basically giant space cockroaches. Based on what we've seen so far, the gameplay doesn't seem too much different than that of the original. Of course, there's no real reason to add too much and ruin a perfectly good recipe.

As a publisher, Konami doesn't seem to be the most discriminating when it comes to handing their properties to outside developers. However, the fact that Contra: Operation Galuga is being handled by the more reliable WayForward gives reason to be optimistic.


I was given a chance to talk to Operation Galuga’s director, Tomm Hulett. Unfortunately, my optimism has been dashed. My first question was the ever-important “What is the best Contra game?”


Hulett responded, “It's gotta be the NES original. The 16-bit games especially have some amazingly memorable moments, but when you want consistent run 'n' gun perfection, there's no surpassing original Contra (though we are trying, of …]]></summary>

Alongside animation studio Illumination, it had teamed up with Red Wing Shoes to make Mario’s shoes from the movie, not as a line of shoes for sale, but rather a hyper-realistic version of the boots – odd proportions and all – to be displayed at the official Nintendo Store in New York City.

The interest in Mario’s shoes began with the movie’s first teaser poster, where the fidelity of Mario’s footwear blew fans away. People wanted to know more about them, which led Nintendo and Illumination to contact Red Wing Shoes, a Minnesota company specializing in work boots, about making some. “We got the call, and naturally, we’re like, ‘Well, Mario is the world’…]]></summary>

Whether you're playing fast-paced RTS' like StarCraft 2 or twitchy shooters like Apex Legends, a great mouse can be the difference between virtual life and death. And for Black Friday, one of the very best gaming mice is going cheap, rather than squeak.

Another Omen 17 variant, still with an RTX 4080 GPU (but trading an even more powerful Intel chip for less RAM and storage), is also getting the Black Friday treatment in the US. Albeit with a $500 saving, which I understand is not as Big a Number, and is thus less deserving of going in the headline.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Larian Studios has handed an ‘L’ straight to scalpers by affirming that the Baldur’s Gate 3 Deluxe Edition is not limited, and there “won’t be stock scarcity” when it ships in early-2024.




Michael Douse (a.k.a. "Cromwelp"), director of publishing at Larian Studios, said in a post via Twitter that “stock is holding steady,” and that there will be more waves of shipments “being prepared within the Q1 2024 shipping window.” Douse said this to dissuade anyone from buying the Deluxe Edition from online resellers.


“We confirmed a minimum order but we already blitzed past that in the first day, and the Q1 shipping date allows us to simply increase wave sizes without jeapordizing [sic] the shipping date so we expect any issues within that 4 month buffer window,” Douse continued.




This news comes a short time after Larian announced Baldur’s Gate 3 would be receiving a complete on-disc physical version in the form of a Deluxe Edition. For $79.99, players can net a physical copy of Baldur’s Gate 3, plus a bundle of physical merchandise including a mind flayer poster, a deluxe edition box, an original soundtrack, a world map, 32 stickers and 2 patches.


It makes sense that some might assume this Deluxe Edition to be limited given everything included, but now we can say unequivocally that it’s not. So, don’t give the scalpers the validation and buy from Larian directly. What doesn’t make sense is buying something for $160 that is guaranteed to be half that.


Baldur’s Gate 3’s deluxe physical edition is scheduled to ship in Q1 2024, and will be available for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and PC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you are in the mood for a game about dancing around screens full of energy beams and projectiles, searching for that fleeting window of space in which you can stop and perform an attack, I recommend trying the demo for Ninja Issen. If you miss 8 or 16-bit platformers like Shinobi or the original Ninja Gaiden, I also recommend trying the demo for Ninja Issen. If you liked The Messenger - classique Ninja Gaiden's greatest heir - but wished it was More Cyberpunk with cheesy PG-rated holographic dancing girls and Comix Zone-style story panels, I also also recommend trying the demo for Ninja Issen. 


Out today, it's the work of solo Korean dev Asteroid-J, and based on the first level, is pretty decent. It does have quite a lot of dialogue for a ninja platformer, but the dialogue is tongue-in-cheek, and hopefully it'll fall by the wayside as you push beyond the tutorial sections.

It was quite a long list, all things considered, I will probably still end up making another one by the time this year's annual meat snooze rolls around, too. 2023 has arguably been stuffed with even more good games than we had last year, and I will be the first to admit that my eyes are, indeed, frequently too big for what I can feasibly hope to play in any given month.
But I also thought it would also be fun to get ahead of the game slightly by turning some of my remaining supporter posts for the year into a kind of extended I'M SORRY: 2023 Edition series, talking about games I have actually liked and played, but which a) didn't end up making it onto my personal GOTY list (just to keep you Advent Calender guessing gamers on your toes), and b) we also weren't able to review on the site, either due to lack of time, code or, well, no, it's really just time. Time is our eternal enemy. And the first game I'd like to talk about is Tron: Identity.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Subscribers to Nintendo Switch Online's highest tier, the expansion pack, have access to an ever-growing catalog of modern and classic games, including a small library of N64 games. In December, that expansion pack is expanding a little more, as Jet Force Gemini is coming to the service.
First released in 1999, Jet Force Gemini is a third-person shooter developed by Rare, the studio originally known for the Banjo-Kazooie games, but most recently known for Sea of Thieves. It's set on a sci-fi alien world, where players blast through hordes of insect-like creatures.
The most recent way players could experience the game on modern consoles was through Rare Replay, a compilation of classic Rare games released on the Xbox One in 2015.  For a refresher on the game, check out this 60-second rundown Rare put out a few years back.


The Switch Online currently includes 26 other N64 games, including the recently added Excitebike 64. It also includes Game Boy Advance games, Sega Genesis games, and DLC content for popular Switch titles, like Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and Animal Crossing. For the full list, check out our rundown here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We're not far off having our eyeballs exposed to the first official GTA 6 trailer. Until then, let's talk about the classic games in Rockstar's iconic series. Hey, did you know there was a point when Vice City (easily the best entry – I will fight you all) nearly wasn't its own game?


According to a blog post from Obbe Vermeij – former technical director at Rockstar Games – the follow-up to Grand Theft Auto 3 was just going to be a mission pack. Vermeij said the team had the idea to have a game set in the 80s in Miami. But it wasn't until GTA 3 became as successful as it did that a decision was made to turn Vice City into a standalone entry.




The original project was already six months into development, but artists and level designers were "able to get straight onto" the next in-line for the GTA franchise. Despite it being built off the third game's engine, Vermeij remembers VC being "more stressful" than Grand Theft Auto 3.


But wait...there's more


In an earlier blog, we learn that the studio was keen to try something non-GTA. Inspired by the undead, Rockstar wanted to run with the idea of creating a zombie game that would have been built off the Vice City code.


Vermeij describes the elusive project called "Z" (pronounced either "Zed" or "Zee") thus:



The game was to take place on a windswept foggy Scottish island. The player would be under constant attack from zombies. The player would need to use vehicles to get around but vehicles would need fuel. Acquiring the fuel would be a big part of the game.




Sadly, Z was abandoned a month into development as it was "depressing," and the team got to work on San Andreas. Swings and roundabouts, I suppose.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the first ways Fortnite was able to prove its mainstream success was by introducing popular real-world people into the game. Whether it's Travis Scott, Lebron James, or Patrick Mahomes, it's become a sort of Hollywood Star of Fame to be featured in Epic Games' hit shooter. Today. Marshall Mathers joins the club – Eminem is coming to Fortnite. 
The Grammy winner will be added to the game's item shop on November 29. The image above shows the three versions of the rapper that will be available for purchase. From left to right, they're called Rap Boy, Slim Shady, and Marshall Never More. This release comes a few days ahead of Fortnite's Big Bang event, which is set to happen on December 2 at 2 PM Eastern. Alongside whatever world-altering event phenomena Epic plans to introduce, Eminem will be performing a live concert. Attendees will receive the Big Bang loading screen, featured at the head of this article.
Fortnite has been in gaming news a lot recently, thanks to the rollout of Fortnite OG, a record-setting new season that throws players back in time to the earliest maps in the game. It's also come under fire for new rules about which skins are allowed in certain creator-made worlds: you can see their response to this controversy here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Oh, it's been a trying time for developers, especially those who've been hurt by Unity's recent new controversial fees. As a result, many have been hightailing it outta there, looking for alternatives. In the midst of all this, one company has decided to engage in some savvy business acumen.


GameMaker has decided to go in the opposite direction and make itself free. A recent post on the company's website is celebrating Thanksgiving by offering a free-to-use license for non-commercial purposes. On top of this, there's also a new "one-time fee" for a commercial license, replacing its Creator/Indie subscriptions, while Enterprise remains the same.




While it can't be assumed that this is in direct response to Unity's "Runtime Fee," GameMaker head Russell Kay says the team has seen "other platforms making awkward moves with their pricing and terms," so saw fit to go in the other direction. Mum's the word, Kay. Mum's the word.


If you haven't heard of it, you soon will


Offering support for all kinds of platforms, including Android, iOS, Amazon TV, Raspberry Pi, as well as Windows and modern consoles, GameMaker is one more alternative for developers to use.


If you've ever played Hotline Miami or Undertale (or both), then you've played a GameMaker title before. And with free usage for non-commercial endeavors being offered, there's probably going to be a few more people eager to jump ship.


As for what's going on with Unity at the moment, alongside the carnage it's created, the company may also be laying off staff. You know, that thing that's been a plague on the industry this year and is almost certainly going to make people dislike Unity even more? Yeah, that thing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Doom always takes the crown, but that doesn't detract from Wolfenstein 3D's influence as a key part of FPS history. The series is still going to this day (maybe not as strong in some cases), and people are continuing to modify the OG 1992 release.


For example, "Blazkowicz's Text Adventure 3D" is a different take on Wolfenstine 3D. Created by user TryHardWolfers, it essentially turns the game into a text adventure. By that, I don't mean it converts the shooter into prose, dialogue, and reams of exposition. Rather, what it does is replace every single texture with a word.


Image via TryHardWolfers/ModDB.


Walls are simply described as "BRICK WALLS," hanging lights are dubbed "LAMPS," and the machine gun you carry...well, you get the idea. There's even a screenshot showing that the picture of Adolf Hitler has been changed into words. You can download the mod from ModDB.


It's a wordy one


 As TryHardWolfers says, this "text tale is filled to the brim with well-worded action and tense text map design." It's almost as if we've come full circle, taking the immediacy and immersion of a 3D rendered environment and broken it down into a text adventure of ye olden days.


With Wolfenstein 3 said to be in development, there's seemingly no stopping B.J. Blazkowicz and his Nazi-killing antics. With the first game in the series releasing all the way back in 1981 (developed by Muse Software, 11 years before id's 3D take on it), battling against the Third Reich is evidently something that just doesn't go out of style.

As big a packrat as I am, I cannot and would not disagree with this outcome. We also switched to a new poll system and that seems to be working for more folks, so that's grand.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Xmas season approaches, but for some of us, Halloween never ends. I've just finished (well, reached a grisly end within) the demo for Chiyo, a first-person horror game from Nimbus Games, set in Edo era Japan, in which you are a plucky young mystic sent by the Tokugawa Shogunate's Magical Arcane Division to investigate and cleanse a spooky abandoned mansion on the coast. 


Much like the protagonist of fellow Japan-set exor-simulator Ghostwire: Tokyo, you have a brace of occult, gesture-based powers with which to explore and, hopefully, vanquish any lurking spirits, but so far, the only ones I've gotten access to are a funky finger torch, the ability to unseal cursed doors, and the ability to see glowing puzzle props through surfaces. I very much do not feel like an Edo era John Constantine. I don't even feel like an Edo era Scooby Doo. I mean, at least he was good at running away: the titular Chiyo waddles about like she's worried her trousers are about to fall down.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Celebrate the festive season Remedy style with Saga Anderson's cozy sweater. With the studio's knitting guide, you'll have a sweater of your own in no time. 


The guide is adequately detailed, giving you charts for each of the patterns on the sweater, as well as measurements and different yarn colors. Remedy has described the sweater as "distinctly Nordic." 


If you want to really nail Saga's look, you can also follow Remedy's cosplay guide. It covers all the details you might need including her hairstyle, gun holster, and stylish FBI jacket. 


Saga is seen in a couple of outfits in Alan Wake 2. She usually wears her FBI jacket, but you also catch her in a blue Oh Deer! sweater. There's also a red jacket available for her if you've purchased the deluxe edition of the game.

Season's greetings from Remedy


It's no surprise to see the guide coming from the Finnish studio, as knitting is a beloved pastime in the country, as well as in other neighboring Nordic countries, including Sweden which is part of Saga's ancestry.


This isn't the first time Remey has attempted to get its fans into the festive spirit. Notably, in 2015, Sam Lake appeared in a somewhat unsettling video wishing players happy holidays while teasing a bit of what was to come in both Quantum Break and, quite interestingly, Alan Wake 2 as well. 




If you do decide to purchase Alan Wake 2's deluxe edition, you'll receive the game's two upcoming DLCs. The first one, Night Springs, is scheduled to arrive in Spring 2024.

The associated Rise of the Dark Fog update is out on 15th December. Youthcat have put together a nifty announcement trailer that makes cunning use of the ability to raze factories from orbit - I'm curious to know if it was actually performed in-game.

It doesn't seem like Miura is bitter about leaving, as his translated Tweet states that he has no regrets, and he thinks Nintendo is an incredible company. Nevertheless, he wouldn't recommend it lightly. Though the company is ideal for geniuses, Miura felt as though he wasn't cut out for the environment. Ultimately, he discovered that he "wasn’t suited for the role," which has given him the confidence to pursue other goals.

This isn't the first time Destiny has seen a crossover with another franchise, but it's certainly among the more high-profile, right along with the previous Sony crossover. That collaboration introduced armor sets inspired by God of War, Horizon Zero Dawn, and Ghost of Tsushima. The next set of Guardian cosmetics adds more armor to your closet, along with a finisher, Ghost shell, ship, Sparrow, and emote.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It appears the next Subnautica game is diving deep sometime in early 2025. It's been roughly two years since fans dove into the chilly waters of the series, and it feels like it's nearly time to strap back into that diving suit once more. And then get eaten by a Reaper Leviathan.


As spotted by RPS, the game's potential launch window came out of a recent financial report by publisher Krafton. Details are sparse and will continue to be so until the company is ready to announce the game proper. It's currently unknown if the next Subnautica in 2025 is set to be a spin-off or sequel, but judging by the development time, it's likely going to be the latter. Of course, that's just speculation. But isn't it fun to imagine?

The next Subnautica game set to terrify in 2025


The next Subnautica has been in the works for some time now. We last heard of it back in April 2022 when developer Unknown Worlds advertised a Senior Narrative Designer position on Twitter. Since then, fans of its signature undersea horror themes have been waiting to know more. If the game is scheduled for a release in the first half of 2025, I wouldn't expect to see any reveal until Summer Game Fest next year at the very earliest. It should at least make for a good addition to a prediction list. 


As noted by RPS, the financial report covered some future Krafton projects. Project Gold Rush is an "Action-Adventure Sandbox" set to launch in the first half of 2025, much like the new Subnautica. The publisher also listed a Dark and Darker mobile game, Project inZOI, and Project Black Budget all under development for 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Star Wars: Empire At War wasn't a great game, but it did fulfill a simple fantasy: it was a real-time strategy game with original trilogy Star Wars units. If what you wanted was to fling swarms of AT-ATs against swarms of X-Wings then, yeah, you could do that. Darth Vader versus entire platoons of rebel soldiers? That too.

Why am I talking about a 2006 RTS? Because it just got a new official patch to make it run in 64-bit and fix a number of bugs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I watched a few hours of Worldless being played last night and didn't really register that it was turn-based. That's because it's a Metroidvania platformer and, when it is time for back-and-forth combat, you're not choosing attacks from a menu. Instead you're stringing together combos in real-time, then when your alotted attack time is over, you're parrying enemy assaults with rhythmic flair. 

So, turn-based, yes, but with a twist. It's also out today.

Few manufacturers understand this better than Logitech, whose G915 Lightspeed Wireless keyboard has been the ideal way to type without tethers for years. It combines a slim yet robust build quality with wonderfully tactile keys, incredibly fast response times, respectable battery life, and a truly standout volume wheel. Perhaps for that reason, the G915 Lightspeed has also maintained its lofty price point, with an RRP of around £220. But as part of Amazon's Black Friday sale, you can currently grab the best wireless keyboard for almost half price. It's currently available for £125 in the UK, and $160 in the US, which is 46% and 36% off respectively.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After four seasons of brand new content, Epic Games injected a healthy dose of nostalgia into Fornite Chapter 4's fifth season, officially called Season OG, by bringing back the Chapter 1 map for players to experience once more. Season OG has included weekly updates to add items from Chapter 1's various seasons, too, making it a fun romp through what Fortnite was like years ago. However, Season OG ends on December 2, which is also when Fortnite's next live event, The Big Bang, goes live. 
The Big Bang begins on Saturday, December 2, at 11 a.m. PT/2 p.m. ET, and Epic says, "This event marks a new beginning for Fortnite." 
✅ Unforgettable event

Before the event begins, Epic says players will see The Big Bang in the Battle Royale tile in the Discover section of Fortnite 30 minutes prior to its start; that way, you can jump in before the event starts to link up with friends and get your cosmetics in order. And speaking of friends, The Big Bang will support parties of up to four players. 
The Big Bang will be available anywhere you play the most current build of Fortnite, including PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC. If you won't be near a dedicated gaming device during the event, you can check it out using Xbox Cloud Gaming, Nvidia GeForce Now, and Amazon Luna services to play Fortnite via cloud streaming on your computer or mobile device. 
"To prepare for The Big Bang, Fortnite experiences made by Epic will be disable starting 12 p.m. ET on December 2," Epic writes in a blog post. "Creator-made experiences will remain enabled until downtime for Fortnite v28.00 starts at 11:30 p.m. ET."
While waiting for The Big Bang event, read up on everything you need to know about Fortnite Chapter 4: Season OG, and then read about how Epic says it's aware it missed the mark with a recent cosmetic restriction update for Fortnite.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Razer have just launched, in a teamup with UK retailer Laptops Direct, one of the more unusual Black Friday deals I’ve seen thus far. In addition to several-hundred-quid savings on various Razer Blade gaming laptops, these also come bundled with a Razer Edge Android tablet and its Kishi V2 Pro controller – a bonus package worth £450 by itself. A free bag, worth £89, is thrown in as well, as is a copy of Alan Wake 2 for selected models. Potentially, then, you could walk away with £579 in freebies, all on top of your savings on the laptop itself. Interesting.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CD Projekt Red released Phantom Liberty, the first and last expansion for its 2020 RPG, Cyberpunk 2077, in September. We loved it – find out why in Game Informer's Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty review here – and if you enjoyed the base game, it's not an expansion to miss. Currently, it's only available for purchase as an add-on to Cyberpunk 2077, but if you haven't yet picked it up, it might be worth waiting just a couple more weeks. That's because CDPR has revealed Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition, which includes the base game and the Phantom Liberty expansion in one single package.
Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on December 5, and will be released in both a digital format and physical. Check out the box art below: 
Big news… Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition arrives on December 5th in digital AND physical form for Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC!
#Cyberpunk2077 story as well as a new spy-thriller adventure in the #PhantomLiberty expansion in one package. 🔥 pic.twitter.com/IOBPCdTXFU
November 21, 2023
All that CDPR has shared about this new edition is the tweet above so it remains to be seen if the Ultimate Edition includes any new goodies or enhancements. Given Phantom Liberty and the Cyberpunk 2077 2.0 update improved the game in big ways, reworking and revamping several of its mechanics in the process, it's unlikely the Ultimate Edition will include any changes in that vein. Only time will tell, though. 
For more, read Game Informer's Cyberpunk 2077 review and then read Game Informer's Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty review. After that, read about the things to remember and know before starting Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty, and then check out this feature about how the team behind the expansion created its spy-thriller soundtrack. Read about this live-action Cyberpunk 2077 project that's now in the works, too.

That's according to former technical director Obbe Vermeij, who joined Rockstar North in 1995 back when it was called DMA Design, and left in 2009 following the release of GTA 4. In the run-up to the GTA 6 trailer reveal next month, he's started blogging about the development of several Rockstar games, from GTA through grotty snuff film simulator Manhunt to cancelled projects such as the zombie title and Cold War stealth fest Agent.

Now, there’s an all-too-rare opportunity to grab one at significantly less than RRP/MSRP, with the triple-fan MSI GeForce RTX 4060 Ti Ventus 3X OC falling to £380 in the UK and $370 in the US.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 developers Sledgehammer Games (umpteenth reminder: that's Modern Warfare 3 as in the 2023 game, not the 2011 FPS of the same name) have hosted a Reddit AMA in which they answered a bunch of questions about the evolution of the game's competitive meta. That's meta as in the overall balance of power between Modern Warfare 3 loadouts, playstyles and so forth based on a variety of factors such as map design, rather than the Alan Wake 2 kind of "meta", where characters talk about how they're just characters in a game and so on. I would dearly like to see some crossover between these types of "meta". I guess the Call of Duty that comes closest to fulfilling that idea is Black Ops 3, with its fourth-wall-breaking cyborg theatrics.


Anyway, the discussion is interesting because it touches on the fact that the evolution of an FPS competitive meta is an artful balance of prediction and reaction, imposing new directions on players at times, taking direction from them at others. The developers want the Modern Warfare 3 meta to change "from season to season" - the question, of course, is how to do this without alienating fans of certain weapons and strategies.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[AMD's Ryzen 5000 series was the zenith of the long-running AM4 platform, a family of CPUs that offered an extreme uptick in performance compared to Ryzen 1000 processsors on the same socket. While the exceptional 5800X3D takes the title of the fastest gaming CPU from this generation, the standard 5800X is another capable performer - and this eight-core, 16-thread CPU is significantly cheaper during Black Friday, costing just £181/$207. 
That's pretty good going for a CPU that cost double that at the start of 2022 - especially when it also costs 60% as much as the Ryzen 7 5800X3D while delivering 75% to 95% of the performance, depending on the game.

The differences are clear but takedown company DMCA Piracy Prevention has trouble distinguishing between the two, which motivated Tumblr's parent company Automattic to add the outfit to its DMCA "Hall of Shame".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yakuza: Like A Dragon was a very silly game in spite of its dramatic narrative, but its follow-up, Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth, looks to give it a run for its money. Between letting Ichiban ride a dolphin and its Animal Crossing-style city-building mode, fans of the franchise’s goofball nature should be in for a treat, and a new batch of screenshots highlight this.
The images provide looks at Ichiban, Kiryu Joryu, and their returning friends, such as Nanba, Adachi, and Saeko, kicking butt in a variety of classes and looking absurd doing so. Other familiar faces will be playable party members for the first time, such as Seonhee, who is shown brutalizing opponents with a whip in the images. It's clear that Hawaii will never be the same once these guys are done with it. 


Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on January 26. You can learn more about the game and see it in action in this pair of trailers. Be sure to also read our review of its direct predecessor, Like A Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name, here.]]></summary>

Other times,  from my incredulous pride after unraveling said problem. But most of all, the experience regularly gave me pause as I pondered a philosophical idea or argument that challenged my viewpoints on the nature of existence and humanity’s place in the cosmos. These moments spurred me to solve the game’s 100+ puzzles in search of answers, and I’m largely satisfied with what I discovered.

        <updated>2023-11-17T15:41:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Final Fantasy VII Rebirth arrives in February, which isn’t too far on the horizon, so Square Enix is getting players prepared with a cinematic refresher of its predecessor, Final Fantasy VII Remake. The company pairs that with a batch of fresh screenshots and art, including the first glimpse of the Highwind airship. 
The video sees Red XIII narrate the broad strokes of the 2020 adventure. While it doesn’t touch on the finer details and background of the characters, it provides a decent summary that's perhaps better served as a reminder for fans who played Remake rather than someone coming into Rebirth completely fresh. Unfortunately, the recap doesn’t touch on the events of the Intermission expansion that introduces Yuffie, who joins the party in Rebirth, so unfamiliar players will have to do their own homework on that. 


Square has released some new images, including a piece of art depicting Aerith in front of the Highwind. The screenshots show off the town of Kalm, the summon Kujata, the abandoned Mythril Mine, and a few side characters. Oh, and Chadley is there too. 

Final Fantasy VII Rebirth launches on February 29 for PlayStation 5. You can watch us play two demos of the game in this video and read our hands-on impressions here. You can also get the answers to some of Rebirth's burning questions in this interview with Square Enix.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Update, 11/20/23:
Last week, developer Epic Games updated Fortnite to include a new rating restriction that applies to certain skins. Depending on a Fortnite skin, it might only be useable on a creative island with a T rating, meaning the Resident Evil Claire Redfield skin, which features a pistol in a holster on her thigh, can't be used on islands rated less than Teen. Players were upset with this change as it made skins they paid real money for (often $10 to $20 per skin) unusable in all the ways they might have previously been usable. 
Epic said only 7 percent of Fortnite skins are only usable on Teen-rated islands, at the time, but it's clear enough skins are affected to have the community unhappy with this update.
Over the weekend, Epic released a statement through the official Fortni…]]></summary>

Back in the '90s, Nintendo played faster and looser with its library of characters. Sometimes Yoshi showed up in The Legend of Zelda, and Kirby was whatever color he felt like at the moment, be it gray or pink. In 1996, that laissez-faire attitude was in full effect for the release of Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars for the Super Nintendo. Link, Samus, and even Donkey Kong (sort of) all had inexplicable cameos in the game, and one of my big questions about the remake was whether or not those would move forward.

Arguably the most interesting secret boss of the original game was Culex. He is not a Final Fantasy character, but he looks and feels like one and features Final Fantasy music and sound effects.
Culex appears in Super Mario RPG remake as he did in the original game, which is to say he is a pixelated, 2D creature. He also features the original throwback soundtrack and sound effects. You access him the same way, too – by buying fireworks and trading them with the little girl nearby in Moletown for a shiny stone. You then use that shiny stone in Monstro Town on the locked door.
However, upon defeat, Culex teases another encounter in the future, which is where thin…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Steam Deck OLED releases today, providing a new avenue for game players (especially those with big Steam libraries) to take their gaming experience on the go. The new OLED models (one at 512 GB and another at 1TB storage) effectively replace the original release as the new Steam Deck flagship hardware. The older 64 GB and 512 GB LCD models are being phased out, while the 256 GB LCD will remain available at a reduced price.
Steam Deck OLED is not a fundamentally new platform. In many ways that matter, our review of the original still stands, and snagging one of the older LCD screen models is now an even more substantial value at the lower price. However, several of the concerns that surfaced in that review have been remedied by the new model – enough that a new evaluation is warranted.

And then, in a bit of a meta twist, we hung out with Humanity co-developer and publisher Enhance and discussed how we made our making-of documentary. Even cooler, we made a Game Informer level within Humanity – and you can play it now.
All this happened on the "HUMANITY Hub Community Stream," where myself (Blake) and Alex Van Aken discussed why we decided to make a documentary on Humanity, how we crafted the video, and even cutting-room floor content that didn't make the final product. We closed the show by putting our collective brains together to make a level based on the GI logo.
You can check out an archived version of the stream below:


By no means is our Humanity level an official partnership between Enhance and GI, but it's certainly a fun way to end a project that was a months-long labor of love.

It released Phantom Liberty, the first and only expansion for Cyberpunk 2077, debuted its soundtrack on streaming services, revealed plans for a live-action Cyberpunk project, and just this week, nabbed four nominations for The Game Awards 2023. Now, CDPR has announced it is working on a mod editor for The Witcher 3 that will hit PC sometime next year for free. 


"We're thrilled to announce that we're working on a mod editor for The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt," a tweet from the official Witcher Twitter account reads.

Notably, CDPR says this mod editor for The Witcher 3 will allow players to create their own experiences in the game, meaning people can develop their own fantasy adventures starring everyone's favorite monster hunter. In a reply on Twitter, the official account confirms this mod editor will only be coming to PC.

The original Super Mario RPG, released for Super Nintendo in 1996, felt like it was meant to be your first RPG. In an era when Final Fantasy tried its best to tell mature stories within the medium's limitations and Dragon Quest demanded hours and hours of your time, Mario’s adventure felt much brighter and more manageable. Familiar characters, a lighthearted story, a reasonable length, and timed button-pressing during combat made it stand out against the competition. Revisiting the game more than 25 years later in this new remade shape shows the original formula did n…]]></summary>

To celebrate the game's reception, director Jiwon Choi released a Director's Letter video earlier this month to tease some images of Lies of P's DLC and reveal details about an upcoming update. That update is now out and it includes free cosmetic items, some bug fixes, and balance changes that should make the game easier.

It says it is doing so to align with "the new competitive market." 505 Games is the publisher behind games like Ghostrunner 2, Control, Payday 2, the PC version of Death Stranding, and more; it's unclear how much of that team will be affected by Digital Bros' overall plan. 
"Digital Bros has reviewed its projects to align with the new competitive environment," it writes in a press release. "This is expected to represent a reduction of approximately 30 percent of the global workforce, but no significant effect of restructuring costs is expected on the annual project results for [Fiscal Year 2024]."

Shantae Advance: Risky Revolution was arguably the most interesting title. Developer WayForward began development on the game 20 years ago, but never completed it. Next year, the game will finally make its way to Switch, but retain the Game Boy Advance aesthetic it was always meant to have.

Persona 5 has become its own sort of mini-franchise within the Persona series. With many spin-off titles released over the years, such as Persona 5 Strikers, Persona 5: Dancing in Starlight, and Persona Q2: New Cinema Labyrinth, Atlus seems to love using Persona 5’s popularity to explore new stories and gameplay ideas. However, I applaud Atlus for making all of these spin-offs in completely different genres from each other. The latest, Persona 5 Tactica, delivers an entertaining story, a colorful cast of charact…]]></summary>

Mustakro on Twitter has taken their enjoyment of the game's boss designs and turned some of Lies of P's toughest challenges into Cuphead-style bosses, and it rules. 


I came across Mustakro this morning, scrolling through my Twitter feed, when I saw a really awesome rendition of Lies of P's King of Puppets boss (one of the most difficult in the game) in the style of Rubberhose, which is that classic animation style popularized in the 1920s seen in Cuphead.

Call of Duty cycles through its lineup of villains on a yearly basis. Sometimes it's Nazis, other times it's Russian nationalists or zombies. But the most dangerous threat is one without a lust for brains or access to weapons of war; it's stagnation. And while many Call of Duty teams often switch up just enough variables to stave off monotony, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III fully submits to the annual churn.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After months of character reveals, Tekken 8 has announced the final fighter of its launch roster: Reina. This brand-new character sports a lightning-quick moveset, earning her the nickname “Purple Lightning," and has mysterious ties to the Mishima clan.
Bandai Namco states that little is known about Reina's history besides she’s a student of the Mishima Polytechnical School. For some reason, she really wants to fight Jin (move over, Hwoarang), and based on her gameplay trailer, she seems more than capable of taking him on. Check Reina out in action below. 


With Reina’s addition, the 32-fighter roster is now complete. Here’s the full list of characters, with new fighters denoted and links to applicable articles/trailers:
Alisa Bosconovitch
Asuka Kazama
Azucena Milagros Ortiz Castillo (New)
Bryan Fury
Claudio Serafino
Devil Jin
Feng Wei

Additionally, the game's first Season of post-launch DLC will add four unannounced fighters. These characters will be released separately each season throughout 2024, with the first arriving sometime in the spring. 
Tekken 8 launches on January 26 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. Check our early hands-on impressions of the game here.]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-11-13T18:37:59.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Amazon is laying off 180 jobs in its games division, hopping on the tragically overcrowded bandwagon of layoffs in the game industry this year. The news comes via Aftermath, which reports that the layoffs are focused in two areas – the Crown Twitch channel, which will reportedly be eliminated altogether, and the game growth teams. Employees were notified of the changes through an email from Christoph Hartman, VP of Amazon Games. This is the second wave of layoffs this division of the company has faced this year.
An excerpt of the announcement email can be read below:
There have been so many layoffs in the gaming industry this year that it's getting hard to keep track of. Last week, we learned Free Radical Design is on the verge of closing down and that Ubisoft laid off more than 100 employees. The week before that, roughly 100 employees were laid off at Destiny 2 developer Bungie. 
In January, Microsoft laid off 10,000 employees amidst its ongoing $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard, which it completed last month. 
In August, Striking Distance Studios, the team behind last year's The Callisto Protocol, laid off more than 30 employees, and that same month, Mass Effect and Dragon Age developer BioWare laid off 50 employees, including long-time studio veterans. The following month, in September, Immortals of Aveum developer Ascendant Studios laid off roughly 45% of its staff. 
Just last month, The Last of Us developer Naughty Dog laid off at least 25 employees, and Telltale Games underwent layoffs as well, although an actual number of laid-off employees has not yet been revealed. And in late October, Dreams developer Media Molecule laid off 20 employees.
The hearts of Game Informer's staff are with the people laid off from Amazon Games, along with everyone else who has lost a job this year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this summer, developer Evening Star Studios and publisher Private Division revealed Penny's Big Breakaway during a Nintendo Direct. While the throwback 3D platforming adventure looked great in its own right, what caught a lot of people's attention was the team behind it. Evening Star's creative director and lead engine architect is Christian Whitehead, one of the lead developers behind 2017's Sonic Mania. Whitehead isn't alone, though, as various other Evening Star developers also worked on Sonic Mania. While we've still got some time before the game's release – it's due out sometime in 2024 – Game Informer has a special sneak peek at its music and can exclusively reveal three tracks from the game.

More specifically, the next Indie World Showcase will air at 9 a.m. PT/Noon ET tomorrow, on November 14. As usual, Nintendo kept the announcement of this showcase light on details – all we know is that it's set to run for roughly 20 minutes with both new announcements and updates to games we already know about. 
A new @IndieWorldNA Showcase is airing tomorrow, Nov. 14 at 9:00 a.m. PT! Tune in for roughly 20 minutes of new announcements and updates on indie games coming to #NintendoSwitch. #IndieWorld

November 13, 2023
As with every Indie World Showcase, the question must be asked: is this the time where we finally see Hollow Knight: Silksong, the Hollow Knight sequel from developer Team Cherry that began life as a DLC to the original game? It probably won't be but it's always fun to get your hopes up a little bit so that they may be gently crushed. 
Tomorrow's Indie World Showcase for Nintendo Switch begins at Noon ET. 
In the meantime, read Game Informer's Hollow Knight review and then check out everything announced during the last Indie World Showcase, which was held in April, for a glance at what to potentially expect with tomorrow's.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Put your sleuthing caps on, detectives—it’s time to solve some mysteries! We are proud to announce that a whole batch of HeR Interactive’s Nancy Drew games are now ready for public testing:
In Nancy Drew: Stay Tuned for Danger, a soap opera star needs your help in uncovering who is behind a series of death threats that sound a little too real for comfort. 
Nancy Drew: Message in a Haunted Mansion has you helping out with repairs in a Victorian mansion. However, a series of strange accidents, plus some murmurings of a ghost haunting, quickly threaten to turn this renovation into an investigation.
In Nancy Drew: Treasure in the Royal Tower a failed ski vacation at an eccentric castle with even more eccentric inhabitants soon turns into a quest to uncover a lost piece of the history of the French Revolution.
And if you’re looking for something more thrilling, in Nancy Drew: The Final Scene, you will find yourself racing against the clock to find your kidnapped friend, while also saving a historical theater with more than a fair share of secrets from demolition.
The games are available for purchase through HeR Interactive’s website or Steam (Stay Tuned for Danger is not available on Steam, however). Or if you already own a CD copy of the games, their English and Russian variants will also work. To play them with ScummVM, you will need a daily development build. As always, if you encounter any issues, please submit a bug report to our issue tracker.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are very pleased to announce today the start of the testing period of two single-game engines: Kingdom: The Far Reaches and Escape From Hell!
Kingdom, was developed and released by Interplay in 1995. Only the DOS version of the game (available on gog.com) is supported. It's a cartoon FMV game, with an inventory, in which you have to guide Lathan Kandor through a medieval world, discovering the magic spells and the items required to defeat an evil wizard. 
Escape From Hell, was developed for Electronic Arts by the game veterans Richard Seaborne and Alan Murphy and was released in 1990. You play Alan in this keyboard-only Role Playing Game and visit Hell, looking for your girlfriend who was accidentally teleported there.
Both games use heavily hardcoded logic which is error prone and requires a lot of testing, so we need your feedback more than ever as they are both incompletely tested. There is sadly only one known demo for Kingdom. Support for the Windows and Mac versions of Kingdom may come later! Please contact us if you have some other demos of both games.
To play any of these games, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker and please take some screenshots along the way!
