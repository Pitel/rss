        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you have family visiting for a Thanksgiving feast and a holiday weekend of relaxation and shopping, there's a good chance the younger demographic will be looking for entertainment. If they have their iPads, they'll likely retreat into YouTube watching mode, but you can use that screen to bring the family together for some fun game time as well. 
I rounded up a handful of games that should deliver entertainment for groups of kids and adults alike. The difficult task is finding games that are available on a wide variety of devices and offer crossplay support – meaning you can play together, even if you are on PlayStation 4 and the kids are on their iPads.
If you are just entertaining one or two kids, I also included a few games that they should get a kick out of, yet are only available on…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've always found it hard to get excited about the Men Of War series. This is admittedly partly down to the name. Short of outright calling your game "War", Men Of War is about as generic a title as you can get for a video game. And I think this was at least partly reflective of the games behind it. Men Of War has generally delivered dependable real-time tactics games, but the series has never excited me in the way that, say, Relic's Company Of Heroes does.
So it's a promising sign that, at the end of Best Way's demonstration of the just-announced Men Of War II, I came away keen to play it.

Four games are up for grabs this month. They are The Escapists 2 on Xbox One, Tropico 5: Penultimate Edition on Xbox One, Orcs Must Die on Xbox 360, and Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet on Xbox 360. Of course, thanks to Xbox’s backward compatibility features, anyone with an Xbox Series X/S or Xbox One can download and play all four of these games. 
The Escapists 2 is a game about, well, escaping... be it from snowy tundras to deserts and more. You and up to three friends can team up to escape from some of the toughest prisons in the world, and you can do so by following the rules, learning the routines, and discovering the best ins and outs of each l…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The ritual is complete.
Normally, if you heard the news that a bunch of creatures were spotted dancing around a much, much taller version of said creatures, you'd be a little concerned that some sort of arcane rite was being performed. We can't say for certain that that's not the case, but at least it's cute.
Back on November 18th, games industry insider Daniel Ahmad posted a few pictures of a mystery, ten-metre-tall Pikachu outside a new Shanghai mall. Today, the reason for the large boi has been revealed: he's part of a partnership between The Pokémon Company and the grand opening of Songjiang INCITY, and he's also a totem around which the smaller dancing Pikachus (which get trotted out at pretty much every event, and sometimes deflate) can gather.

Many reading these pages have owned a Switch for nearly 5 years. We likely have extensive game libraries, a wonky Joy-Con stick or two, and a lot of fond memories. Yet the feverish attempts to wish a Switch 'Pro' into existence this year, as opposed to whenever Nintendo is good and ready to release an upgrade or successor, spoke to that desire for something shiny and a bit more powerful. While millions of Sony and Microsoft players - the lucky ones anyway - are enjoying a new generation of hardware the Switch is looking increasingly creaky, while some ports in recent times are either extremely rough or 'Cloud Versions'.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[According to announcements from both companies, music and rhythm game developer Harmonix is being acquired by Epic Games. 
Epic Games made a statement saying on its website about the company's future, saying, "The Harmonix team will collaborate closely with Epic to develop musical journeys and gameplay for Fortnite while continuing to support existing titles including Rock Band 4."
Harmonix has a brief blog post on its site as well, followed by a short Q&A covering the obvious questions regarding its active support for Rock Band and most recent release FUSER. Here's the statement from Harmonix about joining the Epic family: 
For the time being, the company is sticking to keeping its upcoming seasons and events for its games in the pipeline, and won't be discontinuing support in any way. Other than that, details are scant other than Harmonix games like Rock Bank will continue to stay up and running, though expect the developer to leverage its talents in Fortnite sometime in the future musical talents as well.
Epic has, of course, been dipping its toes into interactive concerts and musical performances in recent years, and that trend will undoubtedly continue and expand with a team like Harmonix under its umbrella. If any team can top what Epic has done with experiences like last summer's Ariana Grande performance, Harmonix would be the group to do it. 
Does this make you hopeful for more dedicated music games, or are you potentially excited for more rhythm content in Fortnite? Give us your thoughts on the Harmonix acquisition in the comments below.]]></summary>

Kojima Productions have confirmed no specific projects or plans yet. Even as someone who has a lot of time and enthusiasm for Kojima's self-serious wacky plots, I hope the plan isn't for anything as banal as a Death Stranding movie. Their video games are delightful because they're video games.

We don't have pages on the internet, but we still love terrible jokes - thus our Back Page features. Today, Kate outsources her job to technology, which seems like one of those cautionary tales...

Here at Nintendo Life HQ, we're constantly trying to think up new ways to add a little pizazz to our front page. Stories about Pikachu? We've heard 'em all. New Smash Bros characters? Too easy to guess. Waluigi gets snubbed again? We knew it.

Developed by BUG-Studio and published by Ratalaika Games, on the surface it looks like a hybrid of Castlevania and Celeste, with decent mobility, locations full of skeletons and more. It certainly seems to have its own identity too, however, including sections where you play as faithful dog Butch, which is no bad thing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo and Illumination announced that Chris Pratt would voice Mario in the upcoming Mario movie exactly two months ago. In those eight weeks, the conversation around this choice has focused on the accent of the famous plumber. Will he be doing the traditional Mario accent, or will he do something else?
In a new interview with TooFab, Mario movie co-producer Chris Meledandri has defended Pratt’s casting, calling his voice for Mario phenomenal.

“All I can tell you is the voice that he’s doing for us, and Mario, is phenomenal,” Meledandri told TooFab. “Yeah, I can’t wait for people to hear it.”
TooFab asked the producer about the decision to cast Pratt, someone who isn’t Italian, as the Italian plumber. Meledandri said he’s an Italian American and understands some of the feelings people have over the casting choice. He said Charlie Day, who is Italian, being cast as Luigi, is this movie’s nod to the Italian background of the famous plumber duo. 
However, Meledandri adds that you can expect the Mario movie to touch on the Italian accent, or rather, lack thereof. 
“We cover it in the movie,” he said. “So, you’ll see we definitely nod to that.” 
Meledandri also said that you should not expect Pratt’s performance to lean too much into the “It’s a-me, Mario!” side of the character, popularized by Charles Martinet, who’s been the voice of Mario for decades. 
While waiting to hear Pratt’s Mario, check out the full cast list for Illumination’s Mario movie.

Partly because it’s not a Friday in any meaningful sense; what feels like a majority of deals start at least a fortnight in advance and continue well into the following week, an almost month-long commerce safari. The best Black Friday deals? Uncountable, not for lack of trying.


I have mixed feelings about it, clearly. I get why some people hate it. But I like having better computer stuff, and I like not having to spend as much money to get it. They’ve kind of got me over a barrel here. Still, while I’d never begrudge anyone climbing above the bottom layers of the ol’ Maslow’s hierarchy, it’s worth making sure that you’re only buying the things you want – not the things a big red “percentage figure off!” sticker makes you think you want. With that in mind, I asked around the RPS crew whether there’s anything specific they’re keeping an eye out for this Black Friday.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Also a bit of a 'metroidvania', if you can forgive the term.
If you like games that are so challenging you're tempted to hurl your controller out of the window, Trash Quest may be one for your radar. Previously released on PC, a small number of user reviews are pretty positive about it as a short, fun and challenging title.
Though it's a 'metroidvania', it's a small map (with the game likely to have a budget price too) in which you always spawn back at the same point each time you die. You will keep your goodies, though, so there'll be plenty of memorisation and practice of each tricky screen or boss encounter.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With it being Xbox’s 20th anniversary this year, the company has done a lot to commemorate the special milestone. There’s the limited edition Adidas shoes, the fancy Halo Xbox Series X, and more. Now, there’s a digital Xbox museum you can peruse through, too. 
Getting there is quite simple – head to museum.xbox.com. We highly recommend signing in because doing so will create a museum space unique to you that features information about your history with Xbox as a brand, your achievements, and more. That’s not all, though. Within the museum are multiple other sections for your metaverse-like avatar to visit: the original Xbox, the Xbox 360, the Xbox One, the Xbox Series X/S, and a Halo section. 
As you walk through each museum section using your keyboard, you can place your 3D avatar into yellow circles on the ground. These circles are found in front of museum exhibits and once in the circle, you can interact with the exhibit to learn more. For example, in the original Xbox space, there’s a circle in front of an exhibit with the title “Bill Gates and The Rock join forces to unveil Xbox.” Upon interacting with this exhibit, you’ll be taken to an interactable story that features information about this unveiling, a video of the event, and more. 
That’s what each of the digital exhibits is like, too, and it seems like making your way through the entire museum would take hours. It’s quite an expansive lineup of information, not to mention it features your own personal history with Xbox in a section as well. 
Head to museum.xbox.com to tour through the exhibit yourself and then catch up on some of Game Informer’s Halo Infinite coverage – it’s Halo’s 20th birthday too this year, after all. After that, check out these Xbox 360 Adidas sneakers and then take a look at this new Halo Xbox Elite controller.

The internet has been a-tinglin' our spidey senses recently with rumours about the upcoming movie Spider-Man: No Way Home flying around social media. Will Maguire and Garfield return for this one? And, perhaps more importantly, will the film be a good one — like the last one with Doc Ock — or will it be a boring one with too many villains — like... well, you know the ones.
Regardless, all the spidey talk has got us jonesing to play the web-slinger in video game form. While Nintendo gamers miss out on the latest (and greatest?) interpretation, a whole load of Spider-Man games have appeared on Nintendo consoles over the years. Switch owners might only be able to play as him in Lego Marvel Super Hero form, but there are plenty of other options on older consoles.

        <updated>2021-11-23T15:40:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When the PlayStation 5 was first revealed last year, the console design was polarizing. On one end of the spectrum, PlayStation fans were excited about the new futuristic, sleek look. In contrast, other consumers were not as impressed, namely in regards to the white faceplates. Once the next-gen console launched, third-party companies began producing different colored faceplates, with black being one of the most popular options on the market. Sony, for the most part, legally brought an end to those competitors. And now, the entertainment conglomerate has been granted its own patent for official PS5 faceplates. 
According to GameSpot, the patent is listed as a “Cover for Electronic Device” and comes paired with a few mock-up sketches of the PlayStation 5. The text within the patent claim mentions a “Skin cover for PS5 console” and “the ornamental design for a cover for an electronic device.” 
Of course, this doesn’t immediately equate to a future where Sony-labeled faceplates might be sold at your local electronic establishments. For all we know, nothing will come of this. But it’s nice to imagine a new look for the PlayStation 5. Only time will tell what this patent means for the console’s aesthetic. 
Do you think this is simply Sony cornering the market without the intention of actually releasing faceplates? Or are we going to see this patent put to use? Throw down your theories in the comments below!

Mortal Kombat has done some impressive work lately when it comes to pulling in characters from other media franchises. We've had RoboCop, The Terminator and even Shaggy, and, given that the series is about to return to cinemas, it would be fair to predict that The Matrix's Neo – played by Keanu Reeves – might be in with a chance of going head-to-head with the likes of Raiden and Sub-Zero.
It's also fair to say that John Wick – another action-heavy character portrayed by Reeves – would be well-suited to a Mortal Kombat cameo. NetherRealm head Ed Boon has previously mentioned that he'd love to see both characters in Mortal Kombat 11, in fact.

When the voice cast for Mario's upcoming movie was revealed back in September, it's safe to say that fans had concerns. While Mario's usual voice actor Charles Martinet will feature in the film in an as-yet-unannounced capacity, it's Hollywood star Chris Pratt who'll be taking on the role of Nintendo's beloved moustachioed plumber, and the decision has been bouncing around like a Marmite-covered seesaw ever since.
Love him or hate him, Pratt seems to be looking forward to releasing the film, telling his fans on Instagram that "dreams come true" when talking about the role. As it happens, the film's co-producer Chris Meledandri is also excited to get the film in front of fans and has suggested that Pratt's Mario voice will be worth the wait.

Last Friday, Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl hit store shelves, finally giving fans a remake of the series' beloved fourth generation of games. Early sales data suggests they're off to a flying start, which shouldn't really come as any surprise, and their launch has just become that extra bit special.
That's all because of James Turner, a graphic designer responsible for plenty of your favourite Pokémon. Game Freak's talented artist is back with a new piece celebrating the new games, showcasing both box art stars Dialga and Palkia in his signature style. Check it out:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ready to play the reaper's game?
Despite all the innovation that frequently takes place in the indie space, there’s an awful lot of games that are content to just do what’s already been done. It can be easy to become jaded, then, when a lot of these copycat games turn out to be worse than their clear inspiration. After all, who wants to waste their time playing a weak approximation of a better game? However, every now and then a game like Death's Door comes along. Death’s Door is a game that you’ve probably played before — and we don't just mean on other platforms where it's been available for months. Developer Acid Nerve doesn’t do anything new per se, yet delivers a tremendously well-designed experience that shows true mastery of the mechanics and genres it was inspired by, making for a game you won’t want to miss.
Death’s Door begins by placing you in the role of an adorable little crow who works as a Reaper at the Reaping Commission Headquarters, a Kafkaesque bureaucracy which is responsible for administrating the process of death. Every now and then there are beings that refuse to die, and these special cases are where Reapers like your character are dispatched to kill them and collect their souls. However, a Reaper is temporarily made mortal while on a mission, and they only regain their immortality status once the soul they were assigned is successfully brought back. This usually isn’t a problem, until someone intervenes in your character’s first assignment and casts your target soul behind the eponymous Death’s Door. To open it and retrieve your soul, you have no choice but to track down the owners of the three Giant Souls and kill them so you can win back your immortality.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Keanu Reeves has revealed that he doesn’t believe Mortal Kombat to be a good fit for John Wick or Neo. 
It’s always tough when you hear people you look up to say something wrong, but sometimes you just have to power through it and that’s what we’re all doing after Reeves told Esquire he doesn’t want his characters in Mortal Kombat. As reported by GameSpot, it’s not that Reeves isn’t a fan of Mortal Kombat – he just thinks John Wick and Neo don’t belong. 
“If it was up to me? No, Mortal Komat is awesome in so many ways, but I think...you know, Neo, John Wick, they’re doing their own thing,” Reeves told Esquire. “Mortal Kombat is doing their own thing.” 
Look, Reeves certainly knows these characters more than us Internet folks who want to see Neo lean back to dodge Scorpion’s infamous “get over here” chain attack, but c’mon, no to John Wick as well? That character is a trained assassin that has killed anyone in his way – surely Sub-Zero doesn’t stand a chance. 
Regardless, there might still be a chance despite what Reeves says. As noted by GameSpot, Mortal Kombat and its developer NetherRealm are owned by Warner Bros. which is the same company that owns The Matrix franchise...so the possibility is there. In fact, Game Informer reported in 2019 that series creator Ed Boon said NetherRealm was “pretty close” to adding Neo to Injustice 2. 
Speaking of Injustice 2, check out our thoughts on the DC fighter in Game Informer’s Injustice 2 review and then read Game Informer’s Mortal Kombat 11 review. Check out our review of its DLC, Aftermath, after that.

Since the dawn of time – well, since the late '90s, at least – Pokémon fans have had to deal with a trading card market full of dodgy knockoffs and counterfeit goods. Buying new packs from reliable stores is usually just fine, but picking up cards second hand or buying them from less trustworthy shopkeepers has always been a very risky business.
With the Pokémon Trading Card Game enjoying even higher-than-usual levels of popularity just lately – 3.7 billion cards were sold during the fiscal year 2020-2021, equating to 10.8% of all-time Pokémon card sales – it's hardly surprising to see that fake goods are still doing the rounds. And in great numbers, too.

There are over 350 of them, from making gangsters less flirty to giving Al Capone his cigar back on the character select screen. It’s no act of Capone-worthy self-mythologising, then, when game director Brenda Romero describes the patch list to me as “monstrous”. 


“Once we put out the immediate flames, we prioritised feedback,” says Romero “Chris [King, senior systems designer]'s hair was fully black when we launched this game. It’s all gone fully grey. I think we were awesome on launch. Incredibly responsive. The team worked their asses off.”


Thankfully, the launch of the Make It Count DLC - and the accompanying free Precinct update - has been a lot smoother.

Still, you can't shake the anxiety of what might happen if – no – when you lose. You play on, the eyes on the other side of the table slowly burning a hole in your stomach.

It also revealed that Year 2 is starting in less than two months.

“Hitman 3 – Year 2 will start on [January 20, 2022] with post-launch support confirmed for another 12 months,” IO writes in the blog. “New maps, storylines, modes, and ways to play are all lined up for 2022, which is set to be another exciting year.” 
Also, coming to Hitman 3 next year is ray tracing on PC. Plus, PC VR support is coming in January, as is a new Elusive Target Arcade mode. 
“A new way to play Elusive Targets arrives in Hitman 3 in a brand new game mode that we’re calling Elusive Target Arcade,” the blog post reads. “Prepare to take on the ultimate Elusive Target challenge in a change to the established formula in this fan-favourite game mode. All Elusive Target Arcade content will be a permanent addition to the game. Full details on how this game mode works will be shared in early January 2022.”
The blog post ends with a “[REDACTED] update that states that IO has a “major update to the game planned” for Spring 2022. No other details were given, but the image below was included with it. 
While waiting for Year 2 to begin, check out our thoughts on the game in Game Informer’s Hitman 3 review and then read the Game Awards 2021 nominations to see where Hitman 3 appears.

Just one week after the highly-anticipated remasters released everywhere, Rockstar Games promised the originals would eventually be available on PC in an effort to calm angry fans. The Red Dead Redemption developer released a statement acknowledging that “the updated versions of these classic games did not launch in a state that meets our own standards of quality, or the standards our fans have come to expect.” Some players, however, are taking matters into their own hands. GTA Trilogy modders are working together to fix the game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Game Boy-like device known as the Analogue Pocket will finally ship out in three weeks. 
More specifically, the first batch of devices will begin shipping on December 13 and orders are expected to reach customers sometime between December 14 and December 30. This news comes after multiple delays for the Pocket, most of which occurred due to ongoing shipping struggles and chip shortages due to the global COVID-19 pandemic. 
If you preordered the Pocket, you should have received an email already from Analogue that states the Pocket will ship in three weeks. That email also includes information about delaying your order should you be out of town for the holidays when it’s delivered. 
“We understand that some of you will be away during the holiday season and would prefer delivery in the new year,” Analogue’s announcement reads. “With this in mind, we are offering to hold your package over the holiday period and start shipping on January 3. If you cannot accept delivery between December 14 and December 30, you should request a hold for your order.”
The final date to change your order is November 28, and Analogue says no changes can be made following that. The email you’ve received includes more instructions on how to go about those changes, if necessary. While waiting for your Pocket to ship, check out the various features it includes and the accessories that go with it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Kojima Productions is opening a new California-based business division that will focus on movies and television. 
It’s no secret that Kojima, the famed game director behind the Metal Gear Solid series and Death Stranding, is a fan of movies and TV. All it takes is one glance at his Instagram feed to realize that. His primary focus has always been games, but it seems his studio, Kojima Productions, is preparing for a shift to other entertainment mediums. 
“Today, I can finally confirm that Kojima Productions will be opening a new business division in California, USA,” division lead Riley Russell writes in a press release. “The new division will be tasked with working with creative and talented professionals in television, music, and film, as well as the more familiar games industry. The team has as its charter, the goal of expanding the reach and awareness of the properties now under development at Kojima Productions, and to make them even more a part of our popular culture.” 
Kojima Productions business development manager, Yoshiko Fukuda, says this new division will take the studio into new sectors to develop narratives beyond video games. 
As for what to expect first from this business division, that’s unclear, although Russell does mention that it will focus on expanding narratives outside of games based on games currently in development at the studio. Perhaps it’s cooking up a Death Stranding TV series, or maybe a film based on some game the studio is working on that hasn’t even been announced yet. Only time will tell. 
While waiting to learn more, check out Game Informer’s thoughts on Death Stranding and then read this story about why Death Stranding Director’s Cut is worth another trek across America.

The two most notable changes coming to Deathloop by way of this update are that NPCs are a lot smarter now, and Colt will have a harder time avoiding Julianna during an invasion, as reported by Digital Trends.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The first season of Game Informer’s Video Gameography explores the history of the Metroid series. We're knee-deep in the Prime era now, and we're tackling Samus' sophomore 3D outing, Metroid Prime 2: Echoes. 
This sequel to the acclaimed Metroid Prime was released November 15, 2004 in the U.S. and upped the ante with Zelda-style dark world/light world exploration. Players traverse two versions of a labyrinthine map, solving puzzles that opened paths in the opposite dimension and enduring the damaging effects of the dark world. Samus faces off against Dark Samus for the first time, one of a series of challenging boss encounters that cemented Echoes as the most challenging entry in the Prime series – for better or worse. 
Join hosts Ben Reeves (@BenjaminReeves), Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), and Nintendo Ambassadors/Metroid fanatics Ky and Kyle Parker (@CaptDangerous64, @admiralboogaloo) for the next hour as we explore Metroid Prime 2's lore, development history, and lasting impact. 
If you'd like to get in touch with the Video Gameography podcast, you can email us at podcast@gameinformer.com. You can also join our official Game Informer Discord server by linking your Discord account to your Twitch account and subscribing to the Game Informer Twitch channel.

Growing more than 84 percent year-over-year to the tune of a staggering 83 million livestream views, The Game Awards has become one of the video game industry’s biggest events. But we aren’t just tuning in to find out which title will be crowned Game of the Year; we are also there for the World Premieres, which shine the spotlight on new games we’ll be playing in the years ahead. Some publishers save their biggest surprises for The Game Awards, a show that almost didn’t exist.
For a decade, Keighley was the producer and host of Spike TV’s Video Game Awards, a show that started strong in the early 2000s, but fizzled out in 2013 due to poor viewership numbers and criticism over the show’s format. For the 2014 show, …]]></summary>

In that spirit, I’ve been thinking about buying four more of my current monitor and lashing them together into a makeshift array using rope fashioned from my corgi’s shed hair. There’s no way that I could achieve such an impressive display in any other way, certainly not with a single monitor. At least that’s what I thought, until hardware ed James reminded me that the humongous Samsung Odyssey G9 exists.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Having released half of the game earlier this week (albeit in beta), 343 Industries has announced Halo Infinite is ready to make preparations for release in a few weeks.
#HaloInfinite has officially gone gold!
https://t.co/WUyHTqp6yp pic.twitter.com/bIbmyCParc
November 19, 2021
In a tweet this afternoon on the Halo account, the message sent was very clear, saying, "#HaloInfinite has officially gone gold! We'll see you on December 8, Spartans." The tweet was followed by a map of release times for regions across the world. Well, specifically when the campaign releases.
Forgoing the typical midnight release, Halo Infinite's single-player campaign will see the light of day (literally), landing at 10 a.m. Pacific on December 8. Other release times for various time zones can be seen below, although note that New York should say EST and has not moved into the Central time zone.
Of course, if you want to play Halo Infinite right now, you can! The multiplayer section of the game is available right now on Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC, and is free to play. After a somewhat surprise launch on Monday as part of Microsoft's Xbox 20th anniversary celebration, 343 Industries unleashed an open beta of Halo Infinite on the gaming public.
We discuss our time with the multiplayer beta on this week's Game Informer Show, but that's not all! Halo Infinite is gracing the current cover of Game Informer, where we have pages upon pages of information about the game. It's technically also the first place Halo Infinite went gold. Game Informer Gold, that is. Check out that incredible ultra-rare print variant here. Also, check out the trifecta of New Gameplay Today videos released today, showing off that now-golden campaign.]]></summary>

For instance, I remember a time, a few years either side of 2000/Y2K/The Willenium, when really big pockets were a thing. Particularly if you were a bit nu-metal or a bit goth. They were great. There’s nothing like walking down the street with your Gameboy banging against your knee. Sadly, as technology shrank faster and faster, so did trousers, until everyone was stuck with skinny jeans that you can’t even squeeze a bit of change into. It’s especially frustrating as I reckon you could happily fit the lovely Logitech G915 TKL Lightspeed Wireless into one of those big pockets.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A week after Rockstar Games released Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition, the company is returning the original versions of those games to PC.
The PC versions of GTA III, Vice City, and San Andreas were removed from digital storefronts in preparation for the remastered editions. However, poor reception from consumers has spurred Rockstar to make the originals available through the Rockstar Store.
In an announcement on its website, the developer explained the decision saying, "The updated versions of these classic games did not launch in a state that meets our own standards of quality, or the standards our fans have come to expect." Owners of the PC edition of the remaster through the Rockstar Store are being taken care of. Rockstar says, "We will be adding the classic PC versions of Grand Theft Auto III, Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, and Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas back to the Rockstar Store shortly as a bundle. Additionally, everyone who has purchased Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition for PC from the Rockstar Store through June 30, 2022, will receive these classic versions in their Rockstar Games Launcher library at no additional cost."
While this make-good takes care of specific PC gamers, there's no word on those who own the package on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, or other PC storefronts. Rockstar does say it's committed to fixing the issues with GTA: The Trilogy stating, "We have ongoing plans to address the technical issues and to improve each game going forward," and, "A new Title Update is on the way in the coming days for all versions of Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition that will address a number of issues."
Last week on Twitch, Andrew Reiner and I explored GTA: The Trilogy for a few hours, and while I had a pretty good time waxing nostalgic with the series, I was fairly put off by some of the graphical changes. Especially the sheets of nightmarish rain plaguing Grand Theft Auto III.]]></summary>

Originally released in 2006, Pokémon Diamond and Pearl ushered in a new generation of Pokémon games onto the Nintendo DS. With the themes of evolution and creation woven throughout the story, the upgraded designs of the new Pokémon found throughout the Sinnoh region, as well as newly discovered evolutionary lines of fan-favorite monsters, these games felt like a notable step forward for the franchise.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's no time to explain: the Intel Core i5-12600K has a Black Friday deal. I mean that's weird, right? It only came out scant weeks ago and it's already on the sharp end of a meaningful discount. Not that I'm complaining, mind, as this Intel 12th Gen Alder Lake mid-ranger proved itself the best CPU for gaming immediately upon arrival.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Slipping into a military-controlled ‘dark zone’ to plunder some high-end electrical equipment sounded like an easy job. You could be in and out in minutes, in theory, slinking through the locked-down multi-storey car park with a nice sequence of slides and skids to grab your treasure before vaulting a fence and scampering off. But there’s a problem: the lights are out, down in these concrete depths. The zombies are strong here. Special banshee-like screechers are primed to alert their undead brethren to the presence of any would-be intruders, prompting an unending wave of decaying meat to fling itself at you, all teeth and claws.


So this mission requires more finesse. You need to use all that agility and poise you’ve mastered in Dying Light 2’s impressive parkour 'n' puching open-world city, sure, but you also need to layer more skills on top of that, cherry-picked from the new toolkit Techland has provided.

Typically, to get yourself behind the yoke of a space cruiser in Star Citizen, you'd have to cough up at least $45 for access to one of the game's more basic ships. However, like a real-life car show (or a trip to almost any vehicle dealership), IAE 2951 will let intrepid pilots test out over 120 different flyable ships from various fictional manufacturers. Each day of the event will shift focus to specific ship companies and their wares.

While not the first Museum style collection (it's a follow-up to 2014's Pac-Man Museum), this newest iteration includes popular modern titles such as Pac-Man Championship Edition and Pac-Man 256 and oddities like the Wii-exclusive Pac-Motos. The full list of titles is as follows:
Pac-Man
Super Pac-Man
Pac & Pal
Pac-Land
Pac-Mania
Pac-Attack
Pac-In-Time
Pac-Man Arrangement (Arcade Version)
Pac-Man Arrangement (Console Version)
Pac-Man Championship Edition
Pac-Motos
Pac ‘N Roll Remix
Pac-Man Battle Royale
Pac-Man 256
To access each game, you’ll explore an actual arcade as Pac-Man himself, which is pretty meta. This arcade can be customized to your liking Animal Crossing-style by purchasing decor using coins earned by completing in-game missions. 
Pac-Man Museum + gobbles its way to Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC in early 2022.]]></summary>

The problem with Roblox for them is that it's a lawless frontier town, one they don't control. Still, Roblox is obscenely popular, so it's popular with brands who don't need control, they just want to advertise products. Enter Nikeland, an official Roblox game from the cobblers at Nike.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve spent some more time with FPS Battlefield 2042, having freed myself from EA’s vice grip. And it’s safe to say the fields of battle have taken on a vastly different complexion now it’s largely in the hands of many more players. Compared to my three-night imprisonment alongside other journos and influencers, my feelings have definitely levelled out.
The honeymoon period is over, basically. My relationship with the game in the real world, outside of EAs strict boundaries has lessened. I’m sorry to say it, but we’ve grown apart. Things are average between us, and perhaps only Portal, the game’s custom mode creator, can salvage things.

Battlefield has always been the largest and loudest multiplayer experience in the business. It’s the video game equivalent of Texas, and its bombast cannot be overstated. Battlefield 2042 offers a variety of ways to participate in simulated near-future warfare. Whether you prefer to fight via land or sky, you can experience dizzying on-screen explosions, tense firefights, and more vehicles than teammates who know how to drive them. Unfortunately, Battlefield 2042 is full of almost as many bugs as bad pilots, dragging down an otherwise solid online shooter.

Even our Deathloop review said "stealth is just the thing that goes wrong before a good fight". Well, you might want to be a bit sneakier now, as the game's second major update has arrived and it makes NPCs a fair bit smarter. The patch addresses some common complaints about the PvP Invasion mode too.

Developers 343 Industries did whatever the opposite of a jumpscare is this week, delighting deathmatch dilly-dalliers with a surprise release of their classical arena shooter. It's a beta, they insist. But we all know it's the proper game because they've had their betas already (excuse me, "flights"). 
Also, look, this thing is impeccable. Clean, powerful shots trace across immaculate skyboxes, straight into the shining dome of your armoured clunkperson, with a frightening thud that is satisfying even in death. There are problems, of course, but most reside outside the actual shootouts, which are frenetic, zappy confrontations longtime Halo players will savour.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back when Black Friday was only just revving up its deals engines, I asked you – the lovely RPS readership – to tell us about your hardware. And it turns out that just like in 2019, your collective favourite gaming mouse is the Logitech G502. Truly, a timeless classic of clicks and scrolls.


Of course, the G502 has come in a few different flavours, but you can now get one of the most recent models at the lowest price it’s ever been (at least in the UK). Amazon has the Logitech G502 SE Hero for £34: an entire pound less than the standard G502 Hero has ever dipped to, most recently during Prime Day 2021. 


US denizens aren’t missing out either, as the G502 SE Hero is $33 at Best Buy in their own Black Friday sale. That’s not quite as cheap as its all-time low of $28, but its still a very good price on a very good mouse. The G502 SE Hero is essentially the classic G502 Hero with some white go-faster stripes – there’s been no funny business making adverse changes to keep the costs down.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Thymesia is an upcoming action-adventure game that puts you in the shoes of the world's toughest plague doctor who uses diseases-turned-weapons to battle enemies. The fast-paced action RPG sports heavy Dark Souls vibes and was slated to launch on December 7. Unfortunately, that will no longer be the case because Thymesia is now arriving sometime in 2022.
Developer OverBorder Studio states it wants to make sure Thymesia is razor-sharp for its big debut, so it's leaving it in the oven for a while longer. On the bright side, it announced the game is headed to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S after only confirming PC in the past.
Thymesia stars Corvus, a plague doctor who’s half-man, half-raven. He’s on a mission to regain his lost memories while also slaying abominations lurking within his gloomy kingdom. Combat is fast-paced and punishing, emphasizing aggression and mobility thanks to a swift dodge maneuver. Corvus can extract diseases from foes, then transform them into weapons such as a scythe or sword. He can also utilize his raven form to unleash dagger-like feathers. You can mold Corvus to your liking thanks to multiple character builds, as well as different endings to encourage replayability. Check out the original announcement trailer below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following Sony Interactive Entertainment’s purchase of Evolution Championship Series, more commonly known as EVO, Smash Bros. fans were left wondering what could come of the usual Smash Bros. tournaments featured at the annual EVO showcases. The global COVID-19 pandemic threw its own wrench in EVO’s in-person showcases, but it seems Nintendo is ready to officially support the Smash tournament scene. 
“Confirmed. Ready your A-game, Super Smash Bros competitors. We’ve partnered with Panda Global to launch the first officially licenses Super Smash Bros. championship circuit in North America, coming 2022.”

November 18, 2021
As you can see in the tweet above, Nintendo has partnered with Panda Global to bring “the first officially licensed circuit for Super Smash Bros. Ultimate and Super Smash Bros. Melee to North America.” This is especially unprecedented as Nintendo has often remained quite mum on support for the Melee tournament scene. 
It’s unclear exactly what these tournaments will look like – we’ll find out next year – but Panda says they’ll feature cash prizes. 
While waiting for more information, read about Sony’s purchase of EVO and then check out this story about the final fighter in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. Read about Masahiro Sakurai’s journey to get Sora added to the game after that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Few genres provide the simple pleasure of a good old-fashioned beat ‘em up. After all, these arcade-style games let you and your buddies punch and kick dozens of often colorful enemies in the face. What’s not to love? Double-teaming mobs of enemies or a sturdy boss strengthens bonds. Conversely, repeatedly grabbing health pick-ups “on accident” with a full health bar while your friend hangs on by a thread can reveal cracks in a relationship. Whatever side of the fence you’re on, we’ve all likely played these sorts of games, and the last decade has seen modernized takes on the winning formula. Here are 10 of the best contemporary beat ‘em ups (in no particular order) that you can play right now. No quarters necessary.

“Playtonic...will use the investment to scale from their current one team structure to multiple teams, with an emphasis on hiring diverse talent from near and afar, improving their HQ, as well as looking to expand in new locations,” Playtonic’s blog post reads. 
Playtonic founder Gavin Price says Tencent’s investment will help the studio scale-up and fast-track the “super-exciting, super-secret projects we’ve been keeping close to our treasure chests.” The expansion of the studio has already begun, too, with Playtonic hiring Danny Spiteri, formerly of Raw Fury and Team 17, as its new Head of Publishing.

Ahead of the release of Resident Evil: Welcome To Raccoon City next week, we have an exclusive new featurette that briefly dives into the relationship between the movie's production team and the video game series' development team at Capcom. Check it out in full above. 
One fun tidbit detailed in the trailer is director Johannes Roberts sneaking in nods to his favorite games in the series: 
"Director Johannes [Roberts] really loves the games, so there are a lot of Easter eggs in the movie," Capcom producer Hiroyuki Kobayashi says in the video. "One of my personal favorites is, though the movie is based on games 1 and 2, director Johannes snuck in some of his favorite elements from a later game. Hope you can find it." 
For more on Welcome To Raccoon City, check our interview with two of the film's leads, Tom Hopper and Avan Jogia, who play Albert Wesker and Leon Kennedy, respectively, where we talk about co-leading this new Resident Evil film series, their favorite moments from filming, and where they found inspiration for their characters.

For the last few weeks I've been puzzling over the lingering feeling that it could have been more ambitious. Why do I think it could have pushed the trireme out further? Is it possible to make a modern RTS that captures the best of the classics without simply rehashing them? Has it even been done already and gone unrecognised?

Resident Evil: Welcome To Raccoon City will be released in theaters next week on November 24. It's perhaps one of the more interesting video game movies ever released. Not narratively or stylistically, but rather in the shoes it has to fill. Welcome To Raccoon City is a complete reimagining of the Resident Evil world for the big screen, coming off the heels of Paul W.S. Anderson's Resident Evil film series, which ran for six movies, netting more than a billion dollars in box office revenue. 
Where Anderson took the Resident Evil source material and made his own science fiction universe, Welcome To Raccoon City – directed by Johannes Roberts (47 Meters Down, The Strangers: Prey At Night) – sticks far closer to the first two games in the series. It results in a far more grounded story, focusing on characters fans have known for decades. 
Ahead of the movie's release next week, we sat down with two of its stars, Tom Hopper and Avan Jogia, who play Albert Wesker and Leon Kennedy, respectively, to talk about co-leading this new Resident Evil film series, their favorite moments from filming, and where they found inspiration for their characters.

If you’ve been waiting to try your hand at the looping adventure or simply want to take it on the go, December 9 is the date to look out for.
For those unfamiliar with Loop Hero, it has a unique premise. To save the world from destruction, a hero roams a looping track filled with monsters and other hazards. However, you don’t control your hero directly; instead, you create the world in which he’ll explore. By strategically placing a variety of creatures, terrain types, and obstacles, your auto-moving hero grows stronger with every baddie slain. The key is to throw just enough at the hero to increase its strength without accidentally overwhelming them and causing their demise. In between runs, you'll build up a settlement with different shops to unlock equipment and buffs to increase your odds for the next loop.

Loop Hero is one of those titles best played yourself to truly understand its hooks. In our review of the PC version, we scored the game an 8.5 out of 10. Reviewer Dan Tack noted that “Loop Hero is a creative and clever little game that should be on your radar if you enjoy strategy, RPGs, deckbuilders, roguelikes, or all of the above. While its novelty begins to wither the further you get away from your opening hours, the journey is worthwhile and engaging.”
Loop Hero is priced at $14.99 but you can pre-order it on the eShop now for a 10% discount ($13.49).]]></summary>

Developer: Visual Concepts
		

WWE fans know that the company has been in a chaotic state as of late. Dozens of roster cuts this year have not only put fans on edge about the long-term fates of their favorite Superstars, but they've also brought into question the status of WWE 2K22. It's the first wrestling sim since 2019's ill-received 2K20, and the game is forgoing the series' usual fall release window for a March 2022 launch. That extra time seemingly gives Visual Concepts time to polish up a few holds, so what can fans expect? While Visual Concepts is still withholding most information until its previously announced January unveiling, it did provide a sneak peek into the features and improvements its concocted so far.

No, because you all know what I mean and so does Nate. Matthew doesn't, know, and had prepared a list of just, companion characters. Don't worry, he actually pulls out some really good examples. We talk about a lot of games this week, not least because I didn't prepare a Cavern Of Lies again. Sorry. There is also a lot of talk about clones, and what Matthew would do with clones of himself (e.g. shove them out of an airlock).

I’m sure the engineering is marvelous and the innovation groundbreaking. But let’s be honest, in videogames they’re virtually all the same.
My Forza Horizon 5 fantasy doesn’t involve Lamborghinis or Ferraris. In fact, it’s the complete opposite of opulence. Mexico’s roads are for me and my mundane companions. The Volvo Estate, the Ford Focus, the Honda Civic. The everyday vehicles that make up for their lack of speed with heaps of character. I just wish there were more to choose from.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Victura and Highwire Games have announced that Six Days in Fallujah, a controversial shooter based on the real-life Battle of Fallujah that occurred during the Iraq War, has been delayed to 2022. 
More specifically, the shooter has been delayed to Q4 of 2022, citing that the team behind it needs more people to hit the level of quality the studio is striving for. It also requires more capital and time, hence the delay. 
“It became clear that recreating these true stories at a high quality was going to require more people, capital, and time than we had,” Victura CEO Peter Tamte said in the delay announcement. “Doubling our team is just one of the many things we’re doing to make sure Six Days in Fallujah brings new kinds of tactical and emotional depth to military shooters.” 
Atomic Games attempted to release a game set during the Battle of Fallujah way back in 2009. However, the project was rightfully criticized for the developer’s decision to alongside the CIA to publish the game, with many calling it propaganda. Ultimately, Atomic Games’ project was re-revealed back in February with news that Victura and Highwire Games were helming the Fallujah-centric game instead. 
The studio said around the announcement that the team had spent over three years building unique technology to overhaul the game and its mechanics. It also revealed that it hopes to go beyond simply presenting another shooter and instead show the realities of war and its consequences. However, the re-reveal was criticized much in the same way the first attempt at this game was. 
Only time will tell what the final product turns out to be, but now we know it’s not coming until at least Q4 of next year. 
While waiting for that, check out Game Informer’s coverage of the original 2009 reveal and then read about the Six Days in Fallujah revival after that.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Undungeon is a peculiar action RPG set at the end of the universe, in which you play an immortal herald called Void who has been pieced together by God themselves using a primordial stew of hot organs, conscious essence and wet rib cages. Something very complicated has happened to reality, and you’re here to fix it with your swooshing Freddy Kreuger claws and clever dialogue choices. 


I’m still not entirely sure what Undungeon is about. The characters, a cast of hovering orbs, corrupted flesh angels and crystal beings, repeatedly try to explain what’s going on, but it never quite sinks in. Collapsing dimensions are causing no end of trouble, that’s pretty clear, shattering into an infinite number of spinning shards that rain like an exotic meteor shower over a scorched wasteland inhabited by nomadic technomancers and acid-spitting scorpions. You’re sent down to the dusty mortal plane to plug everything back in again and reset the multiverse, like an interdimensional BT engineer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Capcom’s upcoming sci-fi title, Pragmata, has been delayed to 2023. 
Pragmata was first announced during the PlayStation 5 reveal event way back in June 2020. It featured an astronaut walking through New York who stumbles upon a little girl. A strange glitch-in-the-matrix happens and all of a sudden, a satellite crashes through the sky and then the duo ends up in space after using some weird 3D printer-like device. It’s as strange as it sounds, as you can see from the Pragmata announcement trailer. 
However, when it was first revealed, Capcom said the game would release in 2022. Now, it’s been delayed to 2023, which isn’t all that surprising considering that 2020 look at the title was the last we heard about Pragmata. 
An update on #PRAGMATA:

As you can see in the tweet above, Capcom released a new video alongside news of this delay. It features Pragmata’s young heroine holding a piece of paper with “2022” scratched out and “2023” written beside it. The company also released new artwork, which you can see below:

This update was revealed on Nintendo’s YouTube yesterday in a new video showcasing all you can expect in 2.0. In it, Nintendo reveals the new split-screen multiplayer mode coming to Mario Kart Live, which is the company’s toys-to-life-esque kart racer that tasks players with building a track in their own house and then racing a real Mario Kart RC car around it.

The new Split-Screen mode is exactly what you’d expect in a Mario Kart game: place two karts onto the track, round up two controllers, and race your friend or foe on-screen. It looks pretty identical to a standard Mario Kart split-screen mode, except it’s your living room on the screen rather than Bowser’s Castle. 
If two players aren’t enough, you can bring in two more thanks to Mario Kart Live’s new Relay Race mode. In this mode, two players will be on one kart, and they can swap control of the wheel back and forth, meaning up to four people can play at once. Three new courses have been added: Windmill Meadows, Music Broadway, and King Boo’s Courtyard. Plus, Luigi’s Poltergust is now a customization item available for use alongside the Spooky Horn. You must complete the Luigi Cup under certain conditions in the Grand Prix to unlock them, though.

It's a demo Halo fans will never forget. In 2020, developer 343 Industries brought its latest take on the Halo franchise to the masses during one of Microsoft's digital events. Halo Infinite's gameplay debut was met with some positivity but spawned an online firestorm and popularized conversation around Craig The Brute, among other discussions. It's been over a year since fans were shown that demo, and a lot has changed ahead of Halo Infinite's campaign release on December 8. Before that long-awaited day, join us for a unique updated look at the campaign in all its new shining glory.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you haven’t heard, we're in the middle of an indiepocalypse. It’s probably not the kind you’re thinking of; it doesn’t spell doom for the independent games scene. This one is a monthly compilation of games all in one conveniently packaged digital zine, from a variety of diverse creators. That Indiepocalypse. 


Indiepocalypse is composed of 10 games every month, one of which has been commissioned by Editor in Chief Andrew Baillie personally. Started in February 2020, the zine has already managed to rack up 22 issues, as well as one bonus issue. You never know what you’re going to get from one issue to the next, each one platforming small games that likely wouldn’t succeed elsewhere. There’s no exclusivity clause either, meaning developers are free to do what they want with their games outside of the zine. Most importantly, every developer included is paid. Baillie spoke to me about how and why Indiepocalypse started.

But a lot of players have one major grievance: the battle pass is a massive grind. Complaints about challenges that award very little XP are all over the game's subreddit. Fortunately, the devs have seen this feedback, and are already looking into the slow progression.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There’s something about Call Of Duty: Vanguard and its multiplayer modes that feels thin. Much like my time with the game’s campaign, I’m left wanting. This is a World War II veneer glossed over a Modern Warfare canvas, with familiar pacing and shooting, but ultimately lacking the weight of Infinity Ward’s reboot.
As a Call Of Duty multiplayer experience, Vanguard delivers. But what it delivers is a stop-gap. An FPS experience that isn’t concerned with pushing the series forwards, or taking risks. Fans will have fun, sure, but its deathmatches and dominations are stuck in the past. Not to mention Zombies, which is too eager to turn back the clock.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[New World, Amazon Games' opening move into game dev, was not always an MMORPG. It used to be a survival horror game. According to Katy Kaszynski, senior producer at Amazon Games, the team got really far down that road. "They created it. That was before my time, but that game was almost done," Kaszynski tells me, just after delivering a presentation on New World's development at this year's Develop Conference in Brighton. "They really thought it was going to go alpha, launch, and they were going to ship that out."
A survival horror is pretty different from the jaunty, vaguely piratical, magical fantasy RPG that New World is today: lush forests, sunny grassy plains, and factions engaged in an endless war for territory. So what happened? According to Kaszynski, it's all down to Amazon's first 'Leadership Principle': Customer Obsession.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I didn't really have the luxury of devoting a cool 500 words to a single character in my Sherlock Holmes Chapter One review, firstly because I'm a believer in word economy, but secondly because what I wanted to talk about is a bit of a spoiler. It's integral to the plot of the game and it's revealed very quickly once you start playing, but it's also not mentioned in any of the promo blurbs or marketing, so I'm guessing it's meant to be a fun little "Oh!" moment. On the other hand, I do really want to talk about how cool Sherlock's best mate Jon is...
So if you want to go into Frogwares' new detect 'em up cold, then save this and come back to it after you've played about, ooh, 45 minutes? I think that's long enough to get clear of spoiler territory.

The development team at Techland has moved on from Dying Light’s setting of Harran in a nuclear-powered ‘salt the earth’ parting blow, and has shifted focus to Villedor. You play as a stranger, Aiden, travelling to this once-majestic capital to locate his missing sister, and the second you step foot into its guarded walls you’re faced with a city kitbashed together from pieces of Paris, Berlin, Hamburg, Ostrow and other European landmarks. In Villedor proper – a city that’s been designed by actual town planners and urban designers – you see the scope of what Techland is going for. This is a big game, with some big ideas. It’s not just more of the same Dying Light.

Thankfully, Microsoft have now seen the cerulean light, and are planning to restore the azure annihilator in a future patch.

One modder has even fixed the nut on the Tuff Nut Donuts sign, which, for some baffling reason, had been rounded out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Barry Hattrick has just signed a two-year contract with Stockport County FC. The 36-year-old former full-back, a Stockport native and lifelong fan of the Vanarama National League club, has a tactical style best described as 'my dad after three pints'. Route-one, 4-4-2, and no 'larking about'. He thinks a gegenpress is something you use to get the creases out of your trousers.
Hattrick is a quintessentially English anachronism, whose ignorance of the modern game represents my own unfamiliarity with modern Football Manager. It's been quite some time since I last sported the greying temples and Fray-Bentos paunch of football's favourite scapegoat, and returning to Football Manager is a bit like meeting up with an old girlfriend after they've had their consciousness uploaded into an all-knowing AI. I vaguely recognise the face behind all the ones and zeroes, but that person I once snuggled up with on winter evenings has ascended into something vast, intimidating, and utterly obsessed with data.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Moncage is one of those puzzle games of intermittent lightbulb moments. One minute you see solutions with perfect clarity. The next you're left scratching your head and wondering how the heck you're meant to proceed. It wouldn't be much of a puzzle game if there weren't a few moments like this, of course, but when you're playing out mechanical riddles across five possible surfaces - in this case, the sides and top of a rotatable cube - Moncage can sometimes veer into giving you a complete cerebral blackout, leaving you at an impasse until you consult its series of timed hints (or, if you're really desperate, an in-game video solution). 
When the lightbulb pings into bright, brilliant existence, though, Moncage can be truly illuminating. As you rotate, prod and investigate its five little vignettes to line-up matching bits of scenery in one tile to affect the corresponding bit in another, Optillusion's debut game harks back to the best bits from Fireproof Studios' The Room series. It's a beautifully crafted little thing, and it builds on its ideas to create some genuinely standout moments of optical wizardry. If only the story it was trying to tell was half so elegant.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The simple explanation of Sherlock Holmes Chapter One is a game where you embody the nascent consulting detective, aged 21, returning to Cordona, the Mediterranean island where he spent time as a child. It's a third-person puzzle adventure. You gather the evidence, cross reference it all, and then come to a conclusion on the case. Young Holmes returned to Cordona to find out how his mum died a decade ago, and is helped by his best mate Jon, this season's Creepy Watson. Boy, do they get in some scrapes along the way! Bingo, bango, there's yer preamble.
But the complex explanation is that this game, ironically, defies explanation. As I played, I oscillated wildly between thinking, "This is Frogwares' world and we're all just living in it!" and, "What is even happening, what is this, I need a ten-part documentary series that just follows the developers around because they really have a lot of explaining to do."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Morse, the strategy game that teaches you real morse code to win a war, has come a long way since we first wrote about it in 2015. What started out as a free flash game (and a makeshift telegraph key made out of a clothes peg) now has proper 3D graphics, a full team of developers behind it called Aljo Games, and quite possibly the most impressive custom controller setup I've ever seen. When I played the demo at EGX 2021 last month, not only had creator Alex Johansson made an entire telegraph machine for the occasion (together with custom controller designer Katy Marshall), but he'd also managed to source a pair of headphones from the 1930s to really hammer home the idea of being a wartime telegraph operator. 
Obviously, you don't need a pair of 90-year-old headphones to enjoy playing Morse. A modern headset will do just as well. You also don't technically need the telegraph machine either, as there's an onscreen button interface you can click with your mouse. But let me tell you, pressing those morse code buttons in-game wasn't half as immersive as tapping out the commands on a proper dedicated machine, and I wish there was some way Morse could give everyone that experience when it finally launches in full.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Server transfers were introduced to New World last month, letting players boot their characters to a new world. It was implemented as a way to ease queue times in the popular MMORPG, but didn't work completely to plan - it caused a gold duping glitch, and some players have been blocked from transferring altogether. Amazon Games say they're currently working on resolving these blockages, and are planning a second round of server transfers before the year's end, so everyone has a chance to jump worlds.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After pulling Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition's PC edition from sale soon after its Thursday launch, Rockstar returned it to their store overnight. The remastered collection of GTA 3, Vice City, and San Andreas looks a right mess but apparently the reason for its vanishing was they had accidentally left in files they shouldn't have, which include songs that weren't meant to be in the game. Well, it's back on sale now, and it still looks a mess. Hey Rockstar, maybe now consider putting the original versions back on sale too.

In summer, I should be playing vintage games, games which a modern PC can run without even noticing, my silicon frigid. As autumn sets in, I should be playing progressively more demanding games, games that stress my CPU and GPU, pump out more heat. Then in the depths of winter, I'll break out the ugliest ReShade presets and "HD" texture packs I can find, light this tower on fire. But anyway, what are you playing this weekend?

When I see a horse in a field, I think of Torrent the spectral steed. I consider laughing at the end of all my sentences. So yeah, to say my time with the closed network test was infectious is an understatement. But there’s just one detail rattling around my brain I simply can’t shake.
And it’s to do with where I stood in the game’s world. How strong was I? At what point do I take on the big dragon? Should I be here, or over there now? Souls games haven’t traditionally been good at letting you know these things, but Elden Ring felt more confusing. Time to investigate.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Listen, folks, I'm going to hold up my hands and tell you something shocking. I don't get Dark Souls. I've tried to play FromSoftware's much lauded masterpieces several times over the years, but I'm simply not good enough at them to find them enjoyable. No matter how much you try and tell me about the sweet satisfaction you feel after finally beating a boss on the 57th attempt, I've come to realise I simply don't have the time or the patience to see it through. I'm not sure I ever will, either. 
It's the same reason I tend to veer away from a lot of other Soulslike games as well. I never really got on with Dead Cells, for instance, and don't even get me started on Sekiro. But cor, I do also love it when a game proves me wrong. Hollow Knight was the first Soulslike to rekindle my rather begrudging relationship with these games, and now I've fallen hook, line and sinker for Death's Door, the crow reaper sword 'em up from Titan Souls creators Acid Nerve.

Today, you cannot buy it at all on PC. Given that the Internet has been abuzz with screenshots of by how bad parts of the new versions look, it might be tempting to assume Rockstar pulled it from sale for being rubbo. However, they do seem to be having trouble with the launcher software which the game requires. Hmm! Either way, the game is a mess.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jurassic World Evolution 2 is, just like its predecessor, a very capable adaptation of cinema’s most beloved dinosaur franchise. From its music, to the quotations scattered on its loading screens, to the great steaming swamp of Jeff Goldblum voice acting, it’s a solid case study in how a studio can get its money’s worth from an expensive license. And at its heart, of course, is a stable of spectacular dinosaurs.
Using lessons learned from Planet Zoo’s development, which has more or less filled the time since 2016’s Jurassic World Evolution, Frontier have come back with the most beautiful, the most real dinosaurs ever to trudge and honk their way across a monitor. It’s proper John Hammond, spared-no-expense, sunglasses-off-and-gawp stuff. Which makes it all the more painfully frustrating to realise that they’re trapped, once again, in a seriously wonky management game.
