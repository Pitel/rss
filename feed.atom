Last month, we covered a story here on Nintendo Life about a coder named Joshua Barretto who decided to do a custom rewrite of Super Mario 64 for Nintendo's 32-bit handheld, the Game Boy Advance. If you weren't already impressed with this technical feat, this palm-sized project has now shared a new update.
In a new video on YouTube, Barretto has shown off a handful of improvements including a complete rework of Mario's model - with some "improved proportions and better textures". The limbs of Mario have also been made "wider" so that they're easier to see at this low resolution.

Great sci-fi novelists tend to be great short story writers, and Octavia Butler is no exception. “Bloodchild” is the titular story in one of Butler’s collections, and it’s as haunting as anything else she’s written.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The beauty of modern gaming is a wide variety of control options. Mouse and keyboard, a traditional controller, or even a banana, the options are limitless. Speaking of options, if you plan on playing The First Descendant with a controller, I highly recommend adjusting those settings or you'll be spending as much time fighting the controls as the Vulgus.


Break free of the default settings' chains



Normal Button Settings: Default


Movement / Viewpoint Control Settings: Default


Cursor Speed: 29


Vibration Function: On


Adaptive Triggers: On


Invert X Axis: Off


Invert Y Axis: Off


X Axis Normal Sensitivity: 100


Y Axis Normal Sensitivity: 100


X Axis Aim Sensitivity: 50


Y Axis Aim Sensitivity: 30



Screenshot by Destructoid


The default settings for the controller are fine if you're constantly aiming down sights. However, the X Axis turn speed is painfully slow, especially considering how enemies in open-world missions will come from every direction with or without the accompaniment of artillery fire. In addition to adjusting that, the Y Axis should also be increased to provide a more fluid experience.


Disabling the Aim Assist Function is the next step. It might seem counterproductive to do so, but The First Descendant has a nasty habit of pulling your aim towards the center mass of a combatant. This makes things like shooting critical spots and floating orbs harder than they should be. Don't fret too much about becoming less accurate as targeting is still pretty generous. You'll still be able to hit your marks, from the smallest Vulgus gremlin to the biggest Colossus.


Those three changes will make a world of difference during combat. I also recommend turning up the cursor speed to make menu navigation quicker. As for the Adaptive Triggers, that option is entirely up to you. Leaving the setting on won't impact gameplay, but some find the resistance annoying.

The number of Arrancar weapons has also grown, making it the perfect time for a tier list. Here is our Type Soul Arrancar Weapon Tier List ranking all the weapons available to Arrancar.

Arrancar Weapon Tier List


There are now over 10 Arrancar weapons available in Type Soul, each with its own strengths and weaknesses as well as playstyles. While some weapons are better for specific builds, overall this tier list applies to the weapons slotted into most builds. 


Weapons in the S Tier are going to be top of the line for most builds and give you the easiest time in all forms of gameplay, while those in A Tier have specific builds that make them excel. Weapons in the B Tier have strengths in certain scenarios while those in the C Tier aren't really worth using right now as they are under tuned and don't really fill any sort of role at the moment.


Here's our Type Soul Arrancar Weapon Tier List as of July2024:


S Tier



Calibre


Grimmjow's Claws


Neliel's Lance



A Tier



Ulqiorra's Katana


Hollowburden


Wonderweiss's Sword



B Tier



Nnoitra's Scythe


Barragan's Axe


Bloodedge


Harribel's Dagger



C Tier



Tessen



All of the weapons on this tier list are amplified even further by getting Segunda for your Arrancar in Type Soul, so I definitely recommend doing so.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Roblox error code 277 has been an ongoing issue for players throughout the years, ultimately logging them out of the server. It primarily appears for PC users and can sometimes trigger for specific titles. We're here to show you how to fix error code 277 in Roblox to get you back in the game.


Roblox error code 277 solutions


You can fix the Roblox error code 277 with the following methods:



Check Roblox's server status


Ensure that your internet connection is stable


Disable VPNs


Switch to Ethernet


Create a new account


Switch to another device



Players should always check Roblox's server status first since the error code may be tied to a network error. To do this, go to the Down Detector or Roblox Status pages for the latest news. You should also check on your internet connection, as the error code can appear more frequently with an unstable system. Once your connection has been fixed, restart the game to ensure it works properly.

If you're still seeing error code 277 in Roblox, disable any VPNs you may have. This feature can disrupt the connection to the platform, so it's best to remove it, at least while playing the game. You can also play it on another device, like a mobile phone or console, to get rid of the issue. Since the error code tends to show up more with PC, other platforms may be your only option.


Players have also mentioned that creating a new account has solved this problem. However, it isn't the best technique if you've got loads of content in your current file. I suggest using this method as a last resort to save your progress.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Paradox has announced that the console version of Cities: Skylines 2, planned for release in October, is being pushed back to an unspecified time.


“We have not yet met the stability and performance targets we set for the console release,” the statement reads. However, the port is making “slow but steady progress.” They’re expecting a release candidate to be ready for August, and if that is up to standards, they can begin the certification process. However, they aren’t able to give a more specific date.


Cities: Skylines 2 had a troubled release on PC last year. Among the complaints against it were performance issues, but the problems went a lot deeper than that. Over time, Colossal Order has been patching issues, recently releasing the “Economy 2.0” update, which overhauls a lot of the game’s systems. There are still problems, and performance isn’t where it should be, but this feels more like how it should have been at launch.


As much as this is a bummer for console players who want to start their urban planning, I feel like the initial growing pains should serve as a warning about releasing games before they’re ready. If anything, it’s heartening to see that Paradox and Colossal Order are delaying things to ensure that they’re where they want it to be. Maybe a lesson has been learned.


Cities: Skylines 2 is currently available for PC. It is coming to PS5 and Xbox Series X|S sometime later.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At Spike Chunsoft's panel during Anime Expo 2024, the Danganronpa and Shiren publisher announced something a little different. The cozy Japanese hit Natsu-Mon: 20th Century Summer Kid is getting an official English translation and release set for August 6, 2024. 




There have been plenty of cozy games that have come out in recent years, but while the Boku no Natsuyasumi series has been around for quite some time, we haven't seen a mainline game make its way over to the west.


Natsu-Mon features all the talent behind the summer vacation series too, including director Kaz Ayabe and the team at Millennium Kitchen and Toybox. Yasuhiro Wada, creator of Story of Seasons, also worked on Natsu-Mon.




Originally released in 2023, Natsu-Mon follows a young boy, the son of a ringmaster of a traveling circus. The circus has come to a small rural town and it is up to you to do whatever you want during your summer visit. The game is completely open-world; you can climb trees, swim in the ocean, catch bugs, go fishing, and more.


Natsu-Mon: 20th Century Summer Kid will be out for Nintendo Switch for $39.99 on August 6. You can also get it on Steam right now, but it's only in Japanese at the moment; the English translation update will launch on August 6 as well.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Shared FATEs in Final Fantasy XIV are designed to be a challenge to complete. They’re not difficult, but there are a lot of them to do and once you’ve reached Living Memory in Dawntrail, you’re likely to have hit the FATE wall. 


Don’t worry, you’ve only got 66 FATEs to go in order to finish Shared FATEs in Dawntrail. Once you’ve reached Living Memory, you’ll encounter the highest level FATEs currently available outside of the two Special FATEs from Dawntrail. Thankfully, this does mean that you won’t need to level sync, regardless of the level of your chosen Job. 


How do Shared FATEs work in Dawntrail?


Screenshot by Destructoid


To complete the Shared FATEs in a Dawntrail area, you’ll need to complete 66 FATEs. While this seems like a big task, it is at least a little easier than Shared FATEs in Shadowbringers or Endwalker, when 86 FATEs were needed per area. 


Here’s how many FATEs you’ll need to complete in each Dawntrail area to increase your Shared FATEs Rank:



Rank 1 (6 FATEs)


Rank 2 (20 FATEs)


Rank 3 (40 FATEs)


Rank 4



Each FATE completed with a gold rating will reward at least 16 Bicolor Gemstones, although you can get more from boosted FATEs and by killing a Forlorn or Forlorn Maiden in a previous FATE. 


Where is the Gemstone Trader in Living Memory?

To spend all the Gemstones you’ve earned, you can talk to Clerk PX-0029 (X:22.0, Y:37.5). They’re located closest to the Leynode Mnemo Aethetyre on the main, central plaza of Living Memory. 


Here’s everything you can purchase from Clerk PX-0029, along with how much each item costs and which Rank you’ll need to be to purchase:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you’re doing Final Fantasy XIV Dawntrail Shared FATEs in order, once you get to Heritage Found you will have completed at least 264 FATEs. Don’t worry, you’ve only got 132 to go before you’ve completed all of Dawntrail’s FATE requirements. 


Heritage Found FATEs are either level 97 or 98, so you’ll need to complete them with a Job which is at least level 95. Other than that, this FATE grind follows all of the same main rule as previous ones - only FATEs completed with a gold rating will count towards Shared FATEs.


How to Shared FATEs work in Dawntrail


Screenshot by Destructoid


To complete the Shared FATEs in a Dawntrail area, you’ll need to complete 66 FATEs. While this seems like a big task, it is at least a little easier than Shared FATEs in Shadowbringers or Endwalker, when 86 FATEs were needed per area. 


Here’s how many FATEs you’ll need to complete in each Dawntrail area to increase your Shared FATEs Rank:



Rank 1 (6 FATEs)


Rank 2 (20 FATEs)


Rank 3 (40 FATEs)


Rank 4



Each FATE completed with a gold rating will reward at least 16 Bicolor Gemstones. This number can increase depending on bonuses, or whether a Forlorn or Forlorn Maiden appears and is killed during a previous FATE.

The local Gemstone Trader in Heritage Found is called Toashana and can be found in the Outskirts at (X:16.3, Y:9.5). 


Once you’ve reached Rank 3 in Heritage Found, Toashana will have all of the following items available for purchase:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wayforward has revealed that the GBA’s 2005 hidden gem, Sigma Star Saga, is getting ported to modern platforms via Limited Run Games’ proprietary Carbon Engine. On top of that, it will also be getting re-released on GBA.


Sigma Star Saga is an interesting hybrid of RPG and horizontal shoot-’em-up, which aren’t exactly the most compatible for crossover, but Wayforward was able to make it work. It’s sort of like a normal JRPG, but the random battles are shoot-’em-up sequences.


Critics at the time were pretty lukewarm on it. However, over recent years it has found a fanbase in people plumbing the GBA catalog for forgotten gems.


I’ll be honest, I’ve played only about 15 minutes of Sigma Star Saga, but my husband was pretty stricken with it. What sticks most in my memory is the vibrant graphics. The original Game Boy Advance had a really difficult-to-see screen. While the GBA SP alleviated it with its front-lit screen, developers developed the technique of using really bright colors to make things more visible. The most notable examples of this are Metroid Fusion and Castlevania: Harmony of Dissonance. The style was born out of necessity, but it’s a unique aesthetic that stands out today.


While details are somewhat scarce, this seems to be planned as a pretty straightforward port. I’ve played a few of the LRG Carbon Engine re-releases lately, and outside of rewind and save states, they tend to be lacking in bells and whistles. It’s mostly just great to see older games get new leases on life. I just really wish that they’d add in control mapping.


Sigma Star Saga will be released on PC and (unspecified) consoles sometime in 2025. It will also be getting a new physical GBA release via Limited Run Games.

While the studio hasn't historically enjoyed what you'd call mainstream attention, as it's focused on RPGs such as ELEX and Risen, its classic Gothic was hugely important back in the day, and remains a cult classic even today.


This information comes from the Polish gaming website CD-Action, which posted about the purported closure of Piranha Bytes. CD-Action has reportedly been in contact with one of Piranha Bytes' employees, and they told them that the studio scuttled "on the last day of June." 


CD-Action claims that Piranha Bytes' publisher, Embracer, had only provided enough funding to keep the studio afloat until June 2024, and with no further financing opportunities on the horizon, there was seemingly nothing else to be done…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[El Paso, Elsewhere has its sights set on another platform in the not-so-distant future. The next stop for the neo-noir shooter from developer Strange Scaffold is PlayStation 5, which will welcome James Savage with open arms, and most likely in slow motion, sometime this fall.


In addition to a digital launch, physical plans are in store for the PS5 version of El Paso, Elsewhere. The retail release from Nighthawk Interactive will pack the game with a poster and a download code that grants access to a digital version of the original soundtrack. Check out a trailer for the physical version while we wait for a specific date.




El Paso, Elsewhere has been available on PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S since September 26, 2023. The game puts players in the dual-wielding shoes of James Savage, a vampire hunter who has to battle supernatural enemies and the ever-present skeletons in his own closet. It's got a solid throwback aesthetic that further connects it to its key inspirations, namely the Max Payne series. 


The gunplay in El Paso, Elsewhere isn't going to blow everyone away, but its story is something that deserves to be experienced. It's nice that more will be able to do so once Strange Scaffold's dark rumination launches on Sony's console later this year. Beyond that, we still have that film adaptation— which is set to have LaKeith Stanfield in the role of James Savage— to look forward to at some point.

The first thing you need to do is actually go to the event by clicking the event button on the main screen. Once you arrive, you can play minigames to earn tickets. A pack of stickers can then be purchased for 1000 tickets.


Each pack nets you 10 stickers. To get specific stickers, you’re completely at the mercy of luck. However, I can provide a reference for what your odds are for pulling each sticker. The rarest tier (legendary) has a 4% chance of showing up, which, to be honest, isn’t terrible compared to some of the Gacha games on Roblox. However, it could take you quite a few tickets before you manage to land the entire set.

It has now been occupied by Russia for almost two years, during which, as reported by the Associated Press, Russia has demolished, rebuilt and renamed much of the city, overwriting its Ukrainian heritage.
The Disco Elysium-inspired RPG Hollow Home is a memory of Mariupol from just before the war - not a 1:1 recreation, but a collection of details, colours, personalities and some familiar buildings, painstakingly amassed and offered up in the face of erasure. Speaking to me during a very brief demo at Digital Dragons in Poland this year, artist Anastasia Hlyniana called my attention to the plants jutting from old car tyres around the game's isometric map, which she says are a common sight in Mariupol.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The final boss encounter in the Normal difficulty mode of The First Descendant is the Hanged Man, the first fight that requires players to do its mechanics as opposed to just quickly DPSing down the boss. We've put together this Hanged Man boss fight guide to help you beat the boss and provide you with a strategy for the encounter mechanics.





How to beat the Hanged Man in The First Descendant


It's important to note that unless you have insane damage output, the Hanged Man boss cannot simply be zerged down to avoid mechanics. You will have to know the mechanics of the encounter in order to survive and defeat the boss. The primary mechanic for this encounter involves running around with the cube item found in the middle. Here is how to beat the Hanged Man:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There is certainly no shortage of cacti in Final Fantasy XIV. The Sabotender is, after all, the mascot of the Gold Saucer. With Dawntrail, there’s a whole new collection of cacti on the scene and one of them looks like he’s been hitting the gym. 


Of all the minions you can obtain in Final Fantasy XIV, there are some which will drive players to run the same dungeon again, and again, and again. The Tankardtender minion is one of these minions, with a bizarrely cute animation. 


How to get the Tankardtender minion in Final Fantasy XIV

The Tankardtender minion is a possible drop from one of the level 100 expert dungeons - Tender Valley. 


This minion does not seem to have a particularly high drop rate. In order to get mine, I had to run Tender Valley at least ten times (I lost count after that point) and it only appeared once. Thankfully, I was lucky enough to have some good luck on my side and rolled high. 


You’ll need to complete the entire dungeon in order to see if you’re lucky enough for the elusive beefy cactus to appear. That means you’ll need to take down the Barreltender, Anthracite, and the Greatest Serpent of Tural. While this dungeon isn’t difficult once you’ve run it a few times, some of the mechanics might take you by surprise. 


Can you buy the Tankardtender minion in FFXIV?


Screenshot by Destructoid


In short, yes. However, thanks to the fact that it seems to be on the rarer side of dungeon drops, the Tankardtender is currently selling for a high price. 


On my home world, the Tankardtender is currently selling for around a million Gil, so you’ll need to line your coffers if you want to buy it outright.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the new units introduced in Anime Defenders’ update 3 is Pink Demon Witch. Rather quickly, she was singled out as one of the best farming support characters in the game.


As a mythic character, there isn’t much you can do to get her quickly. Most of the time, whether or not you gain her from a pull is entirely based on luck. However, that’s not always the case. Here’s how to do it.


How to get the Pink Demon Witch in Anime Defenders


The only way to get Pink Demon Witch is the same as any mythic unit: through summoning or trading. While summoning usually requires luck, there is a trick that can more consistently net you the Pink Demon Witch, but you’ll need to be determined.


As for trading, that’s not something I can help with. You’ll need to either be ready to trade something …]]></summary>

Beyond Good & Evil: 20th Anniversary Edition is out now on Switch and, by and large, it's turned out to be a successful release for Ubisoft, boasting upgraded visuals from the original alongside some meaningful bonus material. We gave the game an 8/10 in our review, and you should definitely check out our full thoughts when you're able.
Naturally, however, with multiplatform games such as this, the Switch version has unfortunately been subjected to a few downgrades when compared to PS5 and Xbox Series X|S. The most noticeable change comes with the textures: characters, objects, and environments are significantly less detailed than the game's console counterparts, though the use of lighting is at least on par across all systems.

TMNT fans were eating well back in 2023. Shredder's Revenge landed a totally tubular DLC, Mutant Mayhem was one of the franchise's best films in decades, and completely out of the blue Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Splintered Fate popped out of its shell on Apple Arcade.
This roguelike from developer Super Evil Megacorp took the combat-first focus of the Turtles video games that we all knew so well and shaped it into a gameplay loop that the franchise had rarely touched. It bore all the hallmarks of Hades with its difficulty curve, approach to action, and progression system, but with the heroes in a half-shell standing in the place of Supergiant's Greek gods.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer-publisher GungHo Online Entertainment has revealed Disney Pixel RPG, an upcoming 8-bit adventure starring Mickey Mouse, Winnie the Pooh, Genie from Aladdin, Baymax from Big Hero 6, and many more beloved characters. It launches in Japan on iOS and Android devices this September, and is expected to be released in other regions of the world at a later date. 
According to the game's website, Disney Pixel RPG will feature a story about merging worlds, fast-paced strategic battles (with simple controls for mobile and even an auto-play function), customization for your own avatar character, and expeditions that allow you to send pixelated Disney characters out on missions to gather materials and more. Players in Japan can pre-register for Disney Pixel RPG right now ahead of the game's September 9 launch – there's no word on if other regions will be able to pre-register anytime soon, however. 
"The game world that these Disney characters call home have suddenly been invaded by strange programs, and are starting to break down," the story description reads on the game's website. "These previously isolated game worlds have merged, throwing all the characters into confusion. Take on the role of a player of these games and join Disney characters as you embark on an epic quest across multiple game worlds to restore order." 
The game's listing on Apple's App Store notes it will be free-to-play but will feature microtransactions. 
Here's a look at the game's combat: 
And here's a look at the game's avatar customization: 
Disney Pixel RPG launches in Japan on iOS and Android on September 9, 2024. There's no word on when to expect it in other regions of the world.

Popular speedrunning event Summer Games Done Quick took place last week and raised more than $2.5 million for Doctors Without Borders, fielding runners who took on a mix of modern and retro games with various quirky goals or challenging requirements. Like an attempt at getting through Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice without being hit (oh god) and a hasty anti-gravitational swim through the solar system of Outer Wilds but without using the game's spaceship (what). Let us be glad these folks use their powers for good.

Today, though, we're looking at games that didn't get a wide, non-limited physical release. As ever, our staff and contributors vote for their top three eShop games from the list of games we've reviewed, and we give you the winners (and the best of the rest).

Despite its story and extra 10 levels spanning dozens of hours of playtime, that’s apparently been ample time for players to complain loudly enough about one of the expansion’s brand new jobs - so much so that Square Enix have already announced a set of incoming changes planned across the game’s next run of patches.

It's also a genre I'm not overly fond of, preferring puzzles I can sometimes get through by intuition (Spring Falls), brute force (every switch-the-lights puzzle ever), or entering chaos mode (real life).
But I like Isles of Sea and Sky. From starting it almost on a whim, I was playing and figuring things out with zero fuss and no overt tutorialising pretty much immediately, and from there suddenly found that several hours had breezed by without frustration or boredom.

This is on-brand. But, oh no, a wink to real life gambling could be interpreted as a transparent acknowledgement of the gacha genre's psychological claw machine, which is maybe why the developers decided the scratchcard stall should have a sole employee: a very cute dog.

It’s a “fast-paced, juggle-based” 2D metroidvania that stands apart for a couple of reasons. Firstly, your character’s magic sword is also your means of illumination, and the levels are gloomy. And secondly, the whole “juggle-based” thing.

As we celebrated the 50th anniversary of hip-hop last year, it’s now a good time to look back at how ingrained hip-hop music is in gaming, from NBA2K (remember that 2K13 soundtrack curated by Jay-Z?), Mortal Kombat, and Need for Speed, to Cyberpunk 2077 and, of course, Fortnite.

The tune you were whistling dies in your throat as you hurry past into the reassuring shadow of the relatively gnomeless bungalows to either side.

Meaninglessly carrying the weight of the name of the phenomenal success of the Nintendo Wii, it was—by most metrics—a rare miss and a colossal flop. And now you can’t even get it fixed.

Just within the character creator, there are hundreds of options to customize things like hair, body type, what your playable character Rook's face looks like, and so much more. There are also a ton of armor options, too. 
Companions have an armor slot, a ring slot, an accessory slot, and a weapon slot, while Rook has access to even more – a helmet, two weapon slots, a belt, an amulet slot, and two ring slots. A belt having its own slot might sound odd as it's not an armor piece people typically think of when kitting out an RPG warrior. However, the belt is an important facet of Rook's kit.

The parry mechanic is one of the novel additions of the 2023 remake developed by Capcom. Whenever a bolt or melee attack from an infected villager is about to impact Leon Kennedy, you only need to press a button to deflect with the in-game knife. This action grants an opportunity to follow up with an attack on the spot while simultaneously adding to RE4’s original close-quarter smackdown.
Adapting this to the PlayStation VR2 wasn’t easy. Instead of Leon doing a swift animation with just a button press, you need to grab the knife from your chest, lift it up in the air, and match the incoming attack. I…]]></summary>

The first Monaco released in 2013 at a point when Xbox Live Arcade had hit its stride, and there was a new appetite for the type of creative and unique game that existed below the huge budget triple-A, high-fidelity experience. Those kinds of games vastly outnumber the big-budget experiences we are familiar with today, but in 2013 we were discovering such experiences and marveling at their ingenuity. The competition is stiffer for Monaco 2 as it nears release, but creator Andy Schatz is clearly excited to revisit the criminal gameplay saying, “If Monaco 1 is about cat and mouse, Monaco 2 is about complexity and creativity.”

If you’re a gamer, answering those questions requires an additional layer of complexity since we spend much of our free time in virtual worlds. I’ve found myself wondering where our favorite hobby fits into the equation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EA has announced that it will delist three Battlefield titles from the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 digital storefronts at the end of the month. 
On July 31, the PS3/Xbox 360 versions of Battlefield 3, Battlefield 4, and Battlefield: Hardline, along with their associated DLCs, will be removed from sale. Owners of these games will still be able to play their single-player content, but online support for these titles will end on November 7. The embedded announcement post on X also includes a link to an FAQ to answer additional questions about the sunsetting process.

June 28, 2024
While the digital PS3/Xbox 360 versions of these games are going away, Battlefield 3 will still be available to purchase on PC. The same is true for Battlefield 4 and Hardline, and these two titles will also remain on sale for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. The PC/PS4/Xbox One versions will remain unaffected by today’s updates.
It never feels good to see games get removed from sale like this. The reason likely has to do with EA sunsetting online support; it wouldn't be right to continue selling games with popular online modes if that component doesn't work anymore. For those still logging into Battlefield matches on PS3 and 360, you've got a few more months to enjoy the ride.
For more on Battlefield, you can learn about how the next entry is shaping up (which is being made with help by Dead Space remake developer Motive Studios) here.]]></summary>

There is so much you could talk about, so many trails heading off in all directions, but perhaps it's best to begin with the more personal and superficial question that inspired this investigation: how did the open world game get so boring?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The tabletop equivalent of “buying books and reading them are two different hobbies” is surely the difference between buying sexy tabletop RPG manuals and actually dragging your mates on to Discord for a few hours to stumble your way through a module. It’s the dogeared Fighting Fantasy from a carboot sale kid in me, I think. Something about reading worldbuilding snippets organised into numbered tables just hits in a way a novel doesn’t. Such tantalising ephemera is the name of the game in Microprose-published CrossOver: Roll For Initiative. It’s a wave defense where you play match-3 to collect dice, then spend them on fireballs and mace swings to stop tiny bastards from marauding all over your actual character sheet and attacking your stats.

A local court soon clarified that viewers would not be targeted. However, letters from LaLiga's lawyers, demanding 450 euros to prevent legal action, run counter to those assurances. That the letters appear to rely on evidence supplied by Spanish ISPs, indicating which of their customers accessed specific 'pirate' servers, is of even greater concern.

        <updated>2024-07-02T14:35:57.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Stormind Games and publisher Saber Interactive have released a new story trailer for A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead showcasing more of this upcoming first-person horror game's silent alien-infested world. And it continues to look like a scary new addition to the A Quiet Place movie universe. 
Though there's still no release date – it's launching sometime this year on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC – this story trailer reveals more about the state of the world in The Road Ahead. It seemingly begins on Day One, when the aliens, which possess incredible hearing that requires people to remain silent to survive, attack Earth. It then jumps ahead to Day 105, with Alex, an asthmatic college student trying to survive the end of the world with her boyfriend Martin, on the hunt for supplies and more. 
Check it out for yourself in the story trailer for A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead below: 


As you can see, it seems Alex might be pregnant, which, if you've seen the first A Quiet Place movie, can make trying to remain silent in this world quite difficult. We'll have to wait a little longer to find out how the story of A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead plays out because it launches later this year on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. 
For more about the game, watch the reveal trailer for A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead.

The reveal trailer features a look at the hybrid racing game, which allows players to select Autobots and Decepticons, use them in combat encounters in Bot Mode, and race as them in each Transformer's Alt Mode. You can play solo or against a friend.
Check it out for yourself in the Transformers: Galactic Trials trailer below: 


"Evil Nemesis Prime has stolen the Prime Relics, which bestow incredible powers on whoever possesses them," the game's description reads. "Now, the Autobots and Decepticons are in an explosive race to recover the relics – the future of Cybertron is in your hands. 
"Choose your character from icons like Bumblebee, Megatron, and Optimus Prime. Speed into action on battle-race circuits, drift and boost to charge up Energon, then unleash devastating special moves in battle. And use your experience to unlock new skills, characters, and skins. It's the ultimate test of your favorite Transformers' abilities, which will decide the future of Cybertron."

That's not too much of a surprise - big franchise gonna franchise - but still, it's nice to hear.  "It was really difficult to figure out what to do after [Resident Evil] 7," he said, "but I found it. And to be honest it feels substantial."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Fear & Hunger games are pitch-black horror RPGs quite unlike anything else I’ve ever played, taking aspects of JRPG, survival horror and adventure games and distilling them into something I’d be tempted to call bleakly nihilistic if they didn’t display so much evident love for their craft. They also both start with a content warning listing “extreme violence, gore, sexual violence, and drug usage”. You’ll want to take this seriously, and just to be clear: the third item on this list does manifest in some tasteless, albeit brief, ways in the first game. It’s a frustrating blemish on what is otherwise an incredibly evocative and creative series, though you can download a mod to censor the more egregious bits. You will miss the full effect of critically severing an ogre’s massive schlong, however.

I clocked around 10 miles of walking daily and think I saw as much of this massive city as possible with my allotted time. My journey from east to west, north to south of Seoul was only possible by the city’s expansive public transportation network of buses and trains. And while I listened to “Magnetic” by K-Pop group ILLIT more times than I’ll admit (when in Korea, right?) through headphones on these trains and buses, I spent much of my time observing how others spent time waiting for their stop.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, everyone is glued to their phones, myself included. But unlike me, doom scrolling on X (former…]]></summary>

That's extremely evident in the character creator, where players begin their journey in Veilguard. It's easily the best character creator in series history and possibly the most robust I've ever seen in a video game. From hundreds of sliders and options to customize your player-controlled Rook to the ability to pick pronouns separate from gender and more, this character creator speaks directly to the inclusivity of Veilguard – read about my in-depth look at the character creator here.

"Don't turn off your system when this symbol is displayed," goes the message seen often while booting up a game (or some other version of these words). The implication is clear. The saving process is delicate and if you interrupt this invisible ritual the data that's being written to some folder deep in your PC's innards will become corrupted, wrecked, banjaxed. You will lose all your progress, all your precious swords and accomplishments.
But is this true? How likely are you to really suffer a catastrophic loss of shotgun shells? To find out, I decided to spend a very annoying afternoon of turning my gaming rig off and on again during multiple games. Was this a good idea? I don't know. I'm a gamer, not an ideas man.

But no seriously, I think no matter if it's a bit Soulsy or not, my key takeaway is one of relief. There's a lot more substance to back up the style than I thought there would be, alongside it feeling a lot more compact than the behemoth I envisioned in my head. All good signs for the complete package, which strikes me as living up to the crushing pressure of its number one Steam Wishlist spot.

The court ordered Google, Cloudflare, and Cisco to poison their DNS records to prevent these third-party services acting as workarounds for existing pirate site blockades. Cisco's response became evident on Friday when it withdrew its OpenDNS service from the entire country.

I love it despite never having read the Dune books or watched the Dune movies, because the digital version taught me everything I needed to know about Barry Harkonnen, Oscar Isaac, the tall guy from Guardians Of The Galaxy, and their insatiable pursuit of space nutmeg.

Now the board game's first expansion is headed to the digital version of the game, and it's called Rise Of Ix for reasons I definitely understand.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn has gone gold, meaning it should be all but ready for its release on July 18. Developer A44 (Ashen) has also released the game’s PC specs and 20-minutes of raw gameplay footage.
The upcoming "Souls-lite" fantasy action game stars elite soldier Nor Vanek and her furry fox-like companion Enki on a revenge quest to kill the gods of their world. She wields an arsenal of melee, firearms, and magic that can be chained to create stylish combo attacks. Nor Venek also has special traversal abilities to navigate the world, which is being besieged by the angry deities.
We last saw Flintlock during the Xbox Games Showcase a few weeks ago, but you can check out 20 minutes of new gameplay footage in the video below. Set during a later stage of the game, a synopsis adds context to the footage: "Join Nor and Enki as they prepare to step into the deserts of Wanderer’s Rest to take on the personal guard of the god Dukmar. With an entire army hunting for her, Nor will need all of her skills to make it to her eventual destination - the City of Sibyl, where she hopes the gods’ true intentions will finally be revealed."


Here are the game's minimum and recommended PC specs:
Minimum
Operating System: Windows 10
Processor: Intel Core i5-8400 / AMD Ryzen 3 3300X
Memory: 8 GB RAM
Graphics Card: GTX 1060 / Radeon RX 580 (6GB+ RAM)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time reinvented the series in 3D and became its new gold standard, Nintendo followed up with a surreal sequel in Majora's Mask. Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days. Majora's Mask's unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.
Join Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard today and each Friday on Twitch at 1:00 p.m. CT as they gradually work their way through the entire game until Termina is saved.

Created by developers Chibig and Nukefist, it's a "mini open world" game about carrying packages by broomstick while investigating the titular mountain, flying through hoops a la Pilotwings, and savouring the balmy inconsequentiality of an island that reminds me of Super Mario Sunshine. It also now has an early access release date, 21st August, and a charming new trailer.

If memory serves, when they ran that particular trailer I was busy sponging swampwater out my eyes after writing up South Of Midnight, while Nic had become so vociferously agitated over the debut of Doom: Dark Ages that he was no longer solid and tangible enough to operate a keyboard. Graham had long since absconded with Joanna Dark to Immersive Sim Land and Matt, poor Matt, had fallen into a Locust sinkhole while "omnimanouevring" around Black Ops 6. But if one of us had been free and willing we might have had enthusiastic thoughts about this "evolution of JRPGs", in which you must thwart a self-serious artist who is about to magically murder everybody over the age of 32. It is, alas, too late for me.

Infinity Nikki’s big PlayStation State of Play spotlight in May garnered an array of reactions. Fans of the popular Nikki series of mobile fashion games were excited to see the pink-haired fashionista make her triple-A debut. Unfamiliar viewers either dismissed it as an overly whimsical dress-up game or found themselves unexpectedly intrigued by its delightful and unique spin on an open-world experience. I count myself in that third camp. Something about the game’s premise stuck with me, but after playing several hours of a beta version, I’ve gone from admiring Infinity Nikki conceptually to being genui…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Don't Nod Entertainment has delayed its upcoming two-part narrative-driven adventure game, Lost Records: Bloom & Rage, to early 2025. As for why, the team wants to give its spiritual cousin, Life Is Strange: Double Exposure, some space to shine later this year. 
Lost Records was originally due out in late 2024, which is also when the next Life is Strange is set to launch. Instead of competing with Life Is Strange, a series that Don't Nod created with the first Life Is Strange and continued with Life Is Strange 2 before Double Exposure developer Deck Nine took over with 2017's Before the Storm and 2021's True Colors, the studio decided to push to 2025. 
We've made the decision to move the release dates of Lost Records: Bloom & Rage to early 2025. We know you're all excited for both Lost Records and the new Life is Strange game, and we wanted to ensure both have adequate space to shine. The wait will be worth it! pic.twitter.com/PH1O7z3uUy
June 28, 2024
Life Is Strange: Double Exposure launches October 29, and now, Lost Records: Bloom & Rage, which will be released in two parts, will launch sometime early next year. Both games are set to release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. 
In the meantime, watch the reveal trailer for Lost Records: Bloom & Rage, and then watch the Life Is Strange: Double Exposure reveal trailer. After that, check out this extended Double Exposure gameplay trailer to learn how the game will acknowledge the first Life Is Strange's endings.

In the latest episode, they're discussing their (relatively new) Boston studio and how it's spearheading the as-yet-enigmatic sequel to Cyberpunk 2077. There's a lot of middle-managey chit chat but one thing that stood out was one developer's earnest remarks about what he considers some of the sci-fi RPG's shortcomings. 
"I see that we didn't push the envelope far enough in some places, for instance," said Paweł Sasko, Associate Game Director at CD Project RED.  "Like, let's say the homeless crisis... when I look at it, I'm like, we weren't far enough in '77. We thought that we were dystopian, but... we just touched the surface."

Numbers you’d previously shunned for being too high have suddenly gotten smaller, and purchases have shifted categories from impractical to impulsively justifiable. It’s the Steam Summer Sale 2024! There’s no rush, of course. It runs until the 11th of July. Still, to help you navigate the meatily chummed waters of Sales Lagoon, Horace has decided to reward our combined years of service with a crisp ten bob note each to spend on games. We’ve been bringing up the whole “getting paid” thing for ages, so this is a real win for us. Here’s how we’re all spending that tenner in the sale.

I reached the exhaustion point once, and now the DLC's come out, I'm scared I'll reach it again despite the fact I think it's very good. It's interesting then, that FromSoftware's president Hidetaka Miyazaki sees Elden Ring as "the limit" for FromSoftware in terms of project scale (cheers The Guardian for the interview, and PCGamer for the spot). I think it's a great thing, personally.

They’d like to “revisit some of the games we've created in the past and modernize them,” Ubisoft told Ubisoft about Ubisoft.
Elsewhere in the blog, Guillemot repeatedly praises what he sees as the potential for generative AI and how it “can enrich NPCs to be more intelligent, more interactive,” saying this could “potentially extend to animals in the world.” So, look forward to remake Ezio putting glue in his pizza sauce I suppose?

Despite my expectations, I was not prepared for how robust it actually is in Veilguard. Robust enough, even, that BioWare used it to create most of the NPCs in the game, save for mainline characters like companions. Setting hyperbole aside, it is a staggeringly rich creation system, and I look forward to seeing player-created near-replicas of celebrities and monstrous creations that'd be more at home in a horror game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We got our first big look at Concord, PlayStation's upcoming 5v5 multiplayer hero shooter, during a State of Play last month. And last week, we traveled to California to go hands-on with the game. You can read Game Informer's full Concord preview thoughts here, but in short: it feels great and we're excited to play more. 
We have a lot of questions remaining about the game's progression, seasonal content, narrative emphasis, and more, but if the handful of hours we've played of Concord are any indication, developer Firewalk Studios has, at the very least, created a fun and great-feeling shooter. In today's New Gameplay Today, host Wesley LeBlanc talks about his visit to PlayStation's HQ to play the game with Kyle Hilliard and how he felt after checking out 10 of the game's 16 heroes and three of its gameplay modes. 
 Check it out for yourself in the Concord NGT below:

Last month, PlayStation released the first big look at Concord, its upcoming 5v5 multiplayer hero shooter from Firewalk Studios, a team it acquired last year. Though the recent cinematic footage teases something like a single-player, narrative-driven heist game akin to a Guardians of the Galaxy movie, the gameplay reveal that followed showcased the strictly multiplayer experience in a new light. Admittedly, this reveal left me feeling blasé; it looked fine, but not necessarily something I hadn't seen before. However, after playing the game for a few hours during a recent previ…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Albatroz is a "backpacking adventure RPG" that takes place in The Forbidden Lands, a photogenic wilderness "where two worlds converge". You are jaded city worker Isla, and you are here to search for your missing brother, who was himself searching for the mystical mountain of Albatroz - locally known as "the walking mountain", for reasons that you will never guess. There's no combat, and no enemies that I can see - instead, you'll occupy yourself with equipment management, repairing your dinky car, and improving your hiking skills using points earned by doing favours for villagers along the way.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Besides giving The First Descendant the ol’ benchy marks on desktop, I was curious to see how this gleaming looter shooter would run on the less flexing hardware of the Steam Deck. The answer: it didn’t, at first. Luckily, a semi-quick fix was enough to get me in, where I found a game that for all its ray tracing inclinations, is comfortable with life on the Deck. Reasonably. Most of the time.
With any luck, my issue could be purged completely by the time The First Descendant releases on July 2nd. Partly because I was using a technically non-final preview build, and partly because the problem itself was a silly one: launching was blocked by a case of missing Visual C++, something that the Steam Deck’s Proton compatibility witchcraft usually takes care of. Come on, Proton lad, you’re kinda dropping the ball here.
If this ever happens to you, in The First Descendant or any other game, I heartily recommend YouTuber JD Ros’ video tutorial on fixing it. The method boils down to installing the latest C++ versions via the Steam Deck’s Desktop Mode, then adding their executables to the game’s launch options. This worked a treat for me, and I didn’t suffer any further compatibility headaches from there on out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Frostpunk 2 has been delayed. Originally slated to launch next month on July 25, the upcoming narrative-driven city-builder is now arriving on September 20.
Developer 11 Bit Studios sates that following a recent beta, the team wants to take extra time addressing feedback to ensure the best possible experience. In a press release, design director Jakub Stokalski and art director Lukasz Juszczyk issued the following statement:
“Based on the surveys we received after playing Beta, the average rating you gave us was 8 out of 10. We’re super grateful for that! At the same time, it was only a small slice of a work-in-progress, still-growing game. While our backlog is plentiful, it was an opportunity for us to listen to what you enjoyed, and what didn’t quite land yet”. 
“This allowed us to prioritise things better, and bring upfront the features and modifications we were already working on. But we also realised that to guarantee the best possible experience on launch, we need more time to finish the development of Frostpunk 2. That’s why we made the difficult decision to postpone its release to September 20th, 2024”.
11 Bit States that it plans to work on new additions to existing game mechanics and improve the UI and UX, among other things. 
Frostpunk 2 will launch first for PC on September 20. PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S versions are planned to arrive later. We recently played the game, and you can read our extensive preview here.]]></summary>

Metaphor: ReFantazio, the first (going by the colon usage) in a new series of RPGs helmed by Persona series director Katsura Hashino, is no exception. It might be set in a medieval fantasy realm, a relatively straight-laced world of square masonry and parchment maps, but it portrays bread-and-butter RPG fixtures with much the same flair as its strutting high school cousin.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Aspyr Media and publisher Lucasfilm Games have revealed that an enhanced edition of 2002's Star Wars: Bounty Hunter will launch on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC this August. More specifically, it hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC (via Steam) on August 1, and it brings with it updated visuals and controls and a new skin that harkens back to the original game's most infamous easter egg. 
In the reveal trailer, we get a look at the graphical improvements Aspyr has implemented in Star Wars: Bounty Hunter, but the game still retains that 2002 PlayStation 2 and GameCube charm. This re-release follows a limited PlayStation 4 physical run that launched back in 2019. 
Check out the Star Wars: Bounty Hunter announcement trailer below: 


If you're unfamiliar with Star Wars: Bounty Hunter, you play as Jango Fett throughout the story, which itself is a prequel to Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones. 
In the original game, there was an easter egg message that said, "Cash in all bounties to play as Boba." However, cashing in all bounties did not let you play as Boba. To make good on that original promise from 2002, Aspyr media has included a Boba Fett skin in Star Wars: Bounty Hunters you can use after completing the game's campaign. 
Star Wars: Bounty Hunter hits PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC on August 1. 
While waiting for its launch, check out this lengthy gameplay demo of Star Wars Outlaws, another mercenary-centric Star Wars game launching this year. Read Game Informer's Star Wars Outlaws cover story after that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When the ageing, silent character you play in puzzle adventure Selfloss performs a roll, it is a tumble of such poignant melancholy I spent the first five minutes of my time with its Steam demo just keeling about in the starting area. It’s a ponderous, pained roll, creaky and ancient. If it has i-frames, the ‘i’ stands for “I would like to not do that again for at least five minutes, please.” Each time you roll, or sprint, your character wipes beads of sweat from his brow, and you can tell the exertion is genuinely taxing. My man is exhausted. Also, surrounded by fish, both symbolic and literal.

What I hadn't expected was that relying on my own two trotters would be so... revelatory. It's made me reconsider exploration in Elden Ring's open world, and conclude that using Torrent as a taxi service contributes to a feeling of disconnection.

The aim, NEXON tell me, is in motivating players to try out different approaches to combat rather than relying on flat progression.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dragon Age: The Veilguard consultant and former Dragon Age executive producer Mark Darrah has published a Youtube video addressing the question: "why do AAA games take so long?" It's a tidy 25 minutes or so, and gets a fair way into the weeds of a variety of topics, from the current enthusiasm for live service "forever games" over 'finite', narrative-led affairs, to the "misleading" announcement of highly-demanded sequels years before they enter full production, in order to pump up a publisher's brand during a dry spell.
One thing I wanted to fish out and drop on your plate is Darrah's discussion of what he terms "the fidelity death cult" - that is, the desire for ever greater levels of lifelike visual detail and "intricacy".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Capcom has revealed Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster, a remaster of the Xbox 360 game that first launched in 2006. Though the once previously Xbox-exclusive game has since made its way to PlayStation and PC platforms, it remains unclear which platforms this remaster is coming to. And there's no word on when to expect the remaster either. 
Revealed with a short 47-second teaser trailer, Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster looks great, almost more like a remake than a remaster. It's unclear if this is a remaster of the original 2006 game or the HD version of Dead Rising that launched on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC back in 2017. Regardless, we're stoked to head back into a zombie-infested mall with journalist Frank West whenever this remaster launches. 
Check out the Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster teaser trailer for yourself below:

The more than 100 games included at launch was far from stingy, with an extra dozen being added in a free update at the end of last year. Now the collection will add almost 40 more games in an upcoming ‘Expanded Edition’, taking its total game count to over 150.

Truly a proto-Instagram-era Nostradamus. Almost ten years after the first game came to PC, and upsettingly close to 20 years from its debut, the original Dead Rising is coming back in a fresh remaster.

Prior to being the guy who has to push a boulder up a hill for all eternity, Sisyphus was a crafty Ephyran tyrant who used to murder his guests for kicks, and who once fathered children with his own niece in a bid to depose his own brother. Charming! The Ancient Greek gods were outraged both by the king's violation of the norms of hospitality, and by his general insistence on being too clever by half - and I feel a similar way reading the Xitter feed of Bashir "ManliestDev" Kashalo, who is making a game in which you play as Sisyphus after his eventual demotion to Hell's chief stone-shover.

There's no goal, no big number to hit or yammering town mayor to appease. Just some low tempo music, straightforward building controls, and the ability to insert your own cat pictures on the sci-fi billboards.

Sometimes you get to grapple onto a vast robot crab. The first evil alien overlord you fight is named Greg. Not bad, not bad. It’s also, wholeheartedly and unapologetically, a big graphical show-off, complete with multiple ray tracing modes and shinier power armour than if you fed the entire cast of Warframe through an industrial car wash.
Happily, this doesn’t necessarily translate into chugging performance on low-end PCs, or even handhelds like the Steam Deck. But judging from its final preview version, which has just closed prior to the July 2nd release date, feasting on The First Descendant’s finest visuals will definitely tax your rig – and it has its share of technical quirks on the side.

Outside of remasters and remakes, the Super Monkey Ball franchise has been dormant for a decade. At a certain point, it began feeling like AiAi and his crew of monkeys were relics of a bygone era and that Super Monkey Ball was little more than a nostalgic series that has no real place in the modern gaming landscape. Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble disputes that assertion by delivering an experience that’s at once delightful, maddening, and rewarding, but above all else, fun.
At its best, Banana Rumble’s Adventure Mode delivers some of the top stages in Super Monk…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The internet doesn't exist in the world depicted by the film Aliens, though variations of it crop up in the expanded universe. Nor does the idea of a digital society. There's networked communications tech, but it consists of signals between bodies in deepest space, light years apart, of lonely video terminals in cramped dockloader apartments, and of maniacally collaged CCTV feeds of Marines getting their asses kicked, man. There's no ocean of online interactions, corroding the everyday from all directions, just 1-to-1s through boxy, retro-futurist screens that are so dingy and inadequate it feels like Ripley and Burke are peering at each other through a letterbox. Small wonder, given that Aliens was released in 1986, when what would become the internet was still mostly the province of universities and the military.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Publisher Playtonic Friends (the publishing arm of Yooka-Laylee developer Playtonic) and Blossom Tales developer Castle Pixel have revealed Cattle Country, a simulation game that's Stardew Valley meets the Wild West. If its first trailer,  which was revealed by IGN today, is any indication, farming/townbuilding sim fans will want to keep an eye on the game. 
The reveal trailer gives us a great look at what to expect, which includes ranching, treasure hunting, mining, farming, and, of course, romancing. The game is coming to PC sometime in the future, but there's no release date or window in sight. Cattle Country's Steam listing simply says the release date is "to be announced." 
Check out the Cattle Country reveal trailer for yourself below: 


As you might be able to hear, the Cattle Country reveal trailer is narrated by Red Dead Redemption 2's Arthur Morgan, or rather, Arthur Morgan's voice actor, Roger Clark. 
"Cattle Country straddles the saddle of cozy wholesome gaming and action-adventure," the game's Steam listing reads. "Serving up hours of the slice-of-life you'd expect on the frontier – including mining, fishing, crafting, and farming – along with deep-rooted Wild West quests delivering stories of romance, cattle drives, bandits, and robberies."
Here are some Cattle Country screenshots: 

While waiting to learn more about Cattle Country, read Game Informer's Stardew Valley review, and then read about Stardew Valley developer ConcernedApe's next simulation game, Haunted Chocolatier.

After eating some fridge fruit, I prepare an ambush by flicking off the lightswitch, then hide behind a desk.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The one and only Elden Ring expansion we're getting, Shadow of the Erdtree, launched last week and thousands of Tarnished went to the shadow realm to take on dozens of new enemies, bosses, and more. Now, just a few days later, developer From Software has released a new patch for the game that should make Shadow of the Erdtree a bit easier. 
Now live, Calibration Update 1.12.2 targets the scaling of the attack and damage negation given to players with each Shadow Realm Blessing upgrade. Here's what's changed: 
The attack and damage negation has been increased for the first half of the maximum amount of Blessing enhancements, and the second half will now be more gradual. 
The attack and damage negation granted by the final level of Blessing enhancements has been slightly increased. 


This patch should apply automatically like any other Elden Ring update but if it doesn't – the Calibration Version listed at the bottom right reads "1.12.2" if it has – select "LOGIN" and that will apply the latest version of the game. 
The only other thing this update contains is word from From Software on a confirmed bug where the raytracing settings of Shadow of the Erdtree are automatically enabled (if you've previously loaded save data from previous game versions), which is causing framerate issues for some players. If you're encountering said issues, check to see if you have raytracing on or off in the game's system graphical settings. 
This patch arrives after one that hit the game last week, which added new hairtsyles, inventory features, balance adjustments, and more to Elden Ring ahead of Shadow of the Erdtree's launch. 
For more about the game, read Game Informer's Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree review, and then check out this interview where From Software's Hidetaka Miyazaki discusses his approach to difficulty in games.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Celebrity streamer and Midnight Society co-founder Guy Beahm or "Dr Disrespect" has finally responded in full to allegations that he was banned from Twitch for sending sext messages to a minor. In a much-edited statement on Xitter yesterday, Beahm confessed that, yes, he messaged an "individual minor" via the Twitch Whispers chat service in 2017, characterising the messages as "casual, mutual conversations that sometimes leaned too much in the direction of being inappropriate, but nothing more".

Ye olde games shoppe, GOG.com is selling the 1996 survival horror classic as a digital download, so you don't have to go rummaging through eBay auctions to find an original physical copy anymore. It's going for £9/$10. But the smile-raiser is the revelation that its sequels, Resident Evil 2 and Resident Evil 3: Nemesis, will also be getting reanimated in their original polygonal glory.

After customizing much of your Rook's body, including things like a Qunari's horn type and material, for example, with the hundreds of options available in Veilguard, it will be time to pick said class. 


There are three classes to choose from: Rogue, Mage, and Warrior. As the names suggest, each features a unique combat system and plays differently as a result. Though you’ll be performing things like light and heavy attacks using the same buttons, what those attacks do varies based on your class. For example, a sword-and-shield Warrior can hip-fire or aim their shield to throw it like Captain America, whereas a Mage can use that…]]></summary>

There’s something quite special about Still Wakes the Deep. A horror game, quintessentially Scottish through and through, with an atmosphere so tense you could hear your heart pounding as you explore areas, has the right ingredients to make for a memorable experience. Additionally, it’s made by The Chinese Room, the studio behind multi-awarded titles such as Dear Esther, Everybody’s Gone to the Rapture, and Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs. And yet despite these advantages, it still falters when it comes to the fundamental facets.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Netflix has announced that Thirsty Suitors, last year’s skateboarding cooking RPG, has joined its roster of games. Additionally, a few new titles, such as The Case of the Golden Idol, are available now on the service.
Thirsty Suitors, a story-driven turn-based RPG about a woman battling her various exes (to the chagrin of her disapproving parents), launched last November. The surreal experience also features skateboarding gameplay and cooking mechanics, with the entire package garnering positive reviews upon release. The move to Netflix Games means it will become available to play on mobile devices for Netflix subscribers. There's no date for when Thirsty Suitors arrives on Netflix, but it's "coming soon."


As for new games hitting Netflix this month, acclaimed point-and-click mystery game The Case of the Golden Idol is now available. Joining it is Cozy Grove: Camp Spirit, the Netflix-exclusive sequel to 2021’s Cozy Grove, Hearts, and Netflix Stories: Perfect Match. Subscribers can check out all of these games right now.
Netflix Games has amassed quite the library for itself over the last year or so. Other games to become available on the service include Hades, Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy, Oxenfree II: Lost Signals, and more.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed, the remake of 2010’s Epic Mickey, has a release date. Look for it to arrive on September 24.
The game was first revealed during a Nintendo Partner Direct in February. The remake is being handled by developer Purple Lamp and features reworked gameplay (the original was played with Wii motion controls, after all), new brush abilities for Mickey, and a graphical upgrade. A new trailer features a chat with the game's original creative director Warren Spector, who is also involved with this remake, to reveal Rebrushed's Collector's Edition.
For $199.99, this special box is available for pre-order now and includes the following items:
The full game Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed
A 28 cm Mickey Mouse statue
An Oswald the Lucky Rabbit keychain
A vintage Mickey Mouse tin sign
Six Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed postcards
A Collector’s Steelbook
The Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed costume pack


If you missed the original game, it sees Mickey explore a fantasy world called the Wasteland filled with obscure Disney characters, namely antagonist Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, Disney's original animation star who predates Mickey Mouse. The Wasteland has been taken over by an entity called the Blot, which Mickey accidentally unleashed and must now stop. The 3D action platformer sees Mickey wielding a magic paintbrush that can create new objects while erasing others, and Mickey's actions shape his destiny and the game's story. 
Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC. You can read our review of the original Epic Mickey here.]]></summary>

Despite kicking off Nintendo’s fourth-generation console with a starring role in Luigi’s Mansion on GameCube, Luigi's sequel always felt a little relegated. He was downgraded to the handheld platform, but it wasn’t because he delivered a bad game. The video game formerly known as Dark Moon has always maintained a positive reputation, but after the success of Luigi’s Mansion 3 on Switch, it felt like part two missed its time to shine. Thankfully, Nintendo and Next Level Games have brought it to console, and while it’s not without its formerly-a-3DS-game quirks, the…]]></summary>

The latest release, Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree, has attracted attention and, in some sectors of the fan base, controversy for how punishingly difficult it is. The week before the expansion's release, we sat down with From Software president Hidetaka Miyazaki to talk about the notion of difficulty and how the passionate fan base has surprised him over the years.
The Soulslike genre, particularly From Software games, puts an emphasis on death as part of the gameplay experience. When you fight a challenging enemy, it may feel insurmountable, but by taking a studious and persistent …]]></summary>

At the very least, remakes offer a great way to play antiquated or less accessible experiences on modern hardware. 
The remake boom has been in full swing in recent years to the point that it’s starting to get tough to keep track of all the projects in the works.

Though Minecraft has been playable on PS5 for years, it's always been the PS4 version; this native version, however, is a new build of Minecraft made specifically for PS5, which means it will theoretically perform better on the console. 


"Currently, however, the only way to play Minecraft on a PlayStation 5 is by purchasing the PlayStation 4 version of the game," the announcement reads. "By developing a native version of Minecraft for PS5, we'll be able to make the game run more effectively on the PS5's hardware." 
Though Mojang hasn't revealed how long the Minecraft PS5 version preview will last, all are welcome to take part in it, so long as they own the PS4 version of the game. To access it, go to "Settings" on your PS4 version of Minecraft while playing on a PS5 and select "Preview." This preview includes the new Tricky Trials update, so you can venture into the trial chambers, meet a breeze, craft a mace, and more. 
Mojang asks that players who encounter bugs during this preview report it to the developer, and more generally, provide any feedback they might have. 
For more about the game, read Game Informer's Minecraft review, and then check out this story about how actor Jack Black has all but confirmed he's playing Steve in the upcoming live-action Minecraft movie. After that, read about Netflix's animated Minecraft series.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dragon Age 4 was revealed years ago under the name Dragon Age: Dreadwolf. However, with seemingly months to go before the game’s fall 2024 launch, BioWare announced it was changing the name to Dragon Age: The Veilguard. Ahead of that announcement, Game Informer visited BioWare's Edmonton office for an exclusive look at the game for our Dragon Age: The Veilguard cover story. It's here we learned that the name had changed.
I interviewed various Veilguard leads for the cover story, and one of the first questions I asked each of them was, "Why the name change?" Here's what each told me:

Avowed was featured as a major part of Xbox's Summer presentations.

We caught up with Patel and gameplay director Gabe Paramo to find out even more about Avowed, covering what they think of comparisons to Skyrim, how they feel about Baldur's Gate 3, why romance was considered for the game but ultimately not included, and why playing The Outer Worlds may gave you the best idea of what to expect from Avowed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a universe where bagels meet bars, the BAGEL engine has been perfectly toasted, and the ScummVM team is now ready to serve a slice of The Space Bar nostalgia. No, it’s not the key on your keyboard. Rather, it’s a detective story set on a distant planet. Important data has been stolen, and the perpetrator is a shape-shifter laying low in a spaceport dive bar until he can flee off-planet. You play a hard-boiled detective who has the skill to psychically visit bar patrons’ memories to gather clues and narrow down suspects.
This is thanks to the kind people at ZOOM Platform, who provided us with the original game sources to work with. Help us test the game by grabbing a daily build. Read through our testing guidelines. The game features a lot of options to chat around with bar patrons’ and do various actions in the different flashbacks. So we really need people to spend time experimenting and make sure everything works correctly. And please take some screenshots along the way.
If you don’t own The Space Bar, you can try one of the free demos or purchase it digitally from the ZOOM Platform. Testing is also available on Steam via a beta branch, check the Steam announcement for more details.
Now, good luck, and fingers crossed you can find the perp. Otherwise, your bureau chief will have you getting up close and personal with toilet duties for the rest of your career. Oh, and PS: The viewpoints of different aliens differ. For the Bartender, who has segmented eyes, even the original developers felt it was difficult and left in a cheat key of ScrollLock to switch back to a single viewpoint. Feel free to use it if, at any point, the flashback becomes too much for you :)
