        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developers Visual Concepts continue to fix critical issues in NBA 2K25, and Update 1.5 has been announced for the next-gen version of the game.


The upcoming patch, set to go live later today, on September 26, will be released on Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5. It's also going to be released later on Steam for PC users. Let's take a look at some of the bugs that are being targeted by the upcoming update.


NBA 2K25 Update 1.5 patch notes


Like Update 1.3 and Update 1.4, the new patch doesn't have too many changes. That said, the changes listed on the official Discord do include fixes for some severe issues that users have reported in the recent past.



Fixed a number of user-reported hang/stability issues when playing MyCareer or in the City.


Fixed a hang that some users were reporting when loading into a MyCareer save.


Fixed a user-reported issue that prevented advancement during offseason in MyCareer.


Removed the 1.5x REP bonus that was erroneously attached to certain clothing items in MyCareer.


Resolved an issue in MyTeam that allowed for players to be subbed at ineligible positions.



Image via 2K


With the first two fixes, playing MyCareer should be a lot more stable. There have been incidents where NBA 2K25 had either hung or crashed when players logged in to the City. With the latest update, that issue should no longer exist. Similarly, a few items would often give the wrong REP bonus, which has now been removed as well.


Additionally, the developers have also announced that there will be at least another patch before the start of Season 2, and it will contain more bug fixes and optimization procedures.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tactical RPG Triangle Strategy is headed to Meta Quest, Square Enix announced today. The popular RPG is currently only available on PC and Nintendo Switch, but this Halloween you'll be able to manage the battlefield of Triangle Strategy in full VR on the Meta Quest 2 and Meta Quest 3.




I'm still not really on the VR train, but for those who are, Triangle Strategy could be an actual solid entry onto the platform. Even though it's not necessarily a traditional idea, being able to get a birds-eye view of the grid-like battlefields could be very advantageous with the experience Triangel Strategy offers.


According to Square Enix, the Meta Quest version of Triangle Strategy will utilize 360-degree 3D movement on the playfield and supports the Meta Quest's Passthrough feature which meshes the game environment with real-world surroundings to further the immersion even more.


Triangle Strategy is a deep tactical RPG from the team behind Octopath Traveler and Bravely Default. With its stylish HD pixelated art style, Triangle Strategy could be a solid choice for porting into VR. Eric Van Allen reviewed Triangle Strategy when it was released on Switch back in early 2022, calling it "a perfect blend of strategy and RPG" and stating that despite its faults, "Triangle Strategy is ultimately the tactical RPG I was hoping it would be."


Pre-orders are available now on the Meta Quest 2 and Meta Quest 3 with a 13% discount ahead of Triangle Strategy's Meta Quest release on October 31, 2024.

Well, as you can see in the headline, according to Miyamoto this won't be happening. In a recent Game Watch interview, the Nintendo legend mentioned how the company had "no intention" of expanding its museum to other locations.

Earlier this week, Level-5 lifted the lid on its brand-new Yo-Kai Watch concept 'Holy Horror Mansion' and while this "cross-media project" including a "Ghost Craft RPG" looks quite promising at a glance, it's believed something may be going on behind the scenes.
Some fans of the Japanese company have taken a closer look at the initial "teaser trailer", and are now claiming at least part of it features AI-generated artwork. There are already a lot of threads on social platforms like 'X' going into apparent specifics and are now calling on fellow fans to raise awareness.

        <updated>2024-09-25T21:11:08.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of my most anticipated releases of the year, Metaphor: ReFantazio, is set to release in just over two weeks. Ahead of the upcoming launch, Atlus and SEGA have released a massive roughly five-hour demo that covers the entire prologue of the RPG. The demo is available now for PS4 and PS5 on the PlayStation Store, Xbox Series X|S via the Microsoft Store, and on PC via Steam.




First things first, don't worry. With a five-hour-long demo, surely you aren't going to want to play through those five hours again in about two weeks when the full game releases. Thankfully, your progress from the Prologue Demo will transfer to the full release of the game.


It appears the demo is pretty meaty, featuring the RPG's first four dungeons, seven of the over 40 classes, also known as Archetypes and six of the followers that accompany the Protagonist by joining your party.


If you're unfamiliar with Metaphor, think Shin Megami Tensei or Persona set in a new medieval fantasy world that mirrors the contemporary real world. With beautiful landscapes and stylish anime cutscenes, not to mention the same lengthy expansive story that Atlus fans have come to expect from their RPGs. I don't have the time, but screw it I'll find time for this one.


I normally don't bother with demos unless I'm really on the fence about a game, mostly just due to time constraints. But for Metaphor: ReFantazio where I already know I'm going to get it, AND the demo progress carries over to full launch, this is like an early Christmas.


Those interested in checking out the demo now can do so on your respective platform. Metaphor: ReFantazio is set to launch on October 11.

If you're having trouble completing the Weekly Quest tied to it, here's how to defeat an enemy with a cannonball in LEGO Fortnite.

For starters, you must unlock the recipe for the cannon by obtaining Blast Powder from pirates or cowboy skeletons. Collect six Planks and three Copper Bars (Dry Valley caves) to craft it, then start making cannonballs. Build ammunition on the crafting bench using two Granite and one Blast Powder. I utilized these materials to set up a cannon in front of Pirate Camp, but there are better ways to do it.

Originally released in 2020 by Free League Publishing, Mörk Borg has been the undisputed, award-winning breakout hit from the Old School Renaissance world of game design. The tabletop role-playing game strips back the d20 ruleset to its most deadly and fill the empty space with bright and harrowing death metal-inspired art, equal parts vicious and colorful, like its mechanics. 


On September 24th, indie game designer Morbidware announced that they were working on a new video game inspired by Mörk Borg's world, deadliness, and art design. The game is called Mörk Borg Heresy Supreme. The game is a 2D action sidescroller, and the Steam page makes its dark promises of death with a "Roguelike" tag. From what very little of the game we have seen so far, it resembles its peers like Blasphemous and Corpse Keeper.

Mörk Borg Heresy Supreme vows not to forget its OSR roots, featuring RPG elements in the form of stats and rolled skill checks. As the Steam page threatens, "You should always put your life in the hands of a die roll. That's why it's called a die roll." In many ways, the game promises a mix of gory gorgeousness and the knowledge that you will churn through many, many characters before you finally reach the end of its pitch-black apocalypse. 


Mordbidware's previous game was The Textorcist, an exorcism-based bullet hell typing game, which only makes this partnership with Mörk Borg make more sense as I say it. Mörk Borg Heresy Supreme announced a Kickstarter to fund this new digital vision of their surreal hellscape. The Kickstarter goes live on October 1, and the game is said to be released in late 2025.


The tabletop game advises you to burn your book; I suppose now we should burn our PCs too. I just hope they've kept the femur club.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The latest Slayer's Corp update for Anime Vanguards added a handful of cool new items, including the Fortune Catalyst (Slayer) item. However, you'll need to know exactly how to get your hands on it as it doesn't use the previous Gold or Gems currency. Here is how to get the Fortune Catalyst in Anime Vanguards and what you can do with it.


Screenshot by Destructoid


How to get the Fortune Catalyst


You can get the Fortune Catalyst (Slayer) item in Anime Vangurds buy purchasing it from the new Raid Shop NPC, Renguko, located in the Raid Wing from the main hub. You will need to purchase the Fortune Catalyst for either 400 Red Webs, which is easily farmable, or by spending 199 Robux. If you need more Red Webs, you can get them by completing the new Spider Forest raid that was introduced in the 0.5 update.


In total you can purchase up to 999 of the Fortune Catalyst item, as it is a consumable that only lasts a limited time. To buy more than one, simply revisit the Renguko NPC and buy them.


What does the Fortune Catalyst (Slayer) do?


The Fortune Catalyst item currently in Anime Vanguards will increase the chance of acquiring the secret exclusive Renguko unit when completing the final act of the Spider Forest raid. By default, you have a 1% chance of getting Renguko every time you complete the stage. If you consume a Fortune Catalyst item it will double that to a 2% chance. This may seem minor, but think about it this way: if on average it will take you 100 completions to get Renguko, but you can cut that down to 50 completions, isn't it worthwhile?


The only negative is that each time you consume your Fortune Catalyst, it is used up, and only lasts for one completion. Therefore, you will need quite a lot of Red Webs if you want to effectively farm out Renguko using Fortune Catalysts every time.

Caesar King, SOC's defensive leader, has already made waves in the Signal Search, but the second Agent has yet to make her debut. Here's when to expect Burnice White to release in Zenless Zone Zero.


When does Burnice White come out in Zenless Zone Zero?


Based on the Version 1.2 Special Program, Burnice White will be released on Oct. 16, 2024, during the second half of the ZZZ update launch. If you tune into the new Tour de Inferno Chapter, you'll get a sneak peek of her energetic personality and explosive abilities. However, you must progress through the main story, requiring a Senior Proxy Inter-Knot Reputation.

As an S-Rank Agent, Burnice White possesses a Fire ability and an Anomaly role. She also has a signature W-Engine, Flamemaker Shaker, which is perfect for her Anomaly class. Use it with her build to unlock White's Exclusive Skin effect, changing her appearance in a unique way.


Burnice offers a variety of perks to utilize, like her Core Passive Nitro-Fuel Cocktail and Mixed Flame Blend attack. Thanks to her fire skills, you'll inflict significant damage from her flammable Sorched effect. Earn enough Energy to unlock her EX Special Attack, Intense Heat Stirring Method. With this, you'll unleash a ton of Fire DMG using her robust flamethrowers.


Be sure to equip Burnice White with the rest of the Sons of Calydon, providing extra boosts for faction ensembles. There are a few members to choose from, such as Caesar King, Piper Wheel, and Lucy. Lighter, another SOC member, should also arrive soon, giving you more options for Burnice White's build in Zenless Zone Zero.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you've been playing Dress to Impress for a while, you might have noticed that most people play with a more feminine body type. Nonetheless, you can get creative with male model outfits and still reach the top spot on a round's pedestal if your clothes fit the theme.


How to swap to male and female body types in Dress to Impress


You can switch between male and female model types using the mannequins in the Dress to Impress dressing room. Once you spawn in, turn toward the area next to the VIP room to find two statues on the back wall. Using a gender mannequin resets your character, so make sure you do this early in the round so you have time to dress yourself up.


Screenshot by Destructoid


Once you use a male or female mannequin, you'll take on the body type shown in the preview and reset your character. Doing this also removes any makeup, clothes, and hairstyles you have on, restricting you to masculine-styled options. In short, you won't be able to wear any dresses or have flowing long hair as a boy in Dress to Impress.


Admittedly, there are fewer options for male characters than for females. Most of the male-specific outfits also have fits for girls, giving you the freedom to use a more androgynous if you want to keep a feminine body shape. Otherwise, swapping over gives you a noticeably larger body shape and height and more defined muscles that can help make certain outfits stand out more.


Despite these restrictions, guys have their unique hairstyles and masculine facial features that females can't use, which can help spice things up a bit. They also get six-pack abs, which is always a fun bonus. There's no right or wrong answer when it comes to Dress to Impress, especially with how open-ended most themes are.

AI is, for better or worse, one of the hot topics of 2024. It's bloomin' everywhere at the moment. Naturally, there's a lot of speculation on whether major video game companies will implement the technology into their work (and many, it seems, already have), but Nintendo fans will no doubt be delighted to hear that the Japanese firm may be steering its ship in a completely different direction.
In fact, famed creator Shigeru Miyamoto pretty much said as much during a recent interview with The New York Times (thanks, IGN). In discussing Nintendo's ongoing approach with game development, he mentioned AI as a key topic that the company is aware of, but perhaps not interested in pursuing (at least, not in the same way as its peers).

Crystal Dynamics returns as developer, while Aspyr Games takes over publishing duties from the now-defunct Eidos Interactive.


Via PlayStation


Despite the critical and commercial success of the series, Legacy of Kain hasn't gotten a new installment since Defiance in 2003. In that time, the franchise went mostly forgotten and ignored, also failing to receive any ports to newer consoles. But the Soul Reaver remaster means big things are likely in the future for Legacy of Kain.

In a conference call caught by VGC, Ubisoft explained that while the game is feature-complete, the team is working to implement lessons learned from the unsuccessful launch of Star Wars Outlaws.


The company will also do away with the traditional season pass model, saying, "all players will be able to enjoy the game at the same time on February 14, and those who preorder the game will be granted the first expansion for free."


Is Assassin's Creed Shadows being delayed for a different reason?

One such resource that's highly valued is Strange Coins, seeing as they are the main currency for a weekly vendor. Here's how to get Strange Coins in Destiny 2.


Where to get Strange Coins in Destiny 2

Strange Coins can be earned when completing any ritual activity in the game. These include anything from the Vanguard, Crucible, and Gambit sections at the top of the Destinations screen. As for which can give you more, you'll likely see more success when completing random strikes or Onslaught, but you might have more fun with Crucible or Gambit if you're a bigger fan of PvP.


If you're no longer earning Strange Coins, you've likely hit the maximum amount of 99. This means you'll either need to delete your current Strange Coins (which would be silly) or spend them to earn more.


What can you use Strange Coins for?


Strange Coins are used with Xur, who comes to the Tower every Friday until the next weekly reset on Tuesday. His offers include various exotic items, different legendary weapons or armor with specific rolls, and Exotic Ciphers, which can be used to buy Exotic items from Master Rahool or the Monument to Lost Lights. If you're a veteran player, you'll likely want to spend your Strange Coins on an exotic class item roll so you can complete your collection.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Early Access Challenge 2 SBC is here in EA FC 25 Ultimate Team, providing yet another fodder challenge to complete for all. 


Like the first challenge, it's a great opportunity to recycle cards you don't need to get items that could potentially improve your squad. Of course, there's no guarantee about what items you'll get after completing the challenge. Nevertheless, the SBC can be completed for pretty cheap, and the reward pack is valued much higher in Ultimate Team. 


EA FC 25 Early Access Challenge 2 SBC tasks


The Early Access Challenge 2 SBC has only one task, but the conditions can be quite tricky to meet. There are multiple ones, and you'll need to meet all of them in order to get your rewards. 


Task 1 - Early Access Challenge 2 SBC



Max. Nationalities in Squad: 2


Max. 5 Players from the same League


Max. 4 Players from the same Club


Min. 1 Players: Rare


Min. Team Rating: 75


Min. Squad Total Chemistry Points: 31



EA FC 25 Early Access Challenge 2 SBC solutions


There's no one certain way to complete this challenge. Here's one template solution you can potentially use to complete the SBC. 



Raman LW (71)


Kabangu ST (64)


Sears RM (70)


Delgado CDM (71)


Schoofs CM (75)


Lynen CDM (75)


Krueger LB (450)


Theate CB (77)


Boureille CM (76)


Mathias RB (77)


Vandevoort GK (400)  



Potential Costs: 4,200 coins


The idea is to use items from two nations that are based around two to three different leagues. After completing the challenge, you'll get a Prime Gold Players Pack. With six guaranteed Gold Rare items, one of them being rated 82 or higher, this SBC should be high on your agenda.

One such dungeon is the Pit of Heresy, introduced as part of the Shadowkeep expansion. This dungeon might be old now, but when it's the featured dungeon of the week, it's well worth farming. Here's the full loot table for the Pit of Heresy dungeon in Destiny 2.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Marcus Thuram Serie A POTM SBC is now live in EA FC 25, and you can add a new attacker to your Ultimate Team squad.


Thuram has had a sensational season so far, and you can celebrate his achievements by unlocking the special card. At first glance, the card looks like a perfect fit in the current meta. That said, let's take a look at how you can unlock the item and if you should invest your resources at all.

The latest POTM SBC has just one task to complete. There are certain conditions that you'll need to meet during squad submission.

For its price, the Thuram POTM card looks really good. The 3* Skills is slightly disappointing, but 4* Weak Foot is pretty decent. If you have the required fodder and are still looking for a decent striker heading into the first Champions Finals, this card could be an interesting addition.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's time to celebrate Fortnite's seventh birthday by opening gifts, collecting medallions, and flying around the map with balloons. There are also quests involving obtaining these items, but finding a birthday medallion is more challenging than you'd expect unless you get your hands on some birthday presents.


Where to find a Birthday Medallion in Fortnite


The easiest way to find a birthday medallion in Fortnite is to open a birthday present. From September 24 until October 1, birthday presents will spawn on the floor or in chests as legendary-tier items that you can pick up and throw to the ground. Each birthday present has a medallion inside alongside an epic or legendary-grade item. 


Screenshot by Destructoid


The downside is that birthday presents have random spawns around the map. You can find them on the floor in any POI or within treasure chests, but there's no guarantee you'll spot one throughout your match, even if you survive until the end.


How to use a Birthday Medallion in Fortnite


Birthday medallions are different from regular boss ones, as they don't directly buff your character or reveal your location. Instead, they periodically spawn balloons on your back, allowing you to hover in the air when you jump. 


Screenshot by Destructoid


You can have up to three balloons on your back at a time, letting you fly in the air until you or another player pops them. Their strength depends on how many you have, so you can wait until more spawn or release a few if their hover power is too much to handle.


How to use balloons


As balloons appear on your back with a Birthday medallion, you can jump to let them boost your height, release them to reduce their effects or pop them if you want to sabotage others. If you have the Birthday medallion equipped, you'll automatically spawn balloons on your back over time until you're eliminated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The fact that Monster Hunter Wilds is coming out on PC day and date with all the other platforms is excellent news, but there's a hefty caveat in place. Capcom published the full and fairly detailed list of system requirements, and they spell bad news for owners of regular, non-superpowered PCs.


More specifically, everything points to Wilds being effectively a repeat of what's gone down with Capcom's previous RE Engine open-world RPG, Dragon's Dogma 2. On day one, Dragon's Dogma 2 was an infamously poor performer. Capcom did end up pushing out some performance updates not too long ago, but players had to resort to some... questionable actions to get it to behave. According to the official Monster Hunter Wilds PC hardware requirements, we're in for something similar with it, too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[God Of War Ragnarok's PC port followed Sony's largely disliked strategy of requiring players to already have or create a PSN account to link to Steam in order to run. Luckily, we just learned from VGC modder iArtorias came to the rescue by creating a mod called NoPSSDK. It adds a small library that strips the game of its unnecessary PSN requirement.




Screenshot via iArtorias


Sony's strategy could, on paper, make sense for multiplayer games. Still, this measure proved disastrous as it caused Helldivers 2 to lose a devastating amount of players who lived in areas not covered by the PSN's reach. Sony ended up reverting that decision, but a lot of damage had already been done to the confidence we all had in Sony. Concord might have sadly been doomed from the start, but it also had this feature whose innate cumbersomeness certainly didn't help it gain any favor among PC-only players.


This is an especially strange move since we're talking about a single-player experience. Ghost Of Tsushima, the other big PlayStation title recently released on PC, didn't feature this requirement and did just fine. At a time when even EA is starting to let its upcoming big releases roam free on Steam, Sony should totally be taking the hint.


The mod has only been out for a few hours, but it has already been downloaded over two thousand times, in case you're wondering how much everyone dislikes this feature. 


You can now play God Of War Ragnarok on PlayStation 5, and on PC via Steam, and you can download iArtorias' quality of life improvement mod right here at Nexusmods.

There’s still time to get your pledges in, though, and every pledge comes with unique rewards. Every person who pledges even the smallest amount to the Kickstarter campaign will get a key for the game upon release, but that’s not the only perk you can get. 


If you do pledge, you’ll get to pick a key for Steam, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, or next-gen Nintendo. The developers do state that if the next-gen Nintendo isn’t available at the time of release, you’ll be able to change your choice of platform at no extra cost.

It looks very picturesque and, like its predecessor, inspired by the Kurosawa showdowns of old. You can see for yourself in the trailer that acted as the finale of Sony's marketing show.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Look out, it's Spiders. It's fun to write about Spiders, because you get to frighten people for a moment, before they realise you're talking about the game development studio, Spiders. They have just released GreedFall 2: The Dying Land into early access. For those who don't remember the first GreedFall, it was a colonial-styled RPG about landing on the magical shores of another continent and getting into scrapes with monsters and frontiersfolk. This time the story is furthering the fantasy Columbian exchange by putting you in the role of a native who's been uprooted against their will and taken to the "old world". The game's release comes against a backdrop of dissatisfaction in the studio. But workers have gained some concessions in talks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For years, a dangerous and charismatic game has evaded the grasp of many designers. Some say it doesn't exist, that no publisher would ever back it. I'm talking about the one city block RPG that Warren Spector has often mentioned. Sure, we've seen a few usual suspects already - Deus Ex Mankind Divided, Disco Elysium, even Else: Heart.Break - they all grimace in the line-up but nothing ever sticks. Now, out of the gloom of indie development, comes another perp ready to have his mugshot taken. Shadows Of Doubt is an open world detective sim that comes perilously close to being our guy. Its clothes, stature, gait, and fingerprints match the description of what Spector often describes. And yet, if you tilt your head, something is just a little off. The game isn't confined to one block. It's not an RPG precisely. And its simulation has plenty of bugs, jank, and unintentional comedy. But after all this time, in the absence of a smoking gun, shouldn't we just put this guy in the slammer and call the case closed? I say yes, let's. Officers! Arrest this game, it's brilliant.

You might want to chuck in that chickens are basically dinosaurs, because their feet have a "Triassic Flange", a (made-up) term that will make you sound authoritative. If you really want to showcase your knowledge, though, you may want to mention that dinosaurs may have actually fought with large swords lodged between their teeth. Dinoblade demonstrates this! And no, they haven't discovered swords alongside dinosaur fossils yet because palaeontologists have been unlucky thus far. "Soon", you tell them.

They've also "paused" two unannounced games in development, and altered other unannounced games to be more appealing to a "wider audience". Beyond that, they're considering "all possible options regarding our roadmap", which sounds just a touch ominous.

As a heartless individual, I am more concerned with whatever the dog's capable of: general savagery, a howl that replenishes my HP bar, letting me climb atop its glorious mane as it strides across the barren wastes. If it's none of these things, I would much rather have a shiny turret on spindly steel legs skitter besides me.
Nomada Studios have, incredibly, thrust their hands into my chest cavity and given me a blood-pumping mechanism. Having spent some time with upcoming action-platformer Neva (the game) and Neva (the dog from the game), I have to admit: I did enjoy petting Neva (the dog).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ever since Crimson Desert dropped that audacious trailer at Gamescom 2023, I’ve yearned to soak in its medieval Just Cause 2 vibes. It’s hard not to be moved by the exaggerated kineticism of it all – the magic-enhanced swordfights, the jumping off cliffs and turning into a flying shadow monster, the ability to drift horses. Yes. Yes!
I’m therefore somewhat unnerved to report that my enthusiasm has been tempered significantly by actually playing it. I’ve since used all the straws I’ve clutched at to spell out "It’s just a demo" on my floor, but the fear remains that Crimson Desert’s fantastical open-world exploration is going to be interrupted by regular bouts of twangy, unwieldy, unsatisfying combat.

What’s the equivalent of poison? What are experience points and checkpoints called, although you’re going to call them souls and bonfires anyway? I’ve done this many, many times, but on this occasion there was a surprising twist, one which would have notorious pearl-clutching racist HP Lovecraft spinning in his grave. Enotria: The Last Song’s arcane Soulslike language is actually just Italian.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed is a remaster of Disney Epic Mickey, a cult classic 3D platformer first released a decade ago on the Wii. In the original you controlled the titular Mickey Mouse who, armed with a magical paintbrush (wieldable by waving the Wiimote about), could paint or rub out surfaces to solve puzzles. It was the work of Junction Studios led by Warren Spector, best known for being The Deus Ex Guy. No, sadly Mickey could not nano-augment his brush for better target acquisition, nor project laser-guided anti-tank rockets from his podgy white mitts.
And no, Rebrushed doesn't let him do anything of these either. Clearly a missed opportunity. But is it better nonetheless? With an updated look, some added secrets, more moves for Mickey, and controller/M&K support, I'd say longtime Mickey heads will adore this nostalgia trip. For total newcomers like me, I'd say it's a platformer that's certainly charming and clever and wonderfully experimental, but a bit flat in places too.

Writing of the frigid framing of Clockwork Orange’s atrocities, the film critic Pauline Kael asked: “is there anything sadder - and ultimately more repellent - than a clean-minded pornographer?” The lavishly directed and animated universe of God Of War Ragnarok is far from repellent, but it also feels spiritually squeegeed; a world of pulpy violence so chirpy and chaste as to strain belief that the scars that haunt its reformed anti-hero could have ever been inflicted there.

Reported by Bloomberg as a disagreement over attempts to "spin off the video-game division as an independent entity," the details were nonetheless somewhat scant. A  new report from Rebekah Valentine at IGN has since shed some more light on the walkout, which reportedly involved “disagreements over the direction of the Interactive division, chaotic departures, communication breakdowns, and a perceived lack of leadership transparency.” It’s a thorough account of some messy events I recommend reading in full, but here’s a brief rundown.

With my last digital breath, I only wish to inspire a bit more joy in the world, so I’m demanding everyone in the comments give me cat updates whether or not they own a cat. Just make up some lore for the cat you don’t have and tell me about it. Here's what we're all clicking on this weekend.

You can do that anywhere.”
A QA tester with Zenimax currently on union leave, Mitchell joined the Communications Workers Of America (CWA) as a full-time organiser after she and her colleagues formed what was, at the time, the biggest union in videogames - ZeniMax Workers United. Now she helps the CWA do what they did for her and her colleagues at Zenimax: provide support, training, resources and guidance for workers in the videogame industry who have decided, for whatever reason, that they want to unionise.

The major one is that a lot of its quests exist to create distance between places and plot beats. They are overwritten errands such as bringing people lunch or fetching herbs or carrying letters - dessicated, MMO-ish fare, thrust into a moderately enjoyable action-RPG for the sake of incremental worldbuilding and scale.

I think that makes the inclusion of such items as pre-order bonuses for Two Point Museum - alongside Knuckles staff costumes and Sonic-themed interactive exhibits - a pretty strong extra incentive not to pre-order.

But hey, at least the next management game in the growing 2.universe now has a release date: March 4th, 2025.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fifteen months on from its PS5 release, Final Fantasy XVI – that actiony RPG of emo-fringed hack ‘n’ slashing and disquietingly sexy Ralph Ineson characters – is now on PC. Enough time, you’d think, to do a proper job of rejigging it with Windows spanners, especially after Final Fantasy XV’s port got so much stick for its lack of features and performance issues.
FFVXI does make some improvements, adopting a full set of DLSS and FSR upscalers and frame generators, and its mouse and keyboard integration feels generally slicker than XV. Sadly, it’s still no first-rate adaptation, neglecting numerous PC features and giving low-end systems an even deeper kick in the plums. Cutting the quality settings can help, as per the guide down below, but overall performance is so up-and-down than you’ll likely never achieve a perfectly smooth ride.

It’s a turn-based battler with an empire-building component in which you play as several emperors in succession, passing on abilities and knowledge to your heir. In what I consider to be a poetic complementary flourish, you can also pass on save data from the demo to the full game. Look, this is what counts as “poetic” just before lunch on a Thursday.

The developer's next game, Welcome To The Dark Place, is more about hearing. It's an "open-world, auditory text-based adventure" which mostly takes place in pitch blackness.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There have been many durable pirate sites over the years with The Pirate Bay   perhaps the most high-profile of them all. While it has fewer years under its belt, pirate IPTV service Magis TV is under attack from all sides. The latest broadside in Argentina will see the country's ISPs block around 70 domains, but that's just the tip of the iceberg. The Alliance for Creativity and Entertainment has seized a similar number yet Magis TV has somehow managed to stay afloat.

The sidescrolling metroidvania is a rich, expansive, and surprisingly challenging take on a genre typically dominated by indies, and it's precisely the kind of game I wish mega-publishers produced more.

It's also now got a story expansion, Mask Of Darkness, which came out yesterday.

Enter Gold Teeth, a tabletop RPG "of piracy & occult horror" which just cleared its Kickstarter funding goal, and which is designed by Marsh Davies and Jim Rossignol (RPS in peace).

I then combed through several thousand comments below said video, many of which expressed similar longing for the hypothetical Good Old Days, before those wily feminists invaded the medium, transformed every game into a LGBT+ weeping simulator, and threw all the Real Men into a big hole. I did this because I was searching for one particular comment written by somebody claiming to be Matthew Karch, CEO of Space Marine 2 developers Saber Interactive.

This is probably a disservice to the hero of colourful metroidvania Marko: Beyond Brave, who a quick goog tells me may be based on Krali Marko - a popular character in the folklore of Studio Mechka’s native Bulgaria. Folk hero or not, Marko certainly has some heroic facial hair: his moustache floweth so bountifully that it can’t be contained in his character portrait. Extremely powerful of him.

According to EA, it’ll be the “final chapter" in the now-trilogy, following 2019’s Jedi Fallen Order and 2023’s Jedi Survivor.
The existence of the game was first confirmed by Cal Kestis actor Cameron Monaghan, during an Ocala Comic Con panel. “We’re working on a third and we’re in the process of doing that right now,” said Monaghan, which is about as straightforward an affirmative as one could want. It was also double-confirmed this February, following news of layoffs at EA, via Eurogamer.

We've already seen a description for the PC version appear briefly on the PlayStation store (of all places). And earlier this year a snoopy fan of the studio who monitors the backend of Rockstar's launcher found similar game descriptions buried amid metadata. Yesterday, that same practice yielded yet another clue - the game's Steam app number.

The ISPs stress that the current ruling creates "extortionate pressure" that puts innocent subscribers at risk. A separate brief from Boston College Law School Professor Alfred Yen, also urges the Supreme Court to take on the case.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Frostpunk 2 was an ambitious gambit. With survival achieved, and the introduction's excellently sinister advisor whispering evil Tory ideas, the whole city you built in Frostpunk is now just the headquarters for a sprawling expansion effort, and your rule is no longer absolute. Rather than retread the same "prepare for ultra-Winter" ground, your biggest obstacle will likely be your own people, now formed into shifting political parties, and looking outward with colonial eyes. The result is a complicated, laborious survival citybuilder that's two parts compelling, and one part frustrating for the wrong reasons.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I really wanted to like action adventure The Plucky Squire more than I do now, having given its charming 2D to 3D platforming a proper whirl. Yes, it's lovely to look at. Yes, hopping out of a storybook and making friends with an illustration on a coffee mug is cool. And yes, everyone can have a mildly fun time with its puzzles and fights. But that's the problem: who is everyone? At first I thought, "This game is for young kids and that's fine!", given its relative simplicity. Then I hit some puzzles and thought, "Ain't no kid figuring this out".
Then it hit me. It struggles to balance the fine line between being approachable for tiny tots and layered enough for people who've graduated from "goo goo ga ga" to "oo oo aa aa my back hurts". And that's down to how plucky you're allowed to squire at any given time, because it can be surprisingly limited and, sadly, a bit underwhelming.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You can't travel back to the 1980s. But what if I told you it was possible to gently warp your memories of that time? UFO 50 is a kart of 50 games that once existed for an old computer system, all lovingly restored by a gang of coders. The old console, of course, is a fiction. The LX-I never existed. But it's a fun pseudo-history against which to create a grab bag of small games (some throwaway, others mighty) all designed with a distinct 80s look. It's an exercise in adhering to an aesthetic. Like an oil painter working with a limited range of colours, the developers of this bundle have stuck to a 32-colour equivalent of the Zorn palette. Yet play a little of each game, and you start to sense the smirk of chronos. These games aren't stuck in the past, but they are enjoying a holiday there.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Why is every blockbuster video game now some kind of live service game? Speaking as a clueless idiot, the explanation I find most convincing is that it's an attempt to bridge the gap between the returns publishers want from video games, versus how much we're able or willing to pay upfront. "Triple-A" projects now cost exorbitant sums to develop, partly thanks to wider economic inflation, but also because publishers have spent decades teaching players that every sequel has to be More and Shinier. Premium game prices have not risen in proportion, and investors want growth, as they do.
Live service games sneak around this difficulty by dragging out the time we spend playing them. Whether premium or free-to-play, they seek to install themselves as habits by means of regular, planned updates and additions. This is time that can be monetised by way of a subscription model, time in which other products may be sold to you, like skins and paintjobs, and time that becomes a commodity in itself, "engagement", which can be transmuted and exploited to various end. I'm not sure it's ever been expressed this way in any press release boast about longevity, but the unspoken principle/logical extrapolation seems to be that ideally, a live service game should keep us plugged in and plugging away till we die.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Strange Scaffold’s newly released FPS I Am Your Beast is very fun for quite a few reasons, but chief among them is a deep appreciation for the poetry of good videogame violence. I’m not using the big P word just to throw out an overly worthy comparison to something we might associate with craft or beauty, but as a nod toward the game’s playful application of what I previously called ‘a euphoric splurge of murderous game verbiage’ one morning where I had clearly eaten my wordy Weetabix. The way its hurled knives and curb stomps and inexplicable decapitations flow together have an assonant, almost Suessian quality to them.
But it’s also, well, just a bit like Mad Libs. You play as Harding, a man who’s mythical lethality is established very early on. The showing is there in the moment to moment, but the telling is conveyed through cute tricks like how everyone you meet is so deeply afraid of Harding that they loudly keep track of exactly what weapon he’s holding at all times. The Mad Libs comes in through the fact that you can draw Harding a route between A and B, and it’s a given that multiple heads are going to come unstuck from necks along the way. You’re sort of just casually filling in the verbs that seem the most fun to you in the moment. One of the verbs is ‘hornet’. Hornet is a verb now.

Yes, I am the kind of wizard who hurls a bunny rabbit, if there are no boulders to spare.
Happily, it transpires that Proletariat have resurrected their creation and handed it over to posterity in the shape of a free standalone Community Version, available on Itch.io.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In theory, vampires and immersive sims go together as naturally as bats and caves. Immersive sims tend to involve a balance of stealth, acrobatics, raw strength and crafty manipulation, and vampires are celebrated for all of these things. Despite this, actual vampire-themed immersive sims are rare. My list starts with Vampire: the Masquerade: Bloodlines... and sort of ends there. In a devastating betrayal, Arkane Austin's Redfall wasn't an immersive sim but an open world co-op shooter (a not very good one). The much-delayed Bloodlines 2 was recently downgraded from immersive sim to RPG by new developers The Chinese Room. Arkane Lyon's Blade adaptation seems promising, but it's a ways off. 


Here to paper over the immersive vamping gap in the market is Byte Barrel's Trust, "a new first-person shooter with immersive sim elements". It takes place in a world where the vampires are hunted for their blood, which has become an everyday human energy source, used for everything from car batteries to streetlights. The irony! I feel like, in the circumstances, the ideal solution would be for humans to let vampires suck their blood in return for vampires letting humans use their blood for electricity, but that wouldn't make for a very thrilling shooter. Anyway, here's the trailer.

Menace, their upcoming turn-based tactical RPG, will also put the wellbeing of your chosen fighters at the forefront of your mind – along with a dramatic shift from 2D medieval sprites to the fully 3D battlefields of a unruly space frontier.

You're constantly repairing corroded doors and swapping out busted engine parts with cobbled-together technology. But maybe this tinkering was a little too much. Our review praised the game for its "trunk loads of atmosphere" but called the constant need to craft stuff "laborious". If you also felt this, then good news. An update now lets you fiddle the difficulty options a generous amount, say developers Ironwood Studios, making the game easier and bringing crafting needs right down.
Buuut... if you thought the opposite - that the game wasn't hard enough - you can now tick a box that makes hitting yourself with the trunk door kill you stone dead.

In between burrito recipes and hymns to the Fujifilm X100v, this gorgeous toylike art tool's gamely turning stretches of balmy meadow into semi-ruined castles, semi-ruined villages and semi-ruined citadels. 
Dreamy and slightly haunted, it's conjured words like "bewitching" and "spellbinding" in the comments sections, too. It makes sense, really. Tiny Glade's a game about making rustic dioramas and then photographing them. It's not hard to imagine some exiled magical person might live in here among the rocks and reeds and wild heather.

Eliot's The Wasteland and Mad Max: Fury Road - a blend of influences that would typically get you kicked out of the Creative Writing Club for being simultaneously too fancy and too obvious, but the game beyond the epigraph looks pretty swish.
It's "a compact and high-density Metroidvania, with a focus on sequence-breaking and playing things out of order". It uses a square aspect display ratio calibrated to give wizened Game Boy enthusiasts the shakes, and is made up of 200 single-screen rooms that "slot into the larger puzzle-box of the world". Also, you play a thorn witch who looks a bit like 1950s Tinkerbell, with a touch of Betty Boop. Here's a trailer.

The latest update for the physics-based open world build-a-car game introduces a mountable theodolite, which lets you stitch together monorail networks you can then ride about on.
If monorails strike you as frivolous, don't worry. It's more of a Shelbyville idea. And in any case, the theodolite also lets you construct networks of pipes, power lines and rail-less tarmac roads - the ready-salted crisp of the road family. It’s a chonky expansion that, in the words of lead developer Ian MacLarty, has only “scratched the surface of where this new system could go”. I am predicting an eventual pivot into either themepark management or factory simulator.

Twenty hours ago I placed my first manufacturer somewhere around here. Back then it represented the state of the art, hatching me a pristine batch of 1.25 computers every minute - now I’ve forgotten where I put the damn thing, after delving into my factory’s guts to hook that piddly yet still useful batch of old relics up to my main production line. I’m building supercomputers now, and the many manufacturers that make those are hungry.
Something is always hungry in Satisfactory, and that hunger pulls you from task to task in a near-seamless and frankly beautiful daze of ever-escalating industry. It is mesmerising and it is fearsome, and after five years of early access it’s finally complete.

They want to give me a concussion and choke off the supply of video game news to the Maw, which will then manifest fully and bring about an age of darkness. Well, the joke's on you, squirrels, because I used to play grass hockey as a kid and I've been hit in the head by hard round objects a million times over. How else do you explain my choice of career? Anyway, here's a curated list of PC games that are out in the next five days.

"Everybody pays too much attention to and cares too much about Metacritic scores. It's gotten to the point where there's almost a set formula – if you want to get a high Metacritic score, this is how you make the game," Suda51 told Gi.biz.

After consuming four years of Grant's life, the case turned on a fair use defense; under scrutiny of the court, it effortlessly failed to convince on any of the four factors that combine to indicate a permitted, non-infringing use of a copyright work.

The fight was far more complicated than it seemed, as the developer recently explained, with some players finding ways to encode hidden messages in the checkboxes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Initially reported as technical issues, in September 2023 file-hosting platform Uptobox watched as its servers went offline. In reality, they were being taken away due to a criminal complaint filed by Hollywood, Canal+, Apple, Amazon, and other rightsholders. Since then, the owners of Uptobox have turned to the legal system, hoping to salvage whatever they can. On Thursday, a Paris court informed the defendants that their servers will not be returned.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good Saturday, friends! It's finally hitting Autumn, isn't that lovely? The leaves are doing that cool visual glitch where they look nice for once. All pretty and crunchy and satisfying. It's just a shame it only lasts a week or two before turning into mulch on the pavement. Reminds me of a Regina Spektor lyric: "Leaves become most beautiful when they're about to die". And now, inevitably whatever I write below this will be a lie, because I'll actually spend my weekend listening to old Regina Spektor songs, because she's just the best.
But for now at least, let's keep up the pretense that we're not all lying through our teeth every weekend with these posts. Here's what we're all (allegedly) clicking on this weekend!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In V Rising, you're a fledgling vampire on a mission to become absolute bossferatu of a Gothic open world. You get a Diablo-ish combat system, the ability to shapeshift into a spider, and a whole castle to prance around in, crooning at the moon. I like this premise almost as much as I dislike the fact that V Rising is also a survival game, in which you must fell trees and master a crafting system like a common turnip farmer.


What do we hope for when our interest in a game is almost perfectly balanced by our disinterest? We hope that the developers will treat us to a free-to-play weekend, in which our perhaps-unfounded reservations might be strategically offset by the endorphin rush of not having paid any goddamn money. This, V Rising creators Stunlock have now done. The game is free to download and play on Steam from right now until Monday, 16th September at 5pm UK or 10am PST.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Released last year, Mosa Lina is a chaotic 2D platform puzzler full of bombs and frogs and spikeballs and tentacles, all subject to real-time physics. It's an "aggressively random" response to what the developers call the "lock-and-key" philosophy of certain immersive sims. It's also just been Major Updated, with new two player cooperative local and online multiplayer, various quality-of-life tweaks, new recording functionality, and a suite of gameplay changes or fixes to make Larian's eyes water. If you've been holding out for a sim in which "frogs can jump off of other frogs" and "delete that's deleted by delete triggers the delete's deletion as it gets deleted", well, I encourage you to get involved.

Whitethorn Games and North Star Video Games have only come out with a rival: Spray Paint Simulator. In it, you get out your spray painter and "shshshshshs" different colours of paint onto various surfaces. For whatever reason, the universe this takes place in doesn't seem to value brushes or those rolly mops. "No", it says, kicking your brush into the sun. "Spray or nay".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A European consumer advocacy group have published an open letter to the European Union Commission expressing their concerns about video games that make use of premium in-game currencies - aka, make-believe money you can buy with real money, such as Minecoins in Minecraft's Bedrock Edition. 


The group in question are the Bureau Européen des Unions de Consommateurs, or BEUC, who represent 44 non-governmental consumer organisations from 31 countries, and have been around since 1962. They're accusing the publishers of Fortnite, EA Sports FC 24, Minecraft, Clash of Clans and others of misleading people -  specifically children - with their in-game premium currencies, and breaching European Union consumer protection laws. On a press site that summarises the results of various longer studies, they offer the below broad complaints about the practice.
