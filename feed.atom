It's all about Pokémon this week, but there are plenty of other Nintendo Switch games to look forward to beyond this. Coming early next year in January is Fire Emblem Engage by Intelligent Systems.
Ahead of the game's release, Nintendo has release another new trailer titled 'The Divine Dragon Awakens!'. Although there's no gameplay on display, there are some absolutely stunning cutscenes. We also get a much better look at many of characters in the game - including the new hero Alear as well as the old favourite Marth. Here is the latest trailer in all its glory:

Former Namco Hometek game designer Scott Rogers mentioned at the time how disappointed he was with this decision on social media. Fortunately, Bandai Namco has now patched in the original staff credits in the latest game update.

You've got the classics in there like Team Deathmatch and Kill Confirmed, but there are also some new modes to try out like Headquarters and Prison Rescue.

Sony's Santa Monica Studios may have a few projects under its wing at the moment. In a new interview, Santa Monica Studios' Cory Barlog says the studio is currently spread out across a lot of different things.
Speaking to the Los Angeles Times, Barlog says Sony Santa Monica Studio is currently "spread out on a lot of different things." The director declines to specify what those are. But as the LA Times points out, there were rumors of a sci-fi project at the studio that was cancelled. Sony Santa Monica has also helped publish games in the past, like Journey.
Santa Monica Studio just launched God of War Ragnarok. the follow-up to the 2018 God of War reboot. And as Ragnarok director Eric Williams puts it, being the God of War studio isn't a bad thing.
“I remember talking to someone from another game company, where they were trying to get me to leave," Williams told the LA Times. "They said, 'Do you just want to be known as the God of War guy for the rest of your life?' That was your big pitch to dissuade me? Because yes, I kind of do.”
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1wr0DfV73E
Ancient myths and new legends
Considering the studio just wrapped one big game, expecting something new right away wouldn't make much sense. The studio has yet to announce its next project, but that's kind of like asking someone who just finished a marathon about tomorrow's run.
Meanwhile, studio has been clear that Ragnarok is the end of the Norse saga for Kratos and crew. Whatever's next seems like it'll be a new step forward in some way.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cyberpunk's first DLC is right around the corner
Fans of CD Projekt Red's most recent release, Cyberpunk 2077, have been waiting quite some time now to learn some more information about the game's first official DLC: Phantom Liberty. News of the spy thriller expansion was first released back in September via a teaser trailer, and we know it's scheduled to drop sometime in 2023 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S (Stadia is also listed as a platform for release in the official Cyberpunk website's blog post from a few months ago, but I have a feeling that one is subject to change).
While news of a more specific release window is up in the air, we do have confirmation as of today that Phantom Liberty will be paid DLC expansion, but we don't know how much it'll be yet, either. Paying for DLC is something that CD Projekt fans know well (just look at The Witcher 3), and if I had to guess based on precedence, I'd say this new expansion should be somewhere around $20 depending on how big it is. In a comment to GamesRadar+, the global PR director for CDPR, Radek Grabowski, said that the expansions are "traditionally cheaper than full-price games," so at the very least we know it won't be $60. We'll take what we can get at this point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbVKBoDuhZ0
This likely won't be the only DLC we see for Cyberpunk, either, but if you ask me a spy thriller theme is a great place to start. I imagine the adventure will have something to do with corporate espionage, and if we're basing predictions on the past Witcher DLC, there's a good chance we could see new maps and characters, and even get a whole new synth-style soundtrack. I for one will be excited to see what comes next for Night City, especially after the renewed hype for the game from the Cyberpunk: Edgerunners anime.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So yeah, Mr. X, I'm thinking I'm back
The Streets of Rage are headed to the silver screen. Lionsgate has picked up the film adaptation of the beat 'em up Streets of Rage, with John Wick writer Derek Kolstad writing.
This news was reported on earlier this year by Deadline. Today's confirmation sees the Streets of Rage project finding a home at Lionsgate, with Kolstad producing alongside Toru Nakahara. Dj2 Entertainment's Dmitri M. Johnson, Timothy I. Stevenson, and Dan Jevons are also on board, as well as Escape Artists' Todd Black, Jason Blumenthal, and Tony Shaw.
Dj2 Entertainment is important to note, as the company worked on the recent Sonic the Hedgehog film series and is also looking to adapt It Takes Two.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDXY1WRef0Q
Streets of Rage saw a bit of a revival, thanks to the 2020 release of Streets of Rage 4 that went over pretty well. It's a classic in the beat 'em up genre, and it's easy to see how someone behind the John Wick series would gravitate to a property like this.
"When Dmitri first mentioned the idea of cracking a Streets of Rage movie, I was so immediately freaking in," Kolstad said in a statement via Variety. “And to play with Sega? The 10-year-old me is still grinning.”
A new adaptation
This adds another video game to the long list of upcoming video game adaptations. It's become a popular trend, as productions like Arcane and Sonic the Hedgehog have worked out pretty well. Even Cyberpunk: Edgerunners and The Witcher, based off media properties that existed before their game counterparts, saw boosts thanks to their series' successes.
For Streets of Rage? I'm just hoping for some brawling action with the series' best. I could easily see a found-family story about a rag-tag crew of fighters working here. And it's a good excuse to play some more Streets of Rage, too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The long-awaited Pokémon Trading Card Game Live app is now available in beta worldwide on PC and mobile devices after a staggered rollout last month. The successor to the now-defunct Pokémon Trading Card Game Online game has been in the works since its reveal last September. 
For fans of the previous mobile game, TCG Live aims to offer a more polished, robust digital card game experience. You can collect cards either by scanning code cards or purchasing booster packs with digital currency earned in-game by completing quests and working through battle passes.
Players represent themselves with a customizable avatar and can challenge players to matches across the globe. It also sports a much sleeker presentation. Essentially, TCG Live is positioned as the Pokémon equivalent of modern card game apps such as Magic: The Gathering Arena and Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel. Check out the original teaser trailer below.


Since the game is in beta, expect updates to roll out over the coming weeks/months. Pokémon TCG Live can be played on iOS, Android, and is downloadable on PC.]]></summary>

Following on from this weekend's leak, developer Firaxis has officially announced the Civilization VI Leader Pass, which will see the coming months roll out a who's who of famed leaders, dictators, and visionaries to the grand strategy sequel.
The first DLC drop, "The Great Negotiators" will launch on November 21 and will bring with it diplomatic masters Abraham Lincoln (United States) Queen Nzinga Mbande (Kongo), and Sultan Saladin (Arabia). Each leader brings to the table bespoke skills and abilities to help players grow and expand their presence within their home territories as well as in the global political picture.

The remaining five packs, which are yet to be dated, contain the following DLC leaders. All packs will be released by spring 2023.
Great Commanders Pack: Tokugawa (Japan), Nader Shah (Persia), and Suleiman the Magnificent (Ottoman Empire).
Rulers of China Pack: Yongle, Qin Shi Huang the Unifier, and Wu Zetian (All China).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you're on PlayStation, prepare to be confused too
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 just launched Warzone 2.0 (read: battle royale) with the Al Mazrah map, on top of a beta for the DMZ mode. If you're in the mood for more battle royales, it sounds exciting. But of course, it's a AAA game release, so not everything is rolling out quite so smoothly for existing owners.
I went through this process today, and can save you a headache.
[gallery link="file" columns="2" ids="350203,350202"]
If you already own Modern Warfare 2, re-download these packs
So I had Modern Warfare 2 already installed on my PS5, and even though the icon was updated to show Warzone 2.0, it actually wasn't integrated in the game yet.
To rectify this (after trying to frantically locate it via in-game menus), I deleted the entire game and re-installed it. You can also opt to re-install the "Multiplayer and "Warzone 2" packs by managing your game on the home screen. After you re-install the packs, then load up the game, you'll see a completely different launcher (like the one in the above second screenshot).

If you don't, you can find Warzone 2.0 on the PSN or Xbox storefronts
Alternatively, there is a Warzone 2.0 direct download in the PSN/Xbox storefronts.
Search for Modern Warfare 2, and it'll come up with the above icon in tow (the highlighted game). It's simply called "Call of Duty: Warzone 2.0."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Get your skates on
There is increasing evidence that Ubisoft is getting set to make its return to PC's popular digital retail platform, Steam. The publisher essentially left the platform in 2019, choosing to release all of its PC out via its in-house Uplay service and later on Epic Games Store.
The first sign that Ubisoft might be heading back to chez Valve came earlier in November, when a Steam port of Assassin's Creed Valhalla was found lurking in the Ubisoft Connect database. The epic Norse adventure, which first launched back in 2020, will be receiving its final update next month, and thus is a prime candidate for a "complete edition" debut on Steam in time for the holidays.
But Ubisoft's comeback plans were practically confirmed yesterday, when then colorful wheelie racer Roller Champions made a brief appearance on the Steamdb. Initially spotted by known Ubisoft leaker YoobieRE, the free-to-play title swiftly had its status hidden shortly thereafter. But, given the clarity of these two leaks, it seems highly likely that we can expect an official announcement from Ubisoft soon. As a somewhat-struggling multiplayer-centric title, a new Steam port could only serve to widen the Roller Champions audience and benefit the game as a whole.
Ubisoft is currently working on Assassin's Creed Mirage, which will launch for PC and consoles in 2023.

God of War has been around for 17 long years, and with Ragnarok still fresh in everyone's minds, we figured it was worth taking a look at a few of the best games in the series.
Here's a list of the top three God of War games to date!

3 - God of War Ragnarok (2022)
I've had access to God of War Ragnarok for weeks at this point: which is solely a statement on how much I've been absorbed with it, and nothing more!
Ragnarok is a fantastic modern action game that builds upon a a lot of what the 2018 laid down, while adding its own twists, turns, and character moments. There are some points that feel rushed, and give credence to the suggestion that this Norse story should have been a trilogy: but it does stick the landing, and has a…]]></summary>

I've been playing Overwatch on and off basically since day one, so I've seen the game through all of its changes, for better and for worse. With every nerf, rework, and new hero drop, the game has evolved so much since 2016, and to many fans, it's not even worth playing anymore, especially after the Overwatch 2 relaunch. Despite my qualms with the series (of which I have many, including recently getting hit with a ban from the entirety of Season One after a series of unfortunate disconnections from competitive matches), it's still one of my favorite and most-played games to date. That being said, the roster is filling out fast, and I don't find myself too thrilled with the most recent additions.

A new, free title update is on its way to Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak. The expansion to Monster Hunter Rise picks up some more monsters, as well as new layered weapons, Follower potential, and more in Free Title Update 3.
Free Title Update 3 rolls out on November 24, for everyone who owns Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak. The expansion's currently available, on both Nintendo Switch and Steam.
This update includes, of course, more monsters. Plenty of big new baddies will be available to hunt, including the giant Chaotic Gore Magala. They seem like a bad time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzuXd1C4AZM
If your friends are too intimidated by the hunt, you can always call on Followers. The AI companions had events like Follower Quests, which let the various NPCs of Monster Hunter Rise team up with you for a special trek.
Free Title Update 3 will let you bring Followers along on Master Rank and Anomaly Research quests as well. And hunters might need the help too, as new monsters are being added to the Anomaly Research quests.
Breaking dawn
Weekly event quests are in store too, which will have unique rewards for hunters who finish the quests. And if you want even more cosmetics, there's some paid DLC in store for Sunbreak.
New layered weapons are on the way as paid DLC. Layered weapons are essentially weapon skins, which modify the appearance but not the stats of a given weapon. These particular layered weapons are stuffed versions of popular Monster Hunter monsters. Whoever turned the Khezu into a weapon is a creative and devilish mastermind.
Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak's Free Title Update 3 goes live on November 24.

Ubisoft and Riot Games are looking into training artificial intelligence to tackle bad behaviours within in-game chat, a research collaboration they’re calling Zero Harm In Comms. Ahead of their announcement today, I put some questions to Ubisoft La Forge’s executive director Yves Jacquier and Riot’s head of technology research Wesley Kerr to get some more insight on the joint project, and ask them exactly how their proposal will work.

Nestling in among all the talk of Mother Crystals and summons is a comment from writer Kazutoyo Maehiro that players will get to control another character than just our boy Clive. It sounds like you’ll only get a short while to step into this other, as yet unnamed character’s shoes, however, as they’re only playable in the early game.

Splatoon 3 is about to get a whole lot busier with its new "Chill Season," unveiled this week. But thanks to some new tweets, we now have a better idea of what the patch will usher in.
Coming on December 1, we're getting more stages (I stress more, because some are old), including the Brinewater Springs arena; as well as more weapons, like the Splattershot Nova. The latter is really interesting based on the description: "Its power won't blow up a planet or anything, but you can fire all day long without affecting your aim. Splat speed ahead!" Both can be viewed in the tweets below.
While we knew another season was upon us, the high-energy Pokemon Splatfest and this new season are a great shot in the arm for Splatoon 3. While the game had a lot going for it at launch, a lot of folks were a bit tired of it a month in. For me, Big Run could be the crown jewel of the update/Chill Season: which allows players to swap the standard Salmon Run map for a rotating selection of core multiplayer levels (beginning with Wahoo World).
Hopefully more of these types of updates are on the way. The frequency likely won't change, but at the very least, the team can supplement them with surgical quality of life changes and tweaks to build on the foundation that's already there.
Here's a look at the Splattershot Nova

And here's Brinewater Springs, the new Splatoon 3 level

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So. Funny thing about our RTX 4080 review: I sort of don’t have time for it. We are amidst the busiest few weeks in PC gaming hardware for at least four years, with major product launches all round (from its rival Radeon RX 7900 XT to Intel’s 13th Gen CPUs) and a neverending stream of other components and peripherals that still need appraising. Also, I get the impression that if I don’t do more Black Friday stuff, senior ReedPop figures will show up at my flat and start taking my fingers with chisels.


Still, there will no doubt be potential graphics card upgrade-makers looking at the RTX 4080 to see if it’s more of a palatable purchase than the RTX 4090. That vanguard of Nvidia’s next-gen Ada Lovelace architecture is by far the most powerful GPU I’ve ever tested, and introduced a very cool new feature in DLSS 3, but with prices starting £1679 / $1599 it’s just not a sensible option. And since I did have an RTX 4080 show up at the last minute – Asus’ customised ROG Strix GeForce RTX 4080 OC Edition – I can at least provide some quick benchmarks and initial thoughts as to whether it’s a better deal.

Phil Spencer has offered up some new information as to why his company decided to shelve plans for a streaming-only edition of the Xbox platform — The console, codenamed "Keystone", had been in development at the studio but work was officially halted back in the summer of this year.
The Keystone project had hoped to develop an Xbox alternative that would neither feature a disk drive nor would allow for digital game downloads, and instead would run purely as a device to stream and play games live from Xbox's huge library of current and classic releases. Development had reached the prototype stage, with an early edition of the would-be tech appearing in the background of Spencer's office during a previous Xbox presentation.

Back in October 2022, a Pokémon GO event called the Shuppet Spotlight Hour took place, with a "special" surprise for people who participated. Niantic ended up cancelling this special surprise at the last minute, but not before those in the GMT +13 time zone in Australia and New Zealand saw it, which meant that the surprise was spoiled.
The surprise was supposed to be an encounter with the Pokémon Zorua, but a bug meant that Zorua would take its moveset, CP, and height from your Buddy Pokémon, allowing some trainers to catch a very beefy Zorua indeed. In response, Niantic removed the ability to actually use or trade the Pokémon, and cancelled the surprise for everyone else, although the Shuppet Spotlight Hour event still went on as otherwise planned.

With every improvement and addition that each new mainline Pokémon entry brings, there are a handful of features that remain unchanged since the launch of the franchise more than 25 years ago: the ability to heal up at a Pokémon Centre, the appearance of the "technology is incredible" guy, and — of course — the option to give your beloved Pocket Monsters nicknames.
During the first few generations of Pokémon, the notion of giving each and every one of your partners its own unique nickname might have seemed reasonably doable. Now that we're heading into the ninth generation of the franchise with Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, however, there are near-enough 1000 of the beggars to keep track of, so it got us thinking: Do players still go to the effort of nicknaming them all?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Shoot that poison arrow...
Capcom has released the first significant DLC drop for its survival horror multiplayer title Resident Evil Re:Verse — Focusing on smash-seller Resident Evil Village, the first roster addition sees the coming of Hound Wolf specialist Tundra, as well as a creepy new map from the dilapidated town itself.
Emily Berkhoff, better known by her call-sign "Tundra", is one of the mysterious officers serving within Chris Redfield's BSAA unit, Hound Wolf. Loyal to the cause, Berkoff administers her duty with cold, ruthless calculation. Berkoff rose through the ranks of the DEA to join the BSA as a drug and poison specialist — a skill which, as Tundra, she uses to deadly effect in the violent confrontations of Resident Evil Re:Verse.

The new map, simply titled "Village", focuses on the town square and its ominous Maiden of War centerpiece. The icy air and brutal, ragged stone environment will test the killing skills of even the most hardened mercenary... erm... Re:Verser. Offering wide-open areas of conflict, as well as plenty of waist-high cover, Village should offer tactical engagement options for all play styles.

In addition to the arrival of Tundra and Village, two classic character skins have also been made available for purchase. The skins reflect series veterans Chris Redfield and Jill Valentine as they appeared in 2009's Resident Evil 5, with Chris rocking his boulder-punching biceps, while Ms. Valentine dons her sleek, night-black bodysuit — sans gross, mind-controlling parasite. A new Premium Pass is also available for purchase, which includes tier reward skins for Leon Kennedy and the delectable Ada Wong.
Resident Evil Re:Verse is available now on PS4, PC, and Xbox One.

Drinking too much wine and playing the piano badly and getting chased out of a hotel lobby is easy — most of us could do it — but it takes a degree of talent to sound entertainingly rubbish.
Likewise, Goat Simulator 3 is an expertly janky game about being a silly little goat and running around causing mischief. It’s a dumb, open-world simulator in which bugs have been promoted to features. Your goat is a horrible little kooky guy who mostly interacts with the environment through the medium of headbutts and licking. They’ll occasionally be catapulted into the sky by a spasmodic police car, or have their head irreversibly enlarged by a special machine, or bleat so hard at a beanstalk that it vanishes into thin air, but even during the most chaotic moments things feel entirely under control. As though the invisible hand of a very, very tired QA tester is always on the tiller.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It goes over basically everything
A Pokemon Scarlet and Violet recap video just launched on the Japanese Nintendo YouTube account; and spans five minutes of general footage that showcases pretty much every major element of the game.
Although the voiceover is in Japanese, you're getting a ton of footage either way, and the gist is easily communicated.
Pokemon Scarlet and Violet feature recap:
The clip starts with an overview of some of the key members of the game, as well as another close-up look at the starter trio
We then move into the two legendary Pokemon, who also serve as your motorcycle/mount, which can drive up mountains and fly
The recap transitions into multiplayer, showing off how multiple people can join your game (but only for a brief moment)
Then we get another look at the three "core" storylines: which you can tackle in any order (as a reminder, it's Victory Road [trainer battles], Path of Legends [an explorer-themed questline], and Starfall Street [the antagonistic faction similar to Team Rocket]
There's a short montage of new creatures
The video then shifts into the Terastallize mechanic, as well as raids with multiple trainers/players
The ability to take photos wasn't widely shown off before today, so if you're interested in the more chill/social elements, tune in around 4:30 for some extra footage
Pokemon Scarlet and Violet are due on November 18, and will continue the "dual" release model following Pokemon Legends' single release. I'm mostly on board, but I hope that the "open world" truly is open, and has a lot to do.
[Update: Nintendo has provided an English version of the trailer as of the week of November 16: which you can watch below.]

Developer Player First Games has detailed what to expect in Season 2 of MultiVersus and it looks to be packing quite the punch. Following the inclusion of Rick Sanchez and Morty Smith from Rick and Morty near the end of Season 1, it seems classic cartoon character Marvin the Martian will be next to join the roster. 
"New roster additions are incredibly exciting, so we figured we'd give you a bit of a tease of one of the new characters who will be joining the MVS roster in Season 2," a blog post about the new season reads.

Remember print gaming magazines? Although there are a handful that are still active and enjoyed by enthusiasts to this day, it's safe to say that the medium is a shadow of its former self, with the rise of the internet making countless print outlets all but obselete.
Still, what's great about the internet is you can find a ruddy boatload of print magazines that have been uploaded and archived over the years, just waiting for your eager eyes to scroll over their glorious pages. One such example is Nintendo Power, a dedicated gaming magazine from Nintendo of America (and later Future US) that ran from 1988 to 2012. Thanks to a group of talented archivists working on a project known as 'Retromags', all 285 issues are now available to download on Archive.org.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sale news from you-know-know
The dedicated king of PlayStation Plus leaks, Dealabs author billbil-kun, has suggested that the black-and-blue brand is preparing to offer a meaty 25% discount on its range of PS Plus paid subscription services — The discount is expected to arrive as part of the forthcoming Black Friday madness.
According to the veteran PS leaker, PlayStation users will be able to pick up 12-month PlayStation Plus Essential, Extra, and Premium subscriptions at a quarter of their original price, provided that they are bagged between November 18-28. As a quick refresher, Essential offers monthly free titles and online capabilities, Extra throws in access to a catalog of rotating titles, while Premium users also receive access to the PlayStation Classics range, as well as exclusive demos and trials.
With a 25% discount included, PlayStation owners can expect the following prices in the rumored offer:
PlayStation Plus Essential (12 Month) - $44.99 / €44.99 / £37.49
PlayStation Plus Extra (12 Month) – $74.99 / €74.99 / £62.99
PlayStation Plus Premium (12 Month) – $89.99 / €89.99 / £74.99
Admittedly, in financially tough times such as these, 80 buckeroos for a gaming subscription is still a pretty hefty ask. But if you're the type of player to burn through games with reckless abandon, then having access to a constantly rotating catalog of releases across 2023 will, ultimately, pay for itself.
Of course, there is no official word the deal is definitely happening. But, given Dealabs consistent accuracy when revealing PlayStation Plus titles, this Black Friday discount rumor can probably be filed under "concrete".

You can expect 18 more leaders spread out over six DLC pack releases between November 21st and March 2023, 12 of whom are new leaders. Another six will be “new takes” on existing leaders from previous games in the Civ series. The Leader Pass’ existence was leaked by accident last week when promo art for the DLC appeared on the mobile version of the Civ website, before it was removed.

The face of Pokémon GO was forever changed with the release of the Pokémon GO Plus wristband - a way to catch 'em all without even needing to get your phone out of your pocket. Since then there has been a Pokédex-worth of imitators, all keen to bring something new to the catching game.
None more so is this the case than with PhotoFast's 247 Catcher - an auto-catching device which stakes a pretty big claim in its ability to catch Pokémon consistently for 120 hours (that's five days)! The device is supposed to perform these catches at a pretty speedy rate too, with it taking an estimated 6.5 seconds on each wild encounter.

Perhaps the toughest pick though is what version to go with. You might already have a running theme when deciding which version to go with, but if not - it can be a tough choice.

Blizzard's new free-to-play hero shooter Overwatch 2 had all sorts of issues when it arrived on Nintendo Switch and multiple other platforms last month, and unfortunately, it's still dealing with some problems.
In the latest development, Blizzard has made the tough decision to delay a major mid-season cycle patch just hours before it launched, due to a "critical issue". It hasn't revealed what exactly the problem is.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I got the music in me
A few months ago, the Recording Academy announced it was adding five new categories to its annual Grammy Awards, including a new category solely for soundtracks to video games and other interactive media. A video game grammy award has been a long time coming, given how the medium has produced some of the most outstanding musical scores of the past 20 years. Just yesterday, The Game Awards announced its top picks for Best Score with Xenoblade Chronicles 3, Metal Hellsinger, Elden Ring, God of War Ragnarock, and A Plague Tale: Requiem making the cut. None of those games are up for the inaugural video game soundtrack Grammy, but that probably has to do with release scheduling and other requirements that might not have been met.
Instead, the five games nominated for Score Soundtrack for Video Games and Other Interactive Media are:
Aliens: Fireteam Elite (Composer: Austin Wintory)
Assassin's Creed Valhalla: Dawn of Ragnarok (Composer: Stephanie Economou)
Call of Duty: Vanguard (Composer: Bear McCreary)
Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy (Composer: Richard Jacques)
Old World (Composer: Christopher Tin)
Your guess is as good as mine as to what Old World is, but there are few recognizable names on that list. Bear McCreary is perhaps best known across the industry for his work scoring films like Godzilla: King of the Monsters, as well as video games like God of War and God of War Ragnarok. Austin Wintory is also a name you should know, given his work on titles like Journey and The Banner Saga trilogy.
To find out who takes home the inaugural video game Grammy, tune in to the Grammy pre-show on February 5, where this award is most likely to be handed out.

Blizzard has been dealing with all kinds of bugs since the release of Overwatch 2, and in a few instances, have had to remove certain characters from the game to ensure players don't use exploits in the game. Mei is the most recent hero to disappear from the roster, and now she's not expected to return for another couple of days. That's right -- the mid-season patch has officially been delayed.
While the original announcement stated that the delay would be indefinite, an update as of today at 4:00 pm PST let us know that we only have to wait until the end of the week, because the new ETA for the patch is this Friday, November 17 at 11:00 am PST. Phew, don't scare us like that, Blizzard.
https://twitter.com/BlizzardCS/status/1592594536215158786
The patch will include "balance changes, bug fixes, including those that affect Mei," as well as "core content updates." The delay will also impact "the delivery of Overwatch League Viewership Incentives & Perks from the Postseason matches during the period between Oct 30 - Nov 4, along with the rotation of cosmetics in the Overwatch League shop." The daily and weekly challenges also reset today like normal, along with the "standard shop refresh."
Thankfully things aren't as bleak as they originally appeared, because the game never feels the same when any of the heroes are missing. After Bastion was pulled a few weeks ago for balance changes as well, the internet was flooded with memes, including some hilariously edited missing persons (omnics?) posters. I'm a bit torn about Mei's disappearance myself -- on one hand, I kind of miss the chaos of having an unhinged Mei player on my team, but I definitely don't miss getting and frozen, walled off, and icicled to the head. Regardless, a two day wait is nothing, and our favorite Arctic scientist will be returned to her rightful place soon enough.

The NieR series has crossed over into the worlds of PUBG, Soulcalibur, and Final Fantasy XIV. And now, NieR also joins the cameo ranks of Ubisoft's Rainbow Six Siege.
Ubisoft revealed today that a NieR cosmetic bundle is making its way into Rainbow Six Siege, arriving on November 21. The bundle isn't the only one on the way, either. A stinger at the end teases more to come, with 2B's boots and this tagline: "A YoRHa soldier is approaching... Glory to mankind!"
Looks like we'll learn more on November 21, when Ubisoft reveals the entirety of its next season, Operation Solar Raid. There, according to Ubisoft, we'll get more "NieR goodness" for Siege.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D13DlspkIvE
NieR and dear to our heart
The bundle shown off today is for Maverick, an Attack operator with a blowtorch. The set looks like it includes a cosmetic skin based off the brother Nier's appearance, rather than Papa Nier. I do like the design of the guns, as it's reminiscent of the black-and-gold aesthetic of the Shades. Grimoire Weiss is included in the bundle too, seemingly as a weapon charm.
As I mentioned before, this is hardly the first NieR crossover. Both the original NieR and NieR: Automata have crossed over into other games. In some cases, like Final Fantasy XIV's raid series, they even contain some additional details for fans.
I doubt Rainbow Six Siege will hold any deep lore tidbits, but I can't rule it out. It's a goofy and enjoyable crossover though, and one that made me fondly reminisce on series director Yoko Taro's response in our latest interview with him.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you have a Game Pass subscription, I don't see why you would buy a game between now and the end of the year. Earlier this month, Football Manager 2023 came to the service, a game so all-consuming it barely leaves time to sleep. Now Microsoft have announced the remaining games to arrive in November, and as expected it includes the year's remaining big release, co-op shooter Warhammer 40K: Darktide, as well as several indie darlings.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Major capital investment already secured
Sharon Tal Yguado, a media executive who has formerly worked for companies Amazon and FOX on a variety of smash-hit network shows, has announced the opening of new game development studio Astrid Entertainment.
The remotely-operated studio is yet to announce its workforce, but has seemingly already entered pre-production on its first release — believed to be a multiplayer-centric title. Tal Yguado has already successfully secured a "seven-figure pre-seed investment" from a party of powerful investors including Netease, Tower 26, and Stardom Ventures, which will be used to get Astrid Entertainment off to something of a major headstart.
"I love developing rich worlds and watching millions of people engage and build communities around them. We are seeing a new generation that wants something different. They enjoy walking into evocative worlds that give them freedom, let them hang out with their friends, explore, discover and create their own stories," said Tal Yguado in a press statement.
"I am incredibly lucky to have found and partnered with like-minded visionary game developers who are already pushing boundaries in this medium. We can’t wait to announce our incredibly talented gaming leadership team. Soon!"
Tal Yguado, who has previously been named one of the three most influential media executives in Hollywood, has worked a plethora of roles in televisual entertainment, partnering with various networks and having a hand in the production of shows such as The Walking Dead, The Boys, Invincible, Fleabag, Jack Ryan, The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, and The Lord of Rings: Rings of Power.

The amusingly titled "Deep Dive" video, (running just short of four minutes), focuses on the many adventurous aspects of Forspoken that are both directly entwined with the game's central narrative or appear as fun little extras and/or mini-games.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[How’s it hanging?
Trailers, screenshots, and previews of A Little to the Left paint a picture of a tidying game about making things neat – and a cat interferes and cats are nice. That’s not inaccurate, but there’s a lot more going on in Max Inferno’s first game. Presenting you with one-screen scenes of real-life objects like books, batteries, and cleaning products, the game invites you to get organising. The simplest asks are to just make a drawer neat, or straighten some pictures, but it soon becomes more sophisticated, launching into magical realist daydreams of how shadows and stars might be arranged to satisfy some sort of imagined rule set.
And it’s the imaginary nature of the rules that surprises most. Re-assembling a torn picture has a clear and obvious objective, for instance, but what is the right way to line up some pencils? Shortest to longest? Yellowest to purplest? Pointiest to bluntest? There’s no one right answer, so the game will usually accept whatever is your personal intuition – then shock you with the fact that there were other ways of seeing what seemed certain.

A new hero joins the lineup of Marvel's Avengers at the end of the month. Bucky Barnes, the Winter Soldier, will arrive in Marvel's Avengers on November 29.
The 2.7 update will add the once-frozen warrior to Avengers as a playable hero, alongside the Cloning Lab Omega-Level Threat. Bucky will also have his own chain of missions, which will reward an iconic outfit once completed.
The Winter Soldier will be voiced by Scott Porter, who also lent his voice to Bucky in Lego Marvel's Avengers. As for his playstyle, he's apparently an "assault-focused hero" who loves to do damage.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDBojdBAjXU
The Omega-Level Threat of the Cloning Lab carries on the MODOK storyline. It's an endgame encounter meant for a squad of players to tackle, and will require Power Level 175 to enter.
Avengers, assembling
Bucky is the latest hero to join Marvel's Avengers, since Jane Foster's Thor took the field earlier this year. That brings the total hero count up to 12, if counting the PlayStation-exclusive Spider-Man.
It's also been a strange year for Crystal Dynamics, the team behind Marvel's Avengers. The studio was recently bought by Embracer Group, alongside Eidos Montreal and Square Enix Montreal. The latter would soon be renamed to Onoma before getting shut down.
Meanwhile, Marvel's Avengers is still carrying on. The team says that updates past 2.7 will keep on revising and tuning heroes, as they've been doing with past patches. And Crystal Dynamics is also working on the next installment in the Tomb Raider franchise, too.

Leading the back-half of November are two entries out today, Somerville and Pentiment. The former is an Inside-like sci-fi thriller, while the latter is an excellent historical fiction mystery from the crew at Obsidian. I highly recommend making time for it this month.
The Game Preview version of Dune: Spice Wars rolls onto PC Game Pass on November 17. The 4X strategy game set in Frank Herbert's Dune universe is one way to get your maneuvering and strategizing fix.

Update : We've got some friend-shaped critters coming to the Pokémon Center in the US, UK, and Canada "very soon", according to the official Pokémon Twitter. The company has just dropped a short little clip of the upcoming Pokémon X Squishmallows collaboration, and we'll be able to buy one in the near future.
Pikachu and Gengar are the only two 'mons confirmed to be making the jump to round, cuddly, and incredibly soft form so far, nor do we have a price for them yet, but listings should be appearing on the online Pokémon Center stores in the near future. The toys were revealed at San Diego Comic-Con earlier this year.

New villains are always emerging and new heroes are always swooping in to stop them. Crystal Dynamics is taking this same approach with its game starring Earth's Mightiest Heroes. Marvel's Avengers launched with six playable characters, but that's far from all the heroes we'll be able to take control of when it's all said and done. Crystal Dynamics has said that all playable characters will be added at no additional cost, but additional upgrades for those characters could cost money.
Check out all the characters you can play as in Marvel's Avengers, as well as all the heroes still to come.

We are still a little way away from Black Friday, 2022 (25th November) though that hasn't stopped Nintendo UK from getting into the sales spirit as it has today announced that its eShop sale will start this Thursday - 17th November. Yep, nowhere near Black Friday itself.
The announcement came in the form of a tweet from @NintendoUK and it specifies that the sale is for the eShop only - so don't go expecting any discounts on Mario LEGO just yet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nominative determinism in action
Publisher Thunderful Games has announced that it has entered into an agreement to acquire British independent studio Jumpship. The acquisition makes Jumpship the 10th studio to join the Thunderful portfolio, and the first purchase since the establishment of new CEO Anders Maiqvist.
“The level of intrigue that Jumpship has managed to generate for its debut title shows you that this is a team with a deep artistic vision," writes Thunderful Games' Agostino Simonetta in a press release. "Adding to our already diverse and accomplished roster of talent under the Thunderful Studios’ umbrella is an important part of our strategy to build strong internal IPs. We look forward to supporting the team at Jumpship to harness their skill for building impactful narrative-driven experiences as they continue to create fantastic titles within the Thunderful family."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_lPMatv07o
Founded in 2017 by Chris Olson and PlayDead co-founder Dino Patti, Jumpship's first release, Somerville, launches today on November 15 and concerns a young family's encounter with an intergalactic invasion. Much like previous PlayDead hits Limbo and Inside, Somerville sports a heavy atmospheric slant, evocative and stylistic visuals, and light platform and puzzle-based challenges.
Dino Patti also spoke of their excitement and confidence in the Thunderful acquisition.
"I feel really good about the partnership with Thunderful and what it will do for Jumpship," said Patti. "I have known Agostino for a very long time and we have built a strong relationship of trust. We’ve been talking about this possibility for around a year and, over that time, I have only become more convinced that this is a great opportunity for Jumpship and Thunderful alike."
Somerville launches today on Xbox, PC, and Xbox Game Pass.

Isn't it terribly boring that so many ranked lists of Zelda games, whether it's "best music" or "best hairstyle for Link" or something else, end up dominated by Breath of the Wild? Well, not this one, because today we're ranking the very best dungeons in the Legend of Zelda series, and for once, BOTW doesn't have much to add (although it looks like Tears of the Kingdom might).
But rather than pointing out Breath of the Wild's dungeonlessness, let's instead celebrate the brilliant design, visuals, and music of our top 15 favourite dungeons over the past 35+ years, as well as the creative bosses, settings, and items that set those dungeons apart from all the rest.

I expect it was cheap in some kind of daily sale. Perhaps I was hungover, and hoped a small treat would ease my aching head. I vaguely recall booting it up once, perhaps a decade ago, and getting no further than its main menu. Painkiller was destined to rot in a digital purgatory of my own design forever, an unassuming icon that I would scroll past on my way to reinstall Destiny 2 for the 12th time without giving it a single thought. That is, until Valve finally sent me my Steam Deck.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just when I thought I had my top 10 games of 2022 sorted, Obsidian release Pentiment, forcing me to shred my former list and grab my quill and ink for a rewrite. It’s an odd pairing on paper - a detective thriller about a string of grisly murders set in the quaint countryside of 16th-century Bavaria - but, surprisingly, this coupling is a match made in heaven. 
Its captivating story of conspiracy and murder is as rich and dense as its setting, and it's clearly made by a passionate team who have a deep love for the period. Playing Pentiment feels like riffling through the painterly pages of a medieval manuscript, but instead of finding the written gospel of saints and sinners, there are tales of angry farmers, greedy landowners, church scandals, religious turmoil, and murder. Fundamentally though, it's a historical tale about faith and truth, and the lengths that people are willing to go to preserve them.

The best stories in video games manage to fuse narrative, art, and gameplay in a way that elevates all three. Pentiment, the latest from Obsidian Entertainment, is a perfect example of this, telling a deep, complex story about religion, truth, and history in the form of a book, which the player experiences as it’s being written. Despite a few sections with inconsistent pacing, it’s a must-play for fans of adventure games.
Pentiment tells the story of traveling artist Andreas Maler and his time spent in Tassing, a fictional town …]]></summary>

Will Twitter's technical infrastructure collapse after the staff who know how to maintain it are fired, leaving the would-be God Emperor of mankind rotting upon his failing Cobalt Throne? Will Twitter shut down due to financial collapse? Will people simply leave Twitter? All I know is, I'll miss the Twitter bots which go down to collateral damage, the automated machines which tirelessly post art, poetry, jokes, stories, and probably dog photos.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo and Game Freak have released an overview trailer for Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet, showcasing more than five minutes of new footage. 
Hot on the heels of the official release of Pokémon's ninth gen this Friday, this overview trailer will get you prepared for your upcoming journey through Paldea. Veteran trainers will recognize a lot of what the trailer is breaking down, like how your journey begins by picking a starter, but this overview trailer also breaks down a lot of the new things happening in these games. This includes the fact that you can tackle the gyms in any order, freely explore Paldea, and infiltrate the Team Star bases scattered around the region. 
Check out the Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet overview trailer for yourself below:


As you can see, this trailer is packed with lots of new looks at characters we'll meet in Paldea, new Pokémon to catch and party up with, and more. 
For more about the game, read Game Informer's hands-on preview with Pokémon Scarlet or watch our video about it here. Check out these new details about the first Tera Raid battle, an early-purchase Pikachu, and more after that and then read about Greavard, a new ghost-type dog in the games.

The official Pokémon UK Twitter is dedicating the whole day to our brand new trio of starters — Sprigatito, Fuecoco, and Quaxly. These were first revealed in February 2022 in Scarlet & Violet's debut trailer, and we've been weighing up our options ever since. Look, they're just all so darned cute!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s late evening. A family is dozing in front of the TV, their dog at their feet. Suddenly the TV turns to static, the ground shakes. While the parents peacefully sleep on, the toddler stirs. Oh no. I instantly expect nothing but the worst for the toddler, seeing whose game I’m playing – developer Jumpship was co-founded by Dino Patti, himself co-founder of Playdead, the studio behind Limbo and Inside. Both aren’t exactly known for treating their child protagonists well.

Somerville begins with a peek into the life of a young family and their dog. Everyone fell asleep watching TV on the couch, but the curious toddler gets themselves into some inconsequential trouble, forcing the family into their routine. Both the child and dog need to be fed and the kitchen needs to be cleaned, but something feels off. In an explosive moment that truly caught me by surprise, the family is suddenly reckoning with an alien invasion. An intense, often scary adventure kicks off from there. When Somerville hits its highs and fires on…]]></summary>

Factorio is daunting in the extreme, and I remember bouncing off it the first time I tried. Thank goodness I gave it a second chance. Building up a gigantic world-spanning, atmosphere-destroying factory slowly and methodically over dozens of hours is probably my favourite singleplayer experience in games.

Their reasons for the delay have been detailed in a lengthy Steam post, but it's mainly good news: after receiving tons of feedback from their recent demo, the devs are now looking to expand the game's scope and spend more time working on its futuristic dirigibles and such. They also released a new teaser trailer showing some customisable airships from the game, too.

The game brings out the worst in me on the regular, as I turn into a spittle slinger who screams into their fist after hitting the tiniest ledge or fighting an awful, awful boss. Frontiers is a janky beast - a mess. Yet, it's a lot of fun when you're mindlessly collecting stuff and sliding on rails and listening to excellent drum and bass tracks. It's a playground of the best and worst kind, so if you'd like a test of patience with your precious spare time, then you simply can't get any better than this.

So far I am finding it, you know, fine, by which I mean it is good and fun but also almost exactly the same as 2018 one, right down to the tension between Kratos and his son Atreus. Their dynamic seems to have largely pressed the reset button so they can do a character growth again, with the differences so far being that Atreus is now taller and his voice has broken, Kratos doesn't call him "Boy!", and also he won't shut up under any circumstances.

At EyeLife's Flat Eye stations, why stop at getting milk and snacks when you can also pick up a whole new stomach, liver and other assorted organs? You'll find them on aisle five, right next to the surgery booths. Perhaps you'd prefer a quick medical checkup instead, though? After all, your tailored biometric predictions for the day looked a bit dodgy earlier, and goodness knows you're not going to wait to see an actual doctor about it.
Afterwards, why not escape for a bit and treat yourself to an immersive VR experience? They've got everything from hour-long fantasies to ones that last days, or even weeks. Your choice. And if you're short on time, you could always just give yourself those happy memories by sitting in their mind-altering MemoryMachines for a couple of minutes. Just don't forget to steer clear of the big recycle chambers. I heard something terrible happened to a dog who wandered into one recently, and the owner went absolutely ballistic. And watch out for the GentleSleep pods, too. I've only ever seen the clerk take long black sacks out of there and stick them in the incinerator, and the smell was awful.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nvidia DLSS 3 is arguably the single most interesting thing to emerge from the RTX 4090 and RTX 4080 GPU launches. Even with, I’ll concede, some limits: whereas previous DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling) versions have been available to any GeForce RTX graphics card, DLSS 3 is currently only usable on these RTX 40 series models. Or will be, once the RTX 4080 goes on sale on November 16th. Yet having tested it out on the RTX 4090, I’m convinced it could be as big a deal as the cards themselves, especially if you have a high-refresh-rate gaming monitor.

        <updated>2022-11-14T13:12:14.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The end of Fortnite Chapter 3 is upon us as Epic Games has revealed that its finale event will take place next month. 
More specifically, the finale event will take place on December 3 at 1 p.m. PT/4 p.m. ET. This news was revealed through a title card teased at the end of the Fortnite Champion Series, which took place over the weekend, as reported by Eurogamer. You can see the title card at the top of this story, if you're curious. 
Unfortunately, that's all that Epic Games teased in terms of the end of Fortnite's Fracture era. As for what's in store for Chapter 4 or what this finale event might play like, that remains unknown. Fortunately, we don't have to wait too much longer, though, because the event begins in just a few weeks. 
If it's anything like previous Fortnite chapter finales, then expect huge PvE battles across the island, plenty of spectacle, an exciting conclusion, and of course, some downtime as the game prepares to launch the next chapter.

Managing the last group of people alive on whatever world they inhabit has me questioning my every decision like I’m cutting wires underneath a bomb.
It’s a relief then, that Floodland is a bit more chill than some of its city-building contemporaries. Gone are the humanity-ending threats like Frostpunk’s great Winter storm, forever bearing down on you and periodically tightening its grasp around your neck. Here you have a simple group of stranded civilians looking to pick up the pieces in the aftermath of an apocalyptic flood.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Standing here, I realize that this Super Replay will be a cut above the rest because we’ll be slicing and dicing in Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance! Join us today on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central to enjoy two hours of what will be a full playthrough of the cult favorite action game streaming weekly each Friday. You can also catch up on previous episodes by visiting our new Game Informer Shows YouTube channel or watching the embedded episode below. 
Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance serves as a sequel/spin-off to Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots that puts cyborg ninja Raiden at the helm. Instead of sneaking around in boxes, players eviscerate foes in fast-paced, stylish action courtesy of developer Platinum Games. Since its launch in 2013, Revengence’s action and absurdity have garnered it a passionate internet fandom, but I have a little secret: I didn’t think the game was all that special when I played it at launch. However, years of being inundated with internet memes and being told my opinion is incorrect has inspired me to give Revengece another look. Will I acquire a new appreciation for the game nine years later? How many watermelons will I slice? You’ll have to tune in to find out. 


Join me, Marcus Stewart, and Blake Hester as we revisit Raiden’s beloved solo adventure. If you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes. You’ll also be granted entry to the official Game Informer Discord channel, where our welcoming community members, moderators, and staff gather to talk games, entertainment, food, and organize hangouts!]]></summary>

        <updated>2022-11-11T18:47:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Remedy Entertainment has announced a new deal with publisher 505 Games to co-develop and market Control 2. The news also provided insight into the sequel's development status. 
According to a press release, Control 2 (once known as Codename Heron) is currently in the concept phase, being built in Remedy’s proprietary Northlight engine. The game will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. Remedy will publish the PC version while 505 will handle the game’s console releases. Control 2 has no release window, but Remedy did release a piece of concept art, posted below. 
The press release also states that Control 2’s development budget initially sat at 50 million euros. Remedy and 505 will equally split marketing and development costs, as well as revenue generated by its release. Remedy retains full ownership of the Control IP, however. The press release also reveals that the first Control has sold over 3 million copies since launching in 2019. 
“We are excited to deepen our cooperation with Remedy and continue the success story of Control together,” say Rami and Raffi Galante, co-CEOs of Digital Bros Group/505 Games. “... Control is the biggest investment 505 Games has ever made, so it has a special place in our hearts. We are grateful to the whole player community that has made Control such a long-lasting and loved game, and are even more excited to bring out Control 2.”
This announcement was first teased last June, when Remedy and 505 revealed plans for new triple-A Control experiences. That same update revealed an upcoming multiplayer spin-off title known as Project Condor. Earlier this year, Remedy also struck a deal with Rockstar to develop remakes of Max Payne 1 and 2.]]></summary>

The news broke this morning with BTAS co-star Diane Pershing, who voiced Poison Ivy, posting on Facebook that Conroy had passed yesterday from an illness, later identified as cancer. Warner Bros. has since confirmed the news. 
"Very sad news: our beloved voice of Batman, Kevin Conroy, died yesterday," Pershing writes. "He's been ill for a while but he really put in a lot of time at the cons, to the joy of all of his fans. He will be sorely missed not just by the cast of the series but by his legion of fans all over the world ... RIP, friend."

It’s set in Depression-era America, a time when many folks were having their assess kicked by the economy and manifest destiny. The game is about these people, specifically travellers and nomads who wander the country in search of answers. Migrant workers, preachers, poets, folk healers, Dustbowl refugees, and even men with wolf’s heads make up this cast, and it’s your job to meet these strangers and collect their stories.

Said anomaly fills with new sea creatures from all over the world every time it's visited, and possibly building-sized terror beasts and ancient merfolk, but Cobra's sure it'll all be fine, so in you go, mate. It's certainly pretty down there if nothing else, and Dave the Diver (game) is, if nothing else, a rare game that makes the usually tedious water level a bit of a treat to wander round in.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Obviously, I wouldn’t be here if I didn’t believe in the pleasurable side of PC hardware. Building a PC (or even just swapping out a component) can be a series of lovely little tactile moments: the peeling-off of plastic wrapping, the K’nex-like click of a graphics card slotting into place, the soft whoosh of the fans on a first successful boot. Great stuff, and of course, that’s all before games start coming out of it. What’s not to like?
Oh, reader, so many things. So many, many things not to like. Gaming PCs are still only computers, after all, and computers break, often and for reasons that may be invisible to the most intensively trained eye. Introduce this volatility to a line of work that involves handling a lot of sometimes heavy, usually expensive equipment, and enjoying those little pleasures will eventually come at a cost. Namely, time spent dealing with arcane troubleshooting practices and the occasional spot of minor personal injury.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Harvestella is a JRPG. This may seem like an incredibly obvious thing to say about a role-playing game from Square-Enix, but it’s the most important thing to know going in. Billed as a life sim RPG, and with a title that evokes farming, you could be forgiven for expecting something along the lines of Harvest Moon or Stardew Valley, but with more monster biffing. Instead, Harvestella sits firmly in the epic quest camp, with your adventuring being supported by your rural activities.
Anyone looking to build a pastoral paradise is going to be sorely disappointed, as the farming elements are somewhat rudimentary. Even calling your property a farm is a bit of a stretch. Even after a few upgrades, my plot is more of a large garden, maybe an allotment, if I’m being generous.

It's now been officially announced with Devolver as publisher and there's a reveal trailer below.

        <updated>2022-11-10T20:31:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dragon Age: Absolution is coming to Netflix on December 9. A new trailer provides a deeper look into the adult animated series' premise and new heroes. 
The story centers on Miriam, an elven mercenary and former slave tasked with stealing a powerful and dangerous artifact. When the heist goes awry, the situation escalates into a larger fight for survival for Miriam and her friends. Set in Tevinter, the show features an original cast of heroes and, potentially, some old favorites (the characters at 0:45 look a lot like Cassandra and Leliana). Check out the trailer below. 


First announced during Netflix Geeked Week in June, Dragon Age: Absolution’s cast includes Kimberly Brooks (Miriam), Matthew Mercer (Fairbanks), Ashly Burch (Qwydion), Phil Lamarr (Roland), and Josh Keaton (Rezaren). The series consists of six 30-minute episodes. 
Though steeped in Dragon Age lore, it remains to be seen if the show has any connection to the upcoming Dragon Age: Dreadwolf. Absolution is far from the only video game adaptation Netflix has in the works. The CG-animated Sonic Prime also premieres in December. The streaming giant also announced a live-action Gears of War movie and its own animated series.]]></summary>

Beyond our coverage of Street Fighter 6 in the latest issue of Game Informer, issue 351 also includes a deep dive into Tchia, and the unusual trip where we learned more about the game.  
Tchia is created by the development studio known as Awaceb. Awaceb’s founders grew up in a small French territory east of Australia called New Caledonia, and this debut game from the studio is inspired by their childhood there. I visited New Caledonia in September, and joined the team from Awaceb to learn more about the culture, peoples, and geography that make it such a memorable place.  
Check out the new issue to discover more about the trip and the game.
Our video below features a small part of the lovely Tchia soundtrack alongside glimpses of video taken during the trip, as well as gameplay footage of Tchia.  


Tchia is set to release in early 2023 on PS5, PS4, and PC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I toyed around with this intro a lot, because I didn’t want to start with a super pessimistic bang. But, for lack of a nicer way to put it, I’ll simply say things are looking pretty scary out there, huh? Capitalism is failing, the economy is crumbling, and normal people have nothing left to give. It’s something I've been thinking about a lot lately, but I don’t really talk about it. I keep it all inside, like a microwave holding a ball of tin foil while it spins on full power.
At least, that was the case until I played Citizen Sleeper. It’s a rather simple RPG inspired by tabletop roleplaying games, giving you a limited number of action dice that you can spend each day to receive consequences. Mechanically, it doesn’t stretch much further than those actions and consequences, meaning I can instead focus on connecting with characters. In its simplicity, I found a cathartic way to process my thoughts on lots of scary stuff happening in our actual world. I also realised that Starfield, the big space game looming on the horizon which I was previously pretty excited about, just doesn’t seem appealing anymore.

Out today on PC and Switch, it was originally developed by solo dev A Grumpy Fox as a small 30-day project, but it quickly ballooned into something larger. It's now been over a year since A Grumpy Fox first started work on the game, but I think you can agree from the announcement trailer below, it's been time well spent.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m of the strong and perhaps completely nonsensical opinion that any game is better when it’s set on an island. School me in the comments, please do, but I suspect that Escape Academy: Escape From Anti-Escape Island, new DLC launching for the puzzle game today, might lend my claim some extra weight. That could always be the baggage plummeting from the sky over Anti-Escape Island though, where a summer vacation for the students of Escape Academy has gone very, very wrong. Check out the trailer below.

Former US President Abraham Lincoln and Egyptian pharaoh Ramesses II are clearly visible in the artwork. Alongside them are Ngola Nzinga of Ndongo, and someone wearing a ruff that I’m going to have to assume is either Queen Elizabeth I or Mary, Queen of Scots, because That Hair.

Chief among them was Storyteller, a narrative-puzzle game we first saw ten years ago, and has now confirmed a release date of March 23rd. The game’s comic-strip puzzles let you remix classic stories, like Dracula, using various props, verbs and nouns. A game for all the literary nerds out there.

In a statement to GamesIndustry.biz, ZA/UM - the studio that developed Disco Elysium - confirmed the reasons several employees were fired last year. These include "limited to no engagement in their responsibilities", "creating a toxic work environment", "verbal abuse and gender discrimination", and attempting to sell ZA/UM's IP to other companies.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Say what you will about Square Enix's ill-fated ventures into NFTs and mildly embarrassing follies with live service games recently. Their commitment to remaking, remastering and generally sprucing up their ageing back catalogue from decades past is an admirable one in my eyes, even if they are making you pay through the nose for them almost every single time. As we all know, though, some have made more successful transitions than others. The dream, of course, at least for me, is the Final Fantasy VII Remake approach for literally everything, no matter how unfeasible, impractical or physically impossible that would be for Squeenix's enormous game library. Alas, the reality is often a lot more modest. Best case scenario: you're a 90s SNES game getting a lovely HD-2D makeover like Live A Live. Next on the rung: some added 3D zhuzh a la Final Fantasy VIII Remastered (although even that was by no means perfect). 
Mostly, though, it's your Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster treatment. A welcome update that maintains the look of the originals (albeit with some questionable font choices), but that's more or less your lot. Tactics Ogre: Reborn, a remaster of the 2010 PSP remake of the 1995 SNES original, falls squarely into the latter camp, but you know what? That's fine. It's still a rollicking turn-based tactics game all these years later, and one that definitely deserves to be freed from the shackles of Sony's long-dead handheld, where it's lain dormant for the better part of a decade. Besides, I'll take a fully re-orchestrated soundtrack over slightly fancier pixels any day of the week. You know me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With Stadia’s impending shutdown in January, Google has begun fulfilling its promise of issuing refunds to its customers. The process started yesterday, and Google has posted an FAQ breaking down how it works. 
As previously announced, Google is refunding all software purchases through the Stadia Store (such as games, DLC, in-game currency, and current pre-orders) and hardware purchases made through the Google Store; physical store purchases cannot be refunded. Eligible hardware includes:
Stadia Controller
Founder's Edition
Premiere Edition
Play and Watch with Google TV packages
Stadia Pro subscriptions will not be refunded, but members can play their Pro titles until the shutdown. However, those who purchased a subscription on or after September 29, 2022, and were charged for it will have that money returned. 
Refunds will be issued to the form of payment used to make the purchase. If that account is no longer available, Google will send an email with instructions for setting up an alternative method of receiving the refund.
Users may have already received an email notifying them of their refund status. Although payments are now being issued, that doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll get yours today or this week. This will be a gradual rollout that will continue up until January 18. There's no way of knowing when you'll receive your refund, so eligible users should keep an eye on their inbox and bank account over the coming days or weeks.]]></summary>

These are great monitors, don't get me wrong, but you could spend a fraction of the money and still get a brilliant monitor.
That brings us neatly to the subject of this deals post: the Dell S3422DWG, a 34-in ultrawide gaming monitor that sits at the comfortable crossroads of refresh rate and resolution: 3440x1440 and 144Hz. Rather than expensive OLED, this monitor comes with a curved VA panel, offering excellent contrast, great colours and good motion handling, while costing significantly less: just £351 when you use code GSGALLMON10 at the checkout, down from £390.

Both are now discounted from Crampton & Moore via Ebay, with a 25% off coupon ("FLASH25") that maxes out at a pretty sweet £150 discount.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Boy, American McGee's Alice really sticks in the mind of a ten-year-old, doesn't it? It resides in the Goldilocks Zone of creepiness: just the right amount of creepy to be considered cool, and not quite creepy enough to cause nightmares. There were quite a few things I loved about the game, but none more than that deliciously haunting opening theme that played in the main menu.

Any game I play with an inventory gets a regular, satisfying purge. I’m either marching to an in-game shopkeeper and holding my adventuring sack upside down, or just swiftly frisbeeing items straight into the bin. If it’s cluttering my screen, it’s cluttering my mind. Zero regrets. That’s the gamer dopamine hit I’m chasing.
So, as you might have guessed, I love the idea of A Little To The Left, a game that celebrates neatness and tidiness through a string of fun puzzles. If you love the satisfaction of arranging books on your shelf in order of height, or displaying your mugs in order of which can hold the most tea, then you’ll love this game too. Some simple tidying puzzles would have been enough for me, but A Little To The Left takes the idea in interesting directions through smart puzzle design.

Now EA have announced internally that they won't be making any more Project Cars games, and that they will move staff working on the series into "suitable" roles "wherever [they] can."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dell's Alienware AW3423DW is my favourite ultrawide monitor, thanks to its beautiful 34-inch QD-OLED screen that offers perfect blacks, near-instant pixel response times and gorgeous colours. With wide-screen 1440p (3440x1440) resolution and a 175Hz refresh rate, it's both detailed and responsive, and it looks the part too with a very cool space-y design. 
I was lucky enough to review one for several months for Digital Foundry - I think Dell forgot about it for a while - so I consider it my duty to inform you that it is now on sale for the first time ever, dropping from £1099 to £943 - still a big chunk of change, but a fitting Black Friday price for one of the best monitors on the market of any description, hands down.

As I eat my sandwich, I make conversation with Street Fighter 6 director Takayuki Nakayama, who is seated next to me, enjoying his own sandwich. After touching on topics of our respective histories with Street Fighter and other games we've been playing, he asks if I've enjoyed what I've played of Street Fighter 6 to this point.

There’s something about a physical controller, custom built to emulate the action the game revolves around, that lends games a level of credibility you lose the second you try and play it with a regular pad. Playing Guitar Hero with an Xbox 360 controller feels like trying to paint a bedroom wall using a spoon. You’ll get there eventually, but if anyone spots you through a window they’ll rightly assume you’re some kind of deviant.

You’d think being lucky enough to actually play the damn thing would have numbed my hyper-fixation about it a touch, but, nope. I’m afraid not. It turns out the guy who owns eight physical copies (and four digital) of the original Resident Evil 4 is still pretty excited to play the remake. Who ever could have predicted this?


The day my preview went live, Capcom showed off a couple of additional bits as part of a hefty Resident Evil showcase. Alongside a fresh story trailer the company also discussed the various gubbins you’ll receive if you fork out for the game's special edition as well as a short gameplay demonstration. Surprising no one, I’ve watched these clips so many times I now have a load of thoughts that are not only completely useless but are taking up vital brain space I usually reserve for things like pin numbers and dates. If I don’t vent all of this garbage out of my skull there’s a chance I’ll forget my Mam’s birthday again, something that genuinely happened once when I was 17 and I haven’t stopped feeling guilty about it since. I bought her a plant from a Tesco Express three days later thinking that would help. It didn’t. This event haunts me more than any Resident Evil jumpscare ever could.

The last NFL Blitz was released on PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade in January 2012. Even then, it was considered a retro revival title developed by Madden studio EA Tiburon. Before that, we hadn't received a proper NFL-licensed Blitz title since Midway's NFL Blitz 20-03 on PlayStation 2, Xbox, GameCube, and Game Boy Advance. Despite EA Sports acquiring the license from Midway during its 2009 liquidation, the NFL has largely seemed averse to the hard-hitting arcade-style gameplay of the Blitz series.
In August, Arcade1Up, the company behind various arcade replicas, including other Midway classics like NBA Jam and Mortal Kombat, announced the franchise's return through NFL Blitz Le…]]></summary>

In Sonic Frontiers, Sega finds the intersection of the series’ linear past and its “open-zone” future, paying capable service to both eras of the franchise. The open Starfall Islands offer engaging exploration, while linear Cyber Space stages deliver the familiar speed-based Sonic experience. Though each side of the coin has faults, Frontiers is an overall positive experience that serves as a boost in the right direction for the franchise.
Running through the open zones is often a joyful experience. …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The original Dungeons & Dragons RPG grew out of a connection to miniature wargames, so it’s little surprise that the DNA of tactical tabletop play has remained bound to the long-running franchise ever since. The current edition of D&D supports tremendous flexibility in playing out combat how you like, including through tabletop miniature play, allowing big battles to flow out from ongoing campaign storylines in your weekly sessions. However, perhaps your group is more into combat than interconnected storylines. Or, more likely, you sometimes just want a break from the campaign planning to have a focused evening of combat. If that’s the case, WizKids’ new Dungeons & Dragons: Onslaught game should be on your radar.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[God of War Ragnarok is out next week and ahead of the game's release, developer Santa Monica Studio has revealed more than 70 accessibility features in the game. 
PlayStation has been pushing the importance of accessibility in gaming more and more with each new release and Ragnarok is no different. The studio has been quite open with its accessibility desires, detailing more than 60 in a blog post earlier this year. Now, with the game out on November 9, the studio has released an even more detailed post breaking down exactly what to expect. 


Santa Monica Studio says there are more than 70 features in Ragnarok that "enable players to customize the gameplay experience to suit their needs" and the list is a sight to behold. It includes plenty of presets, too, which could make it easier for players to easily get the game started in a way that makes the experience better for them. Presets include one for vision accessibility, hearing accessibility, motion reduction, apply motor accessibility, and a changed setting indicator as well. 
There are alternative control schemes, remappable buttons, hold and press options, in-game assistance settings, and so much more. If you're interested in what accessibility features are in Ragnarok, be sure to check out the full blog post. 
For more, read Game Informer's God of War Ragnarok review and then check out all of the performance and quality modes for the game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The composer for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II, Sarah Schachner, has revealed that she has parted ways with the game and the free-to-play battle royale Call of Duty: Warzone (and likely the upcoming Warzone 2). As for why, she says the working dynamic with the game's audio director has become difficult and she sees no path forward. Variety reports that the audio director in question is Stephen Miller but Schachner doesn't name this person in her announcement. 
News of her departure comes from a statement released by Schachner on Twitter on November 3, as reported by Video Games Chronicle. Schachner's departure comes after years of work with Modern Warfare II studio Infinity Ward on games like 2019's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare and 2016's Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare. Other credits include Assassin's Creed Valhalla and Anthem, as noted by VGC. 
"I am sad to say I can no longer continue to compose music for MWII/Warzone," her statement reads. "Over the past couple of months, the working dynamic with the audio director has become increasingly challenging and I don't see any path forward. As of now, I am unsure of the status and release plan for the soundtrack as it's been taken out of my hands. While I don't have any control over how the music is presented in-game, what will be released on the soundtrack is not my artistic intent in regards to mixing and mastering." 
She then thanks fans for their support and gives some shout outs to others involved with the game's score, including mixer Frank Wolf, "creative vision" Mike Dean, and performing artists including Baseck, Brain Mantia, and M.B. Gordy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft has rolled out its post-launch content roadmap for Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope. Owners of the game’s season pass, whether purchased separately for $29.99 or bundled in the game’s $89.99 Gold Edition, have three big adventures aimed at keeping them glued to the game throughout 2023. 
It all kicks off early next year with the first expansion, Tower of Doooom (their spelling, not mine). This introduces a new combat mode where the team must fight their way up Madame Bwahstrella’s multi-story tower to rescue Spawny, the visor-rocking Rabbid from Kingdom Battle. What’s important to note is that Tower of Doooom will be exclusive to the season pass, meaning you’ll be unable to purchase it separately. 
The second untitled DLC arrives in mid-2023. So far, we only know it takes players to a new planet, features never-before-seen enemies, allies, and secrets, and stars a new antagonist. Finally, Rayman crashes the party in the final expansion to close out the year. Ubisoft’s limbless hero joins Rabbid Peach and Rabbid Mario on a separate adventure in a new location. Unlike Tower of Doooom, the second and third expansions can be purchased a la carte. 
I enjoyed Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope quite a bit, awarding it a 9 out of 10. In my review, which you can read here, I wrote that the game “builds upon Kingdom Battle’s foundation with smart tweaks and fun additions to emerge as a better game in every way.”]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hideo Kojima has finally addressed the conspiracy theories revolving around him and Blue Box Game Studios' Abandoned and in short, it's a nuisance for him, unsurprisingly. 
Abandoned was announced with a short teaser back in 2021 as a game being developed for PlayStation 5 and PC. Not long after the reveal, speculation that Abandoned was actually a Silent Hill game secretly in development began to ramp up, but studio head Hasan Kahraman took to Twitter to shut down those rumors.
From there, the speculation train arrived at the idea that famed Metal Gear Solid developer Kojima was attached to the game. Some believed that Kojima actually was Kahraman on the basis that both their first names start with "H" and both their last names start with "K." Plus, people thought Blue Box was meant to ti…]]></summary>

To call the 2018 God of War a sequel almost does it a disservice. Yes, it was a continuation of Kratos’ original multi-game journey, but it placed him and a new family in a foreign world to reflect on his past and try to secure his future. Kratos’ journey to connect to his son while battling a new legion of distrustful gods was a revelation in both video game storytelling and action, setting a high bar for the inevitable sequel. Ragnarök may lack the unique impact of the prior game, but everything that worked so well the…]]></summary>
