        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lately, there has been chatter of Kingdom Hearts, everyone's favourite mash-up of Disney magic and Final Fantasy-esque action, getting a movie adaptation. These rumours come courtesy of Disney fan site The DisInsider and film industry insider DanielRPK, but I'm not here to discuss the validity of their claims. Rather, I want to talk about how if Disney really does want a Kingdom Hearts movie, it faces an incredibly steep uphill battle.


I can imagine pitches for a Kingdom Hearts movie adaptation have floated within Disney for a while, especially in more recent years. After decades of embarrassments, video game movies have been popping off lately, with the likes of The Super Mario Bros. Movie, the Uncharted movie, and both Sonic the Hedgehog movies proving profitable for their respective I…]]></summary>

While the Ghostfish isn’t the most valuable fish, even when a high quality one is smoked, you do need one for a few different things and they can give some particularly useful items when in a Fish Pond, but more on that later.

Albums are enjoying their second coming in a mostly digital era, and initially, I picked up a few with the sole intent of hanging them on a barren bedroom wall. Yet somehow, somewhere along the way, I wound up with a record player listening to the Silent Hill 4 soundtrack. It gives me a sort of haunted, pinky-out ambience.


Anyway, I’ve got no technical reason for it. My vinyl expertise doesn't extend beyond 'that sounds good' or 'that sounds bad' — and I don’t own any albums that could fund my retirement or make them worth all the fuss.

For the most part, you're going to want to stick with the traditions in the S Tier and A Tier, as they are viable enough for most builds. This means you should always consider going with Discovery, Harmony, Statecraft, Supremacy, or Unyielding. 


Domination is a solid early tradition for Lithoid Slavers, but not useful for others. Enmity works against certain opponents but is also useless in others depending on the build of your rivals. If you have three rivals each focusing specifically on Economy, Research, and Military, Enmity allows you to gain the benefits of all three. Of course, this isn't a common scenario.


Prosperity has typically been one of the best Traditions in Stellaris. However, as of the Machine Age 3.12 update, Prosperity has been extremely nerfed making it nowhere near as viable as the traditions in the S and A tiers.


All of the traditions in the C Tier are extremely lacking at the moment, making them poor options when considered against the alternative options.

Whether it’s crashing, weird clipping issues, or a more favorable exploit, defending democracy reveals the issue fast. And it looks like, as of May 10, there's a new infinite glitch that gives players limitless grenades in Helldivers 2.


If you're running into players blowing up the entire playing field with an endless supply of grenades,  that's not a hack, but it’s an exploit using the Stratagem menu. It works similarly to when there was an earlier instance of this exploit before the Polar Patriots Warbond came out.


When Helldivers 2 launched, one exploit allowed players to carry four of the same Stratagem and call them in over each other during a mission. For example, you could bring in four 380mm…]]></summary>

Most plants are used as materials for incantations you can cast using the Cauldron in the Crossroads. Some can be gathered by hand, but others must be grown. To grow seeds you find, you must play the game long enough to unlock the 'Flourishing Soil' incantation, which gives you two plots of soil in the Crossroads.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are plenty of gods to go around in the Hades universe. So, it only seems fitting for there to be a God Mode, a feature shown in the original. Here's how God Mode works in Hades 2, including how to activate it. 


What does God Mode do in Hades 2?


Hades 2 God Mode is a tool designed to empower players who seek a more accessible experience. It fortifies Melinoë, adding a significant 20 percent Damage Resistance to her stats. This means that enemies will struggle to bring you down, putting you firmly in control of the game. 


With each run, your resilience in God Mode grows. Every time you face defeat, your Damage Resistance increases by two percent. For example, the first failed attempt boosts it to 22 percent Damage Resistance. You may achieve an 80 percent stat if you die enough times, similar to Hades. 


Screenshot by Destructoid


God Mode in Hades 2 can be seen as an 'Easy' difficulty setting, providing a balanced experience for players. It's particularly beneficial for those who want to delve into the game's immersive story. However, be aware that enemy numbers will remain the same, ensuring that combat still presents a fair challenge. 


How to turn on God Mode in Hades 2


To turn on God Mode in Hades 2, open Options in the menu and go to the Gameplay tab. You'll find God Mode at the top, which you can turn on and off anytime.

If Hades 2 functions similarly to the original, God Mode shouldn't impact achievements. But since achievements have yet to arrive in Early Access, we'll have to see if that will change with the launch of the full version.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When it comes to most resources in Warframe, it's a straightforward deal. You get the resources you need, then use them to craft what you want. However, not all resources are so simple. Some contribute toward things that could lead you to craft what you want. One such resource is integral for the Prime gear-grinding loop of the mid-late game. Here's how to farm Aya in Warframe.


Where to farm Aya in Warframe

Aya is earned through either completing Bounty stages or through Void missions. Void missions are arguably the worst of the two options since these can take longer and give fewer chances at Aya. Instead, you should focus on Bounties across Cetus, Fortuna, the Necralisk, and the Sanctum Anatomica. Each Bounty has a chance to include Aya, so you may need to check a few vendors before a Bounty has Aya as a possible reward.


When choosing a good Bounty, you should select the lowest level Bounty that includes Aya as a possible reward. All Aya rewards from Bounties give one Aya, so there's no benefit to completing higher-level Bounties unless you want another reward. Once you have one in mind, simply farm it endlessly until you have as much Aya as you want.


What is Aya used for?


Aya is used at Varzia's shop in Maroo's Bazaar (found on Mars) to purchase Void Relics. These Relics are different from the usual ones you get as mission rewards since they contain the Prime parts of frames, weapons, and other gear that have been temporarily unvaulted. 


For example, the previous Prime Resurgence event saw Inaros Prime, Ash Prime, Carrier Prime, along with various weapons and cosmetics become part of these Void Relics. You should get as many of these Relics as you can and open them since there's no telling when they will return.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you wanted to write a book about all resources in Warframe and how to get them, you probably could. This game has an encyclopedia of resources and ways to get them, though it isn't too overbearing since each resource has a distinct purpose that isn't useful across the entire game, but rather in one aspect. One such resource has limited uses but can be tough to acquire. Here's how to get and use Seriglass Shards in Warframe.


Where to get Seriglass Shards in Warframe


Seriglass Shards are acquired by speaking with Grandmother in the Necralisk. When interacting with her, check out her Oddities through the conversation options and you should see Seriglass Shards listed. Each Seriglass Shard costs 20 Grandmother Tokens, which are acquired either through trading other family Tokens with Grandmother, finding them randomly, or through trading Deimos resources through the Mend the Family dialogue option with Grandmother. Provided you're interacting with Deimos regularly, you should be able to get enough Grandmother Tokens to purchase a Seriglass Shard.


If you don't immediately need a Seriglass Shard, Grandmother Tokens can also be used to purchase an assortment of decorations from her shop. They can also be traded in for 1,500 Standing with the Entrati Syndicate.


What are Seriglass Shards used for?

Seriglass Shards have two uses, Entrati Standing and several weapons. The Quassus, Trumna, and Sepulcrum blueprints each require one Seriglass Shard to craft. Additionally, the final rank of Family with the Entrati requires a Seriglass Shard. This totals four Seriglass Shards, or 80 Grandmother Tokens to purchase everything on offer. That will take a lot of time, but you should get most Grandmother Tokens you need through working toward max rank with the Entrati Syndicate.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The vast majority of resources in Hades 2 are straightforward. If you need a particular resource, you either go and find it in the wild somewhere, or you plant it and wait for it to grow in the Crossroads. You might need to bring a specific tool to harvest something, but that's as far as complexity typically goes, but not in the case of this resource. Here's how to get Shadow in Hades 2.


Where to get Shadow in Hades 2


Shadow is acquired through Alchemy within the Incantation Cauldron. Once you've progressed enough to where you need Shadow, a new tab will pop up in the Cauldron that lets you concoct Shadow with the right ingredients. The ingredients required are as follows:



30 Ash


30 Psyche


3 Fate Fabric



Ash and Psyche can both be acquired as side rooms on each run of Hades 2 and are hard to miss. As for Fate Fabric, this can be purchased from the Wretched Broker in the Crossroads for 60 Bones each. You can also use Charon's Obol Points to order a bulk shipment of any of the above resources. Once you have the resources, simply take them to the pot and start the process. It should take 12 Whiles to brew. Once that's passed, one Shadow will be yours.


What to do with Shadow in Hades 2


Image via Destructoid.


Shadow is used in two separate places. The first is the Permeation of Witching-Wards incantation, which unlocks access to the surface and opens a new side of the game. The other is in the Moonlit Essence from Shadow recipe, which converts one Shadow and one Cinder into five Moon Dust. Moon Dust is incredibly useful for leveling your Arcana Cards late into the game, so you'll eventually want to farm Shadow for it.

If players struggle to meet the requirement for World Series rank, they can also unlock Arrieta through the Ranked program reward path by earning 100 Program Stars, which are earned by completing innings and accumulating stats such as strikeouts, extra base hits, hits, and more. 


There are only four other starting pitchers on the Marketplace, meaning you should focus on unlocking this card if possible. If you already have a strong rotation, the World Series choice pack also has 99 overall Jorge Posada as an option. The switch-hitting catcher has some of the best-hitting stats in the game mode and would easily crack anyone's lineup. In saying that, the 99 velocity and break combination for Arrieta is hard to pass up.

Indika is bizarre, surprising, and captivating. It made me question its reality almost as often as its titular protagonist, a young nun tormented by the Devil, doubts her faith. This odd adventure from its aptly named developer Odd Meter may lack some design polish, but the fascinating tale at its core instilled enough faith in me to see it through to the end.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Once you've played Hades 2 enough to start working on Incantations, you should know that this game has a lot of resources you need to collect. Some of these can be earned on any run, while others are in specific locations or require specific tools to collect. Needless to say, that resource grind will take a good while. 


One such resource is hidden in the far reaches of the game but will come in handy later. Here's how to get Driftwood in Hades 2.


Where to find Driftwood in Hades 2


Driftwood is found through the surface in the Rift of Thessaly region. If you don't have access to the surface yet, you need to play until you get the right incantation to open up the path, then craft it using numerous resources. If you haven't gotten an incantation like that yet, then you don't need to worry about Driftwood or a handful of resources either.


Once you make it to the surface, progress your run until you reach the Rift of Thessaly. This region has you jumping from ship to ship as you fight various enemies, though you should keep an eye on the deck the next time you're up there. These decks have a chance to have a piece of Driftwood on them which doesn't require a specific tool to be picked up. These look like a branch that's fallen off a tree. You should find 1-2 each run provided you clear the entire Rift of Thessaly region.


What to do with Driftwood in Hades 2

Driftwood has two uses with the Incantation Cauldron in the Crossroads. The first is a healing rift that can spawn in the Rift of Thessaly, so you can get a heal before dealing with some of the more difficult encounters. The other is more interesting, opening up a fishing pier in the Crossroads where you can fish with your allies, provided you have the right item.

        <updated>2024-05-10T20:12:59.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wuthering Waves is launching on PC and mobile devices on May 22, 2024. If you're eager to experience the game on PC, checking your specs can help you decide whether your computer can handle it or if it's worth upgrading. Let's take a look at Wuthering Waves' minimum and recommended system requirements.


Wuthering Waves minimum PC system requirements


Meeting Wuthering Waves' minimum PC requirements allows you to play the game in low settings without the game crashing or running at single-digit frames. Here are the game's minimum requirements, as detailed on the Epic Games store:



OS Version: Windows 10 64bit or Windows 11 64bit


CPU: Intel i5 (9th Gen) / Ryzen 2700


Memory: 16GB


GPU: GTX 1060 / RX 570


Storage: 30GB



Wuthering Waves recommended PC system requirements


If you want to play Wuthering Waves at high settings and smooth framerate, its recommended PC requirements are what you're looking for. Here are the game's recommended requirements:



OS Version: Windows 10 64bit or Windows 11 64bit


CPU: Intel i7 (9th Gen) / Ryzen 3700


Memory: 16GB


GPU: GTX 2060 / RX 5700XT and above


Storage: 30GB and above



Although you'll still need solid specs to comfortably run Wuthering Waves, it's not as demanding as other games on the market. Since the game needs to be suitable for Android and iOS without sacrificing quality, it isn't quite as beefy as you may initially expect. Nonetheless, you'll still want to double-check your PC to make sure you meet Wuthering Waves' recommended requirements, alongside keeping an eye on your storage space to ensure you'll have enough room for the game and future content updates.

Then, there's the option to sell these vehicles, another way to afford the luxuries of Los Santos. Find out how to sell cars in GTA 5. 


How do you sell cars in GTA 5?


Players can only sell cars in GTA Online, as GTA 5 Story Mode does not have this feature. Enter this mode and head to Los Santos Customs to begin the transaction. Of course, you'll need to get a vehicle first, so steal a car from some unlucky soul. 


Conveniently, there are four Los Santos Customs locations across the map, including the following areas:



Los Santos International Airport


La Mesa


Burton


Grand Senora Desert



You can also use the points of interest on the right side of the map to mark a nearby Los Santos Customs:

While there, drive inside the garage to sell a car in GTA Online. The "Sell" option will be within the Categories section. You'll get more cash if the vehicle is in proper shape and has additional modifications. So, don't bang into street light poles before entering the garage. 


Screenshot by Destructoid


After selling a car, players won't be able to sell another one immediately due to its 20-minute cooldown period. If you do so, you'll see the notification, "Sorry - we don't need any vehicles right now." That means you can't earn cash fast this way, but you can check out our money guide to see other alternatives.

When I say “set up a server” I mean setting up someone’s client to act as a host. You can certainly rent a dedicated server or, I suppose, just have a dedicated server running, but those things cost money. A dedicated server has the benefit of running constantly, allowing others to log in and out whenever they feel like without relying on the host to be available. These settings still apply when you rent or host a dedicated server, but I just wanted to stress that there is a difference.

Strongest Robin Build in Honkai: Star Rail


Robin is a Physical Harmony character whose main role on any given team is to buff the DMG% of her allies through her Skill. Uniquely to Robin, and her primary counterpart Ruan Mei, she can buff her whole team instead of just one ally, which is uncommon for Harmony Supports. 


What sets Robin apart from the rest of the Harmony roster is her Ultimate, which provides a staggeringly powerful team-wide Advance Forward when activated. This allows teams with Robin on them to perform some truly creative strategy not available anywhere else in the game.

Why don’t you try saying that again... but in English!” Basically, if your wishlist for Homeworld 3 has tone and atmosphere at the top, rest easy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The official Bungie Twitter account has just revealed that Aleph One, Marathon's open-source engine community, has released Classic Marathon to play on Steam completely free of charge. If you have a little over 65 MB of free storage on your PC, you too can now enjoy one of the best and most elusive classic FPS titles of all time.




Readers should know this is not an official Bungie release, but it does have Bungie's seal of approval. It's also a port of the best version of Marathon currently out there.


What's new in Steam's release of Marathon


Though this is a surprise release, it's already a proven title. The quality-of-life updates brought by Aleph One's Classic Marathon are already known, as it's a port of an already existing fan re-tinkering of Marathon. You can expect to find the following improvements:



Widescreen support


Modernized UI and UX


Lua scripting support


Third-party modding


Online Multiplayer


OpenGL support



Why Marathon on Steam is a big deal


While FPS fans have had DOOM on PC ever since it came out, the Marathon series, one of the genre's best early outings, was only available for Mac owners during most of its lifetime. Even though Marathon was later ported to the Xbox Live Arcade, it remained unplayable on PC in any quasi-official capacity until now. If you enjoy classic FPS games, Halo, and Destiny, giving Marathon a try might prove a great trip back into the roots of this great genre.


An official new take on Marathon as an extraction shooter is also in the works, though Bungie has yet to announce a release date. The remainder of the Marathon trilogy will also make its way to Valve's platform at an undisclosed date.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time reinvented the series in 3D and became its new gold standard, Nintendo followed up with a surreal sequel in Majora's Mask. Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days. Majora's Mask's unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.
Join Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard today and each Friday on Twitch at 1:10 p.m. CT as they gradually work their way through the entire game until Termina is saved.

You wait half  a decade for one, and as soon as that one breaks everything, Bethesda releases another just days later.” Yeah, pretty sure that’s it. Anyway, Fallout 4 will get another patch for the near decade-old game next week, presumably to help fix a lot of the problems its long-awaited “next-gen update” introduced two weeks ago.

        <updated>2024-05-10T15:11:44.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Marvel Studios has cast Ralph Ineson as the planet-eating Galactus for The Fantastic Four. PlayStation 5 players might recognize that name as the voice of Cidolfus Telamon, aka Cid, in Final Fantasy XVI. This casting comes from The Hollywood Reporter, which reports that the production will begin shooting mid-summer in England. 
Ineson, whom you might also know from The VVitch, The Northman, and The Creator, joins a star-studded cast for the Marvel Cinematic Universe's first film about Marvel's First Family, which features Pedro Pascal (HBO's The Last of Us) as Reed Richards/Mister Fantastic, Vanessa Kirby (Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning) as Sue Storm/Invisible Woman, Joseph Quinn (Stranger Things) as Johnny Storm/Human Torch, and Ebon Moss-Bachrach (The Bear), as Ben Grimm/The Thing. Joining Ineson is a female Silver Surfer played by Julia Garner (Ozark).


Paul Walter Hauser (Cobra Kai) and John Malkovich (Being John Malkovich) will also appear in The Fantastic Four, although their roles are currently undisclosed. 
If you've played FFXVI, you already know Ineson has an incredible voice, certainly perfect for the role of a massive galactic entity that devours planets; we can't wait to see what he does as Galactus when The Fantastic Four hits theaters on July 25, 2025. 
For more, read Game Informer's Final Fantasy XVI review, and then read Game Informer's exclusive interview with Final Fantasy XVI producer Naoki Yoshida about lessons learned, Clive's reception, loose ends, and more.

Nintendo's digital software sales have grown remarkably over the years — and the same can be said for all of the big publishers. But in terms of where the Big N's focus lies, it's not dedicating itself to a digital-only future.
During the financial results briefing for FY2024, Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa responded to a question about the growth of digital media and the expectations the company have for the "successor to Nintendo Switch" which was announced early this week.

With the recent acknowledgement from Nintendo regarding the existence of the Switch's successor, it feels like the rumour machine has been given a chunky can of spinach and is now working on overtime.
Over on Famiboards, diligent users have been scouring through nuggets of information that might give us more of a clear indication of what to expect with Nintendo's upcoming console, and it seems that a few folks have managed to uncover the Switch 2's codename.

        <updated>2024-05-10T14:05:35.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this week, Xbox closed four Bethesda studios, including Redfall developer Arkane Austin and Tango Gameworks, the team behind last year's Hi-Fi Rush. While each of the four studios affected, which also included Mighty Doom developer Alpha Dog Games and Bethesda support studio Roundhouse Games, released a statement about the closures, Xbox remained silent. 
However, four days later, Bloomberg's Dina Bass interviewed Xbox president Sarah Bond and asked her about the Bethesda closures, to which Bond cited a desire to keep the Xbox business healthy in the long term, even through hard transition periods. 


Here's what Bond said: 
Bass then asked Bond specifically about the closure of Tango Gameworks after Hi-Fi Rush, which by Xbox's own admitted metrics, was a big success. Bond's answer here was less straightforward – you can read it below in full: 
While it's great that Bond addressed these closures at Xbox, it still lacks the clarity you'd expect from one of the biggest companies in the games industry. Neither Microsoft nor Xbox, including Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer, has yet to address the layoffs and closures in an official capacity beyond this.
For more, read about how Redfall was reportedly set to receive a big offline play update this month before Xbox shut down Arkane Austin, and then read about how Xbox is reportedly considering bringing Senua's Saga: Hellblade II to PlayStation 5. After that, check out this story about how more job cuts at Xbox are reportedly on the way, and then read about how the company is debating putting Call of Duty on Xbox Game Pass alongside a price hike. 
What do you think of Bond's answers? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

Nintendo President Shuntaro Furakawa was asked if he thinks the announcement of a "successor to Nintendo Switch" — which was made following the latest finacial report — will affect the momentum of the Switch's current sales.
Responding during the Financial Results Briefing, Furakawa acknowledges that the sales target is high, but that "Nintendo Switch hardware sales remain relatively strong", but that it "is becoming more challenging to maintain momentum as time passes". The company projects that the Switch will shift a further 13.5 million units during FY2025, which is the Switch's eighth year on the market. This figure also doesn't factor in the Switch successor, either, so it's a pretty brave target.

During the quest for a new flat - a quest I would slot somewhere between return to Ravenholm in Half-Life 2 and the Shalebridge Cradle in Thief: Deadly Shadows in terms of overall hopefulness and unpleasant surprises - I toyed briefly with the idea of living in a mobile home.
You can find all kinds of weirdo moving property on Gumtree - houseboats, caravans, yurts, large coats, coffins - but they all share the disadvantage of being cramped and more expensive than described and inadequate to the power and internet needs of a Maxed-Out Videogame Journalist. If I'd seen a house with chicken legs, though? It'd have been worth the sacrifice. Just think, whenever James Archer gives me grief about my performance in Lethal Company I could send my house to step on him.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's once again just about time for a new Pokémon Trading Card Game expansion to hit store shelves. Continuing the Scarlet & Violet series is Twilight Masquerade, a set that focuses on the Teal Mask DLC of the Pokémon Scarlet and Violet video games. Because of that, players can expect locations, characters, and Pokémon from Kitakami, the folklore-rich area from the first part of the Hidden Treasure of Area Zero storyline.
As such, new Pokémon like Bloodmoon Ursaluna, Fezandipiti, Okidogi, Munkidori, and Sinistcha are all featured in Twilight Masquerade. However, the most common new Pokémon I encountered during my opening of several booster packs sent over by The Pokémon Company was Ogerpon; I pulled several different versions of the grass-type Legendary Pokémon from The Teal Mask. 
Pokémon Trading Card Game: Scarlet & Violet – Twilight Masquerade adds 226 cards, including 14 new Pokémon ex cards, more than 30 Trainer cards, and dozens of special-illustration cards. I'll always love Gen I the most, so I was happy to add new cards featuring favorites like Alakazam, Zapdos, Ninetales, and Eevee, but my absolute favorites are the special illustration versions of Applin, Sunflora, and Infernape. I also adore the Hearthflame Mask Ogerpon ex card that I was lucky enough to grab.
You can check out my favorite cards I pulled from booster packs below.

 Pokémon Trading Card Game: Scarlet & Violet – Twilight Masquerade is available on May 24. For more on the long-running Pokémon Trading Card Game, including other galleries from past expansions, head to our Pokémon TCG hub at the banner below!]]></summary>

There is no shortage of party games available on Switch – the console was practically made with the genre in mind. Standing out from the crowd requires some careful balancing of the rules or implementing some gimmick to make your game feel unique. Or, in the case of Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba – Sweep the Board, you can let your licensed anime property do the work for you.
Plenty of effort went into making Demon Slayer – Sweep the Board feel like it belongs in the world of the anime. The 12 playable characters include the three main ones as well as the nine Hashira who represent the best of the best among the Demon Slayer Corps. They each have little interactions with each other that make them feel true to the anime version of the character – Inosuke has a rivalry with Tanjiro, for example.

I can tell it’s deeply powerful because MSI Afterburner’s fan control immediately went mental after I loaded up its free Steam combat demo. What do you mean ‘unoptimised’? That alarming sound is simply my computer shaking with awe at the fearless flippancy required to leave enemies fully untextured so they resemble Metal Gear Solid’s cyborg ninja. The promise of an indie fantasy RPG drew me in, but I must admit, I almost didn’t bother writing about this upon learning the demo is just a pre-Kickstarter combat slice. But something about it entrances me. What it lacks in textures, it makes up for in sheer moxy. You can’t optimise moxy! You can either make MSI shudder in terror or you can’t.

If you're a fan of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom (and we're going to go out on a limb and assume that many of you are), then you'll want to pay attention.
A 'Master Works' art book looking at production designs from the game will be launching in Japan on 30th August 2024, containing a whopping 464 full-colour A4 pages.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Former Microsoft senior PR manager Brad Hilderbrand has blogged about the recent closure of Tango Gameworks and Arkane Austin, making a familiar case that Microsoft’s gaming division are now expected “to cut expenses to the bone” in the wake of the wildly expensive acquisition of Activision Blizzard and amid slowing growth of the Game Pass subscription business. In Hilderbrand’s view, Game Pass will likely never be sustainable or profitable.

The surge in traffic coincides with a UK anti-piracy campaign that aims to deter consumption of pirated football streams.

You briefly meet Orpheus in the base game while playing as leatherclad muse Grace, finding him moping in the underworld, eyes dripping with glam rock mascara. In the DLC he makes a musical comeback on earth, alongside messenger god Hermes. I've not stumbled on Orpheus in the other mythical game of this season, Hades 2 (he showed up in the first Hades but there's no sign he's reappearing in the sequel). So it looks like fans of the ancient Greek sadboi will have to flock to Summerfall's expansion when it comes out this summer.

Although the second game didn't make it to the Switch, the first Jurassic World Evolution launched back in 2020. Frontier states that the third game will release during Frontier's financial year 2026 (FY2026) between June 2025 and May 2026, making it a pretty safe bet for the upcoming 'Switch 2'.

Basically this glitch makes it "impossible to unlock 55 on the Mystery Board". You can tell if you're game is in a glitched state if this is not unlocked and you have obtained "Caduceus" (thanks, OatmealDome).

Afterward, we chat about Shuntaro Furukawa, President of Nintendo, revealing the company will reveal details about the Nintendo Switch's successor within this fiscal year via a post on X. Before diving into our positive reviews of '90s-survival-horror Crow Country and Little Kitty, Big City, special guest Charlie Wacholz joins us to chat about his Animal Well review, in which he calls Bigmode's first published title "a masterclass in environmental design."

When playing through Little Kitty, Big City, it’s difficult to avoid drawing comparisons with Untitled Goose Game. Both see you play as a cute, mischievous animal, and both have you tackle a series of emergent tasks that often come at the expense of the poor humans that inhabit the surrounding area.
With Little Kitty, Big City, however, developer Double Dagger Studio has taken the opportunity to draw inspiration from the game’s feisty feline protagonist and make the experience a bit more whimsical, a bit more stylised, and a bit more ambitious. The end result is a true joy to behold and play, but one that’s also held back from true greatness by its repetitive structure.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stray Gods: The Role-Playing Musical, a creative and ambitious attempt to fuse musical theatre with interactive fiction, launched last August, but that's not the last time fans will get to experience that modern take on Greek myth. Announced today at LudoNarraCon, the game is getting DLC called Stray Gods: Orpheus, which follows the titular character through a new adventure. Check out the reveal trailer below.


Orpheus (played by Rent star Anthony Rapp) appeared in the base game, but only briefly, so this expansion will give players a better idea of his backstory and personality. The trailer also features Hermes (played by Erika Ishii), though their exact role in the DLC isn't clarified. The experience is roughly two hours long with six new interactive tracks and features some returning songwriters, including Austin Wintory, Simon Hall, and Montaigne, but also adds comedic musician Tom Cardy to the mix.
As for the plot, the following excerpt from a press release explains what to expect. "When the curtain has fallen and the show is over, who do you go home as?" it reads. "Choose to reject, embrace, or rewrite the stories the world expects of you. Is the mortal world ready for the return of Ancient Greece’s most infamous bard?"

Stray Gods: Orpheus hits PC on June 27, with a console release date "coming soon." For more Stray Gods, check out our feature on how it was made. For more Greek mythology, visit our Hades II coverage hub for this month's exclusive coverage.]]></summary>

See, these are the kinds of glacial changes of focus and ponderous shifts of strategy you often get at very large videogame publishers such as Microsoft. Trends are cyclical and corporations are sort of just these massive, sleepy hamsters, trundling around the wheel to rediscover practices and projects they once deemed bad for business. Hang on, let me go look up "yesterday" in the dictionary and fetch some sellotape - my brain appears to have exploded.

The game in question is cheery co-op shooter Helldivers 2, over which Aunty Sony recently upended a can of furious worms by abruptly insisting that Steam players have a PSN account for security reasons and so, blocking players in regions where PSN isn't available. Sony have subsequently walked back the requirement following a backlash of truly hellish proportions, though I understand that the game remains unavailable on Steam in certain regions. By comparison, Arrowhead CEO Johan Pilestedt's remarks overnight that the developers might have been "removing the fun" with their gun balancing seem pretty innocuous.

I confess, I found this response annoying - partly because I was hoping Johanas would bring up some obscure indie composer I could then namecheck at parties, and partly, because I have spent years waiting for Tango to escape Mikami's shadow after essentially announcing themselves as a Mikami fan project back in 2010.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[More cuts at Xbox are reportedly on the way, with some staff at ZeniMax getting offered voluntary severance agreements this week. This news comes from a Bloomberg report that says employees across the Xbox organization have been told to expect more cuts. 
These potential layoffs would follow Xbox's decision to shutter four Bethesda studios earlier this week, including Hi-Fi Rush team Tango Gameworks and Redfall developer Arkane Austin. As for the staff offered voluntary severance agreements, Bloomberg reports that producers, quality assurance testers, and other staff at ZeniMax are receiving them. 


The publication also reports the reason Tango Gameworks and Arkane Austin were shut down this week is that they were in the process of pitching new projects and hiring additional staff for said projects, something suggested by ZeniMax head Jill Braff and Xbox president Matt Booty during a town hall held this week. Xbox and ZeniMax chose to shut these studios down – both in the beginning processes of creating new games – instead of closing a studio deeper in development on projects. 
Elsewhere in Bloomberg's report, which details an internal town hall held at Xbox following the studio closures this week, Booty reportedly described its studios as spread too thin, like "peanut butter on bread," and that leaders across the company felt understaffed. Xbox closed three studios and had ZeniMax Online Studios absorb Roundhouse Games to free up resources. Braff said during the meeting, "It's hard to support nine studios all across the world with a lean central team with an ever-growing plate of things to do. I think we were about to topple over." 
These studio closures follow the January layoffs of 1,900 employees at Xbox, Activision Blizzard, and ZeniMax, which add to the total of more than 10,000 laid off in the games industry just this year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Senua's Saga: Hellblade II hits Xbox Series X/S and PC later this month on May 21. However, its release arrives at a rocky period for Xbox, which just shuttered four Bethesda studios, including Hi-Fi Rush team Tango Gameworks and Redfall developer Arkane Austin. As a result, Xbox players have wondered how safe Hellblade II developer Ninja Theory might be after its sequel's release, given Hi-Fi Rush was a "break out hit" for the company but wasn't enough to keep Tango open. 
Perhaps to help boost Hellblade II's sales, Xbox is reportedly considering bringing the game to PlayStation 5, according to The Verge. The publication's Tom Warren writes, "I understand Hellblade II is another game that Microsoft has been considering for the PS5. If that ever happens, at this point, it's not clear if even that would be considered a success." 


Hellblade II coming to PS5 wouldn't be out of left field, considering Xbox has brought previously exclusive games like Grounded, Sea of Thieves, and Hi-Fi Rush to PS5 this year. However, with the launch of Hellblade II happening in just a few weeks, it seems if it does come to PS5, it will be post-launch, which lines up with Xbox's strategy in this realm thus far. 
Senua's Saga: Hellblade II hits Xbox Series X/S and PC on May 21, 2024. 
For more about the game, check out the Senua's Saga: Hellblade II PC specs and system requirements, and then read about how Senua's Saga: Hellblade II will be locked to 30 FPS on Xbox Series X/S. After that, read about how the game will have a photo mode at launch.

Fortunately for Gastrow and solo developer Billy Basso of Shared Memory, they have a true indie darling on their hands that not only lives up to the hype but relishes in the fact that its labyrinth of secrets aims to challenge players for years to come. Animal Well is the product of seven years of development by a single person, and we are delighted to report that the wait was worth it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Computers have always been animal wells, in a sense. They're havens for creatures of many shapes and degrees of literalness, all the way down to the metal. As in ecologies at large, the most abundant and widespread are probably the bugs, beginning with the moth that flew into that Harvard Mark II in 1947 and ending with the teeming contents of the average free-to-play changelog. A little further up the food chain we find "worms", like the Creeper that once invaded the ARPANET, and "gophers", a directory/client system written in 1991 for the University of Minnesota. There are computer animals spawned by branding - foxes of fire and twittering birds and the anonymous beasts that haunt the margins of Google documents. There are computer animals that are implied by the verbs we use in computing - take "browser", derived from the old French word for nibbling at buds and sprouts, which suggests that all modern internet searches are innately herbivorous.

He was way more online when he was younger, and is the one who got me into the games of Lucasfilm, Troika and Blizzard, but these days he plays the games he likes a lot and does not read specialist websites that tell him why he shouldn't like them. He used to play loads of League Of Legends, but the game he was most into more recently was Hades. This is because he studied Classics.
I won't tell you how many years its been since he was at university, but for many years - and still sort of now, to be honest - "liking Apollo" was a key part of his personality. It's interesting, therefore, to text him about Hades 2. Partly because he wasn't even aware it was happening.

Animal Well pleased, surprised, or scared me with something new at every turn as it confidently jumped from one idea to the next up until its conclusion. That novelty lost its luster near the end of its 8-to-10-hour runtime as I treaded the fresh sheen off familiar ground, but it never lost its lively, naturalistically wild heart – even when occasional difficulty spikes compounded that staleness. Still, its tense atmosphere is inherently compelling. Illuminated by dangling lanterns and brought to life with lovingly animated animals and Rube Goldberg-like puzzles bu…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft is reportedly debating putting Call of Duty on Xbox Game Pass alongside a price hike to the subscription service. This comes from a new report at The Verge that follows news earlier this week that Xbox was closing some of its Bethesda studios, including Hi-Fi Rush team Tango Gameworks and Redfall developer Arkane Austin. 
The Verge's Tom Warren writes, "Microsoft has also had internal debates about whether to put new releases of Call of Duty into Game Pass. I understand this is a debate that has been ongoing internally for quite some time, with concerns from some that the revenue that Call of Duty typically generates for Activision Blizzard will be undermined by Game Pass." 


This touches on a potential issues players and analysts have pointed out with Xbox's strategy. After spe…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[How to best describe strategy game Be the Ruler: Britannia when its alchemic reduction of traditionally full-on genres is what drew me to its free Steam prologue in the first place? A less demanding Manor Lords? A more casual Crusader Kings III? Total War with training wheels? It’s got shades of all these games, but thrown together with a wonderfully vibrant wood craft art style. It ends up as something I feel is going to be a lot more approachable for players who like the idea of massive medieval simulations but don’t care to spend time reading a Magna Carta-fat wiki to learn exactly what pop growth percentage is. I know what it is, and most days I wish I’d saved that brain space to e.g learn how to keep house plants alive instead.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[MultiVersus makes its grand return on May 28, and a new trailer reveals that the Joker is joining the roster. Even better, Mark Hamill is voicing the Clown Prince of Crime once more.
Though we don’t see gameplay, a cinematic trailer sets up a dramatic confrontation (and likely emotional reunion for fans) between Batman, voiced in the game by the late Kevin Conroy, and his archnemesis. 


This marks the first game to feature both Batman: The Animated Series actors together as their respective characters since 2018’s Lego DC Super Villans. Conroy passed away in 2022, and prior to 2024's Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, MultiVersus was the final game to feature his Batman performance. Following his death, Hamill had alluded to retiring the Joker role for good. However, dataminers uncovered Joker’s existence in MultiVersus in 2022 and found audio files revealing Hamill’s performance. This means he likely recorded his lines before Conroy’s passing. 
Joker is the first new character to join the existing line-up of fighters, but he won't be the last. We're curious to see who else joins the fray after MultiVersus re-launches on May 28 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.]]></summary>

The prospect of snipers certainly adds menace to the game's forensic sandboxing. The trouble is, the shooters aren't always as sharp as they could be.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sega has revealed Sonic Rumble, a 32-player mobile platforming battle royale, and it's coming this winter. As is par for the course of battle royale-type games, Sonic Rumble puts 32 players against each other competing on various levels and obstacle courses to remain the last person standing. 
In the reveal trailer, it's clear players control various characters from the universe of Sega's Sonic the Hedgehog series, including Sonic, of course, Tails, Knuckles, Shadow, Amy, Dr. Eggman, and presumably more. As you play, you collect rings and these are used to customize your characters in special outfits and more. 
Check it out for yourself in the Sonic Rumble announce trailer below:

Not to mention my love of just riding endlessly in a direction on horseback in Red Dead Redemption 2 and Assassin's Creed Odyssey (helped by Kassandra's wonderful command of "Phobos!" to summon her mount).

Set to hit Switch on July 18, Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition features more than 150 challenges to complete, and you can compete for top spots on global online leaderboards or with friends. 
Nintendo revealed this compilation title with a trailer that pulls heavy on the Nintendo World Championship nostalgia, with previous winners appearing, footage from old competitions, and more throughout. 
Check out the Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition announcement trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, challenges in the game include reaching the Super Mushroom as fast as you can in Super Mario Bros., defeating the Octorocks the fastest in The Legend of Zelda, and reaching a specified gate as quickly as possible in Metroid. And those are just three of the 150+ challenges available in the game, spread across 13 NES games. 
Each week, you can compete for the top spot in the World Championships Weekly  Global Online leaderboards, or you can compete against up to seven friends in the local eight-player Party Mode. 
"With 'byte-sized' challenges and an automatic rewind feature, you don't need to master entire games to feel like a Nintendo World Champion," the trailer's description reads. 
Alongside today's reveal, Nintendo has also unveiled a Deluxe Set for Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition. It includes collectible items, like art cards, a golden NES cartridge, and a physical game card.  

Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition hits Switch on July 18, 2024. The Deluxe Set will cost $59.99, and the digital eShop version will cost $29.99.

The Resident Evil series has redefined and refined survival horror in recent years, arguably single-handedly. However, as the venerable series continues to push the genre forward, a growing number of indie games are looking back to survival horror’s late ‘90s heyday for inspiration. Crow Country joins those ranks, offering a respectable nostalgic homage to the past. Veterans won’t encounter anything they haven’t seen, but the experience is comforting in its spooky familiarity.

Unveiled yesterday under the initiative name "Expansion Open Access," all Destiny 2 players can access and play through the game's Shadowkeep (2019), Beyond Light (2020), and The Witch Queen (2022) expansions. 
"Prepare for The Final Shape with three epic campaigns and earn an arsenal of exotic and legendary gear," the Expansion Open Access trailer's description reads. And speaking of trailer, check out the Destiny 2 Expansion Open Access trailer for yourself below: 


Now, of course, these three aren't the only Destiny 2 expansions but they're the only ones currently available to play through in the game. As such, it might be smart to watch a playthrough or read a narrative summary of all expansions released before The Final Shape next month. 
Here's every Destiny 2 expansion/DLC released since the game's launch: 
Curse of Osiris (2017)
Warmind (2018)
Forsaken (2018)
Shadowkeep (2019)
Beyond Light (2020)
The Witch Queen (2022)
Lightfall (2023)
The Destiny 2 Expansion Open Access period lasts from now until June 3. If you're a PlayStation Plus subscriber, you also currently have access to Lightfall, making now a perfect time to catch up. 
For more, watch the Destiny 2: The Final Shape reveal trailer here, and then check out this breakdown of The Final Shape's new prismatic subclass, enemy faction, exotics, and more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Arkane Austin was reportedly set to release a big Redfall update this month that would have added offline play to the always-online game before Microsoft suddenly shut the studio down, according to IGN. This follows yesterday's news that Microsoft was shutting down Arkane Austin, Hi-Fi Rush developer Tango Gameworks, Mighty Doom studio Alpha Dog Games, and absorbing Roundhouse Games into ZeniMax Online Studios.
This offline play update would have addressed one of players' biggest complaints with the game – that Redfall always requires a connection to the internet – but now that update will never see the light of day. It's an especially concerning detail considering now that Arkane Austin is closed, the day when Redfall servers are no longer live, rendering the game unplayable, seems closer than ever before. 


IGN also reports that it was told the now-canceled Hero Pass, which would have added two additional playable characters to Redfall, was scheduled for release around Halloween. It obviously won't be released now – Bethesda says those who purchased the Hero Pass will be eligible "to receive the value of the upgrade" – but if it had hit the game around Halloween, that would have been roughly 18 months after Redfall's launch. 
Redfall hit Xbox Series X/S and PC on May 2 to poor reviews from critics – read Game Informer's review here – and players alike, and the first-person multiplayer vampire shooter failed to recover, with Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer saying, "I'm upset with myself," when asked about its launch.
According to reports, some of Arkane Austin's staff hoped Microsoft might cancel Redfall or reboot it as a single player game, following the former's acquisition of ZeniMax Media in 2020 for $7.5 billion. Arkane Austin director Harvey Smith said Microsoft canceled a PlayStation 5 version of Redfall following this acquisition.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fans of Helldivers 2 have started a petition asking developers Arrowhead to reinstate a fired employee in charge of community management. The employee, "Spitz", was let go following the fiasco in which Sony told PC players they would need to link their Steam and PlayStation Network accounts to continue playing the shooter. Sony and Arrowhead changed their mind about that after player backlash in the form of 100,000+ negative reviews on Steam. The kicker? Community manager "Spitz" was low-key encouraging players to continue the review bombing. This doesn't seem to have gone down well internally.

The pack is called Omenroad, and if nothing else, it's an opportunity to remind you that if you like campfire yarns and droll webcomics and haven't played Wildermyth then you should get that seen to immediately.

Everyone can empathize with waking up late at night and sitting in agony as your brain forcefully makes you relive a traumatic, embarrassing, or heartbreaking moment. Our past is with us forever, and how it manifests in the present is a toss-up from day to day. With My Past, the debut game from developer Imagine Wings Studio, attempts to blend those feelings with platforming-puzzle gameplay and does so excellently. The result is a therapeutic five-hour adventure I'll be thinking about long after today.

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/05/07/marvel-snaps-may-2024-season-takes-a-turn-for-the-multiverse-with-blink-and-the-exiles"/>
        <updated>2024-05-07T19:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The success of Marvel Snap rolls on, as does the seasonal structure of the free-to-play, deck-building card-battler from Second Dinner. Recent seasons have been themed after corners of the Marvel Universe, like Avengers vs. X-Men or Thunderbolts, but this season leans a bit more into the Marvel Multiverse with Blink and the Exiles. This season, titled "A Blink in Time," introduces five new characters, two new locations, and more.
The new characters joining the game in A Blink in Time are as follows:
Blink (5 Cost, 7 Power)

	
On reveal, swap the last card you played with a higher-cost card from your deck.

	
Nocturne (3 Cost, 5 Power)
	
You can move this once. When this moves, replace its location with a random new one.

	
Sage (3 Cost, 0 Power)
	
On reveal, +2 power for each different power among all other cards here.

	
Namora (5 Cost, 6 Power)
	
On reveal, give +5 power to each of your cards alone at another location.

	
Sasquatch (6 Cost, 10 Power)
	
Costs 1 less for each card you played last turn.

                  

On top of those all-new characters joining Marvel Snap collections, there are two new locations: Panoptichron, where cards that didn't start in your deck get +2 power, and Cancun, where power at that location doesn't count toward winning the game. New albums featuring Dan Hipp and Rian Gonzales also further incentivize Variant collections by rewarding items themed after Werewolf By Night, Silk, and Iron Lad. Finally, we know the dates of the Series 5 releases of this season. Baron Zemo and Nocturne get their Series 5 release on May 7, Sage arrives on May 14, Namora on May 21, and Sasquatch on May 28.
Marvel Snap's May season, A Blink in Time, kicks off today. For more on Marvel Snap, check out Charles Harte's opinion piece from when the game originally arrived on mobile devices.]]></summary>

Softwarový gigant, kterému krutě ujížděl vlak na poli mobilních platforem si koupil telefonního giganta, kterému také krutě ujížděl vlak. Nokia skončila se Symbianem a přešla na nově vznikající systém Windows Phone. Výsledek se dostavil o 4 roky později, kdy Microsoft definitivně vydáním posledního telefonu s Windows Phone současně celou akvizici za 7 miliard dolarů odepsal a začal se soustředit na jiné cesty jak vydělávat v mobilním světě.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Upon learning of the existence of asymmetrical multiplayer horror Killer Klowns From Outer Space: The Game, from Friday the 13th and Predator Hunting Grounds’ Illfonic and Teravision Games, you’d be forgiven for having, well, questions. The first of which, understandably if you don’t happen to carry a burning penchant for cultishly adored but undeniably niche 80’s schlock, is simple: Why? First, why get invested in another asymmetrical multiplayer game from a studio that has a bit of a history with limited shelf lives? And why, of all the licenses, have they chosen one so relatively forgotten, at least in comparison to Predator, Ghostbusters, and Friday the 13th?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You won't be surprised to know that after two years in early access, V Rising's 1.0 launch hasn't seen Stunlock Studios drastically change the V for "Vampire" to V for "Venetian Blinds" or "Vienna Sausage". From a top-down view, you still play as a newly awakened vampire on PVE, PVP, or private servers, and you're still tasked with becoming the most powerful bloodsucker around. It has, however, streamlined some things and added in an endgame zone. All of this combines to form a survival game that was great back then and is even better now, with thrilling MOBA-esque fights and little in the way of faff.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hardcore tactical FPS Gray Zone Warfare is proving to be yet another of 2024’s unexpected successes, shifting over half a million copies when it launched into early access last week. Unfortunately, in its attempt to eat Escape from Tarkov’s lunch – a timely one, given that game’s self-inflicted DLC misery – it’s currently choking on the wishbone of some truly dire performance issues. Even players with tip-top graphics cards are seeing heavy stuttering while out in the field, and none of the updates released thus far, including today’s Hotfix #3, have done much to soothe it.
Said hotfix does include some fixes for other widespread problems, including a second attempt at preventing players from becoming headless when rejoining a server (an amusing though resilient glitch, given a previous hotfix had also tried to nix it). But having played a bit of this third patch on a usually reliable RTX 4060, there’s clearly an awful lot of work left to do before Gray Zone Warfare performs acceptably.

Naturally, our favourite gods and goddesses are emerging from our evenings of hacking and/or slashing. For me, Nemesis provides a lot of chuckles. Not because she's bright and jokey (she is frownier than a wet bulldog). But because she's determined to put the player in their place and to beat you at your own roguelike. Narratively, she fulfills a role similar to Meg in the first Hades, that of closest frenemy. But in gameplay terms, Nemesis won't stoop to something as trite as a boss battle. Oh no. She's out to mess with your build.

The game, which was being co-financed and co-published by Tencent, was in the early concept stage, according to Remedy, with only a small team working on it. 
The studio says it canceled Codename Kestrel to focus on other games it's developing in its portfolio, noting that because of this cancelation, its other projects will get "experienced developers reassigned from Kestrel."
Plus, Remedy says planned investment and the need to recruit additional employees for Kestrel is removed with this cancelation.

Nintendo has released its latest round of financial results, this time for the end of Fiscal Year 2024 (which ended in March). The Switch has surpassed 140 million units sold, further securing its place as the second-best-selling console in the company's history, and Nintendo has also revealed it will announce the Switch successor by March 2025. 
Despite great numbers in this round of financial results, Switch software is down roughly 5% compared to the same time frame for Fiscal Year 2023. Nonetheless, its games are still selling well comparatively in the wider market. With the latest numbers on Switch software, here's Nintendo's most up-to-date list of its best-selling Switch games:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo has revealed the Switch has surpassed 140 million units sold, further securing its current place as the second-best-selling console in the company's history. This news arrives at the same time Nintendo has revealed it will announce the Switch successor by March 2025, meaning there's still some time for the Switch to catch up to Nintendo's best-selling console: the Nintendo DS. 
Since the last financial results call, the Switch has sold an additional 1.96 million units, bringing its grand total up to 141.32. That keeps it in second place, only behind the Nintendo DS' massive 154.02 million. It's possible the Switch surpasses the Nintendo DS, especially considering the Switch will likely continue to sell even once its successor is released, but that's a big 13 million-unit gap to close. 


Elsewhere in the financial results, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom has hit 20.28 million units sold, Super Mario Bros. Wonder has sold through 11.96 million, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe another 6.79 million, and Pikmin 4 3.33 million. The fiscal year ending with March 2024 was a strong one for Switch software, selling 163.95 million units in Q1 through Q3 of Fiscal Year 2024. However, compared to the same quarters for Fiscal Year 2023, Switch software is down 4.7%. 
With the Switch successor on the horizon, that number will likely be way up this time next year. 
In the meantime, read about the Nintendo Direct happening next month, and then check out Game Informer's top 10 Switch games. After that, check out this list of the Switch's best-selling games.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo will reveal the Switch successor within the current fiscal year, which ends March 31, 2025. However, the company says there will be no mention of this successor during a Nintendo Direct it is holding in June; this Direct will instead be focused on the games coming to Switch in the second half of 2024. 
While this isn't the first hint of a Switch successor from the company, it is the most direct and comes from the same financial results where we learned the Switch has sold an additional 1.96 million units since the last one, bringing its total up to 141.32 million. Software has reached 1.235 billion units. 


"This is Furukawa, President of Nintendo," the company's announcement reads on X (formerly Twitter). "We will make an announcement about the successor to Nintendo Switch within this fiscal year. It will have been over nine years since we announced the existence of Nintendo Switch back in March 2015. We will be holding a Nintendo Direct this June regarding the Nintendo Switch software lineup for the latter half of 2024, but please be aware that there will be no mention of the Nintendo Switch successor during that presentation."
This announcement follows industry reports from earlier this year stating the Switch successor was targeting a March 2025 release date. That could still be the case given Furukawa's reveal, but given the timeline, Nintendo could also announce the successor that month, meaning we likely wouldn't have it in our hands until later that year. Only time will, though, but at least we now officially know that by this time next year, we'll know what the successor to the Switch is.

It's about a middle aged woman navigating her past and present by taking a closer at her mind, which means sorting through a load of magical realist meldings of memories. It's very pretty, and I liked the demo a lot.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hades II has launched into Steam Early access, and it’s also Game Informer’s next cover story (which launches on May 14).  Whether you’re a returning fan or a newcomer, it may take a few runs to get your bearings as Hades II sports new progression systems, resources, and new layers to existing mechanics. It can be a lot to dig into, given the game more or less tosses you into the deep end without context for how things work, at least initially. Instead of spending several runs figuring things out, here’s a short, spoiler-free primer explaining some core new features to get you going on the right foot. 
What Are Ashes? 
Ashes are a currency used for unlocking Arcana cards. They serve a similar purpose as Darkness from the first game. They often appear as a reward for completing a room, but …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been sampling Hades 2’s early access build on the Steam Deck, and my only complaint – besides the smooching frog having eluded me for hours – is that it’s giving me very little to write about, performance analysis-wise. Honestly, it fits the dinky PC so well you’d have thought Supergiant had decided to make this roguelike sequel a Steam Deck game that just happened to run on desktops by accident.
Hades the first was much the same, taking to the Deck like Hercules to Augean shit, but Hades 2 barely even gives away that fact that it’s unfinished. It doesn’t crash, stutter, or hang, and there’s no point in talking about settings when it runs at a practically perfect 60fps on max quality. Make that 90fps on the Steam Deck OLED, too. It’s just a fabulous game for handhelds, even in its earliest of early access days.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hades II, the much-anticipated sequel to Supergian's excellent roguelike, is entering Early Access today and is on the cover of Game Informer Magazine with incredible original art by acclaimed artist Jen Zee. Join Alex Van Aken – who visited Supergiant for the cover story and has played Hades II extensively – and myself for a look at the game's second area and boss fight. Spoilers ahead if you want to experience the locations and enemies for yourself, but otherwise, enjoy this New Gameplay Today episode!
This second area in Hades II is called Oceanus, an underwater realm Melinoë uses to bypass the armies of Chronos, the game's antagonist and Titan of Time. Oceanus is generally more difficult to navigate than Erebus, the first area, due to explosive hazards, more powerful ranged enemies, and darting schools of swordfish. The level culminates in a musical boss fight against a rock band of sirens led by Scylla, a well-known sea monster from Greek myth. Scylla sings while her keyboardist and drummer back her up. Despite sharing one health bar, the individual monsters can be stunned and knocked out of the fight, muting the appropriate instruments in the active music track.

As a boss battle in Hades 2 they are a deadly trio that has bested me more times in the last few hours than I care to admit. But as a sign of things to come for this early access roguelike sequel, they are an encouraging bunch of characterful malcontents. The harbingers of a confident, slash-happy action game, and another poppy adaptation of classic Greek japes.

After playing several hours of the Early Access build (which is publicaly available as of today), we traveled to Supergiant Games' studio in San Francisco to interview several of the core team members – creative director Greg Kasavin, studio director Amir Rao, art director Jen Zee, composer Darren Korb, and voice actor Logan Cunningham – to get the full story of the game's creation. The cover story reveals why Supergiant decided to create its first sequel, how it chose a new protagonist in Zagreus' sister, Melinoë, along with her mythological origins, and how the team is changing its approach to early access and the content it has planned for the future. It also features an in-depth breakdown of Hades II's new features and our impressions …]]></summary>

The early access action-RPG launched with notable performance problems that developers Moon Studios promised they’d address, starting with several hotfixes over the last few weeks that managed to claw back some frames. The game’s first big patch goes a step further, seemingly boosting the game’s performance to a degree that its minimum and recommended hardware specs have been lowered as a result.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ghost of Tsushima, the hit 2020 PlayStation-exclusive samurai game, rides onto PC on May 16, and ahead of the game's launch there, developer Sucker Punch Productions has revealed players will not need a PlayStation Network account to play through the game's single-player story mode, as reported by VideoGamesChronicle. However, a PSN account will be required to play through Ghost of Tsushima's multiplayer Legends mode, or if you want to use the new PlayStation PC overlay to acquire trophies and more. 
This follows news from last week where PlayStation announced (and later walked back) that Helldivers 2 players will soon be required to link a PSN account to their Steam account, leading to widespread anger in the game's community. It seems Sucker Punch is looking to get ahead of this by revealing its PSN plans ahead of the game's launch in 10 days. 
Thank you for your feedback.
May 3, 2024
If you're unfamiliar with Ghost of Tsushima: Legends, it's a standalone multiplayer experience that allows you and up to three other players to fight enemies in special missions, defeat waves of foes, and complete raids. A PSN account will be required to play Legends, but if you want to play through the game's story (and Iki Island expansion), you won't need one. 
Ghost of Tsushima hit PlayStation 4 on July 17, 2020, before launching on PlayStation 5 with a Director's Cut on August 20, 2021. This is the version of the game hitting PC in 10 days on May 16, 2024.
For more about the game, read Game Informer's Ghost of Tsushima review, and then read about why the Director's Cut of Ghost of Tsushima is a must-play for fans.

Norland is sort of The Sims meets Dwarf Fortress meets RimWorld. It gives you charge of several new kingdoms that have sprouted from the corpse of a fallen Empire and are now feuding for supremacy.

Ahead of the game's May 21 launch, developer Ninja Theory has revealed the PC specs and system requirements for Senua's Saga: Hellblade II and to play the game at its best, you'll need quite a powerful system. 
If you're familiar with Ninja Theory's work, you likely already know it pushes the envelope with technology so it might not come as a surprise your PC will need to do the same. But if you're new to this team, or just want to check if you're ready for the game later this month, we've got you covered. 


Senua's Saga: Hellblade II PC Specs And System Requirements
Below is a chart released by Ninja Theory detailing everything you need to know about running Senua's Saga: Hellblade II at its most demanding, recommended specs, and even at the bare minimum. And as you can see, it's a game that requires a lot of power (click the image to enlarge). 
Hellblade II hits Xbox Series X/S and PC on May 21. 
For more, watch the latest Hellblade II trailer here, and then read about Hellblade II's photo mode and what to expect from it at launch. After that, watch this Hellblade II gameplay trailer.

Amongst other things, they'd reach over and flick the power off while I was playing The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening. I didn't finish that game for 15 years. I'd flown the family nest before I braved the Eagle's Tower. Can you imagine what my friends would have done if I'd owned a Game Boy Camera? Probably, they'd have taken photos of... bottoms with it, and such. 
I'm aware I'm not making a great case for being a graduate of the School of Hard Knocks. The point is: I didn't have a Game Boy Camera then, so I'm delighted that the Game Boy Camera has caught on among a later generation of indie PC developers - prominent among them artist and educator Catharine Graffam, whose GB Camera Gallery: Mystery Show you can play for free in a browser.

The environments take hefty influence from Carceri d'invenzione, a series of prints created in the 18th century by Giovanni Battista Piranesi, whose name has become a byword for impossible spaces.

It's now almost seven years later but at least one person has not forgotten this missed opportunity. A fighting game modder has been tinkering with shaders to bring the comic book style of previous games to Infinite. Looks cool.

Reader, I do think it's quite atmospheric, but I do not think it's all that unsettling. If anything, I find it a bit dull, in a way that's semi-frustrating.

As Edwin pointed out to me,  that’s about the price of a third of latte, although he does pay London prices. Also, Edwin, are you going around trying to buy the dregs of people’s lattes? I cannot judge. Were it in short supply, I too would debase myself for caffeine in an instant.

May 13th (unlucky for some) will see this fairytale kingdom city builder launch into 1.0, after a comparatively short but successful early access run on Steam. It looks very sweet, and reminds me of a kind of Foundation meets Lakeburg Legacies - at least based on the trailer, which puts an emphasis on it laid back and idyllic citybuilding, and love.

It's this which most interests me about The Forever Winter, which takes place in a "PvEvE conflict" in which enemy factions - including enormous, stomping robots - are constantly fighting one another while you and your squad try to scavenge and survive in their shadow. Its first trailer showing in-game footage is below.

This is the day the XDefiant preseason will take begin, giving players a chance to enjoy the shooter before its official first season begins. This release date reveal follows various betas and tests for the game, which at one point, resulted in the game getting indefinitely delayed last year.

I'm so far unconvinced by the need to pay real money to unlock a premium warbond, therefore. The trailer for the next premium warbond, coming May 9th, does contain glimpses of some weapons I'd like, however.

On the one hand, you've got to deal with interdimensional horrors of various flavours, such as multiple-storey cryptids and squishy skinless wolves; on the other, invading squads of Combiney soldiers. Fortunately, you've got a big fat Ivy League brain stuffed with knowledge of killer gadgets, base construction, subterranean farming and battlefield medicine. My increasing phobia for survival games notwithstanding, I think this looks and sounds like a hoot - and it's out now in early access. Here's the launch trailer.

Then you watch its trailers and find surrealist imagery, genre-hopping, and a bleak sense of humour are part of its arsenal, and suddenly it seems, to me, irresistible.

It's out now.

His demonic influence manifests into world-distorting gameplay sequences as Indika explores the rural wilds of early 20th-century Russia. Tack on bizarre pixel art flourishes and other overt video game elements, and we can't tell if Indika is taking itself seriously or not. But we do know that we want to keep playing it.
Join editors Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard as they explore an early section of this attention-grabbing adventure available now on PC (and PS5 and Xbox SeriesX/S later this month).

It's often invoked as an archetype for the humanist worldview of Man the Measure and Centre of all Things, holding a perfectly proportioned universe in shape. Rin D'Lorah, the heroine of new narrative RPG Sky Of Tides, is a bit like the Vitruvian Man, and the result is a game I find at once bewitching and powerfully offputting in its refusal to satisfy the conventions of the genre.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Keoken Interactive, developer of Deliver Us The Moon and Deliver Us Mars, has laid off nearly its entire staff. The studio’s two founders are the only remaining employees.
Founders Keon Deetman (CEO) and Paul Deetman (managing director) announced on social media that after the studio failed to secure funding during the Game Developer’s Conference (GDC) in March, it had “exhausted all our possible options for publishing, work for hire, and co-development.” As a result, the remainder of its staff has been let go. GameIndustry.biz confirmed that 13 employees were affected, 11 of which were full-time and 2 freelance contractors. 
The Deetmans have made a call for any studios with open positions to hire its affected staff. The founders plan to stay in business and have vowed to rebuild, which includes launching a Kickstarter to crowdfund Deliver Us Home,  a sequel to Deliver Us Mars. 
It was clear Keoken was in trouble when the founders posted a video in March revealing it had been unable to land a publishing deal after spending two years pitching five games to over 40 publishers. Instead, the founders decided to publicly reveal these projects to help garner interest, one of which was Deliver Us Home and two were Deliver Us The Moon spin-offs, including a VR game. 
Keoken once employed 45 employees, but the headcount was reduced to 20 by March 2024 before four more employees were let go that month. In an interview with GameIndustry.biz, the Deetmans revealed they had gone months without collecting a salary to help stay afloat.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Universal Orlando Resort has released a new video detailing what to expect at its Florida-based Super Nintendo World when it opens as a land in its Epic Universe theme park next year. In it, the company confirms the land will have three rides, including the Donkey Kong Mine Cart Madness coaster that's expected to open later this year in Osaka, Japan's Super Nintendo World. 
The video includes digital fly-overs of the park, showing viewers what it will look like when it opens next year. If you've seen Super Nintendo World in Japan, this park looks nearly identical, with both the Donkey Kong Country (and mine cart coaster) section and the Mushroom Kingdom with Peach's Castle, Mt. Beanpole, the Mario Kart: Bowser's Challenge augmented-reality ride and Yoshi's Adventure dark ride. 
Check it out for yourself in the new Super Nintendo World overview video below: 


As you can see, the Donkey Kong Mine Cart Madness coaster will feature state-of-the-art track technology that allows it to create the illusion that riders will actually jump off the tracks, just like in the Donkey Kong Country games. 
Like in Hollywood's Super Nintendo World, which does not have the Yoshi's Adventure ride or the Donkey Kong expansion as a result of space at the location, and Osaka's Super Nintendo World, guests can purchase Power-Up Bands to play in interactive Key Challenges to earn coins and more. Plus, returning locations like the Toadstool Cafe restaurant and more will be at Orlando's iteration of the park. 
Here's a look at some of the locations to expect when Universal Epic Universe opens next year: 

For more details about the park, read Game Informer's breakdown of everything coming to Epic Universe next year. After that, check out photos from our visit to Japan's Super Nintendo World, and then watch this vlog of our day at the theme park.

Not ‘the country of Africa’ bad, but certainly not good enough that you’d want me on your pub quiz team. Also, I still do the Shredded Wheat rhyme internally when I have to follow directions. However, I do enjoy making maps turn a different colour in strategy games, Total War chiefly among them. Well, one such map is expanding before my confused idiot eyes, that being Total War: Pharaoh’s. It’s getting a new, distinctly Mesopotamia and Aegea-shaped bit. I believe that’s just south of Eastopotamia and Wegea.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Update, 2:47 p.m., May 2, 2024:
Earlier today, we learned that Take-Two Interactive, the company-publisher behind the Grand Theft Auto series, had closed Rollerdrome studio Roll7 and Kerbal Space Program 2 studio Intercept Games. Both of those games, and many others including the recently released No Rest for the Wicked, were published by Private Division, an indie-publishing arm under Take-Two.
Now, in a new update from GamesIndustry.biz, the publication reports that Take-Two has shuttered the "vast majority" of Private Division's teams in Seattle, New York, Las Vegas, and Munich, according to one of its sources. When GamesIndustry.biz reached out to Take-Two for confirmation, the company issued the same statement that can be read in Game Informer's original story below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Medieval city builder Manor Lords was Steam's most-wishlisted game prior to release, and has now managed the feat of transmuting that anticipation into broad enthusiasm and very healthy sales. Not too shabby, considering that it's mostly the work of just one person, Grzegorz Styczeń of Slavic Magic, who has hopefully found time to sleep now and then between fielding bug reports and preparing the game's first patches.
Styczeń understandably doesn't have much time for interviews right now - those troublesome archers aren't going to balance themselves - but yesterday I spoke to Tim Bender, CEO of Manor Lords publisher Hooded Horse, about how Styczeń is getting on. The answer, apparently, is: pretty good, because Styczeń has a healthy approach to early access development in keeping players close, without quite handing them the wheel.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Remember that bit in that Guy Ritchie film where Dexter Fletcher shoot a guy and then throws a glowing jar over his soldier that summons a bunch of skeletons to help him out? Me too! Must have been the direct influence for Sea Of Thieves' new Season 12, which launched earlier this week with a bang - from two smoking barrels! Among the additions in this season of the ever popular salty sea-dog open-world adventure are double barrel pistols. They deal less damage per shot but have higher rate of fire, and you can charge them up to fire both barrels at once. 
On the other end of the weapon scale are new throwing knives, capable of sneak attacks, light slashes, or, you know, throwing. You can nab any throwing knives you see lying around, too, which is fun. But honestly, the Bone Caller tool (the aforementioned jar of skeletons, which has a great Jason and The Argonauts vibe) and the Horn Of Fair Winds are are probably more useful. The winds from said horn can make your ship go faster, but can also put out fires or crowd control enemies, or for some reason make you swim faster? I don't think that makes sense, to be honest, but the horn has limited uses so as not to make you an unstoppable wind machine.

I've never put in the many, many hours needed to earn the requisite gear nor partied up with the many, many people necessary to slay a big dragon. If only raiding was possible without these things… well, my saviour seems to have arrived in a form I wasn't expecting: 2D anime bunny girls. Rabbit And Steel is a co-op action roguelike that's raiding without the pre-grind and it looks rather wonderful.

With the announcement of Fallout 76, fans are scrambling for clues that will shed light on the new game. A few concrete details come from the pre-existing information on Vault 76. Most vaults in Fallout were built for a specific purpose, and according to references in Fallout 3, Vault 76 supposedly held 500 people for exactly 20 years before opening and repopulating the surface.
Repopulation is important and all, but is this the most interesting route for a new Fallout? Playing a wastelander on a noble quest is something we’ve already done several times, but a game built around the events of a specific vault is an intriguing proposition.

This week, well over three years later, a 40-year-old former operator of an illicit IPTV service became the first person to be convicted under the PLSA. While a win is a win, the case wasn't entirely straightforward.
