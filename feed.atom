        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let's roll
Katamari Damacy is one of those games that you don't hear about a lot these days, and yet someone everyone seems to have played it at some point in their lives. The premise is simple, but it's so engaging that it'll keep us coming back for more every time. Just when I thought it was impossible to improve on the tried-and-true Katamari formula, a modder came along and proved me wrong in the best way.
Originally spotted by Time Extension, computer scientist and custom controller enthusiast Dr. Tom Tilley created a "super cheap" controller setup to roll his way through the game using some empty roll-on deodorant packaging, some cardboard, a computer mouse, and a soccer ball, or football for the non-Americans. Tilley rigged the setup work with an emulated PS2 version of Katamari Damacy, and the video he posted on YouTube makes me wish I had a version of it myself.
https://youtu.be/PHPJ2wTBJlo
A roller-ball is the way to go with this game, which is evidenced by the fact that Tilley wasn't the first one to build a similar prototype -- back in 2014, a YouTuber by the name of Siage uploaded a video of another prototype for a custom Katamari controller. I think this one might actually be my favorite seeing as it swaps out the soccer ball for one plastered with the faces of Disney princesses.
I can't see a future where mass production for such controllers would make any sense, but I'd love to see some full-scale implementations in the form of some Katamari Damacy arcade machines. I want 2023 to be the year that we bring both arcades and Katamari back into the limelight of public consciousness, and then combine them together to achieve my new life's goal -- playing this game with a roller-ball controller.

That's despite the most recent swing of Ubisoft's game-cancelling scythe, which was brought down on three unannounced games last week due to the company's underperforming sales.

One of the things I have always loved about beat 'em ups was that, as a genre, they’re a blank canvas. The formula is set, you just have to build the where, why, and how behind it. This lets the developers really go wild when making some of these games. As a child of the arcade heyday, I have fond memories of classic games like Final Fight and X-Men. But one element that always stood out to me was just how batshit crazy some of the boss designs were. 
You could just tell that the developers wanted the biggest, weirdest thing to show up and make the players go “wow”, and it worked. It works so well in fact that decades later I’m here to tell you the top ten weirdest bosses in beat em ups.

For years, if you wanted to play The Division 2, you'd have to go through the Epic Games Store or the Ubisoft Store due to exclusivity contracts. However, it looks like those deals have finally expired, because the sequel to Tom Clancy's online action role-playing game is now available to play through Steam. If you've been wanting to play the title on PC but didn't want to go through either of the Epic or Ubisoft stores for whatever reason, now's your chance to grab it on your platform of choice.
As exciting as it is that The Division 2 is up on Steam there are a few caveats to consider — for one thing, the game doesn't come with any Steam achievements, which can absolutely be a deal breaker for achievement-hunting types. If nothing else, it's a bit of a bummer. Then there's the fact that while you launch the game through the Steam storefront, you still have to go through the Ubisoft Connect launcher, which is another headache in and of itself.
https://twitter.com/UbisoftSupport/status/1613642068043210757
The Division 2 has also been met with mixed reviews on Steam, as many players have encountered bugs and technical issues. A good handful of players have had the game crash on them, which Ubisoft says they are currently looking into. Hopefully they can iron out these issues as the company continues to migrate more of their games to PC, especially with the next title to get this treatment will likely be the behemoth that is Assassin's Creed Valhalla.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Desktop Dungeons is a morish puzzle game from 2010 that channels conventional dungeoning into fiendish headscratching. Every enemy sits still, waiting for you to come and whack it. Whack willy-nilly, though, and they'll kill you in no time - so you have to tactically explore parts of each level to heal, while targeting foes in an order that lets you survive long enough to level up and take on the big bads. 
Desktop Dungeons: Rewind is an upcoming "modern remastering" of the original, with 3D graphics and the ability to rewind time rather than start each level from the very beginning. It's got a demo you can play right now, and it's adding free daily challenges with a sharable leaderboard later this month. I am hyped.

It took a while, but the Persona series has finally made the jump to Switch. After stealing our hearts in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate (and a spin-off 'sequel' and spin-off remaster found their way onto the console), the main series finally made its way to Nintendo's hybrid console in late 2022 with Persona 5 Royal.
Persona 3 Portable and Persona 4 Golden are following this up on 19th January 2023, and ahead of their joint release, we wanted to ask the ultimate question — what is Persona? Well, not really, but with lots of names, Goldens, Royals, and FES' being thrown around, just what on earth are the differences? What versions can we play on Switch? And, if you've only played the spin-offs or Persona 5 Royal, what should you play next?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not available on the NHS
Tonic masters GameFlavor have teamed up with Capcom to produce a limited edition box of drinks stylized after the famous "First Aid Spray" health items from survival horror series Resident Evil. The Resident Evil First Aid Drink Collector's Box is available to pre-order now from the GameFlavor website.
According to the press release, the box contains 10 x 330ml First Aid Spray Cans, each containing a uniquely flavored drink based upon the herby nature of the Resi series. Also included are four "Ink Ribbon" cases, filled with a distinctly blended spice mix, as well as a pseudo spray cap for the can, and a list of cocktail recipes. Each set is housed in a replica "Storage Crate", individually numbered to one of 4,750 available sets.

 
As you might have guessed from its extremely limited nature, the Resident Evil First Aid Drink Collector's Box does not come cheap, and will retail for a princely €199.90, (or roughly $210). Not a typo. At that price, I'm assuming that the drink has the exact same magical restoration properties of its video game counterpart, but that's probably pretty unlikely. Still, if you're an ultra die-hard Resident Evil fan, or you simply like crazily expensive "on trend" drinks — I hear that's a thing for The Kids these days — then you can pre-order your own set right now from the official GameFlavor website.

The Resident Evil First Aid Drink Collector's Box is expected to ship in the third quarter of 2023.

Retro platformers are not hard to come by. I count myself among the group of video game players who welcome efforts from small development teams that play to our nostalgia for an era where playing video games meant tuning to channel 3. Some are fantastic, some are too hard to be enjoyable, but most land somewhere in the middle. Vengeful Guardian: Moonrider won’t go down in history as one of the greats that both embraces the past and modernizes the action, but I would place it closer to the fantastic side of the scale, even if it doesn’…]]></summary>

Yet it was also tempered fun: a brutal AI Director could easily tip manageable chaos into a fatiguing onslaught of fishy alien minibosses, and I still remember my will to persevere being sapped by connectivity issues and a general lack of weight to the otherwise enticing pew-pew gunplay.


Happily, following a year of tweaks and additions, The Anacrusis is in a much better place. Even if that place is still turtleneck-deep in extraterrestrial viscera. Ahead of the game’s first anniversary, I poked developers Stray Bombay for a chat on how their early access approach is working out, the impact of long-awaited mod tools, and what’s next for this most stylish of space shooters.

Damn, it looks like the era of BRIDGET is set to continue — Not only has the Guilty Gear star made her GG Strive debut, appeared in some fun fan projects, AND received her own, real-life Bullet Yo-Yo, but merch maker Spiritale has now revealed a prototype wicked-looking figurine, currently in production.
The prototype captures Brisket in all of her glory, posed exactly as she is in her Guilty Gear Strive splash art. Rocking her big ol' shoes — Bullet Yo-Yo in one hand and haunted companion Roger in the either, our girl looks set and ready to embark upon her next Bridgetquest. The fixed-pose figurine looks very similar in quality and design to Kotobukiya's "Bishoujo" range, though Bridget is also sporting a nicely detailed base as she comes kick-kicking her way into the next battle.
https://twitter.com/Spiritale_shop/status/1613453295808569345?s=20&t=YPDS_v7VvYZruEFEXsxmHg
Unfortunately, Spiratale has not revealed a price nor a release window for the Bridget figurine. For whatever it's worth, Spiratale's typical character figurines tend to stand at a 1/7 scale and usually run around the $200-$300 dollar mark. So the more hardcore fans among you might have to start saving up the pennies. To be clear, this price is pure speculation on my part, merely based on the company's previous releases. We'll be sure to give you a heads-up when Bridget is ready for pre-order.
Guilty Gear Strive is available now on PlayStation and PC platforms. An Xbox port arrives this spring.

It's a pretty but largely empty-feeling time, with woefully repetitive mission design and characters I only have a passive interest in. It's good, therefore, to see Assassin's Creed Mirage creative director Stéphane Boudon make more noises about how the next Creed game will be smaller and "more intimate".

A few weeks back, Pokemon Scarlet & Violet players had the opportunity to take down Cinderace in a 7-star Tera Raid (Fighting Tera type) and earn the Pokemon for themselves. Just like the Charizard event, there's a second chance weekend.
That second chance kicks off today (right now actually), and will run through January 15. You have roughly two full days to unlock 7-star raids if you haven't already, then locate and take down the Cinderace. As a reminder you can only get one Cinderace per save file, but you can take the raid on an unlimited amount of times to amass rewards, and you can breed that Cinderace into a Scorbunny.
If you still aren't raid-ready, it's currently unknown if this Cinderace will be distributed again in the future. Right now all we have to go with is wording on the Charizard news post (which Cinderace did not get), which technically only applies to Charizard currently: "Charizard may appear again in other events or be encounterable in different ways in the future."
You still have time if you haven't clean up that postgame path to 7-star raids yet! With a strong team you can get it done fairly quickly.
If you need help, we have numerous resources for the Cinderace event, including:
A full guide on the easiest ways to clear the Cinderace raid
How to find the Cinderace raid
A breakdown of the Cinderace raid rewards and Pokemon stats
A reminder that the event Cinderace is available for breeding

Computer scientist and custom controller kitbashing experimenter Dr Tom Tilley had the same thought and, erm, rolled with it. In a case of life imitating art, Tilley repurposed a trackball he’d made from roll-on deodorant and a soccer ball to play the game with (thanks, Time Extension). You can watch Tilley mucking about with the trackball to control an emulated version of the PS2-era Katamari Damacy in the video below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What makes a good platformer? Christ, I don't know. Why would you open an article with that. Calling Kandria a platformer feels a little reductive, so there's a need to clarify why it works. You play as an android revived several decades after an apocalypse, by a tiny camp of survivors who inevitably need your help. A lot of this help involves, well, platforming. To the point of having nonsensical areas of pure platforming in between you and a destination or secret area. You'll climb, jump, do the little dash thing that recharges when you touch the ground or pick up a hovering lamp thingy. You'll land on a lot of thorny instakill spikes.


So yeh, lots of the old platforming, but it feels more like an exploration and scavenging game, with a side order of light-light-heavy-dodge combat too. And a plot with varied dialogue options and mysteries about the world and its history. It's immediately and consistently fun, but I'm not sure exactly how to recommend it. Hmm.

This year, believe it or not, sees the Street Fighter franchise celebrate its 35th anniversary. And alongside the anticipated release of Street Fighter 6, the fan community can undoubtedly look forward to a bevy of fantastic fan tributes, designed to acknowledge over three decades of fighting game excellence.
And we're kicking off the year with a doozy of an example, as director Jeremy Mansford, audio engineers White Owl Studio, and musician/narrator Vo Williams have come together to produce a stunning piece of animation celebrating Capcom's iconic series and, more specifically, the legacy of its most notable of World Warriors, Ryu.
https://youtu.be/FVSgnfDc3aI
Titled "Fight Your Rival", the gorgeous, 80-second animated film captures the wandering hero's journey through the franchise, from the early mastery of the martial arts, through his battles with the Four Kings of Shadaloo, the war with his inner demons, powered by the frightening form of the Satsui no Hado. The animation ends with his twilight era, which sees Ryu a wiser, more spiritually content warrior who — despite his advancing years — will never cease pursuing the thrill of the fight. Not until his final breath.
And with a whole new generation of opponents awaiting him, it seems that the fight is far from over.
Street Fighter 6 launches June 2 on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

The pace is high, the movement tricky, the guns have like, 18 bullets in a clip and it's really easy to buzz them all into thin-air. But once a few friends held my hand and taught me to be patient and position myself properly, rather than charge into battle at any given opportunity, the game began to click. And what a battle royale it is.

Talking to Variety about his career ahead of his 75th birthday, Carpenter was asked about rumours he could be helming a non-interactive take on Dead Space. Considering Carpenter hasn’t made a film in 13 years it does seem a bit of a wild idea, but then the director is both a horror auteur and video game fan.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[World of Words
Epic Games Store has revealed the next title that it will be offering up gratis for its huge army of users — Available to download from January 19 to all users, it's the unique, narratively driven Epistory: Typing Chronicles.
Developed by Belgian studio Fishing Cactus and released back in 2016, Epistory is the tale of a young girl, who rides a three-tailed fox around a constantly evolving origami world, under attack from an array of paper spiders and other crease-tastic bugs. Epistory: Typing Chronicles is a particularly original title from both an aesthetic and gameplay standpoint. Not only is its delightful paper world incredibly cool and inviting, but the game's story and world unfolds, (quite literally), via the player's typing ability. It's a unique, smartly conceived concept, which you can see in action for yourself in the trailer below.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1qg_8JKojE&ab_channel=FishingCactus
The player follows on-screen typing prompts in order to control our hero, defeat their enemies, and advance the core story itself. Much like other word-based video games, such as The Typing of the Dead, speed and accuracy will be the tools necessary to progress through the adventure, accessing new areas, while protecting our foxy friend from an increasingly aggressive army of bugs. Epistory is a very novel release, and almost worth the price of admission alone for its beautifully crafted origami universe.
Epistory: Typing Chronicles will be available to download from the Epic Games Store from January 19. Until then, you can still pick up murder mystery freebie First Class Trouble from the EGS dashboard.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Writing up our big guide on all the upcoming PC games of 2023, I was introduced to a number of smaller games in development I hadn't heard about before. One of them was Broken Roads, an isometric RPG set in a post-apocalypse Australia. The gorgeous artwork was enough for me to click on the Steam page and read more, and while scrolling through the screenshots something strange caught my eye.
It was a screenshot of a fairly traditional RPG dialogue scene, with a panel at the bottom displaying all the possible dialogue options for the player. But what caught my eye was an unusual radial graphic on the right-hand side of the options. Reading on, I discovered that Broken Roads uses a rather unique Moral Compass, one which plots your overall moral stance towards the world and its people with a golden arc. Different decisions may rotate the arc, expand it, contract it, lengthen it, or shorten it. And in so doing, you'll unlock various traits dotted about the Compass, which only remain in effect for as long as that golden arc covers those traits within the wheel.
I can see a dozen different ways in which this Moral Compass may end up being a bad idea in practice. But I don't care. I adore it. And I'm going to play Broken Roads solely so I can see the consequences of my actions in satisfying radial form.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Did they only just hear about it?
In the latest chapter of a story set to run throughout 2023 and beyond, industry giants Google and Nvidia have reportedly expressed concern to the United States Federal Trade Commission (FTC) over the proposed purchase of Activision Blizzard by publisher Microsoft.
According to a new report by Bloomberg, internet developer Google and graphics card company Nvidia have both provided the FTC with testimony in preparation for the latter's upcoming lawsuit, filed against Microsoft in early December 2022. It is reported that the testimony demonstrates concern that the purchase could give Microsoft an unfair advantage in regards to lucrative issues such as gaming subscription services, mobile gaming content, and cloud gaming support.
The supposed complaints from Google and Nvidia would join the previously aired opposition from Sony, which is most likely concerned over the possibility of losing access to Activision's billion-dollar shooter franchise Call of Duty. Should the lawsuit go to trial, which at this point seems incredibly likely, then spokespeople for all three companies could, in theory, be called as witnesses for the FTC's case. And that's a particularly mighty trio of brands to face down, even for Microsoft.
Microsoft needs to find favor of the FTC before its $68.7 billion dollar purchase of Activision Blizzard can go ahead. Even once the lawsuit clears, MS would still need to seek approval from other global regulators, including the European Commission and the UK Market Authority. Furthermore, regardless of the result of the trial, both parties have the option to appeal the judge's decision, seemingly guaranteeing this debacle will run into the tail-end of the year and perhaps even into 2024.

We have a little over a month to go before Kirby's Return to Dream Land Deluxe flies onto the Switch. This is bound to be an exciting time for those of us who love Kirby and are a fan of the 2011 Wii game, but there will also be many out there who can't help but think, "wait, didn't we only just get a new Kirby game like yesterday?"
Generally, those who are having such thoughts are correct — obviously, we didn't actually get a new Kirby title yesterday, but we get the idea all the same. Just last year we got Kirby and the Forgotten Land and Kirby's Dream Buffet (two very fun titles, we must admit), so to have another addition to the puffball pantheon so soon feels like, simply put, a lot.

The service was quietly killed off at the beginning of this year and removed from GOG’s site, which didn’t go unnoticed by frequenters of the GOG subreddit. GOG confirmed the closure of Connect to RPS fan site PC Gamer, saying “for a long time nothing really happened there, so we've decided to shut it down”. Fair enough.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fork over that extra dollar
HBO has always been one of the pricier streaming services, but with shows like Succession, White Lotus, and the show that arguably kicked off the current golden era of television, The Sopranos, you're basically always guaranteed to get a good bang for your buck. We'll have to see if that holds true after yet another price increase, because the cost of HBO Max has risen yet again.
The change went into effect today, January 12, making the service's former $14.99/month price for the ad-free tier has increased $1 to $15.99. It's the first price hike since the launch of HBO Max back in March of 2020.
https://twitter.com/hbomax/status/1613672303090335746
While it's impossible to know for sure why the company decided to raise the price, there's a chance that they're simply keeping up with the rising costs of inflation, especially after their competitors like Netflix have done the same. Of course, it does seem a bit convenient that this change is happening only days before the premiere of The Last of Us TV adaptation on HBO Max, which will likely be one of the biggest streaming events of the year.
The show has been receiving rave reviews from critics, and as a fan of the series myself, I'll be interested to see how they translate such a beloved game to a live action television format. Here's hoping the price increase is worth it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Be careful out there!
As popular as streaming is nowadays, a number of companies enforce a certain set of rules when it comes to new-release games. The Japanese company Atlus is one that's done this time and time again with games like 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim and Persona 5 Royal, and now it's released its guidelines for Persona 3 Portable and Persona 4 Golden. This information comes from the company's Japanese website, so the rules may be slightly different here in the west.
Despite being enhanced re-releases from 2009 and 2012, it's still asking streamers to be courteous of viewers by placing spoiler warnings in their stream. One example (as highlighted by Siliconera) is to insert a spoiler alert when streaming Persona 4 Golden's culprit's dungeon. Anyone streaming or uploading video footage of these returning games is also asked to make sure they feature the Atlus and Sega copyright.

Obsidian is in peak form, if you ask me
We're already looking ahead to an amazing year of releases in 2023, but part of me still can't let go of one of my favorite games of last year: Pentiment. Although it was released mid November of 2022, I didn't play it until a month later when we were in the midst of the end of year rush, so I didn't get to give it as much attention as I thought it deserved. So here I am, taking a moment to highlight not only what a great game I think Pentiment is, but also my thoughts on how this game's mere existence, along with its subsequent success, is actually a good thing for the games industry as a whole. Let's get into it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A long-awaited reset
Assassin's Creed is one of those game series that's been around for decades at this point, and in that time, the titles have evolved a lot. From the tightly-focused stories of its early days to its sprawling open world adventures in recent years, there's something in there for everybody. Long time fans of the games, though, have requested that the series take a step back and make a return to its older games, and this time, Ubisoft has taken fans' requests to heart.
In an interview with GamesRadar+, Assassin's Creed creative director Stéphane Boudon confirmed that while the series' sprawling titles like Odyssey and Valhalla are "great games with the promise to live an epic journey in a strong fantasy," they will be pivoting to place a greater focus on "character-driven story" and "the core pillars of the first ACs in a more intimate scale." This is music to my ears as a fan of shorter single player experiences, so I'll be excited to check out a new Assassin's Creed title that presents a more streamlined experience.
https://twitter.com/assassinscreed/status/1568690133666340864
Ubisoft announced that Assassin's Creed: Mirage would be the next entry in the series last September, and soon after revealed that the game would follow Basim from Assassin’s Creed Valhalla. The story will follow his coming-of-age in the backdrop of ninth century Baghdad.
As much as I love hearing that Assassin's Creed is going back to its roots, part of me wonders if scaling back was a necessity first. Ubisoft's release lineup has already been hit by another wave of cancellations and delays, so cutting back to a smaller scale for the AC series would help relive some of the pressure on the development team. Whether it was a survival move or a creative on, I think it's a smart move -- players have been asking for more narrative-heavy AC games for years now.

Sony has released a new firmware update for its still-far-too-big-for-its-own-good platform PlayStation 5 — Update 22.02-06.50.00, which is now available to download, paves the way for the arrival of the PS5 premium controller DualSense Edge, which will launch worldwide on January 26.
Officially revealed in October 2022, the DualSense Edge is a component-based version of the standard PS5 controller, which comes packaged with various modules to allow complete customization of the premium unit. DualSense Edge features full programmable buttons, as well as adjustable trigger pressure, custom dead-zone positioning, and save states for different users and games. In addition, the DualSense comes with its own storage case, which doubles as a charging dock.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvmmWeov68s&ab_channel=PlayStation
While an impressive piece of technology, the DualSense Edge comes at a cost, namely $199.99 USD, which equates to a staggering £209.99 GBP or €239.99 EUR, half the cost of the digital edition of the PS5 console itself. Sony has also noted that DualSense Edge will have a "moderately" shorter battery life than the original DualSense, which makes the new controller an exceptionally niche purchase.
Can you put a price on adjustable Haptic Feedback? Sony sure has
The PS5 DualSense Edge launches January 26, exclusively on the PlayStation Direct store. It will be made available at other retailers, online and offline, from February 23. For more details, see our previous report.

It's a big day for Pokémon. The series has finally crossed over the four digit mark for their total number of pocket monsters -- a milestone they celebrated with an nine minute-long video. Another piece of information that shouldn't go overlooked, though, is that they also announced that another patch is on the way in a press release that came alongside the video. The Pokémon Company said that the update will be coming sometime in "late February," although that's as specific as it gets for now.

Scarlet & Violet have been heralded as some of the best entries in the series that we've seen in a few years, but it's undeniable that they got off to a rocky start. Since the release in November, there has already been a 1.1 patch to try to squash some of the games' myriad of bugs -- this new one coming up in February will be 1.2. The only details the press release divulges is that the update "will include bug fixes and add functionality," but also says to "please look forward to more details soon." Some players are hoping to finally see the update integrate Pokémon Go into the mainline series, but as of now, the integration of any new features outside of fixing issues and quality-of-life features is entirely up in the air.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sinister skin returns to Fortnite store
The sinister Plague Doctor skin has returned to the in-game store of Epic Games' juggernaut battle royale title, Fortnite. The purchasable costume has been conspicuous by its absence since January 2020, notably the same timeframe that saw the growing status of the global COVID-19 pandemic.
As noted by Eurogamer, the "Scourge" and "Plague" skins have made frequent appearances in Fortnite's rotational shop since their 2018 debut, available to purchase for 1500 V-Bucks each. But both outfits have been missing for two years, finally making a reappearance in-store earlier this week. The skins depict the frightening, beaked "plague doctors" of the 16th century, who would fill the beaked masks with herbal remedies in an effort to stave off infection as they visited the slums of working-class patients.
While Epic Games never made any open statement as to the reasoning behind the costume's removal, it's not hard to imagine that somebody might have thought it a wise and prudent move to not fill the world's most popular video game with Plague Doctors during a period of global sickness.
The COVID-19 pandemic is, of course, very much still with us, but enough time has passed that many companies and communities are readjusting to a "Post-COVID" status, though it should be clearly noted that the coronavirus and its variants are still infecting hundreds of thousands of people on a daily basis. In total, some 13.2 billion doses of the COVID-19 vaccine have been administered since 2020.

Since Fire Emblem: The Blazing Blade — or just Fire Emblem as it was known in the West — made its way to the West on the Game Boy Advance thanks to the popularity of Marth and Roy in Super Smash Bros. Melee, the series has filled a cutthroat, tactical RPG void on almost every Nintendo console since – all the way up to the stellar Fire Emblem: Three Houses on the Switch.
Known for wide casts of colourful characters, challenging maps, permadeath, dozens of classes, and more recently matchmaking, the plots of political intrigue often get left out of the Fire Emblem discussion. A shame, because the writers over at Intelligent Systems have put together more than a few decent yarns over the series' 30-year+ history. As such, we expect this month’s Fire Emblem: Engage to have a great story as well, despite much of the conversation being focused on the protagonist’s toothpaste hair.

What started as seemingly just a bunch of Disney classics (Mickey, Goofy, Donald Duck etc.) has rapidly spread into wider franchises like Pirates of the Caribbean and it is even knocking on the door of some Pixar favourites with the collection of Monsters Inc. drivers.

Things are lower key this week for the eShop, with a few indies hitting the service: both newish and oldlish. One game in the latter category is Shieldmaiden: Remix, which is currently on Steam, and has a modest amount of positive reviews. Oh, and it has a pretty cool little hook on top of the 2D pixel art aesthetic: "The end of the world just started and everyone is gone. The machines took over and your only goal is to look for your missing sister in a retro wave atmosphere. Fight and find your way into the danger with your shield in this vibrant pixel art world."

Surprising no one, Pokémon Scarlet and Violet finds itself in first place once again, bringing in an additional 291,322 copies to make up a cumluative total of 4,630,253 - that's insane. Splatoon 3 isn't too far behind, mind, selling an impressive 107,700 copies to make up a total of 3,795,514. We'd comfortably wager that Splatoon 3 will be passing the 4 million mark in a few weeks.

Marvel Snap might want to ensure that they have a hand as mighty as Thanos this month, as developer Second Dinner has announced that its highly-anticipated PvP Battle Mode will be launching in the digital card battler as soon as this month.
First announced back in the fall of 2022, the Marvel Snap PvP Battle Mode will give players the ability to swiftly and thoroughly pound their pals into mush, slapping down a series of cards designed to ruin everybody's day. I'm looking at you, Agatha Harkness. The update is expected to launch on January 31, though the developers ask players for patience in lieu of any possible last-minute delays or pushbacks.
In addition to PvP Battle Mode, the new update will debut Marvel Snap's official rebalance system, known as "Series Drop". This semi-regular event will see higher-level cards — for example Series 3, 4, and 5 — drop a tier each, increasing their chance of appearance ahead of any newly debuting characters. The team is aiming for one Series Drop per month. It should be noted that the most powerful cards, such as Thanos and Galactus, will not be reduced in rarity. As these fellas are bad boys 4 life.
Finally, Second Dinner notes that is currently investigating the rate at which Tokens are earned, in line with the price of in-store cards. The team hopes to come up with a fair and acceptable way to help Series 3 players push toward the upper echelons of Series 4 and 5 with less frustration. While no specific changes were announced, Second Dinner will continue to experiment with balance tweaks to help expedite progress.
Marvel Snap is available now as a free-to-play title on iOS and Android devices.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Things are looking up
Fire Emblem Engage is nearly here, and we talked quite a bit about it (and the expectations therein) recently in a preview article. At this point the only thing left is a few odds and ends, as the game is set to launch just next week on January 20, 2023.
Until that time, there's a few minor commercials that have popped up on Nintendo's YouTube channel, which provide a closer look at some of the game's major mechanics, and cast.
Fire Emblem Engage Commercial 1
The first commercial provides a brief look at the setup of the narrative, which you're probably going to be skipping if you're going in blind. The fantastic elements and the more grounded kingdom hopping angle are briefly mentioned too, as well as quite a few closeups of bond system (including Alear, the main character, and Marth), and some combat animations. It's short, but to the point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cj4yHLTCd9Y
Fire Emblem Engage Commercial 2
The next commercial focuses more on the party members/Emblem Ring conceit, and has a short "tactics" section that gives us some brief strategic gameplay. The core of this video lies in the opportunities to customize your party, which includes class types and Emblem Ring/Engage pairings (read: equipping party members with the spirits of classic Fire Emblem characters).
Multiple heroes from prior Fire Emblem games are teased as well toward the end of the video.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5D8Qakq0GM
While short, these clips get the gist of the new entry across. Now all you need to do is wait for some impressions, or for January 20 to hit so you can dive in.

I liked time-travelling between Dracula's abode and ancient greece, chopping a variety of killer goblins that squawked, "NICE TO MEET YOU!", in varying octaves.
While another FPS of the "micro" variety would be grand, I'd love a "microracer". Much in the same vein as my beloved Screamer, I'm desperate for a – linear or otherwise – arcade racer whose only concern is to burn rubber through all manner of world stages.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The big moment is eight minutes in
1000 Pokemon: wow! Well, 1008 to be exact, and we are counting. I've had the phrase "101" embedded in my brain since Pokemon was first released in the '90s, and it's been hard to adjust ever since. When I first heard someone say "there are over 200 Pokemon now in Gold & Silver," I wasn't ready for it. Now time has completely passed me by, and we're at 1008 Pokemon. Just....wow.
You can witness that passage of time in roughly nine minutes by watching the video below, which The Pokemon Company just put up on their official YouTube channel today. Here's a quick primer for the relatively straightforward clip: "Twenty-six years after the release of the original Pokemon games—Pokemon Red Version and Pokemon Green Version in Japan—the number of Pokemon discovered has finally surpassed one thousand! Let’s celebrate the occasion with a look back at some of your favorite Pokemon!"
Of course, the big moment here is the "1000th" Pokemon, and that moment comes at roughly eight minutes in. From there they move on to the legendaries of the newest Paldea generation, which might be spoilerish somewhat if you haven't finished the game yet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa08Y-fhfTI&t
Time marches on, and so does Pokemon
We're at a crossroads for the series, especially with Pokemon Legends getting tons of praise on various "best of" lists, and Scarlet & Violet leaving a lot to be desired, from a good chunk of the fanbase. While the team is no doubt working on the next thing already (and likely some DLC for Scarlet & Violet), it'll be interesting to see the lessons learned from Legends and the Paldea generation, because there are a lot of them to take in.

        <updated>2023-01-12T15:32:54.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Linda Tiger's career in gaming started two decades ago, in a test house in Glasgow. “I started in QA back in 2002. I worked on functionality and localisation testing. Eventually, I became a lead and then a QA manager at a studio,” she tells me, as we talk at India Game Developers Conference in Hyderabad, India. Now, Tiger is at Paradox Development Studio as the studio manager of Studio Black, and the former lead producer for Crusader Kings 3. She even stood in front of a suit of armor to drop the game's first tease.


 An RPG-esque lifestyle system and neat backstab choices that deal with information round out Crusader Kings 3's host of improvements over its excellent predecessor. A court-themed expansion and a revamp of the game’s culture system after launch are a testament to Paradox’s resolve to deliver a refined plotting experience. Holy wars and illicit affairs go hand in hand in the world of Crusader Kings and the third iteration is no different. Weaving together systems to consistently deliver emergent gameplay is no simple feat, and it turns out that production also covers all manner of small but essential, and practical things. As the lead producer on a game as complex as Crusader Kings 3, Tiger had her work cut out for her.

Two more Tera Raid Battle events are coming to Pokémon Scarlet & Violet very soon. Alongside a substantial patch that promises "bug fixes and added functionality" in February, and following the Pokémon Encounter 1008 video, Game Freak and The Pokémon Company have revealed that a new 7-Star Raid is coming to the game along with a cute little Valentine's Day-themed raid (thanks, Serebii!).
The 7-Star Raid is currently shrouded in mystery, but we know it'll come with a Poison Tera Type and will have the Mightiest Mark. You'll also only be able to catch this new 7-Star Pokemon once per save file. The 7-star raid will be available on 27th to 30th January, and again on 10th to 12th February.

This new trailer provides yet another beautiful glimpse into the painterly world of Season while providing new details about what our protagonist is doing: archiving the end of the Earth and the final people still living on it. She strives to capture their final moments in her journal and with her camera, aiming to learn why they're still around and ultimately, what kept them going. It sounds like quite the emotional journey.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Motive Studio and publisher EA have released a new story trailer for its upcoming remake of Dead Space, and the game continues to look terrifying and beautiful. 
Due out on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC later this month on January 27, this might be one of our last looks at the remake before it's in the hands of players. Fortunately, this new trailer is nearly two minutes of cinematics and gameplay from the remake focused on the story of Dead Space. As expected, this remake isn't changing much at all, utilizing the same story from the original 2008 release with updated visuals and audio (plus some new voice lines for protagonist Isaac Clarke). 
Check out the new Dead Space Remake "Humanity Ends Here" trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, Dead Space Remake continues to look great and we can't wait to play it in just a few weeks. 
For more about the game, check out this extended Dead Space Remake gameplay look and then read why it's one of Game Informer's 25 most anticipated games of 2023. Check out Game Informer's big list of upcoming video game remakes after that.

Indeed, the debate over whether the little reward messages add anything to games or not has been reignited today on Twitter by developers, with Ubisoft Massive's lead gameplay designer Fredrik Thylander saying they've been actively "bad for gaming". So we thought we'd put the question to you, readers. Do you agree and think achievements have been a blight on the industry, or do you think they're actually good way of getting more out of a game?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Humanity Ends Here
While the actual release is still two weeks out, publisher Electronic Arts is hoping to get the hype fires going with a new "launch trailer" for its highly anticipated remake, Dead Space. The iconic interstellar horror title makes its grand return January 27 on PC and ninth gen console platforms.
The dramatic, explosive trailer somewhat belies the sinister, slow creep and sense of pervading dread that punctuates Dead Space, making it appear something more of an action movie than a survival horror title. But, as fans will know, the 2008 original was one of the finest examples of the genre, and there's no telling how studio Motive has been able to bolster the excitement, adventure, and nerve-wracking tension of Visceral Games' seminal work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctQl9wa3ydE&t=78s&ab_channel=DeadSpace
Having been around the rumor mill more than enough times one would care to remember, the Dead Space remake was finally announced in the summer of 2021, with fans eagerly twiddling their thumbs for the past two years, eager to get their hands on the long-awaited title. The remake retains the narrative of the original game, as engineer Isaac Clarke investigates a distress signal sent by planetary mining vessel the USG Ishimura. Once aboard, Clarke discovers that matters have taken a turn far worse than anyone could have imagined, it what becomes a violent, terrifying fight for truth and survival.
Dead Space launches January 27 on PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X.

In fact, you can now pick this up on Amazon for $730, a $370 reduction from the $1100 price this XFX Speedster Merc319 card launched at in August last year.

When I hear that a new game is coming based on a popular shonen anime or manga, I tend to assume that we're getting another fighting game that I'll forget about within a week. I can only assume that every Naruto fan is a pro-level arena fighting game player at this point, given the number of Ninja Storm games they've been faced with. One Piece: Burning Blood, Dragon Ball FighterZ, My Hero One's Justice, the ill-fated Jump Force — it seems to me that when you make a game based on a hit anime, the obvious move is to go for a fighting game.
Some of them are good, some of them are not, but boy... are there a lot of them.

At least it's (sea)faring better than three other unannounced Ubisoft games, which have been cancelled thanks to Ubisoft's general underperforming sails. Sorry, sales.

That slows down once you've got a few hours under your utility belt, but developers Second Dinner have some changes in the works that should make rarer cards easier to snag. If you're saving up for a particular card from the Token Shop, it's worth checking whether it's one of 9 cards that are about to get cheaper. 
The first "Series Drop" is due to land in an update on January 31st, which will also add a mode that lets you battle your buds.

Yes, its side-scrolling action is so buttery smooth it should come with a cholesterol warning. Its soundtrack is sublime. It looks gorgeous. But for me, the chewiest bit is the story.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Final Fantasy XVI is due out June 22 exclusively on PlayStation 5, but some fans believe a PC version of the game could release as soon as six months after its console debut. However, FF16 producer Naoki Yoshida isn't sure why. 
During a recent Final Fantasy XIV stream, Yoshida, who is a director on that game, was asked about rumors surrounding a PC version of FF16, and he responded, "I don't know where the notion of a PC version releasing six months after the game is out came from as none of us have ever said that," according to a translator, as reported by Eurogamer. He followed it up with two instances urging fans to buy the PS5 version. 
According to a translation by Siliconera, Yoshida also said, "There's been talk that the PC version will come out, but no one on the team has said anything about the PC version. I wonder why people assume the PC version will arrive six months after [the PS5 version], so just go ahead and buy a PS5." 
The talk of a PC version of the game stems from a promotional PlayStation 5 video released last year that says in small print that FF16 will be a "PS5 exclusive for six months." Some extrapolated from this small print that a PC release of the game will come after that six months of exclusivity is up, but if Yoshida's recent comments are any indication, the team has nothing to say in regards to a PC version. 
Final Fantasy XVI hits PlayStation 5 on June 22. While waiting for more information, watch this "Ambition" trailer that reveals more about Valisthea's kingdoms, dominants, and eikons, and then check out our interview with Yoshida about the game's boss fights.

"Nobody said a word about a PC version release," said Yoshi P, the producer on both FFXIV and FFXVI. "Why is it like a PC version is releasing 6 months later? Don't worry about that, buy a PS5!" he said, laughing.

We've been working under the assumption that Final Fantasy 16 would come to PC after a period of PlayStation 5 exclusivity, but in fairness, that's because that's what the Final Fantasy 16 trailers have said would happen.

So the JurassicFront replaces character models with dinosaurs, and away you go, shooting dinos around Naboo and the Death Star. That's the joke.

First revealed back in 2014, Dead Island 2 was in development at Spec Ops: The Line developer Yager, with Dead Island developer Techland having parted ways with the property to work on Dying Light. Publisher Deep Silver handed over development of the game to LittleBigPlanet 3 developer Sumo Digital in 2016, and then, in 2019, the company announced that Homefront: The Revolution developer Dambuster Studios would be developing Dead Island 2. It's now 2023 and Dambuster's Dead Island 2 is due out in April, finally.

The next 12 months is set to be a banner year for interstellar adventuring, and kicking us off in just under four weeks time on February 2nd is KeokeN Interactive's Deliver Us Mars. As I found out last year, Deliver Us Mars looks like it's going to be quite the step up from its prequel, Deliver Us The Moon, both in terms of its cerebral, pulse-racing puzzle-solving, and its shift from a silent, first-person protagonist to fully-voiced, third-person heroine, Kathy Johanson - a fact that game director and co-founder Koen Deetman tells me has been long in the making. 
"You have to bear in mind that Deliver Us The Moon was our debut into the games industry," he tells me. "We’d envisioned multiple ways to make this the greatest game of all time, but to some extent you are bound by reality and what you can make within a budget and timeline, so some of these decisions were made out of necessity. That’s why the narrative and its scale has significantly risen with Deliver Us Mars – we’ve had the opportunity to give that side of the game a lot of more of our time and attention."

Unlike the standard PS5 DualSense controller, however, Project Leonardo won’t be compatible with the PC when it eventually launches.


In a response to tech site Digital Trends, Sony Interactive Entertainment confirmed that the kit – which allows for extensive customisation of button layouts and joystick positioning – will be built exclusivly for the PS5, with no native support for the PC or older consoles like the PS4.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We’ve known for a few years that Gearbox’s sci-fi shooter Borderlands is being adapted for the silver screen, but shooting on the movie is now almost finished.

'Nuh uh', say Arkane, in a new interview with Games Radar. Redfall apparently has more in common with Far Cry than Valve's co-op classic.

Until now. As of right yesterday, Joe Danger Infinity and a mobile port of the original, Joe Danger Touch, are playable in your browser and completely free.

But next week, then we'll properly be back. Still, even this ragtag skeleton crew have managed to reel off 101 games we're looking forward to in 2023 (admittedly some are likely/hopefully this year).

It's about adding symbols to a slot machine, rather than removing monsters from a dungeon. You emerge from each run with sentences less like 'damn, if only I'd picked more block cards' and more like 'damn, if only I hadn't invested so much in coal and instead focused on feeding milk to my cats'.

In doing so they seem to have broken the cleanse effect attached to her Swift Step ability, meaning she can no longer purge debuffs. The bug appeared after yesterday's update and isn't mentioned in the patch notes, so yep, it's a bug rather than a balance change. Hopefully she'll get back to cleansing soon.

So when I say that I don't love Asterigos Colon Curse of the Stars, it's not as damning as it may sound.
You're Hilda, a stabby lass who, for reasons, must investigate and lift a curse from a big ol' fantasy city. By exploring its districts and stabbing lots of weird dudes. Aiding you is a network of semi-suspicious locals, and the kind of immortality that makes death more annoying than anything. It's a hybrid, really, of a Souls-ish game and a more traditional hack and slash action RPG. Regular attacks don't consume stamina, and instead of finding or buying weapons, you start out with a complete set, and swap their movesets in and out as needed. I respect that it picks and chooses soulsy elements instead of tracing over the whole design.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I knew Minecraft had an ending, but I didn't know that ending consists of an unskippable 9 minute long poem. I also didn't know that last month the author of that poem, Julian Gough, placed it into the public domain, which according to him he's legally entitled to do because nobody at Mojang or Microsoft ever successfully got him to sign a contract.
He now says Microsoft are stonewalling any attempts to contact them about whether or not they own the copyright, and that this silence killed a piece he'd written for an unnamed "global news organisation" because they didn't want to risk drawing the ire of Microsoft's 1700 strong lawer team. That piece was actually an edited version of Gough's blog post from last month, where he explained the situation and submitted the poem to the public domain - while making multiple references to the poem being written by the universe, and also how taking psychedelics lead him to conclude that not allowing himself to be compensated would be a "blockage of the flow of love". It's a trip.

If you’re unfamiliar, Forge is a long-time Halo mode that allows players to create their own custom maps and modes. In the past, players used Forge to remake classic maps or remix existing ones. But Infinite’s take on Forge is more robust, allowing forgers to create maps that don’t look like they belong in Halo. No, seriously, what is Whiterun doing in Infinite?

When I first asked the team to put together their most anticipated games for 2023, I was thinking we'd have a reasonably sensible number of things we were all looking forward to, you know, somewhere in the region of the 43 games we highlighted at the start of 2022. Very quickly, though, it became apparent that, actually, there are simply loads of games the RPS Treehouse is personally excited about this year, and cor, it would be rude not to include every last one of them. I'll be upfront: there are a fair number of TBA games on here that probably aren't going to come out in 2023, but as ever, we remain hopeful and optimistic all the same. So let's dive in.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Don't expect The Last of Us HBO show to extend beyond the story of the two games in the series. That's because The Last of Us game director Neil Druckmann says there are no plans for stories beyond the games in this show.
This news comes by way of a new interview with Druckmann from The Hollywood Reporter, as reported by GameSpot. Here's what Druckmann told THR specifically: "We have no plans to tell any stories beyond adapting the games. We won't run into the same issue as Game of Thrones since The Last of Us Part: II doesn't end on a cliffhanger." 


Druckmann and TV series writer Craig Mazin have mentioned that a second season of this show might cover the events of The Last of Us Part II (personally, I think The Last of Us Part II could cover two seasons of television). Despite the duo not wanting the show to go beyond the games, there might be a way for the show to cover more ground after the events of The Last of Us Part II. If Naughty Dog were to develop a theoretical The Last of Us Part III, it wouldn't be surprising if the HBO show covered that down the road. Chances seem pretty good considering Druckmann told THR that there is "more story to tell" in the world of The Last of Us games. 
Mazin also touched on his desire not to extend the show beyond the games in the THR interview, as noted by GameSpot, stating that he doesn't "have any interest in a spinning-plates-go-on-forever show." 
"When it becomes a perpetual motion machine, it just can't help but get kind of...stupid," he continued. "Endings mean everything to me." 
For more about The Last of Us on HBO, read our interview with Joel actor Pedro Pascal and Druckmann about the changes made for this TV show. Check out this new piece of concept art from The Last of Us multiplayer game that Naughty Dog is currently developing after that.

But perhaps more than any property that has moved from interactive medium to passive television, The Last of Us seems most suited to make the transition. Joel and Ellie’s story is an emotional and cinematic one that does not rely on player choice.
Ahead of the show’s premiere we spoke with some of the actors about the adaptation, as well as Neil Druckmann, co-creator of The Last of Us, who was heavily involved in writing the show and directed a few episodes.
Druckmann is no stranger to directing actors, even if the recording process of a TV show is different from how it works in a video game. “There is a certain luxury we have in video games that when we capture a performance, we have eve…]]></summary>

Players control Kai, a lone warrior battling an evil robotic army in a post-apocalyptic world. This side-scrolling action title boasts plenty of satisfying action thanks to Kai’s fun melee combat, nimble platforming abilities, and his signature grappling hook, which he uses to traverse levels as well as yank and toss enemies. Sporting great 16-bit art and a strong soundtrack, Gravity Circuit is worth keeping an eye on for fans of classic throwbacks.

Many JRPGs have slow openings, taking their time to establish the story and familiarize the player with the mechanics before letting them loose into the world. I figured that was the case after playing an hour of Dragon Quest Treasures, so I said to myself, “It’ll get good soon!” I said it again two hours in, three hours in, and five hours in, until eventually, I was forced to accept that this was as good as the game would get. Dragon Quest Treasures is never short on charm or style, but simple, sub-par combat and loot-hunting mechanics had me scraping the bo…]]></summary>

In 1999, Konami put the fear of fog in a generation of players with the release of Silent Hill. The eerie title eschewed the more bombastic horror of its main rival at the time, Resident Evil, in favor of more psychological frights. Protagonist Harry Mason must embark on a terrifying search for his missing daughter, Cheryl, within the eerie town of Silent Hill. What unfolds is a descent into madness that kickstarted a franchise that's (finally) returning to the limelight after years of dormancy. Join me, Marcus Stewart, along with Kyle Hilliard, as we survive Silent Hill’s debut adventure and see how its scares stack up 23 years later.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony released a sneak peek of its upcoming Gran Turismo movie yesterday evening during its CES 2023 press conference, and as expected, it features a lot of fast vehicles. 
Starring David Harbour (Stranger Things), Orlando Bloom (Pirates of the Caribbean, The Lord of the Rings), and David Barnet (Never Have I Ever), and directed by Neil Blomkamp (District 9, Elysium, Chappie), Gran Turismo is based on a true story. That story is about the GT Academy contest, which was a real contest held between 2008 and 2016 by Sony and Nissan. Winners were given entrance into Nissan's Driver Development Program, as noted by Video Games Chronicle. The film appears to be telling the tale of someone who won entrance into this program and then went on to become a real success in the racing world. 
Check out the Gran Turismo sneak peek for yourself below: 


As you can see, this sneak peek is a mix of what appears to be movie footage and behind-the-scenes footage, with stars like Harbour, Barnet, and Bloom talking about their excitement for the film. 
Gran Turismo hits theaters later this year on August 11. 
Alongside this sneak peek, Sony also revealed that Gran Turismo 7, the latest in the long-running series released last year, will be getting an update that makes the game playable on its upcoming PSVR2 platform. 
While waiting to learn more about this Gran Turismo movie, read about Project Leonardo, a new customizable accessibility controller kit PlayStation unveiled yesterday and then read about how the PlayStation 5 has surpassed 30 million units sold.

I had always observed the Fire Emblem series from a distance, worried its strategy gameplay wouldn’t be for me or stressed determining where best to start and how to play through the franchise’s various entries. Fire Emblem Three Houses was the first I gave a good try and 80-plus hours later, it’s one of my favorite games on Switch and turned me into a Fire Emblem fan. Since its reveal, I’ve looked at Fire Emblem Engage as a test bed: am I actually a Fire Emblem fan, or did I just really like Three Houses and its engaging Hogwarts-like school mechanics? If the 10 hours I’ve put into Engage so far are any indication, I’m happy to say it’s the former. 
Engage isn’t…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony Interactive Entertainment has revealed that it has sold more than 30 million PlayStation 5 units since the console's launch in 2020. 
This news comes by way of the company's recent CES 2023 appearance, where PlayStation CEO Jim Ryan revealed these numbers alongside words that seem to indicate the PS5 shortage might be over, or at least coming to an end soon. PlayStation also touched on its upcoming PSVR2 release and accompanying 30-plus game lineup, and pulled back the curtains on its new customizable accessibility controller kit, Project Leonardo. 
As you can see, it seems Ryan and PlayStation are confident in the supply of PS5 consoles around the world. If you're still on the lookout for one, it seems now is the time to start searching retail stores again.

The company revealed this during its CES 2023 presentation yesterday, stating that the kit is "designed to remove barriers to gaming and help players with disabilities play more easily, more comfortably, and for longer periods on PS5." It seems to be PlayStation's answer to Xbox's Adaptive Controller also aimed at accessibility for gamers. The company says it has worked with accessibility experts at organizations like AbleGamers, Special Effect, and Stack Up, as well as community members and game developers to design a controller kit like this that works "out of the box."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Last of Us turns 10 years old in June, and Naughty Dog plans to celebrate the milestone with an array of special announcements along the way. One of those updates involves a closer look at the upcoming standalone multiplayer title.
In a blog post, Naughty Dog co-president Neil Druckmann reflects on The Last of Us’ legacy as well as the franchise’s future. In addition to the HBO adaptation premiering on January 15 and the PC port of The Last of Us Part 1 hitting in March, Druckmann states fans will learn more about the long-awaited multiplayer experience that serves as a follow-up to the original game’s Factions mode. Druckmann writes,
“We’ll have some fun surprises for you along the way, but later this year we will begin to offer you some details on our ambitious The Last of Us multiplayer game. With a team led by Vinit Agarwal, Joe Pettinati, and Anthony Newman, the project is shaping up to be a fresh, new experience from our studio, but one rooted in Naughty Dog’s passion for delivering incredible stories, characters, and gameplay.”
Naughty Dog also shares a new piece of concept art, posted in full below, which is the first new material of the game since it released the first concept asset last June. It depicts two survivors heading toward a dilapidated cruise ship. 
Though we’ll be learning more about the game this year, it’s still unknown if Naughty Dog plans to launch it in 2023. That would be fitting given the anniversary, but we'll have to wait and see over the coming months. Until then, be sure to check out this feature on how The Last of Us Part 1 proves there's no such thing as a faithful remake.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wizards of the Coast, the company behind Dungeons & Dragons and Magic: The Gathering, has reportedly canceled five unannounced games alongside layoffs affecting "fewer than 15 people," according to a new Bloomberg report. 
The people that will lose their jobs will be given a chance to apply for new roles within WotC, but this apparent business restructuring will affect others outside of the company as well. Bloomberg reports that this reorganization will hit Otherside Entertainment and Hidden Path Entertainment, both working on games for WotC, hard. News of this change follows the release of Dungeons & Dragons: Dark Alliance's release last year, which didn't fare too well with critics and players, amidst Larian Studios' continued development on Baldur's Gate 3 (which does not seem to be affected by this reorganization despite WotC serving as the game's publisher). 
These two games, in part, represented WotC's bigger forray into the video game space as Bloomberg reports that the company had signed contracts with several studios to make games. WotC also "built at least six of its own game studios," according to the publication. 
One project in the works that is now canceled went under the codename "Jabberwocky," according to Bloomberg, and two more externally developed games early in development are no longer moving forward as well. These cancelations and layoffs comes as parent company Hasbro's shares fell 40% last year. 
Wotc told IGN that it remains "committed to using digital games as a cornerstone of our strategy for bringing our games to players around the world," adding that it has "made some changes to our long-term portfolio to focus on games which are strategically aligned with developing our existing brands and those which show promise in expanding or engaging our audience in new ways."

Roughly 300 QA workers at ZeniMax voted to indicate they wish to join this union, equating to a supermajority vote, and Microsoft has opted to recognize it. This lines up with what Microsoft said last month, where it announced that if these workers vote to unionize, it would voluntarily recognize the union.

With season 2 of Invincible set to premiere on Amazon Prime sometime this year, Fall Guys is whetting fans’ appetite with skins for Mark, Omni-Man, and Atom Eve. The outfits hit the in-game store on January 5, and that hopefully means a release date announcement for the series won't be too far behind.

Fall Guys enjoyed a bit of a renaissance in 2022. In addition to its usual deluge of seasonal content updates, it went free-to-play in May and launched on Xbox and Switch, gaining a larger player base of contestants and renewed interest in general. We look forward to seeing what 2023 brings for the title, but this is a pretty good start.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Polish developer The Astronauts have revealed a new trailer for their upcoming rogue-lite shooter Witchfire. In addition to showing off some new gameplay clips, it announces that the game will use NVIDIA DLSS3 technology, which a press release says will "massively boost performance." You can watch the trailer below.


Announced by NVIDIA last September, DLSS 3 can boost a game's performance by a significant margin. One demo on NVIDIA's site shows two instances of Cyberpunk 2077 running at 96 FPS with ray tracing still enabled. "DLSS 3 allows the seemingly impossible, high framerate without compromising the visuals," Adrian Chmielarz, creative director and co-founder of The Astronauts says in a press release. "A no brainer for a game like Witchfire, which is both action and beauty."
Witchfire is a dark fantasy first-person shooter from the creators of Painkiller, Bulletstorm, and The Vanishing of Ethan Carter. Set in an alternate reality, players are caught in the middle of a war between witches and the Church, and must use weapons and powers from Vatican sorcerers to defeat their enemies. 
The game is set to enter Early Access in the Epic Games Store sometime later this year, though that wasn't always the case. It was delayed last October because the team decided to overhaul the world's design and make it more open. This trailer is a good indication that the studio is still hard at work, though; here's hoping that "early 2023" ends up being as soon as possible.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[New year, new content: Cult of the Lamb is getting a "major content update" sometime in 2023. According to a Twitter thread posted to the official Cult of the Lamb account, this update will introduce features many players have requested, including accessibility improvements, quality-of-life features, new difficulty options, and more depth.
This Major Content Update will release in 2023 and be FREE to all players!

The biggest change they showcase in this thread is the introduction of heavy attacks, which can be activated by holding down the attack button. These are more than slow swings that do more damage; in Cult of the Lamb, every heavy attack has a unique effect. For example, the sword's heavy attack smashes the ground, doing an explosion of damage that harms any enemy caught in its range. Meanwhile, the dagger creates a line of knives that fall from the sky, and the axe can be thrown around like a boomerang. This is just the tip of the iceberg; developer Massive Monster says it's "just one small tidbit" of what's still to come.
The update should come soon, but not that soon. The last tweet of the thread clarifies that the developers are currently working on a patch to fix some console bugs and that the major update won't be released until after that. Their release window also isn't any more specific than "2023," so it could come out any time this year.
If you're interested in learning more about the game, you can check out our review.

        <updated>2023-01-03T15:24:03.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[IO Interactive has announced that Hitman 3 will become Hitman World of Assassination later this month and will include all levels from Hitman 1 and Hitman 2 in it for free. 
More specifically, this big update for the Hitman trilogy arrives on January 26 and includes two major changes: 
"Hitman 3 will become 'Hitman World of Assassination,' which will also include access to Hitman 1 and Hitman 2 through our existing Access Pass system. Current Hitman 3 owners will get a free upgrade to Hitman World of Assassination on all platforms."
"We're drastically simplifying the purchase experience for new players. Hitman World of Assassination will be the single experience option to start playing." 


This update makes it so that all Hitman 3 owners will have the same base content ownership, and it attempts to eliminate confusion over which edition to buy to obtain certain levels by making it so that there is only one purchase option. The other DLC will apparently still be available for purchase, but owning all the IO Interactive Hitman trilogy levels will be easier than ever now. 
Hitman World of Assassination will cost $70, and it includes Hitman 3, the Hitman 1 Game of the Year Access Pass, and the Hitman 2 Standard Access Pass. You can also purchase the Hitman World of Assassination Deluxe Pack for $30 to get the Hitman 3 Deluxe Pack, the Hitman 3 Seven Deadly Sins Collection, and the Hitman 2 Expansion Access Pass. 
"Those are the only two products that new players need to consider when buying any Hitman game digitially as of January 26, 2023," IO writes in a blog post. "The changes have also been made with the Freelancer game mode in mind, where being able to easily access all locations from across the World of Assassination is parmount to maximizing your enjoyment." 
In the meantime, read Game Informer's Hitman 3 review and then read about the new Hitman 3 Freelancer mode.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The long-in-development remake of System Shock will finally be released this March. 
This news comes by way of a new Kickstarter update from developer Nightdive Studios, which states the team has picked "a few last things to share before our quickly approaching launch window of March 2023." as reported by Video Games Chronicle. This remake, which is set to hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC has had a 2023 release year attached to it for a minute now, but this new Kickstarter update points attention to the game's Steam page, which now features a "March 2023" release window.

        <updated>2023-01-03T13:47:07.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Starbreeze Studios and publisher Koch Media have released a new teaser trailer that calls 2023 "the year of PayDay 3." Presumably, this means the co-op shooter is still on track to release sometime this year. 
Koch gave PayDay 3 a 2023 release window way back in March of 2021, detailing the game's new publishing deal alongside news that there is at least 18 months of post-launch support planned for the title. Later that year, in June, Koch released a new piece of concept art, citing that PayDay 3 will feature a "fully-fledged social heist universe" set within a Hollywood-like setting. That was the last we saw of PayDay 3 until yesterday, when IGN revealed the "official reveal trailer" for the game, although considering how little is shown in it, it's less of a reveal and more of a teaser. 
Check out this new PayDay 3 trailer below: 


As you can see, there's not much to this trailer other than it calling 2023 "the year of PayDay 3." Here's hoping that holds true. 
What do you hope PayDay 3 brings to the franchise? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-01-03T13:16:25.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Starfield, the new and upcoming sci-fi RPG from Skyrim makers Bethesda Softworks, was originally due out in November of 2022, but it was delayed to the first half of 2023 last May. Starfield was then a big part of an Xbox showcase last summer and during that showcase, Microsoft revealed that every game shown would be coming in the first half of 2023. 
Now, a new Bethesda support page for the game has reconfirmed this "first half of 2023" window, as spotted by Klobrille on Twitter.
"Starfield arrives exclusively on Xbox Series X/S and PC in the first half of 2023," the support page reads.
This isn't the biggest surprise; Xbox has discussed this release window for Starfield on two occasions before this support page, but it seems the company is really dedicated to getting it out in the coming months. 
While waiting for an official release date, read about why Bethesda's Starfield delay is key to its new-gen success and then check out this story about how your Starfield character will not have a voice. Read about how Starfield's ambitious scale might be worrisome after that and then read about how Xbox Series X/S first-party games will cost $70 starting this year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I made 12 little games (analog and digital) over the course of my MFA program. However, I dedicated most of that time to my thesis. By graduation, I’d worked as a writer/narrative designer on prototypes, vertical slices, documentation – you name it. And after many adjustments, my thesis even won a highly competitive grant to assist post-grad development! Short deadlines and secondary assignments led to high-stress periods, albeit in a controlled, academic environment, but the lessons about collaboration and creativity were invaluable.
It’s an ordinary school night, and I’m in a video call with my friend Jude. I watch them casually scroll through graffiti-adjacent concept art and brief clips of a passion project called Ponch: Cyberspace Investigator. They give me a rundown of the game’s mechanics, inspirations, and vibe, which includes phrases like “platformer,” “Ace Attorney-inspired dialogue puzzles,” “detective work,” and “hack the internet.” Read more...]]></summary>

DokeV feels like the “everything” video game, and it almost looks too good to be true. This delightfully colorful title is, among other things, part MMO, part open-world sandbox, part Pokemon, part Ghostbusters, and part llama-riding simulator.

Until you look around, then, all of a sudden, you can see through time.
I’m standing in the Shibuya ward of Tokyo, Japan, which, if it’s famous for anything, is its crosswalk, Shibuya Crossing, a massive scramble intersection allowing foot traffic to cross in all directions. For lack of a better analogy, you could call it Japan’s Times Square. You’ve seen it in everything about modern Japan ever. Read more...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Images of what appears to be a special The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom Switch OLED model have leaked online, but it's currently unclear if this is a real console or a believable fake. 
This news comes by way of Video Games Chronicle, which reports that the images of this console appeared on the Famiiboard forum last night from user Kysen. The user didn't provide many details about the potential special edition Switch, but as you can see in the images below, the photos are quite believable. There are pictures of the console, the packaging, the Joy-Con, and more.
Check out the possible leaked images of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom Switch OLED special edition for yourself below:

As you can see, it appears that this model of the Switch is real. However, elaborate and well-done fakes have been done before so there's no telling if this is actually real until we learn more information. It wouldn't be the most surprising thing ever, considering Nintendo tends to release special edition OLED models for big releases like this year's Splatoon 3 and Pokemon Scarlet and Violet. 
The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom hits Switch on May 12 so it might be a while before we learn if this special edition OLED model is real. In the meantime, check out our list of the biggest 2022 games delayed to 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Metal Gear Solid creator and Death Stranding director Hideo Kojima and Metal Gear Solid publisher Konami parted ways with each other back in 2015 and since then, there hasn't been a mainline entry in the famed MGS series (although there was the not-so-great Metal Gear Survive in 2018). 
While there's no reason to believe Kojima and Konami are teaming up again anytime soon, it seems the latter might be preparing for some kind of return to MGS. Longtime MGS producer Noriaki Okamura wrote in a recent issue of Famitsu that "2023 will be a year of many announcements," as reported by Gematsu. 
In this special end-of-the-year issue of Famitsu, multiple Japanese developers and producers wrote quick teases about what 2023 might hold for them. It's here where Okamura teased that 2023 will be a year of announcements for Konami Digital Entertainment. More specifically, he said "Other than [the educational edition of Momotaro Dentetsu announced last year], 2023 will be a year of many announcements," and that his keyword for 2023 is "long-awaited," as noted by Gematsu. 
Now, this could just be his way of saying that Konami, as a whole, will make some announcements and that maybe some of them will be long-awaited by fans. However, given that it's Okamura – a longtime MGS producer – saying this, there's reason to believe that maybe he's teasing a return to the MGS series. Perhaps we're getting a remake of one of the games, or maybe a new mainline entry. Only time will tell. 
In the meantime, read Game Informer's ranking of the Metal Gear Solid series.

Arc Raiders
Arc Raiders was set to be the debut title from Embark Studios, a team of ex-DICE talent led by former EA head Patrick Söderlund. The co-op shooter about fighting off robots from space made a splash during last year's Game Awards. In a surprising twist, however, Embark announced months later it was delaying Arc Raiders to next year to focus on launching another shooter pro…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Driller aka Space Station Oblivion (in the US), the FIRST supported game of the Freescape engine, is ready for public testing!
Published in 1987 by Incentive Software Limited, this revolutionary new engine allowed players to explore a solid 3D graphic environment with complete freedom of movement for the very first time in videogame history. 
A new threat emerges after humanity abandoned a dying Earth to establish a new home on planet Evath. Evath's moon Mitral has turned into a gigantic gas time bomb. A meteor is also due to impact Mitral in the next several hours. You were chosen to secure each of Mitral's 18 sectors by positioning a drilling rig over the gas pockets in each sector before the meteor strikes.
Solve challenging riddles by relying on geological clues, intuition, or good old trial and error. To survive your mission, find Rubicon crystals to restore energy and destroy (or avoid) the Laser Beacons and Skanners left behind by the Ketars. Good luck!
Our reimplemented engine features graphics using software (TinyGL) or hardware mode (OpenGL) at arbitrary resolution. The initial Driller support is limited to DOS (EGA mode), Amiga and AtariST releases, but we hope to be able to add more soon! Please contact us if you have some other release.
To play any of these supported releases, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker.
