The game has been in development for years and is itself a resurrection of an even older title, but the work is far from over. 


Through 2024, Predecessor has been released in beta for Xbox and PlayStation consoles, and Omeda Studios has introduced Brawl and Ranked Modes into the roster for players to enjoy. Even before then, though, starting in 2020, the game has been in the works, with new heroes and skins being added to the roster on a regular basis. Having played it for a while now, I believe its the link to the community that's given this game the momentum to reach this point.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following a deluge of criticism (including from yours truly), World of Warcraft's Radiant Echoes pre-patch event is getting some big tweaks today. In a blogpost over on the forums, community manager Kaivax breaks down the changes.


Less waiting, more rewards


Long story short, the event is going to have less waiting around and, when you do complete it, you'll get more rewards. 


Before the patch, you'd have to show up at the beginning of the 90-minute window to complete the event within a rotating zone. Once this event was finished (which took anywhere from 5 to 8 minutes), you were out of luck if you missed it. With this patch, the event will continuously refresh throughout the entire duration. In the active zone, scenarios will appear and, after defeating them, a boss will spawn. Rinse and repeat.


Image via Blizzard Entertainment.


If you do want to farm the lesser mobs that appeared in the zone once the event was over, those will be available in the other, "inactive" zones. 


Furthermore, rewards are being increased, and the weekly quests that rewarded 1,500 Residual Memories will now be daily across your account (to cut down on the urge to run the event across multiple alts). With bosses spawning so much more quickly and dropping the same loot, you should be getting a lot more event gear from drops alone, so those memories can be put to good use buying the event's mounts and pets. 


Leave it to Blizzard to outdate my blogpost in just 24 hours, but as Kaivax says, "we hear you!"

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Mystery of the Unicorns challenge in Hitman World of Assassination is fairly simple to complete, provided you have good map knowledge. Without it, you'll struggle, which will make any Silent Assassin attempt even more difficult. 


Developer IO Interactive added the Mystery of the Unicorns challenge to Hitman World of Assassination as part of the game's Summer 2024 update. It gives you a new reason to revisit Dartmoor, though not as you might first think. Instead, this challenge is firmly locked to The Dartmoor Garden Show mission. This is the game's only main Escalation Mission type, which is a staple part of the story and not a smaller chunk of a standard location because it contains a completely revamped version of the main map.

Stardock and Ironclad revealed today that the full 1.0 release will be hitting Steam on August 15.

Even though I knew about the Early Access period on Epic Games Store, I always planned to wait until it fully released out of Early Access to give the sequel a try. When it reached that period back in 2023, I was so swamped with other games I figured I'd wait until it got some post-release love to pick it up.

One such weapon only comes around once in a while but can be excellent with the right setup. Here's the best roll for the Warden's Law hand cannon in Destiny 2.

      <p>Squirrel with a Gun is an evocative title, and this wacky sandbox platformer by Dee Dee Creations lives up to its namesake. You do, in fact, control a seemingly ordinary squirrel who wields human-sized guns (and other weapons like a rocket launcher) to blast shady government agents while bouncing around a physics sandbox. It's a strange and silly game, and you can watch editors Marcus Stewart and Charles Harte attempt to rationalize this exclusive gameplay montage.&nbsp;</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[That one guy in the group always doodling a dingus will be pleased, as the Jackbox Naughty Pack seems to be encouraging it this time around with three new games. Fakin' It All Night Long, Dirty Drawful, and Let Me Finish will likely leave us in stitches when they launch sometime in September. 




Yes, you will be Fakin' It All Night Long!


The social deduction game Fakin' It returns in this All Night Long version as the faker tries to blend in as the participants tell the truth and perform a secret task. The idea is that you have to become the best liar in your group. This naughty version of the game will have new categories and an all-new remote play mode. 


Dirty Drawful marks a return to the popular Jackbox game over the years but adds spicier prompts into the equation. Described as "both terrible and titillating," to the point in which an undo button has been added to the game. If you haven't played Drawful before, it's like Pictionary, but everyone tries to fool other players into choosing their guess/answer. If another player chooses your option instead of the real answer, you'll get points.

The only new game added to the Jackbox Naughty Pack is Let Me Finish. It's a debate-style presentation game, in which you're answering odd questions, such as which "meat" most likely wants to be called daddy, for example. In the trailer, seven different meat sticks are shown and you have to choose which one is the daddiest. Another question asks, "How does this avocado get aroused?" I've got nothing, but surely know someone that'll bring the snark. 


The Jackbox Naughty Pack is heading to consoles and PC sometime in September 2024 for $21.69. Ahhh, we see what you did there, Jackbox.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Takefusa Kubo FUTTIES SBC is now live in EA FC 24, and you can obtain the special card for your Ultimate Team squad.


The Japanese winger has had a sensational season for Real Sociedad, and he's now part of the FUTTIES promo. All players have equal chances to get the item by completing the SBC. Let's take a look at what you need to do to get the card, and if you should invest your resources at all. 


EA FC 24 Takefusa Kubo FUTTIES SBC tasks


The Takefusa Kubo FUTTIES SBC is really easy to complete. It has just two tasks, and the conditions are pretty reasonable as well. There are plenty of different ways to get the fodder required to complete this SBC in EA FC 24. 


Task 1 - Top Form



Min. 1 Players: Any TOTS or TOTW


Min. Team Rating: 88



Task 2 - LaLiga



Min. 1 Players from: LALIGA EA SPORTS


Min. 1 Players: Any TOTS or TOTW


Min. Team Rating: 89



EA FC 24 Takefusa Kubo FUTTIES SBC solutions


Here are the solutions for completing the Takefusa Kubo FUTTIES SBC. 


Task 1 - Top Form



Mapi Leon: 89


Cucho Hernandez TOTS: 88


Victor Osimhen: 88


Mikel Oyarzabal: 88


Marie Katoto: 88


Jan Oblak: 88


Joshua Kimmich: 88


Lucy Bronze: 87


Lina Magull: 87


Gianluigi Donnarumma: 87


Lea Schuller: 86



Task 2 - LaLiga



Erling Haaland: 91


Bremer TOTS: 91


Marc Andre Ter Stegen: 89


Ruben Dias: 89


Rodri: 89


Sandra Panos: 87


Lena Oberdorf: 87


Ewa Pajor: 87


Gregor Kobel: 87


Martin Odegaard: 87


Lautaro Martinez: 87



This Kubo item is pretty interesting for its price. It has four good playstyles, and the H/M work rate is pretty decent. The presence of 5* Weak Foot is a bonus, but the Shooting (91) and Passing (93) require boost. I think the card is well-worth the completion cost. It's a more economical alternative to the Paulo Dybala FUTTIES SBC.

I had my initial doubts about it, given that past DLCs haven't exactly hit the mark. But after spending around a week with it, any uncertainty I had was thrown out the door. 


The minute I stepped into this new pack, I immediately noticed a change in romantic relationships. It refreshes the Sims 4's age-old mechanics and instills a much more realistic concept. Simply put, it makes the dating world exceptionally entertaining, with a sprinkle of mature content. Sorry, kids, you'll have to sit this one out.

The Non-Denouement, for example, a bow from the Salvation's Edge raid, isn't that great on its own. However, two specific perks can turn it into a budget version of the Trinity Ghoul exotic bow. Combined with another handy exotic, it can make for a sweet combo. 


This is no different for other weapons, including a particularly interesting pulse rifle, the Nullify. If you're looking to make some major upgrades,  here's how to get the god roll for the Nullify pulse rifle in Destiny 2.

The biggest additions with Apex Legends Season 22 Shockwave are the new map and dual-wielding. E-District, as the neon-soaked map is called, is reminiscent of a cyberpunk Tokyo, and Respawn explains that it's got a lot of verticality for players to practice their skills in. Of course, this season's main highlight will be dual-wielding, which you can do with P2020s and Mozambiques. If that doesn't change the meta in a meaningful way, I don't know what will.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The first gameplay trailer for NBA 2K25 has dropped, and there are some massive changes in the pipeline.


To start things off, the ProPLAY feature will include over 9,000 new animations, which will be available on next-gen platforms. Additionally, developer Visual Concepts has revamped several core features from NBA 2K24 to offer a far more immersive experience. Plus, you can access the game two days early, if you decide you want to pre-order it.




NBA 2K25's offense and defense to get a boost from ProPLAY expansion


Visual Concepts has built on last year's ProPLAY feature, by expanding it with new animations.



The all-new Dribble Engine will include 1,500 dribbling animations. According to the developers, this is the biggest change to the gameplay engine, and the new system will try to replicate how NBA stars dribble their opponents in real life.


Over 1,100 signature shot animations will help you perform the same throws that Stephen Curry and co. do in NBA games.


Shot timing profiles have been revamped, and a new shot cancel feature will be added.


Players will be able to create more visual cues and use the right stick shooting to score more baskets.


In defense, there will be a brand new defensive cutoff system. Players can use the right stick to cut off an attack.





NBA 2K25's AI gameplay will also undergo changes in several areas to better complement the game. To make matters easier for all, the Learn 2K mode will be a one-stop destination if you're new to the franchise and looking to learn all the concepts.


NBA 2K25 early access plans revealed


If you pre-order the game before September 6, you can get up to two days of early access. Branded as "early tip-off", this offer will be available on all editions and include both next and current-gen.

Aero the Acro-Bat returns to the Big Top tomorrow, 2nd August 2024. But that isn't the end of the acrobatic bat's return to the stage. Ratalaika Games has revealed that it's rereleasing every single Aero the Acro-Bat game on Switch (and other consoles) over the next few months.
Following the first game's release, Aero The Acro-Bat 2 will arrive on 6th September; spin-off Zero the Kamikaze Squirrel will glide onto consoles on 4th October; and the GBA title Aero the Acro-bat: Rascal Rival Revenge rounds out the quartet on 1st November. That means, for the first time, all of the Aero the Acro-Bat games will be available digitally on modern consoles. Not bad for an oft-forgotten platformer from the SNES days, hey? Let's have a look at each of the games.

Major exports: traffic jams, because I've laid out my village in the form of a small crescent leading back to the freeway, which means that there are two traffic light junctions about 100 metres apart.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you actively played Monopoly GO during its previous Making Music season, you may remember just how often Wild Stickers would appear during events. These cards would often make or break sets, especially if you were just a few stickers away from completing the album and winning its grand prize. Although Monopoly Games' events have yet to reward any of these, this changes today with the introduction of City Racers, the sequel to Tycoon Racers.


Although Tycoon Racers has been in the works for months, it made its first worldwide debut in June 2024, with yet another Wild Sticker as a grand prize. Now, with City Racers live on August 1, the first Wild Sticker opportunity of Monopoly Games is here. However, if you're familiar with Tycoon Racers, you'll know how challenging it is to get first place, especially if you're up against a coordinated team who gets very lucky with their points rolls.

Wild Stickers are well-known for making sticker sets a cakewalk to finish if you consistently finish events that have them. They're one of the most helpful items in Monopoly GO, especially if you need rare golden stickers and can't find any Golden Blitz events. 


In the Making Music season, you could also find Wild Stickers in Peg-E's prize drop minigame, Tycoon Racers, and Partners events. Although Peg-E's minigame and Partners are somewhat easy to finish if you actively participate in events and have good teammates, Tycoon and City Racers are more challenging. Nonetheless, if you want to experience the first Wild Sticker appearance this season, City Racers is where you'll find it.


City Racers has a team-building grace period from August 1 to August 2, with the races starting at noon ET. From here, you'll have a few days to collect flags and participate in three races for a chance at the Wild Sticker, Speedy Scottie board token, and two sticker packs as the grand prize.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Specimen ID quests in Destiny 2 Episode Echoes have been lovely additions to the core story up until this one. That's not to say that Specimen ID: NES006 is bad at all; it's just one of the longest grinds you'll have worked through since the first Episode was released. 


This quest was released alongside the final part of A Rising Chorus: Act II in Destiny 2. It's one of the few quests you'll have to unlock without being prompted by the game. Instead, you've got to find the initial trigger and then work through it from there. As I've alluded to, this quest is a real slog, so if you want to complete it in one go, I suggest you clear a few hours in your schedule because you'll be playing for a good long while.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With The Arcadion (Savage) raid tier making its debut in Final Fantasy XIV, there's been plenty of chatter around encounter design and what makes some of these fights really shine. Amid the discussions, you may see the term ‘door boss’ come up fairly often, but what does that mean?


For anyone who isn’t deep into FFXIV terminology, the term can be a little confusing. In short, a door boss is the first boss in a two-phase duty. Defeating this first boss creates a kind of checkpoint in the middle of the fight. When your enemy's HP hits zero, there's typically a cutscene and a new boss form. 


Is this annoying? Sure, but it's got its benefits. If the party wipes from this point on, you'll start the fight over from the middle as long as you don't leave the duty or run out of time. Should you…]]></summary>

When is the next Community Day in Pokémon Go?


According to the official Pokémon Go page, the next Community Day will be Aug. 31 from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. local time. The featured Pokémon for this event will be the Water type, Popplio.

More specifically, Bungie has now clarified that it's going to skip the weekly This Week in Destiny blog post in light of the unprecedented layoffs that happened this week. Well, it's not wholly unprecedented if I'm being honest, as something similar happened ahead of The Final Shape's late-2023 delay.

The Ace Attorney Investigations Collection, comprising the first and second games in the Edgeworth-focused spin-off, is coming out in September, the same year as the Apollo Justice Trilogy – and we've got a tasty little preview-slash-Q&A to whet your appetite.
We've been playing the games for around a month now, and we're about halfway through each one. We've played Investigations before, when it came out on the DS in 2010, but this is the first time that Investigations 2, now known as Prosecutor's Gambit, has been translated officially for a release outside of Japan.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hardened battle royalists will remember Caldera, the sandy island map of bunkers and palm trees in Call Of Duty: Warzone. It got shut down last year as Activision focused their efforts elsewhere, making the map unplayable. But you can now revisit those bullet-strewn beaches. In theory, anyway. Activision have released it as a 4GB open-source project that can be explored in a 3D model-viewing tool. That's cool. But among their reasons for doing so, there lies a predictably grubby logic: they want people to use the data to train AI.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This Mars has no bite.
When Nintendo launched Metroid Dread in 2021, there was no doubt in our minds that it would inspire more fast-paced, gritty Metroidvanias later down the road. MARS 2120 is one such title; a sci-fi romp that attempts to capture the same magic that made Dread so special, but ultimately falls at almost every hurdle.
It starts off strong, taking place on the surface of Mars where you’re fleeing from an avalanche of rocks and rubble. It’s exciting stuff, but even during this introductory sequence, something about the controls just felt off. You’re blessed with a double-jump ability right from the start, but executing it never feels quite natural enough considering how often you’ll need to use it throughout the game. It’s not bad, as such, but it feels a bit too floaty for our liking.

“A British transport joke!” I said to myself, marinating in the sufficient amount of crown-mandated mild amusement. “Our organ-floggingly expensive yet vital public services are crap!” I was having a good time. Then the game public transported me straight to my desktop, and continued to do so at regular intervals over the next few hours, ranging from “just as this conversation was getting good” to “just as my save was about to load.” My upper lip almost quivered, I tell you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Well, would you look at that! I just got done pining for the merest whiff of Dungeon Keeper when what should appear on Steam but a free prologue for delightful voxel-arty management sim Dungeon Tycoon. I’m using the word ‘appear’ because, following yet more industry layoffs yesterday, I’m choosing to adopt the brain of an idiot as to shield myself from the crushing reality of material conditions. So, anyway, the magical game goblins whacked the demo on Steam, and I’ve been having a lot of fun with it. Thanks, adequately compensated and unionised gobbos!

Still, on the day Pleasurewood Hills mascot Woody Bear is taken by the soil, I will jig and whoop under the moon. I actually cannot remember when the beef started, but my mum reliably informs me that I was terrified to tears by this bear as a child. He yet survives, but mark my words: when the Woody Copters finally fall from their rusted hinges, I will salt the earth.

We have known for a while that Shin chan: Shiro and the Coal Town would be getting a Western release (publisher Neos confirmed it after it was revealed in Japan's September 2023 Direct), but we didn't know exactly when. Until today! The publisher has finally shared that this one will be coming to Western Switches on 24th October, with Limited Run Games handling a physical release.
This one launched in Japan back in February (with the 'Shiro of Coal Town' title) and sees things take a more mysterious turn than 2022's catchily titled Shin chan: Me and the Professor on Summer Vacation -The Endless Seven-Day Journey-. You and your good boi friend will explore the potentially fictitious 'Coal Town' all while getting stuck into the slice-of-life gameplay with bug hunting, fishing and crafting.

The individual with the best run for 'Donkey Kong Barrel Roll' (with an 'S' rank and time of 00:15:68) has used the "invisible ladder glitch" to set this leaderboard record. We've reviewed the replay in the game and can confirm it's the winning run.

      <p>The 2002 Star Wars: Bounty Hunter video game is being updated and making its way to modern consoles and PC, and we decided to give it a look.</p>

<p>The original game, now more than 20 years old, was released on GameCube and PlayStation 2, and this new version adds all kinds of interesting bells and whistles. According to developer Aspyr, this version is a native port of the GameCube version of the game, as opposed to an emulation. The game also features contemporary controls and and overhauled camera system.</p>

<p>You can watch the video for our full impressions and play (or replay it) on August 1 on PlayStation 4 and 5, Xbox One and Series X/S, Switch, and PC.</p>

Don't laugh: I know you do this too. Kletka isn't helping: created by in404, it's a horror scavenging game reminiscent of Lethal Company and Golden Light, in which you ponderously plummet through the layers of an "endless" post-Soviet Gigastructure, scrounging fuel, parts and provender for an elevator that wants to eat you.

This has less to do with GTA in itself, Vermeij says, than with the fact that changes in computing capacity today simply aren't as dramatic as in the days of the very first PlayStation.

It’s also got just sitting on a bench, enjoying some lovely serene space scenery.  Feast your famished face on the trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Update: Garry Newman has confirmed that the DMCA notice was sent last year, and has since been "all resolved", in an email to IGN.
Original story:
Earlier this month it was reported that Skibidi Toilet, the YouTube phenomenon, may be heading to film and television via director Michael Bay. Now Invisible Narratives, a production company co-owned by Bay, has apparently sent a DMCA takedown notice to Garry Newman, citing the large number of Skibidi Toilet games and assets advertised within Garry's Mod.

</p>


      <p>A new trailer for Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero takes aim at Dragon Ball Z’s earliest story arcs, the Saiyan and Namek sagas. New characters from both eras will be joining the roster.&nbsp;</p>

<p>New fighters include members of both the Ginyu and Frieza Forces (remember Cui?), the Namakian warrior Nail, and every form of Frieza during the Z era. Perhaps most hilariously, you can even play as one of the Saibamen, meaning we get to watch it blow up Yamcha all over again, which never gets old.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here's the full list of new fighters joining the roster:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Captain Ginyu</li>
	<li>Chiaotzu</li>
	<li>Cui</li>
	<li>Dodoria</li>
	<li>Frieza (Z), 1st Form</li>
	<li>Frieza (Z), 2nd Form</li>
	<li>Frieza (Z), 3rd Form</li>
	<li>Frieza (Z), 4th Form</li>
	<li>Frieza (Z), Full Power</li>
	<li>Guldo</li>
	<li>Nail</li>
	<li>Nappa</li>
	<li>Raditz</li>
	<li>Recoome</li>
	<li>Saibaman</li>
	<li>Zarbon</li>
	<li>Super Zarbon</li>

Real-time movement and exploration? Rotatable polygons? Pfff. These are firmly pre-rendered worlds, just like Grandpappy Atrus used to bake.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There’s a new version of AMD Fluid Motion Frames (AFMF) available to try, and good news for Radeon GPU owners: it is drastically, almost comically better than the original version. Whereas AMD’s first take on driver-level frame generation – the same kind of framerate-roiding image generation trickery that FSR 3 and DLSS 3 are based around – came yoked to a barrel of jittering, stuttering, and visual artefacting issues, Fluid Motion Frames 2 is as smooth and you’d like. Without compromising on the ability to deploy it in theoretically any DirectX 11- or 12-based game, too.

      <p><a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/the-game-awards-2023/2023/12/07/after-15-years-visions-of-mana-revives-the-series">Visions of Mana</a> is a month away from release, but anxious players can get an early taste starting today, thanks to a free demo. Available now on PlayStation consoles, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, this playable slice lets players experience the game’s first chapter and a big boss fight.</p>

<p>The demo begins in the middle of Chapter 1 at Rime Falls and takes players through areas such as Fallow Steppe and Rhata Harbor. The chapter’s final boss, the Kraken, awaits the playable party of Val, Careena, and Morley.&nbsp;</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" frameBorder="0"  allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AHIJtLufSsM" width="640"></iframe>

<p>Unfortunately, save data will not transfer from the demo to the full game. Square Enix states this is because the final version of this section has been altered “for a more satisfying experience.” Instead, those with save data from the demo who purchase the full game will receive three weapons for Val upon reaching Chapter 1: Gladius, Falx, and Horn Lance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>First revealed at The Game Awards 2023, Visions of Mana marks the first original Mana entry in 15 years. Set in a vibrant, semi-open, fully 3D world, the adventure stars Val, who travels to the Mana Tree alongside his lifelong friend Hinna. You can watch the game’s most recent trailer <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/06/12/visions-of-mana-gets-august-release-date-in-new-trailer">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Visions of Mana launches on August 29 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PC.</p>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[British comedy is too often defined by its relationship to America: either as merely irony and sarcasm, which we're told Americans don't understand, or as a sprightly ideas factory for works such as The Office, which Americans can bless by re-making at scale.

Peel back the curtains of American cultural hegemony however and you may find the true pulsing core of British comedy that lies beneath: innuendo. No American network is in a bidding war to import Vic and Bob or remake Bottom, and Carry On and Benny Hill are assumed to be anachronisms in our modern times, but Thank Goodness You're Here! enters the conversation with a nudge and a wink. It's a cheeky 2-3 hour adventure through a small northern town, and it's here to educate the entire world of our nation's obsession with sausages and bare bottoms.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Edwin spotted this game called Beta Decay that's not got a release date yet or anything, but looks very cool. It's being developed by Rotoscope Studios and it's a low-poly, 90s-inspired mix of dystopian RPG, survival, third and first-person shooter, with some roguelike bits slapped in there, as well. Whew, that's a lot. Potentially too much. But hey, I am here for something ambitious and interesting, of which it ticks both boxes.

Well, funnel all that anticipation into your mouse-clicking finger, because developers Square Enix have just put up a playable demo of the bright JRPG on Steam. I'm not sure how much the demo offers, as we're only told it includes "a section of the story, battles and exploration." But that's better than nothing, and with a full month before release, you have plenty of time to scope it out.

A Roomba capable of tunnelling through miles of procedurally generated, monster-infested crust so as to reorganise the Earth's core and bring about its ultimate objective - a sparkling living room. I enjoy the militant reductiveness of this character motivation. There are sprawling underground ecosystems to discover, yes, weird plants to harvest, fractious clumps of tentacles to appraise, avoid or slaughter. But all of these things are contemptible details to be swept up and bagged and thrown in the dumpster.

      <p>Last month, we learned Sega and Amazon had partnered to create a <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/06/04/like-a-dragon-yakuza-live-action-series-hits-amazon-prime-video-this-october">live-action series based on the Like a Dragon</a> (formerly Yakuza) series. Over the weekend, during the San Diego Comic-Con, the studio unveiled the first teaser trailer.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Like A Dragon: Yakuza</em> centers on Kazuma Kiryu (played by Takeuchi Ryoma) and follows his life during two time periods: 1995 and 2005. Set in the series’ fictional Tokyo district of Kamurochō, the trailer’s synopsis states the show “depicts the lives of fierce yet passionate gangsters and people” and will explore stories the games haven’t been able to.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The six-episode series will be released on Prime Video in two parts, with the first three episodes premiering on October 24 and the last three arriving on November 1. It will be subbed and dubbed in 30 languages. <em>Like a Dragon: Yakuza</em> is directed by Take Masaharu (<em>100 Yen Love</em>).</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Overwatch 2 director Aaron Keller has posted a lengthy blog on Steam about the transition from 6v6 player matches in the first Overwatch to 5v5 in the poorly received free-to-play sequel. It's a juicy read for armchair designers and lapsed Overwatchers like myself, packing in analysis of class roles and the shift from the free choice of heroes to single hero picks and enforced team compositions.
In broad strokes, Keller summarises how the Overwatch experience has drifted away from "player freedom and creativity in order to create a more balanced, consistent and competitive experience for players". It's possible, however, that Overwatch 2 will swing back in the other direction, as Blizzard are now "exploring how we can test different forms of 6v6 in the game to gauge the results", with a view to restoring some of the joyful chaos that saw entire teams of Reinhardts charging the objective in formation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The story of Mortal Kombat games in recent years has been a mish-mash of double-crosses, weird friendships, and alternate dimension wobbles. They often feel like a casualty of Marvel movie bloat. Mortal Kombat 1 was marketed as a "reboot", for example, but is really just a continuation of previous nonsense, with developers NetherRealm saying "I don't know, stick a multiverse in it." Yet from that multiverse now arrives another bad guy, bringing new story chapters for the fighting game's first big expansion, as well as extra characters like the liquid metal murderer from Terminator 2, a Conan of the barbarian persuasion, and the masked killer of the Scream movies.

I return from holiday to find that Nic, James and the others have been experimenting with the use of Maw-shaped sock puppets to feed the Maw, in the hope that the Maw might form a filial bond with our news-wranglers. Unfortunately, we've learned in the process that anything that resembles the Maw behaves like the Maw. The sockpuppets were last seen tunnelling towards Los Angeles, like the sandworms in Dune. Sorry, America! Anyway, let's have a looksie at the PC game release sheets.

However, with Axel Springer's reformulated claims now rooted firmly in copyright law, the stakes are high at Germany's highest court.

The free iOS music streaming tool has millions of happy users, but is branded a parasitic threat by the music industry.

"If you play that right now," he said, "there is no compass, no map, literally the quests are like 'go to the third tree on the right and walk 50 paces west'... And if you did that now, no one would play it. Very few people would play it." Well sir, have you heard of a little open world RPG called Dread Delusion? It's pretty good. And what's more, it has just added a whole new area with - let me see - a giant floating squid creature with an entire town of citizens living inside its shell.

</p>


      <p>In Date Everything, those looking for romance don’t need to look any further than their refrigerator, smoke alarm, or dining room table. That’s because this wacky sandbox dating sim by developer Sassy Chap is all about forming relationships with everyday household objects that, it turns out, are actually pretty hot.</p>

<p>The game bestows players with special “Dateviator” glasses that allow them to speak with objects and see them in their true, absurdly attractive forms. Dozens of objects await your affection – even elements like air and water can be courted – and branching dialogue can lead to three relationship resolutions for each character (Love, Friend, Hate). Whatever you decide will be reflected in the ever-changing 3D overworld that is your house.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Date Everything boasts over 100 voiced characters played by performers that include Felicia Day (<em>Critical Role</em>, <em>Supernatural</em>), Johnny Yong Bosch (<em>Mighty Morphin Power Rangers</em>, <em>Bleach</em>), and Grey DeLisle (<em>Scooby-Doo, Avatar: The Last Airbender</em>). Given the huge amount of speaking roles, Date Everything boasts 1.2 million words and 70,000 voiced lines.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Date Everything looks delightfully silly, but it unfortunately doesn’t have a release window. It will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC.</p>]]></summary>

</p>


      <p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard is one of the year’s biggest RPGs, and now players will be able to take it on the go. BioWare has updated the game’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1845910/Dragon_Age_The_Veilguard/">Steam page</a> to confirm it’s been verified for Steam Deck.</p>


<blockquote class="tw-align-center twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">We're making great progress towards our fall launch date, and can confirm early that <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DragonAge?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#DragonAge</a>: The Veilguard is going all-in on <a href="https://twitter.com/Steam?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Steam</a> features!<br />
⚔️We're verified on Steam Deck.<br />

<p>As spotted by <a href="https://x.com/Hrungry/status/1816450818658500668">Hrungr on X</a>, this means that The Veilguard will be fully functional on Valve’s handheld, which has not been confirmed until now. Consider this a quick PSA for PC players who enjoy playing their role-playing games on the small(ish) screen.&nbsp;</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl, the beautifully grotty sci-fi shooter sequel from Ukrainian studio GSC Game World, has been delayed once again. It’s a relatively good-spirited delay, though: first off, it’s not that long, with the previously planned September 5th launch pushed back just a few weeks to November 20th. There’s also clever little in-universe announcement video (one which gives the fourth wall a study kick on its way out), and an accompanying promise of a meaty "developer deep dive video", set to reveal much more of the game’s radioactive hellscape on August 12th.

Not only from larger studios like Arkane, keeping the faith alive with their time loops and space stations, but also from a bunch of smaller developers bravely exploring a typically ambitious genre. RPS has always had an affinity for these systemically luxuriant simulations, historically lauding the likes of the original Deus Ex as the best game ever made. But given everything that has come since, is that still the case? Only one way to find out: make a big list.

There, got it right in the end. We've known about the development of this terror-heavy tourist attraction since its announcement early this year. But now the upcoming horror sim has been given an autumn release date in a new trailer.

But, despite all appearances, this one isn’t actually turn-based at all. A tiley, tiny real time strategy then? Aye, and one that’s actually pretty frantic as it happens. Missions are snappy, intense skirmishes. You’ll fight off waves while trying to protect your useless, freeloading command vehicle. This threat, combined with on-the-fly tactical consider-me-do's like utilising cover and keeping rock-paper-scissors matchups in your favour ends up spawning something quite distinct. Please, do stomp on, preferably with less hypens for all our sakes.

      <p>We’re not far off from the August 9 premiere of <em>Borderlands</em>, and Lionsgate is giving the final hard sell for the upcoming adaptation in the form of a new trailer.</p>

<p>Like the first game, <em>Borderlands</em> centers on a group of gun-toting Vault hunters searching for treasure on the planet Pandora.&nbsp;They also get roped up to save a mysterious girl who holds the key to a great power. If you’re still not sure what to make of the film after watching its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/gamer-culture/2024/02/21/the-borderlands-movies-first-trailer-looks-as-ridiculous-as-the-games">first trailer</a>, hopefully, this last preview will help you decide whether or not you’ll be making the trip to theaters in a couple of weeks to see it.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Borderlands</em> is directed by Eli Roth and stars Cate Blanchett (Lilith), Kevin Hart (Roland), Arianna Greenblatt (Tiny Tina), Jack Black (Claptrap), Edgar Ramírez (Atlas), Florian Munteanu (Krieg), Gina Gershon (Moxxi), and Jamie Lee Curtis (Tannis).</p>]]></summary>

And for some, it'll deliver what's needed: a fairly good time. A time marked by a loop that does hack 'n slash, management, and a dash of base repairs to an average degree.

      <p>Last year's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III will be available on Xbox Game Pass tomorrow, July 24. This marks the next big Activision Blizzard title to join the service.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The move comes less than a year after Modern Warfare III launched last November and represents the fruit of Microsoft's $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard last year. It’s also the biggest AB title to appear on Game Pass since <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/03/19/marchs-xbox-game-pass-line-up-has-diablo-iv-and-cars-galore">Diablo IV was added to the library</a> in March.</p>

<p>This gives subscribers a chance to check out last year’s entry before 2024’s installment, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/preview/2024/06/09/hoping-to-sprint-in-the-right-direction">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a>, launches on Game Pass on October 25. It also comes ahead of the new <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/07/10/price-increases-and-new-tiers-are-coming-to-xbox-game-pass">Game Pass price increases and subscription tier</a> arriving in September, a move the FTC <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/07/19/the-ftc-pushes-back-against-xbox-game-pass-price-increases">has taken issue with</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the heyday of Sierra's adventure game years, there was a series called Space Quest that featured an intergalactic janitor named Roger Wilco. The series was more satirical than King's Quest, less preachy than Police Quest, and not quite as adult as Leisure Suit Larry. Spearheaded by Scott Murphy and Mark Crowe - a pair of devs who called themselves "Two Guys from Andromeda" - Space Quest was renowned for its humour, and there was a nice sense of progression throughout most of the series, with Roger Wilco leveling up from working class spaceman to the head of his own Star Trek ship.

      <p>Dead by Daylight (DBD) has been one of the most popular multiplayer games (and horror titles in general) since its launch in 2016, but fans have dreamed of experiencing its universe in a single-player format. Developer Behaviour Interactive agreed and enlisted the cinematic storytelling expertise of Supermassive Games (Until Dawn, The Dark Pictures Anthology, The Quarry) to create an original story in the DBD universe. That game became The Casting of Frank S…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Between Against The Storms’ critters, Manor Lords’s perfect oxen, and now Cataclismo, Hooded Horse’s roster of strategy games share a common thread that many guard-the-village-em-ups can fatally overlook: they present a civilisation that’s worth protecting. Even if the fallen culture you’ll defend against waves of gribblies offers fascinatingly few concrete details on its origins, there’s a lithe and impressionistic otherworldliness and use of colour in Cataclismo’s art that evokes unearthed layers of history. Also, everyone is just so gosh darn likeable, with their foppish hats plopped atop stretched bodies, and dialogue that remains resolute, chirpy, and eager, even when you’re click-marching these poor folk straight to their deaths.
Still, none of this will stop me will sacrificing every last man, woman, and child of these beleaguered warriors if it means preserving a single one of my immaculately crafted staircases.

That's right: Valve have added some new crates just outside of counter-terrorist spawn, near bombsite A. This means that players can now use these boxes to hop from CT up to catwalk with little fuss, where previously you'd need to use your teammates' heads as a springboard. What does this mean as a layperson who sort of plays the game sometimes? More than you might think!

It's a singleplayer game in which you control not one but both carriers of a stretcher. You have to ferry a sick man over the hilly countryside, past muddy lake banks and over snowy mountains, all without dropping him on the ground. I can only imagine it controls a bit like Brothers: A Tale Of Two Sons, but with added ragdoll jollity. We'll know next week, when it releases on Steam.

I didn't expect to see any rival catfish appearing in games after that, but now that I think about it - why not? They're a naturally freaky animal, perfect video game antagonists. And the developers of upcoming Japanese folklore 'em up Otoshi No Shima seem to understand this, having created a monstrous creature with a gaping mouth that follows the player at every turn. Come see.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Readers, something actually magical has happened! I’ve spent a non-zero amount of time this week compiling a wishlist for potential Stardew Valley-likes that also let me keep pets. I wasn’t sure what I wanted to play, but I knew I was burnt out on both stabbing and shooting, and wanted something light and colourful with a solid loop that I could veg out (pun intended) with at the end of the day. I even went to so far as to create a chap named Karrot King in Stardew before quitting in disgust because I couldn’t easily access carrot seeds.
I cannot in good conscious claim that I manifested such a videogame - that was the work of Skyreach Studio. However, this is the internet, so I will both take credit for it and offer you an exclusive discount on my course. While I’m waiting for your membership fee to arrive, I’ll be playing Critter Crops. It’s a witchy farming sim in which you grow odd pets and cast spells from flesh-bound grimoires. One of the verbs it offers on its Steam page is 'noodle'. Apologies to all the other games on my wishlist.

      <p>MultiVersus has two new fighters on the way in the form of Jack from Cartoon Network/Adult Swim's beloved animated series <em>Samurai Jack</em> and Beetlejuice of, well, <em>Beetlejuice</em> and its upcoming sequel (don’t make me write it a third time). The game is also getting a ranked mode.</p>

<p>Samurai Jack and Beetlejuice are part of the Season 2: Back in Time content, which kicks off tomorrow, July 23. Jack becomes available at launch, letting players cut down oppo…]]></summary>

</p>


      <p>Perhaps the most unexpected announcement at EVO 2024 was the reveal that 2003’s SNK vs. Capcom: SVC Chaos is being re-released. Not only does this make it available on modern platforms with new bells and whistles, but you can play it right now.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The game was originally launched in 2003 for the Neo Geo arcade before it was ported to PlayStation 2 (in Japan) and Xbox in the U.S. It pits 36 fighters from SNK franchises such as The King of Fighters, Samurai Shodown, and Metal Slug 2 against Capcom fighters from series like Street Fighter, Mega Man, Darkstalkers, and more.</p>

<p>SVC Chaos now features quality-of-life updates such as a hitbox viewer, rollback netcode for online play, and an art gallery. It also makes formerly secret characters Athena and Red Arremer available from the start. The game's surprise launch on Steam on July 20 followed its reveal, and it comes to PlayStation 4 and Switch today. You can pick it up now for $19.99.</p>]]></summary>

      <p>On an almost weekly basis, Fortnite announces new crossover events, adding characters to its Battle Royale, Lego, and Festival modes. Whether it's a fictional character like Jack Sparrow or a real person like Ariana Grande, it's hard to find a corner of pop culture the game hasn't touched. These crossovers, however, are almost always exclusive to characters, but Fortnite players don't always have to traverse the Battle Royale map on foot – there are vehicles as well. Today's crossover comes in the form of a particul…]]></summary>

</p>


      <p>Tekken 8’s next Season 1 fighter was revealed during Evo this weekend, and it’s none other than Heihachi Mishima. The mainstay villain has apparently survived his presumed death (again) and is ready to reclaim his throne.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A cinematic trailer rolls out the red carpet for Heihachi, setting up his return after he was seemingly killed (i.e., tossed into a volcanic lava river) in Tekken 7. The video doesn’t explain how Heihachi managed not to melt into goop, but he does sport a Kazuya-esque scar on his chest now, so he didn’t walk away completely unscathed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Heihachi becomes available sometime this fall. He follows<a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/01/15/eddy-gordo-is-tekken-8s-first-dlc-fighter-opening-cinematic-released"> Eddy Gordo</a> and <a href="http://sobieska">Lidia Sobieska</a>, who joined Tekken 8 in the spring (i.e., July 25) and summer, respectively, leaving one fighter left for the winter season. Owners of Tekken 8’s Deluxe, Ultimate, or Collector's Editions automatically receive these fighters, and each can also be purchased individually for $7.99.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Arranger is a puzzle game about moving, in both metaphorical and literal senses. Movement is the entire basis for the puzzles in Arranger, and is hard to explain without showing you (if you're able to watch the trailer that will be helpful). The world of Arranger is divided into a grid, and you don't move the main character, feisty misfit kid Jemma, across the squares. Rather, imagine that the row or column Jemma is on becomes a travelator, and you control the direction and speed of it. Jemma stands still and you move the ground, and anything on it left, right, up or down - like How To Say Goodbye but with more squares. It's one of those things that makes sense when you're doing it, trust me.

He was last seen with his loving son Kazuya, who threw him into a volcano. Of course, to be fully submerged in impossibly hot liquid rock is merely a long-running family prank for the cast of this 3D fighting game, sort of like forcing your granddad to do the ice bucket challenge, but with lava. Nobody truly expected the horn-haired headbutter to be fully removed from the series. But I am a little surprised to see him back so soon.

FlatOut, then. A series of bumper car racing which managed to impress with its crumple zones long before the era of Wreckfest or BeamNG.

Now FlatOut, FlatOut 2 and FlatOut: Ultimate Carnage have all received an update on Steam to add Workshop support, Steam Deck verified status, improved performance, and in the case of FlatOut 2, re-enabled online multiplayer.

      <p>As part of <em>Game Informer's&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/DragonAgeTheVeilguard">exclusive cover story,</a> we flew to BioWare to discuss the making of Dragon Age: The Veilguard with three of the project's leads: Corinne Busche, John Epler, and Mark Darrah. The trio dives into their experiences designing this long-awaited RPG, including its similarities and departures from the series' previous titles like Dragon Age: Origins and 2014's Dragon Age: Inquisition.&nbsp;</p>

</p>


      <p>AI Limit is an upcoming action RPG that takes clear inspiration from From Software's Dark Souls and other games of the style. Set in a post-apocalyptic world where a mysterious substance has transformed the remainder of humanity into monsters, you control a powerful lifeform called a Blader exploring mankind's last city to put an end to the devastation. Join editors Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard as they show off what this intriguing action game has in store.&nbsp;</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ho, wayfarer! Beware slight spoilers for Alan Wake 2 in the passages ahead.

Deep in the Dark Place of Alan Wake 2 there is a forest that is not a forest - a zig-zag tunnel adorned with murals of a grisly woodland scene. Entering that tunnel, you find yourself sealed in at either end. But the mural suggests a way out: it changes when you turn around, following an unspoken narrative. It's a device as delicate as the graffiti elsewhere in the Dark Place is obnoxious. In hindsight, it feels like an example of "metsänpeitto", a concept from Finnish folklore about forests which, as writer Sinikka Annala explains, saturates the design of Alan Wake 2. It's a fascinating idea I'd love certain much larger, less intriguing video game worlds to learn from.

For instance, it's thanks to her that I know and am excited about Roots of Yggdrasil, a roguelike deck-and-city-builder which casts you as a posse of vikings in a flying longship, touching down on floating islands to found a quick settlement and harvest some magic before the apocalypse - here known as the Ginnungagap, a swirling purple void - catches up with them.
Katharine called it "a real grower" before the early access release in January, likening it to both Dorfromantik and The Banished Vault - a chalk and cheese comparison if ever I heard one. Well rejoice, perverted chalk-and-cheese mixers, because Roots of Yggdrasil now has a 1.0 release date - 6th September 2024.

Following the Steam and PC Game Pass releases yesterday, there are widespread reports of heavy stuttering spoiling the fun; I’ve given both versions a test, and indeed, Flintlock does have a serious case of the framerate stammers. Especially the Game Pass build, which is significantly worse for it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am burning the Bishop while he sleeps. I'd say it's nothing personal, but quite a lot in medieval management sim Norland is personal. He shouldn't have slept with the Queen's sister, for example. He shouldn't have insisted his lover subsequently pay him for a confession to absolve herself of the guilt accrued from sleeping with him. He shouldn't have felt safe in a room next to the Queen, a woman described as "reckless" in her character traits, and who is perilously close to having a nervous breakdown. This, my holy friend, is how your bed chamber becomes a raging inferno. 
By the end of my first game of Norland, the village of Nandos (you can name your own settlements) is covered in more blood than the back end of the bard's best work. In storytelling terms, it is a tragedy. In terms of fantasy management games? It is great fun. The failure cascade as waterslide.

The mechanics and overall presentation may be exquisite, but it’s the thrill of discovering another mutant jester modifier that has me lunging for the Steam Deck in my sleep. Well, now those jokers have competition: ducks. Step or rather waddle forward Placid Plastic Deck - A Quiet Quest, a quacked-up card battler which somehow takes inspiration from both the Pokémon series and Inscryption.

Instead, you use your supernatural time-bending abilities to tactically dispatch goons in a roguelike bash through increasingly difficult levels. It looks like a mixture of things: Sifu, Katana Zero, Aesthetically Cool Stuff In General.

I did not know  how utterly burnt out I was on violence and misery until I held one of pet simulation Bobo Bay’s sentient blob critters in my arms and lavished snacks upon it. When I close my eyes, I can still hear Conscript’s shells falling in the distance. But here and now, there are only Bobos, the races they take part in, and the idyllic bay in which they reside.

It’s something I always appreciate in films (Brendy mentioned Fleabag, I brought up Shane Meadows), and although the flow of many of Exodus’ scenes were quite awkward, it was still refreshing to see a game break away from the common, unnatural back-and-forth line delivery. Bioshock and Judas’s Ken Levine has a name for this - “turn-based dialogue.” According to Levine, it’s “one of the biggest problems” in the way games portray conversations.

Vultures is different to the others, though, in that it's turn-based zombie crunching combined with roguelike scavenging to survive and get more powerful.
