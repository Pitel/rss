To celebrate his achievements, EA Sports has released a special card which can be obtained in Ultimate Team.

The greatest weakness of this card is the lack of a role at Advanced Forward. However, it's a great choice for those who love playing a Target Man up front. The card has Target Man++, and First Touch+. It also offers Power Shot and Press Proven playstyle, which are extremely useful. I just wish that the SBC didn't require three TOTW items, which unnecessarily drive up the completion cost of this challenge.

He wanders around a crappy motel, stuck in the same old patterns of life, seemingly unable to escape his inner demons. When confronted with the premise for this upcoming RPG you may have one of two reactions. The first: you will say "lol, it me" with enough humour to wishlist it on Steam and earmark it for the future. The second: you will mutter "ugh, it me" and be immediately put off by the idea of having to tolerate an entire second layer of psychological hangups. 
There is a third secret reaction though... you might think: oh, this looks a lot like Disco Elysium, but in the real world.

Where to water the first of the plants in Life is Strange: Double Exposure


During the second chapter of Life is Strange: Double Exposure in the scene "By The Horns," you can water Gwen's plant in her office. Press the right shoulder button on your controller or the spacebar on your keyboard to skip through the lengthy cutscenes if you've finished this portion of the game. Gwen's office is located in the Fines Arts Building (FAB). After she gets kicked out by the security guard, sneak inside her office. Go into the Dead reality. 


Screenshot by Destructoid


In the right-hand corner of the room, you'll see a shriveled-up plant by the fish tank. It's under the flyer and her posters of Remember and The Flaming Mermaids. You're given an option to water the plant. 


Where to water Max's plant


Also in the second chapter Penumbra, you'll have a chance to water Max's plant in her house. Head to the Photo Finished scene at the end of the chapter. Don't get distracted by the cat or the evidence. Instead, go to the Massive Plant in the left-hand corner of the room, next to the windows and poetry books.

Select "Water" to finish the task and get the Thirst Trip trophy or achievement. You're one step closer to the platinum! You can finish other tasks like solving the Abraxas puzzle box and reading all the Platypus messages.

Publisher Thunderful has confirmed that it is launching another restructuring program aimed at reducing its workforce by up to 100 employees.
As reported by GamesIndustry.biz, Thunderful is looking to “increase its focus on third-party publishing and reduce the production of internally developed projects”, therefore resulting in significant redundancies within the company’s own development teams. In addition, roles within administration and management will also be affected.

All Classes with Battle Rez in WoW


There are two main versions of WoW, and both differ in which classes have access to a battle res. Rather than list them together, allow me to separate the following lists for your own clarity.


Battle Res classes in World of Warcraft: Classic


In WoW Classic, the only class that can cast any sort of in-combat resurrections is the Druid, and it is quite limited in its nature. The Druid's battle res is called Rebirth and it comes with a very hefty 30-m…]]></summary>

Hall of the Novice was introduced way back in patch 3.2, and has been left relatively untouched since then with little being added.

As such, the best builds with this beast involve empowering that hip-fire gameplay further with the right loadout and attachments.


Unlocking the ASG-89 requires you to have been playing for a bit, requiring you to achieve a mid-progression rank of level 31. Once unlocked, it can be equipped at any time in the primary slot of your custom loadouts. 


What is the best build for the ASG-89 in Black Ops 6?


If you use the ASG-89 as it comes in stock, it may seem underwhelming to you, and I'd agree. This is one of the few weapons in Black Ops 6 that pretty much requires attachments to be made viable. This is largely due to its mediocre …]]></summary>

This time, you'll substitute the small blade and green hood (ringing any bells?) of the first game's hero for the staff of a priestess of the Order of the Flame. With your magic powers in tow, you'll have to journey through 100 new dungeon-crawling levels, polishing off little Zelda-esque puzzles along the way.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The gaming keyboard market is currently tripping over itself, trying to equip everything with the technology most commonly known as Snap Tap: a feature that promises hyperfast inputs of two alternating keypresses, making you an unkillable side-strafing blur in your FPS of choice. Introduced on Razer’s Huntsman V3 Pro series and quickly followed by Wooting’s (functionally distinct but effectively identical) Rappy Snappy, Snap Tap is now wearing multiple names as it takes over the world of RGB peripherals, from SteelSeries’ Rapid Tap to Corsair’s FlashTap and Keychron’s... Last Keystroke Prioritisation. Which doesn’t sound as sexy, but still.

Because it enables a form of input automation – where you can quickly move in two directions by rapidly tapping one key, while holding down another – it’s considered by some as tantamount to cheating, allowing players to cross the line that divides unfair play from the accepted comforts that come with simply using a responsive Hall Effect keyboard or high-refresh-rate monitor. It’s even become a bannable offence in certain games, most notably in Counter-Strike 2.
Neither side is backing down; in an astonishingly worded tweet, Wooting went as far as to concede Snap Tap "should be considered cheating. But if it’s allowed, you need it." But do you?

Developer Tezcatek worked closely with Lugosi's granddaughter Lynne Lugosi Sparks and Lugosi Enterprises to include the legendary actor in the game.

While he doesn't outright confirm a Sonic the Hedgehog 4, Sonic 3 will offer some kind of hint as to where the series can go.

If you think back to the Pandæmonium raids, specifically the 11th Circle, you’ll remember Themis, which is the true name of Elidibus.

The entire Metro saga is on sale to celebrate the release of Metro Awakening, which launched for VR devices on November 7. But if you're not really a VR player and still fancy a tour through an apocalyptic wasteland, now's a good time to consider grabbing the games that came before it — if you don't already own them. Personally, playing VR games makes me feel a bit queasy after a while. I'm fine fighting mutant bats as my air supply slowly dwindles, but I'm happier doing it without the added nausea.

Reviews for the HD-2D remake of the NES's Dragon Warrior III have dropped today, and they're very positive across the board. It manages to recreate the feel of the original game while adding some beautiful visuals, music, and a handful of quality-of-life features to the experience.

One of these items was foretold in the preliminary patch notes and can turn even the clumsiest of players into a cocktail genius. 


The Shake Drink emote is a perpetual emote, meaning that it doesn’t end until you move or do something to interrupt it. It’s not just visual, either, as long as the emote is being performed, a shaking sound will accompany the movement. 


This is a particularly exciting emote for those who dip into the FFXIV Roleplay community, particularly those who partake in the nightlife scene. It adds a new level of realism to the bars and clubs frequented by players and it is a welcome surprise for this patch.

The brief 44-second teaser showed a character walking into his home, with the walls adorned with the head of Onyxia, a Mechanical Shredder statue, and other various items from the popular MMORPG before taking a drink from a mug with the words "Home sweet Home" on it. The teaser ends by showing the World of Warcraft: Midnight logo, hinting that the feature will be part of the upcoming Midnight expansion.




It's a feature that players have wanted since the start of the MMORPG's life back in 2004. Without many details, it's hard to know what exactly we're going to be getting with this, but as long as it's heavily customizable, we can show off some of our best achievements with it, and we can invite our friends, I think that would be a good start. Just no Garrison 2.0, please.

To combat this, the developers dropped in a new quest that can be undertaken for players to get their hands on yet another free Phial of Fantasia. Unlike the previous quest, which was added during the 7.0 update when Dawntrail was released, this second quest is only available for a limited time and will cease to exist once patch 7.2 is released. 


If you’ve been wandering around Eorzea for hours on end looking for this second free Fantasia, which is definitely worth it considering the usual cost of $10 per Phial, then you might be surprised to know where it actually comes f…]]></summary>

During today's Warcraft Direct, Blizzard announced that World of Warcraft will once again be returning to its Vanilla roots with the launch of World of Warcraft Classic 20th Anniversary Edition. Those interested in once again reliving the glory days can look forward to doing so when the servers launch globally next week on November 21.




Despite how much I enjoy the retail version of World of Warcraft, there's just something about WoW Classic. I'm sure a lot of it is the nostalgia; the reverberating memories of a simpler time is admittedly part of the appeal to me.

The plan was revealed after Shift Up, the South Korean developer behind Stellar Blade, answered a question about a potential PC port. Not only does the team expect to release the game on PC next year, but it believes Stellar Blade will excel by being on storefronts such as Steam. Shift Up acknowledged Wukong, which was released on PlayStation 5 and PC to, well, stellar results. The game peaked at 2.4 million players on Steam, eclipsing long-time titans such as Counter-Strike 2, Dota 2, and (uh) Banana.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Machine obsolete.
In a situation that echoes the reveal and subsequent Switch launch of Ori and the Blind Forest from Microsoft, we admit to feeling a tad shocked at the revelation that Sony’s LEGO Horizon Adventures would not just be released on PS5 and Windows, but also Nintendo’s humble hybrid. Sure, this isn’t the full-fat Horizon experience – PlayStation and PC owners keep that to themselves for the time being – but it’s comfortably the closest we’ve come to Sony migrating its first-party lineup over to another major console platform.
The result is a mixed bag. Lego Horizon Adventures starts as an incredibly fun, visually arresting dive into Guerrilla Games' flagship franchise; one that benefits from a more playful tone compared to the series proper, with faithful elements that will please fans of Aloy and Lego alike. But it’s also quite a shallow, repetitive game that leans heavily on a rather basic structure, with dull level design and severely limited stealth elements putting a dampener on the experience.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ever since 2v2 was introduced in Clash Royale, players have constantly been in demand for the 2v2 ranked mode. Now, after a long wait, the developers have introduced a dedicated v2 league in the game, but issues led to its temporary deactivation. 


This article will tell you everything you need to know about why the 2v2 League in Clash Royale was temporarily deactivated.


All possible reasons for 2v2 League temporarily deactivation in Clash Royale


Game crash


The biggest reason for the deactivation of the 2v2 League for a short period of time is due to the game crashes that are occurring when you invite your friends to play together. The fact that players can’t invite their friends for 2v2 matches has caused a lot of frustration in the community. People are really upset about it and are hoping the developers will fix the issue soon.


Zero gold


When you win a match in the 2v2 League, you don’t earn any gold, which is one of the main reasons the developers decided to temporarily disable the mode.


But here’s something you need to know: it is just a visual error, and you receive the desired amount of gold you get by winning the match. It is expected that the developer will provide the fix very soon.


No season tokens


Basically, when you win three matches in 2v2 League, you are supposed to get 800 season tokens, which is unfortunately replaced by Wooden Chests in the chest cycle. So, if you have claimed the Wooden Chests already, it is expected that the developers will provide you with a way to get the season tokens.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm pretty sure everyone had this on their Bingo Card for Warcraft Direct, but in case you didn't: surprise! As World of Warcraft: Cataclysm Classic nears its end, Blizzard has officially announced the Classic servers will continue progressing forward onto World of Warcraft: Mists of Pandaria Classic. No exact release date was given, but the switch from Cataclysm Classic to Mists of Pandaria Classic will happen in 2025.




Although this natural progression into Mists of Pandaria Classic was expected, I still can't help to be excited. I didn't play much of Cataclysm Classic because if I'm being quite honest, I'm not too fond of the expansion. Mists of Pandaria however is responsible to some of my favorite memories in World of Warcraft outside of Vanilla and maybe Wrath of the Lich King.


The expansion ups the level cap to 90 and adds the new Pandaren race and Monk class. The Pandaren are rather unique as the player can choose to join either the Horde or the Alliance at the end of the starter zone questline for the race. Mists of Pandariaalso added Challenge Modes for dungeons as well as the Pet Battle system.


World of Warcraft: Mists of Pandaria Classic will begin in 2025.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Centurions: TOTW Play objective is now live in EA FC 25, and it's a great way to get some amazing packs to improve your Ultimate Team squad.


The latest objective is pretty simple in terms of the tasks and their conditions. You can complete them easily by playing the game and get fodder packs in return. The key is to get the group rewards, as it's the most valuable pack among all the available ones. Let's take a look at how you can easily complete the challenge. 


EA FC 25 Centurions: TOTW Play objective guide


The latest objective set has five different tasks. 


Task
How to complete





TOTW Takedown
Defeat the featured Team of the Week Squad Battles squad.
78+ x2 Rare Gold Players Pack


TOTW Goal Streak
Score 20 goals using TOTW players in any Ultimate Team game mode.
78+ x3 Rare Gold Players Pack


Assist of the Week
Assist 20 goals using TOTW players in any Ultimate Team game mode.
78+ x5 Rare Gold Players Pack


TOTW Tag Team
Play 15 matches while having at least 2 TOTW players in your starting squad.
80+ x3 Rare Gold Players Pack


TOTW Victory Tour
Win 12 matches while having at least 2 TOTW players in your starting squad.
81+ x3 Rare Gold Players Pack






The biggest advantage of this objective set is the fact that you can complete it across any game mode. Hence, it's not necessary to play the Rivals game mode to complete the tasks. Instead, friendlies and Squad Battles will also count towards completion. 


Once you've completed the full set, you'll unlock a 84+ x2 Rare Gold Players pack for your efforts. It's pretty decent, and you could end up with a promo/walkout item with some luck. Hence, make sure to complete the set till it expires after two weeks from writing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blizzard revealed today that Warcraft 3 Reforged, the updated and remastered version of the classic RTS, is getting a big 2.0 update addressing some of the problems players have had with the Reforged version since launch. Alongside further visual updates to textures, lighting, and effects, Warcraft 3 Reforged 2.0 also comes with a much-needed revamped ranked ladder system and in-game hot key customization. Warcraft 3 Reforged 2.0 is live now and available to those who already purchased Reforged.




The highly anticipated Warcraft 3 Reforged launched back in January 2020 but immediately had a rocky start with washed unit graphics that blended in with the background, major performance issues including frequent crashes, barely any actual upgrades or changes, and features that were promised in the Reforged edition missing entirely. Blizzard began issue refunds to those who requested one, and Warcraft 3 Reforged went pretty silent.


The upgrades with 2.0 are definitely a step in the right direction, and a deserved one. Warcraft 3 is still one of the best RTS of all time, so seeing it get some extra love and care is a good thing.


The Warcraft Battlechest includes Warcraft 1: Remastered, Warcraft 2: Remastered, Warcraft 3: Reforged 2.0, and the original versions of Warcraft: Orcs and Humans and Warcraft 2: Tides of Darkness. It also includes some cosmetic DLC across many Blizzard games including Warcraft 3: Reforged multiplayer hero skins and a World of Warcraft Meat Wagon mount. It will run you $39.99 and is out now on Battle.net.

The Brachiosaurus is a dinosaur that roamed the Earth during the late Jurassic period, roughly 150 million years ago.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Centurions 100 Upgrade SBC is now live in EA FC 25, and it's a unique challenge in every way. 


For starters, you'll get a total of 100 different items by completing the challenge, but there's no guarantee of a promo item or a walkout. You'll have to submit three squads to complete the SBC, so it requires a fair amount of fodder. Let's look at how you can complete the challenge to unlock the rewards. 


EA FC 25 Centurions 100 Upgrade SBC tasks


The Centurions 100 Upgrade SBC has three different tasks, and here are their conditions. 


Task 1 - 82-rated squad



Min. Team Rating: 82



Task 2 - 82-rated squad



Min. 1 Players: Team of the Week


Min. Team Rating: 82



Task 3 - 83-rated squad



Min. 1 Players: Team of the Week


Min. Team Rating: 83



EA FC 25 Centurions 100 Upgrade SBC solutions


Here's a set of solutions you can use to complete the SBC for cheap. 


Task 1 - 82-rated squad



Any 10 82-rated items


Any 1 81-rated item



Task 2 - 82-rated squad



Any 10 82-rated items


Any 1 81-rated TOTW



Task 3 - 83-rated squad



Any 10 83-rated items


Any 1 82-rated TOTW



After completing the challenge, you'll get a 100 Mixed Players Pack. This is a unique pack, and it contains a total of 100 player items. The player items will be divided into 20 Rare Gold, 25 Common Gold, 30 Silver, and 25 Bronze. One of the cards is guaranteed to be rated 84 or higher. 


While the SBC suddenly looks interesting, only try it if you have enough disposable TOTW items. They are extremely important, and they're required in almost every good SBC. Hence, it might have some merit to hold on to them for the future SBCs to come in Ultimate Team.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[2004 sequel introduced multiplayer.
Metroid Prime 2: Echoes is celebrating its 20th anniversary this week after an initial Gamecube launch on 15th November 2004. In a new interview with developers Jack Mathews and Zoid Kirsch from Kiwi Talkz, it's been revealed that the game's multiplayer mode nearly featured playable Space Pirates.
The Space Pirates are an iconic, recurring enemy type within the Metroid franchise, and their similar stature to Samus would no doubt lend itself well to the first-person gameplay in the Prime trilogy, but alas, it wasn't to be. Like many things in the tricky world of game development, playable Space Pirates simply fell by the wayside and weren't implemented into the final game.

In one sense, they've turned from a game preservation champion into a slightly dustier, DRM-less Steam. Now, though, GOG have declared a renewed focus on not just selling aged games, but on tweaking more of them to work on non-aged hardware. And you'll be able to tell which games have got this restoration treatment from a fancy badge plastered on top of them.

It feels like it has been a long old time since we heard about Misc. A Tiny Tale. We've been keeping an eye on this delightful-looking 3D platformer since it was initially slated for a 2022 Switch release, and now, thanks to an adorable new trailer (via IGN), it looks like 2025 will finally be the year we get our hands on it.
For those who missed the initial announcement (or if you haven't checked out the above trailer yet), Misc. is a classic 3D platformer that will see you playing as an adorable tiny robot, embarking on a collectathon journey through a giant garden world. It looks like developer Tinyware Games has been inspired by the genre's biggest hitters like Super Mario 64 and Banjo-Kazooie, but there's more than a little Chibi-Robo thrown in there too — just look at that cute little fella!

Planet Coaster 2 wants to do that again, but this time adds water parks into the mix, with slides to design, pools to plop down, and raft rides that you can click together to form ambitiously speedy spirals. You can feel some creative pride when you look down on the watery wonderland you've made with these tools. But you may also wonder if it was worth the effort. As a newcomer to Planet management games, I've found this slippy sequel fiddly, cumbersome, and poorly explained.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The wait is finally over.
A few years ago, Square Enix announced it would be doing a remake of Dragon Quest III in its popular HD-2D engine, but this was then followed by a lengthy period of radio silence where its development status seemed uncertain. While they were at it, the developers decided to go ahead and remake the first and second Dragon Quests, too. Now that Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake is finally here, we’re happy to report that the wait has been well worth it. Though it isn’t without drawbacks, this is easily the most feature-rich and enjoyable version of Dragon Quest III available.
Released in Japan in 1988, Dragon Quest III hails from a much simpler era, so the narrative is considerably less detailed than one you may find in a title from subsequent decades. You begin as a nameless warrior, the child of a once-legendary hero, now called upon to take up your father’s mantle and save the world from the threat of an evil dark lord. There’s not much character development to speak of, nor narrative depth—your character is essentially a blank slate and your party members are basically animated cardboard cutouts with some stats and gear attached. Though there are ultimately some clever tie-ins to other releases in the series and some new cutscenes to flesh out your father’s role, the plot amounts to little more than 'there’s a bad dude out there; go get him!'

He’s got ill designs on the world. Your Dad tried to stop him, and he died. He fell into a volcano. We absolutely can’t be having that.
This is, more than anything else, a game about Going On An Adventure. Well walked ground, of course, but it’s rare to see it embarked upon with such barefaced delight, or such a wholehearted commitment to going the distance. It is a very big and a very simple RPG that is as wide as an ocean and as deep as a pond; a game to curl up with and play lazily and—with some sour caveats—enjoyably, for an entire winter.

Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund has reduced its stake in Nintendo for the second time in as many months.
As reported by Bloomberg (thanks, The Edge), a new filing in Japan shows that the PIF's stake in the Japanese video game firm now stands at 6.3%, down from 7.54%. This follows an earlier 1.04% reduction in October, a move which came soon after reports to the contrary suggesting the sovereign wealth fund was seeking to increase rather than decrease its Nintendo stakehold.

Back in July, Nintendo dished out a handful of lawsuits in its continued clampdown on Switch piracy. Four months on, one of these legal claims has come back as another win for Nintendo after the defendant failed to plead or otherwise respond within the court's given time.

It’s deeply imperfect and willfully obtuse, but also absolutely fascinating. I’ll ground you with a slightly wonky and dull allusion to Cultist Simulator, then guide you through in more or less the order I experienced it. As we progress, you may feel steadily more disorientated. It’ll be like a brewery tour I’ve somehow inherited control of by murder-boning the previous owners. Onward!

In a social media post, the company's customer service branch has warned users to be mindful of where they leave their Switch consoles and accessories when in the presence of any pets. It states that pet saliva and urine can cause systems to malfunction due to excess water exposure. Duh.

A more accurate jab, in hindsight, might have been "you been running S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl at full specs or something?", because based on the upcoming FPS’s new system requirements, you’re going to need a reasonably laissez-faire attitude to literally any other concern in your life that doesn’t involve acquiring a notably juice-guzzling rig.

In fact, it was originally developed by Cavalier Game Studios. Tequila Works are the publishers of the game and are also listed as "co-developers" on Steam. Very sorry for the mistake!
Original article: The studio behind sunny third-person adventure Rime has filed for insolvency, with the heads of the studio quitting their roles. Tequila Works had their funding from Tencent pulled at some point, according to Eurogamer Spain, leaving the company without an important flow of cash. Which may explain why they cancelled a game last month and laid off some of their workers. It now looks like that was just the first sign of a more serious problem which has sadly resulted in the dissolution of the studio.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Slitterhead offers something unique. It’s an indie horror game focusing on body horror and possession but with far more action-combat than most horror titles, making it easily accessible and approachable for those who don’t often lean into the genre. It’s not altogether terrifying, thanks to the ability to…

"I didn’t even know what a Neo-Volkite pistol was until five minutes ago, but now this whole game is trash until I get one!." As promised in the roadmap, the last big update added a whole new Operations map, complete with a gargantuan new pseudo-boss in the form of a hierophant bio-titan. It did not, however, give me my beloved pistol. It’s fine. It’s in now, along with a few, less Neo-Volkite updates to other weapons.

Not alongside the upcoming RTX 50 series, as rumoured, but right-now-today-this-minute. I’ve been testing out the launch version and while it’s not without some dud features, it does agreeably achieve its stated goal of combining the functions within Nvidia Control Panel and GeForce Experience. And if installing it means never having to use the latter again, well, that’s 149MB well spent.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My strongest and most enduring memory of Grand Theft Auto will always be creasing into complete hysterics watching my mate pile into a crumpled police officer with a wooden baseball bat in GTA 3 after school one time. Young’uns these days just don’t appreciate how revolutionary it was to be able to hit a cop with a thing after he’d already fallen over. Suffice it to say I’ve got good memories of the open world series’ nascent forays into 3D, though never enough to tempt me into revisiting them, especially given the poor reception to Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition. I can sympathise. I’m annoyed just having to type a colon and a dash in the same game name.
If you’re in a similarly non-fussed position (I will never not be annoyed that ‘nonplussed’ doesn’t mean what it sounds like it should mean) I can’t imagine a lighting update that’s been available on the mobile versions for a while is enough to tempt you back. But what is a reporter's job if not pathetically treading water between chunklets of Grand Theft Auto news, upon the publishing of which Graham presses the button to release the nutritious pellets on which we all wholly subsist? I hope he doesn’t read that last sentence. I don’t get my pellet if the syntax becomes too convoluted. Moving swiftly on.

Despite teaching you everything you need to know in the tutorial, it still manages to introduce new wrinkles and twists on the formula with each fresh chapter. My verdict? Imagine me lying my floor, massaging my temple with one hand and giving a fat thumbs up with the other.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Castle Master, the haunting conclusion to the Freescape engine saga, is now ready for public testing!
Prepare yourself for a perilous adventure as you lower the drawbridge to enter the Castle Master’s domain. Released in 1990 by Incentive Software, Castle Master became popular for its technical innovation and challenging gameplay. The game inspired countless 3D adventure titles, and the Freescape engine itself marked a technological milestone, enabling groundbreaking object interaction and spatial puzzles.
Notably, Castle Master was one of the first games to let you choose to play as either a prince or a princess, offering a different experience depending on your choice.
Your mission: rescue your twin, imprisoned within the eerie depths of Castle Eternity by the evil Magister. This sprawling, foreboding castle is filled with traps, monsters, and puzzles blocking your path. Gather items, unlock doors, and solve complex riddles as you navigate the labyrinthine halls and confront the dark forces within.
This modern reimplementation showcases enhanced graphics using OpenGL, with initial support for the DOS and ZX Spectrum releases. If you’re eager to embark on this dark journey, a playable demo is available to test your tenacity.
To participate in the testing, ensure you have a daily development build. We encourage all players to submit feedback and bug reports through our issue tracker.
Will you brave the creepy corridors of Castle Eternity and free your sibling, or will you fall victim to the Magister’s curse and join his army of enslaved spirits? The adventure awaits!

Still, it's an ever-evolving thing and Activision have announced the game's first seasonal drop. It's a hefty one with a lot of additions, so I'll try my best to break down the good stuff. TLDR: there's some new maps for multiplayer and zombies, new modes, and a few extra bits. I'm mildly excited for more. More in this case is good.

The simplest answer is that’s it’s a recurring bit of levity, a holdover easter egg, elevated to the status of key mission item in Hitman: Codename 47 before being given pride of place as an explosive in the World Of Assassination games. But to ascribe such unassuming purpose to the duck is to ignore its revelatory power. We must go deeper.

It looks like they're focusing on the act of throwing capsular items to catch or release monsters, together with the usage of monsters as mounts.
If you've somehow yet to encounter Palworld, it's a bestselling survival game that takes hefty - some would say, scandalous - inspiration from Pokémon, with players poaching Pokésque critters using magic spheres, and deploying them as soldiers and minions.

There’s only one of the three characters available in the freebie (one of the others is a toad nun with a shotgun), but he’s got a little cutlass, a flintlock pistol, and a can-do attitude - at least when it comes to either stabbing or shooting things. The game itself is a little bit deckbuilder, a little bit Into The Breach: turn based strategy with perfect information and various tricks you can pull to make enemies hit each other instead of the thing you’re trying to protect. Indulge yourself on the gourmet tray-tray below.

I haven't really thought about it before, but Rift Riff's effusively laidback crowd control has me pondering those optimal moments in any tower defender when the incoming horde hits the flamer-MG triangle just right, and you can settle back comfortably into the role of clockwatcher.
Rift Riff encourages this behaviour by being nice to look at. Created by a trio of developers including Hidden Folks designer Adriaan de Jongh, it's a world of spacey, sun-carved mountains, forests and monoliths. The towers resemble the sacred architecture of Monument Valley, and the colour scheme and general ambience remind me of Cocoon. There's a demo, if you fancy it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nostalgia, when you think about it, is bollocks. There has never been a better time than right this second – averaged out, and despite repeated attempts to the contrary, humanity has never been healthier, freer, or more enlightened by knowledge. It’s true of games too. For every by-committee platter of passionless map markers, there are thousands of more personal, more creative, more interesting works, all adding to the decades' worth of great stuff we can still play today.
What isn’t bollocks is the emotional pull that nostalgia, for all its lack of cold, hard reason, still manages to wield inside our warm, squishy brains. Hence, the centrepiece of Apex Legends’ Season 23 update is a mode that recreates the battle royale FPS as it was back in 2019, defaulting back to the original map and weapon arsenal while cutting the 26-strong legend roster to the earliest ten. It’s a Fortnite-style rolling back of the clock, and a passably enjoyable one, but also a reminder that the good old days weren’t always that good.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I first played Taiko no Tatsujin in an arcade (in Japan, because I am very cool), where it's controlled by hitting a recreation of an actual taiko drum. It was fun enough that I wish there was a taiko drum peripheral available for PC now the series is on our platform. 

Taiko no Tatsujin: Rhythm Festival is out now via Steam, where it offers over 70 songs to drum through, and a subscription service through which to unlock over 700 more. Maybe I should try to get my Donkey Konga drums working on PC, but I'll probably settle for playing it with a gamepad.

"Why, that's a Mass Effect vessel. Some mistake here surely?" 1) My name's not Shirley, and 2) Indeed it is a Mass Effect ship, but HelloGames struck a time-limited deal with BioWare to create a version for their own space sim.
"Blast, if only I'd noticed this at the time and acquired one," you mourn. "Ah, so many years I have wasted." Be of good cheer, my friend, for No Man's Sky has a Normandy once again, just in time for the latest N7 Day of assorted Mass Effect celebrations. For the next two weeks, you'll be able to get a-hold of it by way of a revised version of 2021's Beachhead Expedition. Tray-tray, away!

Everything revolves around catching, selling, and collecting the fish that gather in the rivers of a small island. It also lets you customise your character with clothing. Mostly simple hats and shorts, but some options let players celebrate their sexuality, such as a rainbow-adorned t-shirts, or titles that hang above your character which simply say "Trans" or "Bi". All this led one player to complain there was no "Straight" title. So, the developer added one. It costs 10 grand.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few months ago, the rumour took root that GTA 6's release date would slip back from 2025 to 2026. An anonymous insider averred that studio heads were "worried" about the new open world game's progress - hence, perhaps, Rockstar's decision to mandate a full return to in-office work. Pshaw, say publishers Take-Two CEO. They announced a fall 2025 launch in March and have just doubled down on it in their latest financial briefing, with CEO Strauss Zelnick subsequently going on the tellybox to say that Take-Two are "highly confident in the timing", though he still has nothing to share about GTA 6 on PC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I was a competitive long-distance runner at school, breath control was paramount. We were never really taught this, mind. It was an art you picked up through practice: how to breathe before the race, saturating your blood with O2 without dizzying yourself; when to permit the shorter, emergency breaths and when to apply restraint; when to deepen your inhales and charge yourself up for an attack on a hill.
And then, how to organise your body around your breath, straightening your posture to expand your lungs without tipping back too far and squandering muscle power; how to breath in time with your stride and the movement of your shoulders, so as to firm up your momentum and shave a miraculous-feeling minute off your finishing time. All this, plus various daft psychological war gambits of my own devising. When overtaking or being overtaken, I used to seal my lips shut on that side and breath through the other corner of my mouth, to make it look like I was hardly out of breath at all.

It’s snacky and a bit janky, but it’s also great coffee break fodder, assuming you want to spend your break breaking a selection of heavy objects over the crumbly skulls of ne’er-do-wells.

Exploring rooms to the side, Alan Wake 2: The Lake House’s star finds whiteboards and documents revealing the typewriter’s purpose: to mimic Wake’s writing. Pages are graded along criteria such as ‘style’, ‘tone’, and ‘content’, then “fed into the algorithm” as references until “near-identical stories” to Wake’s can be produced.
“If Jules could simply cut the painter open and pull the painting out of him, he would,” reads one of the real Alan’s typewritten pages. That’s Jules Marmont, the obsessive head of the titular FBC centre. The Marmonts - Jules and his wife Diana - are running experiments to forcibly and synthetically create works of art, aiming to mimic creative passion convincingly enough for the paranatural entity inside Cauldron Lake to respond, as it has in the past.

Good news for stealth fans, and perhaps gooder news for a dozen strapline writers sweating profusely, soiling themselves in anticipation of using “kept you waiting, huh?”.
Until then, I at least have a steady drip feed of new information to keep me sated, the latest of which is the substantial hint that there'll be some new dialogue in the game, as per the video below. Alongside that, the previously pseudonymous Suzetta Miñet - who was credited with voicing EVA in MGS3 and Peace Walker - has revealed herself to be Jodi Benson, the voice of Ariel in Disney’s The Little Mermaid. Cheers for the spot, Automaton West.

Its developers have just announced a major new update coming next summer, Foxhole: Airborne, which adds planes to the game for the first time.

Planes, in a topdown MMO? It makes a little more sense if you watch the trailer.

We've been following its development for a while but it's out now on Steam, and seemingly as strong as its demo suggested.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After 15+ years of blackholing IP addresses and making the Domain Name System tell more lies than Pinocchio, some may wonder whether site-blocking is harming prospects of a future open internet. Confirmation that piracy blocking tests are now being conducted at the internet's core routers isn't a surprise. It's only the internet's spinal column, so what could possibly go wrong?

I always read the comments, for all commenters are my children. They exist to glorify and preserve me in my dotage. True, occasionally my children say things like "I think your writing and opinions are appalling, and that you deserve to be repeatedly run over by a herd of deer", but it is the nature of children to rebel.

Those new cats, dogs, and turtles had the cute distinction of being able to wear hats, should you choose to kit your wee friends out. Now, following many months of smaller updates to the game, it seems those hats are causing a problem. "[If] you are experiencing performance issues in Stardew Valley 1.6, remove all hats from pets," said creator Eric Barone in a xeet. When asked the lore-accurate cause of this problem, he blamed: "a strange rash".

It's basically another method of capturing funny ragdoll glitches and posting them on the "lol-games-are-dumb" channel of your friend's Discord. Or for posting that flukey knife throw in Call Of Duty to Twitter, as if you really meant to kill the man from across the map all along. Or saving a clip for your personal records, like the footage of that time you yeeted an innocent citizen off the 50-foot wall of a castle town in Dragon's Dogma 2. We all do that, right? Right?

There’s still no word on the exact title, although given the established naming convention (Shadows Of Change, Thrones Of Decay), I’m tentatively calling it “Sniffers Of Glue” in honour of the No Think, Only Krump faction selection.
You’ll find the vlog in its full glory below. What’s interesting about this one is that vlog mainstay director Rich Alridge has brought along some new faces: battle designer Josh King and audio director Chris Goldsmith. And, yes, so no-one can accuse me of burying the lede: that audio design involved the enthusiastic, deeply disgusting slurping of porridge and yoghurt, and the jangling of real bones. The source of the bones is not revealed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After seven months of intense work, we are ready to announce support for a few games based on qdEngine, developed by K-D Labs.
The work is based on the original sources published now under GPL, although the work started a bit earlier than that. The engine supports 14 games, five of which we are announcing support for. Most of these games were released in Russian; however, there were Lithuanian, Czech, and Polish releases. The support is announced for:
Wait for it! Issue 3. Song for a Hare, (Russian: Ну, погоди! Выпуск 3. Песня для зайца, Lithuanian: Na, palauk! Zuikio dainos, Czech: Jen počkej a Píseň pro zajíce)
Mask Show (Russian: Маски-шоу)
Marvellous Mice Adventures: Meeting Sea Rat (Russian: Три маленькие белые мышки. Визит Морской крысы, Czech: Příběhy myší rodinky I, Polish: Były Sobie Myszki Trzy: Na Spotkanie Cioci Myszy)
The Adventures of the Good Soldier Schweik (Russian: Похождения бравого солдата Швейка)
Marvellous Mice Adventures: Sea Rat's Birthday, (Russian: Три маленькие белые мышки. День рождения морской крысы, Polish: Były Sobie Myszki Trzy: Urodzinowe Śledztwo)
Other games do work; however, we haven’t playtested them. You may find more information on our Wiki. Also, we are looking for the Lithuanian version of Little Longnose and Polish releases of Little Mice games and Wait for it! game. If you happen to have a copy, please contact sev.
We continue the active development so that support for other games will follow shortly. The primary constraint is playtesting.
To run these games, you need the latest daily build of ScummVM. If you encounter any hiccups during your quests, please file them on our issue tracker.

According to the plaintiffs, the owner of the service "held himself out as a Chicago-area law enforcement officer" to "mitigate potential concerns" over the unlawfulness of his business. A theoretical damages claim of more than a billion dollars, plus an allegation of wiretapping, makes this case a little more spicy than most.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've spent quite a lot of today trying to figure out why, exactly, some of the monsters in the Monster Hunter Wilds beta looked like bundles of copulating pyramids slathered in crocodile gravy. Nic clued me in on this reddit thread earlier, which cites unnamed Chinese players who've allegedly data-mined the beta's monster models, and learned that they are extremely large, encompassing hundreds of thousands of polygons.
If every monster in Monster Hunter Wilds were that fancy all of the time, your computer would become a volcano. As such, the game resorts to loading-on-demand systems to ensure that you only see those gorgeous details when the monsters are close by and, as the case may be, angrily sitting on you. When they're further afield, the flourishes fall away to free up memory and processing power. The popular Redditor explanation for the presence of monsters that look like Henry Moore sculpture is basically that the LOD systems are being forgetful, and neglecting to load the additional polygons at proximity.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As a yearly blockbuster, Call of Duty, through sheer expense and effort, would like you to think it is the Die Hard of video games. Or, depending on the setting, the Saving Private Ryan of video games. But it is barely Black Hawk Down. This latest campaign in Call Of Duty: Black Ops 6 reminds me more of the forgettable Netflix shootfests that thumbnail their way across your TV screen as you try to find some gritty nothing to aid you in zoning out of life. Still, there is an anecdotal contingent of casual sofa sitters for whom Call Of Duty is the game. A balls-to-the-wall shooter to return to every winter and rinse through in a weekend. Ed has already gestured at its multiplayer, announcing: "yup, it's COD", like a deeply tired Captain Birdseye inspecting the day's catch, wondering when his life will change. But never mind that. How does the single player story mode hold up? Some are calling it the best campaign in years. And I guess that's true, in the sense that it is the least worst.

Dragon Age: The Veilguard runs like a tap on any halfway decent desktop hardware, so was naturally going to be worth trying on the weaker Deck. And sure enough, Bioware’s RPG (which is really more of an action game with the occasional verbal spar) settles comfortably into handheld life.
In fact, Valve have festooned its Steam page with a Verified medal, a seal of approval for any game that performs and controls well on the Steam Deck without any glaring weaknesses or impractical annoyances. It’s still worth playing around with the settings – more on those later – but I’ll back up that official assessment, having played for several hours without so much as an undersized tooltip.

It's an "innovative urban walking simulator" in which you play a disembodied pair of shoes, individually moved with a controller's analog sticks and trigger buttons. The first half of the trailer is all whimsy and playground fun - kicking a football, standing on a climbing frame, riding a skateboard. But then a note of darkness creeps in, as the player begins to channel the sheer nihilistic inconsequentiality of a world in which shoes have no thinking human bodies to restrain them.

It'd be more fitting to say it's somehow automated the whole process: an inserter plucked out the rulebook from my brain and deposited it in hot magma, while a new rulebook was churned out in a nearby machine and plopped into my brain from the other side - only for that to be immediately plucked out and incinerated as well. With each new planet and each new phase, Space Age reinvents itself. I'm battling hyperbole here, but ah hell, I admit defeat. Factorio: Space Age is a masterpiece, the final form of perhaps the most well-crafted building game I'll ever play.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have zero archaeology experience or knowledge, but I bet archaeologists really love their jobs (for the most part). They get to analyse and discover cool artefacts and educate us on the histories of forgotten civilisations. That's dreamy stuff, that is. But I do wonder what it's like for archaeologists to discover and study something they shouldn't have; something with a disturbing secret - a curse, maybe. Bite-sized horror game The Children Of Clay explores this idea and I'd like more of it, please.

Yes. I admit it: I am a bug hypocrite, loudly extolling their virtue and beauty at a distance then getting irritated if they decide to come sit on me.
Fortunately, real time strategy Empire Of The Ants understands that the best place for insects to be is inside a screen, where they can be appreciated but cannot under any circumstances touch you. It’s out this week, as it happens, and here’s a new launch trailer to celebrate. Follow your pheromone trail to the video below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Early reactions to Call Of Duty: Black Ops 6 multiplayer range from frothing dislike through omnimovement hype to our own Ed Thorn's dead-eyed appraisal that it's "a good one, I think. Not a bad one. If you like Call Of Duty, you will like this. If you don't like Call Of Duty, you will not like this." I feel like we need to emergency-deploy a supply crate of smelling salts, because the sheer OK-ness of Black Ops 6 appears to have tumbled Ed into a stupor. 


Perhaps it would be a different story if he'd encountered some of the spawning issues and glitches people are talking about, with players joining games and materialising right into a hail of fire. The players in question include Black Ops 6's developers, who comically note in the latest Black Ops 6 patch notes that "Yes, we saw ourselves in a Killcam before selecting a Loadout too." The latest patch seeks to address this, naturally. As regards the campaign side of things, it also resets your safehouse currency to 5000, if you've had your single player funds stolen (or multiplied) by technical gremlins.

For all the things I ended up enjoying about Dragon Age: The Veilguard, it isn’t much of an RPG. What little roleplaying it does offer revolves around what flavour of supportive hero you prefer, and you can count the number of impactful dialogue decisions on a three-fingered hand. This might sound utterly damning in the wake of Baldur's Gate 3’s incredible reactivity, and if I approached games as some sort of tedious comparative intellectual exercise rather than just, y’know, seeing how I felt about them, then I suppose it would be. Weirdly, though, the recent memory of Baldur’s Gate 3 didn’t diminish my time with Veilguard at all. It was actually the opposite: it freed Dragon Age from having to carry the torch for a certain period in Bioware’s history, and let me enjoy Veilguard for what it was.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Twitch have introduced a new "Politics and Sensitive Social Issues" label for streams that "focus" on topics like "elections, civic integrity, and war or military conflict". As with the streaming giant's existing labels for M-rated material, sexual themes or depictions of gambling, the idea is that viewers can filter out such streams in advance by altering their settings.
Advertisers, similarly, can "make better choices about the content they want to advertise next to" - in other words, pull their ads from a whole swathe of material if they don't want to be associated with anything controversial. Twitch's hope is that "the labels will allow advertisers to have more context to inform which types of streams they show their ads alongside, which we expect to increase brands’ confidence in running ads on Twitch, and could bring new advertisers to our service."

Not only would this be inaccurate, but it would also do a disservice to what Straftat truly is, namely a wild overcorrection in response to the direction of modern multiplayer gunfests, one that careens straight through retro stations to arrive somewhere new and exciting.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The mystery surrounding Deadlock, Valve’s work-in-progress MOBA shooter, has largely evaporated. Its freely extendable invite system is about as effective at controlling player headcount as a disinterested football steward, meaning pretty much anyone with a clued-in Steam friend can get in and start poking around its secrets. And yet, being a lane-pushing wizard fighter in the Dota 2 vein, it’s already a vast tangle of interplaying abilities, items, strats, and often unspoken rules, of the kind that even experienced gankists will take hundreds of hours to learn. It’s been too much for poor Brendy, at any rate.
Still, Brendy is but one man. What if we had but four men, working in tandem to crush lanes and flatten Patrons just as Gabe intended? To find out if Deadlock is indeed more comprehensible as a team sport, Graham, Ed, Ollie, and James joined forces, promptly getting fucked up yet emerging from the warlock hospital with a deeper understanding of its workings. Or, at least, if anyone would keep playing.

Bugs and maddening enemy spawns diminished the tension of being a fleshy human scavenger in a mech battlefield. But one feature annoyed some players much more - fresh water. See, you need to keep your headquarters stocked with water, as it gets steadily used by your settlement's inhabitants. The catch being that this water diminishes even while you're not playing the game. If it runs out completely, then everything you've collected gets wiped. The developers have listened to complaints about this most Farmville of mechanics, and they've answered in an interesting way. Water thieves! Now, on top of the usual downward trickle, burglars will come to steal your H2O as well.
It's not as bad as it sounds.

And within that first hour, Slitterhead's body-possessing and Hong Kong-inspired streets had me thinking, "Is this it, the sleeper hit of 2024?!"
No, sadly not. It's no doubt built a compelling universe filled with brain-sucking aliens that masquerade as humans, and it attempts plenty else besides: bouncing between bodies as you stealth around dingy apartment blocks, fighting with blood katanas, and gorging on pools of red plasma to refuel skills, many of which require more body-flitting. Thing is, they are ultimately just attempts, attempts that fall victim to an emptiness and jitteriness that quickly reveals Slitterhead's true, irritating form.

As such, I didn’t spend enough time with the combat to get a proper feel for it.

That's not the actual distant past you're parkouring through. That isn't actual Renaissance architecture you're clambering on. It's a holographic Animus simulation, conjured from ancestral memories flash-frozen within your DNA - convenient, inasmuch as it means that any inconsistencies are your DNA's fault, not Ubisoft's. If the ledge-mantling animations are glitchy, that's simply because you have bad genes.
We can both be forgiven for losing sight of Assassin's Creed's modern day narrative frame. Ubisoft themselves have downplayed it since the era of Desmond Miles, the watery Peter Parker figure who served as puppetmaster protagonist for AC games up to Assassin's Creed 3. In Assassin's Creed Shadows, however, they're planning to bring back the modern day setting in a big way, though details are scanty.

That means it falls to me to round up (mostly) good (mostly) writing about (mostly) video games. I will otherwise be spending my Sunday continuing the fight against my dog's fleas, which rebound every three weeks no matter how much I spray, scrub or throw things away.  
On, the independent video game magazine which I linked to last week, has run a series of brief interviews with each of the contributors to its launch issue.

I am keen on any game that aims to follow in its footsteps, and there are a few. The latest is Blood Typers, a horror game where you tippity-tap on your keyboard to fight montsters in a spooky mansion, but this isn't a rail shooter, so you'll be typing to explore and navigate, too.

It's now got a release of February 2025, and there's a demo you can play now.

And every single time my brain clunks into gear and I turn inwards, where I struggle to come up with anything meaningful to say. So much so that a fog develops and out of the fog emerges a figure - it's me. I'm holding an M4A1 with an extended barrel and a vertical foregrip.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are excited to announce that Rise of the Dragon  is now ready for public testing. This is the first of a small number of games built using the DGDS (Dynamix Game Development System) engine.
The Dynamix name may be familiar – bought by Sierra in 1990, the Dynamix brand continued and became well known for action and puzzle games like The Incredible Machine, A10 Tank Killer, and Red Baron.  They also made a few adventures using the custom DGDS engine.
Rise of the Dragon is set in Los Angeles in a dark version of the future, circa 2053.  You play as Blade Hunter, a private investigator and retired police officer.  After a designer drug kills the mayor's rebellious daughter, Chandra, Hunter is hired to find the people responsible for releasing the drug on the streets. What Blade ultimately finds is much more than he expected.  Rise of the Dragon combines classic point-and-click adventure style with platforming arcade sequences, giving a unique gameplay combination.
You’ll need the latest daily build of ScummVM and files from the DOS version of the game, which you can buy at GOG (check our wiki for the required data files).  Please file any issues you notice on our bug tracker.

We are proud to announce that Unrest is now playable using ScummVM thanks to the work done by our GSoC student, Kartik Agarwala! Help us test the game by grabbing a daily build of ScummVM. Read through our testing guidelines, and please take some screenshots along the way. If you encounter any issues, please report them to our bugtracker.
If you don’t own Unrest, you can purchase this game from either GOG or Steam. The demo for the game is also supported and available from our web site.
Now go, use your manipulative skills to bring peace to this troubled world where chaos is not afar. For the most daring players using the iron-man mode, saving and loading the game is only available using ScummVM's Global Main Menu.

To je jeho největší a soustavný problém, ale má i mnoho dalších, například arabské teroristy z "Návratu do budoucnosti" a pointu, spočívající v tom, že veřejnoprávní média vám non-stop lžou a vy jim to štastně žerete (což je pointa pravděpodobně nezamýšlená, protože film spoluprodukoval Český rozhlas). Je velmi smutné vidět dílo, na kterém pracovali lidi, o kterých víme, že jsou schopni vyprodukovat něco zajímavého, a výsledek dopadl takto strašlivě. (Ilča 10 %)]]></summary>
