The obvious choice at that point is to pick up The Witcher books by Andrzej Sapkowski. These were, after all, what introduced the world to Geralt and his unforgettable companions. You begin with The Last Wish and continue that journey with Sword of Destiny, two collections of short stories detailing Geralt’s earlier years as a feared monster hunter. 


Then it’s off to the main saga, consisting of five novels revolving around Ciri’s trials as the Lady of Space and Time. Only then do you realize you’re back at the beginning and have to play the CD P…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After allowing players to level up their weapons faster in XDefiant last weekend, Ubisoft decided to come back and gift everyone another double weapon XP period. 


Ubisoft confirmed that double weapon XP will be available starting Friday at 10 a.m. ET and ending Monday at 1 p.m. ET. This comes after players complained that XDefiant's weapon progression is 'criminally slow.' 


One XDefiant player claimed it takes over 100 hours to level up one weapon. XDefiant developer Patrick 'ACHES' Price clapped back and attempted to reassure fans by claiming that its 3500 XP per weapon level and one kill equals 100 XP. So, operating under that math, it is a maximum of 35 kills per level. 




For secondary weapons, that requirement is even less, with 1500 XP per weapon level. Each weapon has 50 levels, meaning it could take players a few hours to reach the max level on every weapon, but it all depends on their skill level. 


Skilled players should be able to get around 20-30 kills per round, but that's also no easy feat. It's unclear how much of a difference it makes with double XP active, but users should take advantage of it while they can. To get XP faster, Domination or Occupy. Both game modes are fast-paced and take place on the title's smaller-scaled maps.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero’s latest trailer has unveiled fusion warriors for its roster. It also seems to tease another announcement on the horizon.
The trailer reveals the additions of Gotenks (the fusion of Goten and Trunks), Kefla (the fusion of Caulifla and Kale), Fused Zamasu, and Goku and Vegeta’s fusions, Vegito and Gogeta. Watch them trade blows in the trailer below: 


Since each fusion includes the fighters that make them up and their various transformations, the full list of characters joining the roster amounts to 21. Check them out below.

The trailer ends with a message serving as a classic callback to the anime that states, “Next time on Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero: Summer Game Fest 2024.” Could we be getting a release date at Geoff Keighley’s showcase? Given that the game was revealed during another Keighley show, The Game Awards 2023, it wouldn’t be surprising.
Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero is the next entry in what’s known in the West as the Budokai Tenkaichi series (Sparking is the franchise's original Japanese name). The roster is only halfway revealed, but we’ve already seen a number of confirmed fighters from Dragon Ball Z and Dragon Ball Super, including multiple versions of the same characters. The game has no release window but is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. You can learn more about the game's new mechanics and features here.]]></summary>

Hellblade 2: All hidden faces and their locations


There are 17 hidden faces locations throughout Hellblade 2. Believe it or not, they appear as stone faces carved into walls. Crazy, right? Focusing on them causes them to 'disappear', opening a path to a small tree — akin to Yggdrasil, the Nordic world tree — beyond, along with a bit of narration. It's kind of a cool effect with the faces melting into the environment, but I digress. Let's look for some trees.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Final Shape is nearly upon Destiny 2 players, but that doesn't mean there aren't opportunities to shoehorn in collaborations with other properties. Wizards of the Coast and Sony/Bungie have now teamed up to bring Dungeons and Dragons to Destiny 2. Kindly put aside the finale you've been waiting a decade for, it's time to pony up some cash for medieval fantasy gear in a science fiction shooter.


Somehow, the Mindflayer Warlock makes too much sense




The announcement came via the official Destiny 2 account on X. Fans of both franchises will be able to indulge on June 4, 2024, when the collaboration goes live with the release of The Final Shape. From armor sets to an emblem and even a physical Eye Tyrant Ghost Shell, there's plenty here.

Flayer's Dominion Set (Warlock)


Spectral Displacer Set (Hunter)


Queen of Dragons Ship


Owlbear Chariot Sparrow

Bigby's Fist Finisher

This isn't the first time that Bungie has partnered with another property in a bizarre crossover. Earlier this year, we had the Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire crossover, and prior to that, Bungie teamed up with CD Projekt Red for a Witcher crossover (though Cyberpunk would have made more sense).


In a world where corporations are teaming up to milk their audiences for all they're worth, it's not shocking to see collaborations. However, all I ask is that they try to fit the theme of one another. Destiny is a series set in the far-flung future, so when medieval properties get thrown in, it feels very out of place. But, enough of my grousing, let's focus on the real issue: the lack of an Astarion Hunter set.

Fans of the Dune series will inevitably get through the six mainline books and couple of adaptations in a decent amount of time. If that happens to be you, here are 10 science fiction books like the Dune series.


These particular sci-fi books carry elements or ideas similar to the classic millennia-spanning series from Herbert. Some of them carry the heavy political themes, while others focus on the “chosen one” ideas. Still more carry some of the weirder features of the Dune series, such as strange powers and characters. Any Dune fan should check out the 10 science fiction books and series below.

Think back to your favorite Fortnite memories. How many involve getting run over by a guy in a vehicle? I know that that number is zero for me, and I'd guess for many of you, it's the same. Yet for some reason, Epic has decided that Season 3: Wrecked should be all about the cars.

Unlike the last few years, EA Sports has released many more versions of Icons in Ultimate Team. The addition of women's cards has introduced names like Homare Sawa, Camille Abily, and more, which has resulted in plenty of choices for the players. However, few Icons are always better than their counterparts as far as the in-game meta is concerned.


Best EA FC 24 Icons at every position


Icons are always popular choices, as they have great stats and offer bonuses to squad chemistry as well. It's no wonder that some of the most-used items, even in the esports scene, include the best EA FC 24 Icons.

The Evercade is a retro-focused family of consoles and handhelds. What distinguishes it from mini consoles, is the fact that its games are stored on cartridge. The collections Blaze releases have included games from consoles, classic microcomputers, and modern digital games, but one of the most important facets of its preservation efforts is with arcade games from developers like Toaplan and Data East.


So it makes sense to have one of its form factors be more arcade-like. It includes an 8” 4:3 screen and “competition level” arcade buttons and stick. The deluxe version comes with Sanwa buttons, but…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Were you holding off on grabbing Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth until you could get its two discs marked down? Amazon has one lined up for you. How does 20-ish% off sound?


Right now, you can nab Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth from the US Amazon site for $54.99. I’ve checked my home and native land Canada’s site, and it’s marked down to $69.99 Canadian Loonies. It’s also discounted on Amazon in Germany and the UK.


It’s a decent price for a grand and varied adventure. It’s a lot of adventure. Maybe too much. But it’s a very different sort of adventure compared to Final Fantasy VII: Remake. Sure, it still features the same mechanics, characters, and feel. Sure, it’s a continuation of the previous story (and the middle part of a trilogy), but both tonally and in terms of setting, it’s an entirely new ballgame. Also, there’s lots of time to appreciate Barrett. Barrett’s so great.


Don’t take my word for it, you can also check out Destructoid’s own Chris Carter’s 9.5/10 review.


There’s no doubt this won’t be the last time you’ll be able to grab it at a discount, but if you’ve been itching to get it without completely depleting your funds, it’s a good opportunity. It probably won’t be permanently reduced for quite a while, especially with ports to other platforms that might be coming next year.


Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth is currently available for PS5. Amazon doesn’t say how long the sale will go on, so you may want to jump on it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've always looked past Call of Duty Blackcell bundles, mostly because I don't feel like breaking the bank with its paywall. But, with the release of MW3 and Warzone Season 4, that has since changed with the thieving abilities of the Copy and Dupe Operators.


What makes them so extraordinary is their Identity Theft Finishing Move, which can steal another player's skin and place it on to your own Operator. So, if you see someone causing havoc as The Boys' Homelander, you can put 'em in their place by taking and using their skin. Call of Duty reposted a snippet of what it looks like in action, where the player Speros copies the skin of an unfortunate Warzone player.




While the result of copying the Operator skins is the primary show-stopper, it doesn't hurt that the ability just looks cool. It's as if Copy or Dupe are sucking the life out of someone, using a cloudy effect.


The only downside is that the Blackcell Operator's stealing technique is temporary. That means you'll immediately lose out on the skin upon death. However, it could bring about a challenge to see how long you can last with a particular Operator.


The Blackcell bundle will also still cost you, going for a price of $29.99 in the COD shop. This comes with the Season 4 Battle Pass, too, and a few more valuable gear.

Despite its paywall, getting ahold of Copy and Dupe in MW3 and Warzone could be worth it. You could think of it as an investment, since it gives you other exclusive skins for free, at least in a temporary sense.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Wojciech Szczesny Serie A TOTS SBC is now available in EA FC 24 Ultimate Team.  After a long wait, EA Sports has released a goalkeeper SBC, perhaps wonderful news for those who have Serie A-based items. 


Szczesny also becomes the last Serie A TOTS release, as the promo will expire tomorrow on May 31. To get this card, all you need to do is complete the tasks associated with the SBC before it's removed from Ultimate Team. 


What are the EA FC 24 Wojciech Szczesny Serie A TOTS SBC tasks?


The latest TOTS challenge has only one task, and the conditions are pretty simple as well. As this SBC is easy to complete, beginners should aim to complete this one — especially if they need a goalkeeper. 


Task 1 - Wojciech Szczesny



Min 1 player from Serie A


Min 1 player from TOTW/TOTS


Min squad rating: 86



It's better to use a fodder TOTS in this SBC, as that will allow the usage of lower-rated cards in other positions. With so many objectives currently available in Ultimate Team, completing this challenge shouldn't be an issue for anyone.

EA FC 24 Wojciech Szczesny Serie A TOTS SBC Cheapest Solution


The cost of completing the EA FC 24 Wojciech Szczesny Serie A TOTS SBC won't be very high. However, going for the cheapest solutions will help you save your resources for other content like the Serie A TOTS Upgrade SBC. 


Task 1 - Wojciech Szczesny



Paulo Dybala 86


Gabriel Megalhaes 84


Bella Bixby 84


Nacho Fernandez 83


Merle Frohms 85


Koke 84


Dabritz 84


Lucas Hernandez 84


Koen Casteels 84


Cucho Hernandez TOTS 88


Romelu Lukaku 84



After completing the challenge, you get a 94-rated GK item. It's a decent goalkeeper item, and pretty well-valued in terms of cost. There are plenty of SBCs currently live which feature outfield players. One such amazing challenge is the Henrikh Mkhitaryan SBC, which features an excellent card.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One cheeky way you can spend your points in Paper Mario: TTYD is a build that players have termed “Danger Mario.” The idea is that if you maintain Mario’s HP at 5, you can exploit badges to deal massive damage.


If you decrease Mario’s HP to 5 to push him into danger status and equip multiple Power Rush badges and some Last Stands, then Mario can take on almost any challenge. However, this isn’t fully available until much later in the game. This is because you invariably start the game at 5 HP.


In order to adjust this and achieve Danger Mario status, you’ll need to visit Chet Rippo. You can access him by going down the pipe in front of Professor Frankly’s door and using Bobbery to blow open the crack in the wall. This means that you won’t be able to reach them until after Chapter 5.

It was a staple of Saturday nights growing up, when I’d be on the edge of my seat taking in old reruns, and I have been watching the latest generation since it began in 2005. However, season 14 feels alien, and not in the usual Doctor Who kind of way. 


It’s not because of Ncuti Gatwa or Millie Gibson, that much I can be certain of. They are both undeniably talented actors in their own right, and they’re doing the best they can with what they’ve been given. Even in "73 Yards," Gibson shines in her role as a companion who has lost their Doctor and must face strange goings on alone.

The long-rumoured LEGO Zelda set has finally, officially been unveiled and, despite the cost of the adult-focused set causing many a Zelda fan to spit-take their Lon Lon Milk across the room, the 2-in-1 Great Deku Tree looks like a beauty. Of course, it absolutely should do for 300 bucks, but looking at the myriad details crammed into the 2500-piece set — which covers both Ocarina of Time and Breath of the Wild incarnations of the ancient tree — the care and attention that's gone into this latest Nintendo-themed Lego creation is obvious.
Eschewing the innovative play features of the course-based Lego Super Mario line, this build carries an 18+ age recommendation so it's clearly targeting a different demographic from the Mario or Animal Crossing sets. Those are great, but for adults it's perhaps more exciting to see larger builds and pieces meant equally for display in addition to play.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door is an RPG-lite. It includes leveling, but each time you hit a new level, you are given the choice of three stats to upgrade. That's still quite the commitment with huge consequences. So, which ones should you pick for maximum efficiency?


For clarity, the three stats are:



HP: Health points for how much damage you can take.


FP: Flower points used for abilities


BP: Badge points used for equipping badges.



FP and HP rise 5 points, while BP rises 3 points when selected during a level-up.


For obvious reasons, you need FP. Unless you are just going to keep on downing honey to use your skills, you’ll want some sort of stockpile. You might think that HP is also important, but probably not as much as you think. That’s because, in truth, BP gives you t…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For the first time in 2024, Hogwarts Legacy is releasing a free Summer update introducing new and returning features. With items like the Onyx Hippogriff, Felix Felicis potion, and the Haunted Hogsmeade Shop questline coming to the game for all platforms, the highlight of this update is the addition of photo mode. 


As the official announcement post details, you can take cinematic pictures of your character and the surrounding environment using the newly added photo mode starting June 6, 2024. Although the game featured options to disable your GUI, this is its first time introducing a proper photo mode for picture-taking. The update also includes new and returning cosmetics that were previously only available during the game's pre-order period, such as the Azkaban Prisoner's outfit, The Glasses That Lived, and the Lavender Borealis Broom. 


The update also features the Haunted Hogsmeade Shop quest that initially launched as a PlayStation-exclusive storyline, the Felix Felicis potion that reveals chest locations around the map, and a talent point reset feature if you want to try a different build in future playthroughs.

Currently, Hogwarts Legacy's Summer update will only include these main features, with no new information on DLC or New Game+ plans. While these would have been interesting additions to surprise the community, they won't be coming this time. There's no specific timeline for when or if we can expect these to appear.


As a silver lining, anyone who didn't get the chance to pre-order Hogwarts Legacy and obtain these items will have an opportunity to experience them. For those who pre-ordered and have these features already, you'll have photo mode to experiment with as the primary new feature of this update.

While the game has similar features like Sims Delivery Express and scenarios, this weekly event, the Happy at Home Login Event, allows you to claim exclusive rewards with just a few button presses. 


Starting May 30, you can claim free rewards during the Happy at Home Login Event after downloading a quick update and booting up The Sims 4. As the official announcement post outlines, you can claim four weeks of prizes, ranging from a dartboard and necklace to athletic wear and a vending machine in later weeks. Most of the rewards you'll find include Build Mode furniture items and Create-a-Sim cosmetic items, with the third week introducing the Practice Makes Perfect trait.

Alongside the Happy at Home Login Event, The Sims 4 will continue its recurring SDX drops for additional free items. The announcement also reveals new events will likely come out throughout the year for even more reward opportunities. However, there are no exact details on when the next event will appear, so for now, we'll have to focus on this ongoing one.


The Sims 4's Happy at Home Login Event is already out now, starting May 30, on all platforms. After downloading a brief update patch, you can hop on PC, Mac, or consoles to get your first reward, the Bullseye Dartboard. There are eight items total you can claim during the next 35 days, giving you plenty of time to log in if you miss a few days here and there.

According to Variety, the show “will feature an original story with new characters, showing the world of ‘Minecraft’ in a new light” and Sonic Prime animation studio WildBrain will be tacking CG duties here too.

Games inspired by The Legend of Zelda are common; after all, the long-running Nintendo franchise is among the most influential series in gaming history. Because of this, various games take the Zelda format and try to replicate it, but these homages often miss out on the magic that makes that series greater than the sum of its parts. This is particularly true in the indie space, with Zelda-inspired titles a dime a dozen, making it difficult to stand out from the crowd. Minishoot' Adventures clearly draws inspiration from Zelda – specifically A Link to the Past – but by applying…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Overworld, a realm that has captivated our world through Minecraft's various iterations, is now set to make a significant leap into our screens. From its humble beginnings to an upcoming movie, Minecraft's journey continues with an animated series, thanks to a collaboration between Mojang Studios and Netflix.


An official announcement was unveiled, featuring an explosive scene with a Creeper. The teaser, though short, leaves us with a release window of an "Animated Series Coming Soon."




With the Minecraft universe brimming with a wealth of content, the possibilities for the animated series are endless. It could delve into the enigmatic lore that the community has meticulously dissected. Perhaps it could unravel the origins of the Mobs or unveil the mysteries of the Netherworld. Personally, I'm intrigued by the prospect of exploring the genesis of the Overworld, a realm that the base game doesn't explicitly delve into.


Or, we could get an epic, adventurous tale like Minecraft Dungeons, where the main protagonist must defeat some big bad. Whichever direction it goes, I wouldn't be surprised to see a star-studded cast along with it. We already know that Jason Momoa and Jack Black will be in the upcoming Minecraft movie, so I'm curious to see what other actors Mojang Studios can pull for an animated series.


As we eagerly await further details on the Minecraft animated series, we can't help but wonder if a more concrete release date is on the horizon. Then again, the phrase "coming soon" could very well be a harbinger of a delightful surprise, with the series dropping sooner than we expect.

Given gaming's propensity for fulfilling a player fantasy in terms of might, ability, heroism, fame/infamy, and feeling rested after a good sleep, it's little wonder that Poncle's roguelike release – which spins the bullet hell genre on its head – has been receiving significant praise on Steam since it came out in 2022.


But for those who haven't played the game – or are new to it – its blend of retro-style visuals and the opportunity to "mow down thousands of night creatures" is offset by the sheer chaos and perhaps surprising difficulty, despite the aforementioned power fantasy needs that are met.

One of these was the ability to transmog armor, which many players had been clamoring for. Customizing the look of your armor is a welcome addition, but it’s easy to overlook just how to do it.


Screenshot by Destructoid


Change the color and transmog your armor in V Rising


In your inventory in V Rising, there’s a little arrow above each armor piece. Clicking the arrow will open a menu that allows you to pick from pre-selected palettes to change the color scheme of your chest, leg, feet, and hand armor.


To the left of the array of tantalizing color combos is a grayed-out icon that represents the currently selected armor slot. Transmog your gear by dragging and dropping another armor piece from your inventory onto this icon, and you can use any armor you have access to. So at level 85, you can still sport the look of that the low-level armor set that you enjoyed so much, and the Midnight Ball Gown with no armor value that you've been carrying around finally makes sense.





Change your character’s appearance with a mirror 


You can also change your character’s physical attributes in V Rising at any time, once you’ve learned how to craft mirrors. To do this, track and kill your first V Blood to complete the “Blood Hunt” quest. This will unlock the Research Desk blueprint, and interacting with the desk will reward you with the ability to make mirrors and access the character creation options.


V Rising 1.0 added all kinds of new goodies, like passive buffs, rift events, and even Castlevania's Simon Belmont the Vampire Hunter. But for those of us who enjoy decorating our castle and tweaking our appearance, the ability to transmog our gear was one of the best additions.

Save the Cat!” quests, but without any direction as to how to unlock this, it can be difficult to know where to start. 


To unlock the Save the World? Save the Cat! quests, you’ll need to head to Taoyuan Vile, which is located south west of Qichi Village. Between the two landmark locations, waits an NPC named Xiaoju who runs the restaurant nearby and has lost her cat, Lulu.

After showcasing some of the new Dread enemies, Exotic weapons, and Exotic armor, the studio has switched gears, laying out changes for existing weapons and abilities. 


In the Dev Insights post for Subclass tuning, Bungie tackled some expected issues. But the studio also had a few surprises up its sleeve for a Subclass most players have written off.

During it, Hulst explained the strategy for releasing PlayStation's single-player games on PC at a later date, rather than day-and-date, citing it's part of a strategy to bring more people into the PlayStation platform.

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/05/30/playstation-5-generation-is-already-sonys-most-profitable-yet"/>
        <updated>2024-05-30T13:42:08.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The PlayStation 5 generation is already Sony's most profitable yet, the company has announced. In terms of numbers, the PS5 generation has already earned Sony $106 billion, according to a slide from its "Game & Network Services Segment" presentation from PlayStation's two new CEOs, Hideaki Nishino and Hermen Hulst. 
However, on that same slide, Sony shows that the PlayStation 4 generation earned $107 billion, which is obviously more than $106 billion. But, the reason Sony is calling the PS5 generation the most profitable one yet is because the PS4 generation is largely complete whereas the PS5 presumably still has years to go. Given it's made $106 billion in roughly four years, it seems Sony is confident it will surpass $107 billion in the coming months or years. 
As for what Sony is including in its profits, it's the entire gamut of the PS5 generation. This includes the PS5 console itself, associated hardware and accessories, and software, too. It also includes services, like PlayStation Plus, according to the presentation. 
One of the reasons the PS5 generation might be Sony's most profitable yet is because even though the playerbase is as big as the PS4 – both are sitting at 49 million active consoles as of last month – PS5 players are playing significantly more on their console. The PS5 generation sits at 2.4 billion total gameplay hours while the PS4 sits at 1.4 billon. More playtime likely equates to more spending, which might be one of the reasons the PS5 generation is doing financially as well as it is. 
Life-to-date spending on the PS5 is also higher amongst players than the PS4, too. Across peripherals, services, content/add-ons, and content/full games, the PS4 life-to-date spend is $580 while PS5 players average $731. 
For more, read about how the PS5 recently broke a sales record for Sony, and then check out Game Informer's list of the top 10 PS5 games.

We're always a little bit wary whenever someone says that the latest game in Falcom's Trails series is "a great place to start". We know we've said in the past — as we did with Trails from Zero — but it's a statement we always put a lot of consideration into.
This statement holds a lot of weight in this franchise, both among fans, who want everyone to get the same magical experience by playing the series in the 'right order', and newcomers, who have the daunting task of playing 10 games — all between 40 and 140 hours of playtime each — across multiple different platforms. But for the newest entry coming out in the West later this year, The Legend of Heroes: Trails through Daybreak, it feels a bit different.

WildBrain, the studio behind other Netflix shows such as Sonic Prime, Ninjago: Dragons Rising, and Carmen Sandiego, is developing this CG-animated Minecraft show. Plot details are nonexistent, but a press release states the series will be "showing the world of Minecraft in a new light" and feature an original story with new characters.


This won't be the only on-screen adaptation of the best-selling video game of all time. A live-action Minecraft movie is currently in production, with Jack Black confirmed to star as Steve.  
The Minecraft show, whatever it winds up being titled, has no premiere date. In the meantime, be sure to catch up on the other video game adaptations Netflix has on the way, including the first teaser for Season 4 of The Witcher (now starring Liam Hemsworth), the first trailer for Arcane Season 2, and the first look at the animated Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft starring Hayley Atwell.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The demo for puzzle game Schim, in which you play as a boy and his frog that only exists in the shadows, is out now on Steam. I’ve given it a whirl, and its pretty froggin’ delightful. The game has you progress through different scenes set in a chill, colorful townscape. You can switch at any time between boy and frog. The boy can go anywhere, but is frequently blocked by environmental puzzles. The frog has the means to solve such puzzles, by hopping between shadows naturally cast by the environment. They act like little inky puddles, and simply jumping from one to the other is a rare joy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Understanding any given sentence in Wuthering Waves is like trying to discern sensible meaning from the back of a rain-bleached Doritos packet you found while cleaning your gutters. Last week, players of the character action gacha asked for more freedom to skip story scenes and dialogue. Having sunk a bunch of hours into the game, I can see why. The combat may be swish and the traversal across its rolling landscape flowing and carefree, but the lore-obsessed babble of its characters is mind-numbing. Wuthering Waves has been this month's lightning rod for hype. But it's worth dissecting what it's actually like to play.

After being incarcerated for six years for his involvement in one of America's most infamous car heists, it seemed that Anthony Curcio had successfully turned his life around. He began speaking at middle schools, high schools, and universities regarding the importance of drug abuse prevention and how making positive choices can lead to a more fulfilled life. So wholesome, right?
Unfortunately, it seems like Curcio is up to his old tricks. According to a report from Fox 13 Seattle (thanks, Nintendo Wire), he and an accomplice, Iosif Bondarchuk, were recently arrested over their potential involvement in scamming up to $2 million from buyers of rare Pokémon and sports cards.

You can only move through the recoil from shooting, you see, which means facing the opposite way to where you want to go. It’s both  very counterintuitive and very fun. To call something both counterintuitive and fun seems, well, counterintuitive. But also: fun. Which, as a concept is very fun to think about. But, also, quite counterintuitive. Writing such a incredibly redundant paragraph is quite fun, even though I’m just repeating myself. Counterintuitive, right? I’m going to try to escape this paragraph now.

The defendants, all linked to Germany-based EngineOwning UG, initially put up a spirited defense against alleged violations of the DMCA, Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and civil RICO, among others. By last summer, all defendants had disengaged from the legal process. At the time of writing, EngineOwning is selling its latest MWIII and Warzone cheat.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mortal Kombat 1’s next superpowered guest fighter, The Boys’ Homelander, shows off his dominance in a new gameplay trailer. The less-than-heroic superhero becomes available for Kombat Pack owners on June 4 and for everyone else on June 11.
The patriotic and maniacal leader of The Seven shows no quarter to his new MK adversaries, obliterating them with an offensive style that is very reminiscent of Superman’s playstyle in the Injustice series. The trailer also shows off the new DLC Kameo fighter Ferra, the smaller, more feral half of the Ferra & Torr team from Mortal Kombat X, who also joins the game sometime in June. 


Homelander joins Peacemaker, Invincible’s Omni-Man, Ermac, Quan-Chi, and the upcoming Takeda in the Year 1 DLC roster. Mortal Kombat 1 also has a story expansion on the way, but there’s still no word on what that will entail or when it will arrive.

Last month, Bandai Namco unveiled a first look at That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime ISEKAI Chronicles, an upcoming RPG based on the popular anime series. The game isn't set to come our way until 8th August, but to keep us going until then, the publisher has revealed the opening movie in all its animated glory.
If you were wondering how closely the game will stick to its anime source material, we'd wager that this opening movie will give you a hint. Fans of the anime will see more than a few familiar faces here, but the game promises new storylines and characters from author Fuse so there will still be a few surprises along the way.

XDefiant’s core modes offer temporarily fun stabs at the competitive multiplayer arena shooter, but Ubisoft’s latest attempt at carving out a slice of the lucrative esports pie feels half-baked. Core modes like its practice mode and ranked queue are gated off by construction tape at the time of writing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The sweat, the tears, the evil babies.
To celebrate the 10th anniversary of Mario Kart 8, George recently enlisted a troupe of willing racers (at least that's what he told us) to tackle every single track in the upgraded, DLC-laden Deluxe version in a local four-player blowout to end them all.
What follows is a twisting tale of glory and grief, friendship and failure — a fittingly epic Mario Kart marathon to commemorate a decade of both Wii U and Switch's best-selling game.

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/exclusive/2024/05/29/hive-jump-2-survivors-premieres-new-trailer-to-coincide-with-early-access"/>
        <updated>2024-05-29T15:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hive Jump 2: Survivors arrives in Steam Early Access today. To celebrate, publisher Midwest Games and developer Graphite Lab have shared an exclusive trailer for the Survivors-like sequel. The first Hive Jump caught our eye way back in 2015 when we named it one of the most promising indie titles on display at PAX West that year before its launch in 2017. The original Hive Jump served as a four-player co-op homage to Super Metroid, but Hive Jump 2: Survivors takes inspiration from a different title: Vampire Survivors.
The genre, called "bullet heaven," puts players in the shoes of a single character who eventually builds up to become extremely powerful as the waves of enemies grow more intense. Hive Jump 2: Survivors carries forward the look of its Metroidvania predecessor but from the genre-standard top-down perspective. You take control of a lone survivor of an alien attack who must now face seemingly insurmountable odds to survive. You can customize your loadout and upgrade your jetpack to destroy enemies and escape tough situations.
The jetpack also allows you to traverse the levels in ways not available in Vampire Survivors. The Jumpers have specific builds that allow you to cater to your play style, which combines with the upgrades you select before each run. You can play with auto-assist aiming or switch to manual controls. If you can survive 14 rounds, you can challenge big boss battles. As you collect goo from fallen enemies, you can earn better weapons, upgrades, and relics to improve your odds. Meanwhile, amber you find in the field can be traded for permanent upgrades to stats, magnets for auto-scavenging, or even screen-wiping nukes.
You can see an exclusive look at the Early Access launch trailer below.


Hive Jump 2: Survivors launches into Steam Early Access today. For more on the work produced by Graphite Lab, check out our review of their 2023 2D platformer, Mr. Run and Jump, here.]]></summary>

Sony has no additional details, but Some PlayStation Studios developers we have not heard from in awhile include Asobi (Astro's Playroom), Bend Studio (Days Gone), Bluepoint (Demon's Souls remake) , Guerrilla (Horizon Zero Dawn), Housemarque (Returnal), Insomniac Games (Spider-Man), Naughty Dog (The Last of Us), Santa Monica Studio (God of War), and Sucker Punch (Ghost of Tsushima). There are more, but those are arguably the developers gamers would be most excited to receive updates from.
At the very, very least, I am hoping for an Astro Bot: Rescue Mission PlayStation VR2 port.]]></summary>

Oh, and we should also mention that Sandworm numbers have increased, so be careful when taking a stroll across desert planets.

It’s been rough out there for poor Picross fans during this generation, as they’ve been cruelly starved for content with only 23 game releases on Switch (if you count the 'e' series) that offer up a paltry sum of over 5,000 puzzles to solve. Those puzzles aren’t even all original either—if you really want to be pedantic, the Mega Picross puzzles are usually repeats.
But it’s all going to be okay now. After the success of a Sega-themed Picross S Genesis & Master System Edition release a few years ago, Jupiter has now committed to another crossover, this time borrowing from Namco’s extensive arcade history with Picross S Namco Legendary Edition. What does this mean for you? Well, it’s another few hundred puzzles to complete, but this time some of them might have Pac-Man characters.

Zelnick refused to acknowledge that the studio was being closed when asked by a reporter, even going so far as to claim the opposite. "We didn't shutter those studios," he told IGN. But it seems clear from one producer's testimony that Zelnick's remarks are inaccurate.

Though a Switch release has not been confirmed at the time of writing, we remain hopeful that the eventual Steam release will pave the way for more platform launches (and maybe our enthusiasm will give publisher Radical Dreamland a bit of a nudge!). Similarly, a release date has not yet been set, so we could be in for a bit of a wait.

With an art direction and gameplay heavily inspired by A Link to the Past, this fun homage is now available in Steam Early Access and gives players the tools to craft dungeons as clever or devious as they desire. Best of all, you can upload creations for other players to enjoy and experience the works of the community. Editors Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard do just that, exploring Marcus' custom dungeon to show off some of the game's toolset before playing a (far superior) community creation.

Cadaverous, perhaps) Age of survival horror on PS1, but it's rare you play one that invokes the N64, and even less often that you stumble on something horror-adjacent that riffs on Star Fox 64. Ah, Star Fox! The natural companion piece for, say, Eternal Darkness or The Suffering. In fairness, I did always find those Pez dispenser dialogue animations pretty eerie.

It’s only a matter of time before IllFonic perfects the asymmetrical multiplayer experience. Say what you will about its previous games; each one offered entertaining tweaks to the formula, small yet clever innovations, and a seemingly better understanding of what makes this genre so compelling. Killer Klowns From Outer Space: The Game embodies all these aspects, making it one of IllFonic’s best asymmetric games yet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To kick off with some extremely half-arsed mytho-geometry, the original Frostpunk was a testament to both the design utility and the inexhaustible political symbolism of circles. When people wish to found a community of equals they commonly form a circle, with each participant visible and audible to the rest. A circle is also the best shape for defending against an engulfing ambient threat such as a global ice age, because it has no weak points, and it makes a great centrepiece for a videogame interface, a symmetrical motif that can be tuned and adorned to either suck your attention into the screen or distribute it evenly in all directions.
Created by Polish developers 11 bit, Frostpunk takes place in the middle of a circle, an Arctic crater with a huge coal generator at its heart. Your city rises in rings around that generator, each additional layer of dwellings corresponding intuitively to decreasing temperature, and the result is one of the most focused and thematically consistent specimens of its genre - a building game that feels as intimate and urgent as tending a campfire. Frostpunk 2's new campaign mode breaks the circle open. It starts where you (hopefully) ended, with the crater now fully colonised and evolved into a glaring, blue-orange geode of high-density housing and clustered chimneys. But the view has been pulled back, and construction now unfolds along the plains and canyons beyond the crater, which consist not of circles but of hexagons - another UI designer's favourite - on which you'll plot out upgradeable districts rather than assembling individual buildings.

The formal and proud fighter clashes with fellow karate practisioner Jin Kazama in the trailer and humbles the arrogant Reina by dishing out her new Rage Art. 


Lidia follows on the heels of Eddy Gordo as the two revealed Year 1 season pass fighters. Owners of Tekken 8’s Deluxe, Ultimate, or Collector's Editions automatically receive these fighters.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the biggest reasons Xbox acquired Activision Blizzard was for the Call of Duty series, a first-person shooter that has dominated the best-selling games list for decades. This would make it the perfect candidate to launch on Xbox Game Pass, Microsoft's gaming subscription service, in order to bring new subscribers in. Black Ops 6 was officially revealed last week, and while it was reported to be in consideration for a Game Pass launch, today, the news was confirmed from Xbox itself. Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will launch on Game Pass day one.
We don't know much about the game yet, but two live-action teasers have been released so far. The first features a group of people covering the faces of Mount Rushmore with blindfolds that say, "The truth lies." The second, released today, can be seen below.


It features world leaders' black and white camera footage speaking in hushed tones about a grand conspiracy about manufactured wars and the elusive nature of the truth. The trailer ends with the game's full title, along with a reminder that the full reveal will come on June 9, after Xbox's summer showcase.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lego has pulled the curtain back on its new playset based on The Legend of Zelda. The 2-in-1 aims to satisfy both old-school and new-school fans and is set to go on sale in January.
The 2,500-piece set lets owners build two scenes modeled after the Great Deku Tree from Ocarina of Time and Breath of the Wild. In terms of characters, it includes both games' versions of Link, BOTW Zelda, and the maraca-shaking Hestu. Smaller details include the cooking pot, a Skulltula, treasure chests, and a Korok tucked away on the treetop.

The Great Deku Tree 2-in-1 costs $299.99 and can be pre-ordered now on Lego's website. It will arrive in stores on January 9, 2025. It joins other sets based on Nintendo properties such as Animal Crossing, Donkey Kong, and Mario.]]></summary>

The last Silent Hill Transmission happened in 2022 and revealed a surprising amount of Silent Hill news including the reveal of the remake of Silent Hill 2, Silent Hill f, a new Silent Hill movie, and more.
The post announcing the event reads, "Consider this your invitation letter to Silent Hill. ✉️ Tune in May 30 at 4 p.m. PDT to our SILENT HILL YouTube channel for the second installment of the #SILENTHILL Transmission where we'll share game updates, a deeper look at the film, and new merch."
The safe bet is a teaser trailer for the movie and hopefully new details about the Silent Hill 2 remake and Silent Hill f, the latter of which seems like the franchise's next big original entry. Silent Hill Ascension, the online mobile narrative game where players dictated the story choices, also finished up its first season (though the developer may have a different term for it), so it's possible we may learn what's next for that game.]]></summary>

You’ll quickly realise this a school-with-no-trousers-esque dream sequence, but the matted mess of thick black cables that carpet this dingy side-stage is painfully accurate. Pissing around with gear is roughly 70% of the band experience, in my limited experience of being in bands. This probably changes when you’ve got roadies or dedicated tech people, but we did not, because we were skint. And also terrible. Several hours of Deathbulge has brought me more joy than several years of being in actual bands. I had some isolated good times in some of those bands, but I’m having a very good time with Deathbulge.

The bodies were discovered in the aforementioned murder mystery "video game", which is out now on itch.io. Following our previous reports we can confirm that exposure to the game's crime-infested city can cause severe disorientation, confusion, uncontrolled fits of laughter, and moderate enlightenment. The streets here are so dense with crime that entire apartment blocks must shutter at night. When Rock Paper Shotgun reported the 1000 corpses to detectives, we were told this was "normal" and "appropriate".

If you haven’t seen the trailer for Kingmakers, I encourage you to watch it now before continuing. If you have, or perhaps you are reading this magazine in an effort to limit screen time (you’re doing great, and we appreciate your support), I can’t continue to talk about the game without spoiling its major twist. The trailer teases what appears to be a medieval strategy game with base-building elements before a contemporary, but admittedly junky truck screams through time to arrive in the middle of a battlefield brimming with horses, suits of armor, and presumably the shouting of old English phrases, but it’s difficult to hear through the chaos.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In 2009, a video game called Canabalt was published on the iOS App Store. It had a simple premise: Your character flees through a crumbling urban landscape, making great leaps across rooftops at the touch of your phone screen. It met great success and charted in what was then only a burgeoning mobile game ecosystem. Canabalt popularized the infinite runner genre and would ultimately put its designer, Adam Saltsman, on the map.
Now working under the name of Finji as its creative director, Adam’s rise as a designer as well as his partner’s, Bekah Saltsman, as both a publisher and CEO, has been stunning to watch, especially considering the simplicity of that first big hit. Whether you’re playing the bass guitar as Mae Borowski in Night In The Woods, organizing patchwork-colored boxes in Wilmo…]]></summary>

I had the chance to catch up with director Takayuki Nakayama about the importance of the Great Demon. However, in February, I sat down with Nakayama and producer Shuhei Matsumoto to discuss the addition of Ed to Street Fighter 6. During that conversation, Nakayama shared an intriguing anecdote about how important Ed was to the development of Street Fighter 6.
When the team sits down to decide on the characters, they think of balancing out the roster not only in style, but through the regions and countries the characters represent. However, the story of the game –in Street Fighter 6's case, World Tour – also plays a big role.

“My family’s from Cuba,” says Douglas. “It was my mom’s recipe that I have transformed into my recipe. And so, the version in the game is my version, which in the Cuban community is a very controversial version, and I stand by it. I still haven’t told my mom about any of this, by the way.

The 2018 release of Frostpunk delivered a unique twist on the city-builder genre, putting you in control of a band of humans trying to survive the new ice age. Players assumed the role of The Captain as they built up their small colony of workers to a flourishing city in the post-apocalypse. Along the way, players needed to make hard decisions, like restricting food, enforcing strict authoritarian laws, putting children to work, or worse.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Senua's Saga: Hellblade II is out this week, but the starting line for developer Ninja Theory's foray into the world of action games with a focus on performance capture began with Heavenly Sword. Released in 2007 for the PlayStation 3, the game featured Andy Serkis just a few years removed from his work on the Lord of the Rings films, and is a weird action game that has incredible moments of action that doesn't last quite as long as you'd like. It's a special game to me, however, and one I am always happy to revisit. I am pessimistic, but I would love to play a version of the game at 60 FPS.

That near-decade has brought a whole heap of additions, expansions, packs and updates to the enduring life sim game, to the degree that the underlying tech serving as the foundation for dozens of later mechanical and visual elements can sometimes look a bit wobbly these days.

Perhaps best known for roles like The Watcher in Marvel's What If...?, Commissioner Gordon in The Batman, and Bernard in HBO's Westworld series, as well as his role as Thelonious "Monk" Ellison in 2023's American Fiction, which earned him an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor, Wright will return to Naughty Dog's post-apocalyptic world to give Isaac another go. 
HBO announced this today with a quick post on X (formerly Twitter) that you can see below:

The captivating, combat-free Metroidvania is rich with a delectable buffet of challenges, puzzles and secrets to find even once you’ve seen the credits roll. Still, players have chewed their way through its more-ish platforming and puzzle-solving much faster than its solo developer intended, it turns out. Luckily for us all, creator Billy Basso is already looking ahead to a new game set in the moody zoo-niverse - even if that’s not a complete sequel.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new season of Fortnite is now live, and it brings Fallout, Magneto, plenty of nitrous oxide, and some Mad Max-esque flair to the battle royale. Titled "Wrecked," Fortnite Chapter 5: Season 3 follows last season's Greek Gods-themed season with a new battle pass, new weapons and skins, and more. 
"A ferocious sandstorm recently moved over the Island, creating a new biome in the south dubbed the wasteland," an Epic Games blog post reads. "The 'Wasteland Warriors' have already called shotgun on owning the place (they did ride in with the sandstorm, after all). This crew moves as fast as their decked-out cars, proven by the places they've already established." 
We'll break down those new locations and more below.

We're not going to talk about any of that hoity-toity quantum wheeling-and-dealing in this piece, however. We're going to talk about the fact that the opening stretch reminded me of Gears Of War and the many over-the-shoulder adventures it has influenced. I'm sorry. It's been a complicated week involving minimal sleep, and I no longer have the grey cells for branching timelines, though they are certainly the more fascinating aspect of this game.

There’s Deathbulge of course, but also the upcoming Anger Foot, Abiotic Factor, and a load more I’m sure. There was also literally Door Kickers, but that was ages ago. Anyway, the latest game to put a hinge-disrespecting protagonist front and center is also my current obsession: the excellent Post Void/Hotline Miami-type beat, Mullet Mad Jack. It’s a very fast, very silly FPS about shooting robot billionaires that takes its aesthetic from 80’s anime and PC-98 games. I’m not sure what else you need, honestly.

Every so often, I see a premise for a game that really grabs me. The Alters is the latest with its unique take on the "what if" questions and multiverses. What starts as seemingly a standard survival game set on a hostile alien planet quickly introduces enticing base-building mechanics and a fun premise of escaping an ever-encroaching deadly sunrise. But it's the unique idea of the main character not only learning how different his life would have been had he made different choices at pivotal moments in his past but also being able to meet and work alongside those versions of hi…]]></summary>

Still, if we take for granted the idea that a review is only really valuable as an insight into the experience of the player: I haven’t been feeling especially great this week. That in mind: Splintered Sea is more Besiege, thoughtfully applied to its already expansive toolkit. More importantly, it's currently bringing me deep and deeply needed moments of untainted, childlike, vaguely-Orkish joy.

Besides, these specs include a gigantic 80Whr battery upgrade (doubling the ROG Ally’s 40Whr capacity), so we can at least file this under "News James wants to be true."

Innocent times and places like the prologue for Baldur's Gate, which unfolds in the vast, fortified monastery of Candlekeep (beware spoilers from this point on).
BioWare's first ever RPG opens with your unsuspecting Chosen One learning the ropes from the old sage Gorion. There are fetchquests that take you around the enormous citadel, bits of combat training to do, cosy formative chinwags to have with characters like your childhood friend Imoen. But it's not to last, of course: Gorion is murdered, and you must rove the Sword Coast in pursuit of his killer. When you return to Candlekeep later in the game, this once-proud bastion of learning has been filled with doppelgangers of Gorion and other acquaintances, a parade of chatbots waiting to stab you in the back.

        <updated>2024-05-23T18:10:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this year, Game Informer revealed the exclusive first details and screenshots of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleashed, the video game set after the events of 2023 film, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem. Following that March reveal, developer A Heartful of Games and publisher Outright Games has largely gone quiet. Today, the publisher revealed what players can expect from the Deluxe and Collector's Editions of Mutants Unleashed if they want to splurge on the game when it arrives later this year.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleashed allows you to take control of the four turtles in a 3D brawler/platformer for up to two players. The premium editions of the game will provide additional physical goodies for fans of the franchise. The Deluxe Edition includes the game, an exclusive steelbook, four pin badges, four keychains, and an artbook. Meanwhile, the Collector's Edition includes the game, Season Pass, pizza van statue, LED sign, five pin badges, four patches, a mouse mat, notebook, pen, artbook, poster, stickers, and a collector's box. The Deluxe Edition retails for $60, while the Collector's Edition will set you back $200.
Oddly enough, both the Deluxe and Collector's Editions are exclusive to the PlayStation 5 and Switch versions of the game. If you're not planning to experience this title on those systems, but still want to at least play through the game, you're in luck, as Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleahsed arrives on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC later this year.
For more on Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles in video games, be sure to read our in-depth feature on the history of the video game franchise here, and if you want something else to look forward to, read a comment from TMNT co-creator Kevin Eastman on the upcoming video game based on The Last Ronin here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Acquisitions have been rampant in the games industry recently. While the prime example on everyone's mind is likely Xbox's recent acquisition of Activision Blizzard, several have already occurred in 2024. The latest was announced today by Atari, which confirmed it is acquiring its longtime rival, Intellivision.
Atari announced it has purchased the Intellivision brand and more than 200 games from Intellvision Entertainment. As part of the deal, Intellivision Entertainment will rebrand and continue developing and distributing the Amico game console with a license from Atari to distribute new versions of Intellivision games on the console. Atari will also look to expand digital and physical distribution of legacy Intellivision games, potentially create new games, and explore licensing opportunities. 
"This was a very rare opportunity to unite former competitors and bring together fans of Atari, Intellivision, and the golden age of gaming," chairman and CEO of Atari Wade Rosen said in a press release. 
"Atari has been a valuable partner and we have every confidence they will be a responsible steward of the storied Intellvision brand," CEO of Intellivision Entertainment Phil Adam said. "We look forward to our expanded collaboration and bringing a broad array of new Atari and Intellivision titles to the Amico and Amico Home family gaming platforms."
Atari has been experiencing a bit of a re-emergence in the public consciousness lately. In addition to other acquisitions, such as Nightdive Studios and Digital Eclipse, Atari has also published well-received games like Mr. Run and Jump and Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration. For more on Atari's outlook and current strategy, be sure to listen to a 2023 episode of All Things Nintendo, which featured an in-depth conversation with Wade Rosen right here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Xbox revealed the date of its summer showcase, it included a mysterious teaser. Immediately following the presentation, there will be a second livestream to highlight an upcoming game in a "beloved" series. Today, the subject of that showcase has been revealed, and surprising no one, it's a new Call of Duty game.
Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is a title that might confuse some, seeing as there technically isn't a game titled Black Ops 5. This is because the fifth entry of the sub-series, which launched in 2021, was Black Ops Cold War, temporarily removing the numbered naming convention. The news was announced on social media, but was accompanied by a teaser on YouTube that seems to hint at the events of the game's campaign.


The 40-second clip follows a group of people sneaking onto the top of Mount Rushmore, where they place blindfolds over the eyes of the presidents carved into the mountainside. The first three blindfolds read, "The truth lies," while the fourth features a three-headed wolf logo that was used in the initial redacted teaser of the game.
The game will be revealed in full during a presentation on Saturday, June 9, immediately following the Xbox showcase that will start at 10 AM PT/ 1 PM ET. Microsoft is reportedly debating on whether or not the launch the game on Game Pass.

You also get a look at at least one of his alternate costumes.


MultiVersus is a free-to-play game and will launch on May 28 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While I’ve always thought the race towards graphical hyperrealism isn’t as pervasive as it's often perceived, Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2 is definitely one of those games. The kind that probably has twelve artists dedicated to the recreation of visible pores, that sort of thing. It’s so focused on looking pretty that it hasn’t even noticed the title and subtitle got mixed up.
Sure enough, Hellblade 2 is a harsh test for older hardware, with a heavy reliance on DLSS or FSR upscaling to keep performance sweet. That said, it’s no Dragons Dogma 2-style technical horrorshow either. A happy balance of visuals and smoothness is attainable on plush PCs and low-end laptops alike, while DLSS 3 frame generation can deliver an effective kick in the framerate pants on RTX 40 series GPUs.

Lorelei and the Laser Eyes’ setup is bland compared to the others in the puzzle genre.

The lack of context doesn’t matter, though, because the game immediately showers you with an incredible sense of mood.

        <updated>2024-05-22T16:34:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We’ve known since October 2022 that Season 3 of Netflix’s The Witcher would be actor Henry Cavill’s last as Geralt of Rivia and that Liam Hemsworth would don the silvery mane going forward. Today, Netflix released the first teaser trailer for Season 4 giving fans their first look at Hemsworth in the role.


Unfortunately, Hemsworth doesn’t speak in the brief clip, so we still don’t know how his Geralt voice compares to Cavill’s (or the games, for that matter). But he definitely doesn’t look out of place as the White Wolf and, hopefully, won’t be too much of a distraction in this new season.
Season 4 is currently in production in the UK and will be filmed back-to-back with Season 5, which will also be the show's finale. It has no release date but is speculated to premiere in 2025. These last two seasons will cover the three remaining Witcher books: Baptism of Fire, The Tower of the Swallow, and Lady of the Lake. The returning cast includes Anya Chalotra (Yennifer) and Freya Allan (Ciri). 
For more on The Witcher games, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt got its official PC mod tools this week. Read all about it here.]]></summary>

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/05/22/hunt-showdowns-new-gen-console-update-arrives-in-august-rendering-last-gen-versions"/>
        <updated>2024-05-22T14:55:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Crytek has announced the release date for Hunt: Showdown’s new-gen update, which will also conclude support for the current console versions. This update was first announced last September and will essentially force last-gen players to migrate to current consoles to continue playing the popular shooter. 
In a developer update, general manager David Fifield announced that the CryEngine 5.11 Update will go live on August 15. This update is treated as a “significant relaunch” that brings native PS5/Xbox Series X/S support along with a host of technical improvements. However, it also means the PS4 and Xbox One versions will become unplayable.
That means these players must upgrade to current hardware to continue playing their copies of the game. Crytek assures these players that if they decide to upgrade, player accounts, entitlements, and all owned DLC will transfer to the new-gen version for no extra cost. 


In addition to technical improvements, the 5.11 Update also introduces a new map and biome. In the months leading to 5.11’s launch, Crytek plans to address community and survey feedback. That includes improved reporting systems to address cheating and toxic player behavior, design reworks tackling hunter revival, health chunks, restorations, burning down hunters, and reducing stalemates. The game is also getting a new user interface, and Crytek will continue evolving the game's recruitment and prestige progression requirements. 
Hunt: Showdown first launched for Xbox and PC in 2019, with the PS4 version arriving in 2020. The PvPvE first-person shooter is set in 1865 Louisiana as players, either alone or with two or three friends, hunt supernatural bounties in the bayou while fending off other player-controlled bounty hunters.

Former vidbud Liam and I used it, initially, as something we could do while catching up on life. But now? Now we're all in. Liam has created a spreadsheet of things we're ticking off to prepare for the upcoming expansion, and I think it's the perfect summation of what the game is to us: something that makes no sense at all and yet something that makes our brains hum with happiness.
And what we've found with Destiny, in all of its bloat, is that we haven't explored for a single second since our return. Everything is accomplished through menus, making it quite Starfield-esque, which is terrible… but also good. We can't make sense of it and we don't think we ever will.

A beam of light shoots out of a mysterious planet and a zoom in reveals the beam to be an asteroid, but not just any asteroid: a crystal shaped like a teardrop, with a little ghost nestled inside. You awaken as this little ghost, who it turns out, has crash landed in Eternity (and who, it turns out, is called Hauntii). Soon you bump into a ghostly girl, who guides you to a tower that thrusts you both up to a higher plane - but though she ascends, you're dragged back to the bottom at the last moment by some netherworldly chains. And so, as Hauntii you travel through Eternity to discover who that girl was and, ultimately, how to ascend to those heavenly skies yourself.

You nod with solemn respect and you say, "Alice". An Alice is someone you should not take lightly, nor take for granted, nor leave unmonitored. For they will destroy worlds and build better ones while you are not looking. This is dangerous and exciting. Alices are a force to be reckoned with. To treat an Alice poorly is to invite shame, dishonour, and contempt. Here are some of the best Alices in video games!

This isn’t the first time the Kingdom Hearts series has come to PC. These games have been available on the Epic Game Store since 2021. But it’s always nice to see another audience experience a beloved franchise. Now everyone can get up to speed and join the wait for more news on the upcoming Kingdom Hearts IV.
The franchise’s move to Steam also comes shortly after Square Enix announced it would “aggressively” pursue a multi-platform strategy after Final Fantasy VII Rebirth and Final Fantasy XVI fell short of sales expectations. The publisher is in the midst of a structural reform that led to a swath of layoffs across its California and UK offices last week.]]></summary>

The Mario brand of RPG represents some of my favorite adventures in the genre. The comedic tone, inviting art, and active battle systems have always been highlights for me, but Thousand-Year Door was a personal blind spot. I played prior and subsequent Mario RPGs, but I skipped it when the original was released in 2004, and notably was not yet employed at Game Informer at the time. With Nintendo remastering the acclaimed RPG for Switch, I welcomed the excuse to finally play it. I am impressed by how improved the…]]></summary>

Until fairly recently the nearly 15-game-strong series, where Disney characters cross over with Final Fantasy and go to war alongside a child wielding a key (I said I don't properly understand it), wasn't on PC. After some games arrived on the Epic Games Store in 2021, Squeenix have confirmed that multiple Kingdom Hearts games are coming to Steam next month, on June 13th. Unlucky for some, maybe, but not Donald Duck and Goofy, two of the main characters. Long has Goofy been seen as just a joke character in the minds of people people who didn't watch A Goofy Movie. Hopefully this brings his heroism to a wider audience.

Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice didn’t need a sequel. It had a clear story to tell, and it told it well with an artful (and tactful) execution of its mental health themes and a strong conclusion. But Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II builds a great case for itself by using the titular warrior’s growth to help not only herself but, for the first time, others around her, shining her in a fascinating new light. Refined gameplay and a jaw-dropping presentation make for a more wholly satisfying sophomore outing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I may have winced a bit, initially, at Alice Bee’s choice of RPS Game Club game for this month. Deathbulge: Battle of the Bands looked funny and all, but it’s a turn-based RPG, a subgenre that usually elicits the same amount of enthusiasm from me as the phrase "by Ernest Cline" does from Alice. Deathbulge, however, is a clever little sod of a game, managing to devise not only a turn-based combat system that avoids the usual waiting-around tedium but one that’s outright good fun in itself.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The remake of the 1994 first-person immersive sim shooter was completely remade by developer Night Studios recently and it is finally making its way to consoles. It's the game that laid the groundwork for experiences like Bioshock, 2017's Prey, and many more in the genre, and the remake is both faithful and impressively contemporary. Join Wesley LeBlanc, Marcus Stewart, and me for a look at the game's opening moments on Xbox Series X and a discussion about the state of the genre that System Shock arguably invented.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are management games and there are micro-management games. Prison Architect 2 is the latter. I don't mean this as an annoying thing, like when Harold from corporate starts commenting all over your document at 4.30pm on a Friday. I mean it as a distinction between those games that let you plop down a house, and others that need you to stack the bricks, install the plumbing, fit the lights, and select the wallpaper. The first Prison Architect allowed you to finesse every detail of a secure correctional facility, down to each cell and dog kennel. Unsurprisingly for a sim about prison, it encouraged obsessive control. The 3D-ified sequel isn't finished yet, but it's taking a similar approach. Maybe a little too similar.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Player First Games and publisher Warner Bros. Games have released the launch trailer for its upcoming platform fighter, MultiVersus, seemingly revealing Friday the 13th's Jason Voorhees and The Matrix's Agent Smith as new roster additions. This trailer arrives just a few weeks after we learned MultiVersus finally (re)launches next week. 
After roughly two minutes of MultiVersus hijinks with various characters from the game, the Joker, which we recently learned is joining the game with a voice by Mark Hamill, is seen sitting on the Iron Throne of Game of Thrones fame. Then, mysteriously, Jason and Agent Smith appear beside him, likely alluding to them joining the launch day roster. 
Check it out for yourself in the MultiVersus launch trailer below: 


MultiVersus is a free-to-play game and will launch on May 28 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/05/20/baldurs-gate-3-dev-larian-opens-new-studio-as-development-on-two-very-ambitious"/>
        <updated>2024-05-20T12:55:58.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Larian Studios, the team behind last year's Baldur's Gate 3, has opened a new studio in Warsaw, Poland. Larian Studios Warsaw is the developer-publisher's seventh studio worldwide, and joins others in Barcelona, Dublin, Gent, Guildford, Kuala Lumpur, and Quebec. 
"With two very ambitious RPGs now starting development, what better way to see our visions realized than by growing our team and opening a 7th studio in the heart of Poland's lively gaming scene," the company's announcement post on X (formerly) Twitter reads. 


As for what those two RPGs are, don't expect a sequel to Baldur's Gate 3. Despite winning countless awards last year, including Game of the Year at The Game Awards 2023, Larian's CEO revealed back in March that the studio is done with both Baldur's Gate 3 – so no expansions – and the Baldur's Gate series in general. 
Over on a separate blog post about Larian Studios Warsaw, the company talks about its plans with seven worldwide studios open now. 
"Larian Studios set up base in one of the greatest RPG development hubs in the world – Poland, where we opened our doors in the historic city of Warsaw," the blog post reads. "Like its sister studios across the globe, Larian Studios Warsaw is dedicated to fostering an environment where developers can thrive creatively and reclaim their agency. Systems-heavy RPGs need best-in-class developers; that's why we've put the people who build those systems at the center of our culture." 
For more, read Game Informer's Baldur's Gate 3 review, and then find out why it's on Game Informer's list of the top 10 RPGs to play right now.

It's a more downbeat and mysterious finale, featuring a shadowy figure whose identity is never revealed. Also, Captain Price, the hero of the franchise and aforementioned big man number three, drops his cigar with possibly mortal implications.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Five Nights At Freddy’s 2, the sequel to the 2023 film adaptation of the popular horror game, has a premiere date. Freddy Fazbear and friends will return to the big screen on December 5, 2025.
As reported by Variety, Blumhouse Productions announced the date alongside a slate of other upcoming films, including M3GAN 2.0 and The Black Phone 2. It's not surprising to see Five Nights At Freddy’s getting a follow-up. It simultaneously premiered in theaters and on Peacock on October 27, 2023, and still managed to be a massive box office success. Grossing $297 million globally, it became the year's highest-grossing horror film, Blumhouse’s highest-grossing film ever, and the most-watched movie on Peacock for five straight days. 
The tagline for Five Nights At Freddy's 2 reads, "Anyone can survive five nights. This time, there will be no second chances." The sequel’s cast has not been announced, but the original starred Josh Hutchinson and included Matthew Lillard, Elizabeth Lail, Mary Stuart Masterson, and Piper Rubio. Director Emma Tammi is returning to direct the sequel, with FNAF creator Scott Cawthorn and Blumhouse founder Jason Blum once again assuming producer roles. 
FNAF 2 won't be the only video game film arriving in 2025. Mortal Kombat 2, the sequel to the 2021 reboot film, was recently confirmed to release in October of that year.]]></summary>

Though the sheer amount of polish and Stuff in even its pre-release form might have you thinking that a full 1.0 release can’t be too far down the line, the game’s creative director reckons we’ve still got around a year to wait before it’s considered all finished up.

It quietly does several things in a modest little way, that are all the more impressive for its lack of fanfare. The core one though, is that it takes the kind of simulationist foundation normally reserved for the punishing Dwarf Fortress derivatives or gnarly logistics games, and builds on them an approachable, gentle, even philosophical game instead. In a word: it's lovely.

No such luck here, and as previously warned, the need for said PSN sign-in to happen over Windows means that Ghost of Tsushima is essentially missing a chunk of itself on the Steam Deck.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[“In one of Nero’s many manifests,” reads a books in surreal puzzle-box Lorelei And The Laser Eyes, referring to its eccentric (read: tastefully deranged) antag-artist, “there is a satirical proposal claiming that only dictators should be allowed to direct films.” Developers Simogo - of well-deserved Sayonara Wild Hearts and Device 6 acclaim - seem to agree that’s a position worth satirising. Lorelei, despite its single-solution puzzles, is not dictatorial. It’s far too interested in collaborating with you for that. It wants you to observe, consider, and interpret its many mysteries. What’s really hooked me here is how those puzzles are kept coherent and logical, despite you getting delivered a letter by dog and occasionally visiting a floppy disk bizzaro world where you converse with a magician who manifests from his own discarded hat.

Well, scratch that August release, as now it's been shifted back to September instead! But hey, there's a demo coming out real soon that'll hopefully give us a better sense of what the game's like. I imagine it'll involve a lot of fighting spindly monsters, dying, and resurrecting at whatever object they've decided will be the equivalent of Dark Souls' bonfires. Likely something Leonardo da Vinci made or drew or invented. That man's stats were specced high.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've clocked up nearly 400 hours playing BioWare's big fantasy RPG Dragon Age: Inquisition, which is not a stat I'm particularly proud of. I'm not ashamed either, partly because, as has been identified by artist Corey Brickley, via the Maw, there's a lot of filler. Brickley has collated a list of suggested mods to slim down Dragon Age: Inquisition from a potentially 80 hours-long epic to a trim 40 hour story-focused romp, which means you might be able to play through it again in time for the launch of Dragon Age: Dreadwolf - which is a direct sequel to Inquisition.
I find this list of mods interesting! It's a way to change the game quite substantially without exactly transforming it, and it's very in-keeping with my campaign to make games 60% smaller. Still, there's at least one item on there I'd push back on, but also this isn't really a new problem for Dragon Age as a series.

This  means Melinoë can now go fishing, dig up seeds, mine silver, and gain the trust of errant shades, all in a single night's work. There is a catch though.
