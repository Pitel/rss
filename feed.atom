        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Look behind you! A three-game series!
In 1990, Ron Gilbert created the seminal point-and-click adventure The Secret of Monkey Island. It grabbed hearts and hasn’t let go for 32 years. In 1991, he concluded Monkey Island 2: LeChuck’s Revenge on a bombshell cliffhanger. In 1992, he departed Lucasarts, and the secret third part of his trilogy went down in legend like a sunken ship. Fan communities theorised and fantasised for a couple of decades about where the story might have been going, desperate for confirmation from Gilbert or his colleagues.
In 2013, Gilbert wrote, “I always envisioned the game as a trilogy” – one he could only make with “complete control over what  was making and the only way to do that is to own it.” In 2015 he wrote, “Monkey Island is now owned by Disney and they haven't shown any desire to sell me the IP.” The fans’ final gasp of what if? was snuffed. He bemoaned April Fools’ day annually on his blog, staying proudly “Fools’ day free” for 18 years. He once tweeted, “If I ever get to make another Monkey Island, I’m going to announce it on April 1st”.

We all expected Splatoon 3 to be a huge hit in Japan, but the third mollusc shooter has taken the entire world by storm since its release two weeks ago. It's even made an impact in countries where it hasn't been released! One such case is in China — as highlighted by Niko Partners Senior Analyst Daniel Ahmad — where 46% of streamers across several Chinese streaming services streamed Splatoon 3 since its 9th September launch.
This data has been taken from Niko Partners' China Games Streaming Tracker, and it shows that not only are 46% of streamers broadcasting their ink-tastic gameplay, but 72% of tips on the three services listed (DouYu, Huya, and Bilibili) have also gone to Splatoon 3 streams.

And, in the days since, the official Japanese Fire Emblem Twitter account has been sharing clips of some of your future squad members in combat — and it looks pretty darn beautiful.
First up is the main protagonist, who the internet has dubbed 'Colgate-chan'. They're actually called Alear — not quite as catchy, is it? — and they're a Divine Dragon. This short snippet shows our red and blue-haired hero inflicting a critical hit on his opponent, and from the animation to the beautiful colours, we're impressed.

In a five-minute upload on his YouTube channel, Gastrow explained how he felt he had been sitting on the sidelines for too long, waiting for "great games" to appear, and now wanted to leave a mark on the industry by applying his own understanding of the medium. Here's part of what he had to say:

Microsoft's purchase of Activision Blizzard is still under scrutiny. But in a new interview with Bloomberg, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella expresses confidence in the Activision Blizzard deal getting approved.
The UK Competition and Markets Authority is investigating the deal. After an initial phase, the regulator has opted to conduct a more in-depth "phase 2" investigation. The CMA is looking into whether the deal will have a realistic prospect of substantially lessening competition in gaming.
Speaking to Bloomberg, Microsoft CEO Nadella says he's confident the company will gain regulatory approval for the $69 billion acquisition.
"Of course, any acquisition of this size will go through scrutiny, but we feel very, very confident that we'll come out," said Nadella.
The CEO also points to Sony, which has made a number of acquisitions itself. "So if this is about competition, let us have competition," Nadella says.

Major mergers
Tensions have been rising around the Microsoft and Activision Blizzard deal. The potential merger has been under scrutiny since it was announced earlier this year, but recently, both Xbox and PlayStation have been addressing it a bit more candidly.
Reports circled that Microsoft had committed to keeping Call of Duty on PlayStation for "several more years" beyond the existing deal. In a statement to GamesIndustry.biz, PlayStation CEO Jim Ryan said the offer was "inadequate on many levels".
Sony has indeed been picking up several studios. The PlayStation manufacturer has brought on Returnal developer Housemarque, Demon's Souls remake creator Bluepoint, and Destiny studio Bungie to name a few.
The size and scope of the ABK deal for Microsoft is massive, though. The latter expects the deal to close in fiscal year 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Well, the latest answer is good news
This morning, the official Ubisoft Support Twitter account seemingly confirmed a Ubisoft Connect requirement for Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope. It was met with immediate dismay from fans, on the very day the game had gone gold. After the tweet was swiftly deleted we reached out to Ubisoft for comment — but that same account later cleared things up.
The new tweet states rather succinctly: "A Ubisoft Connect account isn't mandatory for players to play Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope, contrary to what has been wrongfully mentioned by one of our previous tweets." It seems to be a definitive statement on the matter, as a direct follow-up and acknowledgment of the prior error. In any case, with Nintendo heavily involved, it would be a bad look if a single-player adventure game required a third-party sign-on.
Ubisoft has been pushing Connect wherever it can, and is still operating the Ubisoft Connect launcher (formerly uPlay) and storefront. Conversely, several studios have closed down or otherwise downplayed their launchers, in favor of migrating to more prevalent platforms. It's one thing to have it strewn about an Assassin's Creed game for bits and bob bonus points, but it's not going to get quite that same pass with Sparks of Hope.
The mere mention of a login requirement really brought me back to the 2010s, and the battle of the launchers, though: when you had the added baggage of extra logins, but none of the bonuses like cross-play. It was a dark time.

If you were a friend of mine around the launch of the Special Edition of Secret of Monkey Island, I probably tried to thrust it upon you. I was in the midst of exploring the point-and-click adventure genre, as I had passed it by when I was young, and Secret of Monkey Island was the new high point. Maniac Mansion is a wonderfully well-designed puzzle box, but Secret of Monkey Island is a symphony. Its puzzle design is near perfect, and its humorous script makes it extraordinarily rewarding to solve them.
Monkey Island 2 might be better than that, but following those two hits, the series took a dive. Curse of Monkey Island, Escape from Monkey Island, and Tales of Monkey Island are all fine. Okay even. But the first two games weren’t fine, they were magic.

For as many granular simulation games as we get these days, it's not that common to see a full-on numbered sequel. But 2018's House Flipper broke through with three million copies sold across PC and consoles, and that was enough for House Flipper 2 to get the green light. Here's our first look at gameplay, including a noticeably less "basic" art style.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOQCo2rLpdU
I liked the original game for what it was, though I ended up craving a more complete experience with a bigger scope. Cleaning up nasty homes and renovating them is a concept that pretty much sells itself in the simulation space, so I'm happy to see the developers at Frozen District try again, presumably with more runway this time.
The big change: on top of the returning Story mode, there's going to be a Sandbox mode in which you can "build homes from scratch" rather than just shore up existing ones.
 "We’ve put a lot of heart and story into House Flipper 2, polishing our trusty tools, focusing on player creativity, and adding mysteries to uncover," said lead producer Jakub Bujas in a press statement. "We think returning fans and brand new players alike will enjoy relaxing, creating, and exploring the community of Pinnacove."
With the widespread warm reception to PowerWash Simulator recently, I feel like more people are giving these sorts of games a chance. And as much as some publishers take a shotgun approach to figuring out the next big sim subject matter (with plenty of duds in the process), among those games that do resonate, the quality bar seems to be rising.
If I'm being honest, I'd play a simple "home-cleaning simulator" — it's oddly relaxing! — but having a well-rounded renovation and home-building loop will go a long way.
House Flipper 2 is coming to Steam sometime in 2023, and PlayStation and Xbox versions are also planned.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's out on December 9
Dragon Quest Treasures is sneaking up on us, as it poises for a December 9 release on Nintendo Switch. It hasn't exactly been on my mind given the sheer number of games coming out in October and November, but this new overview trailer perked me up.
In short, this spinoff deals with Erik and Mia, a brother and sister duo who "dream of exploring the world in search of grand treasure." To do so, you'll team up with various monsters, who can provide various abilities to the party to find...more treasure. The gameplay loop seems incredibly carefree, mixed with the signature style of the Dragon Quest series.
In the below four-ish minute video, Square Enix runs you through the basics, including treasure hunting itself (including the various means of traversal), as well as recruitment, the hub/base mechanic, and the main storyline (which deals with rival gangs and the narrative involving the seven rare Dragonstones). Party building in particular looks fun, as your minions can also act out of combat: serving as mounts, and abilities of sorts (like having one throw you up in the air).
Like Monster Hunter, I always at least give these Dragon Quest spinoffs a second look. The series has built up so much goodwill at this point, and if I can fit it into my schedule, Dragon Quest Treasures seems like it'll be a breezy December/winter game.

The fantasy-themed Borderlands spin-off game Tiny Tina's Wonderlands might have seemed like an experimental one-off, but it's been successful enough that Gearbox considers it a new franchise, with "future experiences already under development."
Gearbox Entertainment CEO Randy Pitchford spoke about Wonderlands at Embracer Group's annual general meeting, as transcribed by Video Games Chronicle.
Summing up Tiny Tina's Wonderlands as a "major victory," Pitchford added that the fantasy-tabletop-inspired game "shattered all of our target expectations, both critically and commercially," and that "in addition to great financial rewards from this victory that will be coming our way in the coming quarters, we have established a firm beachhead."

Ooblets is one of those games I followed from its announcement all the way back in 2016 up to its release, so it suffices to say this was a highly anticipated game for me. Stardew Valley meets Pokemon is a hell of a logline, and the combination of those gameplay elements compared with the game’s cute, colorful art style basically made it feel like it was made specifically for me. The game went into early access in 2020, but this month it got its full 1.0 release.
You’ve got all the usual mechanics you’d expect from a game like this — farming, fishing, foraging, cooking, befriending villagers — as well as some new twists. You can see clear inspiration from farming sims like Stardew, and yet Ooblets still manages to fe…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Valhalla will wait a little while longer
Valkyrie Elysium is right around the corner. But its companion re-release of an old Valkyrie title will take some more time. Square Enix confirms today the re-release of Valkyrie Profile: Lenneth is delayed to December.
Originally a PSP port of the PlayStation 1 classic Valkyrie Profile, Lenneth is set to get a PS4 and PS5 version too. It was meant to coincide with the launch of Valkyrie Elysium on September 29. But to bring it all together, Square is taking a little extra time.
"As we celebrate the launch of Valkyrie Elysium, we unfortunately need a bit more time for Valkyrie Profile: Lenneth to improve the quality of the title and have decided to move the release date to December 22nd, 2022," the statement reads.
https://twitter.com/ValkyrieGame/status/1572913851783421952
Those who pre-ordered the Digital Deluxe version of Elysium will still be able to get their copy of Lenneth. It will, however, be arriving several months later than expected.
Swapping profiles
It's hard to not be curious about why this particular part of Valkyrie Elysium's rollout has been pushed back. It would put Valkyrie Profile on a modern console, which would be a huge boon for folks who want to dive back into that story.
Still, a little more time is worth it if it means a good port. And now this puts Lenneth squarely within the holidays. No better way to celebrate family and give thanks than recruiting soldiers for the impending war of Ragnarok.
Valkyrie Elysium, meanwhile, is still arriving on September 29 for PS4 and PS5. I got a chance to check out the demo ahead of its launch. The combat is surprisingly solid, even as it moves the needle from RPG over to action. That demo is available now, if you want to give it a shot.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Finally, golf for everybody (with a Switch).
Clap Hanz is a studio closely linked with PlayStation, producing hugely popular titles Everybody's Golf / Hot Shots Golf across multiple generations (over the course of 20 years+). Recently it loosened up its swing and went another way, however, releasing Clap Hanz Golf on Apple Arcade. It's that title which is now on Switch as Easy Come Easy Golf; yep, brand identity with this developer can get a bit muddled.
For those that never jumped into the PlayStation games, this is a welcome chance to experience the studio's blend of easygoing visuals, cartoonish caricatures and decidedly addictive golf. It's a refined round for sure, and thanks to those smart device origins it supports multiple ways to play — you can opt for touchscreen swipe controls in portable mode, while on a controller you can utilise stick swings or the more classic three-button press. All are certainly functional, but this reviewer is a boomer that insists golf games be played with the three-tap meter, and it works nicely here.

The animated film, starring Chris Pratt as the titular plumber, will hit theaters on April 7, 2023. The biggest question regarding the film has been what Pratt’s Mario performance will sound like, and we may finally get to hear it in just a few weeks. The movie’s first teaser trailer premieres on October 6 at 4 p.m. ET during the New York Comic Con.

The Super Mario Bros. cast also includes Charlie Day as Luigi, Anya Taylor-Joy as Peach, Jack Black as Bowser, Keegan-Michael Key as Toad, and Seth Rogan as Donkey Kong. The film was delayed to ensure quality, though Nintendo was reportedly been pleased last year with how the film was shaping up at that point. Pratt recently described his performance as “unlike anything you’ve heard in the Mario world”, and it apparently won't have an Italian accent.]]></summary>

Epic Games Store has revealed the two new titles that it will be offering up gratis this week. As of Thursday, September 22, all EGS users will be able to download Studio Wildcard's Ark: Survival Evolved and Asmodee Digital's Gloomhaven completely free of charge.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fIAPcVdZO8
Released for PC and consoles way back in 2017, Ark: Survival Evolved is — as its name denotes — a survival title set in an anachronistic prehistoric world. As a human outfitted with more modern technologies, players must build bases and habitats within a huge open world, gathering resources and increasing defenses while fending off attacks from rampaging packs of dinosaurs and potentially hostile human players. Players can also capture and tame dinosaurs for transport and guard duties.
Originally released for Steam Early Access back in 2015, developer Studio Wildcard has slowly built upon the original title in the ensuing years, adding more features, PvE modes, additional dinosaurs, and expansive new lands, objectives, and questlines. Ark: Survival Evolved would be ported to mobile and Nintendo Switch in 2018, and the Stadia platform in 2021.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SGDEP-zFHo
Developed by Flaming Fowl Studios, Gloomhaven is a digital adaptation of the fantasy tabletop title of the same name. Set against the backdrop of the grim titular 'berg, players guide packs of class-based mercenaries on quests and missions, utilizing their characters' unique skills and abilities to overcome any opposition. The digital edition of Gloomhaven is, more or less, a direct adaptation of the tabletop game, following the same rules and objectives of its physical source.
Both Ark: Survival Evolved and Gloomhaven will be free on the Epic Games Store from September 22 until September 29.
Next week's free games will be Runbow and The Drone Racing League.

Diddy Kong and Pauline are the latest free DLC/update characters for Mario Strikers: Battle League, and they're out now.
Originally confirmed in the recent September Nintendo Direct, this is actually a full-on update for Battle League, billed as version 1.2.0. It not only adds the aforementioned content (Diddy Kong, Pauline, the Planetoid stadium, and more gear), it also serves as an adjustment patch of sorts. CPU teammates are now snappier, charge times for perfect passes have been tweaked, and you now earn more coins in general. Clubs will also now be barred from participating in a season for 30 days of idle time as opposed to 90 days if no one appears online during that time period.
Note that this follows the prior July update (1.1.0), which added Daisy, Shy G…]]></summary>

If you are unfortunate enough to have not graced Twitter in the past 24 hours (we don't necessarily blame you), then you probably will have missed the meteoric rise of Trombone Champ, and with it's Mii-style visuals, it had us feeling a bit reminiscent.
This Guitar Hero-inspired game from Holy Wow Studios is an absolute hoot (or should we say toot?) and the internet has gone wild for videos of people butchering musical classics such as Beethoven's 'Fifth Symphony' and the national anthem for both the UK and US.

League of Geeks, the team behind Armello, is diving into the vault and bringing back a cult-classic. The studio's next title is a reimagining of Solium Infernum, a political strategy game that pits would-be rulers against each other for the highest seat in Hell.
Originally released in 2009, Solium Infernum did not receive a ton of widespread attention. Victor Davis' strategy game, created under the studio Cryptic Comet, did latch on with some particular journalists and blogs though. Long series like one over at Rock Paper Shotgun dove deep into the politics and strategy, finding a lot to like about it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The RPS-beloved turn-based strategy game Solium Infernum is back from the dead. Announced earlier today on stage at EGX London 2022, Armello creators League Of Geeks will be resurrecting and reimagining the game in 2023. Originally released in 2009 by solo dev Vic Davis and his studio Cryptic Comet, Solium Infernum cast you as an Archfiend hoping to stake a claim for Satan's empty throne. With a strong emphasis on political intrigue and Machiavellian backstabbing over taking things by force, this strategy game from hell was a firm RPS favourite back in the day, spawning an eight-part diary series of the team's play-by-email multiplayer adventures. Alas, it never quite found the audience it deserved back in the early 2010s, eventually causing Davis to shut up shop completely in 2015 and pursue a career in tabletop.
League Of Geeks are here to change that, though, and after speaking with studio director and co-founder Trent Kusters (both at EGX earlier today and during a hands-off presentation of their pre-alpha demo late last week), it's clear the team have taken great care in bringing Solium Infernum up to date for modern audiences. It leans into all the same kinds of mind games as Cryptic Comet's original, and its simultaneous turn structure is still very much intact – just with lusher 3D visuals, and all-new, revamped menu screens. And it looks devilishly good.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's out on September 27
A Capcom Fighting Collection update is on the way, and will feature several quality-of life enhancements like viewable hitboxes.
Due out on all platforms on September 27, Capcom has boasted the following updates:
Viewable hitboxes
New gem colors for Puzzle Fighter
The option to see your opponent's connection status
So the first one is obviously the crown jewel, as it'll allow players to view more technical information when training, presumably across the entire array of games in the collection. It'll be fascinating to see if any new tech arises from some of the more obscure titles in those scenes. Gem color options for Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo is just how it sounds, and seems like an aesthetic update, but will actually add more options for colorblind players. The network connection status addition will be more helpful, especially since Capcom is teasing that it works while viewing potential matches in lobbies.
As a recap, here are the games included in the Capcom Fighting Collection:
Darkstalkers: The Night Warriors
Night Warriors: Darkstalkers’ Revenge
Vampire Savior: The Lord of Vampire
Vampire Hunter 2: Darkstalkers’ Revenge
Vampire Savior 2: The Lord of Vampire
Hyper Street Fighter II: The Anniversary Edition
Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo
Super Gem Fighter Mini Mix [Pocket Fighter]
Cyberbots: Full Metal Madness
Red Earth

Recently we were invited down to Nintendo's UK headquarters by Ubisoft – we can only assume they got permission first – to have a bash at the upcoming strategy bwaaah-athon that is Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope.
We sat down and were able to play around three hours of the turn-based tactical crossover sequel, and despite one somewhat embarrassing oversight in the game's mechanics in one part of one of the planets we visited, we had rather a good time with it, to say the least.

It reminds me of those cuckoo clocks where on the hour every hour a tiny door opens revealing two mechanical dolls that come together and have a 'lil smooch. That’s essentially how Wayward Strand works but on a bigger scale. Characters are set on strict routines, following predetermined paths and schedules that are often invisible to you. They welcome an interruption - a friendly natter or helpful hand - but whether you’re there or not, they’ll go about their business regardless. The world keeps on spinning and all that.
It’s an interesting way of capturing the passage of time, and in Wayward Strand how you choose to spend that time is pretty important in a game that makes a point of not waiting for you.

So breaking this down, you basically just want to choose your side in the Splatfest immediately, or as soon as possible before playing matches. After that, everything you earn will be above board. Nintendo notes that the bug "will be fixed in the future," so thankfully it's just for this particular Splatfest. Again, this only applies to the event happening this weekend.
In any case, it's good to see Nintendo pounce on these issues quickly, before they get out of hand. The first few weeks of support can be crucial for maintaining a long-term playerbase, and I'm looking forward to whatever "long-term solution" they have for Splatfest 4v2v2 Tricolor matches. The pre-launch event was pretty much the only shaky experience I had with this game, so if they can nail that, they can add some momentum.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[And Dragon Quest X dominates.
Newsflash — Splatoon 3 is still inking all over the charts in Japan (and everywhere, really!). Following last week's bumper sales, this week's Famitsu Japanese charts reveal that, despite an expected drop in sales, the third mollusc-based shooter has still managed to shift an incredible 506,610 physical units. That means physical sales for Splatoon 3 are already almost at 2.5 million copies.
The other big news is Dragon Quest X: Rise of the Five Tribes Offline's release. This offline version of the Japan-exclusive MMORPG has sold nearly three times as many copies on Switch as it has on PlayStation 4 or 5 — but all three releases make up three of the top-five selling games of the week. Dragon Quest is a big deal in Japan, so we're not that surprised at all, but we did have to smile when we saw positions 2, 3, and 4 were all Dragon Quest. Only inklings and octolings can keep the dragon at bay, it seems!

Picture this — a 1v1 fighter, with warriors who use swords, and the chance to kill your opponent in one hit? You thought of the PlayStation classic Bushido Blade, didn't you? And it's about time we finally got a spiritual successor. And that's exactly what Grindstone and Triple Hill Interactive's brand new game, Die by the Blade, is trying to do.
Funded via Kickstarter back in 2020, and inspired by the aforementioned unique beat 'em up alongside Dark Souls and Way of the Samurai, players will be able to face off against their opponents in a samurai-punk world in nail-biting combat. Who will get the first hit, and will they be able to kill them in one go? The game is coming to consoles and PC on 3rd November, but Switch owners will have to wait until 2023 to hold our katanas.

Shovel Knight may never die — and I'd be completely okay with that! The franchise, born in 2014 with the original entry, created a cottage industry for Yacht Club Games, who incorporated the series into multiple projects and has spawned an empire of sorts. While we wait for Mina the Hollower to arrive, there's more Shovel Knight coming your way this month.
Shovel Knight Dig, a roguelite platformer, is the latest attempt to mix things up. Thankfully, it's very close to the spirit of the original game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["Now dig on this".
Since the last 8-bit-style game came out, Shovel Knight has been branching out more into other genres as developer and publisher Yacht Club charts a course for where its eponymous nobleman will go next. In December, we got the wonderful Shovel Knight Pocket Dungeon, which smartly blended falling block puzzle mechanics with roguelite game design. Now, we’re getting another roguelite in Shovel Knight Dig, only this time the gameplay is much more in line with the action-platforming of the original game. As you’d probably expect of this franchise by now, it’s an absolute blast to play; developer Nitrome (Bomb Chicken) delivers a tough, rewarding, and enjoyable new experience that series aficionados will want to dig into immediately.
Shovel Knight Dig takes place sometime before the original Shovel Knight, so Shield Knight hasn’t disappeared yet and the Enchantress has yet to rise to power and form the Order of No Quarter. Here, the main villain is a new character named Drill Knight, who has formed a group of knights called the Hexcavators to help him in raiding a treasure room buried somewhere deep within the earth. Their efforts to do so—and the enormous hole they’ve created—are creating problems for the people on the surface, so Shovel Knight and Shield Knight dive in to try to get to the bottom of what’s going on.

With its top-down story mode, retro pixel art style and clearly Zelda-inspired sprites, it is frankly a wonder that Wizorb has never made its way over to Nintendo consoles before.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Have you ever played a game and thought, "Are we actually the bad guys here?" Usually, the whole "we're fighting on the wrong side of history" line is a deliberate plot device in RPGs, offering moments of clarity to not only peel back the curtain and provide fresh impetus for the events yet to come, but also to cleverly reframe everything you've achieved so far. I don't say this to spoil the events of The DioField Chronicle, the new real-time strategy game from Lancarse and Square Enix, but it is a question I found myself asking a lot during its middle act - and it never quite delivers the punchline you're looking for. 
Around 8-10 hours into the game, there's an extended portion of the campaign that sees your band of Blue Fox mercenaries bringing an entire region of DioField Island to heel because they're, err, pro democracy. Of the cast's central quartet, only one stands up as a voice of reason when motions are made to quell these despicable riots, but he's repeatedly shot down every time he tries to offer an alternate view. Eventually, one character says to him, and I quote, "Isca, what has got into you? You ought to know the danger posed by the ideology of democracy." It's an odd stance for someone clearly not a villain to take in 2022, although really, I should have probably seen it coming. Our mercs work for a duke after all, and most are aristocratic nobles who are handy with a sword. Oh no. I think this might actually be played: Tories - The Game. Yuck.

The Dark Souls III PC servers were back up, and now it seems they're back down again. Players are reporting in, unable to access the game, and the social account has acknowledged a confirmed issue.
As noted by PC Gamer, speculation had started picking up yesterday on the Steam forums, where users were starting to have issues with the servers.
A new tweet from the Dark Souls brand account on Twitter notes that there is a confirmed issue with Dark Souls III online play, via the Steam platform.
"We are investigating the source of the problem and will inform you as soon as more details become available," the update says. "Thank you for your patience."

Rise again, Ashen One
The PC servers for Dark Souls III were off for quite a while. Users discovered an exploit in the Souls series that has kept its PC versions offline for most of the year. Online PC services only just recently came back online for Dark Souls III. The team behind the updates had previously said they were working on bringing services back for the other back-entries in the Souls series, but now it looks like Dark Souls III may need more attention.
Meanwhile, Elden Ring had the specific vulnerability addressed pre-launch and has been cooking along just fine. So for PC players, the only FromSoft multiplayer game in town is Elden Ring once again.
It's a bummer, as each game has had its own meta-game and PvP communities. Numbers even seemed to jump up a bit for Dark Souls III after the fix was implemented.
Though no specifics have been given, hopefully this fix doesn't take months like the others have. We'll learn more as the Souls team works on getting the Dark Souls III PC servers back up.

It's a known fact that it takes a long, long time to make games, but Cloud Imperium Games is testing gamers' patience with their in-development title Star Citizen, which began pre-production all the way back in 2010. The game was officially announced in 2012 with the launch of a Kickstarter campaign to raise funds for development, and while it was anticipated to release in 2014, the game was delayed multiple times... and still is yet to receive any sort of official release window.
Ten years after the launch of the Star Citizen crowdfunding campaign, the game has reached an incredible milestone by raising over $500 million — the official count as of today is $500,075,150 from 4,096,384 backers. (Thanks, Eurogamer.) I'm not sure if I'm mor…]]></summary>

At this point, I'd go into some sort of recitation of how Trombone Champ sets this all up. Maybe how it handles, or what buttons it uses to do the things it does. The mouse moves a cursor up and down in inverted fashion, and your mouse click or any keyboard button is held to play notes.

After much speculation and some leaks, Logitech has lifted the lid on its new built-for-cloud-gaming handheld system, the Logitech G Cloud, ahead of its October 17 launch. It's a device for players who actively use services like Xbox Cloud Gaming or Nvidia GeForce Now (or even Steam Link), but plenty of us are still only dabbling in this stuff at best.
The handheld Android device has a 7-inch 1080p touchscreen, a supposed 12-hour battery life, and "haptics, gyroscope, and remappable control," according to Logitech. I will say, it's a sleek design. The Logitech G Cloud is 10.11 inches by 4.61 inches, and weighs 463 grams, which would sandwich it between the Nintendo Switch and Steam Deck.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo confirms what most assumed
How is Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom pronounced? Well that's easy, because we have an official answer from Nintendo! As reported by Eurogamer, Nintendo has clarified that it's "tears," as in the "crying" variety, not tears, like tearing a piece of paper. I can see the eyerolling now, but this was debated by some for a hot minute!
Given the dark tone and how things seem to be in disarray in this new entry, "tears" (again, crying) of sorrow is what immediately went to my head. However, as many have pointed out, much of the kingdom seems to be literally torn apart in the game's various trailers, with plenty of floating structures that would feel right at home in a Miyazaki movie. It's entirely possible that "tears" (crying) could be literal items that you pick up in the game, or directly incorporated into the story in some way. Nintendo has plenty of time to showcase story details in various streams and reveals.
Here's all we have to go off of for now: "In addition to the vast lands of Hyrule, the latest entry in the storied Legend of Zelda series will take you up into the skies!"
In any case, it's going to take me ages to not refer to this as Zelda: Breath of the Wild: Tears of the Kingdom. I mean I almost typed that out multiple times when talking about the game, even in this very article! Despite being billed as a full sequel to Breath of the Wild, there's no "2" in the moniker, and it's going its own way. It makes perfect sense, as word will travel that it's a direct follow-up anyway.
We'll see how much Breath of the Wild DNA is truly baked in when it arrives on May 12, 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA['Tis the season for more Picross
Jupiter is back to bring some more Picross action to the Switch. Picross S8 has been announced for the Nintendo Switch, arriving on September 29 with a cool feature: four-player co-op.
In Picross S8, up to four players will be able to co-op solve Picross puzzles on a single Switch. Each player will need their own controller, but you can use single Joy-Cons for each person if you'd like.
Seeing it in action can feel almost bizarre. Different colored bars and crosshairs jaunt around the board, and it looks like players rack up points for their correct guesses.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIBaaQajwyI
For me, Picross is often a solo exercise of light brain puzzling and the good feeling of getting a guess right. It fills the same space as logic puzzles or sudoku. But I can see how, especially with the big boards, it would be fun to get a bunch of people in. Plus, it would probably make teaching a family member or loved one how to play Picross pretty easy.
Even more puzzling
Of course, on top of the new feature in co-op, there is plenty of Picross to tackle. 300 Picross and Mega Picross puzzles are included in Picross S8. There are also 150 Clip Picross puzzles, 30 Color puzzles, and five extra puzzles. That total count is 485 puzzles, if you lost track.
Linking play data from Picross S4, S5, and S6 also unlocks three Extra puzzles. It is a chance for even more Picross to uncover, either with friends or all by yourself.
This marks the eighth Picross S entry on the Switch for Jupiter, and the studio has become pretty good at rolling these out at a regular pace. Just like the seasons change and leaves fall, a new Picross is probably around the corner. I'm still waiting for the day we get another Picross 3D, but I'm always happy to have some new puzzles on my Switch for my next long stretch of travel.

We are just a few weeks out from the Nintendo Switch port of the exciting and highly melodramatic NieR: Automata. Publisher Square Enix has released a new trailer showing off the PlatinumGames-produced action-adventure, also taking the time to spotlight some exclusive new DLC content.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiWGORJRNr0&t
The Switch port, titled NieR: Automata — End of YORHA Edition, will already feature all of the post-release skins, gear, and other additional items featured in its PlayStation, PC, and Xbox brethren, but will also include the all-new "6C2P4A118680823" DLC pack, which will include new character costumes for protagonists 2B, 9S, and A2, as well as new looks for their respective pods. The DLC includes outfits based on the recent remake NieR: Replicant, as well as some traditional Japanese garb, including samurai and kunoichi gear, complete with fox masks.
NieR: Automata first launched on PS4 back in 2017 and has slowly gathered a larger and larger audience in the ensuing years. The dizzying hack 'n' slash title tells the story of a war between mankind and the machines, and the fates of the sentient androids that are placed right in the center of the interplanetary conflict. NieR: Automata has won praise for its bleak, dystopian world, dramatic storytelling, smart enemy design, and its unforgettable protagonist, 2B, who has fast become a gaming icon. And with the release The End of YORHA Edition no doubt bring further acolytes are to be brought into the fold.
NieR: Automata — End of YORHA Edition launches October 6 on Nintendo Switch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["It will no longer be possible to sign in to a Nintendo Account using Facebook or Twitter"
As far as Nintendo Accounts are concerned, the Nintendo Facebook and Twitter linking feature is ending very soon — next month, in fact.
The company has provided an October 25, 2022 end date, at which point everyone who uses those two options will need to sign in using their Nintendo Account email address/ID, or a Google/Apple account. This applies across the board to all Nintendo Accounts, even on Nintendo Switch, so it's not a legacy/Wii U/3DS thing.
What does this even mean, exactly?

Note that a lot of folks can safely ignore this option, though some of you might be impacted. As you can see in the example sign-in screen above, there's an option to use Facebook or Twitter directly, in addition to Google, Apple, and a direct Nintendo Account login.
So roughly seven years ago, Nintendo touted the ability to sign into a Nintendo Network account with Facebook and Twitter as a way to acquire customers more easily. But a lot has changed since then, particularly when it comes to information security. While Nintendo hasn't given a concrete reason for why they're making this change, it's coming regardless, so you might need to prepare yourself for the October 25 end date. For the time being, it has been clarified that Google/Apple sign-ins will stay.
To be extra clear, the ability to share screens and the like on Twitter and Facebook will remain, this change is solely for Nintendo Account sign-ins.

Microsoft has quietly tweaked the infrastructure of its shiny Xbox Series X hardware to now allow the playing of Xbox One games without the need for an online DRM check.
The new "feature," which is included in the console's 2206 Update, will allow Xbox Series users to play their Xbox One games in an offline capacity. Previously, the console would always do a brief online handshake to ensure that the Xbox One game in question was an authentic, licensed title and not a copied disc — The Xbox Series S, being discless, obviously had no need to perform this additional step.
Speaking on Twitter, Xbox engineer and great-named person Eden Marie confirmed the update.
"Yes, this is true since the 2206 update," wrote Marie. "We examined data since Series X/S launch & determined the online compatibility check isn't needed in the vast majority of cases for Xbox One discs. Some games may still need to be updated online after install to ensure the best experience."
While this is a different situation entirely, one cannot help but recall the PR disaster that occurred prior to the Xbox One console's release, where Microsoft stated that an online connection was a mandatory demand for the playing of Xbox One games, to ensure that the player had indeed purchased a license for each and every title. While this would eventually prove not to be the case, there's no denying whatsoever that the initial statement was a Sword of Damocles over the brand, and certainly contributed to sales of Xbox hardware declining at the start of the eighth generation.
The 2206 Update is now live on Xbox Series X/S platforms.

For its 10th anniversary, Wizorb is coming to Nintendo Switch on October 6, 2022.
If you were big into Xbox 360 during the Xbox Live Indie Games heyday, you might be pumped too. But if you've never heard of Wizorb before (despite its later ports, including Steam), then you should check it out. It's classic arcade gameplay with light RPG touches.

Next month, the legendary Persona franchise will take to the stage once again, as the returning Persona Super Live P-Sound 2022 concert will regale a packed auditorium with a playlist of memorable and distinctive tunes pulled from the iconic JRPG series. However, anyone expecting any sort of reveal may want to keep their expectations in check...
According to a statement by publisher Atlus, the concert will not be used as an opportunity to reveal any new games set within the reality-bending universe. Fans can expect some awesome music, live vocals, bafflingly written lyrics, and appearances from the series' voice cast — but if you go in expecting a Persona 6 announcement, then you might come away a little disappointed. With ringing ears, tapping toes, and having had a great night, mind, but disappointed.
It's understandable that some fans might be getting a tad antsy, given that the smash-seller Persona 5 debuted way back in 2016, following a development cycle that lasted practically an entire generation. Since then, Atlus has released several new spin-offs, including musou-like Persona 5 Strikers, two new Persona Dancing titles, and Persona Q2: New Cinema Labyrinth for Nintendo 3DS. But if you're holding out for Persona 6 announcement, keep holding, friend. After all, even when we get the inevitable reveal, how long is that dev cycle going to be?

The Xbox Game Pass list for September has been published by Microsoft, and there's a few really great additions this month.
Deathloop is the clear-cut big one here, given that it was previously a PlayStation exclusive, and a punt for a lot of folks. The premise isn't for everyone, and even after a fairly positive critical reception, I don't blame anyone for wanting to wait on the fence for it. A Game Pass release ending an exclusivity period is the perfect combo.
The rest of the list isn't slouching either. Hardspace: Shipbreaker adds some variety to the mix, as does Slime Rancher 2. Another big round comes in late September, with Grounded (a major Obsidian/Microsoft release) hitting the service on September 27, followed by a Valheim game preview. Again, a lot of Game Pass offerings are nailing it in terms of adding a good chunk of "wait and see" projects. For many, since it launched in early access in early 2021, Valheim is one of the biggest examples of that. It's still slated for a 2023 full release, by the way.

Week of September 19:
Deathloop, September 20 (Cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X|S)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Apple TV show Ted Lasso has proven to be one of the most popular and well-liked series of the last few years, introducing viewers to a lovable cast of characters whose lives and storylines largely revolve around the fictional English Premier League football club, AFC Richmond. Through its first two seasons, the series has taken home numerous awards, including the Primetime Emmy for Outstanding Comedy Series in 2021 and 2022, with several of its actors – including Jason Sudeikis, Brett Goldstein, and Hannah Waddingham – taking home awards for original performances. Now, Ted Lasso reaches into a new realm: video games. 
EA Sports today announced that Ted Lasso and AFC Richmond are joining the FIFA 23 roster of teams. Lasso is joined on the sidelines by Coach Beard, with the pitch being populated by some of the team's biggest stars like Jamie Tartt, Roy Kent, Dani Rojas, Sam Obisanya, and Isaac McAdoo. While the actors' likenesses are included in the product, EA Sports hasn't indicated if we'll be hearing Jamie Tartt and Roy Kent's signature crowd chants (though it seems doubtful, seeing as how Roy Kent's chant would probably bump the ESRB rating up to M for Mature).
Regardless of that fact, you can play matches at AFC Richmond's home ground, Nelson Road, and even take control of Coach Lasso or AFC Richmond through Career Mode. AFC Richmond is also playable in Kick-Off, Online Friendlies, and Online Seasons. FIFA 23 Ultimate Team is also adding several AFC Richmond customization items, including kits, TIFOs, and the option to select Ted Lasso or Coach Beard as your FUT club's manager. All the AFC Richmond content in FUT will be obtainable through objectives and challenges.
You can see Ted Lasso and the AFC Richmond squad in action through the trailer below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Manage the comedy series' team your way
This is a bit different from the usual news of a club signing on for FIFA. Electronic Arts confirms that Ted Lasso, of the series Ted Lasso, and the AFC Richmond squad are joining the roster of FIFA 23.
Jason Sudeikis' portrayal of lovable coach Ted Lasso will appear in-game, as well as a host of others from the AFC Richmond crew. Coach Beard, Jamie Tartt, Dani Rojas, Sam Obisanya, Roy Kent, and Isaac McAdoo are all lined up. Their home field of Nelson Road is also being integrated into FIFA 23.
And honestly, they all look solid in motion. Check it out in the trailer below.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUamiLX6gp4
According to the EA blog about the news, Ted will be selectable as a playable manager in Career Mode. You can also opt to manage AFC Richmond, swapping them into the Premier League or other playable Career Mode leagues.
AFC Richmond will also be playable in other modes, like Kick-Off, Online Friendlies, and Online Seasons, with the Nelson Road stadium available.
Kits and TIFOs for AFC Richmond are also being incorporated into Ultimate Team, as well as the option to have Ted or Coach Beard as your club manager. All AFC Richmond content in the FUT mode will be available through objectives and challenges.
Barbeque sauce
If you're not familiar, Ted Lasso is a series on Apple+ based on an NBC shorts series. Ted is an American football coach who moves to England to take up the head coaching job for a Premier League team, and while it's definitely a comedy, it's also pretty heartfelt and enjoyable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7EIiohs6U
So it's definitely rad to see the whole AFC crew in here, and yeah, I'm actually kind of into the idea of playing a season as Ted and AFC. That chance isn't far off either. FIFA 23 goes live on September 30 for PlayStation, Xbox, PC, and Stadia.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a sucker for invention when it comes to story in video games, and Beacon Pines drew me in with what looked like a choice-driven adventure. As you explore the down-on-its-luck farming town of the title, you discover 'charms'. Each charm is a word which can be deployed at set points to branch the story in new, severe ways. More importantly, you can flip back and forth between these pivotal moments at any time, allowing you to deploy new words in earlier chapters to see what happens.

Except, Beacon Pines is far less choice-driven than I expected. Instead, it's something far rarer and more ambitious in video games: it is a good story, well written, with strong characters you grow to care for.

When Gun Interactive revealed The Texas Chain Saw Massacre last year, I was underwhelmed by its short teaser but excited about its potential. It’s one of my favorite horror movie franchises, partly because of how much it still scares me – every good haunted house has a Leatherface at the end that chases you out to the exit, right? – but also because of its backdrop: Texas. Horror, be it movies or games, typically draws attention to dreary atmospheres, spooky ambiance, perhaps some bad weather, and nighttime. The Texas Chain Saw Massacre bucked that trend in the 1970s. After going …]]></summary>

Both first-person score attack shooters are dressed in similar beautiful cloaks of skulls and gurgling industrial soundscapes, but while Devil Daggers nudges you into cautious survival, Hyper Demon shoves you into aggression. In Hyper Demon, a long and cautious run will likely score lower than a short burst of ultraviolence. What glorious ultraviolence it is!
When I first saw Hyper Demon's trailer, I felt excitement, wonder, and fear. Here's the important thing to realise: the unearthly and incomprehensible violence you see in that trailer is genuinely what the game looks like to play. That's how it feels to play, too.

Nope - the game wasn't what I expected at all. At least, not the 45-minute portion I got to play. Rather, my demo was more of a hardcore puzzler with some exploration elements and the teeniest smattering of action. Don't get me wrong, it was still unsettling and grotesque! Just in more of a brain-training way, if the brain-training was for MIT graduates, or like, the human calculators on University Challenge.

Whether you're talking about the two well-received films, the fun Sonic Boom animated series, or the long-running and beloved comic series, people who enjoy the Sonic the Hedgehog video games have had plenty of other avenues to expand their fandom.

Today, Netflix and Sega released a teaser trailer giving us a taste of the action. It doesn't show much, but if the 40 seconds of action are any indication, it's bringing plenty of style and fun (as well as several classic characters). You can check out the trailer in the header above.

Both GPUs are based on Nvidia’s new Ada Lovelace architecture, and will launch this year: the RTX 4090 on October 12th, and the RTX 4080 sometime in November. 


Key features of Ada Lovelace, and thus these new cards, include 3rd Gen RT cores, 4th Gen Tensor cores, and a new streaming multiprocessor. These supposedly add up to twice the performance of Ampere (that’s the RTX 30 series architecture currently dominating our best graphics card guide) in standard rasterised games, and up to four times the performance in ray traced games. And since Nvidia were clearly in a ray-tracey mood, they also took the opportunity to reveal Portal RTX: a semi-official mod for the original Portal that upgrades it with RT lighting and reflection effects. Corrrr.

Except the game didn’t seem to be following the naming convention of its predecessor Yakuza: Like A Dragon, instead ditching the part associated with the Japanese crime syndicate.

Suffice to say, there won’t be an EVGA version of the RTX 4090 or any RTX 40 series GPU that might be announced during Nvidia’s GeForce Beyond event later today.

Uber say they’re in contact with both the FBI and the U.S. Department Of Justice over the hacks.

And it is that. But I wasn't expecting it to contain a gentle rumination on getting old and figuring out what things are really worth caring about.

Ergo, it's not a massive surprise to see the Nvidia RTX 3090 Ti, Team Green's flagship card, down to just $999 at Amazon after debuting at twice that figure.

The 80-some clips seemingly show everything from full, in-game scenarios to clearly unfinished bits of grey boxing, but you won't find a link to them here, because the truth is, they're simply not worth looking at. What possible benefit could they provide anyone right here, right now? The leaker gets their five minutes of fame and an influx of new followers, sure. But GTA 6 itself isn't going to look anything like what you see in those clips when it's actually finished, so someone please tell me, what is even the point?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Castle Dimitrescu was one of the many highlights of Resident Evil Village, so it makes sense that Capcom are returning to it in the game's upcoming DLC adventure, Shadows Of Rose. Set 16 years after the events of Village, this story expansion centres on Rose, the daughter of Village protagonist Ethan Winters, as she comes to terms with her emerging mold powers. She was just a teeny, tiny baby when her dad was fighting off the very tall vampire lady in the base game, but now she's all grown up and wants to be rid of the supernatural spore abilities that have been plaguing her family ever since the events of Resident Evil 7. 
It's not yet clear what role Lady D's castle has to play in Rose's journey, but man, it sure is nice to be back roaming its ornate hallways again. Or rather it would be, if it weren't for all the ashen mold men stalking its corridors, and its rather gross (but strangely hypnotic) rivers of undulating strawberry jam gore that have been plastered all over the walls, floor and ceiling. Ach, now it's on my shoes. Great. And the gate's locked behind me. Fantastic. I knew coming back here would be a bad idea…

NBA 2K23, the latest in Visual Concepts’ long-running, annualized basketball series, introduces multiple new features and revamped game mechanics while taking us on a stroll down memory lane. Though the 2K franchise has garnered a reputation for focusing more on microtransactions than actual gameplay innovation, this year’s game mode additions and foundational improvements mostly overshadow the notorious pay-to-win schemes. The result is a package that feels more novel than other titles in the …]]></summary>

The G29 set works with PC, PS4 and PS5, making it a good pickup for anyone with at least one of these systems that likes to play titles like Gran Turismo 7 or F1 22. There's also an Xbox Series, Xbox One and PC model, the G920, that's available at the same discounted price and of course will work well for games like Forza Horizon 5, F1 22 and the upcoming Forza Motorsport scheduled to arrive early next year.

There, you can find a 32GB kit of DDR5-5600 CL36 memory for $150, reduced from its normal price of $180. That's more expensive than 32GB of DDR4, but you're getting a substantial increase in bandwidth and reduction in latency compared to the DDR5-4800 CL40 JEDEC standard.

Although Capcom just pulled the curtain back on the next batch of fighters to join the roster, my demo included the first playable sessions for the last trio of reveals: Guile, Juri, and newcomer Kimberly. Since Kimberly was the wildcard of that bunch, I opted to spend most of my hands-on time discovering what she brings to the table. After only a few rounds, I had a tough time wanting to switch to anyone else.
If you haven’t been keeping up, Kimberly is a ninja pupil of Guy who adores the ‘80s and graffiti. She incorporates the latter interest into her acrobatic offense, such as throwing exploding spray cans like they’re shurikens. That’s silly and fantastic.

The Pokémon franchise has been more prolific than usual as of late, with multiple releases over the past year and another big entry coming soon. However, those without a Switch or looking for a suitable monster-battling alternative should focus on Temtem, which has emerged from years of early-access development. While borrowing heavily from the formula of Nintendo’s massive franchise, its world is fun to explore, and collecting and learning all about the titular Temtems is satisfying. Although the core adventure is a smi…]]></summary>

Then I played Trail Out, a chaotic crash-and-ram racing game with, for some reason, a story mode about a former stunt driver who is very much some guy. I'm still not sure if he's talking to himself, through the fourth wall, or to his dog. His best friend wears a gas mask and lifts weights in the junkyard without breaking eye contact.
The racing is very solid, but more importantly it has character. Odd, odd character.

See, the Steam Deck booth at TGS, from the towering scale model to the weirdly impressive elegance of its logistics, might be the finest event booth I’ve ever seen.

Given the latter game’s events and the tantalizing trailer for its second part, Rebirth, it had me thinking that it may be a good time to dust off my copy of 2008’s Crisis Core. Square Enix read my mind by announcing a remaster of Zack Fair’s PSP adventure, christening it with the subtitle “Reunion,” giving newcomers the answer to the question of “who the heck was that black-haired fella in Remake?” As for me, I thought I had a good reason to return to the game. After playing a decent chunk of Reunion at Tokyo Game Show, I’m all good. 
My expectations were always reasonable. Reunion is a remaster, not a remake the scale of, well, Remake. That means that feature-wise, the best way to sum it up is “That PSP game? You can pl…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let me fill you in on a little secret most people won't tell you: the real way to enjoy a video game show is at home, comfortably on your couch, watching the event on YouTube. 
Over the years, the game press has done a remarkable job tricking you into thinking otherwise. The shows look extravagant, energetic, and almost like we're getting glimpses into the future, which we then curate into bite-sized news stories and on-demand trailers for our faithful readers back home. 
The reality is much more depressing.
Whether it's E3, PAX, Gamescom, or in this case, Tokyo Game Show, going to a video game trade event means dealing with the near-lethal combination of jetlag and overwork. The brutal FOMO of being in some of the coolest cities in the world but spending all your time in convention halls. The unbelievable cacophony of thousands of people talking at once. The unbelievable smells of thousands of people all standing too close to each other. The never-ending lines of thousands of people all needing to use the toilet at the same time. This doesn't even touch on the unavoidable safety concerns of having a video game conference in the midst of an ongoing pandemic. But I digress.
All that said, there's some fun stuff to look at, like big, gaudy statues and giant booths that likely cost tens of thousands of dollars for games you've never heard of and likely will never play. Stuff that really makes it all worth it. 
While we'd love to fly each and every one of you out to Tokyo, sadly, we only had the budget to fly out two of our full-time employees. So in lieu of attending yourself, please enjoy my curated batch of pictures of what I saw on the show floor. 
Well, there you have it, folks. All the fun of TGS without actually being there. See you next year!]]></summary>

The official Nvidia GeForce Twitter account has been vagueposting about something called #ProjectBeyond, starting with a coded image on September 8th and more recently listing a date and time: 8am PDT (4pm BST) on September 20th.
Given it’s about time in Nvidia’s preferred biannual cycle for a new graphics card generation, and it being the GeForce account rather than one of Nvidia’s non-gaming brands, and Nvidia also dropping the cryptic stuff and just straight-up confirming a "GeForce Beyond" show on the 20th, you can bet your sweet memory bus that September 20th will see some kind of RTX GPU announcement. The RTX 30 series, which has contributed most of the past two years’ best graphics cards, will finally begin its journey into semi-retirement.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yesterday at the Tokyo Games Show, Capcom formally announced the addition of Ken, Blanka, E.Honda and Dhalsim to the Street Fighter 6 roster. Technically, none of this should come as a surprise. Not only are they all Street Fighter faithfuls, but pretty much the entire cast list got leaked back in June thanks to some rogue character art. One thing that has been pleasantly surprising, however, is learning that Ken, pictured in that leaked document as looking rather dishevelled and rocking a bit of a 'sad, middle-aged dad' look, is anything but.
Indeed, when I went to play the latest build of Street Fighter 6 at Capcom's UK offices earlier in the week, Ken was absolutely killing it. Rather than suffering from a mid-life crisis, Ken was hauling it across the screen like an absolute battering ram, clearly full of the same mad protein shakes his mate Ryu's been hawking down since their last SF outing, as both of them have gone full-on Redfield Beefcake this time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Konami has revealed Suikoden I & II HD Remaster Gate Rune and Dunan Unification Wars, a remaster of the first two classic Suikoden JRPGs, and the two will be released as a single package sometime next year on consoles and PC. 
More specifically, these two remasters will be packaged into the same collection and this remastered duo is due out on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC (via Steam) in 2023. The first Suikoden was released in 1995, and its sequel, Suikoden II, was released in 1998. Check out what the remastered versions of these classic games look like in the announcement trailer below: 


As you can see, these remasters are looking excellent, especially in the way that the original look and feel of the sprite imagery remains intact. Here's hoping they feel as great to play as they did back in the day. 
Here are some highlights of this remastered collection from the game's Steam page:

Your adventure unfolds by making decisions using cards which represent allies, resources, and events, which often have weird and surprising consequences. Weirdly, the game it most reminds me of is Townscaper: throw pieces together, uncertain what will happen, then be surprised and delighted what the system produces. Like accidentally making your cowboy confess his love for his horse, leading to a fresh new baby horse card in your hand. Oh no.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve always thought each of the sixteen colossi in Shadow Of The Colossus is kinda cute in their own special way. There’s just something about the animal-like antics of those immense, lumbering creatures that make them naturally adorable, even though they wouldn’t hesitate in breaking every single bone in my small, weak body.
Zürich-based developers Stray Fawn Studio totally get what I’m on about, and have created their own lovable rocky giant in their city-building sim The Wandering Village. Their creature, Onbu, is a colossal six-legged beast, and the walking platform on which your village sits, a plateau of flat land mass on its back making for an excellent settlement ground. Onbu is best described as a gentle giant. They move slowly but carefully, love to munch on fields of wild mushrooms, nap in meadows of soft pink flowers, and tuck in their paws and tail when sleeping.

During today's Call of Duty: Next livestream, Activision revealed a ton of new information surrounding the next phase of Call of Duty, which kicks off this fall. It begins on October 28 with Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II, the next mainline entry in the franchise, but perhaps culminates on November 16, when Call of Duty: Warzone 2.0 lanches free for everyone. Today brought us a look at what to expect when those experiences arrive later this year, as well as a glimpse at a mobile version of Warzone coming next year.

Integrating numbers from HowLongToBeat, most Game Pass games' pages now suggests how long a game is in several playstyles: finishing the main story; doing the main story and optional extras; and absolutely 100%ing everything. While I usually find talk of game length is tied into awful opinions that longer is better, I think this is great info to know on Game Pass.

The 5000X normally costs quite a bit - the RRP is £220 and even discounts drop it to £155+ - but today it's down to £116.66 when you buy from Box via Amazon.
That could be a misprice, given the vast price discrepancy between the RRP and sale price. With only two units available you'll have to move fast to pick this one up...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week on the Electronic Wireless Show podcast we, prompted by friendly listener OurSuperior, talk about the best changes of eras in games. As you can imagine, this is an easier task for Nate than it is to me, because many of his favourite games are predicated around era changes. Thus I find myself in the position of arguing semantics. How the turn tables have turned.
I'm able to win Nate around on at least one of my desperate bids to classify things that aren't eras as eras, although he does promptly shut me down on the most ridiculous one. It may surprise you to know that we don't actually talk about too many history games (although time travel comes up a lot). And stick around for a thrilling Cavern Of Lies. Will the Red Baron (me) be shot down at last?

        <updated>2022-09-15T13:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hand Of Fate was such a singular thing. On the one hand, it was a tabletop deckbuilding game that saw you picking through roguelike-style dungeons by choosing different cards dealt out by its mysterious Dealer. On the other, it was also an action-packed hack and slasher, bringing its fantastical fight sections to life in fully 3D combat arenas - and there hasn't been anything quite like it since. Voice Of Cards certainly had a go, but its tedious battle system landed it straight on its own discard pile. Thankfully, we've now got the infinitely more engaging Foretales, a new narrative card game from French developers Alkemi, and it comes pretty damn close to capturing that Hand Of Fate goodness. 
It doesn't ever venture into the realms of 3D admittedly, erring more toward the Inscryption school of tabletop combat encounters, but it does nail the delivery of telling an artful, swashbuckling adventure through cards and cards alone. And much like Hand Of Fate, this isn't a one and done affair, either, as there are multiple paths to take through this entertaining fantasy yarn, and several game-changing decisions you'll have to make as you try and avert a string of terrible visions threatening to destroy its anthropomorphic animal world. You won't succeed at preventing them all during a single playthrough, but its hard choices only make its overarching story that much more gripping.

        <updated>2022-09-15T13:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Saturnalia is an upcoming survival horror game with an extremely unique art style announced last month. Now, we know when we can play it because Saturnalia has captured an October 27 release date. 
That's when it will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC (via the Epic Games Store). Developed by Italy-based studio Santa Ragione, the team behind games like Fotonica, MirrorMoon EP, and Wheels of Aurelia, Saturnalia is shaping up to be a great time. You can find out why in the New Gameplay Today segment we recorded that's all about Saturnalia, featuring more than 15 minutes of gameplay, below: 


"[Saturnalia] is a kaleidoscopic adventure inspired in equal parts by authentic Sardinian folklore and classic Italian Giallo horror films," a press release reads. "The story involves a mysterious, centuries-old ritual that occurs every year on the night of the winter solstice in the Italian village of Gravoi. Each of the game's four playable characters must utilize their unique abilities and confront their own personal revelations in order to expose the secrets haunting the town and ultimately escape their doom."
Here are some additional Saturnalia highlights from Santa Ragione: 
Seek clues in a maze-like village with no markers or compass to guide your steps.
Explore the ever-changing town of Gravoi using matches to keep the dark at bay.
Flight and stealth are your only options, as you cannot fight the creature that hunts you.
Immerse yourself in the stop-motion animation and vibrant expressionist art style of Saturnalia for an eerily beautiful atmosphere that is as enthralling as it is chilling.
Control your fate through non-linear progression and a dynamic, adaptive narrative, with unique endgames dependent on player choices.


Saturnalia hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC via the Epic Games Store on October 27.

Before we dive too far into this thing: if you’re here because you’ve got a kid and you just want to know if Disney Dreamlight Valley will make them happy, and that the rat from Ratatouille doesn’t say the f-word, and that at no point does Ariel drag herself onto the beach to try to recruit them into a multi-level marketing scam, then you’re golden. Disney Dreamlight Valley is a top-marks Animal Crossing rip-off that will make fans of too-big mice irreversibly giddy. Your children may eventually need a special operation to stop them smiling.

She wields kunai, teleports through walls to allies, burst heals teammates with talismans, and can make nearby allies briefly invulnerable with her Protection Suzu move. Oh, and her ultimate summons a fox spirit who rushes ahead and buffs friendlies that follow behind. 
Kiriko will be free for all Overwatch 1 players, or you can earn her by reaching Tier 55 on the battle pass' free track. Of course, you will instantly unlock the character alongside newcomers Sojourn and Junker Queen by purchasing the premium battle pass. Not only is Kiriko the first support capable of keeping up with fast characters like Tracer and Genji, but the development team informed us her healing output should be similar to Moira and Mercy. 


Kiriko's Abilities In Overwatch 2
Protection Suzu – Upon impact, allies in the area become briefly invulnerable and are cleansed of most negative effects.
Kunai – Thrown projectile that deals increased critical damage.
Swift Step – Teleport directly to an ally, even through walls.
Healing Ofuda – Channel a burst of healing talismans that can seek targeted allies.
Kitsune Rush – Summon a fox spirit that rushes forward, accelerating the movement, attack speed, and cooldowns of allies that follow its path.
Wall Climb – Jump at walls to climb up them. 
Season 1 of Overwatch 2 releases for free on October 4 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.]]></summary>

September 29th is the date you’ll want to mark in your runic calendars, which I assume are constructed out of some variety of standing stone formation. The date was announced during last night’s ID@Xbox stream.

It feature more Sonic Frontiers gameplay, which consists of the blue blur climbing colossal machines as if they're mountains, but when he reaches the top of one, he stumbles upon something very special: a Chaos Emerald. As any Sonic fan likely knows, collecting all of these will help the hedgehog transform into Super Sonic, a Saiyan-like version of the character that's faster and stronger. And sure enough, that's exactly what happens in this new TGS Sonic Frontiers trailer. 
Check it out for yourself below: 


As you can see, this is the first appearance of Super Sonic in Sonic Frontiers' marketing thus far. It's also the first confirmation that Super Sonic is in the game. This trailer is another exciting Sonic Frontiers trailer showcasing more of what we can expect when the game hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on November 8.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio has announced that its Yakuza-adjacent Judgment series will make its way to Steam for the first time. The best news: they're out on Steam today.
Judgment and Lost Judgment come to Steam on September 14. This marks the first appearance of each game on PC (though Judgment has been available to stream on PC via Stadia). 
This news is especially significant given that RGG Studio originally planned to release Lost Judgment on PC when it launched last year. However, that version was nixed when the talent agency representing actor Takuya Kimura, who portrays protagonist Takayuki Yagami, enforced strict policies about allowing Kimura’s likeness on PC. Both parties' inability to agree threatened Judgment’s future as a franchise since RGG Studio has pushed for more of its titles to come to Steam; every mainline Yakuza game is available on the storefront, for example. It would appear those issues have been ironed out, which bodes well for the potential of a third game. 
The Judgment games are noir action thrillers that adhere to the same open-world design template as the Yakuza series. Though the plots largely unfold in Kamurocho, the series stars a new cast of characters and emphasizes investigative gameplay. Players control Yagami, a disgraced lawyer and private detective who works to unravel a pair of conspiracy plots. In Yakuza fashion, he also has his hands full helping his colorful clients and random citizens solve more light-hearted – or comically absurd – problems.

That reveal trailer looked great, but it was short and sweet. 
Now, RGG has released a new "Ambush" trailer that showcases more than five minutes of Like A Dragon: Ishin, giving us a better look at this upcoming Yakuza spinoff. Like A Dragon: Ishin was first released on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 3 in 2014, but it never came out in the West. This new release rebuilds Like A Dragon: Ishin from the ground up, and you can check out how great it's looking in the trailer below: 


Like A Dragon: Ishin takes place in the Late Edo Period of Japan, in the 1860s. After completing his special sword training, Sakamoto Ryoma returns to his home in Tosa, only to find conflict against a prestigious samurai. You can read more about it in our story here.

Now, RGG has announced Like A Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name, a new Yakuza game that will follow Kiryu's life following the events of Yakuza 6: The Song of Life leading up to Like A Dragon 8. 
In the reveal trailer, which aired today during the RGG Summit 2022 showcase, we see Kiryu at a monastery. Having left behind his former Yakuza life, as well as his name, Kiryu, who now goes by Joryu, is trying to live the life of a monk. However, he's seemingly pulled into one more job – an escort mission – and if today's Like A Dragon 8 trailer is any indication, it seems this final job pulls him back into the life he had put behind him. 
Check it out for yourself in the reveal trailer below:


As you can see, The Man Who Erased His Name is shaping up to be a treat for longtime Yakuza fans and it seems like necessary playing in the leadup to 2024's Like A Dragon 8. Like A Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC in 2023.

In this playthrough, I am frequently distracted by them. Even though this version is essentially the same game, it takes on new life through PSVR2’s stunning display.
The headset’s OLED display delivers a wide 110-degree field of view capable of presenting games in vivid 4K HDR. Unlike most VR headsets on the market, I’m not seeing any general pixelization, artifacting, or graininess in the text – everything looks sharp. The display resolution is 2000x2040 per eye, and the games can run at smooth framerat…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The eighth mainline installment in the popular and long-running Yakuza franchise has been revealed and it's called Like A Dragon 8. 
Set up as a direct sequel to 2020's Yakuza: Like A Dragon, which starred a new protagonist, Ichiban Kasuga, and turn-based RPG mechanics rather than brawler combat, it was a hit amongst fans. That's why it's no surprise Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio is following it up with another Like A Dragon game. Check out the Like A Dragon 8 reveal trailer for yourself below:


As you can see, the former protagonist of Yakuza, Kazuma Kiryu, is back. He was the protagonist in the first six Yakuza games, and now he's back in Like A Dragon 8. Ichiban tells Kiryu it's Hero time – remember, he's a big fan of the Dragon Quest series which stars plenty of heroes – before the trailer cuts to both of their faces, revealing that some time has passed, with both characters looking at least a little older than when we last saw them. 
Like A Dragon 8 is due out PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PC sometime in 2024. 
In the meantime, read about Like A Dragon: Ishin, a Yakuza spinoff first released on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 3 in 2014 finally making its way to the West, rebuilt from the ground up, next year.]]></summary>

Our day kicked off with a Nintendo Direct, which brought us more than 40 minutes of headlines, gameplay trailers, announcements, and even name reveals. We finished off the day with a PlayStation State of Play, giving us trailers and information for the PlayStation family of consoles, including PlayStation VR2.
Now that the dust has settled a little bit, we want to know what caught your eye. Was it something from Nintendo's digital event? Perhaps the name and release date reveal of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom? Was the impressive list of Nintendo 64 games coming to Switch Online's Expansion Pack? Maybe you're super hyped for Fire Emblem Engage?
Or was it something from the PlayStation State of Play event? Tekken 8 was an expected but exciting reveal, while games like Rise of the Ronin and Like a Dragon: Ishin look like an absolute blast. Of course, we can't talk about the State of Play stream without mentioning that God of War: Ragnarök footage.
Let us know in the comments below what you're most hyped about coming out of today's Nintendo Direct and PlayStation State of Play. If you happened to miss any of the announcements, you can check out our news hub for all our coverage from today.]]></summary>

        <updated>2022-09-13T23:50:09.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony revealed a brand new story trailer for God Of War Ragnarök during today’s State Of Play stream. The video showcased otherworldly imagery, including astral jellyfish, giant dinosaur-like creatures, and notably, a pivotal scene wherein Atreus appears to usher in Fimbulwinter, the end of the world, alongside Sköll and Hati – two wolves that are the offspring of Fenrir. According to Norse mythology, Sköll and Hati are two wolves who exist to one day spark the beginning of Ragnarök by chasing and devouring the sun and the moon. It’s pretty clear that’s what is happening in this new trailer, but why is Atreus helping them?
Additionally, it seems Atreus is hiding critical information from his father, Kratos, so why is Kratos following orders from his teenage son? Why is Freya holding a sword up to Atreus’ throat in the trailer? Is she holding Atreus hostage or trying to show Kratos the same pain she suffered after her son Baldur was killed in the first game? The trailer creates more questions than answers, precisely what I want from pre-launch marketing. 


We’ll have to wait to find the answers to these questions when God Of War Ragnarök releases on November 8. In the meantime, let me know your story theories in the comments below!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlayStation and Team Ninja have announced Rise of the Ronin, a new action game coming exclusively to PlayStation 5 sometime in 2024. 
It was revealed during today's PlayStation State of Play, and if you're at all familiar with Team Ninja's other games, you're probably going to be into this one. It's not quite clear if it's taking up the Soulslike mantle that other Team Ninja games have (looking at you, Nioh), but there were a few gameplay sequences that showed some combat similar to From Software's hit series. 
Check it out for yourself in the reveal trailer below: 


As you can see, Rise of the Ronin looks quite interesting. The combat looks fast, brutal, and explosive, and the characters look fun. The world looks especially unique, too, with some of the game seemingly taking place in more rural areas of Japan and others taking place in more dense villages and towns.

Unfortunately, it might be a while before we learn more because Rise of the Ronin won't hit PlayStation 5 until 2024.

Tekken 8 was revealed in a new cinematic trailer that aired during today's PlayStation State of Play. It began with a few shots to set up the scenery before cutting to two series mainstays, Kazuya and Kazuya's son, Jin. The two duke it out in what appears to be a fair fight, that is until Kazuya calls forth the power of the devil gene inside him to finish the fight. 
Check it out for yourself in the reveal trailer below:


Unfortunately, this trailer doesn't reveal much else. Tekken 8 looks very much like Tekken, which is great. The trailer also doesn't reveal a release date – it just says to stay tuned for more information.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As one of the most influential and beloved shooters of all time, GoldenEye 007 is a special game for many who played it in the late '90s. However, it's been a long time since the game has been playable on modern consoles. That changes soon, as the revolutionary first-person shooter received a duo of announcements today. First, we learned about a Switch version as part of the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack N64 catalog. However, we also learned the title (which was developed by now-Microsoft-owned Rare), is also coming to Xbox as a part of Game Pass and Rare Replay.
When the game arrives on Xbox, it will include the classic campaign, complete with the original difficulty settings and cheat codes (no word on if "DK Mode" will be renamed to something more generic like "Big Head Mode" for the Xbox version). The Xbox version will also include the split-screen local competitive multiplayer mode that made the game such a mainstay for get-togethers in the N64 era.


Unfortunately, it does not appear as though the online multiplayer available in the Nintendo Switch Online version will make the jump to the Xbox version. However, the Xbox version of GoldenEye 007 does include improved control options (including dual analog stick support), native 16:9 resolution up to 4K Ultra HD, a consistent refresh rate, and full achievement support. 
GoldenEye 007 is coming to Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One as part of Game Pass. Everyone who already owns Rare Replay will also be able to download the game at no additional cost. We don't know exactly when GoldenEye 007 arrives on Xbox, but according to Rare, the game will land simultaneously on Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch Online.]]></summary>

For nearly 30 years, I looked forward to each workday, eager to see what game news would break, what I would be writing about, and on the best days, what I would be playing. In the time it took to create 330 monthly magazines, I was privileged to work alongside some of the most talented and amazing people I've ever met. For a kid who couldn’t get enough of video games growing up, I was living a dream. I knew how lucky I was and never took it for granted. I worked hard. I wanted Game Informer to be the place to go to celebrate games. I think we accomplished that tenfold and have created an outlet unlike any other.
In the weeks ahead, I’ll transition from writing game news to creating it. I’m entering the world of game dev…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We're rapidly approaching the midway point for Mario Kart 8 Deluxe's Booster Course Pass content. With two of the six promised waves of new courses already out, Nintendo has begun teasing what players can expect with the third wave, which is due out this holiday season. During today's Nintendo Direct, we learned the first two courses coming in the third eight-course wave of new tracks.
Fittingly, the first course we learned about for Wave 3 of the Booster Course Pass is Merry Mountain. This holiday-themed track first made its debut in Mario Kart Tour in 2020 as part of the Winter Tour. Meanwhile, for those looking for something not holiday-themed, Nintendo is also bringing Peach Gardens, a track that first appeared in Mario Kart DS in 2005.
Wave 1 brought fan favorites like Coconut Mall (Wii), Choco Mountain (N64), and Sky Garden (GBA), while Wave 2 gave us access to tracks like Kalimari Desert (N64), Mario Circuit 3 (SNES), and Mushroom Gorge (Wii). Each wave has also given us two tracks from Mario Kart Tour, with Wave 2 also including an all-new course in Sky-High Sundae. 
Mario Kart 8 Deluxe – Booster Course Pass Wave 3 is scheduled to arrive this holiday season.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the lead-up to Nintendo Switch Sports, Nintendo promised two major free updates following the launch. The first free update, which came out earlier this summer, added the ability to use the leg strap accessory for entire soccer matches instead of just shootouts. The second, more anticipated free update is set to add a new playable sport to the package: golf. Originally set for release this fall, Nintendo today announced a small delay to the update, saying it now arrives this holiday season.
The Nintendo Switch Sports version of golf lets you tee up across 21 holes carried over from the Wii Sports series. You can play locally with other players or hit the links with up to eight players online in the new Survival Golf mode. In Survival Golf, whoever takes the most strokes each round is eliminated.
This free update to Nintendo Switch Sports arrives this holiday season. For more about Nintendo Switch Sports, you can check out our full review here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dauntless developer Phoneix Labs has announced a new title that, needless to say, is dramatically different than its monster-slaying RPG. Fae Farm is a cozy life simulation that whisks players to a world of magic and wonder where you'll flex your green thumb as a farming savior. 


As the name suggests, the bulk of the experience involves running a farm as an adventurer and newcomer to a community in the land of Azoria. Though you’ll work to bring peace to this troubled land, you’ll also kick back and leisurely explore various environments, collect resources, and build homesteads. Fae Farm is built with cooperation in mind. The title features drop-in/drop-out co-op, both locally and online, allowing players to farm and quest together. 
“With Fae Farm we wanted to take our favorite elements of the sim genres we love, infuse them with magic and beautiful art, and wrap everything in a light-hearted cooperative experience,” said creative director Katie De Sousa in a press release. “I can’t wait to see what kind of cozy homesteads players build in Azoria.”
Fae Farm is slated to release during Q2 2023 exclusively for Switch.]]></summary>

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2022/09/13/pikmin-4-is-real-and-its-out-next-year"/>
        <updated>2022-09-13T14:31:11.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I can't believe I'm writing this: Pikmin 4 is real, and it's out next year. 
Let's get right to it – check out the official Pikmin 4 announcement trailer below: 


Here's what Nintendo had to say about Pikmin 4 in a press release following today's reveal: 
 
Pikmin franchise revealed a tranquil park and a napping Bulborb, but it was still missing one important element … Pikmin! Where could they be? More details about this new title for Nintendo Switch will be revealed ahead of its 2023 launch."

 
Pikmin is a very special franchise to many people, but despite its niche popularity, it's never quite reached the heights of other Nintendo franchises. In total, the franchise has sold more than 8 million copies. Pikmin 3 Deluxe on Switch proved the franchise still had some (fruit) juice in it by selling roughly 2 million units in less than a year – a quarter of the series' entire sales – and fans speculated this had proved to Nintendo that it was time for a proper sequel. 
Pikmin 4 was mentioned by series creator Shigeru Miyamoto back in 2015 when he told Eurogamer that it was in development and "very close to completion." Time passed and then Hey! Pikmin, a 2D Pikmin spinoff, was announced and then released in July of 2017. Some speculated that this was the Pikmin 4 Miyamoto was referring to back in 2015 but in June of that year, Miyamoto told Eurogamer that "it is progressing," seemingly confirming that he did not view Hey! Pikmin as the fourth sequel. Unfortunately, that was the last Nintendo or anyone there referred to Pikmin 4...until today's Nintendo Direct!

Nintendo showcased a short and sweet teaser trailer that gave us more of the luscious world of Pikmin before flashing to a title screen that revealed Pikmin 4 is coming to Switch next year. As for exactly when, that remains unknown  – Nintendo simply stated 2023. But hey, that's better than wondering when, if ever, Pikmin 4 would actually come out!

The soundtrack includes favorites like "One Winged Angel," "Torn from the Heavens," "Suteki Da Ne," and plenty more.

The game can be enjoyed by two players locally or four players online.


Theatrhythm Final Bar Line comes to PlayStation 4 and Switch on February 16. Square Enix also announced that players can look forward to paid DLC from the Saga, Nier, Octopath Traveler, and Live A Live series for a total of 90 additional songs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On November 4, Hazelight and Electronic Arts' It Takes Two launches on Switch. This heartwarming adventure originally released in 2021 on PC and PlayStation and Xbox consoles. It received a 9.25 out of 10 review from Game Informer and also won The Game Awards' 2021's Game of the Year honors.
It Takes Two can only be played cooperatively and can either be played on a single Switch via splitscreen or on two Switches via local wireless or online via the free friend's pass.
In my review of the Xbox One version, I said "It Takes Two may not be the platforming juggernaut that it aspires to be, but it more than makes up for it with its big heart, wealth in variety, and gorgeous imagery. All of its individual actions are things we’ve done in other games, but when applied to this distinct cooperative approach, they take on a whole new life and are used in wonderful ways over a long adventure. The action will have you laughing and screaming at your TV, and the story stays strong throughout, creating the backbone for an entertaining adventure that roars with excitement and should keep you glued to the controller to see if this couple’s lost love can be rekindled."
Preoders for the Switch version begin today.]]></summary>
