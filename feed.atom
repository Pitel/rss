        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The situation: Sumo Newcastle are making a dystopian on-foot multiplayer racing game called Deathsprint 66, in which you control one of eight Running Men hurtling through the spiked and bladed contours of a futuristic megacity. The complication: competing against other actual human beings isn't always pleasant or desirable, especially when hurtling through the spiked and bladed contours of a futuristic megacity. The solution: Deathsprint 66 is getting a set of PvE-focussed "Episodes" in which just one human player plus optional bots hurtle through the spiked and bladed contours of a futuristic megacity.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Grenaa Games has announced that Fabledom, a casual city-builder set in a magical fantasy world, will arrive on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and Nintendo Switch on September 12, 2024. While its full release has been available on PC since May 13, you can now enjoy this relaxing from the comforts of your couch, bed, or anywhere else you game from.


Fabledom is a city-builder game that, although it still has resource management and villager satisfaction as key features, focuses more on the casual side of the genre. You still have to watch your income and available resources, but these normally stressful features are dialed down slightly to help you focus on the more cozy side of things. Along the way, you'll watch your villagers grow the town by building various important structures, preparing for winter, and even occasionally finding romance.




When Fabledom 1.0 initially launched on PC, it added numerous new buildings, rulers, and quests, which we expect will also be available on consoles from day one. There are even dragons, which I'm always happy to see regardless of the game or genre. These all make for extra opportunities to experience the relaxing and interesting side of magical fantasy worlds.


Since then, it's also received its final patch, 1.06, which introduced numerous bug fixes, optimizations, and quality-of-life changes. Fabledom's console release will likely get some tweaks to address any issues that surface from the transition, but we likely won't see many new features in the near future.


Fabledom will launch on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and Nintendo Switch on September 12, 2024, for $20.99 or your regional equivalent. It's available for pre-order now, allowing you to prepare for its launch early. Its full PC release is also available through Steam for the same price.

It's an open-world survival game in which players must gather and farm strange plants on planet Earth 300,000 years in our past, the Pleistocene epoch when primal humans and other strange creatures roamed.


Astrobotanica's gameplay focuses on helping protagonist Xel find plants that could thrive on their home planet. This requires you to explore the world, scan and collect plants, then grow them on farms while trying to work out what could and couldn't survive in a hostile alien environment. Xel themselves will also be battling with Earth's air since it's not entirely compatible with their species.

Nightsoul’s Blessing state


All Natlan characters so far can enter a “Nightsoul’s Blessing” state, usually by using their Elemental Skill. This results in a stance change. You can tell when a character is in their Nightsoul’s Blessing state by looking for a colorful, glowing outline, along with some glowing markings on their body.


Nightsoul’s Blessing manifests differently for each character. Kachina hops into Turbo Twirly and rides it around. Mualani summons an inflatable shark and surfs across terrain. Check your character’s Talent information to see what their Nightsoul’s Blessing does.…]]></summary>

When last we heard about the patch for consoles, Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone said the work was very much at the forefront of their mind. Now, a recent post from the developer shows that this is still the case, but the patch is taking so long, it's detracted from working on their next project.




The message on X shows that Barone is more than aware that 1.6 is taking a lot longer than they imagined, admitting it would be a "huge relief" if it was ready today. However, it isn't, though it's still very much being worked on. This also means t…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Switch owners may ask the question, "Heaven or Hell?" soon as a PAX West banner has reportedly leaked a Guilty Gear Strive port early. The event begins this weekend, but the banner was put up earlier than publisher Arc System Works likely wanted. 


Image via Arc System Works


Guilty Gear Strive is likely heading to Switch


In an X post by SoySauceAsian_ that's since been taken down, an image of a Guilty Gear Strive banner advertising a Switch version was published to the internet. It has since been circulating around Reddit and other outlets. The banner says "Nintendo Switch Version" in bold letters, asking PAX West attendees to pre-order the game. 


You would think the developer would let attendees check out the game. Arc System Works, however, doesn't have a booth at the event, according to the exhibitor list on PAX's website. Perhaps Nintendo could be hosting the game as Guilty Gear Strive is a popular title within the fighting game community. Come to think of it, it's strange that Guilty Gear Strive wasn't revealed during the latest Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase.


An official Guilty Gear X page has confirmed over 3 million copies have been sold since the game's launch in June 2021. With this success, the series is also getting an anime adaptation. It makes sense if Arc System Works wants to expand the game's reach to the Nintendo Switch audience. The developer has also previously launched Dragon Ball FighterZ and DNF Duel on the system. 


Our 8.5/10 review called Guilty Gear Strive "a good, solid, very online-capable fighting game with plenty of big swords, charging dolphins, and doctors with questionable credentials to go around." That sounds like a recipe for a great anime fighter.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Getting the Celestial Ribbon is important in Black Myth: Wukong. When you start crafting armor beyond Legendary into Mythic, it’ll be useful. 


The stat boosts in armor and other secondary effects that come from it will make the remainder of your game much easier too. The transition in difficulty from Chapter 4 and onward is steep, so you definitely want to even the playing field.


How to get Celestial Ribbon in Black Myth: Wukong


To get Celestial Ribbons in Black Myth: Wukong, you will start getting them after beating the main final boss of Chapter 4. After that, you’re mostly going to get this from major bosses and chests moving forward until the end of the game. This also includes buying some for Will at a Shrine.


The following bosses after Chapter 4 will drop Celestial Ribbons:



Keeper of Flaming Mountains


Yaksha King


Bishui Golden-Eyed Beast


Supreme Inspector



In Chapter 5, three chests contain this crafting material, so stay vigilant. In Chapter 6, you’ll earn one from buying it at a Shrine store.


In the end, you should end up with ten Celestial Ribbons if you did everything up until the initial credits. 


You can earn two additional ones if you complete the secret ending. This will require you to complete all secret areas from every chapter including the treasure hunter quest.

How to farm Celestial Ribbon in Black Myth: Wukong


You can’t really farm this material. There is only a finite amount of them you can collect on your first run. If you are looking to craft all armor sets for the trophies/achievements or you’re trying to turn everything mythic, you have to go into New Game Plus.


These will be more readily available to you, along with other armor sets of the Mythical rarity. Eventually, you will have enough of these so you can fully complete your game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stepping out of the shadow.
Though Ninja Gaiden occupied the spotlight on the NES back in the day, there was another similar ninja action game called Shadow of the Ninja which proved to be just about as good and featured two-player co-op. Due to publisher issues, a planned Game Boy version was repurposed as a Ninja Gaiden prequel and a sequel was never made, so the original release slowly faded into obscurity while Ryu Hyabusa continued getting more new games.
Not ones to let a good game be completely forgotten, the passionate developers at Tengo Project have brought this classic back for modern players as Shadow of the Ninja - Reborn. Sporting a gorgeous new art style and some additions and tweaks to the core gameplay, this reimagining of the ‘other’ NES ninja platformer offers up a fun and brutal return to basics.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Although Silent Hill is finally back after a lengthy hiatus, the offerings we've had so far have not been wholly well received. The Short Message didn't exactly set the world on fire, and the interactive experience Ascension was a massive disappointment. As such, we're all waiting to see whether Bloober Team's remake of the legendary second game can save the franchise's renewal.


Given that Silent Hill 2 previews suggest the full game is going to be worth the wait, it's tempting to, once again, get excited about the future of this iconic horror series. In anticipation of the upcoming remake – scheduled to release October 8 – I've put together a list of the best Silent Hill games as noted by their Metacritic scores.

This happened almost immediately, with plenty of Starfield players turning their game into a galaxy far, far away. Hundreds of mods can be found that bring the classic Star Wars appeal to Starfield, but what if you could only choose 10? These are the ones we'd choose.

The Mandalorian is a solid start to this list, bringing Din Djarin's armor and jetpack into Starfield.

The opening radio chat between starting squad member Sid and a pal has that telltale charming tinge of overeager cockney. It also contains the words “bloody” and “arse” in quick succession, though thankfully not next to each other. The only piles are the logs Sid’s crouched behind as he prepares to sneak up to a cable car guarded by Nazis. That is the only haemorrhoids allusion I will ever make on this website. Until the next time I have to write about Andrew Wilson.
“Oil just use my trusty knoife” mutters Sid as I take down my first guard. Straight away, the animation and noise indicators evoke the same Shadow Tactics or Desperados III goodness you’re probably expecting. Fine with me - that’s exactly what I’m here for. Mimimi’s closing was a real gutpunch, and while I don’t expect anyone to match their exceptional work any time soon, it’s at least reassuring to see Warsaw studio Artificer picking up the torch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We know why you’re here, so I’m going to get this preamble out of the way quickly, so you can just have the answer. At one point in Emio – The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club you need to write in what Mama Shoko’s real name is.


It’s Michiyo Miyashita.


You’re probably only here because the question comes up fast and then is replaced by the on-screen keyboard. Once the keyboard is up, you can’t bring up the dialogue history to see it again, meaning you have to memorize the name and its spelling in advance before you can answer the question. It’s a bit of a design problem.


On the other hand, it does present one of Emio – The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club’s rare “Game Over” screens. It turns out to be a gag, and if you could easily look up the name (like you maybe just did), then you’d miss it entirely.


Screenshot by Destructoid


The question comes up after Kamihara introduces you to the bartender, Mama Shoko. She apparently knows everything about the area, but she doesn’t trust police, and while you’re not a police officer, you’re close enough, and she doesn’t trust you either. You have to impress her before you open up. Guessing her name is how it’s done. To find her name, you have to read the Health and Safety placard directly behind her (next to the alcohol). Your character will then deduce that the name on it is Mama Shoko’s real moniker, and you can then start the dialogue by asking about Mama Shoko.


Once you’ve entered the name, she’ll then reveal a big secret to you. It’s not going to crack the case wide open, but it will confirm a few things. I won’t spoil it for you, but even if I did, you probably didn’t read this far.

It’s not really an investigation game, as you don’t have much agency in searching for answers, so it’s largely linear. Having said that, how long does it take to complete?


It will probably take you between 12-15 hours.


There isn’t really much you can do in terms of side activities, and the structure is rather rigid. There may be some moments where you don’t know what the game is expecting from you, and you’ll find yourself temporarily stuck, but it’s unlikely it will be for very long. There aren’t many variables, and you can always “Think” to get a hint. There isn’t much you can do to really extend your playtime.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Emio – The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club is the third core title in the Famicom Detective Club series. What was formerly Japan-exclusive finally came to North America in 2021 as Famicom Detective Club: The Missing Heir and The Girl Who Stands Behind. How important is it to have played those games before starting Emio.


Not all that important, as it turns out. Emio is its own mystery and features characters who are newly introduced to the series. There are some returning faces like Mr. Utsugi, Ayumi, and Detective Kamada, but their roles require no previous introduction.


Likewise, there are references made to previous games, but knowing what they refer to, specifically, doesn’t really matter. The protagonist sometimes refers to his parents and troubled childhood, but it’s within context. He also mentions having a previous bout of amnesia, but that’s all you need to know. The references made are within the context of the current case, so intimate knowledge isn’t required.


Familiarity can enrich the experience, however. It’s also worth noting that the remakes of the first two Famicom Detective Club games are very recent and close to the standards of Emio. If you’re curious about the series, it might be more fun to start at the beginning (The Missing Heir if following release order, The Girl Who Stands Behind if you prefer chronologically). However, if the plots of those two games don’t interest you, while the idea of a bag-enshrouded serial killer is more enticing, then you won’t lose much if you skip ahead and start with Emio.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Shadowheart isn’t my favorite character in Baldur’s Gate 3, but she is absolutely essential to my party’s setup in combat. That's especially for those parties looking to keep Origin characters within their canonical classes.


It’s always good to keep a Cleric on hand, and since I can never bring myself to roll one as my main character, Shadowheart is my trusty standby. Clerics have an incredible spell list, and it’s not all just support abilities. I can’t tell you how many times Spirit Guardians or Turn Undead has gotten me out of an unexpected jam. 


Perfecting Shadowheart’s build is mostly about choosing the right spells and equipment, but the right feats can help you maximize everything else you’ve got going on. Here are my recommendations.

It's a powerful duo that instantly put Reynatis on my radar. 




Modern Day Shibuya


At its core, Reynatis is an Action RPG that takes place in a realistic depiction of the Japanese commercial district of Shibuya. However, in the world of Reynatis, there are wizards with the ability to utilize magic, though not everyone has such powers. As such, powerful organizations have formed seeking to oppress and liberate the wizards due to fears over their power. It reminds me of the dynamic from Harry…]]></summary>

The studio that brought us shirtless, growling men who punch each other on rooftops announced the showcase during a livestream earlier today. Studio head Yokoyama Masayoshi was on set with several other RGG folks, including the voice of Kasuga Ichiban and Nishikiyama Akira, Nakatani Kazuhiro. The livestream was a brisk one-hour long with the crew showcasing the Nintendo Switch version of Yakuza Kiwami, which was revealed during yesterday's Nintendo Direct. Near the end of the livestream, RGG revealed the showcase and its date.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Once you’re well into Chapter 3 of Black Myth: Wukong, you might stumble upon this really eerie temple called The Great Pagoda. You’re running all over this place trying to figure out what the heck you need to do here, but worry not, this is what you need to know.


What to do in The Great Pagoda in Black Myth: Wukong


This area won’t have any significance until you complete the main story and beat all other secret areas. 


Every chapter in Black Myth: Wukong will have an area that starts with “Secret:” followed by a few Shrine points. You have to do that if you did not find them, excluding Chapter 3. So let’s get that first.


Screenshot by Destructoid


Here are all the secret areas in the game:



Chapter 1 (Black Wind Mountain): Ancient Guanyin Temple


Chapter 2 (Yellow Wind Ridge): Kingdom of Sahali


Chapter 3 (The New West): Mount Mei (post-final boss)


Chapter 4 (The Webbed Hollow): Purple Cloud Mountain


Chapter 5 (Flaming Mountains): Bishui Cave



Select “Continue Journey” in the main menu with that under your belt. Do not select “Enter a New Cycle”. Otherwise, you will be thrown into New Game Plus and there will be no way to return to your first playthrough.


As you spawn back in your first playthrough, go back and revisit the Great Pagoda from Chapter 3. Go up the stairs to the far center of the area to initiate a new post-game cutscene.


Screenshot by Destructoid


You’ll once again meet up with the little kid Buddha. He’ll unveil a secret behind the painting which you can now go through. What ends up happening now is that you’re going to enter an area called Mount Mei, the secret area of Chapter 3. 


It’s a fairly straightforward area where you will encounter a familiar foe. For spoiler reasons, this will be left out. Upon defeating this secret boss, you’ll get the true final ending.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Welcome to Natlan, the nation of Pyro in Genshin Impact! With a new nation comes a new set of 4-star craftable weapons, some of which are actually quite good. Here’s where to find the blueprints for Natlan’s weapons so you can craft as many as you need.


Natlan Smithy location: Stadium of the Sacred Flame


All of Natlan’s craftable weapon blueprints can be purchased from Alom at Natlan’s Smithy. The Smithy is located in the southern section of the Stadium of the Sacred Flame. From the teleporter at the entrance to the Stadium, walk forward until you see a small set of stairs to the left. Go up the stairs and through the door. Head down the corridor, and you should be face to face with the Smithy.

Talk to Alom and ask to buy some weapons. He has the forging blueprints for Natlan’s craftable weapons for sale. They don’t cost Mora, though. Instead, you’ll need to trade various Natlan regional materials as well as Condessence Crystals.

Once you have the blueprints, the weapons can be forged using Condessence Crystals, White Iron Chunks, and Borderland billets. If you don’t have Borderland billets, you can convert billets of another type at an Alchemy bench. Before you spend your precious billets, though, you might be able to get some of them for free.


Get some Natlan weapons for free


At the time of writing, Genshin Impact has a web event with three of the craftable weapons as prizes. All three weapons have been unlocked as rewards, so all you need to do is click through the web event to receive them. This only takes a few minutes, and your rewards should be delivered instantly via in-game mail. The web event runs until September 24, so if you haven’t participated yet, do it now!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sdružení CZ.NIC oznamuje ukončení podpory starší verze protokolu OpenID 2.0. Jak uvádí Jaromír Talíř na blogu CZ.NIC: „Když se MojeID v roce 2015 poprvé začalo připravovat na využití jako oficiální identita pro občany České republiky a došlo k zapojení do pilotního projektu přeshraniční identifikace STORK, muselo se MojeID přeci jen naučit protokol SAML 2.0. V té době již také došlo ke standardizaci OpenID Connect a jak jste se mohli dočíst na našem blogu, MojeID se tak rychle stalo službou, ke které je možné se připojit libovolným z těchto protokolů. Protokol OpenID 2.0 nicméně má svoje nejlepší léta za sebou a proto padlo rozhodnutí jeho podporu ukončit.“]]></summary>

Hot off the back of yesterday's surprise announcement and shadow drop for the Castlevania Dominus Collection, Limited Run Games has today confirmed that a physical release is on the way.
The collection, which comprises Dawn of Sorrow, Portrait of Ruin and Order of Ecclesia, will be available to pre-order from the Limited Run Games website from 13th September. Fittingly, you'll get to choose between a trio of covers so you can have your favourite entry front and centre (either that, or you'll just have to pay up three times).

Originally announced before PAX West 2023, the game is based on the hugely-popular cartoon from the '90s which follows the lives of a group of toddler friends. Tommy, Chickie, Phil, and Lil are all playable, and you can swap between all four of them with cameos from other characters and toys

Please let it still be under 40 – and realise with alarm that, by extrapolation, a lot of the people reading this probably have children. Augh, children! Please excuse me while I go stand on a chair, clutching a broom. I’ve never understood the craze for generating smaller versions of yourself. It’s one of those weirder subcultures you read about in the papers, but rarely observe in daily life. 


I do, however, understand the appeal of same-screen co-op games like Run From Mummies - which, being a bloodless comedy dungeon romp, seems like a fair pick for those encumbered with boisterous selfspawn. Don’t worry, the “mummies” of the title are just regular old disembowelled corpses wrapped in cloth, not those sinister, non-embalmed “mothers” you’ve been hearing about down the grocers.

When ten citizens dropped dead on the roads of one of my settlements in post-apocalyptic city builder Endzone 2, I had to work fast to avoid a sickness breaking out. But graveyards require a lot of space, and if you've already filled your shanty town with a sea of corrugated metal roofs, this poses a problem. Welcome to the pleasant headache of town planning in a post-nuclear world, where most of the land is brown and uninhabitable.

While it's not quite as chaotic and entangled as say, Disgaea, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is one of those games. I'd call it "baroque", but that would be out of synch with developer Sandfall Interactive's stated influences: the new RPG takes place in a molten and fragmented fantasy world based on the Belle Époque or "beautiful era" of late 19th century France. Your job as player is to stop a sorcerous Paintress from painting everybody over a certain age out of existence. We'll circle back to the plot, though. First, the excessively ornate battlin'.

Has there ever been a horror movie that's used elevator music successfully as its entire soundtrack? We mean a reasonably good one. Any suggestions? It almost seems there may be something tonally mismatched about the idea — unless you're going for comedy — and, honestly, when playing Emio - The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club, it's sometimes tough to know whether it's horror or humour we're supposed to be enjoying. It's hard to know whether to laugh or cry.
This brand new entry in the Famicom Detective Club adventure series has managed to arrive to quite a bit more fanfare and interest than would usually be reserved for an entry in a visual novel franchise that, whilst perfectly fine, has never really set the gaming world alight. Old has-beens (like this writer) sampled Tantei Club Part II via fan translation and enjoyed it for what it was, but whilst the 2021 remakes are nice to have, it's hard to say they are absolute must-plays, even whilst recognising their importance in terms of influencing the likes of Ace Attorney.

It's a free-to-play game, but has a business model that makes you feel like you're getting a rougher deal than if you just dropped thirty notes for it outright. It's available now in Early Access, but has already been available in a kind of gravity-defying Super Early Access for several weeks (which you had to pay to get into).


All of which has made me feel very tired, and yearn for the days when you went into a shop and bought a game in a box for a set amount of money, and the whole game was in the box and you went home and put it on your PC and played it until your mum said "Richard!" (only my mum calls me Richard) "get off that computer and go outside and get some exercise! Do you want to be dead at 35?" Well, I'm 36 now mum. Nearly 37. So who's laughing through their heart palpitations now?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Update:  This evening, we received the following "communication from the Spiders studio":

Paris, 28th August 2024 – The Union of Video Game Workers (Syndicat des
Travailleurs (ses) du Jeu Vidéo) has publicly relayed allegations concerning the
working environment at Spiders. The false and even defamatory accusations made by
the STJV in no way reflect the reality of the day-to-day working life of the company's
employees and are an attack on the reputation of the studio, whose teams are fully
mobilized to produce quality games and enthusiastically ensure the Early Access
release of GreedFall 2.

Spiders' management is committed to open and constructive social dialogue. After
unsuccessful attempts over the last few days to meet with a delegation of employees,
they have proposed a meeting again by the end of the week.

Spiders' employees are the heart of the studio, and we are determined to maintain an
inclusive and stimulating working environment in which every talent can flourish and of
which we can all be proud.

The email was signed by Consulting Director Caroline Richard and Associate Director Laurence Tovi.

I’m not made of whippets, and you can just as easily find out yourself via the Steam demo.

While it would be a monumentally silly heel turn to go back on their promise of only charging Space Marine 2 players extra for cosmetics a mere week and change before the shooter’s September 9 release date,  the new year one roadmap does at least look piously forthright.
Chatting to James at Gamescom recently (possibly from his cathedral ship made out of graphics cards), Saber boss Tim Willits dragged out an armoured horse and proceeded to flog it mercilessly, saying that players don’t want to be sold the equivalent of Oblivion's infamous deadbeat daddy of DLCs. As several of you identified, this seemed like an odd comparison when Spice Maureen 2 specifically plans to charge for comparable cosmetics, although I imagine Willits was referencing the “packs” that his space game’s baubles come in. “Our fans never thought we ripped them off in World War Z,” he said, comparing Space Marine 2’s optional spendables to that game.
Whether you see the cosmetic's pricing as egregious or not, yesterday’s roadmap does look to make good on Saber’s promise to keep wearables and playables separate. Here’s it:

I have ample nostalgia for the old marsupial myself, with his second Naughty Dog-developed outing being a particular obsession, but come now, we're all about deckbuilders, soulsliking and battle royale nowadays, right?
Still, I'll admit to a twinge of disappointment after reading that a Crash Bandicoot 5 was once in development at Crash 4: It's About Time developers Toys For Bob, and might have featured an interdimensional team-up with one of Crash's old rivals. No, not Mario.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When we talk about a game having a sense of place, it’s often about how adroitly it covers up the necessary falsehoods of a world contrived to accommodate the player character. It’s the good kind of lie. One with purpose, like Lucas smearing vaseline over the camera lens to cover up the landspeeder’s wheels. Star Wars Outlaws, then, is a strange case. Because while its planets and cities do feel ersatz as living places, they’re kind of incredible as film sets. That’s your job here. This is where the game is. You don’t play it so much as you perform your role in a series of loving, enthusiastic callbacks. That’s a star war. This is a star war. Oh, hey, I know that! That’s one of my favourite star warses.

He is, however, never stepped upon by a mech with a missile launcher. He is never given a shotgun and tasked with shooting the other animals.

Supermassive Games and Behaviour Interactive must have gotten the memo too. They've just released a demo for their next horror game The Casting Of Frank Stone, in which you are a policeman, Sam Green, who is investigating the disappearance of a child. The search leads you to Cedar Hills Steel Mill, "where chilling secrets await, revealing a far more sinister truth than anyone could have anticipated". I am anticipating: QTEs during escape sequences, branching choices that get people killed, and General Mature Content appropriate to the coming of Halloween.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Almost a decade after his acrimonious departure from Konami, the shadow of Hideo Kojima still looms over Metal Gear Solid. He's there, barely camouflaged, in the undergrowth of Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater - a remake of the fifth Metal Gear game, originally released in 2004, which tells the tale of a lone US special operator hunting superweapons and old mentors in the jungles of the southern Soviet Union. 


I say "remake" but this feels more like a re-release, in spirit. True, it now runs on Unreal Engine, with the option of a manual, third-person perspective and cover-shooter controls in addition to the old top-down viewpoints. Yes, it boasts new flourishes, such as wounds now leaving scars, and clothes picking up stray leaves. Yes, there's a new interface with floating in-world menus, which makes shuffling between the layers a bit less awkward. It's the product of much labour, with development split between Konami and external support partner Virtuos. But where Konami's other big restoration project, Bloober's Silent Hill 2 remake, is a creative dialogue with the original game, Delta seems consumed by faithfulness to Kojima's original design.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Everything I know about the French Revolution has hitherto come from two literary works: Hilary Mantel's excellent doorstopper A Place Of Greater Safety, and Kate Beaton's webcomics. Neither Mantel nor Beaton mention mechs, which are a core feature of Studio Imugi's new "ideology driven" turn-based strategy game Bonaparte: A Mechanized Revolution. I, for one, feel like I've been grossly ill-informed. Kate, Hilary - I've been quoting you for years at parties and it seems like all this time, people have been silently judging me for my ignorance of the role giant clockwork soldiers played in the fall of the Bastille.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["Age of Empires with dinosaurs" is, the developers of the Dinolords recently told me in a cramped Gamescom booth, a flattering description for their upcoming England vs. Vikingsaurus RTS. It’s also not a terribly accurate one. From what I saw of the game, Dinolords is more about the lords than the dinos, having as much in common with Diablo-style ARPGs as it does with classic strategy. And that’s a distinction which might just elevate it out of novelty status.

Trailered this week at Gamescom 2024, it's the fifth installment in the hitherto mobile-focussed Nikki series and it's seemingly going down a storm, with over 12 million pre-registrations so far (albeit, many of them motivated by the prospect of collectively unlocked in-game bonuses). It's also a free-to-play game, and I have the usual unanswered questions about currencies and gacha, but I'm willing to give it the benefit of the doubt for the minute, because I have not spent nearly enough of my life considering the tactical applications of ballgowns. Here's that trailer.

That discussion was back on my mind as I sat down to play Reignbreaker, a new action-roguelike from Studio Fizbin, at Gamescom 2024 – slightly wary of its self-described medievalpunk styling. However! Turns out you’re trying to kill the queen. Yep, that’s, uh, that’s pretty punk.

Perhaps the cause is that there's no Maccies or TK Maxx at the local Bull Ring yet.

It’s a real...pane.
Now, I might have to start again, even if going out of my way to grab the tapes added in its developer's commentary mode is going to be extra tricky. Ah, but will being able to chuck the recorders at my enemies for a point of knockback afterwards make up for it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of my formative video game moments is the final mission of Psygnosis cyberpunk flight sim G-Police. (It came out in 1997, and as such, I think the statute of limitations on spoilers has passed, but if you still intend to play, stop reading now.) The mission completes the long arc of foreshadowing begun by the intro's mention that capital-class spacecraft have been outlawed, following a ruinous war. It turns out that one particular evil corpo has been sneakily building one of these megaships - not only that, but you get to fly inside it, cannons ablazing. It was while doing so that teenage me realised the true exceptionality of the Video Game Artform. You can't fly inside capital ships in, like, symbolist poems or baroque symphonies, can you? You can't fly in poems or symphonies at all, unless you do so metaphorically - "metaphor" being a kind of poor man's graphics card.
The technology of flight simming has advanced mightily since G-Police's day. For instance: in Everspace 2's just-announced Titans DLC, you get to fly inside not just regular old spaceships, but massive space kaiju with procedurally generated digestive systems. Here's the trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Assassin's Creed: Valhalla, Odyssey, and Origins all have one thing in common: they've got a Discovery mode, which replaces murdering with learning. You can, quite literally, go on tours curated by historians around each of the game's respective maps. Instead of diving off a Sphinx and plunging your hidden blade into someone's spinal column, you can look up at the Sphinx and read a paragraph on its significance. Maybe view an actual, real life bit of ancient Egypt from an actual real life museum collection in-game. Perhaps embody an Anglo-Saxon lad in Valhalla, instead, and like, cook up some nettle soup having just got a fresh "Friar Tuck" at the local hair choppers (no guarantees on this last bit).
This is all to say that Black Myth: Wukong deserves such a mode, too. There were so many times throughout my review time where I stopped and stared and wondered as to something's meaning. Not only in the architecture, but in the characters, too. So here I am with a proposition: how about instead of thwacking things with my staff, I can use it as a walking stick and point it at things I want to learn about.

Yeah, a new Tokyo Xtreme Racer was just announced from original developers Genki, and it's targeting a Steam release next year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft have announced Heroes of Might & Magic: Olden Era, a fresh instalment in the exceedingly olden turn-based strategy RPG series, which began life under New World Computing in 1995. The new game will “return to the world of Enroth and the origins of the legendary saga”, inviting “both veterans and new players” to go on a quest to Jadame, “a mysterious continent in turmoil”. Expect new factions, biomes and creatures, together with such M&M standbys as castle management, army clashes, hex-based maps, and, who knows, maybe some heroes.

Developers Striking Distance and publishers Krafton have revealed [REDACTED], a scifi roguelike dungeon crawler set in the same universe.
The square brackets are part of the title, yes, and they're also calling it "punk rock" - a combination of factors that fills me with a rage so obliterating, I can barely perceive the announcement trailer, below. It's a machinegun montage of comicbook panels and sizzling melee arcs and quips like "there's a lot of wankers between you and the sweet taste of freedom". I didn't even like The Callisto Protocol that much but still, what have they done to you, boy? Where did all the horror game go?

It’s not that developer Dee Dee Creations haven’t shown off the game in action. It’s just that I find myself rooting so hard for this not to just be a vapid bit of meme-ware that I’m getting more concerned as we rapidly approach its 29th August release.

If a park sim based on Tim Burton’s 1996 B-Movie homage Mars Attacks wasn’t on my bingo card, it’s because I’ve recently binned it and replaced it with a bobble head that simply nods in amused acceptance at whatever videogames decide to do next. And conceptually, Jurassic World Evolution with captive humans instead of dinos isn’t not a potential winner, is it? Still, I was mildly bemused to learn that Mars Attracts, coming sometime next year, is the film’s first licensed game. But then I realised that I’d never thought to check before, which might go some way to explaining the lack of them. Do you reckon they did the pun then worked backwards from there? Respectable, honestly.

My turn to puff out my cheeks and look not angry, just disappointed: why haven't we covered The Stone Of Madness prior to the below Gamescom 2024 story trailer? I mean, it's only a real-time tactical stealth game set in a cursed 18th century Jesuit monastery, developed by the people behind gorgeously gross metroidvania Blasphemous. It's only got isometric art inspired by Goya and a sanity/trauma system redolent of Darkest Dungeon. Sounds like an automatic RPS write-up to me.

He'd tackle headscratchers by unwinding the very fabric of his body, similar to how a human being might feed their intestines through a karabiner and use it as a tether for a spot of rock climbing. Well, some of the minds behind Unravel are working on new game called Hela. This time it's less about yarn and more about being a small mouse who does parkour. Still, it does retain some of the bodily gymnastics of its predecessor. Namely the use of tongues as bungee ropes.

Whether plundering the earth in SteamWorld Dig 2 or mucking about with magic in SteamWorld Quest, these are solid and approachable adventures that enthusiastically embrace whatever theme the developers have decided upon. Cowboys? Sure. Wizards? Why not. It barely matters, as long as it results in some good puns. As a studio, Thunderful have a reputation for hopping from one style of game to the next, boiling entire genres down to their essence, and reconstituting them with competence and style to exist within a now-familiar steampunk world of colourful pals and Saturday morning cartoon jokes. The studio is a perpetual notion machine. Yes, with SteamWorld Heist 2, they're revisiting the sci-fi bullet-bouncing of their 2016 tactics game SteamWorld Heist, but they're also introducing significant changes to create a compulsive XCOM-like full of sea-faring submariners that may be their best work yet, even against a back catalogue of blinders.

The Shattered Space expansion, out on September 30th, probably won’t refurbish the RPG’s reputation as an overall miss – but it does ditch the proc-gen planet bloat for a single handcrafted hellhole, a true Bethesda speciality honed by years of Fallouts and Elder Scrollseses. And, if its - sadly hands-off - Gamescom showcase is any indication, it might just double down on Starfield’s own strengths as well.

In development at Sniper Elite makers Rebellion, it’s a "survival-action game inspired by real-life events" – specifically the Windscale fire, which in 1957 coated much of northern England in radioactive fallout. Atomfall’s alternative history makes Britain’s worst nuclear disaster even more disastrous, plunging the realm into full-on post-apocalyptica and leaving your good amnesiac self to dodge death with nothing but a cricket bat and whatever you can scrounge out of sheds. I like it! Mostly.

I dare boldly to maintain that there is such a thing as Too Wide, a point beyond which the extra visual estate becomes a waste of electricity, unless you watch the screen in pairs. I can only assume people who use ultrawide monitors live in constant terror of flanking manoeuvres and demand the maximum amount of peripheral vision. Mind you, I tend to play games with my nose about 10 centimetres from the screen. Forget being flanked - it's the prospect of snipers up ahead I'm worried about.
If you're among the people who fret excessively about flankers, I've got great news from Uncle BioWare. Forthcoming RPG Dragon Age: The Veilguard will support 21:9 ultrawide monitors. The ultrawide functionality extends to cinematics - you can disable "cinematic aspect ratios" to switch off the black bars that otherwise hem in the view. It's one of several PC-specific flourishes they've just blogged about. Have a look.

Unfortunately for James, he accidentally walked straight into Gamescom. “I’m starting to think that there are a lot of video games” he informed us yesterday. Horrifying if true. Still, it does sound like he’s managing to have some fun there, mainly by hitting up Saber Interactive COO and former id Software co-owner Tim Willits for some top tips on how to avenge Edwin’s thieving ways.
Tips about kill-stealing aside, James found time to ask Willits about Space Marine 2's microtransactions, and whether there was any nervousness returning to a cult hit series… especially one a lot of people had almost given up on ever seeing again. “Even the “push forward” combat of the original was part of [id’s] inspiration when we created Doom 2016,” answered Willits. “So for me personally, it’s this huge circle. It’s always intimidating working on a franchise that people love.” But, with the right team, technology, and vision he says, “it just comes together.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Now, I never played quite as much as our Brendy did of the original Splitgate. But I had a fun time with its mixture of Halo-esque trigger pulling and portalling around! So I was intrigued to give the alpha version of Splitgate 2 a go and see if it had a little more substance to it than its initial reveal, which gave off a, "it's Splitgate but with more money" feel. 
Well, I think it's… a bit serious? It certainly has more polish and some extra additions, yet I didn't come away from it thrilled by its more competitive, class-based FPS leanings. I think it just needs a bit more time, perhaps, for a portal to open and some silly rocket launchers and baseball bats and zombies to come tumbling out of it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Marvel Rivals, Netease' free-to-play Overwatch wannabe comprised of superheroes from the Marvelverse, is set to launch on December 6th. And in a "hah, take this Overwatch!" way, they've also announced that all of its heroes will be unlocked for everyone straight off the bat (man). Oh no wait, he's DC isn't he. To be fair, I've only watched one Avengers film, two Captain Americas, and Thor: Ragnarok (without seeing the other Thors). All of which I have zero recollection of. Anyway, yes, Marvel Rivals.

If you have have experience of the London rental market, you are probably reading this and thinking: “He’s got a front door? Such extravagance. I live in a folded umbrella.” Touché, my friend. I guess it’s just as well we have spaciously proportioned first-person puzzle adventures to console us in our time of compound elbow bruises, rising damp and preposterous financial debt. On which note, Looking For Fael seems fun.

Yes, yes, it is the unmistakable rumble of a large survival MMO pondering its release date. Dune: Awakening is having a think and has decided "early 2025" is a good non-specific time period to come out in early access. That could mean January or February. Or March, I guess. April? Now don't be silly, that's spring. Not April, surely. This beast seems hungry. It will eat before then. I have foreseen it. Mostly by watching the trailer that dropped at Gamescom.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Arc Raiders was announced back in 2021 as a free-to-play co-op third-person shooter, and has been delayed several times since. That's partly because Embark Studios' other in-development game, The Finals, progressed faster than planned and stole its momentum. It's also because it was re-tooled at some point as a PvPvE extraction shooter.

Now it's back again, aiming for release next year, and it's been re-tooled a little more: it's no longer free-to-play.

It’s just actor Troy Baker telling me about all the great acting he’ll be doing. It is great, by the way. He’s doing a fantastic job. Maybe just, you know, a crumb of acknowledgement or elucidation over the whole ‘interactivity’ part?
Anyway, don’t mind me. I’m just an old fool who likes to press buttons. And, to be fair, it's not like Machinegames don't have a great track record. Anyway, here’s some good news: The game releases December 9th this year. Have a release date trailer.

So much so, in fact, that I’d assumed the trailer I watched during an online preview event last week was for a new entry in the horror cinematic-platformer series, right up until the name Reanimal appeared on the screen - shortly followed by a snippet of voiced dialogue.
It’s not just the horror setting, but the Grimm’s fairytale threat, the distorted adults-made-monsters through the trauma-tinged lens of a child’s imagination. A long-limbed man riding a bicycle in a threadbare suit chases children down an alley. A gangly, bowler-hatted pursuer scuttles down a long table like a spider. It's familiar enough territory, at least at first glance. But when Tarsier have a body of work subconsciously scarred by phantasms this vivid, recurring nightmares are just as potent.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's a new instalment of Supermassive's Dark Pictures anthology series on the way, and it's set in Outer Space, wherein you'll find the Darkest Pictures of all. Out in 2025, Directive 8020 is the story of the good ship Cassiopeia, a human colony vessel that is infiltrated by Something Icky. The Something Icky is capable of mimicking humans. So that'd be a bit like Alien and a bit like The Thing, then. Sorry, human colonists!
Directive 8020 was teased at the end of the last Dark Pictures instalment, 2022's The Devil in Me. A trailer also leaked back in November 2022. Now, we have an official announcement video.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Update: Oh, I missed this. "To show appreciation for the community who patiently waited for the DLC, Techland will be offering Dying Light: The Beast at no extra cost to all owners of the Dying Light 2 Stay Human Ultimate Edition, delivering a full standalone adventure instead of just a DLC." That's nice! 
This seems like an odd one. I’m only tangentially familiar with the Dying Light games, but I was under the impression that the model here was releasing a single game, then updating and expanding it for years. Whether standalone adventure Dying Light: The Beast represents an attempt to course correct after Dying Light 2’s mixed reception, then, I’m not entirely sure. But if nothing else, it does share something in common with all the other adverts at Gamescom tonight: it is a game that exists, and will presumably be playable at some point.

And if - as we surely must - we judge the eagerness of these adverts to spend time with us by how quickly they appear on our screens, then FPS sequel Borderlands 4 surely loves us the most.
Do we love it back? Who knows. But it does exist, and it isn’t using a subtitle. That’s got to count for something, right?

This means it's very much a simulation game where you're fighting terrain with tyres, except this time you aren't just driving about, but managing a fleet of machines to carry out heavy construction work. Think a mixture of logistics, cars, cranes, and paving some lovely new roads from a once dilapidated junk heap.

You could make the same argument at the opposite end of spectrum, of course. Cosy games seem locked in a perpetual arms-race to twee each other into the dirt, chopping their rival’s dog-petting hands off and taking a sparkly tinkle on their pastel corpses. But hand-drawn RPG Heroes Of The Seven Islands feels more authentic than all that. It’s bedroom antifolk by way of chill dungeon synth, by way of an antelope sorcerer named Jean-Pierre.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Our Black Myth: Wukong review hails the game as "a generous Soulsy adventure hybrid that works within its limitations and delivers a beautiful challenge to be unpicked with a magical toolbox". Reviewer Edders went so far as to find the world more engaging than that of Elden Ring - proper defying-the-gods level rhetoric. Players seem to agree. The game launched last night, and has already accrued a concurrent player peak of 1.44 million - Steam's fourth highest ever, exceeded only by Counter-Strike, Palworld and PUBG. By that metric, it's the platform's most popular strictly single player game of all the time.
All that goodwill has been spoiled, however, by a Steam code handout message to streamers and other "content creators" before launch which includes some reactionary, non-binding requests - no mention of "trigger words" like "Covid-19", no talk of "politics" or "feminist propaganda", and no mention of "China's game industry policies, opinions, news, etc".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tactical Breach Wizards is a tactics game for people that don’t like tactics games. Magically, it’s also a tactics game for people who love them like nothing else. It’s permissive and demanding; playful and tense. Its globe-spanning plot covers conspiracies, PMCs, and brutal theocratic dictatorships. It also features a traffic-summoning warlock named Steve wearing a hi-vis robe. It’s finding that one absolutely, perfectly ridiculous XCOM turn, every turn…and at the same time knowing it’s absolutely, perfectly fine if you don’t. In short: it’s one of the most enjoyable tactics games I’ve ever played, and the only tactics game with a pyromancer so rubbish he relies on making his enemies pass out from heatstroke.

They've also shared a little about why it's taken so long to arrive - the (generally decent) action-RPG hit PS5 over a year ago, back when I was still some filthy console-playing freelancer.
According to director Hiroshi Takai, it was "impossible" to create the PC and PS5 versions at the same time, even if Square Enix hadn't been restrained by a timed exclusivity clause. He also thinks that the Final Fantasy series faces no "existential risk" right now, despite lower-than-hoped returns from both Final Fantasy 16 and, going by Square Enix's latest financial reports, the more recent and currently PS5-only Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Silent Hill has a messy, up-is-down relationship with time and history, so let's go about this hands-on with the Silent Hill 2 Remake in a messy, up-is-down way. Developed well over two decades ago, the original Silent Hill 2 is the magnum opus of Polish horror stalwarts Bloober Team. Running on then-innovative "Unreal Engine 5" technology created by Jazz Jackrabbit publishers Epic MegaGames, it's a wonderful abyss of a game that remains perfectly playable today, given a certain amount of tolerance for the quirks of the era.
It begins with your character, James Sunderland, descending from the road towards the eponymous Midwestern nowhere-town. Like many games of the period, Silent Hill 2 uses a third-person, over-the-shoulder manual camera, which allows you to glance fearfully up at the monstrous pine trees that fringe the path - each rising from a bulging tide of fog that menaces with the suggestion of approaching figures. There is moisture everywhere, gushing from drain pipes and dribbling down concrete barriers. As you amble into the murk, deathly chords and groaning, unmechanical motifs reverberate from somewhere deep underground.

The 2022 version of Modern Warfare 2 lacked the original’s multiplayer, and H2M was so highly-anticipated that Steam sales of the 2016 FPS balooned in the lead-up to the mod’s planned release date. It didn't hurt that Activision had it on sale, of course, but the timing lined up so well that some fans speculated the discount was a deliberate bait-and-switch on the publisher’s part to profit from excitement over a mod they were already planning to shut down.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[New week, same old terror of that cyclopean glutton known as the Maw emerging from its cosmic bolthole and swallowing the entirety of Devon. As ever, we have a way of thwarting the Maw's advance, and it's... pasta sauce? Graham, why is there pasta sauce in the Trello? Have Ziff Davis subfranchised us to Dolmio? Oh, I'm sorry! That's just my shopping list. What I meant to say was: new video games! Video games (PC games, specifically) are the only thing that can preoccupy the Maw, the only thing newsworthy enough to distract it from the tempting clifftop maisonettes of Torquay. Let's see what the week has in store for us, eh.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Bloober and Konami announced that they were remaking Silent Hill 2 as part of a comprehensive series reboot, it made immediate if slightly deflating sense to me. Silent Hill 2 is the more feted of the Hills - if I were a calculating franchise custodian tasked with 'bringing back' one of the acclaimed original trilogy, that's probably the instalment I and my spreadsheets would fix upon. I mean, it's the game with Pyramid Head in it - the nearest thing Silent Hill has to a mascot, and it's not like there's an issue of cutting out plot material: each game in the Silent Hill series is, on some level, a distinct story with a distinct protagonist.
Still, the decision to 'skip' the first game in the series, whose world, narrative themes, music and art direction set the parameters for all the rest, made my brain itch a bit, and when I ran into Bloober's creative director Mateusz Lenart and lead producer Maciej Głomb at a Konami event, I had to ask about it.

Many believed that the band itself was responsible, something we highlighted in our August 2009 article. Coinciding almost perfectly with the leak's 15-year anniversary, a complaint filed with Google now claims that the report violates copyright law and must be permanently deindexed from search results.

We had moderately high hopes for it before the early access release - I personally enjoy the fairytale setting, with its pop-up Pucks and magic umbrellas, but I also think I've raised enough hovels on procedurally generated maps for one lifetime. Still, I'd quite like it to come good, if only so I can justify op-eds about Lewis Carroll, and I'm somewhat encouraged by what I've heard of the game's forthcoming Realms Rebuilt update.

And either way, it's a spectacular journey that works for mostly everyone: those after challenging fights against Chinese mythological creatures, and those after the same thing, but with a little less challenge than your typical Soulslikes. What separates Black Myth from the crowd, though, is its slick presentation and a sense of generosity. You're to witness the most lavish, cinematic worlds and its creatures. And you're to enjoy battering everything with your staff as a highly athletic monkey with copious spells at his furry follicles and fingertips. It's been a while since I've played anything quite as impressive as this.

The strategy game’s 5.2 update is on the horizon, and tagging along with it are the first of the “extra bits” the team teased in June. I’m very excited about them. They sit somewhere between the usual patch fare of stat tweaks and errata, and the weightier faction facelifts that come alongside paid DLC. They’re also focused right where Immortal Empires needs them the most: depth, rather than width. In the dawi’s case, quite literally.

Both the stakes and the poly count were low. Happy news then, that it is getting a snowy sequel.
