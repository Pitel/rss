        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Infinity Nikki is blessing the world with its stunning visuals and fabulous outfits, and it's available as a free-to-play experience. Many are wondering, however, if there are any Infinity Nikki gacha elements to worry about. 


Are there Infinity Nikki gacha elements?


Infinity Nikki has you collect costumes for special abilities and gorgeous new outfits to wear in the game. While some can be received by simply progressing in the game, other outfits are exclusively gacha. 


Screenshot by Destructoid


How does the gacha system work?


It works very similarly to Genshin Impact. You can get four- and five-star outfits from the Resonance (like Wish) system. With every 10 Revelation or Resonite Crystals, you'll get a guaranteed  4-star or higher piece of an outfit. You'll need to gain Stellarites or Diamonds to get these Crystals. 


Diamonds act similarly to Primogems if you've played Genshin Impact. You'll gain them from completing quests and finishing in-game activities. These diamonds can be used to get the Revelation and Resonite Crystals. You'll need 120 of them to gain one, so 1,200 Diamonds are required to gain a 10-pull. 


If you want to skip the Diamond grinding, you can pay for Stellarites, another currency that can be used to gain Crystals. They cost the following in real money:


60
$0.99 USD / $1.29 CAD


300
$4.99 USD / $6.99 CAD


980
$14.99 USD / $19.99 CAD


1980
$29.99 USD / $39.99 CAD


3280
$49.99 USD / $65.99 CAD


6480
$99.99 USD / $129.99 CAD






With the first top-up, you'll get a double bonus. For example, if you spend $0.99 on 60 Stellarites, you'll get a bonus 60 Stellarites for 120 in total.


Certain costumes can be purchased outright. If you head to the bottom tab of the Store, you can access four different outfits, such as the Scalry Dream dress. They each vary in press and might be on sale.

Kindled Inspiration quests will be added to your quest log as soon as you talk to the NPC giving them out. They’re arguably pretty easy to complete as long as you can get a full understanding of what the person giving you the quest actually wants.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Once you’ve progressed a little way through the main story of Infinity Nikki and met Tokar at the Stylist’s Guild, you’ll begin to unlock Realms that can be visited via Warp Spires. These are a great way to get your hands on valuable rewards, but you need Vital Energy to take part in the challenges. 


Vital Energy is the currency that you pay to take part in Realm Challenges, and how much you’ll use in each Realm differs. If you’ve depleted your supply and want to go back for more, here’s how you can get more Vital Energy. 


How to get Vital Energy in Infinity Nikki





If you’re patient and want to restore your Vital Energy without spending any precious resources, then you’re in luck because Vital Energy will replenish by one every five minutes, so you’re going to get your supply back eventually if you just wait a little while and do other things. 


However, if you want to speed things along and get straight back to the action, you have a couple of options:


Purchase Vital Energy with Diamonds


Spending 50 Diamonds will restore 80 Vital Energy, which is enough to dip into the Realm of Eureka or the Realm of the Dark twice. However, you can only do this six times per day, costing 800 Diamonds and granting a maximum of 480 Vital Energy. 


Purchase Vital Energy with Energy Crystals


Alternatively, you can spend some Energy Crystals. These are rewarded for a number of things, including progression through the main story, completing side quests, opening up treasure chests, and through the Mira Journey. 


You can use as many Energy Crystals as you like, and they’ll also grant you 80 Vital Energy per Crystal that you spend. While this may seem like the preferable method to get your Energy back, bear in mind that the supply of Energy Crystals is going to diminish eventually, so it might be worth hoarding them and keeping them at hand for when this happens.

Does Marvel Rivals have crossplay?


In short, Marvel Rivals has crossplay between PC and consoles. It should be on by default when you first boot up the game. 


To ensure that crossplay is on, follow these steps:



Click settings (the gear wheel on the top right of the screen).


Select “Settings”


Find the Social tab.


Look for the “Social” section and check “CROSS-PLATFORM”.


Make sure the check mark is on.



Once that’s set, you can now toggle this feature on and off on the Play page in the main menu.

While the survey, which you can access right here, asks questions like "What's your favourite moment in the whole Shenmue series?" and "What graphics and performance improvements would you like to see for Shenmue III?", there's one big one that caught our eye:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The protagonists of two of my all time favourite RPGs share something in common. Both (the best Final Fantasy game) Final Fantasy 8’s Squall and The Witcher 3’s Geralt simply cannot get enough of leaving their friends and the entire world in mortal peril while they sneak in a quick round of cards, and I love them for it. Way back when the Wild Hunt released, there was a special edition kicking about that gave you a few decks for Gwent - the fleshed-out, playable card distraction that ended up being responsible for some of the game’s best moments. I pined for those decks, but I never acquired them. Now, Hatchette Board Games is putting out a full physical edition of Gwent next year.
The set contains "over 400 cards and a playmat" for £44/$39.99. I’m still recovering from various Fantasy Flight LCGs, so my value sense for this stuff might be a bit skewed, but that strikes me as incredibly reasonable. A good Gwent deck consists of only about 25 cards. They’re not bad cards, either! I’ve got a real pet hate for tabletop versions of videogames that just use in-engine screenshots for the cards, but these ones look to have the proper artwork from the game on them:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you’re wondering what SVP means in Marvel Rivals, I’m going to do what I’m not supposed to do in these sorts of articles and just give you an answer: it means Second Valuable Player.


So, if MVP means Most Valuable Player, then SVP is the runner-up: the Second Valuable Player. Another possible acronym could be SMVP or “Second-Most Valuable Player,” but I guess that doesn’t look as flash.


I don’t have much else to talk about, so let’s explore that. SVP is already a fairly common acronym. I don’t know if you see it much in other countries, but here in Canada (even the English-speaking parts), we see it as S'il Vous Plaît, which is French for please. In business, it is often seen as an abbreviation for Senior Vice President. In a legal sense, it’s sometimes applied to… Well, you can look that up if you want, but it’s a little dark for this subject matter, so we’ll leave that there.


In Marvel Rivals, the MVP and SVP are picked based on a number of factors, including KDR (Kill-Death Ratio), damage output, and damage healed or blocked. To boil it down in the most obvious way, it’s how much a person contributed to their team’s success based on metrics. I just felt like stressing that, since – and this is absolutely just hypothetical – someone being really encouraging over voice chat and keeping morale up on their team could – and again, this is hypothetical – have had the greatest positive effect on their team, but there’s no way for the scoring system to know that.


And really, some people may let chasing score get in the way of their sportsmanship. If someone is selfish chasing higher numbers at the expense of their team’s strategy or the enjoyment of others, then they could become MVP or SVP. The scoring system would be able to tell either way.


But I digress. If you scrolled down here figuring the answer would be at the end, I’ll give it to you again: SVP means Second Valuable Player.

Over the next decade developer Grinding Gear Games would continue to update and add to Path of Exile, turning it into one of the staple ARPGs in the genre. With consistent quarterly updates, PoE ballooned into a massive game with a simply insane amount of content.

Why, I remember it like it was March, and not actually Summer, when the delightful free game about a mucky pomeranian was unleashed into the world. Yep, yep. It was definitely March. Roughly translating to ‘covered in mud doggy’, the game set you the task of racking up tangible financial damage to your owner’s house by getting mud everywhere - first by normal dog means, and then with giant mud cannons. You can grab it for free on Steam here.
It stole our hearts, it did. And talking of stealing things and having a good time doing it, it’s also releasing on the Nintendo Switch soon, which means the Steam version of Doronko Wanko is getting some free DLC to celebrate. It isn’t arriving until next Spring, but it’s bringing three new mystery dog breeds with it when it does.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are over a million players waiting eagerly for Path of Exile 2's early access to begin, but there's a roadblock waiting for them as of writing. 


Just like the first title, the new game requires persistent internet connection at all times if you want to enjoy all the content. Based on the original schedule as revealed by the developers, the game should be live now as it's part 11 a.m. PST on December 6. Unfortunately, the servers are currently down as the developers are still working on the final details for the early access. 


There's no ETA as to when the servers are going to open for the early access. However, there might be server issues later down the road as well. Here are a few steps you can take to know if the servers are working as intended. 


How to check Path of Exile 2 server status


A great way to know if the servers are down or not is by knowing the status. Usually, the best way to do so is by following the official X account. For Path of Exile 2, the X account is the same as the first game. You can follow the handle by clicking on this link. Make sure to turn on your notifications, as there will be plenty of gameplay updates coming soon as well. 


Additionally, it's also crucial to ensure that there's no update going on in the future. With Path of Exile 2 entering early access, it's safe to expect plenty of changes to be made to the gameplay in the near future. GGG will be taking down the servers in case of maintenance, and you won't be able to play normally. 


If you're like me and waiting eagerly for the action to begin, the wait will have to be longer. Those trying to play the game right now are encountering the Unexpected Disconnection Account error. This should go away automatically once the servers are up.

While its conclusion received mixed reception, it's only proof that the series has many fans. Fortunately for the fans, it seems like My Hero Academia won't be the last Kohei Horikoshi manga.


Despite the manga's ten-year run, Horikoshi hasn't had his fill of creating manga. In fact, he revealed in an interview with Marvel that he is already slowly working on his next project.

Kohei Horikoshi's love for western superheroes is very apparent in his work in My Hero Academia. In fact, some of the main characters' attacks are named after American states. To celebrate the manga's final volume release and to give back to comic book fans worldwide, Marvel and Weekly Shonen Jump collaborated in an art exchange featuring beloved characters from both media.


However, Horikoshi doesn't simply provide beautiful artwork from All Might and Deku with the friendly neighborhood Spider-Man. He also revealed his plans for his next project:


"I feel really lucky over the success of MHA, so I know there's a lot of pressure around my next move. I'm planning to start a new manga as soon as I possibly can.


"I was thinking to committing myself to simply drawing my next project, and letting someone else write the story, but my editor advised me 'It will be better if you do it all yourself.' With that in mind, I've slowly started writing and drawing the thumbnails of my next manga. However, there are still several events left surrounding MHA, so for a while I'll still be committed to supporting and promoting it."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Eric Barone – also known as ConcernedApe – is most known for being the creator of Stardew Valley, which has gone down as one of the era-defining indie games in recent memory. Seriously, if you haven't played it, you are urged to treat yourself. However, years later, people have been wondering where Barone's next project is.


Although the developer has already said their next game, Haunted Chocolatier, is currently in the works, there have been very few, if any, updates since. But in a recent post on the upcoming game's website, Barone has made it clear that progress is underway. In fact, the message goes on to say they've "already done a ton of work on the game," adding that "essentially a skeleton of the game with most (not all) of its bones" is now in place.

Where to add friends in Marvel Rivals?


With Marvel Rivals heavily incentivizing teamwork during a match, having a few trusty friends with you can be the tide-turner. Thankfully, adding friends is super easy, regardless of which platform you're playing on.


First, open the game so that you're staring at the Main Menu screen. There's plenty you can click on, but for this, look to the top right part of the screen, where you'll see an icon that indicates 'Friends list.' It looks like a silhouette of two people standing one after another.

Here, we’ll break down what each currency does and how you can get more of them.


How to get Units in Marvel Rivals


Units are the blue currency that is earned in-game. Think of it as the free currency earned through completing Missions or progressing in the Battle Pass.


Missions are the equivalent of challenges in this game. Read what you need to do. For example, you may need to defeat five enemies using Storm or Captain America with Thorforce’s electrifying enhancement to get 60 Units. This is a Season 0 Mission, but it can be done for now.

Wario, the flatulent, garlic-loving counterpart to Mario's non-gassy, casual garlic admirer, first appeared in Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins and has since gone on to appear in not one, but two separate series of his own: Land and Ware. Everyone loves a bit of the plumber in yellow, but can any of our good readers claim to love him this much?
A few weeks back, we spied a rather impressive collection of Wario-themed merch from super fan Topher Putnam. Encompassing games, figures, plushies and manga — yes, Wario manga — this is a collection that we were keen to get a closer look at. So, we did just that.

The obvious reason for the error is implied by the error: your system configuration can’t handle DirectX 12. DX12 isn’t exactly new, but it’s new enough that some might still be running hardware before it was a thing (it launched in 2015). In fact, a lot of games still support DX10 and DX11, and it’s less common for a game to require DirectX 12 like Marvel Rivals does. So, if this is the first time you’ve seen something like this, then that’s why; DX12 isn’t universal.

As a result, NetEase’s swing at the genre feels like putting on a familiar glove to long-time players of Blizzard’s game. However, there are a few bits of minutiae…

Look, there's no shortage of "best of" lists for Nintendo Switch couch co-op games, and there are a lot of widely agreed-upon highlights out there. But what about folks like us who have exhausted those options and still want something fresh to play with our co-op partner of choice? What's left to play? It's a topic I routinely return to in my personal life.


I love chilling with games on my own, but I especially love playing games together. Bouncing ideas off each other, getting a little heated when you're not on the same page, eventually overcoming the odds — it's all part of the cycle, and it's (usually) a blast.


It's a bummer to look for a new weekend co-op game to share with a partner only to turn up…]]></summary>

This time, it's the Episode: Revenant Tonic system, as the feature does not reward what it's supposed to when gains are expected. Unfortunately, issues like this are growing in prominence, becoming an apparent new normal after Bungie's consolidation and shift in priorities.


The Tonic system in Episode: Revenant allows players to earn reagants through gameplay, which are used to brew concoctions in The Last City. The idea is that these Tonics can be used to increase or target farm certain rewards and buff specific abilities and effects. In practice, however, it hasn't really felt like the system worked. Each Tonic only lasts for a bit, a…]]></summary>

It has been a strange few months in Nintendo land. There hasn't been a Direct since August, but a series of strange announcements have been trickling out of the House of Mario nonetheless. There was Alarmo, Nintendo Music, Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition, and more random NSO drops than we can count. So now it's time we asked the ultimate question: what's going on at Nintendo right now?
Our wonderful video team got together this week to discuss just that. Naturally, none of us have the official answer — even though we'd all wager that it's a result of the Big N being full steam ahead on 'Switch 2' — but Alex, Felix and Zion sat down for a big old discussion about the company's recent releases and why things seem so random at the moment.

Donkey Kong 64 — not the most beloved of Rare's titles, but probably the developer's most ambitious 3D platformer — turns 25 here in Europe today, 6th December 2024.
DK and friends have a lot to celebrate lately: the Donkey Kong Land trilogy on Game Boy has trickled onto NSO over the past few weeks; the Donkey Kong Country expansion opens up at Universal Studios Japan on 11th December; and Donkey Kong Country Returns HD is the first big Switch release of 2025.

Well, this eShop beauty is getting a sequel — albeit one that isn't confirmed to join its predecessor on Switch.
Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault was revealed in last night's PC Gaming Show, showcasing the return of the monster-hunting shopkeeper, Will, and a new 3D twist on the formally top-down pixel art visuals.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.
Spirit Mancer, the inaugural release from Sunny Syrup Studio, is an ambitious game that flies a little too close to the sun. It’s a hack ‘n’ slash, an action platformer, an RPG, a monster catcher, and a deckbuilder, all rolled into one. If that sounds like too many ideas to cram into one game… well, it totally is, though Spirit Mancer still comes across as a modestly enjoyable and interesting game.
Spirit Mancer follows the story of two military-trained demon hunters, Sebastian and Mary, who are suddenly transported away from the human world to Inferno, where a wicked demon queen has stolen away their friends. Armed with the titular Spirit Mancer, which gives them limited control over demons, the two set out to free their friends, defeat the queen, and save the world.

The Hitlerites and blackshirts of Indiana Jones And The Great Circle sneeze and cough as they patrol the dig sites of Gizeh, or the marble corridors of the Vatican. Although this is the Machine Games' clever way of letting you know where your enemies are at all times, it is also mildly funny, as if all the Nazis have been secretly kissing each other, spreading the same rhinovirus from Italy to Egypt to Nepal and beyond. More than that, it's a stubborn reminder that, despite the many hours of perfectly motion-captured cinematics that accompany all this, you are still playing a video game. A snotty tissue that separates the Indy of taut two-hour cinema and the Indy of a sweeping first-person punch 'em up that will take days to complete.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Keep your arms inside the ride, for now.
Atari's RollerCoaster Tycoon Classic came speeding onto Switch this week and, honestly, it's an all-round good time. In our review, we praised the game's endless creative freedom and its ability to bring hours of rollercoaster-building fun, but there was one small omission in the Switch port that left us scratching our heads: where the heck are the touch controls?
The new control scheme has had some good thought put into it, and we had no issues with the button inputs when playing on the big screen. But given that the 2016 original boasted touchscreen functionality on its smart device launch platforms and, you know, the Switch has a touchscreen, it does feel like a strange feature to not make the cut.

At best. I’d successfully lured some bandits into the deadly lair of a bucket-tossing Poltergeist, but several attempts at more actively siccing mutated pigs on the Zone’s human baddies had all failed, even when I’d seemed to actually tame one.
Now, my only friend lay dead at my feet, and I’m in dire need of some new beasts to master. And some cash. It turns out that a fighting style that involves letting shopping trolley-sized swine creatures chew on my heels is bad for the ol’ HP, and having recently blown my savings on half a sausage, I’m forced to shift focus from my current debt collection mission towards a means to fill my own coffers.

Stardew Valley creator Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone revealed his next game, Haunted Chocolatier, back in 2021. We've only had the odd development update in the years since, but this week, we have received another one — albeit one that confirms we're still going to have to wait a while.
Shared in a new blog post on the Haunted Chocolatier website, Barone stated that the Stardew Valley 1.6 update has been taking up most of his time of late (naturally), so his follow-up game has had to take a back seat. That said, he is still plugging away at the fantastical chocolate-maker sim in the meantime:

A wave of Splatoon 2 tracks landed on Nintendo Music this week, and we have been jamming along to the Splatfest sounds in the days since. However, it looks like the update contained a few more tracks than Nintendo intended, as a handful of them have since been removed.
Five tracks have been pruned this time — 'A Brighter Future Awaits! (Grizzco recruitment video)', 'January 2017 trailer', 'Bonus Track (After Octo)', 'Splatocalypse (Final Splatfest Trailer)' and 'Inkopolis Memorial Mixtape' — all of which, according to OatmealDome on BlueSky, were previously released exclusively on the Japanese soundtrack CD.

While Mai unfortunately missed out on joining Nintendo's all-star brawler, one game she will make a cameo in is Capcom's Street Fighter 6. A new DLC trailer dropped today and many fans are convinced there's dialogue in it that is a reference to Sakurai's famous comment about the SNK and Fatal Fury character.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["Half Witcher, half Game of Thrones".
While we're used to delays around this time of year, it's not often a game gets moved forward, and that's exactly what's happening with the graphic hack 'n' slash sequel Tails of Iron 2: Whiskers of Winter.
Although it was previously announced for a February 2025 launch window, it's now officially been shifted to the first month of the year and is scheduled to arrive on 28th January 2025. Digital pre-orders have also gone live for $24.99 USD, with a Deluxe Edition including the base game, and two DLC (Augur of the Draugr Pack and the Hair to the Throne Pack) priced at $29.99.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Update: The new release date has been confirmed.
Developer Summitsphere has announced that its upcoming Wario Land-inspired platformer Antonblast will be further delayed on the Nintendo Switch.
Although the game is still scheduled to launch on Steam on 3rd December 2024, it's been determined that the Nintendo Switch version simply isn't quite up to scratch. In a social media announcement, director Tony Grayson said "We need more time to make sure that this version of the game is running at peak performance and meeting our own high standards, as well as Nintendo's".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I think It’s safe to say that Trigger Happy Interactive’s upcoming survival horror Total Chaos is a bit of a palette change from their last offering - the frenetic, neon-drenched, chainsaw-legged Turbo Overkill. Still, it’s not often we see psychological horror combined with ultraviolence, and anything that gives off even a whiff of Condemned: Criminal Origins has my attention.
Total Chaos started life as a popular Doom 2 mod, and while I dare the say the limitations of that game sell the atmosphere a little better than this much sleeker update, I certainly trust Trigger Happy enough to make the most of the new engine. The game is set in New Oasis, a “once bustling haven for coal miners” that is now most definitely not bustling, nor haven-like.

While it was formally revealed for PC and Xbox around a year ago, developer Jump Over the Age and publisher Fellow Traveller popped up at this weekend's PC Gaming Show to announce that Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector will also launch on the Switch. What's more, it's been given a release window of early 2025.
If the title hasn't given it away already, this is a follow-up to 2022's excellent tabletop-inspired RPG Citizen Sleeper. Like its predecessor, Starward Vector will see you playing as an android (Sleeper) on the run from the company that made you. You'll have to commandeer a ship, build up a crew and carry out as many tasks as possible before your decaying body halts your progress. A nice, stress-free experience, then...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nightdive, you done good. The Thing: Remastered is an ultra-sharp and commendably playable update to a game that history will remember as ‘actually a pretty good pick at Choices when you really just popped in to get some Revels but got embarrassed when the till staffer said “is that everything?” in a tone that could have been neutral but equally could have been a damning indictment of your character’.
I’m being slightly facetious here, of course. History actually remembers Computer Artworks’s 2002 shooty horror game for how incredibly ambitious and conceptually inventive its proto-sus social squad system was. In homage to the body-snatching alien paranoia of Carpenter’s 1982 horror classic, The Thing tasks you with not just assembling and directing a squad, but keeping them from breaking down or turning on you - in fear you might be hosting the titular molecular stowaway.

Nightdive Studios' The Thing: Remastered has been sitting on a 2024 release date for a while now, and while a post from the developer yesterday confirmed that it will definitely be coming in December (it is the last month of the year, after all), an Xbox Wire line-up might have given us an even more specific date (thanks to our pals at Pure Xbox for the heads up).
Titled 'Next Week on Xbox: New Games for December 2 to 6', the Xbox Wire post lists Nightdive's remaster with a 5th December release date for Microsoft's latest consoles and Game Pass. Now, this is yet to be confirmed by the developer and there's obviously no guarantee that the Switch version will arrive on the same day, but this certainly seems like a real possibility.

Perhaps surprisingly, most video game houses do not shapeshift. Despite being made out of pure imagination and carbon emissions, they remain nostalgically shackled to the limitations of brick, mortar and Euclidean geometry. Blue Prince’s abode is different. It is a house made of house. You’ll actually design the layout yourself every time you wander through it, picking from a selection of mismatched room types whenever you open a door.

The latest to do so is ‘brinepunk’ FPS Abyssus, which seems to have mostly arrived at the terms by being ‘a bit Steampunk, but underwater’. Abyssus looks cool, and so with the power vested in me by the Greggs vegan sausage roll I had for lunch today, I hereby declare that this is the last game allowed to do this.

Actually, I’d say it feels like it precisely around February 2nd of this year. Well, would you look at that. It seems making excellent RPGs isn’t Jump Over The Age’s only skill. They’ve also predicted the exact release of their game to within a 3 day margin of error: the actual release date is the 31st of January, 2025.

If you, personally, are reading RPS while falling off a mountain at this very moment, I’m afraid I can’t help you. Luckily, if you bonk your head on Steam on the way down, you’ll find a demo for stylish open world climbing game Cairn, which should hopefully distract you from your imminent pancaking.
Cairn is from The Game Bakers, of Furi and Haven fame. We first saw it at the Day Of The Devs this year. I was fresh off the lovely Jusant at the time. “Ah, another relaxing and whimsical French game about mountain climbing!” I thought. I was a fool. It’s far more intense, this one, although there are dashes of Breath Of The Wild and Death Stranding to add some whimsy and wonder to your Sisyphean struggle. Plus, it's very pretty. Here’s some new footage, or possibly some old footage depending on badly the embargo has messed up my schedule.

It's been years now since Nintendo opened the eShop floodgates and started letting everything in. In stark contrast to the Wii U days when even established developers had trouble getting their games on Nintendo platforms, the weekly update is now filled with games that would have been unthinkable just one console generation ago.
For all my moaning to come, I'll make it clear up front that I'm not advocating going back to those dark days - the breadth and quantity of experiences you can download from the eShop is one of the great strides forward Nintendo made this gen. The problem that needs addressing is one of content management in an overcrowded storefront; for every promising-looking game and genuine gem, there are five cynical, bottom-of-the-barrel releases obscuring it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of my favourite anime shows is Sakura Quest. It's the story of an unemployed lady from Tokyo who accidentally gets herself appointed "Queen" of a struggling backwater village by the regional tourist board. From that case of mistaken identity proceeds 25 whole-ass episodes of Machiavellian haggling with crusty bigwigs over things like organising a concert. It's playfully dull, heartily mundane entertainment. No supernatural flourishes here - just the magic of paperwork and the thrill of bureaucracy.


I'm reminded of Sakura Quest by Danchi Days, a forthcoming cosy adventure with irresponsibly enticing Game Boy Advance-style visuals. It casts you as Hoshino, a teenage girl who's just moved to an old "danchi" housing complex and is trying to revive the yearly tradition of a summer festival. How will she do this? By means of haggling - haggling, and a bit of CSI.

If you’ve recently played Mario & Luigi: Brothership, then chances are you might have noticed something rather familiar with its opening cutscene. That is, of course, if you’ve also seen The Super Mario Bros. Movie from Nintendo and Illumination.
You see, both the game and the movie feature our favourite platforming siblings hurtling through a portal, desperately clinging onto each other before ultimately being torn apart and flung into different locations.

Geopolitics are fractious and unnerving, environmental catastrophe seems more likely each day, and rampant digitally-disseminated disinformation further erodes our trust in one another. But I'll let lesser reporters tell you about that stuff. I'm here to report that Capcom have made the big bonk feel good again. They’ve heard player feedback on the missing weapon oomph caused by the lack of hitstop in the Monster Hunter Wilds beta, and they’re bringing back the bonk.
Here’s a handy breakdown of the issue by X user Blue Stigma, but briefly: hitstop is the brief pause in an attack animation the moment the weapon connects with an enemy, giving you a real sense of bonkitude and making say, a hammer feel different from a dagger.

I knew from some trailers that it was a free-to-play game about collecting pretty dresses and exploring a relentlessly positive open world. In those respects, I was correct.
I'd just missed the really big part - the fact it's a pacifistic Genshin Impact wearing a pretty dress. And as that realisation sunk in for the first time, my heart also sank with it. I really tried, I mean really tried to get into Nikki's gacha offerings; to delight in its menagerie of menus and cash in countless currencies for fun socks or glitzy tiaras. Sadly, I won't be logging back in ever again.

"RPS have never steered us wrong before!" they said, thus cementing our reputation as the most selflessly heroic gaming website, seven years running. What we can’t take credit for, however, is the 1.2 million quid they’ve raised already. If you want to make that number bigger, you can pick up the bundle here, and get 19 Steam keys for your trouble with a minimum donation of £35.
19 is such an annoying number in terms of the page layout that I’m almost convinced to never give to charity again, but there are some very nice games, including the aforementioned Shadows Of Doubt, Dungeons And Degenerate Gamblers, Citizen Sleeper, Another Crab’s Treasure, Two Point Campus, and Deathsprint 66.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I downloaded Creeper World IXE's demo, I had it pegged as a bizarre original. It is, in fact, the latest in a series of real-time strategy games in which you position turrets and terraform maps to repel surging, simulated tides of purple liquid. This is a war between flesh and mineral, solidity and fluidity that dates back to the age of Gillen. Alex Wiltshire (RPS in peace) interviewed creator Virgil Wall back in 2019 - amongst other things, we learn that the original Creeper World was based on a "failure" - and Sin has an  enthusiastic piece from 2021 about Creeper World 4, the first 3D instalment.
What does Creeper World IXE bring to the party? Well, 1) it ain't 3D, and 2) it's billed as an exercise in "dominating" the titular Creeper, rather than keeping it at bay. For too long has this sloshing, coruscating hooligan been allowed to wash over and corrode our precious starports. We will take the fight to it in the shape of an upgradeable 2D starfleet, equipped with lasers we can use to chisel away the geography and re-rout the flow of villainous Vimto.

It's boring because it's a "solved game" whose outcomes can be safely predicted regardless of where you place your first nought or cross, allowing the "perfect" player to at least draw their opponent. It gets played regardless because a lot of people don't know it's a solved game - specifically, young children you may wish to humiliate using your superior grown-up brain, because when you were a child somebody did the same to you. 
How many twisted adults were born from the experience of being bullied via the medium of tic-tac-toe? We'd be better off without this game. But look! Here comes Tic Tactic to shake things up with a touch of Balatro.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[“If, two months ago, you’d been told to close your eyes and imagine a Two Point game about a museum, you’d come up with something at least 85% identical to Two Point Museum,” wrote James, previewingishly. After spending a few hours with a beefier build, I’m inclined to agree. But, much like Campus (which gave you real incentive to actually run a smooth operation that genuinely benefited the lazy ratbags stinking up your dorm halls) it’s that extra 15% that really makes all the difference.
James already covered the new exhibits system, and how acquiring and displaying them changes the way you run things, but such globetrotting adventures do little to rattle the pulse of a world-weary mapmuncher like me. No, what I’m actually most excited for when Two Point Museum releases next February is possibly the most ostensibly uninteresting feature added to any videogame ever - partition walls.

Heart Of The Machine is a cyberpunk 4X strategy game that will let players choose how a newly awakened AI sentience might behave once set loose upon a big future city. Developers Arcen Games call it a "turn-based sci-fi 4X RPG", which is a lot of genres fighting for supremacy in one small phrase. It was announced last year, but today it gets a release date and an updated demo.

The real time strategy games will no longer be available to buy on the storefront from the 13th of December, but GOG have released a statement committing to maintaining and updating the games for existing owners as part of their preservation program. If you don’t own them already, they’re also currently on discount as a bundle.
"We’re deeply saddened to share the news that Warcraft: Orcs and Humans and Warcraft II will leave our store on December 13th, 2024,” wrote GOG on X. "Seeing these masterpieces leave our store is tough, but it also serves as another reminder of why our mission at GOG is so important.

"But hold your horses, young Edwin," you sternly interject. "I do not wish to hear about, let alone play an open world survival shooter that is both fuelled and plagued by piss, on a website that children might read. It sounds like a cheap, taboo-jabbing gimmick." Friend, I once thought as you. But then I did a little research, as is my journalistic responsibility, and it turns out Urge's notions about piss - bladdergold, as they call it in the West Country, or Crusoe Cola, as it's known in the States - are rather in-depth. I'm still very glad I can't smell the game, but I definitely have the urge to play it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Anyone with the need for a new CPU and even the slightest inclination towards tech envy is currently waiting for new stock of the AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D, the unbeatably powerful new chip that our boffin friends at Digital Foundry are calling the fastest gaming CPU ever. If, however, you’re hoping to switch to the 9800X3D from an older system with DDR4 RAM, you’ll need to upgrade that as well as the motherboard, as the entire Ryzen 9000 series only works with newer DDR5 memory.
Cyber Monday won’t help materialise more processors into retailers’ warehouses, but it can help you make this RAM switch on the cheap. Relatively speaking. And I can recommend a nice, fast 32GB kit of Corsair Vengeance DDR5, which is down by £43 in the UK and $22 in the US.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While Mechabellum’s disparate roster of roast ’em riddle ‘em robots might initially seem to lack the characterful coherence of a writhing Zerg ecosystem or ancient Greek phalanx, this strategy autobattler’s array of lumbering tanks, hulking automata, and zippy fliers do share a common thread: each one of them has the potential to be either the most terrifying nuisance on the field, or to instantly crumble like a soggy strudel in an angry washing machine. With each mech able to become another mech's worse nightmare, it becomes a game about stretching tight budgets to balance reactive counters with devastating offensives; about identifying the butterfly wings that can send tornados through your opponent’s ranks. It’s about the moments that eat up the hours like nothing else.

"Nowhere is safe from having its economy meticulously managed in minute detail by discerning comrades," explains the announcement release. I for one welcome our new socialist overlords.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There is some spiteful drama in the Half-Life modding scene this week. The developers of a heavily criticised mod for Half-Life 2 are intentionally blocking a small number of YouTubers from playing that mod, using Steam IDs to effectively blacklist and ban specific people from running it. Instead of launching the game as expected, these players will see the first-person shooter crash, alongside an error message that reads: "STOP talking SH1T about us". This is an act of revenge for previous criticism of the mod, say the affected videofolks, who are described in the mod's code as "anticitizens".

Yuck. If there’s one type of design that deserves the accolade, though, it’s RPGs that are assured enough in the richness of their worlds to not feel the need to signpost every discovery.
It’s a feedback loop of charitable feelings: the game is saying "we think you’re smart enough to find this stuff on your own". "You’re right!" you respond. "I am smart! And anyone who recognises that must be one smart cookie". Joy abounds, it rains Tunnock’s Caramel Wafers, hedgehogs jig gracefully in the street, and all is right with the world. So, I must say, I’m quite pleased to hear Avowed’s environment region director Berto Ritger sing the virtues of missable content to GamesRadar.

Glancing over that map as a newcomer to the game, my eye was caught by the creator's casual mention that Caves Of Qud is technically 2,147,483,646 levels deep.
"Is Caves Of Qud really 2,147,483,646 levels deep?" I asked Brendy, like a wide-eyed child asking whether there is such a thing as dog heaven. Brendy wasn't sure. (About Caves Of Qud, I mean, not dog heaven.) So I put the question to one of the developers, Freehold Games co-founder Brian Bucklew. In brief, the answer is yes, but with some significant caveats.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the many high concept ludonarrative experiments I’d one day like to bring to fruition is an immersive sim in which the player has access to many guns, but their default arsenal selection is an open packet of crisps which they hold out in front of them, in first person, and offer to NPCs. Some NPCs wouldn’t be swayed by this, but some would lower their weapons at the offer of a prawn cocktail treat, and so you’d be constantly playing chicken with various guards: edging closer toward them, your shaking hands rattling the delicious disks inside the oily packet, mentally weighing up whether it's worth risking them turning hostile at the last second.
Obviously, I’d scan some real crisp packets and just alter the logos for maximum immersion. One game that’s already taken this scanned bricolage concept and run with it to beautiful effect is Hyperdrive Inn. It’s an avant garde point and click adventure from Finnish studio Horsefly, where the entire world is constructed from scanned fabric samples. Have a looksee.

But man, it’s hard work making these chocolates. Too much manual labour. I wish we could automate the process somehow - perhaps we just need to exploit the planet’s resources and turn it into a giant chocolate-making factory spanning the entire solar system. Yes, that should work.

Just an endless cycle of microSD cards, mice, microSD cards, mice. At least it’s a good'un, though - the best Steam Deck-compatible microSD of them all, in fact. Previously, its one weakness was the lack of a truly cavernous 1TB model, but that was amended earlier this year, and now that capacity is getting its first major saving as part of Black Friday 2024.

This is easier to shrug off while it's still in early access, but I will confess some relief when I read that the Trese Brothers (It's pronounced "Trese") nudged their estimated release date back to 2025. It needs a bit longer. But I'm about ready to start recommending it.
I'm a tad biased by my love for their previous Star Traders Colon Frontiers, an interest in mercenary management, and a wish for more turn-based tactics games that aren't bloody XCOM again. That I have reservations about what CKF hasn't yet nailed down is in part a symptom of high expectations. And because despite carrying over some design ethos from Frontiers, Cyber Knights is a very different kind of game.

Released in 2008, it's part of the fine tradition of post-Gears double-A actioners that basically consist of taking a gruff man, throwing him into a world of grit, gravel and burning oil drums, and handing him a murderous gimmick. Dark Sector's gimmick was the glaive, a pointy boomerang you could use to scoop up objects, solve puzzles, and kill stuff in third-person view.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To be clear, I still think the best graphics card deal of Black Friday week is that RTX 4070 Super offer and oh no wait that one’s gone now. But even if hadn’t been ecommerced to death, there’d still be a way to get the upgraded ray tracing and DLSS 3 frame gen tools of the RTX 40 series for less cash still: plucky 1080p contender, the RTX 4060, whose deals are still very much available and kicking.
In the UK, the best available prices are for the MSI GeForce RTX Ventus 2X Black edition, which is the partner card I happen to own myself – and has become the effective go-to GPU for RPS game performance tests. Over in the US, meanwhile, the Gigabyte GeForce RTX 4060 Gaming OC is the most affordable of all; it’s a chunkier design than that of the compact Ventus 2X, though that’s mainly just the tradeoff for having an extra fan. These cards were already on the cheaper end of the RTX 4060 spectrum, and now they’re £30 / $35 off in the sales. Bargain.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As far as Black Friday deals go, the Logitech G502 Hero isn’t so much low-hanging fruit as it is a root vegetable. Every year, this damned multi-buttoned mouse goes on sale, and every year, I’m powerless to avoid writing about it. Can’t even be bothered to take a different header image photo. It’s partly your fault, you know. You like it too much.
This time it’s down from £80 to £26 in the UK (£27 outside the Bezos Empire), which isn’t quite an all-time low, but is pretty close – and a silly-good price for such a capable mouse in any case. Its US discount price of $35 ain’t half bad either, though I notice Amazon US is shouting louder about knocking the newer G502 X down from $80 for $45. That’s mostly a fine mouse as well, though I find its redesigned scroll wheel a bit too much on scratchy side. Of the two, I’d stick with the classic.

The first-person shooter, which is replete with satisfying explosions, gunfire, bullet ricochets, smashing glass, sparks, goo, blood spatters, dust, ice particles, smoke, flecks of plaster, and bad guys yelling at one another about how she's over there, may be described as noisy, both in the aural and visual sense of the word. Which is how we like it, you understand. This latest update to the early access shooter leans into that by layering on even more juicy shootFX. It also adds a whole new game mode and plenty of other tweaks. The bad news is that some story bits are now delayed.

Doubly so in the wake of The Callisto Protocol - a game I still think is worth picking up on a deep discount, if you like hitting gross things with a big bit of metal. It’s quite exciting, then, to learn that the next game from Lies Of P developer Round 8 Studios might just replace that severed limb. Alongside a sequel to the puppety soulslike, they’re also working on a sci-fi survival horror game, via Eurogamer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Palestinian developer Rasheed Abueideh has announced Dreams On A Pillow, a mixture of stealth-adventure and interactive documentary set during the Nakba - Israel's violent displacement and dispossession of Palestinian Arabs in 1948, shortly after Israel's founding. Created by "a global team of veteran game developers", it's the story of a Palestinian woman grappling with the loss of her baby after fleeing a bloody assault on her town.

Yet they’re also both very good at what they do, and are now sharing Black Friday discount honours.

Rather than do the usual routine of just suggesting the WD Black SN850X again, however, there’s no better SSD-for-yer-money deal right now than the Crucial T500, which is going for an exceptionally low £58 right now for the 1TB capacity – down from £120. The 2TB version is also an excellent buy at £100, and there are decent offers up for grabs in the US too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Okay okay, just one more handheld deal then I’ll look at some desktop stuff. But here’s a properly chunky Black Friday discount on the most endearingly out-there Steam Deck rival to date, the Lenovo Legion Go: the 512GB model has shed hundreds of pounds/dollaridoos to fall all the way to £479 / $500. That’s really not a lot for something that goes full luxe on its display and build quality, not to mention its party trick of letting the two controller sections split off, Nintendo-switch style, with one acting as a portable mouse.
This is also the cheapest that the Legion Go has ever gone, at least in the UK, so could make a good pickup if you’ve been wanting something with more power than the Steam Deck range but have been put off by the Legion Go or Asus ROG Ally X’s high launch pricing.

It's small in scope, for one, but also VR would let you see through the eyes of the tooter and slide your trombone note up and down by holding the motion controllers up to your face.

So it is in Trombone Champ: Unflattened, a VR spin-off that's out now.

Discounts are definitely never a bad thing, but Steam sales used to feel like big events on the PC gaming calendar. They don't anymore, to me. Friends, are Steam sales still exciting to you?

Perhaps seeking to wash away any lingering bad karma, Ndemic have now unveiled After Inc: Revival, a blend of city builder and miniature 4X set in the aftermath of a zombie apocalypse. In Plague Inc, you brought the world to an end; now, you must grow it anew from the wreckage.

But what if you could not only survive it, but tame it?
I am Bohdan Beastmaster, aspiring wrangler of all the radiation-twisted insults to God that occupy the Zone. One of its rogue Artifacts exploded my flat, and rather than find a place on SpareRoom, I’ve gone for the easier and safer option of venturing into the wilds of Chornobyl – armed not with rusty AKs or scavenged grenades but the teeth and claws of my mutant soon-to-be companions. The absence of any actual fauna-influencing tools or techniques only makes my plan even simpler: find beasts, aggro beasts onto human enemies, win.

The operation eventually drew an audience of millions but, in true drama fashion, announced its own demise this week. The site's operators cite 'copyright' as the reason and recent domain name troubles and pressure from Hollywood studios likely played a role.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The genre of 'Action RPG' is supremely annoying to write about, because the term can mean different things to different people, but here’s how I see it: Diablo 4 and similar games, such as Path Of Exile, are 'ARPGs'. Which stands for 'Action RPG'. But Zelda games are 'Action RPGs', which is a totally different genre that you could, if you felt like it, also shorten to 'ARPG'. So, to summarise: ARPGs and ARPGs are two different things, and both are Action RPGs. Got it? Great.
It’s because of this kerfuffle that I’m not exactly mad at Diablo boss Rod Fergusson recently suggesting that we just call games that are similar to Diablo 'Diablo-likes'. I just find it very funny that he’s the one saying it, in a bold faced act of admittedly very inconsequential linguistic colonialism that carries the unspoken connotation that something is "like the game I make, but a bit crap".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in January I wrote a (supporters only) post about how tired I am of all survival games starting off the same. Here's the gist of it: I've had enough of gathering rocks and sticks to make a crafting bench, from which I'm forced to build a hut and so on. I'm sure for some this is riveting, but for me, it's something I tire of within seconds.
And so it's with a heavy heart I say that Towers Of Aghasba suffers from the same starting gamut of sticks and stones. There's a hint of some interesting ecosystem stuff springing up a bit later, and judging by the trailers, an ability to clamber on massive flying creatures made of what looks like elephant skin and hair. Still, I just can't do it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've gone on record as not being a huge fan of the artstyle choices used in the new Warcraft I & II remasters. It's crisp and readable, sure, but I'm never exactly thrilled to see all the roughness of older sprites completely done away with, especially when I always felt some of that ruggedness was the point. The tendency of remasters to treat every characterful oddity as a blemish is a wider topic than the scope of this article, but one day, Bluepoint will remaster Bloodborne, and the world will feel my pain. 
Anyway. Nowadays, I'd say Blizzard - or, World Of Warcraft, at least - is pretty much synomous with a softer, more colorful approach to fantasy worlds. While I don't pine for a return to the more boobily ridiculous elements of Frank Frazetta's style, I do often wish that some of the more expressive, pained, and physically grounded elements of classic Sword And Sorcery art was a bit more common. I'm no art scholar, and there's undoubtedly a bit of tunnel vision of my part to this assertion, but as far as as pop culture goes: I see the Blizzard version of fantasy more than I see the Frazetta version, and I don't exactly love it. Same goes for the older, punkier, less uniform sci-fi art from things like 2000 AD and Warhammer 40,000. Edwin touched on some of this in his excellent Space Marine piece. 
Anyway, a valued RPS community member on the Discord shared an older bit of art by Blizzard's Chris Metzen, from the original Starcraft manual. I figured a few of you might enjoy seeing these older pieces, considering how much the overall look of their games has changed over the years.

There is indeed a factory and it does indeed produce cabins - jolly, Center Parcs-style affairs made of big, merry logs, which roll up fully constructed on a conveyor belt. Your job is to enter and inspect them in first-person. What are you inspecting them for? Ghosts.

I might be conflating billionaires here.
Also, coincidentally, all things you can do in the demo for Beff Jezos Simulator. Now, work simulation games aren’t my absolute favourite. But, hey, I do love a good fantasy game.

CEO Swen Vincke did, however, caveat that while the overall level of post-release support would be "diminished", there would be a few more updates. We interpreted that to mean bug fixes and the like. Certainly, I wasn't expecting brand new subclasses for every class in the game, which is what you'll get with the just-announced Baldur's Gate 3 patch 8, together with new crossplay functionality and a full-figured photo mode.

That game began as a PICO-8 prototype by designer Jakub Wasilewski before being polished to a fine shine in its full release.

All of which is just lead-in to talking about Solitomb, a solitaire-based dungeon crawler in which you fight demons by building hands of playing cards. It's currently - heywaitaminute - a pay-what-you-want PICO-8 prototype by designer Jakub Wasilewski where "all money earned goes towards making the bigger version possible." Like Slipways, it already seems like a frightfully clever piece of design.

Now there's a demo, and it's substantial with a tutorial, a 10 stage rally, and three "ever-changing Daily Stages with online Steam leaderboards."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[System requirements are on the rise, and a glut of recent PC facepunchers has left some of the RPS treehouse wondering if it’s time for a graphics card upgrade. Being a helpful colleague and a handsome friend, I dutifully informed them that the highly capable Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 Super is currently getting the Black Friday price cut treatment, with Zotac’s Twin Edge model dropping especially low in both the UK and US. Still, dear readers, if you feel like punishing us for that comment system switch, you could always head over to Amazon and buy up all the stock yourself.
$590 is a decent deal for a model that’s spent most of the past few months at $610, but us Brits are getting the better bargain here - even if it’s not for the OC version. £500 means a hefty £49 slasheroo, the deepest discount this card has seen yet, and you’ll also get a key for Indiana Jones and the Great Circle to play when it releases on December 9th.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's often claimed by liars and fools that our website's title is a clever reference to the ancient Chinese game of shoushiling - or "rock paper scissors", as it's known overseas. The orthodox interpretation is that "Rock Paper Shotgun" is a folksy regional variation on this, with a "shotgun" instead of the "scissors". But friends, this is patently absurd. Think about it: a game that pits a shotgun against a rock or piece of paper would be incredibly one-sided. It goes against reason!
The sad reality is that the origins of our website's title have been deliberately obscured, allowing cold hard fact to slither back into legend. Behind that mockingly nonsensical moniker sleeps an eldritch truth of such gravity it would make Gandalf spill his mead. Friends, the Rock Paper Shotgun is real. The Weapon exists. Or at least, it once did - and will, for I mean to fashion it anew by combing the writing of RPS writers gone by for raw materials. And in this endeavour, I will naturally need your aid.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We've been working for a while on the next ScummVM release, and it is time for a call for public testing.
Support for a number of new engines and games for the existing ones was added, and we need your special attention to the following titles:
Orion Burger.
Total Eclipse and Total Eclipse 2.
Thimbleweed Park.
The Space Bar.
Moonbase Commander. (with multiplayer support)
Backyard Basketball.
Unrest.
Rise of the Dragon.
Castle Master.
Wait for it! Issue 3. Song for a Hare. (Ну, погоди! Выпуск 3. Песня для зайца)
Mask Show. (Маски-шоу)

A detailed list of all exciting new features and fixes is available in our NEWS file.
We are looking forward to your reports about successful and unsuccessful playthroughs and bugs reported!

Existuje vícero českých filmů, které surfují na oblíbené vlně "zakažte exekutory, zrušte dluhy, je to nelidské!" (například Tancuj Matyldo). After Party takovým filmem není. Exekutoři se v něm chovají korektně a slušně a vinu na situaci celé rodiny nese naprosto jednoznačně otec, který neopatrně investoval, i když nevíme jak. A "nevíme jak" je téma, prolínající se celým tímto filmem. Takže nevíme, co vlastně otec komu naslibova…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Castle Master, the haunting conclusion to the Freescape engine saga, is now ready for public testing!
Prepare yourself for a perilous adventure as you lower the drawbridge to enter the Castle Master’s domain. Released in 1990 by Incentive Software, Castle Master became popular for its technical innovation and challenging gameplay. The game inspired countless 3D adventure titles, and the Freescape engine itself marked a technological milestone, enabling groundbreaking object interaction and spatial puzzles.
Notably, Castle Master was one of the first games to let you choose to play as either a prince or a princess, offering a different experience depending on your choice.
Your mission: rescue your twin, imprisoned within the eerie depths of Castle Eternity by the evil Magister. This sprawling, foreboding castle is filled with traps, monsters, and puzzles blocking your path. Gather items, unlock doors, and solve complex riddles as you navigate the labyrinthine halls and confront the dark forces within.
This modern reimplementation showcases enhanced graphics using OpenGL, with initial support for the DOS and ZX Spectrum releases. If you’re eager to embark on this dark journey, a playable demo is available to test your tenacity.
To participate in the testing, ensure you have a daily development build. We encourage all players to submit feedback and bug reports through our issue tracker.
Will you brave the creepy corridors of Castle Eternity and free your sibling, or will you fall victim to the Magister’s curse and join his army of enslaved spirits? The adventure awaits!
