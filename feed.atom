Mini video game consoles might not be quite as popular with publishers as they were a number of years ago, but one company that's still a fan of this idea is Sega. As you might have heard, it's just released its second Mega Drive Mini / Genesis in limited stock around the world.
If you are interested in seeing more of Sega's "mini" systems in the future, you could be in luck. A digital survey included with Mega Drive Mini 2 purchases asks players what other miniature systems they would like to see in the future (via @gosokkyu on Twitter).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[And I could not be more excited
Slay the Spire is one of my most-played games of all time, so it's always a pleasant surprise to see the little indie game that could from 2017 in the headlines. This time, there's a Slay the Spire board game in the works, and in all honesty, I'm not much of a board game person, but I am willing to be if it means I get to play a physical version of my favorite deckbuilding roguelike.
Apparently I somehow missed the announcement that Slay the Spire was getting a board game adaptation two years ago, but the Kickstarter page for the project is officially launched. So far they've raised over $1.5 million, and I don't really have any clue how much money it takes to make a board game, but that seems like a pretty substantial chunk of change in my book.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGfSp3Kz7rk
There are four pledge tiers ranging from $1 to $210 -- the lowest tier gets you access to updates and the Pledge Manager at the end of the campaign, the $100 tier gives you the base game, the $145 version gets you the base game plus some extras like character play mats and metal coins, and that fancy $210 version gets you the game and a whole bunch of extras, like the aforementioned mats, coins, and some beta art, among other things.
There are already some reviews of the board game up online, and with all the little bits and baubles (that I am bound to lose) it seems that the mechanics are a very faithful adaptation of what we're used to seeing in the video game. It looks to me like a pretty luxe purchase for collectors and fans of the game, so I'd probably suggest giving the original a few runs before playing if you haven't already.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The days keep getting longer
Harvestella arrives on Nintendo Switch and PC this week. And ahead of launch, Square Enix is detailing some updates it made to Harvestella after getting feedback from the demo.
The Harvestella Switch demo went live on the eShop following the September Nintendo Direct. Players had feedback from it, it seems, and Square Enix is making some tune-ups in a day one update for Harvestella.
As the studio outlines in a new blog entry, one major point is longer days. Time seemed to fly by a bit in the Harvestella Switch demo, so this should hopefully make it easier to do a bit more while the sun's up.
Cooldowns for job switching have been sped up, so it's easier to change up in combat. And the Mage class will also strike a bit faster than before. There's also more warning when your character is low on HP.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dd3U4jQFovk
In one of my favorite notes, Square says fishing is more fun. Specifically, the hit time has been reduced. But I like the general notion of fishing being more entertaining.
The Harvestella day one update has also received some bug fixes, a new UI for saving and loading, and partially reduced load times. These are all coming in a day one update to Harvestella itself, but the demo will not be updated.
Home on the fantasy range
These all sound like solid tune-ups for Square Enix's fantasy farming adventure. Harvestella is the RPG company's take on farming life, a genre that's been seeing quite the resurgence.
The demo feedback route has worked out well for Square Enix in the past. Specifically, Triangle Strategy made a good few changes and tune-ups between its demo and launch that ultimately felt for the better.
We'll know soon enough whether the same has been done for this farming RPG. Harvestella goes live for Nintendo Switch and PC via Steam this Friday, November 4.

Remember when two of the most creative game producers and directors — Goichi Suda (Suda51 of No More Heroes fame) and Hidetaka ‘Swery’ Suehiro (creator of Deadly Premonition) got together and said they wanted to make a horror game together? That was way back in 2019, and while the pair have since reiterated that the game, Hotel Barcelona, is still on, there's not been a lot of movement. Until today.
VGC reports that trademarks for Hotel Barcelona were filed back on 25th March 2022 in Japan, and on 27th October this year internationally, though the latter is still pending. The trademarks were filed under Swery's company, White Owls, so we're hoping something is happening behind the curtain there!

Idea Factory International has announced that it's bringing the unique, adorable-looking 3D shooter Little Witch Nobeta to the West in the spring of next year. This new take on the third-person shooter, developed by Pupuya Games and Simon Creative, may look cute on the surface, but there are some frightening monsters lurking within the mysterious castle.
As Nobeta, an amnesiac witch, you'll be guided by a little black cat throughout this castle to find out what you're doing there while trying to regain your memories. Playing with an over-the-shoulder camera view, you'll need to explore every crevice while taking out monsters with your magic stave — and you don't just swing it either. Instead of using a gun or a bow, Nobeta can cast ranged magic from a distance.

Xbox has announced that 2021's strategy sim Dune: Spice Wars is headed to the PC Game Pass service — Shiro Games' take on Frank Herbert's iconic literary universe is currently available on PC via Steam Early Access, but should be made available to the paid subscription service in the very near future.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lFx4wfc8Tc
Dune: Spice Wars is a 4X real-time strategy set against the arid and isolated backdrop over the fictional planet Arrakis. Taking up control of one of many factions from the Dune universe, players compete for control of the planet and its lucrative "spice" reserve — a plant that forms the root of incredible powers, from extended human life to interstellar travel. Guide troops, establish refineries, balance resources, and deal with your fellow spice fielders by fair means... or foul.
Announced and released in the aftermath of Denis Villeneuve's epic live-action movie, Dune: Spice Wars returns the series to its strategic gameplay roots, as popularized by the extremely popular and genre-defining PC/Amiga release Dune II: Battle for Arrakis (1992). The new game received a major update this past summer, adding dedicated multiplayer servers, peer-to-peer support, new regions, events, and factions.
Heartbreakingly, There's no sign of Kyle Maclachlan, Batista, or Rebecca Ferguson, but Dune: Spice Wars still looks like a very fine time for ruthless, intergalactic entrepreneurs everywhere.

Ever since Nintendo came out with the marvellous Super Mario Maker and its immediate sequel, Nintendo fans have been frankly begging for something similar for the Legend of Zelda franchise.
Well, the unfortunate news is that we're probably not going to get anything Zelda-related anytime soon - beyond the experimental feature showcased in the Switch remake of Link's Awakening, anyway - but fear not, because developer Firechick is looking to bring something pretty similar to the Switch with Super Dungeon Maker.

The fabulous Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope might have only just come out a few weeks ago, but Ubisoft is already looking to the future. Today, the company has lined out what to expect from the game's Season Pass, with three DLC packs — including one Pass-exclusive one — coming to Switch in 2023.
It looks like there's plenty to look forward to in the galaxy, and it all starts early next year. Season Pass owners will get exclusive access to The Tower of Dooom, a spooky-themed level where Mario and friends must save Spawny, who is stuck inside Madame Bwahstrella's very messy multi-dimensional tower. Perhaps our office gets a little messy sometimes because it's multi-dimensional...? There's also a new combat mode, which promises "highly strategic battles".

QuByte Interactive has announced that it will be holding an open beta this weekend to test the online stability of its long-time-coming rerelease Breakers Collection. The test period will kick off on PC (via Steam on Friday, November 4, and will rock on for an as-yet-undisclosed amount of time, ahead of the title's January release.
Breakers Collection, as we have reported many times, is a compendium of two cult '90s fighters, Breakers and Breakers' Revenge, which was available in arcades and on the Neo Geo platform in the mid-1990s. The new rerelease features both games in their entirety, sporting modern-day technological boosts such as rollback netcode and crossplay support, as well as a range of cool new features including Team Battle Mode, Interactive Replays, online profiles, and a deep Training Mode.

If you want in on the beta beatings, then all you need do is wishlist Breakers Collection on Steam and download the beta client prior to the big server switch-on this Friday. While the Breakers titles struggled to find their feet alongside the Street Fighter Alpha series, as well as the then-influx of 3D fighters such as Tekken and Soulcalibur, there is no denying that the series has its own charm, and is still a fun and engaging 2D fighter even today, decades on from its initial release. This new release will provide the dedicated Breakers community with a much-needed official platform for the fighter's competitive scene.
Breakers Collection launches January 12, 2023, on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch. Physical editions are available to pre-order now exclusively at Strictly Limited Games.

Rather than getting worried about it, however, our round friend decides to live with it and make friends with it.

In what is one of the nicer, but extremely late giveaways in the Pokemon space: UK retailer GAME is allowing folks to pick up a free Shiny Eternatus code without going into the store.
As highlighted by Joe Merrick of Serebii.net fame, GAME now has a web form that you can simply fill out to gain access to the Pokemon in Sword and Shield. Here are the details on what you actually get:
"Shiny Eternatus will arrive in your game at Lv. 100 with a Timid Nature and the Pressure Ability. It’ll know the moves Dynamax Cannon, Eternabeam, Sludge Bomb, and Flamethrower, so it should make a powerful addition to your team!"

While the promo is technically suited for the UK region, and some users have noted that they are geo-blocked: others have been able to access it and utilize the email form. Note that you have until November 17 to take advantage (or until they run out), and you can tap someone you know in the UK if the site is giving you trouble.
How to get a free shiny Eternatus in Pokemon Sword and Shield
Just go here, and input your email!
The site indicates that you will not get GAME marketing emails: but rather, this form is just for the code.
Nintendo also provides re-iterated instructions on mystery gift redemption:
To claim your in-game gift, follow these steps:
Launch your Pokémon Sword or Pokémon Shield
Select Mystery Gift on the X menu.
Select Get a Mystery Gift.
Select Get with Code/Password to save your game and connect to the internet.
Enter your code or password.
Watch as the gift arrives in your game. (Pokémon will appear in your party or your Pokémon Boxes. Items will appear in your Bag.)
Be sure to save your game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Buckle my shoe.
Marriage isn’t always perfect. Sometimes, as here, two presumably decent, hard-working parents, whose relationship you know nothing about and whom you can afford only the most general human empathy, find the joy of matrimony fades. So they must support their daughter as they carefully share their decision to separate. However, in It Takes Two, the capital-T Talk doesn’t go exactly to plan, as dad and mum Cody and May are promptly plunged into a torturous hell, shrunk into freaky dolls by the magic tears of their crying daughter – whom we can only presume is a witch. Nonetheless, they seem inclined to return to her, rather than flee, and so begin an adventure from shed to garden to house. Like Rick Moranis on acid.
Following much game-o-sphere cheering and clapping last year – Game of the Year this, revolutionary that – It Takes Two has landed on Switch with its impressive commitment to co-op gaming. To be clear, there is no real way to play this game without a companion. It is essentially and only co-op, there is not a single set-piece or puzzle based on solo play. Cody and May are not two people optionally playing in the same space: the spaces are built in every way for their pairing. They’re nothing without one another, which of course rather leads the story. To try and play this on your own – apart from requiring virtuosic controller-juggling dexterity – would be rather tragic, if anything depicting your lonely struggles as starkly as it is supposed to depict companionship.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The cross-country road trip sets off in the new year
HBO has set a premiere date for The Last of Us. The series will debut on January 15 on HBO and streaming via HBO Max.
The show will follow the plot of Naughty Dog's video game The Last of Us, with Pedro Pascal playing the role of Joel and Bella Ramsey playing Ellie.
Naughty Dog shared the news today, alongside a promotional poster for the HBO series.
https://twitter.com/Naughty_Dog/status/1587837418748657665
The date seemingly leaked out a bit ahead of time, through the HBO Max streaming app. But now HBO and Naughty Dog have locked it in for the start of the new year.
We got a glimpse of the series in an HBO sizzle reel a while back, but more recently got a full teaser trailer, laying out the look and feel of HBO's take on The Last of Us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBRRDpQ0yc0
More PlayStation productions in the works
The Last of Us is far from the only PlayStation property with a silver-screen adaptation in the works. The Twisted Metal series has wrapped filming for Peacock, and the Gran Turismo film recently picked up Stranger Things' David Harbour for its cast.
Tack on reports of adaptations in the works, like Days Gone and Gravity Rush, and there's a lot of PlayStation in the pipeline. Which, depending on how you felt about the Uncharted movie, could be a good or bad thing.
But The Last of Us and HBO does seem like a perfect fit. The series is a dark take on the post-apocalypse and the choices humanity could make in it. Also, importantly, Nick Offerman is playing the role of Bill. That's pretty darn good casting.
HBO's The Last of Us adaptation premieres on January 15, 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The unreal shooter arrives early next year
Atomic Heart is locking in a date, after years of development and trailers. Mundfish's surreal shooter Atomic Heart will launch on February 21, 2023.
The first-person shooter has been in development for a few years, blending its BioShock influence with Soviet imagery and surreal surroundings. Every trailer for it has looked pretty fascinating though, as the magic and machinery mix to make something that looks unique, at the very least.
Mundfish dropped a new trailer today alongside the date. You can find that below:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3Iee7ZHHZE
The new FPS is slated to hit PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. It's also headed to Xbox Game Pass.
Right to the heart of it
Atomic Heart is about a society where humans live in peace with their robot companions and servants. Well, at least until something goes wrong and the robots, well, turn on them.
Now, mutated robots are turning on their creators, and your protagonist Major P-3 is sent in to "minimize consequences" and secure classified info.
It looks like this plays out in a very frenetic manner, as your newfound robotic foes are pretty lethal. So Major P-3 gets some tools of their own, wielding powers through a special glove to wreak havoc.
Atomic Heart has had my eye for a while, both for the influences its drawing on and the incredible art style Mundfish is crafting. I dig the surreal, dystopian retro-future the team has imagined. Although I could do with fewer clowns.
We'll see what the retro-future holds when Atomic Heart hits its launch date on February 21, 2023 for PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.

Many of my thoughts on Elden Ring have been positive, as I'm still awestruck by the quality and scope of its open world (among many other things). But I admitted I'd reached my exhaustion point, which abated briefly, then came back with full force by the end.
Honestly, as much as I admire the game and its brilliance, I reckon it might be a bit too much for me. And as FromSoftware set the Soulslike standard, I find myself hoping that future Soulslikes don't get too caught up in trying to mimick Elden Ring.

Activision has proudly announced that its recent release Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II has smashed all previous launch records held by the storied franchise, having raked in an incredible $800 million USD in sales over the course of its initial launch weekend.
Released on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms on October 28, Modern Warfare II immediately became the most successful entertainment product of 2022. Not only has the rat-a-tat-tat sequel beat out the Call of Duty franchise's own launch record — previously held by 2011's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 — but MWII has also surpassed the combined opening box office revenue of blockbuster movies Top Gun: Maverick and Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness.

Continuing the classic feel of Retro Bowl (a feature that earned the game 9/10 in our review), the upcoming title sees the world of 1990s video games brought back to the Switch, with everything playing out in crunchy 16-bit fashion.

Forever Entertainment has locked in a date for the first of its Front Mission remakes. Front Mission 1st: Remake hits Nintendo Switch on November 30.
Developer MegaPixel Studio and Forever Entertainment confirm the news today, with pre-orders opening on November 16.
Two more remakes are in the works as well. Forever Entertainment is also working on remakes of Front Mission 2 and 3. The former is set for 2023, while the latter is just arriving sometime in the future.
A new gameplay trailer for Front Mission 1st: Remake is arriving soon, too. The video will premiere less than 24 hours from this writing, on November 3. You can find it below when it's live:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvj7WerPPF8
Mecha tactics are back in season
Front Mission is a piece of Square's history that is exciting to see return. The strategic maneuvering of Wanzers around environments and big mech management makes it stand out a bit from the PlayStation 1 era of RPGs.
It's been a tactics-heavy year, too. Triangle Strategy started the year off strong, Tactics Ogre: Reborn is right around the corner, and a new Fire Emblem is just a few months away.
With three remakes currently set out, Front Mission 1st: Remake will get to set the tone for what's to come with these updated Front Mission titles. But hopefully it turns out strong. Front Mission is a neat series I've wanted to go back to for a while. Making these entries easily accessible, and putting them on the Switch at that, seems like a worthy endeavor.
Front Mission 1st: Remake hits Nintendo Switch on November 30.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CAUTION
Back in the day, folks used to rotate their palm on their Nintendo 64 controllers for Mario Party minigames, leading to injuries, and an official "glove" release from Nintendo. This time with the Mario Party 64 Switch re-releases (Mario Party 1 and 2) via the expansion pack, they're just adding that warning upfront.
Here's the warning in full for the first game, seen when booting it up:
"CAUTION: To avoid irritation to your skin and/or damage to the control stick, do not rotate it with the palm of your hand. Rotate the control stick with your thumb or by holding it between your thumb and forefinger."

The wild thing about this is that I always won these minigames, and never used my palm. Same thing with the button-mashing contests! Mario Party has caused a lot of folks strife over the past few decades, and this warning caused all those memories to come flooding back.
Here's two of my most memorable Mario Party experiences:
Someone refused to play minigames when they were on my team so that I would get less coins
After losing Totem Pole Pound, someone threw their controller across the room, which hit the N64 and froze the game
Fun times! On the flipside, I've played with a lot of good sports, and will continue to do so with these re-releases. Some of these original minigames just can't be beat, despite numerous attempts to bring them back from the dead in a new flavor.

I don’t envy the developers of puzzle games. They have to create puzzles formidable enough to be challenging and exciting, but not so much that the player feels more burdened than empowered. The best walk that line almost perfectly, and The Entropy Centre is chock full of them. But The Entropy Centre is more than its brain teasers, and it’s that “more” where the game hits its stumbling blocks. Despite that, its core design is unlike anything I’ve ever played, and genre enthusiasts will find that this game be…]]></summary>

This next-gen version of Nvidia’s DLSS upscaler not only boosts performance with render resolution trickery but also adds entirely new, AI-generated frames of its own, smoothing out visuals even further. Fewer than 40 games are confirmed to implement it so far but that number is growing, with Nvidia today announcing that Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales will include DLSS 3 when it launches for PC on November 18th.

Sony Interactive Entertainment has announced a launch date for its long-awaited PlayStation VR2 hardware (PSVR2) — The PS5 exclusive technology will launch globally February 22, 2023, priced at $550 USD / £530 GBP / €600. The set includes a PSVR2 headset, controllers, and stereo headphones.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5L9Mvh7tAk
Alternately, a Horizon: Call of the Mountain bundle will include the above set complete with a download code for an additional $50/£40/€50. Developed by Firesprite and Guerilla Games, Call of the Mountain is, as you would expect, a VR adventure set within the beautiful, but highly hazardous, futureworld explored in acclaimed adventures Horizon Zero Dawn (2017) and Horizon Forbidden West (2022). The PSVR2 system will have its own library of titles and is not compatible with previous PSVR releases.
If you're interested in picking up the flashy new technology which, to my knowledge, doesn't play Dactyl Nightmare, then pre-orders go live on the official PlayStation Direct store on November 15. SIE hints that not all orders will necessarily be served on launch day, with kits rolling out throughout the last week of February and into early March. For more details, visit the official PlayStation Blog.
These prices put the PS5 and PSVR2 kit somewhere in the region of $1000/£1000. I had some college.
PlayStation VR2 launches worldwide on February 22, 2023.

When developer Hazelight Studios launched It Takes Two back in March 2021 in partnership with Electronic Arts, it's safe to say that the co-op action-adventure title took everybody by surprise. By combining split-screen gameplay with a narrative that's both hilarious and poignant in equal measure, it struck a chord with gamers worldwide, going on to win several prestigious awards, perhaps most notably the Game of the Year gone at 2021's The Game Awards.
It seemed a no-brainer that the game would eventually make its way to the Switch, then, and it's certainly something that's been on the minds of the developers over at Hazelight Studios and porting studio Turn Me Up Games for quite a while.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Who would you be? I'd be 'The IBS Guy'
Square Enix, in association with developer Acquire, has released a new trailer for its charming-looking adventure sequel Octopath Traveler II. The surprisingly lengthy new preview, which you can check out below, introduces us to two members of the ensemble cast that will make up the game's multi-threaded narrative.
First up, we meet Partitio, or "The Merchant". This slick-tongued, noirish man is packed with the key weapons of wit and charisma, able to talk his way in and out of any sale, or even any situation. Curiously backed by some 1980's sitcom-sounding music, we see Partitio utilize his retail skills to trade with townspeople, hire assistants, and synergize with mercenaries in order to give himself the edge either on the market or in battle. Despite his capitalistic nature, Partitio is shown to have a streak of nobility.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUmdgkkYKkU
We are then introduced to the much darker character of Osvald, or "The Scholar". Wrongly imprisoned for the murder of his family, Osvald will escape the ice-cold incarceration of "The Frigid" in order to learn of the true events behind his wife and daughter's killing, (Although this trailer pretty much spoils it, good work, folks). As a studied individual, Osvald can scrutinize townspeople for secrets, and also study enemies in battle to learn their weak points and expose vulnerabilities.
In addition to the two new characters, the trailer also spotlights new travel options, with characters taking to the ocean by canoe, boat, or even a mighty ghost ship! All of Octopath Traveler II's characters will have a "Latent Power", (essentially a Limit Break), activated by building meter in battle. These unique abilities will help to turn the tide of battle in a pinch, so learn your characters' abilities and use them wisely.
Octopath Traveler II launches February 24 on PlayStation, PC, and Nintendo Switch platforms.

Since 1998, the Mario Party series has entertained gamers by mixing the play of traditional board games with frantic minigame action. There have been a great many entries over the years but this is one of the most warmly regarded and fondly remembered. Known for blister-creating rotate-the-stick minigames, Nintendo and developer Hudson Soft delivered a similar experience to the first game in this first sequel, only bigger and more impressive.

More specifically, the game will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on February 21, 2023. Developer Mundfish and publisher Focus Entertainment announced this news in a new and bloody gameplay trailer showcasing more of what to expect in the game early next year. 
Check out the Atomic Heart release date trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, Atomic Heart continues to look great in trailers and I can't wait to finally go hands-on with it in just four months, especially as a fan of BioShock. While Atomic Heart is doing its own thing, it's hard not to compare it to the BioShock series given the whole alternate reality thing, the types of guns on display here, the enemies we'll be facing, and the hand-controlled powers. 
Atomic Heart was revealed years ago, and there are plenty more trailers to watch if you're interested. Check out this 2020 gameplay trailer for an early look at the game, and then watch this 2021 trailer for a look at the creepier side of Atomic Heart.

It’s also the only Rusty Lake game so far to include 3D environments. You can snag a glimpse of the timey-wimey, multidimensional eeriness by watching the trailer below.

Both Mario Party and Mario Party 2 have rolled their way onto the Switch today thanks to the NSO Expansion Pack, bringing with them waves of party co-op nostalgia (and/or rivalry).
Aside from the minigames, music and those creepy character designs, for many of us one of the biggest memories of the original N64 title is the pain caused by rotating the Control Stick with the palm of your hand - hey, that boat isn't going to paddle itself. Fortunately, Nintendo has issued a warning which precedes the original Mario Party this time round, reminding us to rotate the control stick using our thumb, not our palm.

We love a good retro themed watch here at Nintendo Life and it looks like Casio G-Shock has come out with one of the most beautiful designs we've ever seen.
Shipping to customers from November 11th, 2022, the G-Shock X Super Mario Brothers DW-5600SMB-4 is based on the seminal platformer Super Mario Bros. for the NES, originally launched back in 1985. Its display features the typical Casio features, including a digital clock, date function, alarms, and other lovely bits and bobs, but the bezel itself displays an adorable pixel art green shell along with the 'Super Mario Bros. Casio' title at the top. As is the case with most Casio watches, this version will feature a backlight, but instead of the usual boring plain light, you'll be treated to a lovely little image of Mario along with the '1Up' logo.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As Replika Elster, Signalis will force you to untangle a mess of writhing flesh and malfunctioning memories to separate dream from lived experience. So, in keeping with dream logic: You’ve played Signalis before, and you’ve never played anything like it. It lovingly adopts the trappings of PS1-era survival horror, and more importantly, it fully understands why those systems, aesthetics, tropes, and technical limits are so engaging. But it also presents and explores love and loss, freedom and manipulation, fear and trauma, in its own cruelly captivating way. It’s strange and familiar, gorgeous and horrible. It’s an absolute banger of a videogame, made all the more impressive by its indiest of indies price tag and two-person dev team.
Fundamentally, it's a love story. Things go bad for space technician Elster, but she made a promise she intends to keep. We’ll get back to this later. First up: Signalis excels at capturing the essence of survival horror - those juxtaposed feelings of possibility and unease that hit you entering a long hallway, flanked by doors, only to find all but two locked or malfunctioning. You’ll be back here soon enough, you know that. Probably with a new key. Maybe with a new gun. But there’s also a good chance things will have…changed, by then. A floor tile might reveal new horrors. You might have spent your last bullet. So, left or right? Or maybe back? You can only carry six items, after all.

Tweeting his memories of working on the original game, Mitsuda revealed that a disagreement over what constitutes 'jazz' caused around 200 songs to be scrapped from the original soundtrack.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back to the Future
It might be time to polish those sunglasses and dig out that trenchcoat, as rumors abound this fine morning that cyberpunk RPG series Deus Ex is gearing up for a return. That's according to Bloomberg reporter Jason Schreier, who stated that the longtime developer is deep into its production cycle following its recent release from the Square Enix umbrella.
As reported yesterday, Schreier notes that Eidos Montreal is currently working on the franchise's new entry alongside several other titles, including a brand-new IP and several co-development projects with Xbox, such as a new release in the high-fantasy series, Fable. The Deus Ex release is said to be in its "very, very early" stages, so I wouldn't go expecting any announcements until at least later 2023, or perhaps even further down the line. Still, fans will be pleased to hear that the cult series has not been set adrift.
The first Deus Ex title launched on PC way back in 2000, spinning a typically cyberpunkian tale of capitalism gone wild and the nanotech-infused rebels who aim to bring the structure crashing down. While the acclaimed release was followed by several sequels of varying quality, it was the launch of the 2007 epic Deus Ex: Human Revolution that truly brought the series its mainstream success. The most recent game in the series is 2016's Deus Ex: Mankind Divided, which continued the franchise's penchant for complex action, deep narrative, and depressingly familiar political overtones.
Deus Ex: Mankind Divided is available now on PS4, PC, and Xbox One.

Konami has revealed its earnings report for the first six months of the year and the results aren't pretty. Despite the release of some titles with which we have had a lot of fun - Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection doing a lot of lifting on the 'some' there - the company reported a 34.4% drop in earnings.
This finding came courtesy of Kantan Games CEO @serkantoto, with the video game consultant noting that Konami's profits reflect the company's recent poor performance in the world of mobile apps - particularly those in the Yu-Gi-Oh! series.

It's able to outmatch some classic great value gaming CPUs, like the Ryzen 5 3600X and Core i5 11400F, and even comes close to the powerful (and more expensive) Core i5 11600K. All this with PCIe 5.0 and DDR5 support, given the right motherboard - and this is a surprisingly great way to jump on 12th-gen, while leaving plenty of space to upgrade to a higher tier CPU down the road.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This God of War: Ragnarok ad is the wildest thing I've seen in a while
Sony is known to go pretty full out to promote their games, and with the game's release just over a week away, they've pulled out all of the stops for God of War: Ragnarok. Their newest ad features none other than the likes of famed actor and director Ben Stiller dressed up as Kratos himself, alongside Lebron James and John Travolta.
The premise of the ad is that Kratos and Atreus father/son dynamic is something that all parents can relate to, and so Stiller is hosting a kind of God of War-themed parenting support group. He discusses his own struggles in relating to his son, and attempts to help James and Travolta connect with their children, too. By the way, those are actually all of their real children shown in the short, which is pretty cool if you ask me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQH0YK1rGVc
Kratos' newfound difficulties with fatherhood have been a meme since the first game in the God of War reboot series came out back in 2018, so it's a smart move for Sony to lean into that. Is it weird to see Ben Stiller in a Kratos outfit? Yeah. Am I confused as to why they chose Ben Stiller, Lebron James, and John Travolta of all people to be the faces of their marketing campaign for God of War? Absolutely. Is this whole thing kinda cringey? I'd say so.
At this point, they have to know that Ragnarok is going to be one of the biggest launches of the year, so at least Sony seems to be having fun with it. It's kind of a pet peeve of mine to see games taking themselves too seriously, so I still prefer this to some edgy skit about how God of War is going to redefine gaming or whatever.

The return of a classic adventure series is sailing for new ports next week. Return to Monkey Island arrives on Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5 on November 8.
While it originally launched for just PC and Switch, owners of newer consoles will also be able to finally return to the Monkey Island series. Additionally, Return to Monkey Island will be on Xbox Game Pass, for console alongside PC and cloud.
You can see the trailer for the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S versions here:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHYhubDqWCY
Return to Monkey Island first released in September for PC and Switch, and it seemed like it turned out pretty good. The story continues the journey of Guybrush Threepwood, as a new and dramatic series of events takes place on Mêlée Island.
Heading home
As Zoey wrote for us in the initial review, Return to Monkey Island is a follow-up to the series that's got a good amount of callbacks and references. For Monkey Island fans who haven't got around to it yet though, the new platforms provide a chance to finally check it out. And hey, Game Pass makes it easy to see if this kind of adventure is your cup of tea.
Return to Monkey Island joins a pretty stellar lineup of Game Pass games this month, too. Obisidian's historical murder-mystery Pentiment is also due up on the Pass. As is Somerville, the extraterrestrial thriller. And if you really just need to lose hours watching bats and skeletons explode, Vampire Survivors is on-deck too.
Return to Monkey Island hits PS5 and Xbox Series X|S on November 8.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Scissor Me
In what might be perhaps the single most niche emporium ever established, Japan will be getting a "pop-up shop" entirely devoted to the cult franchise Clock Tower. Situated in "The Akihabara Container" in Tokyo, the store will offer up a variety of exclusive goodies pertaining to the Gothic survival horror series.
The Clock Tower faithful can visit the location from November 3, rolling out fistfuls of Yen in order to bag merchandise based upon the original Clock Tower (1995) and its sequel Clock Tower 2: The Struggle Within (1998). Up for grabs will be mugs, keychains, wall scrolls, clothing apparel, standees, posters, and more, with the piece de resistance being an old-school alarm clock that plays the game's title theme!
Check out the goodies in the flyer below, courtesy of Famitsu and Siliconera.

The Clock Tower series combines classic point-and-click gameplay with the survival horror tropes of the mid-'90s, as protagonists pick their way through creepy locations in an effort to stay one step ahead of the terrifying killer "Scissorman". Inspired by Dario Argento's bug-filled 1985 flick, Phenomena, the Clock Tower games are praised for their mood, classic visuals, and unnerving atmosphere, but the series as a whole has always been hampered by slow, and in some cases archaic, gameplay mechanics. Regardless, they have found their own dedicated following — as all horror franchises tend to do.
Regardless, it's incredibly quirky to see an entire store devoted to its presence, and I'm sure fans will make sure they grab a hold of as many goodies as possible before the doors close for good at the end of the month. The Clock Tower store is situated in The Akihabara Container in Tokyo, Japan, and will operate from November 3 — November 29.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[According to a Bloomberg report, video game publisher Embracer has shut down Onoma, the studio formerly known as Square Enix Montreal, just months after its acquisition. Some staff will be transferred to Eidos Montreal, another studio owned by Embracer. This news comes just a few weeks after Onoma underwent a rebranding process where it adopted the new name.
Onoma was best known for its work on the Go series, turn-based spin-offs of popular Eidos Interactive titles designed for mobile. This includes Hitman Go, Lara Croft Go, and Deus Ex Go. Their most recent work was Tomb Raider Reloaded, which came to mobile devices earlier this year, and their future plans involved a title based on Avatar: The Last Airbender.
Earlier this year, Onoma was just one part of a much larger series of Embracer’s acquisitions, which included Crystal Dynamics and Eidos Montreal. In August, Embracer proceeded to acquire Limited Run Games, Tripwire Interactive, Tuxedo Labs, the IP rights to The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit, and several more studios.
The Bloomberg report also says that the closure is part of a cost-cutting initiative, and that Eidos Montreal will have projects scaled back and cut as well. Some of these resources will be redirected to assist in the development of a game in the Fable franchise, led by Playground Games.

Like every Call of Duty game, the majority of time spent playing involves either killing or being killed in horrendous ways, for one thing, and there’s a natural revulsion that comes from seeing so many gouts of blood shooting from bodies or the ragged slump of newly lifeless human corpses piled up in a doorway. And yet, the surface-level hideousness of its parade of death might not be so notably ugly if it wasn't for Modern Warfare II's cast of c…]]></summary>

It's time to break earth and set up a new home. The impossibly deep simulator Dwarf Fortress has set a Steam and Itch launch date of December 6, 2022.
This infamous engine for incredible internet stories is often perceived as pretty dense. But as part of the Steam launch, Bay 12 Games is also rolling out several major draws for newcomers to make dwarven life a bit easier to manage.
First off, the graphical tile set. Rather than ASCII characters moving around, Dwarf Fortress has pixel visuals you can pick up on a bit easier. Modders and community members have made these tools before, but Steam Dwarf Fortress arrives with a packed-in tile set.
Secondly, the new player experience has been updated to include tutorials. Via the Steam page, these tutorials will guide you through the process of building your first fortress and keeping all the dwarves inside happy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K7T5LXQPJI
Other than that, this is largely still Dwarf Fortress. It's still a massive, simulated world of possibilities and potential disaster. All it needs is a few intrepid dwarves.
Building the fortress
Dwarf Fortress has been the subject of many lengthy forum posts and storytimes. Much like EVE Online, it's a game that's endlessly fascinating to read about, but seems intimidating from the outside too.
With a Steam launch, updated graphics, and new player experience, this might be the time for me to give Dwarf Fortress an honest go of it. I've read enough stories. I'm ready to establish my own beautiful fortress, then watch it fall apart to infighting and chaos.
Developers Tarn and Zach Adams have been working on this game for ages, and seem set to keep doing so. And maybe this version is just the right jumping-on point as they dive further into what this simulation can possibly do.
Dwarf Fortress hits Steam and Itch on December 6, 2022.

When do My Nintendo points expire? Well it depends on the type of point it is! Let's go over both briefly as we head into the holiday season.
So My Nintendo Platinum Points expire after six months from collection. It's important to game the system as much as possible: meaning, there are ways to bank missions and not actually complete them until you need them. Our guide goes into more detail on this, and how you can use Fire Emblem Heroes to your advantage.
Gold Points, which are more like cash that can be used directly for eShop payments, expire in 12 months. There's a lot more leeway here with the expanded timeframe, but note that since a lot of folks make purchases in December, you might be coming up on a time period where a bunch will expire.
To check both of these timelines, you'll want to head to the "Point Summary" link at the bottom of the main My Nintendo login page, then click on point expiration.
How to earn more My Nintendo Points for the holidays
As a reminder, if you want physical rewards, you can find our full Platinum Point guide here, which has been updated with details on weekly missions: bookmark it for when you need quick points for a reward. A handful of points is incredibly easy to get, as that’s basically just 15 minutes with Super Mario Run, or a quick sign-on to the 3DS or Wii U 3Shop. Also remember that any shipments are bundled together, so you can pay a flat rate for multiple items instead of paying it each time. Just know that items go out of stock on My Nintendo frequently, and some are never restocked.

When it comes to unpredictable gaming announcements in 2022, nothing is going to beat the news that 1988's Z-movie Killer Klowns from Outer Space was being adapted into a modern-day video game — While it still something of a leftfield concept, Teravision Games has offered up a little more info on how accurately the developer is hoping to recapture the grotesque gory glory of the source material.
In a new blog post on the official website, Teravision details some side-by-side comparisons focusing on the locations, weapons, and, of course, the Killer Klowns themselves, showing the attention to detail being applied to the new asymmetrical adventure. While the characters and settings all look pretty superb, perhaps the best element on show here is the recreation of the film's aesthetic — its visual tone, its heightened use of vulgar color, and its unsettling emphasis on the juxtapositioned shadows.
It's looking pretty faithful, that's for sure. Check out the comparison shots in this new trailer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqS8joebwLo
As for the game outline itself, it is believed that KKfOS will be a chase-and-fight multiplayer title in the vein of Dead by Daylight, Predator: Hunting Grounds, and the upcoming Texas Chain Saw Massacre. A team of Crescent Cove civilians will take on the Cirque de Puree itself, attempting to prevent the Klown invasion while staying one step ahead of their clumsy gloved hands — lest you end up a ball of cotton candy or a mound of acid cream pie. It's a fun idea, and it will be great to see the title in action as it continues along the road to the big top.
Killer Klowns from Outer Space: The Game is currently in development for PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms. Interested goofballs can sign up for a future beta over on the official website. In the meantime, read more about the original movie and how it came to fruition right here.

There's a massive Overwatch 2 Mei bug afoot, and it's going to take some time to fix. How long? Well try November 15.
Here's everything Blizzard has shared on the matter, via their official forums:
"We are temporarily disabling Mei to address a bug with her Ice Wall ability that allowed heroes to reach unintended locations when used with their abilities. We are working to address these issues as quickly as possible and aim to bring Mei back in our next upcoming patch which is set for November 15. Thank you for your understanding and patience."

Mei is the third character that's had critical issues in Overwatch 2
Sadly for players who call any number of Overwatch heroes mains: Mei is the third hero since the launch of Overwatch 2 that's been taken out of the rotation and put on ice. Previously, Bastion and Torbjorn were removed from play, and now it's Mei's turn.
I'm mostly thinking about all of the brand new players who are dealing with the revised system, which requires you to unlock everyone manually like a fighting game. It would be a huge annoyance to finally pick up a character you've been working toward, only to see it disabled because of a bug.

The next Sonic game isn't too far off, and today Sega released a video setting the stage for the hedgehog's new adventure. A new Sonic Frontiers Prologue video puts the spotlight on what Knuckles has been up to.
This prologue, called Divergence, follows Knuckles as he tends to the Master Emerald on his island. We get a little lore refresher on his backstory, before seeing him make a new discovery on his island.
Some old tech whirs to life after he tinkers with it, and he winds up in a new location. As it turns out, it looks like Knuckles is in a Sonic Frontiers locale.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gjszHTDjzo
While Knuckles can certainly fend for himself, it looks like he's not strong enough to hold off this antagonist. Seems like Sonic, and by extension the player, will need to lend a helping hand.
A new frontier
This is one of several lead-in stories, meant to set the stage for Sonic Frontiers. It seems like we're dealing with a strange new foe, and that means a little more table-setting than "Eggman's at it again."
Still, we're somehow only a week out from the release of the new Sonic game. Revealed at The Game Awards in 2021, Frontiers has been the subject of both curiosity and scrutiny.
We've seen a fair bit of Frontiers already. There are its larger areas to explore and puzzles to solve. And there are some more familiar designs, akin to older Sonic entries.
Whether this new look for Sonic comes together, I just hope Knuckles turns out okay. I don't like the look of that Matrix bubble prison one bit.
Sonic Frontiers will launch for PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Switch, and PC on November 8.

It's an Xbox Game Pass Vampire Survivors kind of month, as the popular arcadey survival game expands its reach to consoles.
Microsoft has unveiled its early-to-mid Xbox Game Pass list, and things are looking pretty good for adventure and sports fans. As for the former, Return to Monkey Island is a standout, but there's also two seasons of Walking Dead: A New Frontier, and Michonne. As a reminder, New Frontier is the follow-up to the original Walking Dead first two seasons, continuing the story of Clementine, with newcomer Javi. Football Manager 2023 (both PC and console editions), which is a huge "may as well mess around with this a bit" kind of game, represents the sports world.
Of course, Vampire Survivors on console is a nice get. Despite the cheap price, I can see a lot of on the fence people trying before they buy here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sometimes, I just want to wander around an aesthetically pleasing landscape with nice music doing menial tasks - and that’s exactly what I got from Paradise Marsh, a lovely little wildlife game from LazyEti. I’ve been playing some pretty intense games recently, throttling my game controller as I run away from literal waves of rats in A Plague Tale: Requiem and shifting my detective brain into overdrive grappling with the excellent mysteries in The Case of the Golden Idol.
I desperately need a game to sink into, basically Lo-fi Hip Hop Beats to Relax/Study To: The Game, or the equivalent of a deep body massage but directly onto my brain. Paradise Marsh has been the exact tonic I’ve needed, a chill bug-collectathon where you wander around pleasant, pastel landscapes discovering lots of fun little curiosities. It’s wonderful.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The official Sonic the Hedgehog YouTube channel has uploaded an animated short titled “Sonic Frontiers Prologue: Divergence.” Starring Knuckles, the short reveals how he wound up on the island players explore in Sonic Frontiers. You can watch the six-minute animation in its entirety below.


In the trailer, Knuckles provides a voice-over explanation of his background up until now, including the fact that he was tasked with guarding the Master Emerald, a relic that hasn’t appeared in the Sonic series for quite some time. The trailer ends with Knuckles absolutely demolishing some robots, and while we’ve received no indication that he will be playable in Sonic Frontiers, that sequence makes me hope he will be.
Knuckles has been a core Sonic character for most of the franchise’s existence, so it’s not surprising that he’s making an appearance in the blue blur’s latest adventure. While this animated prologue gives us insight into how he wound up on the island, it’s still not entirely clear why, especially when it comes to the appearance of Sage (a new character introduced in Sonic Frontiers) at the end of the trailer. We’ll have to wait for the full game to find out.
The past month has been full of Sonic news. We got a December 14 release date for Sonic Prime, Sonic Frontiers got a trailer confirming Super Sonic would be playable in the game, and we learned that the Sonic series has sold over 1.5 billion copies worldwide. For more Sonic news, check out our cover story from earlier this year, and stay tuned for more Sonic Frontiers coverage when the game releases on November 8.]]></summary>

Despite having only launched just one month ago, Electronic Arts' FIFA 23 has already seen more engagement and playtime than some games can only dream of in their entire lifespan — Not only is the soccer sim the fastest-selling entry in franchise history, but the community has already played some 1.7 billion matches over the course of the past four weeks.
EA Sports noted the bewildering figure in a fun stat sheet pertaining to the new title, which launched on PC and consoles on September 29. According to the figures, over 200 nations have played for a total of 15 billion minutes, scoring 4.3 billion goals across the 1.7 billion matches. The top male goal scorer is Manchester United and England National player Marcus Rashford, while the top female scorer is Chelsea Women's Sam Kerr. Kerr also features on the cover of the Ultimate Edition and is the first woman soccer player to do so.
https://twitter.com/EASPORTSFIFA/status/1587127376974151688?s=20&t=r1NmmBMRRLW1qa-Z22GOrA
It should also be noted that AFC Richmond has racked up one million match wins to date. Good job, Ted.
FIFA 23 will be the final title in the decades-long franchise to feature joint collaboration between developer Electronic Arts and the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) brand. Following a complex (and somewhat bitter) licensing dispute, the two billion-dollar juggernauts decided to part ways in 2021. Electronic Arts' future soccer sims will retail under the new name of EA Sports FC, while the FIFA organization has stated its intention on developing its own rival soccer series, which it claims will "remain THE BEST". Hmm.
FIFA 23 is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

That's because its release is set for sometime this year, and given there are only two months left in 2022, it sounds like we won't have to wait too long to check it out. 
Outer Terror's inspirations are clear from the jump: pulpy horror comics and B-movie horror from the 1980s and 1990s with a dash of arcade fun thrown in for good measure. In the game, you'll choose from one of 10 survivors to control, each with their own unique weapons and skills, to face off against waves of enemies. You can play by yourself, but you can also team up with a friend via two-player co-op.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mount & Blade 2 Colon Bannerlord is disappointing. I'm not saying it's bad. In fact, it's overall pretty good, but too much of Bannerlord's design is exactly the same as it was in Warband, and the bulk of what's been added is extraneous strategy guff that doesn't meaningfully improve it at all.
In between leading your warband around its 2D map and stabbing dudes alongside your men in 3D battles, you can now make weapons by commandeering local workshops (I guess?) to break down and recombine spare swords. You can only do a few per day, so the pattern is to repeatedly click "make charcoal", then leave to rest your tired little arms and repeat. I could probably get a more ~optimal build~ by smithing a megasword, but the one I have already does what I need. You can’t equip your army, even though that was in the very ropey Freeman. The end result is another axe in a game where you'll discard hundreds of them. You can't do armour, a huge waste considering the variety available, and that you spend vastly more time seeing your outfits than looking at anyone's pommel.

An Overwatch 2 survey is rolling out for a number of users, and so far, it's a chance for active players to voice their ire for the new systems put in place in the "sequel."
Shared on the game's subreddit, scores of users are reporting that they've obtained an email from Blizzard, asking for feedback for the battle pass and Overwatch Store (read: the cyclical direct payment cosmetic store). As Eurogamer points out, some users are getting different "triggers" for the emails, that range from purchasing content, to not purchasing content. So it seems as if they're trying to get an array of feedback from pretty much everyone. As of publication, I personally have not gotten an email yet.
We're gonna need a bigger survey
As we've pointed out (particularly in the past week), Overwatch 2 is not running very smoothly post-launch. Some of the microtransactions feel particularly predatory, and one of the first major seasonal events isn't up to par.
While the game itself does still mostly feel like Overwatch, the main thing I noticed when first booting it up (and still deal with now) is how busy the game is. The season pass system isn't an upgrade, and I'm particularly worried about future seasons, especially ones that add characters into the mix.
One of the chief issues is that Blizzard, when erasing the original Overwatch and adding this free-to-play scheme, didn't really add much value: even for premium season pass owners. Maybe the PVE update will change that, but most of us are wondering when that will even happen (and some of you will be long gone, and won't wait that long to find out how it impacts Overwatch 2).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Still more questions remain
Kojima Productions has revealed another cast member who will be joining Elle Fanning in the studio's as-yet-unrevealed new title — Shioli Kutsuna, perhaps best known for their appearance as Yukio in Deadpool 2, will star in the new game in an as-yet-undisclosed role.
Shioli Kutsuna's presence was confirmed in another "headshot" teaser image, which sees the 29-year-old Japanese-Australian actor staring dead-on into the lens, engulfed in red light and emblazoned with the question "Where Am I?", similar imagery was used to tease the identity, and the eventual reveal of, Elle Fanning, who film fans will recognize from cinema jaunts such as Disney's Maleficent and Nicolas Winding Refn's excellent psychological horror The Neon Demon.
Producer Hideo Kojima is yet to spill the beans on the new title, which is believed to be a brand new IP, rather than a follow-up to his studio's 2019 release, Death Stranding. Kojima Productions is currently working on the new game in tandem with a sequel to Death Stranding itself. And, given Kojima's close relationship with industry pundit Geoff Keighley, it seems likely that we will be hearing more about the mysterious new project at the upcoming Game Awards — currently set to take place on December 8.

The revelation that EA and Marvel are forging some kind of Marvel Gaming Universe may delight or frustrate you, depending on how fed up you are with the MCU.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over three million consoles moved in last quarter
Sony Interactive Entertainment has released its financial results for fiscal year ending September 30, 2022, which shows that its most recent hardware platform, PlayStation 5 (PS5), has smashed past 25 million global shipments since its initial launch in November 2020.
According to the data, the shiny white behemoth shipped 3.3 million units in the most recent quarter, more or less matching the same period in 2021 and thus presenting steady sales for the (admittedly expensive) hardware. While there have been some struggles getting the ninth generation off to a strong start — impacted by production woes, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the cost of living crisis — it appears that sales of the PS5 system remain relatively comfortable for the time being.
In addition to the hardware figures, SIE also revealed that there are currently 45.4 million PlayStation Plus subscribers, though this figure is down some 1.8 million users from the same time frame one year ago. Much like Microsoft's the Xbox Game Pass service, it seems that PlayStation is continually struggling to grow its subscriber base, which had seen nothing but growth until the 2021 economy slump. Still, 45 million players is nothing to be sniffed at, and so it is unlikely that the publisher will be too concerned.
Further decline was seen in total game sales, with PS4 and PS5 combined software sales down a huge 13.9 million units over 2021, for a grand total of 62.5 million games sold. 63% of all full game sales were digital purchases — demonstrating that while the digital market continues its inevitable growth, physical media is not quite ready to be consigned to the garbage pile just yet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The AMD Ryzen 7 5800X is a good gaming CPU with better content creation performance than the more expensive 5800X3D - even though it's slower than the X3D in gaming. Still, at its price point it hits a punch, and the boffins at HUKD have spotted a good deal for the 5800X at CCL. There, you can find the 5800X for £235 when you use code AFF15 with some nifty extras: a 64GB Micro SD card and a code for Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves. 
The way it works is pretty simple - you need to get your total basket over £250 for the AFF15 code to work. So, pick anything on the store that's more than £5.51, like this Micro SD card, add it to your basket alongside the 5800X, then use the AFF15 code to bring the price down to the £235 we quoted. The game code will come with your order, no opt-in necessary, from what we understand.

        <updated>2022-10-31T20:00:37.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Spry Fox, the developer of games like Cozy Grove and Alphabears, is joining Netflix games to become the company’s sixth in-house game studio. The news was announced through a blog post on the Spry Fox website, which also answers some questions about the future of the studio.
Spry Fox says the partnership will not change any of their upcoming plans, meaning that Cozy Grove 2 and their unnamed non-violent MMO will still be developed as planned. Instead, Netflix will provide them with financial support, which Spry Fox says will allow them to “stop stressing” about how their games will generate profit. Despite all of Netflix’s current games existing through their mobile app, the blog post does not mention anything about platform exclusivity.
Spry Fox joins five other in-house game developers at Netflix: Next Games (Stranger Things: Puzzle Tales), Night School Studio (Oxenfree), Boss Fight Entertainment (Dungeon Boss), and two internal studios in Helsinki, Finland and southern California.
Netflix launched its games collection just over a year ago, in November of 2021. Currently, subscribers can play over 30 games on their mobile app, including Into the Breach, Spiritfarer, and Poinpy. On top of that, Netflix has over 50 more games in development. Have you had a chance to play any games on the Netflix app? Let us know in the comments.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Canny Overwatch 2 players have reported more success in obtaining skins by grinding for in-game gold in Blizzard’s long-running fantasy MMO World Of Warcraft and converting that into Battle.net balance than by completing weekly challenges in the hero shooter itself. The trick involves trading gold farmed in WOW for tokens that convert to Battle.net balance, which can then be spent on Overwatch 2 cosmetics. It’s a cunning ploy that speaks volumes about player frustration with the multiplayer shooter’s new free to play mechanics, a situation that might still change if Blizzard listen to results of a recent survey.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Electronic Arts' Motive Studios announced its Iron Man game in September, we learned it would be the first of a multi-game deal between the publisher and Marvel. That was a vaguely defined arrangement at the time, but we now know the partnership will produce a minimum of three titles.
EA announced the news in a press release, with the publisher describing it as a “long-term” deal that could extend beyond three games based on the wording. The release also specifies these titles will be action-adventure games for consoles and PC, each featuring original stories in the Marvel universe. 
It's worth clarifying that EA is not getting exclusive rights to Marvel like it had with Star Wars. There are multiple Marvel games in the works at various studios, including the recently announced Captain America/Black Panther game from Amy Hennig’s Skydance New Media. 
“We have been long-time fans of Marvel and their impressive leadership, so this is a remarkable moment for our developers as well as our players and fans,” said EA COO Laura Miele. “We look forward to welcoming Marvel into the EA family of creators and know this collaboration will produce exceptional experiences for our players. We can’t wait to see players' reactions when they suit up as Iron Man and do the extraordinary things this Super Hero is known for.”
We’re curious to learn what other Marvel projects are on the docket and which EA studios are behind them. Motive’s Iron Man, a single-player third-person action game, is currently in pre-production, so it’s a long way from release (the team is also making the Dead Space remake). What heroes would you like to see EA tackle, and which studio do you want to see bring them to life? Let us know in the comments.]]></summary>

The admission came as part of a response to players asking for more support characters in Overwatch 2, as there are currently only eight of them to pick from right now, versus the ten tanks and whopping 16 damage characters in its overall roster. It's not just the number of supports Blizzard have been thinking about either. Over the weekend, it also emerged the Overwatch 2 devs are sending out a survey to current players, with emphasis on the game’s store and the divisive battle pass introduced when the series went free to play. The developments follow on from hero balance changes being brought forward from season two to mid-November.

We seek out spooks even in the heat of summer, and know there's no better mid-winter warmer than a good ghost story. So what are we to do to make this occasion still feel special?
I know common wisdom considers Halloween to be "Goth Christmas", but in my experience goths bloody love Christmas as much as the next person. They are, however, far more likely to be agnostic on the subject of Valentine's Day. Yes, I have spent far too long thinking about this, but I'm determined to stand by my conclusions, thereby dubbing this holiday "Goth Valentine's". Which leads me neatly into the purpose of this feature: games that let you date the monster.

What you’ll find here, then, are SSD offers with genuine discounts only – and with both lightspeed-fast NVMe SSDs and affordable SATA SSDs on early sales, there's something for all kinds of PC builds.

Last year I cut my hand on a CPU cooler radiator. And did you see how dusty my PC was before I cleaned it? That’s basically body horror.
Apparently ignorant of their products’ ability to frighten and maim, PC gaming hardware makers sometimes try to manufacture an imposing aura by giving them big, bad names. You’ve probably seen these already: keyboards named after swords, laptops christened as mythical animals and the like. But some go full spooky, consulting the Halloween kids’ costume pantheon of creatures and creepers. Is an eerie moniker enough to strike fear, even before it has the chance to cause minor injuries or force you into a tedious warranty replacement process? Let’s find out.

Hm. Too late now! Plus, witches are totally Halloween fodder - and they're one of my key trends for games at the moment. Video games are lousy with both current and upcoming witches these days.
It makes sense. They've already got brilliant marketing. Few Halloween-y sights are more iconic than a pointy hat, a black cat, and a sihouetted figure flying in front of the moon on a broomstick. The witches I've collected here are definitely going to get you in the pumpkin spirit, even if they manage to run through most other genres except horror... Look, Halloween is mostly about sweets and dressing up these days anyway (and by the way, I am livid that I've not got any parties to go to this year, because my hair is exactly the right length to do a perfect Carmy Berzatto costume).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The original Butterfly Soup is named for its ending monologue. Its four main characters, Diya, Min-seo, Noelle, and Akarsha, use the liquefaction of a caterpillar inside a cocoon as a metaphor for the awkward teenage growing phase they’re all in. In the sequel, set a few months later, they find a butterfly with a crumpled wing. It’s a victim of a false spring, having emerged from its cocoon too early due to unseasonably warm weather. One of them worries that they are like the injured insect; forever marked by their early life. And it’s this that Butterfly Soup 2 digs into much more deeply than its predecessor.
If you’re not familiar with the original, Butterfly Soup is a visual novel about four Asian girls navigating high school in the late 2000s, playing baseball, and falling in love. On replaying it to get ready for this review, it made me cry at least twice and laugh out loud a bunch more. It’s pay what you want with no minimum price, and takes about 2-3 hours. I’m also going to spoil parts of it, so go play it already.

To celebrate spooky season, I gathered seven members of the RPS treehouse to tell me about one moment from a PC game that scared them the most. The results were exactly as I expected.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Remember Mewgenics? The wacky cat-breeding roguelike is the brainchild of Super Meat Boy co-creator and The Binding of Isaac mastermind Edmund McMillen and has been in and out of the works for a decade. After being announced, put on hold, and restarted, it appears to have a new release window. 
McMillen tweeted a gif of two of the game’s adorable cats engaging in what we'll call an intimate cat exercise. The tweet links to the game’s Steam page, which lists a 2024 release window.

October 28, 2022
What the heck is Mewgenics? The game tasks players with collecting and breeding hundreds of cats to train and send into battle. Or, as the Steam description puts it, Mewgenics is a “turn-based legacy roguelike draft sim about cats!” The game apparently boasts “100s of hours” of gameplay, multiple classes with over 50 unique abilities, over 200 enemies, and other features. 
Mewgenics was first announced in 2012, with McMillen at the time describing it as "By far the strangest project I've ever worked on.” McMillen has worked on it alongside Tyler Glaiel; the pair previously partnered for The End is Nigh, among other titles. The game was originally billed as a cross between Pokémon, The Sims, and Animal Crossing, and had first been planned to release in 2014. It was, of course, delayed, and its development was put on indefinite hold in 2016 when McMillen began work on The Legend of Bum-Bo, which launched in 2019. At the time, McMillen was unsure of Mewgenics’ future, but in 2018 he announced he was remaking the game to be released in “a few years.” 
The game is slated to launch for PC, though whether or not it’s still coming to iOS is unknown. Are you still interested in Mewgenics? Let us know in the comments! For more on Edmund McMillen, we spoke with him last December where he discussed his life and career, including Mewgenics, which you can read in this interview feature.]]></summary>

I've had an eye on All Quiet Roads for months, but between Tile Cities and Blink Planets it seemed a bit much to throw this recommendation at you as well. But a game exclusively about the thing I hate most holding my interest this well has to be respected. All Quiet Roads also balances relaxing, freeform play with stressful, occasionally overwhelming challenges, giving it a tonal variety that I wasn't really expecting from such a simple concept.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stress Level Zero's Boneworks was Half-life: Alyx before Half-Life: Alyx released. Released in December 2019, its combination of deeply tactile interactions with a campaign heavily inspired by Half-Life 2 represented a major step forward for VR experiences at the time. It had a fair few rough edges, and you needed a cast-iron stomach to play it, but for about four months it was the ambitious, all-encompassing VR experience that the medium had hitherto lacked.
Then Half-Life: Alyx came around, raising the (crow)bar so high that you'd need to be Mr Fantastic or some sort of bird with hands to reach it. Which is partly why Bonelab, the newly released sequel to Boneworks, hasn't quite gelled with me in the way its older sibling did. Technologically, its still very impressive, and noodling around with its massive interactive potential remains undeniably fun. But it often feels like a lot of good ideas with too little connective tissue between them. It's also even less compromising on your physiology than Boneworks was, seemingly determined to make existing in VR as uncomfortable as possible.

A colossal T-Rex-esque machine with powerful legs, twisted metal horns, and artillery cannons strapped to its back, it loomed larger than any other enemy I'd seen so far in the game. My first thought as I crouched behind a nearby rock and surveyed its chromium splendour was: "I am definitely not yet ready to fight this thing."
My second thought came quickly after the first, when my cover was blown by a nearby Watcher that immediately reared back and emitted a shrill noise that alerted the Thunderjaw to my presence. "Oh shite. Here we go."

The part of my brain responsible for going "holy mother of hell get me away from this scary thing" is dampened. I expect to be scared, and therefore I'm more resilient to said scariness. I might just not be very good at getting into the horror games mindset. My brain is too busy battening down all the hatches and readying the engines of war against the oncoming spookies and ghosties.
The times I've been most scared playing a game are when I don't expect to be scared. And what better way to lull myself into a false sense of security this Halloween than to play an otherwise not-so-scary game, with just one particularly horror-esque moment?

Still, by the end of my 90 minutes or so with the game, my feelings had evolved considerably, and I'm happy to say I'm now way more excited for it than I was. In fact, I think this could easily end up as the best Dark Pictures game yet.

All of Mei’s abilities revolve around ice, whether slowing down enemies with a snowy spray or incubating in a cocoon of ice. However, a compilation on Reddit showcases various problems with her Ice Wall ability, which seems to be in need of some serious TLC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With Pokémon Scarlet and Violet right around the corner, The Pokémon Company is releasing a new expansion in its Sword and Shield series. Silver Tempest stars Alolan Vulpix on the key art, but monsters like Lugia, Serperior, Ho-Oh, and Mawile share the spotlight. Meanwhile, players can expect cards starring Regieleki and Regidrago.
The Pokémon Company sent us several booster packs so we could open them and see what we pull. While it may just be dumb luck, I feel like this expansion gave me better pulls than any others in recent memory. As I cracked these open, I was met with several attractive full-art cards, as well as some gorgeous Trainer Gallery cards. I even managed to pull two of the three new Radiant Pokémon cards. 
This expansion adds over 190 cards to the ever-growing library of Pokémon cards. That number includes 6 Pokémon VSTAR cards, 15 Pokémon V cards, 1 Pokémon VMAX card, 30 special art Trainer Gallery cards, and more than 15 Trainer cards. You can see my favorite pulls from this expansion below.

Pokémon Trading Card Game: Sword and Shield – Silver Tempest launches on November 11. For all things Pokémon Trading Card Game, head to our special hub by clicking on the banner below!]]></summary>

"We've held price on our console, we've held price on games and our subscription. I don't think we'll be able to do that forever," Spencer admits. "I do think at some point we'll have to raise some prices on certain things." He was quick to point out, though, that these changes wouldn't come into effect this holiday season, as Microsoft wants to "maintain the prices that we have."

Since its launch in 2019, Apple Arcade has spoiled me so thoroughly with its beautifully crafted, ad-free experience that it’s hard to go back to anything else. To my surprise, this month saw the release of a game that fits both of these criteria: Marvel Snap. I downloaded it a few days ago and haven’t put it down since.
Marvel Snap is a free-to-play deck-builder with very short matches (usually only three to four minutes). As you play, you collect cards adorned with Marvel characters, each with a unique ability. Characters range from mainstream heroes like Hulk and Iron Man to ones I’ve never even heard of, like Ka-Zar or Blue Marvel. At only 12 cards, decks are relatively small, so every character counts.

At best, studios reimagine classic experiences in exciting new ways, sand away rough edges, and somehow retain the intangible x-factors that made fans fall in love with these titles in the first place. At the very least, remakes offer a great way to play antiquated or less accessible experiences on modern hardware. 
The remake boom has been in full swing in recent years to the point that it’s starting to get tough to keep track of all the projects in the works.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Paranormal Tales is an upcoming indie horror game with a unique perspective twist. Players experience the first-person adventure through the lens of a body camera to provide a more realistic, claustrophobic trek into its terrifying world. 
The game, created by two designers, draws inspiration from found footage films. The name shares the same initials as P.T., which I can’t imagine is coincidental. Players explore a series of video files as they control a person searching for their lost dog, Teddy. Expect to encounter some very creepy phenomena, and the realistic graphics (rendered in Unreal Engine 5) aim to sell the bodycam perspective effectively. Check out the trailer below if you're looking to raise a few hairs.


Paranormal Tales has no release window and has only been confirmed for PC so far. What do you think of the bodycam style in video games? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I pity anyone who has to review, or god help them, write a guide for Terra Invicta, because doing it even semi-comprehensively would take longer than I expect to live.
This is a hugely ambitious game, covering something I've never seen before, with a scope that makes Europa Universalis seem limited. It is a complicated, huge, and ponderous alien invasion simulator that constantly threatens to drop the other boot on you the entire time. Anything you do could be the butterfly whose little wingflaps eventually result in the obliteration of the planet. It is not a game to be powered through, but to be played and contemplated exclusively for a solid month.
That is its central weakness. But I think it had to be this way. Its commitment to an idea is demanding, but if you can tolerate some issues with clarity and presentation, the payoff for meeting it is utterly unique.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Callisto Protocol's Japanese version has been canceled due to the game's violent content and the rating it received in Japan, or lack thereof, as a result. 
This news comes from The Callisto Protocol's Japanese Twitter account, which reveals that the game could not achieve an age rating with CERO (which is Japan's equivalent to the United States' ESRB rating). As a result, it cannot be allowed to release as is in the country. Here's what the studio had to say, as translated by Eurogamer. 


"The Callisto Protocol has decided to stop the release of the Japanese version. As of now, the CERO rating cannot be passed. We have decided that we would no longer be able to provide you with the experience you need. We hope everyone in Japan will understand. If you have already preordered, we will refund you."

October 26, 2022
As you can see, The Callisto Protocol will not be releasing in Japan as it seems Striking Distance does not want to change or edit the content of its game to fall more in line with CERO ratings. Given how terrifying Japanese horror can be, it seems The Callisto Protocol is cooking up something scary.

The background is a big blinking eye, see, and it follows my mouse cursor, so I cannot resist making the eye look around and go silly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Saturnalia isn't a terribly long game, but it has spent much longer occupying my thoughts. Any time in the past couple of weeks that my friends and colleagues thought they were talking to me, they were in fact talking to an exquisite Italian neon-folk horror game wearing my skin and looking out of the eye-holes in my skull. On at least one occasion I lay in bed at 3am, sweaty and frozen in half-asleep fear, because I thought I'd heard a strange rattling noise...
In fact it was not stillness, but the panic-sprint into darkness that became my main and oft-unsuccessful tactic whenever I heard the creature of Gravoi. Gravoi itself is a small but inconveniently maze-like fictional Sardinian town, host to a yearly folk festival that, every so often, involves the unwary being carried off and killed by a... something. Unfortunately, four very unwary outsiders - rendered outsiders for a variety of reasons, whether they're locals or not - find themselves having to survive the night of this festival, armed with things like matches, firecrackers and a polaroid camera.

The experience comes from Jumpship, a studio founded by Dino Patti, former CEO of Limbo and Inside developer Playdead. That shared DNA is evident in Somerville’s somber, surreal atmosphere. The game centers on a rural family – a father, mother, and child – whose lives get turned upside down by a cataclysmic event involving extraterrestrial visitors. The journey unfolds as a side-scrolling adventure game where the family must survive this apocalypse as it rips through small towns and beyond. You can watch the most recent trailer below.


Somerville was first unveiled during E3 2021 and most recently popped up during last December's Game Awards. The game will be available on Xbox consoles (including Game Pass) and PC.]]></summary>

Over the course of a couple of weeks, we racked up a solid 60+ hours of game time. I'd wake up and see my friend clearing map markers. I'd pop out for a quick run (yes, I ran on my holiday like a chump) and return to see both of my friends clearing map markers. Did we enjoy it? Sometimes! But then, why couldn't we stop playing?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rieko Kodama, the pioneering Sega developer behind titles like Phantasy Star and Skies of Arcadia, has died at 58. 
Nick Thorpe, features editor for Retro Gaming Magazine, noticed that in the credits for Sega's Mega Drive Mini II, there's a message that reads, "In memory of Rieko Kodama." Twitter user Ares Arcadia quote-tweeted Thorpe's tweet to ask Sega producer Yosuke Okunari if this message means that Kodama had died to which Okunari replied and said, "As you understand it. We respected her," confirming her death. 
Sega has since confirmed Kodama's death, citing that she had passed in May, according to IGN. Further details around her death will not be shared out of respect for her family's privacy, Sega says. 
"We pray that the deceased will rest in peace, and we offer our gratitude for her enormous contributions to Sega," Sega of Japan says, as translated by IGN Japan. 
Kodama's journey through game development began in the 1980s when she started as a graphic designer for Master System and Sega Genesis games like Altered Beast and Sonic the Hedgehog. She was the main artist for Phantasy Star and continued to work on the series' visuals team until Phantasy Star IV: The End of the Millennium, which she directed.
Other credits include Mega Drive versions of Sorcerian, Alex Kidd in the Enchanted Castle, Sonic the Hedgehog 2, and more. After directing Phantasy Star IV, she directed Magic Knight Rayearth in 1995 before becoming a producer and development lead on Sega's Skies of Arcadia. She continued to work in games development in some capacity until at least 2018, where she was the lead producer on the Sega compilation title Sega Ages. 
In 2019, she was recognized with the Pioneer Award at GDC 2019. 
The staff at Game Informer extends their condolences to Kodama's family.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[BioWare have announced, via a blog post by general manager Gary McKay, that Dragon Age: Dreadwolf, the fourth game in their fantasy RPG series, has completed its Alpha milestone. If that means nothing to you, BioWare describe it as the moment “a game all comes together… we can experience the entire game, from the opening scenes of the first mission to the very end.” The Dragon Age sequel was officially announced in 2018, but it was initially conceived as a game about wizard heists before restarting development. So, Dreadwolf's progress should be encouraging to fans of the series.

Our froggy pal has saved a haunted island from the clutches of ghosts, thwarted wizardous party-poopers in Warlock Woods, and now their investigatory prowess has taken him to the wild west. Frog Detective 3: Corruption At Cowboy County may be the last in Worm Club's trio of Frog Detective games, but it's also a certified banger, successfully joining the first and second games in putting a stupid smile on my face for the entire time I played.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[38-inch gaming ultrawides are few and far between, and it's particularly rare to find good deals on them - so that's why I was excited to see this Dell Alienware AW3821DW on sale with a code from HUKD. When you use code HUKDAW3821DW, this monitor drops from £1299 to £899, an incredible value for a monitor of this spec. 
Let's quickly run through those specs. This 38-in monitor has a resolution of 3840x1600, essentially a shorter version of 4K, with a 144Hz refresh rate. The monitor is Nvidia G-Sync Ultimate certified, meaning it has a physical G-Sync module to prevent judder and tearing, and it also gets bright enough to earn the lofty DisplayHDR 600 rating. All in all, it's a ton of monitor for a fairly reasonable price.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello again. Now that Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 (the second one) is out in full, not just its campaign, I’ve revisited my best settings guide to see whether it can provide a preset-beating balance of looks and performance in the multiplayer component as well. And it does! If anything the various online modes tend to run more smoothly and consistently than the singleplayer story, but whichever you prefer playing, you can make just a few key changes to visibly improve your frames per second. And a COD with more frames just feels better.
Despite this universal truth, MW2 can be a toughie on older PC hardware: even graphics cards listed among the recommended system requestions need quality cuts to get a stable 60fps at 1080p. In this guide I’ll be showing you how various GPUs perform and where, precisely, the make those cuts if needed.

They’re relentless, for one thing, happily chomping their way through anyone who gets in their path. The undead are faceless as well, so you don’t feel too bad about escorting them back to their graves. Yet they can be poignant, dramatic reminders of friends and family that meant a lot to characters too, depending on who the shambling corpse used to be. If I was going to hire any enemy for a game, I’d hire a zombie. Then they’d eat my brain. That’s why I hired them! So to celebrate our very iconic, vitality-challenged friends, I've put together a list of my favourite zombie games.

It wasn't a neck-and-neck, ebb-and-flow struggle between two equal powers. Instead I played RTS games as though they were city-builders, with the added bonus of absolutely steamrolling through the AI when I'd had enough fun.
This was true of basically every RTS I played back then. In Starcraft I'd amass an army of Protoss Carriers and launch them across the map. In Supreme Commander, I'd tech all the way up to the Experimental Weapons, and then send the colossal CZAR Mothership to Independence-Day the entire enemy base. But my favourite variation of this was in Impossible Creatures: a wonderful early noughties strategy game where you create your own units by stitching together parts from different animals.

Nonetheless, it seems the two are leaving Rocksteady amicably at the end of the year with confidence in the team they're leaving behind to carry Suicide Squad across the finish line.

Bethesda Game Studios announced back in 2020 that it was teaming up with Amazon Studios and Kilter Films to develop a Fallout TV series. Early details revealed that Westworld creators and producers Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy signed onto the project and are partnering with Fallout 4 director and long-time Bethesda producer Todd Howard to bring the show to life.
Since then, not much else has been released except a 2021 report that details the show as a "gonzo, crazy, funny adventure" and some leaked set photos that reveal some pretty accurate set designs and costumes. However, today, in celebration of Fallout's …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A trailer from the Pokémon Company International has revealed the Greavard, the Ghost Dog Pokémon, just in time for Halloween. You can watch the official reveal below.


On Twitter, the official Pokémon account describes this haunted hound with the following Pokédex-like entry:
That second sentence ties into the first part of this reveal – an animated video posted on the Pokémon YouTube Channel about a trainer searching the Paldea region for ghost-type Pokémon. They eventually stumble upon a Greavard, but mysteriously collapse after playing fetch.
Greavard’s reveal continues a trend in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet’s marketing campaign where they post animated teasers and reveals of each new monster coming to the games. It started with Grafaiai and has continued all the way up to Bellibolt, a Pokémon revealed less than two weeks ago.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bethesda revealed Arkane Studios' open-world, co-op FPS Redfall back in 2021, and since then, the companies have been slowly pulling back the curtain on what to expect in this vampire-infested experience. We've received new trailers, details about how campaign progress is tied to the host in co-op, and we've even previewed the game (read here). 
Now, Bethesda and Arkane have released a new "Into The Night" Redfall trailer inviting players to experience a night out on the town to discover all the (bloody) fun that awaits. Spoilers: there's a lot of blood, a lot of vampires, and at least one giant heart that we probably need to destroy. Check out the new Redfall trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, Redfall continues to look like good fun. Today's trailer makes me wish this game was coming out this month – it'd be such a great Halloween game – but it's not due out until sometime during the first half of 2023. It will hit Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC, as well as Xbox and PC Game Pass when it's released. For more information, be sure to check out Game Informer's Redfall hub.

By the end of Bayonetta 3's third chapter, it's operating on a scale that dwarfs most video games. Buildings twist and crumble like flimsy plastic, giant craters pock-mark the earth, and mountain-sized creatures level entire cities; the bombastic culmination of an opening three hours that feel like they're running a mile a minute; a never-ending barrage of stimuli.
It's loud, obnoxious, and frankly a bit exhausting. And I was hootin' and hollerin' the entire time. 
The Bayonetta series has always been at its best when you're staring slack-jawed at your TV, repeated…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of Overwatch's most popular annual events was Halloween Terror, which brought not only Halloween-inspired skins and rewards to the game's loot box system but a unique PvE experience. 
Halloween Terror has returned, this time to Overwatch 2 and much like the years of experiences before it, this year's event comes with skins, rewards, and a semi-sequel to the first game's Halloween PvE experience, Junkenstein's Revenge. The new PvE mode for Overwatch 2 is now called Junkenstein's Revenge: Wrath of the Bride and you can jump in starting today, October 25. 
Zomnics, monsters, witches, oh my! 😱#Overwatch2 Halloween Terror festivities begin Oct 25! pic.twitter.com/PvDSWmn0k0
October 24, 2022
"Return to Adlersbrunn alongside four fresh faces to experience an all-new story as the Bride of Junkenstein seeks vengeance upon those responsible for the death of her creator," a blog post about the limited-time co-op mission reads. "Complete challenges to unlock special rewards like the Nightfall Over Adlersbrunn Name Card, the Jack-o'-Lantern Weapon Charm, Battle Pass XP, and other spine-tingling rewards. Dr. Junkenstein will also be making a grand reappearance in the original Junkenstein's Revenge co-op Brawl, returning for a limited time to Halloween Terror 2022." 
Halloween Terror will run until 11 a.m. PT/2 p.m. ET, November 1. If you watch two hours of streams on the Overwatch 2 category on Twitch, you'll receive the Werewolf Winston Spray and if you watch four, you'll receive the Werewolf Winston Legendary Skin (pictured above). 
Alongside this event, Blizzard is also running a Double Match XP weekend for Overwatch 2 starting October 28 and lasting until October 31. All players who login to Overwatch 2 sometime during the Halloween Terror event through the end of Season One will receive the Cursed Captain Reaper Legendary Skin and Health Pack Weapon Charm as well.

Spawned in 2007 by Capcom veterans, including Resident Evil creator Shinji Mikami and Devil May Cry and Okami mastermind Hideki Kamiya, the studio became a haven for these minds to create new franchises under the freedom of independence. Early success like MadWorld turned heads, but Platinum’s third title, Bayonetta, cemented it as one of the game industry’s premier action studios.
Launching in Japan in 2009 and hitting U.S. shores in 2010, Bayonetta revamped and, in some ways, improved the stylish action of its spiritual predecessor, Devil May Cry. The bewitching adventure reinvented and reinvigorated the stylish action genre; Platinum created its magnum opus in only two years. Unfortunately, sales didn’t match the reception, and Sega, the game’s original publisher, passed on a sequel. Despite fans’ cries, Bayonetta seemingly ended the series before it could take off.
Nintendo stepped up to answer those pleas by agreeing to publish a follow-up. Bayonetta 2 arrived in 2014 as a Wii U exclusive. The sequel proved Bayonetta wasn’t a one-hit wonder, becoming one of the year’s best games with some fans believing it surpassed its predecessor. The success also proved the family-friendly Nintendo had no problem letting the franchise remain true to its Mature-rated self.

They also follow a statement released by Platinum Games that essentially asks the community to support Hale and her statement.

Pairing asymmetrical multiplayer experts IllFonic with the Ghostbusters license is a match made in the spirit realm. Previous outings Friday the 13th and Predator: Hunting Grounds pit Jason and Predator against camp counselors and mercenaries with flashes of greatness, but technical issues and uneven design choices held them back. With Ghostbusters: Spirits Unleashed, the team has applied everything it’s learned about compelling asymmetrical multiplayer to a property that perfectly lines up with the game…]]></summary>

Join us today on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central to enjoy two hours of what will be a full playthrough of the cult favorite action game streaming weekly each Friday. You can also catch up on previous episodes by visiting our new Game Informer Shows YouTube channel or watching the embedded video below. 
Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance serves as a sequel/spin-off to Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots that puts cyborg ninja Raiden at the helm. Instead of sneaking around in boxes, players eviscerate foes in fast-paced, stylish action courtesy of developer Platinum Games. Since its launch in 2013, Revengence’s action and absurdity have garnered it a passionate internet fandom, but I have a little secret: I didn’t think the game was all that special when I played it at launch. However, years of being inundated with internet memes and being told my opinion is incorrect has inspired me to give Revengece another look. Will I acquire a new appreciation for the game nine years later? How many watermelons will I slice? You’ll have to tune in to find out. 


Join me, Marcus Stewart, as I revisit Raiden’s beloved solo adventure. If you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes. You’ll also be granted entry to the official Game Informer Discord channel, where our welcoming community members, moderators, and staff gather to talk games, entertainment, food, and organize hangouts!]]></summary>

Going into my hands-on time with Pokémon Scarlet, I was expecting some changes based on the ninth generation’s embrace of open-world gameplay and a “do what you want when you want” mentality with its three primary story paths. Pokémon has yet to take the massive generational shift I’ve dreamed of for years and has instead opted for half-steps with each new entry. Scarlet isn’t the transformation I hoped for, but it’s significantly more than a simple half-step, representing arguably the most considerable shift in mainline Pokémon history.

Capcom revealed that it was remaking the beloved classic earlier this year, giving it a March 24, 2023 release date. Now, the company has released a second trailer for Resident Evil 4 and simply put, this game looks stunning. It wasn't a surprise when Capcom revealed it was remaking Resident Evil 4 – it was next in line after all – but given how well-regarded the original is, plenty of people were skeptical this remake would live up to its legacy. Capcom is deadset on proving skeptics wrong if yesterday's trailer is any indication. 
Check out the new Resident Evil 4 remake trailer for yourself below:
