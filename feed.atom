        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Star Wars Outlaws PC system requirements are officially out, and we know you'll need at least 16GB of RAM to run this massive game. The storage required for Star Wars Outlaws, however, might be less than you'd expect; Ubisoft definitely used some Jedi mind tricks.

Star Wars Outlaws PC system requirements for minimum specs


To play this game from a galaxy far, far away at 1080p on low settings, you'll need at least 65GB of SSD storage space and some decent specs. Here is everything you'll require, according to the Epic Games Store:



OS: Windows 10 with DirectX12


Processor: AMD Ryzen 5 3600 or Intel Core i7-8700k


Memory: 16GB (dual-channel mode)


Storage: 65GB SSD


Graphics: AMD Radeon RX 5600 XT (6GB), NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660 (6GB) or Intel Arc A750 (8GB) with REBAR ON



This will let you play the game at 30 frames per second on the low preset with the upscaler set to quality. You'll also require a Ubisoft account for Star Wars Outlaws to run on PC. Unfortunately, the game isn't on Steam as of the time of writing.


Recommended specs for Star Wars Outlaws


If you're hoping to play Star Wars Outlaws as how the developers intended, you'll need the following specs:



OS: Windows 10 with DirectX12


Processor: AMD Ryzen 5 5600x or Intel Core i5-10400


Memory: 16GB (dual-channel mode)


Storage: 65GB SSD


Graphics: AMD RX 6700XT (12GB), NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060Ti (8GB)



These specs will let you play Star Wars Outlaws at 1080p with 60 frames per second. You'll have the high preset with the upscaler set to quality. 


As games finally begin to be developed for current-gen consoles and PC rather than relying on the older generation, we're seeing higher graphics quality in modern gaming. Black Myth: Wukong, another game releasing in August, requires 16GB of RAM as well rather than the typical 8GB.

Other measures are designed to improve voice actor working conditions, and stop companies using their voices and likeness as fuel for generative AI tools without their consent. It's both a praiseworthy endeavour and an interesting breakdown of the voice-actor's trade.

I played The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria at launch and am excited to dive into the game anew on Xbox Series X/S, especially with crossplay functionality. It's The Golden Update that should draw fans new and old to the game, though, because it packs in a treasure trove of new content for you to dig your pickaxes into, including a slew of bug fixes and improvements that will make the game a lot more stable.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There’s a lot of crafting resources in Fields of Mistria, and some of them are easier to find than others. Unlike Wood, Stone, or even Hay, Cattail Fluff doesn’t come to you in the course of your everyday tasks, so where do you get it?


Where to find Cattail Fluff in Fields of Mistria


If you’re looking for Cattail Fluff, you’ll need to head to the Eastern Road. This area is east of Mistria on the map, and also the location of the bridge where you begin your Mistrian adventure and later repair. 


Image by Destructoid


Cattail Fluffs can be found in the ponds and lakes towards the southern half of the Eastern Road map. Just like Water Chestnuts, they grow on the very edge of the water. They appear as Reeds, and when interacted with will produce the same amount of Cattail Fluff as there are heads on the Reeds.

Cattail Fluff respawns daily, so make sure to visit the area regularly to build up a hoard for all your crafting purposes. Alternatively, if you have a surplus of Tesserae, you can always buy Cattail Fluff from Balor's Wagon for 25 Tesserae each.


How to use Cattail Fluff in Fields of Mistria

When you’ve got a bunch of Cattail Fluff stocked up, you can head to your nearest Crafting Bench. There’s one in town outside the Bell Tower, and another at the Carpenters Shop, or you can purchase one to have on your farm from the latter as well. 


Cattail Fluff is used to make any furniture with padding. This includes beds, chairs, and rugs. You’ll need a varying amount, depending on which item you’re wanting to craft, with the minimum amount being three in order to make a Worn Bed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Luna is the latest character introduced with the July 31 update in The First Descendant. Here are all the materials you'll need to add this support character to your Descendant list.


Nexon Games released The First Descendant 1.0.5 update on July 31 where Luna is one of the characters introduced alongside Ultimate Valby. She is a Non-attribution character who can grant various effects to her allies using her music.


How to get Luna in The First Descendant


You can get Luna in two ways: by spending 900 Caliber or crafting her.


The first method is the fastest way to get her in the game but it will cost you money. Since the in-game store doesn't give you the option to purchase 900 Caliber, you'll need to purchase 1060 Caliber which will ultimately cost you $19.99.


The second way to get her is by crafting. Like all other Descendants, this method is time-consuming and requires you to collect Research Materials and Gold.

How to craft Luna in The First Descendant


Speak to Magister Anais in Albion to craft Luna and for that, you've to collect all the necessary materials first. We've listed all of these items below:


Luna Enhanced Cells



Silicon 430x


Carbon Crystal 554x


Pure Energy Residue 40x


Luna Enhanced Cells Blueprint 1x


200,000 Gold



Luna Stabilizer



Flectorite 292x


Hellion 303x


Highly-concentrated Energy Residue 34x


Luna Stabilizer Blueprint 1x

Luna Spiral Catalyst



Superfluid 571x

Specialized Biometal 46x


Luna Spiral Catalyst Blueprint 1x

After collecting everything, click on the Research Request button while talking to Anais. This will initiate Luna's research process. You'll need an additional 400,000 Gold and wait for 16 hours for the entire research process to complete.


Luna is the 15th Descendant to be added to the roster with the Synthesizer Gun being her trademark weapon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just like in real life, speed is the best friend of wide receiver (WR) in College Football 25. The faster they are on the ground, the harder it's going to be for any defender to keep pace as they run their routes or burn rubber towards the end zone.


Sure, they will need to be good at jumping and catching the ball, but that's of little use if they can't use their ability to run. Let's take a look at the ten fastest WRs on the default roster.


10 WRs in College Football 25 with the highest speed


Determining the fastest WRs is easy, thanks to the SPD rating. The SPD rating is a direct reflection of how fast an athlete will be on the field. I have also added the agility stat on the side (which hasn't been used as judgment), as it's another critical area for the wide receiver position.


Name
SPD
OVR
AGI


Nyck Harbor
99
82
88


Arian Smith
98
77
93


Monaray Baldwin
98
83
96


Jordan Anthony
98
75
96


Barion Brown
98
85
93


Jelani Watkins
98
72
93


CJ Smith
98
76
86


Isaiah Bond
98
88
94


Anthony Evans III
98
73
94


Che Nwabuko
98
71
96






The WR position is at a tricky spot in College Football 25 when it comes to speed. On the one hand, several athletes are fast, with Nyck Harbor being the fastest of the lot. In fact, he's the only WR with a SPD rating of 99. On the other hand, most of the names on this list don't have a notable OVR rating.


The most all-rounded athlete on this list is Texas' Isaiah Bond. With a SPD rating of 98 and an OVR of 88, he's a cut above the remaining names on the list. Do note that there are more athletes with 98 SPD in the game, but they haven't been placed here due to having lower OVR ratings.

The new quest is the stepping stone between everything players know and what is yet to come. 


The Lotus Eaters is a prologue quest that sets up the narrative for what players will see in Warframe: 1999. The quest was revealed at TennoCon 2024 and will see players meet up with a character they've not interacted with for quite some time: The Lotus. In this short quest, you're heading off to investigate a strange yet familiar sound in Sanctum Anatomica on Deimos. Somehow, this all leads back to Albrecht Entrati, but it's up to you to uncover the links.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We've still a bit to go until the Halloween season is upon us. But now seems like a good opportunity for horror fans to get a wee bit excited. Along with Bloober Team finally getting ready to launch the remake of Silent Hill 2, Saber Interactive has also given us the launch date for A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead.


In the most recent trailer, we're being told that the horror adaptation will be coming to us on October 17. That's just a couple of weeks before the Spooky Season, which is always a bit of a cliché, but it does make sense.




The trailer itself is chock-full of the usual teases and snippets of gameplay. I certainly don't want to get ahead of myself given the general reputation of video game movie tie-ins, but The Road Ahead does look like it has a lot of potential.


To quietly go


Taking A Quiet Place's concept of remaining silent so as not to be detected by monsters should – on paper at least – translate well to the gaming sphere. Anyone who's ever played a survival horror game where the object is to avoid combat and enemy encounters knows all too well how tense things can get.


As for The Road Ahead itself, it's not a straight-up adaptation of the films. It boasts its own storyline inspired by its cinematic counterpart, although a previous trailer shows there may be some story elements that have been lifted from the first movie.


In any case, I don't want to immediately get my hopes up, but I can only contain any vague sense of excitement for so long. I am but human, after all.

Before you can get animals on your farm, you need to be able to make animal feed for them to eat. To do this, you’ll first need to repair the run down Mill in Mistria’s town center. 


Just like repairing the Bridge, you’ll need to wait for a letter from Adeline in the mail before you can begin the quest to repair the Mill.

The game's new Escalation of Freedom update has only just come out, and the players have already figured out that it's loaded with a few non-insignificant nerfs to flame-based weapons, such as the incendiary Breaker shotgun and the flamethrower, among others.


More specifically, the community feels that the Escalation of Freedom update has essentially reneged the developer Arrowhead Games' prior promise to more mindfully balance weapons. The flamethrower, for one, can no longer effectively take down armored enemies (like the infamously annoying Charger), and the incendiary Breaker has lost two full magazines' worth of spare ammo in an attempt to make it a less popular choice on Terminid missions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The upcoming action RPG from Game Science, Black Myth: Wukong, features realistic graphics and intense gameplay. So, you must be intrigued to know the minimum and recommended PC requirements for the title, and here's everything you need to know.


Black Myth: Wukong is a Sekiro-like game that is based on Chinese Mythology, and is also one of the most anticipated games of August 2024, alongside Star Wars Outlaws.


Here are the PC system requirements.


Black Myth: Wukong minimum system requirements


These are the minimum PC requirements to play Black Myth: Wukong at 1080p in at least 30 frames per second:



OS: Windows 10 64-bit


CPU: Intel Core i5-8400 / AMD Ryzen 5 1600


Memory: 16 GB RAM


GPU/Graphics Card: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 6GB / AMD Radeon RX 580 8GB


DirectX: Version 11


Storage: 130 GB available space



Thankfully, the minimum specs aren't too demanding, unlike some other games that were released this year. This means if your rig is equipped with dated hardware, you'd still be able to enjoy the Sekiro-like at playable framerates.


If your system meets these requirements, an HDD would be enough to run the game, however, the devs always recommend an SSD for optimal loading speeds.

Black Myth: Wukong recommended specs


If you want to notch up a level and play the game with better graphics and framerates, Game Science recommends these specifications:



OS: Windows 10 64-bit


CPU: Intel Core i7-9700 / AMD Ryzen 5 5500


Memory: 16 GB RAM


GPU/Graphics Card: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 / AMD Radeon RX 5700 XT / INTEL Arc A750


DirectX: Version 12


Storage: 130 GB available space



An SSD is the recommended storage option here.

But what if we told you there was a way to make it even better...?
Fans have managed to find a way to make the Master Sword "unbreakable" via an extremely long and convoluted process of glitches, and YouTuber El Duende 05 has documented the steps in an hour-long video. Yes, an hour (thanks, ReadWrite!).

I was already loving the Ryzen 7000 series performance on Linux with its AVX-512 implementation and performing so well across hundreds of different Linux workloads but now with the AMD Ryzen 9000 series, AMD is hitting it out of the ball park.

If you've played an Ys game before, you know that our red-haired hero Adol Christin is pretty partial to a boat. He's also partial to a shipwreck or three. Adol's very first adventure in Ys I starts off with his boat being destroyed by a storm; Ark of Napishtim opens with Adol washed up on the beach; and in Lacrimosa of Dana, his ship is attacked by a sea serpent.
Adol is hit by sea disasters so frequently that it's joked about both in-game and by the community; there's no way we're getting on a boat with Adol, even if it's just a raft. But in Ys X: Nordics, that's exactly what you have to do — not just get on the boat with him, but enhance it, control it, and crew it. How did Nihon Falcom manage to go 35 years without giving us the helm of a ship?

MGS2 offers up a smorgasbord of options to avoid or take out your enemies, including tranquilising them in the gonads, distracting them with noise, or straight up somersaulting into them.

This is not the murmuring of some poor sod on a nineteen-hour Dota 2 binge who’s started thinking that the crumbs in his keyboard resemble a viable snack, but a bold new reality, one I recently found myself staring down during a trip to Asda. The supermarket chain – third biggest in the UK by turnover and purveyors of ill-fitting clothes and surprisingly good doughnuts alike – has added light-up gaming mice, keyboards, and headsets to its mountain of own-brand wares.
Asda being what it is (Americans, if you’re unfamiliar, think Walmart with less gun violence), it’s all dirt cheap as well. £17 for a full-size keyboard. £16 for an FPS mouse. Overwhelmed with curiosity, I ended up taking home a complete starter set (keeb, different mouse, headset, and mousemat) for £45, or about a third of the price of the Logitech G515 Lightspeed TKL that I’d shortly kick off my desk. Could this be a new frontier in affordable PC hardware, bringing tech to the masses in a way no specialist retailer ever could, or should supermarkets stick to cereal and meal deals? Surely the Asda Tech (real name) 4-in-1 Gaming Kit would have the answers.

Online games require a good Internet connection as it determines various aspects such as the ping you receive, which is particularly important in Apex Legends.


While ping is perhaps the most common factor to take care of, there are also other connectivity issues players may experience in Apex Legends. The game offers indicators while in-game which informs players if they are having a bad connection and there are different Apex Legends connection symbols which specify exactly what kind of issue players are experiencing.

As of the game’s latest hotfix blog, we’ve now got a better idea when we’ll start seeing some of these “smaller bits and pieces.” Bits and pieces? In this economy? Yes, and this month in fact. “Late August” to be precise by quoting a vague statement precisely.

The company has teamed up with Japanese companies previously, so could we see it work on something related to Nintendo's first-party releases in the future?

If you want even more of a challenge with even more rewards, here’s what you need to do to unlock the Helldivers 2 difficulty.


How to get Super Helldive in Helldivers 2


To unlock Super Helldive in Helldivers 2, you have to complete a level 9– Helldive operation. This means that you simply have to complete an entire mission set, consisting of three levels, to unlock the difficulty.


This could be a lot tougher now with the recent nerfs to some of the best weapons in the game, but also, the inclusion of new enemy variants to both the Terminids and Automatons. Even with the new patch, you’re still better off completing a Terminid operation ove…]]></summary>

It's currently sitting in the top sellers side of Steam, and early adopters seem to be vibing with its rural-life activities and '80s anime aesthetic. One note, though: it seems like at least a few would really, really like to date Olric.


Some context: I've yet to actually play Fields of Mistria myself. As one of the editors here, I was doing some digging through Google Trends, looking at what the several thousands of people playing the game were looking for online. Lo and behold, in the "breakout" category, Olric.

The Major Order in question tasked the Helldivers 2 community with killing a total of 1.5 billion enemies. If they succeeded, Super Earth wouldn't give them the new mines because the old ones obviously worked. Failing the Major Order meant unlocking the Anti-Tank Mines Stratagem, and that's exactly what happened. We managed to get to about 50% of the overall target before the Major Order ended, thinking the only thing we'd lose was the meme of always going against this Stratagem. But develo…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Water Chestnuts, a key resource in the early stages of Fields of Mistria, offer significant benefits. They are not only part of Requests but also provide valuable stamina boosts. This guide will demonstrate how to obtain Water Chestnuts in Fields of Mistria and detail their versatile uses.


Where to find Water Chestnuts in Fields of Mistria


You can get Water Chestnuts in Fields of Mistria by the edge of the water at the Narrows. The Narrows are to the left of the main Mistria location, on the same pathway as the Museum and Mines. The Water Chestnuts primarily spawn in the river at the bottom.

To harvest Water Chestnuts, look for small green sprouts in the water and approach them closely. Alternatively, you can jump into the river and swim around to collect them more efficiently.


Screenshot by Destructoid


You'll find a plentiful supply of Water Chestnuts in the river, making it easy to complete missions like Request for Water Chestnuts. Additionally, this ingredient can be combined with Wild Berries to make the Trail Mix recipe, a meal that's perfect for newcomers. It replenishes health and stamina by 12, which will undoubtedly be helpful when you're stuck in the mines. Fortunately, the Wild Berries are much easier to find, as they can be picked from bushes throughout the map.


To collect more Water Chestnuts in Fields of Mistria, you'll need to wait for them to respawn near the bridge. The chestnuts should be replenished daily, so keep checking on them in the Narrows.

How to find Impalers in Helldivers 2


To find an Impaler in Helldivers 2, you’re more likely to encounter them at level 7– Suicide Mission– and higher. While they may be encountered at lower levels, they are a lot less frequent to come by.  


They look like a larger variant of the standard Charger, but blue and spiky. Impalers also have darker orange underbellies, so you have to be careful when encountering them in hordes.


These tend to come out on main objectives or when the mission timer gets closer to 0. Much like the rest of the Terminids yo…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EA and Respawn have set a September 17, 2024 launch date for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions of Star Wars Jedi: Survivor. If you've been holding out for the day Cal Kestis once again graces the previous generation of consoles, your wait is almost over.


Digital pre-orders are live for the PS4 and Xbox One versions, which clock in a little cheaper than their current-gen counterparts. This one has been optimized specifically for the capabilities of the respective platforms, and it's priced at $49.99. Those who pre-order will get a Combustion Blaster and an Obi-Wan-inspired robe. 




Star Wars Jedi: Survivor first launched on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC via Steam, Epic Games Store, and EA App on April 28, 2023. It essentially took what 2019's Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order offered and gave us way more of the good stuff. 


Speaking of good stuff, Respawn is hoping to inject more of it into the PC port. When it initially launched, it was buggy and messed up enough to warrant an apology. Improvements have been made since, and the latest press release says more enhancements are on the way "in the coming weeks."


The upcoming patch promises updates to technical performance, controls, and other features. Players can also look forward to "a variety of quality-of-life improvements" when the fixes go live. Here's hoping everything goes smoothly both for the PC version and the previous-gen consoles, which have a pretty beefy game on their hands with this one.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you've begun the Shards Request mission, you'll likely be puzzled by the resource's mysterious locations. They aren't exactly out in the open like other items, given that they must be unearthed with specific tools. So, if you want to complete the quest and earn crafting materials, here's how to get Shards in Fields of Mistria.


Where to find Shards and Dig Sites in Fields of Mistria


Use your shovel on a Dig Site to get Shards in the Fields of Mistria. If you haven't obtained this tool yet, the General Store sells a Worn Shovel for 500 Tesserae. I've had the most luck finding the Shards at the Western Ruins site, located to the left of the Narrows.

Go to the south side of the Western Ruins to find an archeology area. You should see a dig spot where you'll need to use your shovel. However, keep in mind that Shards don't always drop, and you may end up with another item instead.

One Dig Site will spawn at the Western Ruins daily, so check back on this destination for more Shards. If you want to increase the digging spots there, speak to Caldarus (the dragon statue) and unlock the Western Ruins Scholar perk. It will spawn an additional spot to farm more resources. 


Shards may appear in other areas, like the mines, whenever there's a Dig Site to uncover. I haven't had much luck outside of the Western Ruins, but it could still be possible. The material can also be used for crafting, along with the Shards Request. I suggest saving some for yourself for a future build in case it's needed again.

The major focus of the 1.4 patch is to bring in additional resources and production. The marquee feature here is fishing, which is done at ponds. These are resource nodes, much like many of the others that already exist within the game world. These are exploited using fishing huts.


There are also new buildings, resources, needs, and orders. With the addition of new resources and blueprints, Eremite Games acknowledges that this could result in bloat. The random (near-roguelite) nature of Against the Storm requires that you make effective use of what’s available to you…]]></summary>

        <updated>2024-08-06T17:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here be dragons.
A couple of years ago, it was notable when the Switch remakes of Pokemon Diamond and Pearl were developed not in-house by Game Freak, but by a smaller Japanese support studio called ILCA. That remake project was actually ILCA’s first crack at being the lead developer on a game, and it soon followed this up early last year with One Piece Odyssey, an original JRPG based on the long-running franchise about wacky pirates. Now this release has finally made its way over to the Switch, and we’re happy to report that it’s made the jump almost entirely intact. Though it’s taken a bit of a visual hit, One Piece Odyssey still proves to be an enjoyable and accessible release that's a welcome addition to the Switch’s considerable RPG library.
The narrative in One Piece Odyssey is a sort of ‘bottle episode’ that follows the adventures of the Straw Hat Pirates crew after they shipwreck upon a mysterious island called Waford. Shortly after arriving, a mysterious figure takes away their power (cutely represented by everyone dropping from level 40 down to 1) and locks it away in various magical cubes scattered across the island. Even when they recover some of the cubes, the only way they can unlock the power contained within is through diving into illusory worlds crafted from their memories and reconquering trials they once faced, although events play out a little differently this time around because of how ‘fuzzy’ memory can be. The crew thus sets out through worlds based on the memories of some of their greatest struggles to reclaim their power and get to the bottom of what’s going on with this strange island.

I'm pretty sure not having eight gigs of RAM is heretical, but never fear, you can probably compensate by taking a leaf from the God-Emperor's book and arrange for a host of dying psykers to pour their brain energy into your motherboard.
All of which is to say that Focus Home have released the system requirements for huge-shouldered action game Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2. Find them proudly emblazoned across the header image above, and written out for easier copy-pasting in the blockquote, below.

We had Deviator last week - now, it's time for a bumper helping of the heebie-jeebies in the shape of Perennial Order. The title makes it sound like an eBay delivery of potted geraniums. The game festering beneath is actually a "plant horror" boss rusher with twin stick melee controls, unlockable "Instinct" abilities and one-hit deaths.
In a gift to headline writers everywhere, the developers, four-person Gardenfiend Games, are calling it "Hollow Knight meets Titan Souls", and who am I to deny them? It's got one of those "painterly" art styles, too, though other words come to mind, such as "rotted" and "unhallowed" and "manky". It's out on 6th September. Find a trailer nested below this paragraph like a venus flytrap poised to clamp around your fingers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Horka polevila, ale žár nadšení Strahováků z techniky nepolevuje! Za poslední měsíc se stalo několik událostí doslova kosmického charakteru. Došlo k úspěšnému startu a vypuštění sond z rakety Ariane 6, Boeing vyslal Starliner na oběžnou dráhu, kde nyní jeho pasažéři neplánovaně už druhý měsíc setrvávají. KiCAD má novou verzi a blíží se konference k jeho dalšímu vývoji. Objevil se nový čip kombinující RP2040 s ethernetem a povedlo se na čipu vytvořit pulzní safírové lasery. Jsou vám tyto novinky málo? Pak jsou na Virtuální Bastlírnu připravená i obecnější hardwarová témata!

Za HW lze probrat zajímavé nově objevené parazitní jevy v SiC MOSFETech, jak se dá operační zesilovač "zaseknout" nebo k čemu jsou dobré ztrátové koaxiální kabely a kde je sehnat. Samozřejmě bastlíři narazili i na kuriozity, například doutnavkovou logiku nebo plošňák, jehož součástí je ohýbačka na THT součástky.

Software ani tentokrát nezůstane stranou - kromě již zmíněné nové verze KiCADu se dá podívat na stavbu linuxového managovaného switche, NanoKVM, převod videa z DisplayPortu na eink nebo emulátor NESu na Picopadu.

Jak je zvykem, s postupem večera se jistě přejde i k lehce bizarním tématům - kupříkladu, co provedl CrowdStrike, jak zprovoznit Doom na erotických hračkách pro pány, jak vypadá nestandardní 12V USB nebo jak se ztrácí některé části audio záznamů z CD, protože je většina SW neumí správně přečíst.

Příští Virtuální Bastlírna se pod taktovkou projektu MacGyver studentského klubu SiliconHill bude konat ve středu 7. srpna od 20:00 minimálně do 22:00 (ale obvykle končí o dost později). Odkaz na konferenci se před samotnou akcí objeví na bastlířské wiki.]]></summary>

Cat Quest has been a beloved series for close to a decade now. From offering a unique world in the first game to adding co-op in the second, it has always tried to shake things up for the action-RPG genre. Cat Quest III feels like another switch-up for the series, taking what felt great about previous games and seeking to tell a charming pirate adventure that keeps you surprised. After sinking 15 hours into The Gentlebros' latest adventure, it is safe to say everything about Cat Quest III is fantastic.
The adventure began with us choosing our feline Purrivateer and arriving in the Purribean, an archipelago filled with Pi-rats to defeat who are on the hunt for the North Star Treasure. With our spirit companion, who is also searching for the North Star Treasure, we piloted our ship and ventured across land and sea to find the mythical treasure, defeating Pirate Lords in a variety of dungeons and uncovering a myriad of secrets along the way.

Those familiar with Nintendo hardware and its development codenames will know that the GameCube was once known as the 'Dolphin'. In fact, this is probably one of the more well-known codenames in console history, aside from maybe the 'Revolution' for the Wii and the 'NX' for the Switch.
A prototype of the GameCube had been known to exist, but the only photo of the fabled device was so blurry it could have potentially passed as a UFO or Bigfoot sighting. Now, however, we've got a fresh new look at the 'Nintendo Dolphin' courtesy of ConsoleVariations on social media. The account posted an image of the console with a clear view of the logo and disc tray.

My feelings about the series have settled back from self-righteous fury over its Pentagon-sponsored war-fellating to a quieter, regretful sense that there have maybe been enough Call Of Duty games now, and that it would be nice if we could fill that infamous late October/early November release slot with, I don't know, games about witches instead, or maybe just turn it into a public holiday and spend the week lying on a mattress regarding the ceiling. Still: I've skinned and filleted enough COD in my time to know that Black Ops 6's new "omnimovement" system is going to ruffle as many feathers as it smooths. The short version is that it turns you into Max Payne.

I think about this quite often, actually, as someone whose largely offline friends (or Fortnite/FIFA pals) ask me to recommend them a game that's good or interesting. Show them something popular like Elden Ring and, despite its grandeur, it might prove too much in all facets. But Vampire Survivors? It's an easy sell: simple, digestible, ridiculous value.
All of this is to say, One BTN Bosses is from the same school of the easy sell. You can fight bosses with one hand in a packet of pickled onion Space Raiders, after all.

You get your bearings, and you soon meet up with another, only slightly irritating, small child.

Leaves flutter, rays of sun cavort through trees, and the music is utterly gorgeous. The game opens on twinkly piano and mournful strings, infused with a good dose of stirring JRPG whimsy, and soon transforms into whatever the genre of music is called that makes you want to immediately go on a massive adventure. Potion-punk. Slime-swing. Limit breakcore etc.

I dunno about that, though between the Asus ROG Ally X and the Steam Deck OLED, those who stayed their hand on their earlier handheld gaming PC counterparts do have a couple of quality second-genners to choose from. Valve’s effort manages to wring multiple performance, design, and battery life improvements out of its new display, while the ROG Ally X makes similar upgrades with a bigger-yet-better take on the original ROG Ally.
The only thing to do, clearly, is make them fight. It’s probably in the Irish Code Duello or something: "Should one portable games box impugn another’s honour by releasing shortly after it, satisfaction must be claimed through a comparison article." My hands are bound here, folks, though if you yourself have been playing the waiting game on a handheld purchase, perhaps this little head-to-head can help you pick the right one.

You awake to a world of tree trunks that twist like viscera and corroded contraptions powered by luminous goop that’s stored in the balls, uh, big glass orbs. A beam of light soon fills your character with newfound vigour, which is a nice moment of triumph in what otherwise feels like a deeply oppressive rust pit, all unsteady platforms and jagged pipes.
It doesn’t take long before you start spotting examples of the reason Bionic Bay went viral earlier this week. Above your head hangs a painstakingly detailed mass of vents and cables, looming lifelike with dust and shadow and history. I stood and stared because I’d seen how the sausage was made, but I like to think I would have lingered longer than usual anyway. It really is just that impressive.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the neat things about Norland's fantasy medievalism is that specialist knowledge is tied to characters. So if there's only one person in your village who knows how to brew tastier beer, and they die after being freakishly savaged by a passing wolf (it happens), suddenly your village will have no artisanal lager master. The results may be devastating. Luckily, you can share knowledge in a number of ways - by copying books, or having "wise conversations". The exception to this is child characters, whose pea-sized brains can't learn specialist knowledge, only soaking up basic attributes like "manners" from the teachers you assign to them. Well, until now. The developers for the Rimworld-meets-Crusader Kings catastrophe simulator have made kids a little smarter. They'll now learn more important things from their adult teachers.

Baldur’s Gate 3 itself looks to be done and dusted following the upcoming patch, but Larian now seem to be gearing up for their next charm offensive with a new “community focused” YouTube channel, as well as further teasing their two games currently in development.

Friend, here is what driving games have taught me: traffic lights are there for regional flavour; drifting is the same thing as cornering; other cars exist to serve as bumper cushions when overshooting a turn. Certainly, nobody wants a guy whose ideas about automobiles come from 2018's Wreckfest to be involved in the school run. On which note: THQ Nordic have just announced Wreckfest 2 - a fresh helping of destruction derby with fancified visuals and newly animate drivers who flinch and gesticulate when other drivers smash into them. Witness the carnage in the announcement trailer below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's a hell of a thing to showcase a remake weeks after kiboshing the developers of the original game. In early July, Gothic creators Piranha Bytes were reportedly shuttered as part of Embracer Group's mad race to trim costs, following their decade-long acquisition binge. Watching THQ Nordic's new Gothic Remake trailer, below, feels a little like watching a vivisectionist parade about in somebody else's skin. Still, the remake's developers Alkimia Interactive aren't to blame for Embracer's fuck-ups, and I am selfishly happy to see Gothic return as an Unreal Engine 5 production - even if I didn't play the original back in 2001.


Sin did play the original game, and in her 2016 retrospective, she paints an absorbing picture of a dark fantasy "microsociety" in which every community "has a reason to exist, a means of providing for itself, a social order, and a long term goal". It's a setup that reminds me of my beloved Roadwarden, even as the sight of grumpy lizards slinking through undergrowth has me silently mouthing "fus roh dah".

No colons, no bespoke jargon, no tortuous subtitles like "Gaia's B.O.U.N.T.Y." or "Hyperion's Wild Rumpus" - just the steadying prospect of a titanic quest that, who knows, may involve actual titans. The action-RPG beneath the moniker appears similarly straightforward: it's about following a plot thread through a mythological world in top-down view, smashing Ancient Greek giga-crabs and the like to obtain shinier, pointier varieties of gear. I'm sure I don't need to tell you that there's an endgame in which you farm monsters for crafting materials.


Like Pandora opening her box, but without the accompanying tidal wave of sickness, curses and death, THQ Nordic have released a new trailer that talks you though all of this in detail. Here it is...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bungie have reportedly cancelled Payback, an unannounced project in the Destiny universe from former Destiny 2 game director Luke Smith and project lead Mark Noseworthy. Both Noseworthy and Smith appear to have lost their jobs in the course of Bungie's brutal cost-cutting this week, but Payback's cancellation pre-dates the layoffs. Envisaged as a Destiny spin-off, rather than Destiny 3, it was apparently dropped "a while ago".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The first World Of Goo was a cheerful parade of goopy engineering with a sense of never-ending novelty (well, never-ending for about four hours). Every level would introduce a new goo type or a twist on the basic bridge-building puzzle that challenged you to get a gaggle of gurgling balls to the nearest pipe. World Of Goo 2 pursues that sense of novelty with just as much twitchy eagerness as its predecessor, throwing new toys and goos at the player in an effort to keep you on your sludge-coated toes. That pursuit doesn't always result in pleasing new levels, though. There is a "hit and miss" feeling to things this time around. But those hits are hits. For anyone who has spent the last 16 years yearning for more sticky structure-building: I hope you like comically unpredictable fluids.

Now that Valve have shown it’s possible to quickly turn around an upgraded handheld without enraging owners of the original, Lenovo have hinted at a new Legion Go, MSI have revealed an improved Claw, and Asus have released this here ROG Ally X. A ROG Ally, again – but better? Yes, it is, in almost every way except the speed at which it’ll plunge you into financial destitution.

Now Mountaintop Studios, a new studio whose ranks include ex-Bungie and Respawn devs, have chucked themselves into the tactical FPS gauntlet with Spectre Divide. Made with input from former CS pro and streamer Shroud, it looks a bit like a mix of CS and Valorant, but has a big gimmick that sets it apart from the two: you can swap between two bodies.

According to Totilo, Bungie leadership "overstated their studio’s financial prospects to Sony" after the latter bought Bungie in 2022 for $3.6 billion. The latest cuts were necessary to prevent continued losses, says the report, after Bungie missed Sony’s targets following the release of last year’s Lightfall.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hardened battle royalists will remember Caldera, the sandy island map of bunkers and palm trees in Call Of Duty: Warzone. It got shut down last year as Activision focused their efforts elsewhere, making the map unplayable. But you can now revisit those bullet-strewn beaches. In theory, anyway. Activision have released it as a 4GB open-source project that can be explored in a 3D model-viewing tool. That's cool. But among their reasons for doing so, there lies a predictably grubby logic: they want people to use the data to train AI.

In my brief time with massive Fallout 4 mod Fallout London, I’ve read a delightful terminal entry about a scientist who named his favourite radiated shrew “Big Dave,” thwacked several of said Radshrews with a walking stick, gulped down some expired pink wafers, and been informed of train delays due to “leaves on the track.”
“A British transport joke!” I said to myself, marinating in the sufficient amount of crown-mandated mild amusement. “Our organ-floggingly expensive yet vital public services are crap!” I was having a good time. Then the game public transported me straight to my desktop, and continued to do so at regular intervals over the next few hours, ranging from “just as this conversation was getting good” to “just as my save was about to load.” My upper lip almost quivered, I tell you.

He yet survives, but mark my words: when the Woody Copters finally fall from their rusted hinges, I will salt the earth.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While he's "blown away" by the beach scenes in the first GTA 6 trailer, former Rockstar North technical director Obbe Vermeij thinks the forthcoming open worlder might underwhelm players hoping for a palpable technological update on GTA 5, which has been reworked and re-released extensively since its 2013 launch. This has less to do with GTA in itself, Vermeij says, than with the fact that changes in computing capacity today simply aren't as dramatic as in the days of the very first PlayStation. It's becoming rare, he suggests, that you see a "jump" akin to GTA going 3D.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Katharine (RPS in peace) thought Dome Keeper's blend of tower defence and mining was both "meditative" and "perfectly formed" in her review. So it comes as great news, then, that the devs have somehow taken that perfect dome, expanded it and polished it to an even greater sheen. We're talking about new guild assignments, new gadgets, better world generation, a new world, new monsters. The list is enormous and designed expressly around improved replayability - take that, Las Vegas Dome.

Among the wonderful sights contained in space-poking adventure game The Great Fluctus are: beans, slug milk, alien volleyball, egg arguments, and massive frog. Additional screenshots suggest this frog later acquires wings. Like a captive Generation Game host, I am helpless but to shout out more incredible sights as they flutter past on the conveyor belt of pure flippin' videogame before me. It’s got dance parties with horrible gorilla aliens. It’s got building, namely the Statue Of Liberty out of goop, just as George Washington’s goop clone intended. It’s also got just sitting on a bench, enjoying some lovely serene space scenery.  Feast your famished face on the trailer.

Specifically, laidback intercity services with nobody else in the quiet car and certainly, none of those screeching smaller bipeds, or "children" as they are scientifically known. That idyll is now lost to me thanks to Covid: I have vulnerable family members and continue to be careful about social distancing. As such I spend most train journeys these days lurking between carriages, trolling the door sensors and scowling furiously at anybody who visits the loo. But now, thanks to the obscene magic of video games, I can get my fill of authorial locomotivation once again.

In a pastime that’s had several decades to perfect the art of hitting men with sharp objects, that’s quite the accomplishment. Since releasing in 2022, Torn Banner have lavished the player base with free horses, angry peasants, and most recently, the Regicide update - hosting a climatic tete-a-tete between two angry crownmen. With work on No More Room In Hell 2 well underway though, Torn Banner have decided to call it on Chiv 2, which they now consider “feature complete.”

Original story:
Earlier this month it was reported that Skibidi Toilet, the YouTube phenomenon, may be heading to film and television via director Michael Bay. Now Invisible Narratives, a production company co-owned by Bay, has apparently sent a DMCA takedown notice to Garry Newman, citing the large number of Skibidi Toilet games and assets advertised within Garry's Mod.

Skibidi Toilet uses assets derived from Half-Life 2, however, and owes a lot to the Garry's Mod machinima scene. And the animation's original creator, best known as DaFuqBoom, is claiming innocence over the DMCA.

Whereas AMD’s first take on driver-level frame generation – the same kind of framerate-roiding image generation trickery that FSR 3 and DLSS 3 are based around – came yoked to a barrel of jittering, stuttering, and visual artefacting issues, Fluid Motion Frames 2 is as smooth and you’d like. Without compromising on the ability to deploy it in theoretically any DirectX 11- or 12-based game, too.

Peel back the curtains of American cultural hegemony however and you may find the true pulsing core of British comedy that lies beneath: innuendo. No American network is in a bidding war to import Vic and Bob or remake Bottom, and Carry On and Benny Hill are assumed to be anachronisms in our modern times, but Thank Goodness You're Here! enters the conversation with a nudge and a wink. It's a cheeky 2-3 hour adventure through a small northern town, and it's here to educate the entire world of our nation's obsession with sausages and bare bottoms.

I enjoy the militant reductiveness of this character motivation. There are sprawling underground ecosystems to discover, yes, weird plants to harvest, fractious clumps of tentacles to appraise, avoid or slaughter. But all of these things are contemptible details to be swept up and bagged and thrown in the dumpster.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[2024’s small but growing avalanche of games that trap you in a room with a nasty little freak continues with Arsonate, in which the nasty little freak wears a gasmask and wants to set you on fire. He wants to do this using cards. There are 47 of them - a forest of silhouettes, laid across the blood-stained table between you. Every turn, you flip a tree card to reveal a flame. When the flames spread to a player’s Tower card, it’s game over.

In India, the practice was elevated to a criminal offense last year and law enforcement is on high alert. A few days ago, a camming suspect was caught in the act after the filming angle of a previous upload, reportedly identified the cinema and a 'hot seat'.

Stumbling parched through a desert as a bed of scorpions prick your ankles with deadly venom?

You'll now be able to choose from several difficulty presets to dampen or spice up the game's challenge. Otherwise, there's new customisation options and some quality of life tweaks, too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Overwatch 2 director Aaron Keller has posted a lengthy blog on Steam about the transition from 6v6 player matches in the first Overwatch to 5v5 in the poorly received free-to-play sequel. It's a juicy read for armchair designers and lapsed Overwatchers like myself, packing in analysis of class roles and the shift from the free choice of heroes to single hero picks and enforced team compositions.
In broad strokes, Keller summarises how the Overwatch experience has drifted away from "player freedom and creativity in order to create a more balanced, consistent and competitive experience for players". It's possible, however, that Overwatch 2 will swing back in the other direction, as Blizzard are now "exploring how we can test different forms of 6v6 in the game to gauge the results", with a view to restoring some of the joyful chaos that saw entire teams of Reinhardts charging the objective in formation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The story of Mortal Kombat games in recent years has been a mish-mash of double-crosses, weird friendships, and alternate dimension wobbles. They often feel like a casualty of Marvel movie bloat. Mortal Kombat 1 was marketed as a "reboot", for example, but is really just a continuation of previous nonsense, with developers NetherRealm saying "I don't know, stick a multiverse in it." Yet from that multiverse now arrives another bad guy, bringing new story chapters for the fighting game's first big expansion, as well as extra characters like the liquid metal murderer from Terminator 2, a Conan of the barbarian persuasion, and the masked killer of the Scream movies.

Thus far, Eyeo GmbH, the company behind Adblock Plus, has come out on top. However, with Axel Springer's reformulated claims now rooted firmly in copyright law, the stakes are high at Germany's highest court. A long-running lawsuit involving Sony and a cheat device may yet hold the answers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a recent interview, the director of The Elder Scrolls Online said that if you made Morrowind today, it would struggle to find an audience. "If you play that right now," he said, "there is no compass, no map, literally the quests are like 'go to the third tree on the right and walk 50 paces west'... And if you did that now, no one would play it. Very few people would play it." Well sir, have you heard of a little open world RPG called Dread Delusion? It's pretty good. And what's more, it has just added a whole new area with - let me see - a giant floating squid creature with an entire town of citizens living inside its shell.

We first reported its appearance back in the dark ages of 2013. For context, that was the year Grand Theft Auto V came out. Whoa! Okay, calm down, sorry, I didn't mean to panic you. Yes, the arrow of time is inviolable. We are all marching steadily towards our graves, I know. But at least now 7 Days To Die has finally released its fully baked version 1.0.

An attendee at San Diego Comic-Con was looking at a set of figures based on characters from the series when they saw that the plaque accompanying the figures was labelled with the words "Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver 1 & 2 Remastered" alongside the logo for Crystal Dynamics.

It’s a relatively good-spirited delay, though: first off, it’s not that long, with the previously planned September 5th launch pushed back just a few weeks to November 20th. There’s also clever little in-universe announcement video (one which gives the fourth wall a study kick on its way out), and an accompanying promise of a meaty "developer deep dive video", set to reveal much more of the game’s radioactive hellscape on August 12th.

Not only from larger studios like Arkane, keeping the faith alive with their time loops and space stations, but also from a bunch of smaller developers bravely exploring a typically ambitious genre. RPS has always had an affinity for these systemically luxuriant simulations, historically lauding the likes of the original Deus Ex as the best game ever made. But given everything that has come since, is that still the case? Only one way to find out: make a big list.

But, despite all appearances, this one isn’t actually turn-based at all. A tiley, tiny real time strategy then? Aye, and one that’s actually pretty frantic as it happens. Missions are snappy, intense skirmishes. You’ll fight off waves while trying to protect your useless, freeloading command vehicle. This threat, combined with on-the-fly tactical consider-me-do's like utilising cover and keeping rock-paper-scissors matchups in your favour ends up spawning something quite distinct. Please, do stomp on, preferably with less hypens for all our sakes.
