        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As anyone who’s played Bethesda’s fantasy RPG might tell you, it can get lonely being the only Dragonborn in Skyrim. How wonderful, then, that one modder has bestowed upon the denizens of Tamriel’s chillest, chilliest province the ability to use their very own Dragon Shouts. Now any speaking NPC in The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim can let rip with a big old Fus Ro Dah and fire you straight into the sky, thanks to the Everyone Is The Dragonborn mod. Truly, egalitarianism in action.

We are just two weeks out from the launch of Square Enix' fantasy adventure Forspoken, and the publisher is ramping up its marketing drive with an evocative new cinematic trailer, spotlighting our hero, Frey, and the challenges that she faces in both this world and the next.
In the short cinematic, we see Frey on the run in two distinctly different scenarios, one in the avenues and alleyways of New York City, and then in the jungles and desert plains of the mysterious nation of Athia. Regardless of the terrain, the threat, and the motivation, Frey's goal remains the same: Survival. And, ultimately, when her back is against the wall, she will have no option but face her pursuers, and turn the hunters into the hunted.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6goMdDb4UQ&ab_channel=SquareEnix
Forspoken is an open-world fantasy adventure developed by Luminous Productions. While its protagonist is intriguing, its world lush and vibrant, and its special effects pretty durn dazzling, the new title appears to be struggling to light the hype fires and its publisher might hope. It has, admittedly, become incredibly trendy to rag on this game, but I'm, personally, still willing to give the title the benefit of the doubt, for now. Still, optimism will only carry a title so far, and the truth will out soon enough, when Forspoken finally makes it into the hands of the players.
Forspoken launches January 24 on PS5 and PC. Check out Chris Carter's thoughts on the demo here.

Next month, Tales of Symphonia returns to a Nintendo console when Tales of Symphonia Remastered launches on Switch (and other platforms) on 17th February. Ahead of that date, Bandai Namco and Nintendo have shared a gameplay trailer to bring newcomers up to speed on what to expect, and get long-time fans excited to dive back into a GameCube classic.
The new trailer will be familiar to those who've played the original on GameCube back in 2003. There are snippets of gameplay — from exploring towns to delving into dungeons (and yes, RPG fans, there's a sewer dungeon in there). But the big focus of the trailer is, understandably, the game's action combat.

Following the incredible global success of Capcom's Street Fighter II, it didn't take any time at all before the market was awash in one-on-one fighters, fast eclipsing the scrolling beat-'em-ups and shmups that had dominated the scene leading into the 1990s. All of a sudden, seemingly every developer pivoted to competitive fisticuffs, with seemingly hundreds of Street Fighter-alikes hitting arcade centers — many featuring developers and IPs seemingly plucked out of thin air.
And while a few of these releases would carve out a piece of the pugilistic pie for themselves — such as Mortal Kombat, Fatal Fury, and eventually The King of Fighters, there was a whole wave of titles that fell by the wayside. In most cases, this came down to the games being poorly prod…]]></summary>

Too many mods got waylaid in Planet Half-Life screenshot roundup hell by a desire to make everything expansive and professional-grade. So I'm delighted by a mod for 2017's Star Wars Battlefront 2 which knows its core: it is funny to see dinosaurs do things that dinosaurs shouldn't be doing. So the JurassicFront replaces character models with dinosaurs, and away you go, shooting dinos around Naboo and the Death Star. That's the joke.

Epic Games took to the @FortniteStatus Twitter account yesterday to announce that a period of game downtime was scheduled for this morning (10th January) to fix several mechanical issues. The maintenance was performed as planned and the Fortnite serves are now back online.
Of the many issues that the patch set out to tackle, the most prominent was with the recently-added Shockwave Hammer - a new weapon which had an easily exploited glitch to remove its cooldown period (thanks, Eurogamer). Ever since the weapon's addition in last month's Chapter 4 update, the hammer became a fan-favourite, but it was quickly removed from the game ('vaulted', as the kids say) for its glitches.

Publisher Deep Silver handed over development of the game to LittleBigPlanet 3 developer Sumo Digital in 2016, and then, in 2019, the company announced that Homefront: The Revolution developer Dambuster Studios would be developing Dead Island 2.

We knew it was coming, but it's something else entirely to see it in flashing neon lights on an official Xbox blog. Persona 3 Portable, Persona 4 Golden, and Monster Hunter Rise are all coming to Xbox Game Pass the week of January 16.
As Microsoft has now fully confirmed, none of these are seemingly delayed, and will arrive next week. All three marquee games are coming to the service with all platforms in tow, including cloud play; as well as on consoles and PC. Good luck to all of you who are playing these for the first time! They're each a massive time sink, but are worth it.
Here are the games coming to Xbox Game Pass in January of 2023
Persona 3 Portable, January 19 (Cloud, Console, and PC)
Persona 4 Golden, January 19 (Cloud, Console, and PC)
Monster Hunter Rise, January 20 (Cloud, Console, and PC)
Here are the games leaving Xbox Game Pass on January 15, 2023
There's a few big things leaving the service around the same time, however. Losing Danganronpa in any capacity is going to hurt. Then there's Nobody Saves the World (which was a timed console exclusive for the Xbox ecosystem), and the generally beloved Windjammers 2.
Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc (Cloud, Console, and PC)
Nobody Saves The World (Cloud, Console, and PC)
Pupperazzi (Cloud, Console, and PC)
The Anacrusis (Game Preview) (Cloud, Console, and PC)
We Happy Few (Cloud, Console, and PC)

Atari has shared some brand-new visuals for the return of its once-lost classic, Akka Arrh, which is being produced and completed by the legendary British game designer, Jeff Minter.
The shmup, created by Mike Hally and Dave Ralston, was originally due to be released in arcades in 1982 but was scrapped as it was considered too difficult during a test. This rerelease was announced back in December 2022; the unfinished prototype was included in Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration, but this new version — due to launch sometime this year — will be the complete package.

Unless you caught Katharine’s writeup on the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 Ti, which I did once I found a smidge of 4G signal. Cheers, chief.

The next 12 months is set to be a banner year for interstellar adventuring, and kicking us off in just under four weeks time on February 2nd is KeokeN Interactive's Deliver Us Mars. As I found out last year, Deliver Us Mars looks like it's going to be quite the step up from its prequel, Deliver Us The Moon, both in terms of its cerebral, pulse-racing puzzle-solving, and its shift from a silent, first-person protagonist to fully-voiced, third-person heroine, Kathy Johanson - a fact that game director and co-founder Koen Deetman tells me has been long in the making. 
"You have to bear in mind that Deliver Us The Moon was our debut into the games industry," he tells me. "We’d envisioned multiple ways to make this the greatest game of all time, but to some extent you are bound by reality and what you can make within a budget and timeline, so some of these decisions were made out of necessity. That’s why the narrative and its scale has significantly risen with Deliver Us Mars – we’ve had the opportunity to give that side of the game a lot of more of our time and attention."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Surprisingly affordable, starting at $400.
Since the Switch launched back in 2017, we've seen an influx of powerful, dedicated handheld systems that many have deemed to be 'rivals' to Nintendo's hybrid platform. We prefer to view them simply as alternative devices to potentially suit a wide range of gaming preferences, with products like the Steam Deck and the Aya Neo Next providing relatively approachable (albeit often quite expensive) solutions if you're after something to go alongside your Switch.
The latest premium handheld device to hit the market comes via hardware company Razer, which recently announced a release date of January 26th, 2023 for its portable Android and streaming console, dubbed the Razer Edge. Reservations can currently be made on the official Razer website for a fee of $5, with the prices starting at $399.99.

SNK has offered up some exciting news for its excellent tag-fighter The King of Fighters XV — Not only do we now know that new DLC character Shingo Yabuki will be returning as soon as next week, but the developer also revealed two more characters coming our way in 2023: The crime-fighting vigilante Najd and the terrifying Sylvie Paula Paula!
In an update the KoF XV's Season 2 roadmap, SNK revealed that its first DLC drop, consisting of Shingo Yabuki and a meaty balance overhaul, will go live on all platforms on January 17. The Kyo Kusanagi fanboy will be followed in the spring by veteran Fatal Fury star and bringer of JUSTICE Kim Kaphwan. Around this time, SNK also hopes to launch a beta for its crossplay servers, which are expected to officially open at some point later this summer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iuv9bxAVRCQ&ab_channel=SNKOFFICIAL
And speaking of the season, those warm winter months will see the return of KoF XIV debutantes Najd and Sylvie Paula Paula. Najd, as you might remember, was the winning entry in a "Design a Character" competition held by SNK back in 2018. As such, to see the mysterious vigilante make their return pays tribute to their designer, artist Mashael Al-Barrak. The absolute MENACE Sylvie Paula Paula is an incredibly loud, boisterous, and colorful NESTS operative, whose obnoxiously cutesy ways and dopey visage belies a dangerous killer instinct and literally electrifying fighting skills.
Honestly? Stoked to see her again.
Two further characters will launch in Fall and Winter 2023, respectively, to round out Season 2.
The King of Fighters XV is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox Series X platforms.

Masahiro Sakurai, the brilliant mind behind a library-full of our favourite Nintendo titles, has moved onto another development story in his latest YouTube video. This time, the discussion is all about Kirby Air Ride as the legendary creator discusses how the idea came to be, development challenges and the game's lasting influence today.
Air Ride was something of a sharp turn for the Kirby series (especially given its release around the time of the more conventional GBA titles Kirby: Nightmare in Dream Land and Kirby & the Amazing Mirror), but we think it's fair to say that this wacky racer twist on the pink puffball format worked.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good things come to those who wait
Fans of the modern classic farming simulator that is Stardew Valley, and likely its massive 1.5 update which added mountains of new content to the game, will be thrilled to hear that the expansion is finally available on mobile platforms. The update first released on PC back in 2020, and mobile players have been asking when they'll get a chance to check it out ever since. Eric Barone, the solo developer behind the title, tweeted out on January 6th that the 1.5 update had been submitted for review on iOS and Android platforms. The update had some issues in its first few days as players reported various bugs, but Barone has already rolled out at least one patch to fix the most glaring problems.
https://twitter.com/ConcernedApe/status/1611612814271184899
It's easy to miss, but in the thread of replies following that initial tweet, Barone said that the re-write of the game's app that was required to make the 1.5 update work should make things "easier to update mobile in the future (for 1.6 and who knows...)." We have no idea what the 1.6 update would entail — it could simply be more basic bug fixes, although the fans (myself included) would be happy to guess that it's another content update, or maybe even multiplayer.
Either way, it's great to see Barone still has plenty of love to give to his debut title, even as he's working on another upcoming release, Haunted Chocolatier.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Give me something to break.
Visco Corporation, responsible for shoot 'em up Andros Dunos (1992), was a Neo Geo stalwart, releasing 15 titles across SNK’s arcade and console hardware. One of its only forays into the fighting game arena was Breakers and its semi-sequel, Breakers Revenge. In 1996, the fighting game market was flooded. And, while it postdates Super Street Fighter II Turbo by two years, we always adored Breakers and felt it deserved wider recognition. Sadly, it never caught fire in arcades, struggling to be noticed, and never received an official home port outside of the Neo Geo CD.
The absolute best way to bring a 26-year-old fighting game back is by opening it up to the global stage, and on this front Breakers Collection gets it impeccably right. Featuring both Crossplay and an online versus mode buoyed by all-important rollback netcode, the game’s arrival on Switch has been a long time coming.

Maybe it's just me, but it feels like The Last of Us Part II, or Naughty Dog at the very least, have managed to stay in the news cycle since the sequel's release back in 2020. Of course, this is in large part due to the fact that HBO's adaptation of the series is coming up in less than a week now, and conversations about the televised take on the first game have been swirling for months. As a long time mega fan of the series, I'll have a lot of feelings to parse through once it's finally out, but until then, I can focus on the fun that's popping up around the series right now, like this mod that makes Ellie in The Last of Us Part II look exactly like Bella Ramsey, who is portraying the beloved character in HBO's live action versi…]]></summary>

The Matrix was red hot when I was in high school. I remember the anticipation my friends and I had for the upcoming Matrix Reloaded. I also remember the subtle disappointment that crept in when it was released. It wasn’t horrible, I guess it just wasn’t what we were hoping for. Matrix Revolutions kind of just nailed the coffin shut. What a dark time.
Around that time came Enter the Matrix, which probably still stands as the most ambitious attempt to tie a game into a movie series’ canon. The Wachowskis were heavily involved, the live-action cutscenes had the same look as the movie, and parts of the plot were heavily extrapolated in the game. From a narrative perspective, it fit so well, but when it came to gameplay, well…

Overwatch 2's Battle For Olympus event is live, and a pantheon of Greek god skins have stormed the store. One skin in particular has caused a stir over the last few days though, causing players to question whether they're paying for a disadvantage.
The Medusa skin for Widowmaker is what you'd expect: Overwatch's spider-themed sniper Widowmaker in Medusa garb. She takes on a serpentine appearance and, crucially, the locks of her hair become snakes.
These snake hairs aren't just for show; they actually hiss and make noise in-match. Which is a cool feature, that also lacks some subtlety when you might want it. Brian St. Pierre, also known as competitive gamer under the handle "Kephrii", posted about this skin last week.

A demo did indeed come out in December, but only on PS5 - and to very mixed reviews. It's a shame, because the world on show in its latest cinematic trailer looks appetisingly stylish. 
The game comes out on January 24th, so we'll know for sure soon enough.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[More Isaac for your buck
If you're keen on revisiting the Dead Space series ahead of the remake releasing this month, the Steam pre-order has a neat incentive. Pre-ordering the Dead Space remake on Steam before January 27 will net you the second game in the series, Dead Space 2, for free.
As spotted by VG247, the Steam pre-order has a special deal going. Picking up Dead Space through either its base version or slightly-more-expensive Digital Deluxe version will net you a free copy of Dead Space 2. And if you've already pre-purchased the remake, you should receive a copy of Dead Space 2.
While it might feel a bit disorienting to get the sequel to the original as a tie-in for the original's remake, this does net you two absolutely stellar sci-fi survival horror gems. The Dead Space series has garnered acclaim over the years, and for good reason. The first two are prime examples of action-oriented sci-fi horror. The third game? Well, that's a different story.

Space-based savings
It's a nice upside for those who want to dip back into the series ahead of the remake, or maybe have the second lined up to play after they finish the remake. That date isn't too far off, either. EA Motive's Dead Space is set to launch on January 27, 2023 for PC, as well as PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S.
While a remake of one of sci-fi's survival classics is already a strong pitch, survival horror fans are also probably hungry for Dead Space's return. The Callisto Protocol stumbled out of the gate at the end of 2022. And now, a remake of a major inspiration is just around the corner. It could be a big one for survival horror fans. We'll see how Isaac and the crew fare on new tech in just a few weeks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Anyone down for a 2D puzzle platformer?
YouTube personality videogamedunkey has made a name for himself on the internet with his game reviews/critiques and signature comedic style. Last year, Dunkey announced that he was going to be founding his very own games publishing studio known as Bigmode, and the news was met with mixed emotions.
It's been a little over four months since Dunkey's initial announcement, and now he has officially unveiled his first publishing partnership -- Bigmode will publish a game called Animal Well, a Metroidvania-inspired 2D puzzle platformer. Dunkey disclosed his deal with the game's developer, Billy Basso, in his newest YouTube video "Dunkey's Best of 2022." He says that the game is "one of the few at E3 [2022] that caught [his] eye," and that "it's a game coming from a very pure place of love for video games." That sentiment was one of the main reasons Dunkey cited for wanting to start a company like this in the first place, so I'm glad he's found a title to support that aligns with his values in that way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21T-Sc-TXJY
If you missed the conversation surrounding Dunkey's initial announcement of Bigmode, here's the gist: some fans were annoyed that in his announcement video, Dunkey implied that he was partially responsible for the success of games like Cuphead, Undertale, and Celeste because he promoted them on his channel. Regardless, Dunkey clearly has a strong vision of the kind of games he wants publish, and while he lacks experience on the development side of the games industry, I'm looking forward to seeing if he can carve his own path in a different part of the industry.

They literally ripple with muscle, run faster than we ever could, and could end your life with a single kick. Now imagine if they were also covered in fire.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's Grime Time
It's almost time to break out the rubber gloves and the big ol' bucket, as FuturLab has announced a release date for the PlayStation and Nintendo Switch ports of its ultra-satisfying release PowerWash Simulator — the viral cleaning sim hits the console platforms on January 30, as noted on PlayStation Blog.
For those less inclined, (or less uncleaned), PowerWash Simulator launched on PC and Xbox platforms in the summer of 2022 to immediate success, having taken the simple act of jet-washing houses, cars, playgrounds, trailers, and other locations and vehicles and turning it into a surprisingly compelling, relaxing, and enjoyable digital pastime. Do a good job, and players can earn money to improve their equipment and business, becoming the best cleaning company on the block.
https://youtu.be/nIdOILxKsBA
We are yet to know exactly what form the new ports will take, but one can at least assume that the base game from its launch will be included, and perhaps a deluxe edition featuring any of the title's post-release DLC. It will certainly be neat to take PowerWash Simulator mobile — say via the Nintendo Switch port.So if you're looking for a title to while away the small hours before bed, or just something to chill out to, be sure to give it a squirt.
PowerWash Simulator launches January 30 on PlayStation and Nintendo Switch. It is available right now on PC and Xbox platforms.

Unfortunately, while superhero movies have improved dramatically over the last decade, superheroes haven’t been as powerful in the realm of video games. In fact, nearly 40 years after the first superhero video game, many developers still struggle to create worthwhile experiences using some of the biggest names in entertainment today.
While not all superhero games are monumental duds like Superman on Nintendo 64, many tend to deliver middling, forgettable experiences. However, a select few that defy the stereotype to become superb titles we still look back on fondly as not only great superhero games, but terrific video games in their own rights.

Microsoft is currently running an ad in The Washington Post publicly declaring its pro-unionization stance.
The advert, co-signed by the Communication Workers of America (CWA), references the recently recognized ZeniMax Workers United branch, formed of over 300 employees within ZeniMax Media's QA department last week. Microsoft offered no resistance to the union vote following a deal made with the CWA wherein MS will remain neutral on all unionization matters in return for gaining the CWS's approval on its proposed acquisition of publisher Activision Blizzard.
In the Washington Post advert, Microsoft openly states its plan to encourage unionization with Activision Blizzard, should the purchase be completed. Ultimately, this is most likely the key …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Double-stuffed with cosmetics
A new crossover is bringing some Oreos flavor to games. Xbox and Oreos are teaming up for a special-edition cookie design, with both a change in the cookie and some in-game cosmetics for several Xbox games.
The promotion is taking place in 22 countries, which Xbox specifies as Europe only. Sorry to any North American fans or other regions looking to get the special cookies.
These specific cookies will feature the Xbox logo and the A, B, X, Y button layout, as well as a directional arrow. By scanning the cookies and cracking the combination, players can unlock prizes for games. Entering the symbols in the correct sequence will unlock special, exclusive Oreo-themed content for games like Halo Infinite, Forza Horizon 5, and Sea of Thieves.
[caption id="attachment_357256" align="alignnone" width="640"] Screenshot via Xbox[/caption]
The codes are meant to be inspired by cheat codes hidden in games throughout history. That does make me curious if a Konami code input is hiding somewhere in all those Oreo cookies.
The special cookies are expected to be available in participating regions this month, and available while stocks last. If you want to participate, you can visit the Oreo site and check here to see if your country is taking part. (Reminder, this is a Europe-only event.)
Funnily enough, Oreos have tied into video games before now in some fun ways. The Pokemon limited edition Oreos bore the likenesses of some of the series' most well-remembered Pokemon. But this one, letting you discern special cheat codes from the cookies themselves? Well, that's pretty neat. At least until you eat the cookies before remembering to check the symbols.

A new rumor hit the community of Behavior Interactive's Dead by Daylight this weekend, suggesting that one of its popular Hunters — Leatherface of The Texas Chain Saw Massacre fame — might be preparing to take on his final slaughterthons in the assymetrical slasher.
According to a moderator from the sneaky-leaky DbDLeaks Discord, the license for Leatherface is about to reach its conclusion, with no suggestion that the developer, or publisher, are prepared to renew the contract for yer boy Bubba. The rumor, though not confirmed, seems snug, as Leatherface will soon be making his hammer blows felt in his very own assymetrical title, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, which is currently in development at Sumo Digital.

Scheduled to launch later in 2023, and published by Gun Interactive, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre will see players on the run from the terrifying Sawyer family, consisting of The Hitchhiker, The Cook, and, of course, Leatherface himself. As such, one would assume that this title would have the exclusive rights to the saggy-pants psychopath, and would rather he wasn't making an appearance in other games, especially one so immediately similar to its own.
Behavior Interactive is yet to comment on the rumor, but we'll be sure to update this story once we know the official score. For now, it seems, Dead by Daylight Leatherface mains should probably get their "fill" of Survivors, before their favorite run 'n' revver goes jogging through the woods for pastures new.
Dead by Daylight is available now on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and mobile platforms.

It’s very in line with what the studio is known for - creating beautiful handcrafted worlds complete with stories about nature - but with Tiny Echo, instead of making an animal game featuring a group of cute critters trying to survive the brutal wilderness (and that most likely made you cry), the Stockholm team went completely left-field and created a bite-sized ethereal puzzler that deals with ghosts and spirits.

Zelda: Breath of the Wild has been around for a while, and all sorts of hacks and glitches have arisen as a result of the march of time (and perseverance). The Gaming Reinvented YouTube channel managed to break down a step by step guide on the process, which is actually much simpler than expected: and doesn't require modding of any kind.
Here are the things you need to have ready to go for the Breath of the Wild glitch:
Upgraded Sheikah Sensor
A save near a Goddess Statue
At least one Hyrule compendium entry
The Camera Rune
Access to Hyrule Castle
From there you'll head to the bridge just before you enter Hyrule Castle (which is right before the map changes into the castle itself). Then, hold the shield button, press A, and view the regular map. Go to the rune list, and select the Camera Rune while scrolling back to the map. The glitch will essentially show the compendium constantly on-screen while it is active, so you know it worked. To get the infinite stamina and invincibility state, there's more to juggle. You can find the full glitch instructions in Gaming Reinvented's video below.
Obviously invincibility is a boon, but infinite stamina is really the golden goose here. After one has essentially 100%ed the game, it would be fun to use a mod-free way to just explore anything you want.

Oh, and even though Dead Space 2’s been available for more than a decade you’ll have to wait until the Dead Space remake goes live to play your complimentary copy.

Unlike the standard PS5 DualSense controller, however, Project Leonardo won’t be compatible with the PC when it eventually launches.


In a response to tech site Digital Trends, Sony Interactive Entertainment confirmed that the kit – which allows for extensive customisation of button layouts and joystick positioning – will be built exclusivly for the PS5, with no native support for the PC or older consoles like the PS4.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Adaptation approaches wrapping phase
It seems that Lionsgate's live-action adaptation of apocalyptic shooter Borderlands is almost in the can. As reported by Deadline, the bombastic-sounding sci-fi flick has entered its reshoot phase, bringing in a new pair of eyes to put the finishing touches to what sounds like a particularly wild cinematic adventure.
While gorehound Eli Roth is credited as the director of the adaptation, the Hostel lensman has left the project at the final hour, as he has finally received the go-ahead to start work on his slasher throwback Thanksgiving — a project that Roth has been trying to get off the ground for well over a decade. Lionsgate has brought in Deadpool's Tim Miller to direct reshoots for Borderlands, with Deadline reporting that situation is extremely amicable between all parties.
Based on the pulpy video game series, Borderlands features an all-star cast as the band of rag-tag reprobates on the search for hidden treasure in a desolate and dystopian universe. As we have previously reported, the new film stars Cate Blanchett as world-weary outlaw Lillith, Kevin Hart as disgraced mercenary Roland, Jamie Lee Curtis as the unpredictable scientist Tannis, Ariana Greenblatt as cutesy bomb-lovin' maniac Tiny Tina manic explosives expert Tiny Tina, (along with her protector, Krieg (Florian Munteanu). The party of anti-heroes will be joined by wise-ass robot Claptrap who will be voiced by Jack Black.
Borderlands, as an incredibly visual franchise, has a lot of potential for its big-screen transition. With capable hands both behind and in front of the camera, it could prove to be a pretty darn entertaining venture. Projects such as these are not always the sum of their parts, but here's hoping that the finished film offers an authentically chaotic slice of interstellar action when its raggedy curtain finally rises.

Love it or hate it, weapon durability is a feature that will likely never go away in games, and that's okay because when it's done right, it can be a helpful way to push players toward something new. In 2011's Dead Island, weapon durability was a big part of the experience, and that feature will return in Dead Island 2 when it hits PlayStation and Xbox consoles, and PC, on April 2…]]></summary>

"There is no doubt that we experienced some challenges since the launch of our game, particularly with regards to in-game matchmaking and lag. We deeply apologize for these issues that may have caused an inconvenience to our players," reads a statement from developer SuperTrick Games.

We've updated this list with a couple more feel-good games to help get you through any New Year blues. Enjoy!

Blue Monday. No, not just a kick-ass New Order song, but the name coined by marketers for the third Monday in January (or the first, or the second — all January Mondays it seems!), which is purportedly the 'most depressing day of the year'. While the genesis and questionable 'science' behind this dreary moniker is smirk-worthy, looking after your mental health is something everyone should take seriously and games are a great way to help get you in the right mindset.

When it comes to big movies, you might expect the official trailers to be the ultimate source of narrative information and plot detail. But when it comes to Illumination's The Super Mario Bros. Movie, the McDonald's leaks have been one of the most prominent outlets for letting us know what is going down in the Mushroom Kingdom.
From that initial reveal of Mario's appearance to hinting at an unannounced character cameo, we have learnt far more from the fast food retailer about Mario and the gang than we would care to admit. Of course, the biggest source of this information has come in the shape of the famous Happy Meal toys, with the promo leaks gifting us a constant stream of rumour while we wait for the next trailer to drop.

Strap yourselves in for another glitch from The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, folks!
This latest game-breaking trick comes courtesy of Gaming Reinvented (via users Simaubaka and LegendofLinkk) and essentially provides Link with invincibility and unlimited stamina, if executed successfully. Gaming Reinvented breaks down the glitch into two "phases", the first being the 'Inventory Storage' glitch, which effectively forms the basis of the whole shebang, and the second being the 'Aqua Reverse Memory Storage' phase (or "ARMS", if you like).

We're just over a month away from the grand opening of Super Nintendo World at Universal Studios in Hollywood. The theme park will be opening its doors to the public on 17th February 2023, but a few lucky members of the press and theme park enthusiasts have been given access and posted exclusive footage of the attractions.
Theme park YouTube channel MiceChat is one of the lucky few who have been able to have a look around the park ahead of its opening day next month. And the channel has shared around 2 minutes of footage from its tour. We've posted the video (along with another impressions piece) further down, but for those of you who don't want to see the theme park before it opens — or before you can visit yourselves — consider this a spoiler warning!

Directly inspired by the Nintendo GameCube, the joy-pad features Hall Effect analogue sticks to eliminate drifting, along with interchangable joystick rings, a turbo function, illuminated 'ABXY' buttons, and an ergonomic, slip-free design. It goes without saying, of course, that the controller also functions as a set of joy-con; simply slide the two sides from the pad and whack them directly onto your Switch.

The final whistle has blown on this weekend's Splatoon 3 splatfest, and, as a posse of tired and sticky squid kids and octolings return to the locker room, the points have been tallied up and now have an official winner in the battle of Spicy vs. Sweet vs. Sour: Scoop yerself a victory ice-cream Team Sweet!
Yes, it appears that fans of the sweetest of treats took home the gong this weekend, walking away with a massive 30 points in total, double that of its closest competitors, Team Spicy (15 points), and way ahead of third-place winner Team Sour (12 points).
Perhaps most importantly of all, this latest result has given Splatoon 3 host Frye her first splatfest win ever! The fans had been starting to feel a little sorry for her in recent weeks, as she had been yet to rack up a splatfest victory when compared to her colorful co-hosts, so it's nice to see this particular Deep Cut band member finally have their moment of glory.
Congratulations to the hard-paintin' players of Team Sweet. Make sure that you remember to go and pick up your rewards from the town square, oh, and make sure that you remember to brush your teeth three times a day. All of the sugar comes with one helluva price.
Splatoon 3 is available now on Nintendo Switch.

With no big new releases to speak of, this week's UK boxed charts paints a very similar picture to what we might expect (bar the switch of positions three and four, the first nine places are identical to last week). While God of War Ragnarok continues to sit on the top spot with the likes of FIFA 23 and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II in positions two and three respectively, it has been yet another strong week for Nintendo.
Once again, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is Nintendo's top scorer in fourth place. This is something that we have become used to as of late, but with the game nearing its 300th week in the charts (this is its 298th), the stats continue to dazzle.

When it comes to the development and publishing of sports simulators, there are no two bigger names in the game than EA Sports and 2K Sports. These companies are behind the best-selling football, basketball, hockey, and soccer games every year. There is just no competition when it comes to creating authentic, microtransaction-laden sports titles. Of course, not everyone cares about sports games for their realism. Some people just want to pick up a ball and have some good ol' fashioned arcade fun. And in that arena, Nintendo sports games are king.

Happy new year readers! Okay, so we're over a week into 2023 already — you might be moving on from last year, trying to look ahead to the best to come. But we just need to look back at 2022 one last time for the best eShop games in December.
Now, December is normally a quiet month for game releases — but Nintendo had to drop five short little indie showcase videos in its festive House of Indies series right before Christmas. Some of those had shadow drops in them which made our wallets feel even lighter than usual at this time of year. We're truly spoilt!

We must admit: Zelda rankings tend to look a little samey, perhaps with a few spicy changes based on the person. But you'll never find Breath of the Wild at the bottom, or Tri Force Heroes at the top, even if the person making that list is the world's most contrary list-maker.
So, we've been mixing things up by celebrating the individual successes that each Zelda game has, and highlighting the incredible things that can be found in each one (even if the rest of the game is a bit duff). We've already ranked every version of Fairy Fountain, ranked all the instruments that Link gets to play, and figured out the 15 best dungeons in the series — and now, we're onto boss battles!

Now a proposed settlement has been approved by a federal judge in California's Central District. The settlement reached will see CDPR pay out $1.85 million USD (around £1.52m GBP), or roughly $0.49 per eligible share.

Cozy farming and community simulators are some of my all-time favorite game genres. At the best of times they're a fun, relaxing world I can get lost in, and at the worst of times, they feel like a lifeline that's keeping me from spiraling out. First it was Stardew Valley, then it was Animal Crossing: New Horizons, and now Disney's Dreamlight Valley has taken over my gaming time. It's got everything you could ever want: adorable critters you can pet, delicious foods that'll have your mouth watering (I'm looking at you, Peanut Butter Waffle), and of course, all of your neighbors are beloved Disney characters.
With a whole flood of farming sims taking over in the past few years, we've seen a lot of different takes on the tried-a…]]></summary>

When FromSoftware announced Armored Core VI Fires of Rubicon at The Game Awards in December, a few very predictable things happened. Fans of FromSoftware's more recent output wondered whether or not this weird mech thing had anything to do with Dark Souls. Fans of Armored Core awoke from their decade-long coma to become immediately defensive, clarifying that Armored Core is a lot older than the Souls superseries, and that the two have nothing in common.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gal-Ag-Ah?
Following on from last week's addition of Taito's iconic Bubble Bobble, Hamster has got another pioneering classic lined up for that Arcade Archives, in the form of Namco's legendary shmup Galaga, now available to download on PS4 and Nintendo Switch.
Launched in 1981 as the sequel to the genre-defining Galaxian, Galaga is one of the most instantly recognizable titles of the formative years of the arcade. Players control a lone ship, piloting through the stars and taking on the invading forces of Galaga. Building upon Galaxian's award-winning action, Galaga offered an improved audio/video package, as well as cool new features such as the famous "Tractor Beam" enemy, and the ability for both the player and the enemy to morph into boosted variants of themselves.
Check out the classic interstellar action in the video below, courtesy of YouTuber World of Longplays.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29VVkfuXkVI&ab_channel=WorldofLongplays
Designed and developed by a small team within Namco, led by Shigeru Yokoyama, Galaga far surpassed the company's expectations, gaining the attention of the executives, which lead to increased efforts in marketing and shipping of the finished product. Galaga was a global smash on release, and would continue to be a mainstay of arcade centers well through the crash and into the late '80s. A gaming icon, Galaga has popped up in multiple movies — including WarGames, The Karate Kid, and The Avengers — and has even had an extinct species of prehistoric shark named after it!
Not a bad legacy at all for some old-school pew-pew action.
Galaga is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at around $8.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A picturesque new story is on the way from the OPUS team
Developer SIGONO has been making some waves with its narrative adventures, and now the team has announced its next project. OPUS: Prism Peak is a new game from SIGONO, and it's taking a look through a camera lens for its story.
SIGONO has developed several different narrative adventures under the OPUS banner, stretching back to 2016's OPUS: The Day We Found Earth. The Taiwanese studio found some breakout success with 2021's OPUS: Echo of Starsong, which received both audience critical acclaim, and found its way to the Switch with the Full Bloom Edition.
With OPUS: Prism Peak, the studio seems like its looking towards the camera for a new perspective. With the tagline "Capture the moment, then learn to let go," it certainly seems poised for some powerful emotions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdMesmRJRNQ
According to its Steam page, OPUS: Prism Peak is an adventure where choices will lead to diverging endings, as you play a photographer lost in an ethereal realm. You'll have to use your camera to uncover mysteries and find a way home through all of it.
The camera eye
Not much more information has been shared just yet, but the premise alone is very intriguing. The camera has become a cool way of viewing video game worlds, whether on the arcade-like railways of Pokemon Snap or snapping shots of the final days in Umurangi Generation.
With a team like SIGONO behind it, OPUS: Prism Peak could be another one to watch in the realm of camera-based adventure. Hopefully we'll hear more about this project soon. Meanwhile, that leaves plenty of time to check out the other OPUS games.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We all scream for Scream Tail
The competitive battling scene in Pokemon Scarlet & Violet has been fascinating to watch. As new strategies have formed around the monsters introduced in Generation 9, top-tier battlers have had their work cut out for them trying to counter the emerging threats. Who could have guessed that Maushold had some of the highest damage potential in the game? Or how about Murkrow becoming one of the most used Pokemon?
As it turns out, the competitive scene faces another significant shakeup. Courtesy of Serebii, Paradox Pokemon will officially be removed from the ban list when Series 2 of Scarlet & Violet’s Ranked Battle modes begin on February 1st. This includes 14 endgame monsters that feature near-legendary base stats and powerful abilities. Even one Pokemon has the potential to change the metagame completely, so the addition of Paradox Pokemon will almost assuredly send ripples throughout the scene. Smogon, a hub for fan driven competitive Pokemon play, already ruled two of these Pokemon too powerful for its popular 6v6 singles format.
[caption id="attachment_357146" align="alignnone" width="640"] Screenshot by Destructoid[/caption]
Some still can't join
Paradox Pokemon will be the only new monsters in Series 2. Tera Raid exclusives like Charizard and Cinderace are still off the table for Ranked Battles. Furthermore, the Ruinous Quartet and Legendary Pokemon remain off-limits. Still, we’re bound to see entirely new strategies emerge with these monsters entering the fold. Pokemon that have seen no usage so far may become valuable strictly to counter these new threats.
Pokemon Scarlet & Violet have been critically contentious, but the interest in the official competitive scene is as strong as it has ever been. Even non-battlers can have fun watching how Paradox Pokemon fit into high-end play. Series 2 will run until March 31st, 2023.

NetEase has picked up a new studio in SkyBox Labs. The established studio, known for co-developing on some major games, joins NetEase's growing roster of games studios.
SkyBox Labs has co-developed on several big projects, including Halo Infinite and Minecraft. It will continue to operate independently, and plans to work with both existing and new partners to continue co-developing games.
Shyang Kong, a co-founder of SkyBox Labs, said in a press release that the team will remain committed to growing its presence in Canada, on top of supporting current and future partners and undertaking more co-development projects.
"We have built a team of talented individuals who are passionate and creative, and by joining NetEase Games, we will also be able to accelerate our plans to pursue new creative opportunities, and enjoy access to world-class operational resources and the full breadth and depth of NetEase’s services so we can scale faster in Canada," said Kong.

A growing roster
NetEase has been picking up quite a few studios over the last few years, including Detroit: Become Human developer Quantic Dream and Suda51's Grasshopper Manufacture.
The tech company has also built up a roster of new studios, too. NetEase established Jackalope Games last year in Austin, with former Daybreak head Jack Emmert at the helm. Yakuza creator Toshihiro Nagoshi also established a new development house, Nagoshi Studio, under NetEase after leaving Sega.

Among Us has been one of the biggest games in the world since it blew up at the start of the pandemic in 2020 — its staying power is evidenced by its cameo in Rian Johnson's latest whodunit flick Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery. Even with all the clout that still surrounds the game, it was still dethroned by another social deduction game that takes enough inspiration from Among Us that it's bordering on rip-off territory: Goose Goose Duck.
That's right, a game that basically just swaps out Among Us' signature bean-shaped crewmates with goofy-looking geese has surpassed the original's record for concurrent players — Among Us peaked at 447,476 players two years ago, while Goose Goose Duck had a peak (or should I say beak?)…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Save data will be transferable to the full game
Bandai Namco's shonen RPG One Piece Odyssey goes live a week from now. But if you can't wait that long, there's also a demo arriving for One Piece Odyssey next week to tide you over until launch.
Producer Katsuaki Tsuzuki announced in a new video today that a One Piece Odyssey demo will go live on January 10, just ahead of its January 13 launch date.
The demo will cover roughly the first couple hours of One Piece Odyssey, and save data from the demo will transfer over to the full game. It will follow Luffy and the crew washing up on the island where Odyssey takes place, coming face-to-face with new obstacles to overcome, and likely plenty of RPG battles.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bBWs1dYFwk
Tsuzuki says the demo will highlight specific parts of what makes Odyssey a bit different, including its RPG bend towards tactical battles rather than action-heavy fights. The producer does note that since RPGs tend to have various elements unlock gradually over time, not all of the features can be discovered in the demo version.
Specifically, the memory worlds shown so far won't be in the demo. These are areas that let the Straw Hat Pirates revisit pieces of their past, going back to old memories of places to relive them. Those will be available after the demo version.
Setting sail
While it's a short span of time between demo and launch, this is at least a good chance to try out One Piece Odyssey to see if it's for you. While One Piece is no stranger to more action-oriented adaptations, Odyssey dives into the realm of RPGs. It's an interesting twist, and one that actually has me—an anime and RPG fan who doesn't normally vibe with One Piece—fairly interested.
The chance to try it out will arrive on January 10. Otherwise, One Piece Odyssey sets off on January 13 for PC, PlayStation 4, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.

It's about adding symbols to a slot machine, rather than removing monsters from a dungeon. You emerge from each run with sentences less like 'damn, if only I'd picked more block cards' and more like 'damn, if only I hadn't invested so much in coal and instead focused on feeding milk to my cats'.

In doing so they seem to have broken the cleanse effect attached to her Swift Step ability, meaning she can no longer purge debuffs. The bug appeared after yesterday's update and isn't mentioned in the patch notes, so yep, it's a bug rather than a balance change. Hopefully she'll get back to cleansing soon.

You're Hilda, a stabby lass who, for reasons, must investigate and lift a curse from a big ol' fantasy city. By exploring its districts and stabbing lots of weird dudes. Aiding you is a network of semi-suspicious locals, and the kind of immortality that makes death more annoying than anything. It's a hybrid, really, of a Souls-ish game and a more traditional hack and slash action RPG. Regular attacks don't consume stamina, and instead of finding or buying weapons, you start out with a complete set, and swap their movesets in and out as needed. I respect that it picks and chooses soulsy elements instead of tracing over the whole design.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I knew Minecraft had an ending, but I didn't know that ending consists of an unskippable 9 minute long poem. I also didn't know that last month the author of that poem, Julian Gough, placed it into the public domain, which according to him he's legally entitled to do because nobody at Mojang or Microsoft ever successfully got him to sign a contract.
He now says Microsoft are stonewalling any attempts to contact them about whether or not they own the copyright, and that this silence killed a piece he'd written for an unnamed "global news organisation" because they didn't want to risk drawing the ire of Microsoft's 1700 strong lawer team. That piece was actually an edited version of Gough's blog post from last month, where he explained the situation and submitted the poem to the public domain - while making multiple references to the poem being written by the universe, and also how taking psychedelics lead him to conclude that not allowing himself to be compensated would be a "blockage of the flow of love". It's a trip.

That's how I felt hearing about OPUS: Prism Peak this morning, the latest game from Taiwanese developer Sigono in their loosely-connected series of jaw-droppingly pretty visual novels. Described as a spiritual sibling to their most recent OPUS game, the brilliant Echo Of Starsong, the exact magic combo of words that made my eyes go all wide and saucer-like was "a cross between What Remains Of Edith Finch and Makoto Shinkai films", which just - you know what, I'm going to shut up now so you can watch the teaser trailer.

If you’re unfamiliar, Forge is a long-time Halo mode that allows players to create their own custom maps and modes. In the past, players used Forge to remake classic maps or remix existing ones. But Infinite’s take on Forge is more robust, allowing forgers to create maps that don’t look like they belong in Halo. No, seriously, what is Whiterun doing in Infinite?

When I first asked the team to put together their most anticipated games for 2023, I was thinking we'd have a reasonably sensible number of things we were all looking forward to, you know, somewhere in the region of the 43 games we highlighted at the start of 2022. Very quickly, though, it became apparent that, actually, there are simply loads of games the RPS Treehouse is personally excited about this year, and cor, it would be rude not to include every last one of them. I'll be upfront: there are a fair number of TBA games on here that probably aren't going to come out in 2023, but as ever, we remain hopeful and optimistic all the same. So let's dive in.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Don't expect The Last of Us HBO show to extend beyond the story of the two games in the series. That's because The Last of Us game director Neil Druckmann says there are no plans for stories beyond the games in this show.
This news comes by way of a new interview with Druckmann from The Hollywood Reporter, as reported by GameSpot. Here's what Druckmann told THR specifically: "We have no plans to tell any stories beyond adapting the games. We won't run into the same issue as Game of Thrones since The Last of Us Part: II doesn't end on a cliffhanger." 


Druckmann and TV series writer Craig Mazin have mentioned that a second season of this show might cover the events of The Last of Us Part II (personally, I think The Last of Us Part II could cover two seasons of television). Despite the duo not wanting the show to go beyond the games, there might be a way for the show to cover more ground after the events of The Last of Us Part II. If Naughty Dog were to develop a theoretical The Last of Us Part III, it wouldn't be surprising if the HBO show covered that down the road. Chances seem pretty good considering Druckmann told THR that there is "more story to tell" in the world of The Last of Us games. 
Mazin also touched on his desire not to extend the show beyond the games in the THR interview, as noted by GameSpot, stating that he doesn't "have any interest in a spinning-plates-go-on-forever show." 
"When it becomes a perpetual motion machine, it just can't help but get kind of...stupid," he continued. "Endings mean everything to me." 
For more about The Last of Us on HBO, read our interview with Joel actor Pedro Pascal and Druckmann about the changes made for this TV show. Check out this new piece of concept art from The Last of Us multiplayer game that Naughty Dog is currently developing after that.

Players control Kai, a lone warrior battling an evil robotic army in a post-apocalyptic world. This side-scrolling action title boasts plenty of satisfying action thanks to Kai’s fun melee combat, nimble platforming abilities, and his signature grappling hook, which he uses to traverse levels as well as yank and toss enemies. Sporting great 16-bit art and a strong soundtrack, Gravity Circuit is worth keeping an eye on for fans of classic throwbacks. 
Join editors Wesley LeBlanc and Marcus Stewart as they explore Gravity Circuit’s free Steam demo and discuss why it may be one of the year’s most exciting indie gems.

Many JRPGs have slow openings, taking their time to establish the story and familiarize the player with the mechanics before letting them loose into the world. I figured that was the case after playing an hour of Dragon Quest Treasures, so I said to myself, “It’ll get good soon!” I said it again two hours in, three hours in, and five hours in, until eventually, I was forced to accept that this was as good as the game would get.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We’re approaching the end of 2022, and we’re concluding the year by going back to our Super Replay roots by tackling an old-school survival horror game. In this case, we’re replaying one of the greatest games of the PS1 era, Silent Hill! Join us live on Twitch today at 2 p.m. Central as we endure two hours of nostalgic, hair-raising scares. If you can’t catch us live, each episode will be available to watch on Saturdays on the Game Informer Shows YouTube channel. 
Episode 1 - The Harry Mason Shuffle
Episode 2- When Doves Cry
Episode 3 - Bible.
Episode 4 - Age Seven, Short, Black Hair
Episode 5 - Map Daddy
Watch on Twitch!
In 1999, Konami put the fear of fog in a generation of players with the release of Silent Hill. The eerie title eschewed the more bombastic horror of its main rival at the time, Resident Evil, in favor of more psychological frights. Protagonist Harry Mason must embark on a terrifying search for his missing daughter, Cheryl, within the eerie town of Silent Hill. What unfolds is a descent into madness that kickstarted a franchise that's (finally) returning to the limelight after years of dormancy. Join me, Marcus Stewart, along with Kyle Hilliard, as we survive Silent Hill’s debut adventure and see how its scares stack up 23 years later.

Instead of leading the country of Sordland, this time players will guide the government propagandist Orwin through the city of Holsord, as you make tough decisions, befriend NPCs, and keep your family safe.

Granted, my gaming tastes wax and wane over a year, with lengthy JRPG stints rolling inevitably into junk food like Assassin's Creed Valhalla. No matter what, my one constant is an FPS or 'competitive' game, I suppose. Games like Apex, or Warzone, or even Fortnite.
And yet, for whatever reason, I don't consider them as candidates for the Bestest Best games of any year. I might pour hundreds, possibly thousands of hours into them and they won't even make it into my personal list of absolute faves. That's reserved for games, not games.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony released a sneak peek of its upcoming Gran Turismo movie yesterday evening during its CES 2023 press conference, and as expected, it features a lot of fast vehicles. 
Starring David Harbour (Stranger Things), Orlando Bloom (Pirates of the Caribbean, The Lord of the Rings), and David Barnet (Never Have I Ever), and directed by Neil Blomkamp (District 9, Elysium, Chappie), Gran Turismo is based on a true story. That story is about the GT Academy contest, which was a real contest held between 2008 and 2016 by Sony and Nissan. Winners were given entrance into Nissan's Driver Development Program, as noted by Video Games Chronicle. The film appears to be telling the tale of someone who won entrance into this program and then went on to become a real success in the racing world. 
Check out the Gran Turismo sneak peek for yourself below: 


As you can see, this sneak peek is a mix of what appears to be movie footage and behind-the-scenes footage, with stars like Harbour, Barnet, and Bloom talking about their excitement for the film. 
Gran Turismo hits theaters later this year on August 11. 
Alongside this sneak peek, Sony also revealed that Gran Turismo 7, the latest in the long-running series released last year, will be getting an update that makes the game playable on its upcoming PSVR2 platform. 
While waiting to learn more about this Gran Turismo movie, read about Project Leonardo, a new customizable accessibility controller kit PlayStation unveiled yesterday and then read about how the PlayStation 5 has surpassed 30 million units sold.

I had always observed the Fire Emblem series from a distance, worried its strategy gameplay wouldn’t be for me or stressed determining where best to start and how to play through the franchise’s various entries. Fire Emblem Three Houses was the first I gave a good try and 80-plus hours later, it’s one of my favorite games on Switch and turned me into a Fire Emblem fan. Since its reveal, I’ve looked at Fire Emblem Engage as a test bed: am I actually a Fire Emblem fan, or did I just really like Three Houses and its engaging Hogwarts-like school mechanics? If the 10 hours I’ve put into Engage so far are any indication, I’m happy to say it’s the former.

This news comes by way of the company's recent CES 2023 appearance, where PlayStation CEO Jim Ryan revealed these numbers alongside words that seem to indicate the PS5 shortage might be over, or at least coming to an end soon. PlayStation also touched on its upcoming PSVR2 release and accompanying 30-plus game lineup, and pulled back the curtains on its new customizable accessibility controller kit, Project Leonardo. 
As you can see, it seems Ryan and PlayStation are confident in the supply of PS5 consoles around the world. If you're still on the lookout for one, it seems now is the time to start searching retail stores again.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Last of Us turns 10 years old in June, and Naughty Dog plans to celebrate the milestone with an array of special announcements along the way. One of those updates involves a closer look at the upcoming standalone multiplayer title.
In a blog post, Naughty Dog co-president Neil Druckmann reflects on The Last of Us’ legacy as well as the franchise’s future. In addition to the HBO adaptation premiering on January 15 and the PC port of The Last of Us Part 1 hitting in March, Druckmann states fans will learn more about the long-awaited multiplayer experience that serves as a follow-up to the original game’s Factions mode. Druckmann writes,
“We’ll have some fun surprises for you along the way, but later this year we will begin to offer you some details on our ambitious The Last of Us multiplayer game. With a team led by Vinit Agarwal, Joe Pettinati, and Anthony Newman, the project is shaping up to be a fresh, new experience from our studio, but one rooted in Naughty Dog’s passion for delivering incredible stories, characters, and gameplay.”
Naughty Dog also shares a new piece of concept art, posted in full below, which is the first new material of the game since it released the first concept asset last June. It depicts two survivors heading toward a dilapidated cruise ship. 
Though we’ll be learning more about the game this year, it’s still unknown if Naughty Dog plans to launch it in 2023. That would be fitting given the anniversary, but we'll have to wait and see over the coming months. Until then, be sure to check out this feature on how The Last of Us Part 1 proves there's no such thing as a faithful remake.]]></summary>

And I did try to play some of them, for a bit. Elden Ring and Tunic were both too hard for my state of mind, which was as robust as pink candyfloss. Even Vampire Survivors wigged me out because it's so visually busy by the end game, and I was in a more "Ferrero Rocher and jigsaw of the London Underground map" sort of place. My downfall was seeing PowerWash Simulator on sale on Steam. I bought it, and then played it for 40 hours.

        <updated>2023-01-04T13:49:57.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wizards of the Coast, the company behind Dungeons & Dragons and Magic: The Gathering, has reportedly canceled five unannounced games alongside layoffs affecting "fewer than 15 people," according to a new Bloomberg report. 
The people that will lose their jobs will be given a chance to apply for new roles within WotC, but this apparent business restructuring will affect others outside of the company as well. Bloomberg reports that this reorganization will hit Otherside Entertainment and Hidden Path Entertainment, both working on games for WotC, hard. News of this change follows the release of Dungeons & Dragons: Dark Alliance's release last year, which didn't fare too well with critics and players, amidst Larian Studios' continued development on Baldur's Gate 3 (which does not seem to be affected by this reorganization despite WotC serving as the game's publisher). 
These two games, in part, represented WotC's bigger forray into the video game space as Bloomberg reports that the company had signed contracts with several studios to make games. WotC also "built at least six of its own game studios," according to the publication. 
One project in the works that is now canceled went under the codename "Jabberwocky," according to Bloomberg, and two more externally developed games early in development are no longer moving forward as well. These cancelations and layoffs comes as parent company Hasbro's shares fell 40% last year. 
Wotc told IGN that it remains "committed to using digital games as a cornerstone of our strategy for bringing our games to players around the world," adding that it has "made some changes to our long-term portfolio to focus on games which are strategically aligned with developing our existing brands and those which show promise in expanding or engaging our audience in new ways."

ZeniMax is the first studio in Microsoft's umbrella of teams to unionize and it's also now the largest group of unionized QA testers at any US-based studio.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Intel's Core i5 13400F processor was just announced, but thanks to a discount code at TechNextDay you can pick up this brand new CPU for just a shade over £200 compared to £228 on Amazon UK. That's a solid price for a 10-core CPU capable of boosting to 4.6GHz, with more cache and turbo power available to it than last year's 12400F. To get this reduced price, use code TND-10 at the checkout.

With season 2 of Invincible set to premiere on Amazon Prime sometime this year, Fall Guys is whetting fans’ appetite with skins for Mark, Omni-Man, and Atom Eve. The outfits hit the in-game store on January 5, and that hopefully means a release date announcement for the series won't be too far behind.

Fall Guys enjoyed a bit of a renaissance in 2022. In addition to its usual deluge of seasonal content updates, it went free-to-play in May and launched on Xbox and Switch, gaining a larger player base of contestants and renewed interest in general. We look forward to seeing what 2023 brings for the title, but this is a pretty good start.

        <updated>2023-01-03T17:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Polish developer The Astronauts have revealed a new trailer for their upcoming rogue-lite shooter Witchfire. In addition to showing off some new gameplay clips, it announces that the game will use NVIDIA DLSS3 technology, which a press release says will "massively boost performance." You can watch the trailer below.


Announced by NVIDIA last September, DLSS 3 can boost a game's performance by a significant margin. One demo on NVIDIA's site shows two instances of Cyberpunk 2077 running at 96 FPS with ray tracing still enabled. "DLSS 3 allows the seemingly impossible, high framerate without compromising the visuals," Adrian Chmielarz, creative director and co-founder of The Astronauts says in a press release. "A no brainer for a game like Witchfire, which is both action and beauty."
Witchfire is a dark fantasy first-person shooter from the creators of Painkiller, Bulletstorm, and The Vanishing of Ethan Carter. Set in an alternate reality, players are caught in the middle of a war between witches and the Church, and must use weapons and powers from Vatican sorcerers to defeat their enemies. 
The game is set to enter Early Access in the Epic Games Store sometime later this year, though that wasn't always the case. It was delayed last October because the team decided to overhaul the world's design and make it more open. This trailer is a good indication that the studio is still hard at work, though; here's hoping that "early 2023" ends up being as soon as possible.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[New year, new content: Cult of the Lamb is getting a "major content update" sometime in 2023. According to a Twitter thread posted to the official Cult of the Lamb account, this update will introduce features many players have requested, including accessibility improvements, quality-of-life features, new difficulty options, and more depth.
This Major Content Update will release in 2023 and be FREE to all players!
pic.twitter.com/FWFW7sC7F0
December 30, 2022
The biggest change they showcase in this thread is the introduction of heavy attacks, which can be activated by holding down the attack button. These are more than slow swings that do more damage; in Cult of the Lamb, every heavy attack has a unique effect. For example, the sword's heavy attack smashes the ground, doing an explosion of damage that harms any enemy caught in its range. Meanwhile, the dagger creates a line of knives that fall from the sky, and the axe can be thrown around like a boomerang. This is just the tip of the iceberg; developer Massive Monster says it's "just one small tidbit" of what's still to come.
The update should come soon, but not that soon. The last tweet of the thread clarifies that the developers are currently working on a patch to fix some console bugs and that the major update won't be released until after that. Their release window also isn't any more specific than "2023," so it could come out any time this year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[IO Interactive has announced that Hitman 3 will become Hitman World of Assassination later this month and will include all levels from Hitman 1 and Hitman 2 in it for free. 
More specifically, this big update for the Hitman trilogy arrives on January 26 and includes two major changes: 
"Hitman 3 will become 'Hitman World of Assassination,' which will also include access to Hitman 1 and Hitman 2 through our existing Access Pass system. Current Hitman 3 owners will get a free upgrade to Hitman World of Assassination on all platforms."
"We're drastically simplifying the purchase experience for new players. Hitman World of Assassination will be the single experience option to start playing." 


This update makes it so that all Hitman 3 owners will have the same base content ownership, and it attempts to eliminate confusion over which edition to buy to obtain certain levels by making it so that there is only one purchase option. The other DLC will apparently still be available for purchase, but owning all the IO Interactive Hitman trilogy levels will be easier than ever now. 
Hitman World of Assassination will cost $70, and it includes Hitman 3, the Hitman 1 Game of the Year Access Pass, and the Hitman 2 Standard Access Pass. You can also purchase the Hitman World of Assassination Deluxe Pack for $30 to get the Hitman 3 Deluxe Pack, the Hitman 3 Seven Deadly Sins Collection, and the Hitman 2 Expansion Access Pass. 
"Those are the only two products that new players need to consider when buying any Hitman game digitially as of January 26, 2023," IO writes in a blog post. "The changes have also been made with the Freelancer game mode in mind, where being able to easily access all locations from across the World of Assassination is parmount to maximizing your enjoyment." 
In the meantime, read Game Informer's Hitman 3 review and then read about the new Hitman 3 Freelancer mode.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The long-in-development remake of System Shock will finally be released this March. 
This news comes by way of a new Kickstarter update from developer Nightdive Studios, which states the team has picked "a few last things to share before our quickly approaching launch window of March 2023." as reported by Video Games Chronicle. This remake, which is set to hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC has had a 2023 release year attached to it for a minute now, but this new Kickstarter update points attention to the game's Steam page, which now features a "March 2023" release window.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Starbreeze Studios and publisher Koch Media have released a new teaser trailer that calls 2023 "the year of PayDay 3." Presumably, this means the co-op shooter is still on track to release sometime this year. 
Koch gave PayDay 3 a 2023 release window way back in March of 2021, detailing the game's new publishing deal alongside news that there is at least 18 months of post-launch support planned for the title. Later that year, in June, Koch released a new piece of concept art, citing that PayDay 3 will feature a "fully-fledged social heist universe" set within a Hollywood-like setting. That was the last we saw of PayDay 3 until yesterday, when IGN revealed the "official reveal trailer" for the game, although considering how little is shown in it, it's less of a reveal and more of a teaser. 
Check out this new PayDay 3 trailer below: 


As you can see, there's not much to this trailer other than it calling 2023 "the year of PayDay 3." Here's hoping that holds true. 
What do you hope PayDay 3 brings to the franchise? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Starfield, the new and upcoming sci-fi RPG from Skyrim makers Bethesda Softworks, was originally due out in November of 2022, but it was delayed to the first half of 2023 last May. Starfield was then a big part of an Xbox showcase last summer and during that showcase, Microsoft revealed that every game shown would be coming in the first half of 2023. 
Now, a new Bethesda support page for the game has reconfirmed this "first half of 2023" window, as spotted by Klobrille on Twitter.
"Starfield arrives exclusively on Xbox Series X/S and PC in the first half of 2023," the support page reads.
This isn't the biggest surprise; Xbox has discussed this release window for Starfield on two occasions before this support page, but it seems the company is really dedicated to getting it out in the coming months. 
While waiting for an official release date, read about why Bethesda's Starfield delay is key to its new-gen success and then check out this story about how your Starfield character will not have a voice. Read about how Starfield's ambitious scale might be worrisome after that and then read about how Xbox Series X/S first-party games will cost $70 starting this year. 
Do you think Starfield will get delayed again? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I made 12 little games (analog and digital) over the course of my MFA program. However, I dedicated most of that time to my thesis. By graduation, I’d worked as a writer/narrative designer on prototypes, vertical slices, documentation – you name it. And after many adjustments, my thesis even won a highly competitive grant to assist post-grad development! Short deadlines and secondary assignments led to high-stress periods, albeit in a controlled, academic environment, but the lessons about collaboration and creativity were invaluable.
It’s an ordinary school night, and I’m in a video call with my friend Jude. I watch them casually scroll through graffiti-adjacent concept art and brief clips of a passion project called Ponch: Cyberspace Investigator. They give me a rundown of the game’s mechanics, inspirations, and vibe, which includes phrases like “platformer,” “Ace Attorney-inspired dialogue puzzles,” “detective work,” and “hack the internet.” Read more...]]></summary>

DokeV feels like the “everything” video game, and it almost looks too good to be true. This delightfully colorful title is, among other things, part MMO, part open-world sandbox, part Pokemon, part Ghostbusters, and part llama-riding simulator.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[2022 is ready to drop from the calendar, revealing the unblemished pages of 2023 beneath. There's a small chance you're spending the next several hours at a bacchanalian rager, but I'd bet that you're not. You're more likely enjoying a few hours of peace and quiet after a week with family and wishing Jools would hurry the whole thing along.

That sounds like a perfect time to peruse your gaming library and wonder what you could play. Look at all those games you haven't got round to yet! Maybe 2023 should be the year you really commit to learning Dwarf Fortress, now the Steam version is out. Maybe this is the year you finally give an MMO a try or see your first JRPG to completion. Or maybe this year you're going to uninstall your backlog in its entirety and just accept you're only ever going to play Spelunky from now on.

What are your gaming ambitions for 2023? Tell us in the comments below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As both a parent and the resident news lad here, I probably spend way more time talking and writing about games than getting hundreds of hours to actually play them. While most of the games I've snuck the odd minutes with – I hesitate to say hours – made it onto our Advent Calendar for Horace’s approval, the three below were a few that made me and my family smile at different points throughout 2022. Roll on 2023 - and even more games.


Possibly my most magical Christmas as a kid was in 1997, aged 12. I got a Saturn and an issue of the UK’s Official Sega Saturn Magazine that had a Christmas NiGHTS Into Dreams disc on the cover. I reckon that it was my favourite, most unabashedly fun time for gaming ever (outside my decades fiddling around on PC, obvs). Indie platformer Lunistice is a blatant love letter to the 32-bit era, and the kind of game that largely skipped the poor old Saturn.


You guide Hana the Tanuki about as she dreams, aiming to get her to the Moon. Hana properly speeds along, bouncing and spinning her tail to thwack enemies with a lovely splat effect. Devs A Grumpy Fox have really nailed the classic 90s platformer vibe, thanks to all the different dreamworlds that Hana gets to careen through. Don’t expect something open-world like Sonic Frontiers, because Lunistice is deliberately meant to be a linear, short experience. Good grief, could we use more of those.

We're each powered by a spell that lasts but 12 months, so every Christmas we fall over like sad marionettes. The gnome has to spend a couple of weeks trekking up a mountain to see the fairy who can recast the spells on us. You can help fund his sled dogs and provisions by becoming a member of the RPS supporter program. While he's away, we've prepared some Christmas Crackers for you.

The first iteration of Dead Island 2 was helmed by Spec Ops: The Line developer Yager, as Dead Island developer Techland had parted ways with the property and worked on Dying Light.

It has been weird to not clock in and just Do News, and to have responsibility only over myself. This freedom has felt great when I've had ideas, and terrible when I've not. I'm still feeling it out, settling in, and making mistakes, but I'm quite enjoying myself. Hopefully you have enjoyed some of it too. Here are a few of my favourite things I've written this year!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Images of what appears to be a special The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom Switch OLED model have leaked online, but it's currently unclear if this is a real console or a believable fake. 
This news comes by way of Video Games Chronicle, which reports that the images of this console appeared on the Famiiboard forum last night from user Kysen. The user didn't provide many details about the potential special edition Switch, but as you can see in the images below, the photos are quite believable. There are pictures of the console, the packaging, the Joy-Con, and more.
Check out the possible leaked images of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom Switch OLED special edition for yourself below:

December 30, 2022
As you can see, it appears that this model of the Switch is real. However, elaborate and well-done fakes have been done before so there's no telling if this is actually real until we learn more information. It wouldn't be the most surprising thing ever, considering Nintendo tends to release special edition OLED models for big releases like this year's Splatoon 3 and Pokemon Scarlet and Violet. 
The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom hits Switch on May 12 so it might be a while before we learn if this special edition OLED model is real. In the meantime, check out our list of the biggest 2022 games delayed to 2023.

When every year has so many more than 24 good games, I always tried to tactically vote and reshuffle points to wedge in a few wee great games I knew not many people had played. But with a change to voting procedure this year, I simply couldn't get some games on our list. So, here are the games I would've slammed into our advent calendar if I were still allowed to cheat, along with some that simply didn't quite make the cut.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Metal Gear Solid creator and Death Stranding director Hideo Kojima and Metal Gear Solid publisher Konami parted ways with each other back in 2015 and since then, there hasn't been a mainline entry in the famed MGS series (although there was the not-so-great Metal Gear Survive in 2018). 
While there's no reason to believe Kojima and Konami are teaming up again anytime soon, it seems the latter might be preparing for some kind of return to MGS. Longtime MGS producer Noriaki Okamura wrote in a recent issue of Famitsu that "2023 will be a year of many announcements," as reported by Gematsu. 
In this special end-of-the-year issue of Famitsu, multiple Japanese developers and producers wrote quick teases about what 2023 might hold for them. It's here where Okamura teased that 2023 will be a year of announcements for Konami Digital Entertainment. More specifically, he said "Other than [the educational edition of Momotaro Dentetsu announced last year], 2023 will be a year of many announcements," and that his keyword for 2023 is "long-awaited," as noted by Gematsu. 
Now, this could just be his way of saying that Konami, as a whole, will make some announcements and that maybe some of them will be long-awaited by fans. However, given that it's Okamura – a longtime MGS producer – saying this, there's reason to believe that maybe he's teasing a return to the MGS series. Perhaps we're getting a remake of one of the games, or maybe a new mainline entry. Only time will tell. 
In the meantime, read Game Informer's ranking of the Metal Gear Solid series.

We're each powered by a spell that lasts but 12 months, so every Christmas we fall over like sad marionettes. The gnome has to spend a couple of weeks trekking up a mountain to see the fairy who can recast the spells on us.

It’s undeniably a bummer to see a title you’re excited about slip into the following year, but it’s generally for the best to ensure a quality product at release. 2022 has had a growing handful of high-profile setbacks, and we’ve assembled them all in one alphabetized list for a handy reference.

Arc Raiders was set to be the debut title from Embark Studios, a team of ex-DICE talent led by former EA head Patrick Söderlund. The co-op shooter about fighting off robots from space made a splash during last year's Game Awards. In a surprising twist, however, Embark announced months later it was delaying Arc Raiders to next year to focus on launching another shooter pro…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[AMD's Ryzen 5600X was a favourite of value-oriented gamers when it debuted in late 2020 - to say nothing of RPS head big honcho Katharine - so unsurprisingly AMD followed it up with an even cheaper model, the 5600, about a year later. This non-X variant performs more or less identically, with a slightly low rated boost clock that translates into one or two percent worse performance in CPU-limited scenarios. Given the fact that the 5600 is £13 cheaper on Amazon right now, we'd recommend it over the X any time.

This makes it a good performer even in sustained write scenarios, as you might encounter in video editing and the like, while its good random read/write speeds are good for gaming. Sabrent has discounted the drive to £77.99 on Amazon UK, which is a good price for this level of performance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl is still on track to release sometime next year, and developer GSC Game World has released its first trailer in six months, showcasing gameplay with some narrative trappings along the edges.
Courtesy of IGN, the new video shows that S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 is looking pretty darn good. The narrative-driven shooter is set in the Chornobyl Exclusion Zone in a post-apocalyptic world laden with dangerous mutated monsters. Players must fight their way to the heart of the zone while steering the non-linear plot through choice-driven gameplay. 


Formally confirmed in 2020 after years of start and stop announcements, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 has had a tumultuous development. After announcing and quickly canceling NFT plans due to fan backlash in December 2021, the project came to a screeching halt in February due to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, where GSC is based. Many employees were forced to evacuate their homes in Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital. Other designers chose to defend the city. One of GSC’s designers who volunteered to fight, Vladimir "Fresh" Yezhov, was recently killed in combat. 
S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl is slated to arrive on Xbox Series X/S (including Game Pass) and PC in 2023. It was one of the many titles to get bitten by the delay bug and pushed into next year, a list you can check out here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On February 25, 2022 Valve quietly premiered a trailer for a game called Aperture Desk Job. The video intentionally didn’t explain what the game was, but beyond including the word Aperture in the title, it was clear it took place in the Portal universe. The end of the trailer revealed it would be releasing only a few days later, and it would be free.


As promised, the game released on March 1 and it feels like nobody played it, which is a shame because it is a fantastic, “Playable Short,” as Valve refers to it.
Aperture Desk Job doesn’t have portals in it, but it is a Portal game. It features an established Portal character, as well as a new character named Grady, voiced by one of my favorite comedians (and maybe yours after you watch the clip below), Nate Bargatze.

The modder in question goes by the handle Arestame, who tweeted a trailer of their handiwork that drops Scarlet assets into the Lands Between. The mod outfits the Tarnished in the significantly less protective garb of Pokémon trainers, who cruise the dangerous landscape atop the motorcycle-like Koraidon. The video highlights how Elden Ring would be an even better game if it had Lechonks and Quaxlys roaming about, though that doesn't make it any less dangerous, as evidenced by one particuarly brutal Pokémon ambush. Check out the video by clicking the embedded tweet below.

I did, however, play a few hours with both Dani and Ryan, two very different survivors that add their own flair to the story of this zomb-pocalypse. 
I came out of this cover story trip convinced Dani is the survivor for me, but Ryan is great, too. And there are still the other four survivors I didn't get to play. Nonetheless, I want to tell you about Ryan, and Dambuster Studios does, too (read about Dani here)

Though every numbered entry received critical acclaim, Street Fighter V sticks out among fans as the outlier of the series; the game experienced perhaps the most tumultuous launch of any Street Fighter game to date. But out of that trouble emerged something great. Thanks to the team’s persistence, post-launch roadmap, and an injection of new blood into the project's leadership, Street Fighter V drastically improved its core gameplay, online play, content offerings, and more throughout its six-year lifespan.
With the benefit of those lessons learned, many team members that righted the ship are back to develop Street Fighter 6. The latest entry delivers myriad improvements, new features, and a sleek new aesthetic while simultaneously acknowledging and paying homage to each entry before it. Street Fighter 6 feels like yet another evolution of the fighting game genre ushered in by the franchise that pioneered it in the first place. Read more...]]></summary>

Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order is a notable inclusion because its sequel, Jedi: Survivor, is set to come out in March. This PS Plus offering is an ideal opportunity for players to check out the first before visiting the second. If you played the game at launch, this is also a chance to check out the updates that introduced upgraded graphics and performance for PS5, as well as updates that added New Journey+ and challenge modes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mortal Kombat was not supposed to die. Many regard Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe as one of the lowest points of the series. Its minigame-centric fights and awkward movement were damning, but it also lacked the silly, over-the-top violence Mortal Kombat is known for – a sad reality for appeasing license holder Warner Bros. Batman can cripple impoverished criminals, but he can’t be cut in half by Tarkatan blades.
It would have been disappointing to end on an ill-fated crossover, but Midway’s untimely demise could have made that so. Layoffs, uncertainty, and publisher implosion aren’t how franchises live; it’s how they die. But the then-newly formed NetherRealm Studios reinvigorated the entire franchise after its darkest period with one of its most beloved entries: the 2011 reboot, Mortal Kombat 9. Read more...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you walked into an arcade in the 1990s, it undoubtedly had a Street Fighter II cabinet. If you went at the right time, you probably even saw a crowd gathered around it. As one of the most profitable games in arcade history, Street Fighter II drew more than its fair share of quarters and tokens during the arcade heyday. But the franchise transcends that one moment in time. To say that Street Fighter has sparked multiple revolutions in its genre throughout its history is not far-fetched.
Arcades aren’t omnipresent the way they once were, but the Street Fighter name has endured the ever-shifting grounds of the games industry. The fierce fistfights made the leap from mall game rooms to the living room, the internet, and even tournaments broadcast to massive, international audiences. As the franchise turns 35 years old, we met with the people involved to understand the series’ origins and how it remains relevant three-and-a-half decades later. Read more...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Driller aka Space Station Oblivion (in the US), the FIRST supported game of the Freescape engine, is ready for public testing!
Published in 1987 by Incentive Software Limited, this revolutionary new engine allowed players to explore a solid 3D graphic environment with complete freedom of movement for the very first time in videogame history. 
A new threat emerges after humanity abandoned a dying Earth to establish a new home on planet Evath. Evath's moon Mitral has turned into a gigantic gas time bomb. A meteor is also due to impact Mitral in the next several hours. You were chosen to secure each of Mitral's 18 sectors by positioning a drilling rig over the gas pockets in each sector before the meteor strikes.
Solve challenging riddles by relying on geological clues, intuition, or good old trial and error. To survive your mission, find Rubicon crystals to restore energy and destroy (or avoid) the Laser Beacons and Skanners left behind by the Ketars. Good luck!
Our reimplemented engine features graphics using software (TinyGL) or hardware mode (OpenGL) at arbitrary resolution. The initial Driller support is limited to DOS (EGA mode), Amiga and AtariST releases, but we hope to be able to add more soon! Please contact us if you have some other release.
To play any of these supported releases, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker.
