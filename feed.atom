People don't seem interested in the 'project' and the price continues to drop.

Valve's Portal: Companion Collection will see the release of Portal and Portal 2 on a Nintendo system for the first time ever, but have you ever wondered what the original 2007 game might have looked like if it got a release during the N64 era?
Well, there's now a 'Portal 64' demake in the works. It's still in development, but in the video below you can see project contributor 'lambertjamesd' showcasing the portal gun and portals. What's even more impressive is that it's apparently running on real hardware and can go up to six portals deep.

As you may have seen across the web, May is mental health awareness month. While a lot of the stigma around the topic has eased, the issues and challenges remain across all parts of society. Throughout this month there are efforts to encourage support, understanding and knowledge around the topic.
There are various ways to help improve and maintain mental health, from basics such as regular exercise and a healthy diet to more complex treatment and support. Yet on a smaller scale other pleasures can help us deal with some tough times that life throws at us, whether it’s a favourite book, movie or, of course, a game. Part of the reason we play games is the joy they bring, offering escapism, emotional connection or just bright and colourful fun.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Which of these expensive monsters belongs on your credit card bill?
When Valve announced that it planned to make a handheld called the Steam Deck, it was immediately compared to the Nintendo Switch. You can understand that kneejerk reaction. They both let you play “proper games” on the go, they share a similar shape, and they would both have you muttering covetous obscenities if you saw someone pull one out on the train.
Realistically, though, this is an apples and oranges comparison. The Nintendo Switch OLED Model, the most expensive one, costs £310, and the system is essentially a slightly underpowered home console with legs. The Steam Deck costs £350-570 depending on the model, and is basically a gaming laptop chopped up and jammed into a plastic surfboard.

It's been a big week for video game football - with Electronic Arts and football's international governing body FIFA announcing they would be going separate ways. It seems that's not the only football drama currently taking place though.
Nintendo's upcoming release Mario Strikers: Battle League is looking great and all, but concerns have been raised about the character Daisy. If you've seen the roster reveal so far, you might have noticed the other Princess hasn't been featured in the promotional materials...at least yet, and well, it's got some of her fans freaking out on social media.

It's that time of year again when Atlus releases its annual survey - asking fans about their gaming habits as well as what games and series they would like to see more of in the future. This time around, there's also an English version of the survey open to residents in North America. You can still participate if you live outside this region.
This year's survey will open until 15th May (that's today) and contains a total of 49 questions. Once again, it wants to know what platforms it should release series like Persona, Etrian Odyssey and the Shin Megami Tensei series on - with the Nintendo Switch / Switch Lite as options. It then asks what platforms fans would like to play on, with the Switch once again being an option.

It's still cute, though. There's a reveal trailer below.

Several people then pointed out that sounded mildly dystopian.

Yesterday, Activison Blizzard responded, saying that the "prototype is not being used in active game development", and was designed as an optional supplement to other work.

        <updated>2022-05-14T14:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We've emerged from the depths of the BioShock series to begin a fresh season of Video Gameography! We're doing things differently this time as we're discussing the gameography of a developer rather than covering an individual game series. That studio is Supergiant Games, the acclaimed indie developer of Bastion, Transistor, Pyre, and Hades. This week, we continue our season by analyzing 2017's Pyre. 
Pyre was released on June 25, 2017. After Supergiant struggled to create Transistor, the team adopted a looser "anything goes" approach for Pyre. The game blends together disparate elements reflecting the team's interests such as a high-fantasy setting, a large cast of engaging characters, a ritual in the form of a basketball/soccer-like competition, and Oregon Trail-inspired exploration. Tune in to find out how Supergiant concocted the game's centerpiece "sports" game, its approach to crafting a larger branching narrative (including an ever-changing end credit song), and which members of the Nightwings we chose to liberate and the ones we abandoned in the Downside.
Join hosts Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), John Carson (@John_Carson), along with video game consultant and former Game Informer editor Suriel Vazquez (@SurielVazquez) for a verbal stroll through the history and narrative of Pyre!
If you'd like to get in touch with the Video Gameography podcast, you can email us at podcast@gameinformer.com. You can also join our official Game Informer Discord server by linking your Discord account to your Twitch account and subscribing to the Game Informer Twitch channel. From there, find the Video Gameography channel under "Community Spaces."]]></summary>

Metal Max fans in the west are not what you’d call spoiled for choice, especially in regards to English-language releases. It would be more accurate to say that series fans are “Metal Max-starved.” In the span of the series’ 31-year existence, only two games have been released in English —2006’s Metal Saga (thusly named due to trademark issues at the time) and 2018’s Metal Max Xeno. For English-speaking fans, it’s Metal Max Xeno that’s relevant here, as Metal Max Xeno: Reborn is, as the title suggests, a reimagining of that game.
Originally released on PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita and PC, Metal Max Xeno was unlike the traditional turn-based RPGs that comprise the majority of the Metal Max franchise. Xeno was, instead, a free-roaming action game with hybrid RPG elements. Free to roam and explore largely barren environments, travel was frequently interrupted by randomly-spawning enemies ranging from an assortment of insectoid creatures, tanks, mechs, and the occasional ‘wanted’ boss enemy.

Well, it's certainly been a bit of a busier week for us here at Nintendo Life! Looking at game announcements, we're going to be getting Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards on the Switch Online Expansion Pass, plus Alan Wake has been confirmed for release on the Switch later this year. Finally, of course, we had a brand new Indie World showcase, bursting at the seams with lots of cool little eShop gems.
In other news, our very own NL community member Zuljaras created a remarkable DOOM sculpture, we took a look at the emergent narrative within Minecraft, and there's been a bizarre bit of drama surrounding the Fei Long character in Street Fighter! Last, but certainly not least of course, we saw the release of Nintendo's financial results for FY2022, begging the question as to when we might actually see the arrival of the Switch 2.

The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild 2 will no longer be released this year on the Nintendo Switch, and it's left Zelda fans with nothing to really look forward to in 2022. One rumour is Wind Waker and Twilight Princess will fill this space.
Interestingly though, if they are getting released on the Switch, Tantalus - the team that originally worked with Nintendo on Twilight Princess HD for the Wii U - supposedly hasn't been asked. On a new episode of the Fragments of Silicon Podcast, Tantalus CEO Tom Crago was asked if Nintendo had reached out to the Australian-based developer about Twilight Princess HD for Switch.

Today, musicians from across Europe and beyond come together to give it their all, with varying degrees of catchiness, camp, and drama. Honestly, this year's contest better be amazing, considering some great songs have already been knocked out before the finals. I was particularly surprised by the loss of Austria's pop goths and Latvia's song with the most surprising obscene opening line in pop history. If that's the quality of song being rejected, they BETTER NOT have any boring junk in the finals. But we have hours to fill until Eurovision starts, so what are you playing this weekend?

Nintendo's purple mischief-maker Waluigi created some saucy scenes last May when a new render of him holding a rose surfaced online. This same render was first shared during an episode of Nintendo Minute, and it seems it actually caused some drama in the office before the video was even released.

One series we're sure many Nintendo fans would love to see make a return is the F-Zero. Although the Nintendo 64 version got a re-release in March via the Switch Online service, there hasn't been a new entry in the futuristic racing series since the 2004 Game Boy Advance title, F-Zero Climax.
So, will this classic Nintendo series ever make a return? Former Nintendo of America president Reggie Fils-Aimé (who is currently busy promoting his new book Disrupting the Game) was asked by GamesBeat why F-Zero was "abandoned" by Nintendo?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To unlock every character in Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga, you'll need to play through all nine movies and perform specific tasks, but you can get a few by simply entering a code. TT Games and Warner Bros. Interactive provided Game Informer with several codes at launch. When you boot up the game, enter the pause screen, then access the option "Enter Code."
The codes will add a variety of characters like Dengar and Emperor Palpatine. Getting these characters early is a big win, as they are a part of classes you'll need to perform certain feats and don't normally unlock until later in the game. Here are the codes:
Aayla Secura: KH7P320
Admiral Holdo: XV4WND9
C-3PO (Holiday): C3PHOHO
Chewbacca (Holiday): WOOKIEE
DARTH VADER (Holiday): WROSHYR
Dengar: OKV7TLR
D-O (Holiday): TIPYIPS
Emperor Palpatine: SIDIOUS
Gonk Droid (Holiday): LIFEDAY
Grand Moff Tarkin: 3FCPPVX
Mister Bones: BAC1CKP
Nute Gunray: WBFE4GO
Poe Dameron (Holiday): KORDOKU
Poggle The Lesser: Z55T8CQ
Ratts Tyerell: GR2VBXF
Razor Crest (Ship): ARVALA7
Resistance I-TS Transport (Ship): SHUTTLE
Shaak Ti: VT1LFNH
Shmi Skywalker: T9LM1QF
Snap Wexley: SKYSAGA
We'll update this list as more character codes are discovered. Until then, have fun unlocking characters on your own, and may the Force be with you!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I was a kid, I had a Luke Skywalker action figure with a lightsaber that slid out of his wrist. It was one of my prized possessions, even though the details were lacking. This version of Luke looked more like an elf from the Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer claymation film than actor Mark Hamill. His lightsaber was also oddly yellow instead of blue – a detail I always thought was odd.
The point being, action figures have come a LONG way since then. Hot Toys' latest Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness action figure looks so realistic it could be in a wax museum. Benedict Cumberbatch's facial detailing is spot on, and the 30 points of articulation allow for many of his spell-casting poses to be recreated. To make sure these spell motions look just like in the movie, Hot Toys includes over a dozen interchangeable hands with fingers pointing every which way. You'll also find five mystic powers to go along with some of the hands to truly sell the effects of the spell.  
The figure is 31 centimeters in height and comes with a variety of accessories, like the Book of Vishanti, two sling rings, an amulet, handcuffs, mystic vipers, and so much more.
Hot Toys hasn't given us a price yet, but it's expected to ship in either the third or fourth quarter of 2023. You can find out more about this amazing figure at Hot Toys' official site. Check out images of this figure in action below:]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stop me if you've heard this before, but the Halo series has continuously been a roller coaster ride of good and bad, and few episodes encapsulate that as well as this week's tale in "Allegiance." Join us on The Game Informer Show as we discuss the eighth episode of the series, break down the most significant moments, and discuss the scene everyone is talking about.


Your regular hosts of Alex Stadnik, Andrew Reiner, and Brian Shea are back again and definitely have thoughts on the return of Master Chief, Makee, and Dr. Halsey. After a week away on Madrigal with Kwan and Soren, the focus shifts back to Reach and what the UNSC is doing about finding The Covenant and Halo. While the militaristic arm of humanity panics over other planets getting glassed by their alien foes, John and Makee are spending time getting to know each other after their shared vision of the show's namesake.
While the universe's greatest Spartan and the Covenant spy fraternize in the park (and other places), Dr. Halsey continues to meddle in order to advance humanity in her image, threatening the people she's trying to save in the process. Will the good doctor's interference and the union between the main characters result in unity between the two warring factions or make the upcoming battle that much harder? You'll just have to listen to this week's show to find out.
What do you think about Halo thus far? Be sure to let us know in the comments below. We'd also love your feedback on the extra GI Show episodes. Do you like them? Do you want to see us focus on games or the Marvel shows in the future? Please email us at podcast@gameinformer.com or reach out on Discord as we want to know what you think.]]></summary>

It's impossible to create an exhaustive list of every term that falls in and out of common usage around the gaming landscape, but there are some words that we repeatedly see misunderstood or questioned.
Here are some of those most commonly used and misunderstood terms, and a shortform definition of what they mean and how they're most commonly discussed. In addition, we've paired up several words that are often used either in conjunction with one another, or are commonly misused in context.

We know a fair amount about Xenoblade Chronicles 3 already — we've met some of the characters and poured over many of the game's combat in the upcoming RPG. Today, Nintendo has introduced us to two of the game's areas — and one's got a particularly familiar foe for Xenoblade fans to challenge.
These two new areas tick a couple of JRPG boxes and a couple of Xenoblade boxes, but what always makes these locations stand out is the variety of fauna, flora, and the sheer scope and detail of each place. Don't forget, we might have seen snippets of these places before, but this is the first time either location has been named — so get a little refresher from a few weeks ago first:

        <updated>2022-05-13T17:46:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl is getting three new characters over the next several months. Today, players can download X-J9 AKA Jenny from My Life as a Teenage Robot. Hugh Neutron, the duck-loving meme king and father of Jimmy Neutron, arrives this summer. Lastly, Rocko of Rocko’s Modern Life fame is slated for the fall. 
The announcement trailer below largely focuses on Jenny, who can pummel opponents with rocket-powered fists, zap them with lasers, slice them up with buzzsaws, and utilize other gadgets. Unfortunately, we don’t get any gameplay footage of Hugh or Rocko, but those videos will likely arrive as we approach each character’s launch dates.
Each fighter is labeled as premium DLC, meaning they come at a price. You can grab Jenny, her Tremorton Joyride stage, and her alternate costume for $4.99. A Universe Pack containing all three characters, along with the new stages and costumes tied to them, goes for $11.99. 


Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl didn’t blow us away (here’s our review), but it's a respectable platform fighter and it’s cool to see developer Ludosity continue to bolster the roster with fan-favorite characters. One has to wonder if these will be the only new faces to grace the game in 2022 given how spaced out they are, and what characters will be added in 2023, if any. 
Are you still playing Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl? What do you think of these new additions? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

Roundguard has been out on Switch for a couple of years, but now it's getting a lick of paint with the Encore 2.0 Update, which will add a ton of new content to the game. Here's a list of the new features:

New physical game stores don't come around very often, okay, so we're pretty excited about this. We got an invite to attend the grand opening of Limited Run Games' new store, which is bursting with physical games of both the new and retro variety — and not just games the publisher and distributor.
Situated inside the MacGregory Village shopping center in the town of Cary in North Carolina, the store opened its doors on 30th April and is open every Friday 12pm – 9pm EDT, Saturday 10am – 9pm EDT, and Sunday 11am – 6pm EDT.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[AMD’s FSR 2.0 upscaler is out now – in only one game, Deathloop, but still. This is a big moment for the heavily upgraded FSR (FidelityFX Super Resolution), as it’s basically attempting to fight Nvidia’s rival DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling) with some of its own tactics. There’s none of Nvidia’s machine learning enhancements, but whereas FSR 1.0 was a simple spatial upscaler – meaning data used for upscaling a frame could only come from within the frame itself – FSR 2.0 uses a temporal upscaling technique similar to that of DLSS. This allows it to draw data from previous frames as well, producing a sharper, higher-quality image. 


The lack of machine learning also has the upside of keeping FSR 2.0, like FSR 1.0, compatible with any reasonably recent gaming GPU. Nvidia may make most of this generation’s best graphics cards, but you won't need something brand new and super powerful to let FSR 2.0 boost your frame rates. To find out how well it works, compared to both DLSS and FSR 1.0, I reinstalled Deathloop and gave all three upscalers a whirl.

Despite appearances, it's quite mildly roguelike, and those of you who dig a complex strategic challenge or skin of your teeth type survival story aren't quite the right audience. This one is a more forgiving affair, and yet not easy or simply enough that I ever got bored. It's a good time.

Developer Bohemia Interactive announced a livestream on that day focused on the future of the series.  Bohemia’s press release teases next to nothing of what to expect, only saying the presentation will feature an "exciting reveal." Will it be Arma 4? You can find out by catching the stream on the Arma Twitch channel, which begins at 10 a.m. Pacific/1 p.m. Eastern.  
The last mainline entry was 2013’s Arma 3, a game Bohemia has consistently supported with numerous content updates over the past nine years. Its most recent expansion, Arma 3: Creator DLC: SOG - Prairie Fire, launched in 2021. The tactical shooter franchise has maintained a popular following, and its active mod scene helped spawn popular multiplayer offshoots such as DayZ and PUBG: Battlegrounds. 
What do you expect to see in the livestream? Do you think Arma 4 will be announced, or will it be another big Arma 3 expansion? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

Pétursson is hardly the first person to profess an affection for Paul Verhoeven’s cult military satire. But he is one of the few with command of his own company of science fiction game developers. For well over half of Eve Online’s existence, he has led CCP in an effort to create the perfect spin-off shooter - stubbornly chasing the dream of a playable Starship Troopers, even as those brave young prototypes have been cut down by unimpressed players, one after the other.

This news comes by way of The NPD Group’s Mat Piscatella, who reports monthly U.S. sales numbers of video game hardware, software, accessories, and more. This month’s news includes an overall decline in consumer video game spending, down 8%, to $4.3 billion, compared to April of last year. Year-to-date 2022 spending is also 8% lower than the same period one year ago, down to $18.3 billion. However, it was still a great month for video game hardware – especially the Switch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Party games can provide some of the best experiences in all of gaming. They force players to group up and work together toward a common goal, which can be very rewarding. Not all of them do that, though – some party games will test the bonds of friends greatly, be it on a Mario Party battlefield, an Overcooked kitchen, or somewhere else entirely. Regardless of the objective, playing games with friends is always fun and when developers specifically hone in on that camaraderie, the result can be a great game that makes an appearance at any and every social gathering. 
This list highlights some of our personal faves. Here are 10 great party games, listed in no particular order, that are sure to bring cheers, laughs, screams, and more to any event.

        <updated>2022-05-13T13:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Pokémon Trading Card Game is back with its second expansion of 2022, and this time, despite the Sword & Shield nomenclature on the box, I was most excited for the Pokémon that appeared in games like Pokémon Legends: Arceus. This expansion adds more than 180 new cards, including 3 new Radiant Pokémon, 8 Pokémon VStar, 21 Pokémon V, and 2 Pokémon VMax cards. On top of that, Astral Radiance delivers 30 cards with special art in the Trainer Gallery subset, as well as more than 20 Trainer cards.
The Pokémon Company sent us a ton of booster packs so we could see what we pull from this newest addition to the TCG. I was pleasantly surprised not only with the Radiant Pokémon I pulled but also by the number of Hisuian Pokémon that appeared in Pokémon Legends: Arceus. I loved the Decidueye and Typhlosion cards I secured through these booster packs, as well as the various rideable and Noble Pokémon I recognized from my time in Hisui. If you are hoping to round out your personal collection with more Galar Pokémon, don't worry, as I still found several creatures from Gen VIII's main region.
However, my favorite card is probably one that features a Pokémon I did not anticipate being so excited about: Hoothoot. This serene full-art Battle Region card immediately caught my eye and became the showpiece addition to my collection from this expansion. You can see the full gallery of my favorite cards I pulled from booster packs of the Astral Radiance expansion below:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The NFL’s Los Angeles Chargers has revealed its upcoming 2022 season football schedule in the best way possible and it’s a must-watch. 
Releasing a football schedule might sound boring on paper, and perhaps if you’re not the Chargers it is, but the Los Angeles-based team decided to do something we think every NFL team should do: release its football schedule as an anime opening, complete with a great track and some well-done animation that harkens back to anime favorites like One Piece, Attack On Titan, and much more. Check it out for yourself below!
Should we REALLY make our schedule release video an anime?

May 13, 2022
As you can see, the video begins with a nice logo treatment before revealing that the Chargers will face the Las Vegas Raiders in both teams’ first game of the 2022 season. And if you’re at all familiar with One Piece, you can see how the Chargers turned the Raiders into the One Piece team. 

The rest of the video contains a bunch of other great anime references so be sure to check it out and let us know which one is your favorite below! After that, read Game Informer’s Madden NFL 22 review.]]></summary>

        <updated>2022-05-13T12:30:24.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you’ve played Elden Ring, then you’re familiar with the strange occurrence that happens when you reach the main menu of the game and you’re somehow forced to sit on the screen for at least 30 seconds while listening to what can only be described as an extremely hype start to the day’s Elden Ring session (or is that just me?). 
It’s a great song – orchestral, epic, and an awesome way to begin the game each time you boot it up. However, what if it was composed in a different style, perhaps as a symphonic metal song? Or maybe a lofi hip-hop track? Well, composer Alex Moukala has done just that and more. In fact, Moukala covered the main theme of Elden Ring in 15 different styles: Spanish Guitar, Nu-Disco, Symphonic Metal, Smooth Jazz, Lofi Hip-Hop, Darksynth, Movie Trailer, Piano Solo, Baroque (my personal favorite), Reggae, Big Room House, French House, Trap x Traditional Japanese (also possibly my favorite), and Orchestral. 


As you can see in the video above, there’s not a single style Moukala remixes Elden Ring’s theme into that doesn’t work – if I booted up From Software’s latest, which is great but even better when playing with friends, and any of these started playing, I’d be just as excited as I am when I hear the standard theme. If you like these remixes, you’re in luck because Moukala does this all the time. He has other “X Game In 15 Different Styles” videos, video game trailer music rewrites and re-arrangements, music analyses, and so much more. His entire channel is great!
For more Elden Ring, read Game Informer’s Elden Ring review to find out why we gave it a 10 out of 10 and then read about why one Game Informer editor believes From Software’s next game should prioritize co-op. Check out this story about how someone used a modded Fisher-Price baby controller to play Elden Ring on PC after that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Lego games I'm most familiar with are the licensed property games - yer Lego Indiana Joneses and yer Lego Star Warses where you run around a continuous level smashing things. Lego Bricktales is more akin to last year's extremely cute geometric puzzler Lego Builder's Journey, in that you're exploring detailed, colourful brick dioramas, and solving puzzles by bulding things out of titular hot-property block. In Bricktales, though, it's way more granular. You're whisked away into a separate building screen to construct and stress test things like bridges and beams to support a platform, for example. You have a set number of different shaped and sized bricks to work with.
From playing a preview build of the first level - a jungle, home to some lost explorers - the thing that impresses me most about Bricktales is just how much it's like building things with actual Lego. It sounds stupid to say, but them little bricks are really astonishingly realised. It all looks so much Lego it's sort of surprising that you can't reach through the screen and pick it up. It's amazing. It's the closest thing to Lego you can get outside of actual Lego - which is the problem. It just kind of makes you miss Lego.

As always, the expansion also releasing alongside a new free patch with balance fixes and bux fixes for all.

        <updated>2022-05-12T21:11:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[MultiVersus, the upcoming platform fighting game bringing together the WB brands under one brawl-for-all, has finally had its first official look at gameplay with a Pros vs. Devs exhibition. In the 18-minute video, two professional fighting game players, NAKAT and VoiD, square off against developers from Player First Games, director Tony Huynh and principal developer Daniel Kraft, in a 2v2 competition.
Feast your eyes on the video above to see what actual matches of MultiVersus look like in the format the game was built around: two-on-two team battles. KATAT and VoiD are top competitors in MultiVersus' very early testing, coming in the top spot of a closed alpha team tournament, so the action on-hand is fast-pasted. Only four characters are shown in the video – Tom and Jerry, Superman, Shaggy, and Wonder Woman – but there's plenty to learn about how each character plays if you look closely. We also get a look at the U.I. used in fights, with the numbers representing damage taken on each player always showing directly below that character's model. It took me a little bit to get used to the change over the classic Smash Bros. U.I., but I get how this can be more readable at a glance.
Along with this first look at MultiVersus gameplay, Warner Bros. Games and Player First Games have announced a 32-team tournament that's set to take place at Evo in August. The prize pool for the event is set at $100,000, laying down the challenge for potentially big payouts for those who place high in the competition. 
MultiVersus has had a few smaller closed alpha tests but will be moving into another testing phase starting on May 19. If you're interested in a chance to throw hands with the iconic slate of Warner Bros. characters, you can sign up for a chance to play in the 9-day event on the game's website. MultiVersus does not have a release date yet but targets PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC as a free-to-play product with cross-play and cross-progression.]]></summary>

EA Motive seem to be taking advantage of that by releasing lots of behind-the-scenes, in-development videos and streams of their work on the Dead Space remake. Then, occasionally in those streams, they offer some news. Back in March, they let it be known during a deep dive into the remake's audio that the game would release in early 2023. Now, during a livestream about the game's art, they've announced the specific release date: January 27th, 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, Bethesda announced that it was delaying both Arkane Austin’s Redfall and Bethesda Game Studios’ highly-anticipated Starfield. As for why, Bethesda kept it simple: both teams need more time to make the games the best they can be. And while my initial reaction was sadness – like many, I was very excited to check out both this year – I feel a bit of relief.
No, I’m not going to mention that Shigeru Miyamoto quote here, as I’m sure you’ve heard it plenty of times (it’s true, though!), but I will say that this delay means a lot for Bethesda. In fact, I think Bethesda’s Starfield delay is key to its new-gen success. 


Let’s head back to 2011. Bethesda Game Studios released Skyrim, easily its most popular game and arguably its best RPG, on November 11, 2011. It got a 9.5 out of 10 from us…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Motive and EA have revealed that the upcoming Dead Space Remake will be released at the start of next year.
More specifically, the from-the-ground-up remake of the 2008 sci-fi survival horror classic will be released on January 27, 2023. Some of the Motive team revealed this in a new livestream that aired today. Back in March, the team showcased some new gameplay in a livestream focused on the remake’s audio development and today’s stream was all about the visuals of Dead Space. Right at the end of this stream, the team shared the official January release date alongside new gameplay. 
You can check out the gameplay segment in the livestream below at the 1:18:23 mark: 


Here are some screenshots we captured from the stream if you can't yet watch the video: 

According to Motive, this gameplay is technically pre-alpha but the team said the game’s visual and environmental team worked hard to elevate this to a state they’d consider greater than pre-alpha. In fact, Motive said this is closer to the level of quality that the studio says players should expect for the entire game. 
“[It’s] not ready to ship, but it’s getting closer,” one of them remarked during the segment before another revealed the team recently completed its first full walkthrough of the remake. 
As for when we’ll see Dead Space again, Motive said it anticipates doing a gameplay-focused reveal or livestream in October, closer to Halloween. That’s perfect timing because it’s just a few months before its January 27, 2023 release date. While waiting for this gameplay reveal, be sure to check out the gameplay look shown back in March.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Remedy Entertainment has released an Alan Wake Anniversary video in honor of 12 years of Alan Wake, and in it, the studio showcases some new Alan Wake 2 concept art and more. 
More specifically, Remedy’s new update includes four new pieces of Alan Wake 2 concept art and news that Alan Wake Remastered is coming to Switch this fall. There's also an update on the Alan Wake TV show first announced in 2018 (we can’t believe it’s still happening, either). As far as the new concept art goes, it’s exactly what you’d expect: moody, dark, and subtle in terms of what it reveals about Alan Wake 2. The art looks great, though! You can check it out in the slideshow below:
Moving on to what the team has to say about Alan Wake 2, here’s what Remedy's creative director Sam Lake shared:
You can check out the development update for yourself below: 


Elsewhere in the video, Remedy reveals that Alan Wake Remastered, which hit PlayStation and Xbox consoles, and PC last year, is coming to Switch this fall. It will be a digital-only release on Switch, and it runs natively on the console – it’s not a cloud version like Remedy’s Control is on the platform. 
Remedy also revealed that its Alan Wake TV adaptation, which was announced four years ago, is still a real thing and very much happening. In fact, the studio has found a home for the series: AMC. You likely know of AMC as the home of The Walking Dead, Breaking Bad, and Better Call Saul, and now, AMC Networks has purchased the rights to this Alan Wake adaptation. Remedy says there’s still a lot to go for the series to become a reality, though, so don’t expect to watch an episode of it anytime soon. 
While waiting to learn more about Remedy’s Alan Wake series, read Game Informer’s Alan Wake Remastered review and then check out the reveal of Alan Wake 2.

        <updated>2022-05-12T16:25:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While 2022 started strong with a string of spectacular releases, the warmer months have begun to cool, with most AAA experiences waiting until fall or 2023 to finally release. Don't despair, as this is the perfect time to brush up on your backlog and catch up before some of the industry's biggest sequels come to your favorite home console. In that spirit, we're headed back to 2018's God of War on this edition of GI Live to get reacquainted with Kratos and Atreus ahead of Ragnarok's 2022 release date (fingers crossed).
Watch on Twitch!
Join your hosts, Marcus Stewart and Alex Stadnik, as they return to the Norse world of gods and monsters live on Twitch at 2 p.m. CT. We'll be playing the first two hours of the game, letting you know why it's one of our favorites of the last few years, and discussing where we think the next game is going (spoilers: Norse mythology is wild).
If you need a reminder of God of War's greatness, be sure to check out our review, where we said:
Years ago, Kratos killed the deities of Mount Olympus in a gory rampage. Now, in the Norse realm, he has remade himself into a different kind of god. He is quieter and more deliberate, affected by his history but not constrained by it. Kratos' reinvention serves as a narrative hook, but it also parallels the series' evolution as a whole; where God of War once relied on bombast and bloodlust, now it leaves space for strategy and nuance. It still has superb action and plenty of jaw-dropping moments, but it supports them with a new level of depth and maturity. God of War learns from its past while clearing an exciting path for the future, and emerges as one of the best games of this generation.

        <updated>2022-05-12T16:18:49.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Netflix released the first official teaser for its upcoming Resident Evil series, which hits the subscription service on July 14, and in it, Umbrella is hiding something. Fortunately, we know exactly what it is: there’s a hidden Easter egg that leads to a second, more gruesome zombie-filled trailer within the initial one. 
The first teaser, released publicly by Netflix, is pretty by-the-books. It tees up the show’s premise and showcases the main protagonists beginning a new life in New Raccoon City in 2022. Then it quickly transitions to 2036, at which point, much of the world seems overrun with zombies. There are a few of the video game’s most famous zombies to be found in the first teaser, but the second teaser is sure to give fans more of what they’re looking for: terror, zombie dogs, lickers, and more. 
Check out the first teaser below, and then we’ll show you how to get to the second teaser: 


You might have caught it yourself, but just in case you didn’t, at the 24-second mark in the first teaser, a URL appears on-screen: umbrellaisjoy.com.
If you head there, it takes you to a mock-up of what an Umbrella pharmaceutical website might look like. However, after a few seconds, it transitions into a Netflix Resident Evil site, at which point you should see the second teaser embedded. 
This second teaser, in our opinion, is significantly better than the first, at least in terms of bringing the scares and horror we want out of anything related to Resident Evil. Check it out for yourself below:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You could fairly think of the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 Ti as a big, stump-necked brute of a graphics card. What better characterisation for the latest tippity-top-of-the-line GPU from Nvidia, who’ve already produced the best graphics card for 4K in the RTX 3080? But rather than be overwhelmed by its power, I personally feel more like the RTX 3090 Ti is trying to trick, tempt and seduce me, Old Testament-style. “Recommend meeeee” it whispers, coasting through another maximum settings benchmark. “Tell evvvvvvveryone these frame rates are totally worth £1879.”


But I can’t. Sorry. While I am a sucker for go-faster gear, the RTX 3090 Ti is just too far of a stretch, with its sometimes imperceptible performance differences to the £1399 RTX 3090 and a tendency towards impractically gigantic partner card models.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Codemasters Cheshire has been absorbed by Criterion Games to develop new Need For Speed games. 
EA announced in March of 2021 that it was delaying its next Need For Speed game out of 2021 and into 2022 so that Criterion could instead focus on development of Battlefield 2042 alongside DICE. Then, earlier this week, EA confirmed in its financial results that it was expecting to release a new Need For Speed this year while also revealing that it has four unknown games set to release between January 2023 and March 2023. Now, we have an update regarding the future of the franchise. 
We can confirm Criterion Games and the development team at Codemasters Cheshire are officially coming together to create the future of @NeedforSpeed, forming one Criterion studio with two location hubs. [1/3]
May 12, 2022
Now, as you can see in the tweets above, Codemasters goes just short of saying it and Criterion are working on the Need For Speed expected to release this year. It wouldn’t be surprising if this new studio team-up were doing just that, but as it stands in these tweets, it seems the merged studio is looking ahead to the future of the Need For Speed franchise. 
Personally, I hope that future includes a return to the Underground series or maybe even just a remaster of the first Underground – whatever it takes to listen to Lil Jon’s "Get Low" again while driving around a neon-lit, nighttime city, to be honest.

Inspired by Optimus Prime's G1 cartoon roots, this set consists of 1,508 pieces and retails for $169.99. The level of detail in Optimus' robot form is spot on, but more impressive yet, the 19 points of articulation allow for this build to transform into vehicle form, without having to disassemble it.

Optimus' chest can open up to store the Matrix of Leadership. He also comes equipped with accessories that you build, like his blaster, an energon cube, and an energy axe that you can swap with his hand. The set will be on store shelves on June 1. No word was given if this will just be a one-off with the Transformers license, or if more robots in disguise will be on the way.

Please don't let this put you off, though, because we do talk about some bloody well good games.
The times being what they are, though, results in us having a long discussion of patter theft, because some dreadful American (we assume) stole the "It's me, Blorko!" tweet and then just did a much worse version of it. Hang your head in shame, whoever you are. I also went to a first communion party and ate a lot of cake, and had a run in with a very charismatic toddler who may or may not be evil.

Konami is not the company it used to be, depending on who you ask. It's always had a hand in pachinko machines and mobile releases. It also had a heavy hand in standard video game releases with franchises such as Metal Gear Solid, Castlevania, etc. Konami isn’t too concerned with the latter these days. However, it is releasing the highly-anticipated TMNT: The Cowabunga Collection this year, and its focus has continued to shift into pachinko and mobile releases. That move has paid off because mobile games like Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel, which is also available on consoles and PC, have helped Konami establish one of its most successful years of all time, as reported by Eurogamer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bethesda has delayed Starfield and Redfall to the first half of 2023. 
This news comes by way of an update posted today by the official Bethesda Twitter account which explains that both teams behind Starfield and Redfall, which are Bethesda Game Studios and Arkane Austin respectively, need more time to ensure the games are the best they can be.

May 12, 2022
Redfall was announced just last year with a planned release for sometime in the summer of this year while Starfield, which was revealed nearly four years ago, was expected to release on November 11, 2022. Now, players will have to wait roughly a year to play both.
Both will launch on Xbox Game Pass now that Bethesda is owned by Microsoft. It's unclear when we'll get our first deep-dive looks at both of these games but considering Bethesda said "soon" in its update today, there's a good chance they'll show up at the Xbox and Bethesda Games Showcase happening on June 12.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Leave the doormat outside long enough in Age Of Darkness: Final Stand and you might not live to see the morning. If the game’s grimdark aesthetic didn’t warn you, here’s another from me directly: this game is brutal. Be mentally prepared to start over, over and over again. The “one more round” syndrome is strong with this mashup of tower defense and strategy.


The game’s premise is simple: survive. While the standard survival mode is challenging enough to warrant hours of gameplay, Age Of Darkness’s modifiers let you amp up the carnage for a nightmarish good time. See those little creatures all over your screen like bees in an unstable hive? Now picture building a settlement over them.

The book isn't due to be published until early next year, but does this mean the Doom movie from 2005 starring Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson is technically Romero’s biopic? Did The Rock not want to wear a wig? I’m very confused.

While this is arguably a poor use of my time, I enjoy the process—and technically it is productive.

Rogue Legacy 2 doesn’t make the biggest initial splash. In fact, at first glance, you’d be hard-pressed to see what’s changed from 2013’s Rogue Legacy to Cellar Door Games’ sequel. Despite switching from 2D sprites to a 3D rendered world, it veers close to the previous game’s aesthetic. While this lack of deviation from the original’s template proves to be a theme throughout Rogue Legacy 2, there are a lot of changes that add up to a bigger, better version of the original in almost every way.

The Koei Tecmo-owned studio is best known for its Dynasty Warriors series and giving other series like The Legend of Zelda, Dragon Quest, Gundam, and One Piece massive hack-and-slash facelifts. Three Hopes is its latest translation of the Fire Emblems world.
Warriors took fan-favorite characters and classic heroes like Marth, Tiki, and Lyn from the history of Fire Emblem and let them fight alongside newer faces from Fates and Awakening…]]></summary>

To much excitement and a sign of the times, the embargo has just expired on this super-exciting milestone that many of us have been hoping to see for many years. Over the past two decades NVIDIA has offered great Linux driver support with their proprietary driver stack, but with the success of AMD's open-source driver effort going on for more than a decade, many have been calling for NVIDIA to open up their drivers. Their user-space software is remaining closed-source but as of today they have formally opened up their Linux GPU kernel modules and will be maintaining it moving forward.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you’re a fan of classic Chucks, or someone who’s always wanted shoes emblazoned with your favorite pocket monster on them, then you’re in luck because Pokémon and Converse are teaming up again to do just that. 
Back in January, Converse released a line of shoes that featured Jigglypuff, Meowth, Squirtle, and more, and now, the company has announced its next line of Pokémon shoes, as reported by Kotaku. This time, the iconic Chucks highlight a single Pokémon on each pair. There are Pikachu shoes, Eevee shoes, Charizard shoes, and Mewtwo shoes, and all four pairs look amazing. 

As you can see in the images above, the shoes are designed to match the main color of each Pokémon they represent – the Pikachu shoes are bright yellow, the Eevee shoes a tan-ish brown, the Charizard pair are fire-type orange, and the Mewtwo chucks are a stylish and subdued pink-ish purple. Unfortunately, all signs point to this drop being exclusive to Japan. 
First off, they only seem to be available on Converse’s Japan website, with all four pairs expected to go live this week for roughly $75. There’s also the fact that the shoes feature the Japanese nomenclature of each Pokémon’s name, which is why the Charizard shoes say Lizardon. However, that might just be a styling decision so perhaps there’s a chance that these shoes make their way over to the West sometime in the future. For now, though, it seems you’ll need to navigate the Converse Japan site to secure a pair (or four pairs) of your own. 
In the meantime, check out the most recent Pokémon x Converse team-up and then read about the reveal of Pokémon Violet and Pokémon Scarlet after that.

Yesterday, we learned Gotham Knights would only release on the current generation, leaving PS4 and Xbox One behind, and you know what? I'm glad that's happening, and more studios should consider doing the same thing.

While that’s true, what’s at the heart of the Halo franchise does not change – it’s Master Chief, Cortana, some punchy guns that don’t get old, and a soundtrack that never lets up. Throughout the decades, Chief and Cortana (and buddies like Buck) have found themselves on Earth, Sanghelios, hurtling through space, aboard exploding rings, and more. But no matter the locale, we were finishing the fight – even when some of those battles were more grueling than others.
Sadly, Chief was absent from the fight the Game Informer editors partook in to rank all the Halo games from worst to best.

It's one of those games that's perfect for Game Pass, at least in its current form, but that's going to be changing in a small bit, according to a post devs Straka Studio made yesterday. Straka note they are a small team who playtested with a very small group, and didn't realise the game would be unwelcoming to newcomers. In fact, they've already made some smaller tweaks to the game that have made quite a difference, but the most notable problem players raised was the lack of any, umm, loot?

Next month, we can run off to our favorite Lego supplier to grab an Optimus Prime Lego set. We don't know what it looks like yet, how many pieces are in the box, or how much it will cost, but it's OPTIMUS PRIME! None of that stuff matters. This will likely be a no-brainer purchase for Transformers fans. Here's Lego's official teaser announcement:
Begin the epic build. #LEGO #Transformers #OptimusPrime pic.twitter.com/rjdQbdej43
May 11, 2022
Lego is kicking of Transformers' reign in Lego the right way: with the leader of the Autobots. If this product flies off of shelves (which it likely will), I'd love to see more Transformers get the brick treatment. Megatron would likely be the second set, and what comes next is anyone's guess. Grimlock, Bumblebee, Soundwave, and Starscream are a handful of characters that probably wouldn't be far off.
I'm guessing the brilliant minds at Lego have figured out how to use all of the pieces in the box for two transformations: the robot form and the vehicle. Some Lego sets that already exist use the same pieces for three different builds (meaning we could get some triple changers!)
What do you think of Transformers moving on from Kre-O brick building to Lego? Which characters or action sets would you like to see next?
I'm an avid Lego collector and builder. The only thing that may scare me off of this set is if it is based on the Transformers films. I'm hoping Lego goes with a Generation 1 design, which debuted in the 1980s era cartoon.]]></summary>

This isn't really one of those times, because I think I'd be recommending Songs Of Conquest overall as it is anyway. Giving it an estimated year for Lavapotion to "figure out, together with the community, what features we should prioritize" could well push me into a wholehearted endorsement, though.

My daughter and I worked out a deal that if she plays 20 minutes of Wordscapes, she can then scamper upstairs to play Roblox with her friends for the next two hours. She balked at the idea at first but has taken to enjoying Wordscapes. She periodically asks me for help and cashes in her in-game coins for answers when she has them, but the game is helping her learn, and I’m grateful for it.

Why did I stop playing Warzone? Other games came along, I suppose. Maybe I'd become a bit burned out, which would only be natural considering the amount of hours I spent ducking and trucking. But I think the way it's changed has played a big part in my departure. More specifically, there's been too much change. The game looks bonkers now.

However, that’s where the known quantities end, save for the next EA Sports PGA Tour which was delayed to early 2023, because Quarter 4, which encompasses the January 2023 to March 2023 time period, contains four unknowns: Major IP, Partner Title, Remake, and Sports Title. 
EA notes on the slide that these four titles scheduled for Q4 of the 2023 Fiscal Year “have not yet been publicly disclosed,” which is why the names of those games aren’t listed on the slide. However, those unknowns have us thinking, and theorizing, what they might be.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you've enjoyed murdering monsters and gathering gems in Vampire Survivors, you might fancy a go on Gunlocked. It's an arcade shoot 'em up where you gather random weapons and upgrades (and so many gems) across a run but attacking is kinda out of your hands. I'm not much of a shmupper but Gunlocked has started scratching that Vampire Survivors itch for me, and it's less than £3.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlayStation executive Hiroki Totoki recently told investors in a Sony financial results call that the quality of its first-party games would “deteriorate” if released onto the company’s PlayStation Plus subscription service on launch day.
This news comes by way of Eurogamer, which reports that Totoki said this while also mentioning he doesn’t want to make comments on “the competitor’s strategy,” with the likely competitor being Microsoft and its Xbox Game Pass service. Xbox releases its first-party games onto Xbox Game Pass on launch day and it’s a big pull for the subscription service. PlayStation CEO Jim Ryan has revealed in the past that even with the company’s upcoming revamp of PS Plus, it does not plan to launch first party games there, and Totoki’s latest comments echo that.

Games Montreal released a 13-minute video that delivers a deep look at Gotham Knights' combat, city exploration, suit customization, and the differences between protagonists Nightwing and Red Hood. I walked away from this footage with mixed feelings yet still plenty of excitement for the game's October 25 release.
First, let's start with a positive: It has plenty of the Arkham formula in its coding. The flow of combat, the density of the open world, and the overall dark vibe align nicely with the Arkham series, which this Montreal studio had a hand in with Arkham Origins. Now, the bad: It also reminded me of Crystal Dynamics' Marvel's Avengers game – solely based on the sheer amount of items needed to craft suits and powers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I booted up Citizen Sleeper last night, I had no idea what I was in for. I had seen some buzz about it online and figured I’d give it a go – it was on Xbox Game Pass, after all, and the key art looked precisely the slick and punchy cyberpunk/sci-fi aesthetic I especially like. Little did I know, a few hours later, I’d be playing a game that I’d recommend to anyone at this point. 
Now, I’m about four hours in, and there’s the potential to crash and burn, but something tells me it’s not going to. Citizen Sleeper, as a game, is somewhat hard to explain: It’s a sci-fi, narrative RPG with no combat (at least so far), a dice-rolling mechanic that dictates everything, minor survival systems, and a rotating cast of characters that you’ll immediately want more of upon meeting them.

Rising up from quirky Scotland-based developers with a taste for pulp and crime fiction, Rockstar evolved radically, shifting into innovators and provocateurs, creating some of the industry's most influential and blockbuster titles. In the lead up to the eagerly anticipated Red Dead Redemption 2, we came together as a staff to rank every single game that Rockstar developed (this means we excluded published titles like L.A. Noire and Smuggler's Run). From the humble top-down beginnings of Grand Theft Auto to the blood-soaked streets of Manhunt and the beautiful jaw-dropping vistas of Red Dead Redemption, you’ll find every single title put in its proper place in terms of influence, importance of innovation, and just plain fun.
With all that in mind, let’s steal a ride and roar down this road to hell. Read more...]]></summary>

That’s why it’s been understandably boxed into the fighting/simulation genre. Outside of a few collectible card games and general manager sims, the genre has rarely strayed beyond its competitive roots, and I think that’s a shame. Wrestling can offer so much more to video games. 
The upcoming WrestleQuest is a great example of what you can do with wrestling games if you apply a bit of creativity. The title transforms the core concepts of the sport into a 16-bit RPG inspired by games like Final Fantasy VI and Chrono Trigger. It’s such a refreshing idea, and I can’t wait to see how it turns out when it launches later this year. WWE re…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Inspired by Ready Player One's critical acclaim and the unstoppable rise of cryptocurrencies and NFTs, I'm writing my own dystopian young adult novel about teen rebels who stick it to The Man using the power of the blockchain. While I'm still working on it, publishers and movie producers have already shown great interest. So allow me to treat you, reader dear, to some samples and worldbuilding notes from 1/1, the first drop of the Non-Fungible Future saga.

When asked by a fan (who we've since identified as YouTuber damarcodude) during her recent PAX East 2022 Q&A panel about what she'd like to say to Elder Scrolls head honcho Todd Howard if he were here in person, she had one answer: "Hurry up and finish The Elder Scrolls 6." All right, she technically would have said hello first, but the point still stands.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of my biggest highlights from PAX East a couple of weeks ago was attending Shirley Curry, aka: Skyrim Grandma's panel about her roleplaying adventures in Bethesda's enormous RPG. Despite suffering a stroke just a couple of months beforehand, the 85-year-old YouTuber was on fine form during her PAX East panel, speaking to a packed out theatre of fans and viewers who have spent the better part of six years following her various playthroughs through Skyrim as a multitude of different characters. She talked briefly about her writing and character creation process for her Let's Play-style videos, before spending a whopping 45 minutes answering questions from the audience. These covered everything from her favourite things in Skyrim to her favourite, real-life candy, and also included a surprising number of horror game recommendations. In her own words, she loves stuff that's "weird and creepy", and has recently been looking for something new to play. "I’d really like to play a dark, scary game," she said, and the audience were only too happy to oblige. 
It was a truly wonderful way to spend a Saturday afternoon, and as soon as it was over, both Liam and I knew it was too good not to share. Here's a written transcript of the entire audience Q&A in full, plus a summary of her opening speech, for your reading pleasure.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After nearly 30 years of partnership, EA Sports and FIFA, the international governing body of association football, are parting ways after the release of this year's soccer video game. The announcement comes from a blog post from Electronic Arts that reveals what's next for the footie franchise.
With the current deal dissolving in 2023, EA will no longer use the FIFA name on its popular football series but will instead adopt the moniker of EA Sports FC. It's shedding any licensed identity in the name but still keeping many of its deals with existing football clubs and players. Cam Weber, General Manager of EA Sports, writes in the blog post, "Everything you love about our games will be part of EA Sports FC – the same great experiences, modes, leagues, tournaments, clubs, and athletes will be there." 
Outside of potentially losing the use of the World Cup tournament, it's unclear what else might be missing in future iterations. However, EA is still boasting impressive numbers of players and teams involved moving forward.
Our unique licensing portfolio of more than 19,000+ players, 700+ teams, 100+ stadiums, and 30 leagues that we’ve continued to invest in for decades will still be there, uniquely in EA Sports FC," says Weber. "That includes exclusive partnerships with the Premier League, LaLiga, Bundesliga, Serie A, the MLS – and more to come."
This year's FIFA 23 sounds like it will be business as usual with more features, World Cup content, leagues, clubs, and more and won't be subject to any of these changes. Weber says that we'll have to wait until summer 2023 to hear more of what's to come for EA Sports FC.
How do you feel about this change in branding and partnership? Is FIFA just a name to you, or does it bring something special to EA's brand of virtual soccer? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

These latest swings at Nvidia and their best graphics cards are ostensibly available from today, though third-party retail listings are currently hard to find, and AMD’s own store only lists the RX 6750 and RX 6950 XT... which are both sold out.

They know an important message is to follow, and that everybody in voice chat needs to hear it. Often, when Michael Pusateri is in a work meeting at NBCUniversal that’s going sideways, the same comms command enters his head. "Check, check. Shut up, everyone."


“They’re all talking over each other and nothing’s getting done and it’s spinning into chaos,” says Pusateri, a VP for Creative Technology who goes by Dunk Dinkle in-game. “Why can’t these people who are being paid so much money behave as well as these people who get paid nothing?”

Nope, sorry; it's confirmed only to be two-player, as that's what Batman would've wanted.

Originally conceived as a Kickstarter stretch goal for Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes, the next JRPG from Suikoden creator Yoshitaka Murayama, this smaller, more action-focused RPG has become both an official prequel to Hundred Heroes and a kind of intermediate stop-gap designed to tide players over until the main event next year. Focusing on the back stories of just a handful of the titular hundred you'll be meeting in Rabbit & Bear Studios' spiritual successor to Suikoden (the first of which memorably had a whopping 108 recruitable party members), Rising has the air of almost required reading for players eager to return to the lavish, retro worlds Murayama built his name on.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The RTX 3080 12GB is a little-known variant of the RTX 3080 released late last year. As well as coming with the same memory subsystem as the RTX 3080 Ti - 12GB of GDDR6X attached to a 384-bit interface - it's also faster than the vanilla 3080, with more CUDA and RT cores. 
That performance normally comes at a steep premium, but today an MSI Ventus 3X RTX 3080 12GB model is going for a low price over at Newegg. They're asking $810 for the graphics card after a $30 rebate, some $450 below the GPU's ludicrously high MSRP. That makes this model actually cheaper than almost all RTX 3080 10GB cards on the market, and a worthy deal for our hallowed deal archives.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m testing an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 Ti this week. No fully-formed, review-style thoughts on it yet, though after an unusually stressy installation I do have a question: does it need to be so god-damned big?


“Yes, because heat” is probably the answer, as when you’ve got as many processor cores as the RTX 3090 Ti, running at such high clock speeds as the RTX 3090 Ti, and with as much memory as the RTX 3090 Ti, it’s a bad idea to try building an RTX 3090 Ti that’s the size of a postage stamp. But the best graphics cards aren’t huge as a rule, and when it’s got to the point where new GPUs can’t easily fit into a standard mid-tower PC case, it might be time for some course correction.

You blast through procedurally generated woods and sewers, bursting enemies for cash and channeling your profits into a skill tree that's also your own psyche. It's rad, basically, but its roguelite dusting doesn't quite hit the mark when a literal nightmare is turning into a metaphorical one.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Salt And Sacrifice is a 2D metroidvania hunt-a-thon that casts you as a condemned prisoner in an imperiled kingdom. Magic is corrupting the land, giving rise to monstrous creatures and ravenous undead, and the source of all of this destruction, Mages, must be hunted and their hearts devoured if the Kingdom is to survive. Like Ska Studios’s previous outing, the game features difficult combat, extensive equipment options, and hulking bosses to slay. But while the scale has increased and the combat and visuals are as slick as ever, there are some growing pains that only just manage to hold the game back from its full potential.
Upon booting the game up, it’s immediately clear that you’re in for a visual treat.The design and detail are just ever so lovely: from the way firelight gives a soft glow to its surroundings in the twilight, to how fog wafts lazily over cobble stairways in a musty dungeon, it’s all just so utterly gorgeous to look at. Ska Studios have always had a recognizable art style – imposing architecture and grungy moppets – but it’s plain to see here that they’ve upped their game in the best possible way. According to the devs, every asset was created from scratch, and that care shows in every frame.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I spent much of my childhood hunkered around the family PC using an emulator to run Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Arcade Game. Years have passed since I last played, causing the vague memories to distort into a recollection that’s nothing like reality. In my head, that first arcade game captured the frenetic energy of the TMNT cartoons I’d watch on a Saturday morning. The reality was quite different, with the turtles awkwardly bumbling through Manhattan while occasionally smacking an enemy.
That realisation has never been more apparent than after playing the first two levels of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge, a successor to those early beat ‘em up TMNT arcade games being developed by Tribute Games and published by DotEmu. It captures the aesthetic of those childhood memories and makes them a reality, which is a testament to Tribute Games’ understanding of TMNT as a brand. But it also feels far too familiar, failing to substantially innovate on the original formula.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A niche genre. Games that are best enjoyed with a notepad often involve some mystery, or require drawing strange symbols or shapes that can't be quickly or easily replicated on your PC. They might involve hurried arithmetic, amateurish maps, doodled floorplans, scatter-brained lists. In these cases it transpires that the giant machine whirring three inches from your nose just won't cut it. Sometimes you gotta use a pencil. Here are the 9 best games to play with a notepad.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Razer Naga Trinity is a rather brilliant mouse for MMO gamers, or anyone really that likes or needs to have plenty of buttons right under their thumb. The Naga Trinity's key feature is that it comes with three interchangeable side panels, each with a different amount of layout of buttons - so you can have a regular two-button side layout for FPS titles, a seven-button layout for more complex games (MOBAs?) and a 12-button calculator-style layout when things get properly exciting (MMOs). Or you can just figure out which one is your favourite, and keep it on forever more. 
The Naga Trinity's UK RRP is £110, but it normally goes for about £70 or £80. Today, it's down to £55 - a nice discount!

For its street price of £110, you get a compact yet easy to build in design with a choice of mesh or glass side panels, plus a pair of low profile 120mm fans. Today however, you can pick up this brilliant little case for £76 in black or white, or £85 to £96 for colours like orange, purple, teal and pink. Either way you slice it, this is an incredible case for the money - and I should know, I've got two of them in my room right now.

We sought a lighthearted battle royale having tried loads of others, and were suckered in by the prospect of a Fortnite that didn’t feature people erecting defensive fortresses in milliseconds.
Incredibly, the game has delivered. I'm having fun - albeit with a tinge of unease. Not only does the game act like a blaring reminder that I've lost touch with the Top 40, it's also a bizarre metaverse where nothing is sacred.
