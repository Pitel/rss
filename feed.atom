        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Also known as 'kross-play'.
Mortal Kombat 1 didn't have the best start on the Nintendo Switch, but it's slowly improved over time with some patches fixing up all areas of the game.
It seems Mortal Kombat co-creator Ed Boon also wants to enhance the game's online mode, with the industry veteran recently sharing a poll on social media asking fans what online features they would "like to see the most" and before anything else.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Opinions vary on whether 2005's Boiling Point: Road To Hell was ever, could ever have been, a good game. What's clear is that it was interesting, both as an early example of an open-world RPG and as an infamously broken example of Eurojank. Now it's getting a re-release in just ten days and I'm fascinated to know whether a Boiling Point with fewer bugs has anything to offer the world in 2023.

During Blizzcon, a press conference that is primarily about games made out of electricity and crying (I assume that is what video games are made from), Blizzard announced that two new forms of Diablo are being unleashed on the world. 


Fans of the series can now look forward to a roleplaying game that will be inspired by Diablo IV and will allow them to explore Sanctuary in a whole new way. It is expected to be released at Blizzcon 2024. On top of that, we will also be able to get our hands on Diablo: The Board Game sometime in 2025.

Then, at my behest, all my friends started reading it one after the other until the anime adaptation was announced. Needless to say, I felt absolutely vindicated. I had made a judgment call on a manga, and the world was now taking notice. The anime was produced by an offshoot of A-1 Pictures, CloverWorks, and while this wasn’t their first rodeo, it was one of the first shows I’d seen from the studio.


It was OK. As a whole, the adaptation was serviceable enough for a second season to be greenlit, which led to my friends and I discussing where in the manga season 2 woul…]]></summary>

Well, if you weren't already convinced, the new Mario and Luigi actor Kevin Afghani has now confirmed he's also the voice of Wario. In a brief update on social media, he did a little bit of Wario roleplay while mentioning how he was "going back to play the game" he's in, WarioWare: Move It! on Switch.
This quick update follows a glimpse of the credits in the new WarioWare earlier this week, which places Afghani at the very top of the "voice" page. As you can see, it's already got some Nintendo fans on social media speculating if he'll be handling the voice of Waluigi as well (it seems highly likely at this point).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["It hurts us to have to let you down".
Just months after arriving on the Switch eShop and other platforms, the free-to-play online "footbrawler" Omega Strikers will be wrapping up development after it ships its next update. The team at Odyssey Interactive is making this tough decision in order to guarantee the future of the studio.
In a video update, Odyssey mentions how servers and matchmaking for the title will stay online, and balance updates will continue to be released in the foreseeable future. The custom games tool will also be polished up, but beyond this, there won't be any new strikers, passes, skins or maps.

As it turns out, the depths of its library are pretty murky. I had not heard of 1993’s Mazin Saga: Mutant Fighter. In fact, if I had heard of it, I probably wouldn’t have been interested in playing it. And that would have been a shame. I would never know what an interesting game it is. On the other hand, my pride would still be intact.

You don't need me to tell you that fake video games appearing in TV shows and movies are typically absurd and terrible. But just because something is bad, doesn't mean it's uninteresting. Having watched dozens of movies and episodes with fake video games, I'm going to celebrate a few over the coming weeks. Some daft fake games have neat ideas, some shows portray their fake games in an interesting way, and some fake games are even quite good. Let's start now with Deadware, an unknown horror movie which does a great job recreating something a bit bad: a spOooky haunted browser game from 1999.

The demo kicks off with a conversation between a few silhouettes, and the dialogue sounds like it’s pulled from Killer7. They’re talking about the sun getting bigger.


You’re then dropped on the beach in front of a surreal, upscale resort. After a quick look around, you head inside and get inundated with insults and demands from the posh clientele.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Even though Warcraft Rumble just released today, or yesterday for some regions, its first Season is already under way. The first season focuses on a new playable leader, Sylvanas Windrunner. Players will be able to add Sylvanas to their collection of Leaders via the Guild Warchest, PvP, or via the store. She will also be added to the G.R.I.D. at the start of Season 2.




Sylvanas seems like a pretty interesting Leader, having played Warcraft Rumble just a little bit. Here are her base abilities and talents:


Abilities



Bowshot: Baseline attack is a ranged, single target, physical damage.


Haunt: On death, Sylvanas summons a Banshee unit which operates just like a normal Banshee.


Leader Ability: Windrunner Warchief (Passive): Horde and Undead minis near Sylvanas gain a movement speed boost.



Talents



Black Arrow: Pierce through enemies in a line, dealing Elemental damage.


Banshee's Wail: Scream on Death, Stunning nearby enemies for 3 seconds.


Forsaken Fury: Horde and Undead near Sylvanas gain Fury.



Blizzard seems pretty invested in Warcraft Rumble, and honestly, from what I've played, it's pretty fun. It's cool to see it launching with a new season...I'm excited to see what other Leaders we'll see in the future.

Well, it's back! In Classic form.


World of Warcraft Cataclysm Classic is coming in 2024 with "feedback" in tow


WoW: Classic, the "what's old is new again" re-release of older expansions, is moving beyond Wrath of the Lich King in the next year. As was the case with prior WoW Classic updates, Cataclysm Classic will not be a 1:1 recreation of the original expansion that debuted in 2010. Instead, it'll involve "feedback" from the community (and a heap of quality of life changes), which will be clarified…]]></summary>

Details were sparse, but the expansion will focus on Mephisto, one of the three Prime Evils. The expansion will take place in the Jungles of Torajan and feature a brand new class.




According to Blizzard the expansion is still early on in development and more information will be available in Summer 2024. No firm release date was provided, but the brief trailer revealed a timeframe of Late 2024.


Timing wise it makes sense, as Blizzard confirmed earlier this year that Diablo 4 will receive annual expansions alongside its quarterly seasons. This likely means we will have another two or even three seasons before the Vessel of Hatred expansion releases.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[BlizzCon 2023 is less than 30 minutes away, but Overwatch 2 fans won't have to wait to get a glimpse of the next hero coming to the shooter. Fans over at the /r/Overwatch/ reddit noticed an ad on the Nintendo Switch News tab indicating the upcoming hero, Mauga, will be available for a free trial weekend.


/u/Ready2Rumbl3 on Reddit


The beefy hero Mauga wields dual chainguns to shred his enemies. Mauga will join Overwatch 2 as part of Season 8 which releases on December 5.


Chances are Blizzcon will officially announce Mauga when BlizzCon 2023 kicks off, and it appears the hero will be playable via a trial weekend ahead of his release.




UPDATE: As expect, Mauga has been confirmed as the new hero at BlizzCon 2023. Mauga will dualwield chainguns he named Gunny and Cha-Cha, as he mows through front-lines. Abilities appear to be:



Incendiary Chaingun — Ignites enemies.


Volatile Chaingun — Crits burning enemies.


Overrun — Unstoppable charge.


Cardiac Overdrive — Damages enemies while Mauga gains life.


Cage Fight — Infinite ammunition



As previously mentioned, Mauga will indeed release in Overwatch 2 on all platforms on December 5.

"Victor is actually the first French fighter for the TEKKEN franchise," said Harada. "I have had the idea of a French character in my mind for a long time and it finally came to fruition. Thanks to Vincent Cassel for inspiring me and for voicing him. And the stage is Paris itself, where I took my first Seine River cruise over 20 years ago."




Oui, oui, oui!

According to French website Le Figaro, no date has been set for the presentation just yet, but soon enough, Aonuma will be joining his Nintendo teammate Shigeru Miyamoto as a recipient of the title. Does this mean that the guys behind Zelda are technically real-life knights? Yes, it does. Does that mean that they can carry swords? Uhhh, no.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We're all very much familiar with the rocky star Cyberpunk 2077 had when it launched nearly three years ago. Fortunately, CD Projekt Red has been able to turn things around, and the studio wants the game to have a successful evolution going forward.


According to a recent interview with PC Gamer, narrative director for CDPR Igor Sarzyński hopes Cyberpunk will enjoy a "similar evolution" to the Witcher series. By this, they're referring to the significant ways each subsequent entry changed for the better.




What that means going forward, we can't be certain. However, with the developer now working on the follow-up to Cyberpunk 2077, the team will no doubt be taking on-board lessons learned for both this and the new Witcher saga that's currently in development.


A mended reputation.


Despite the differences between the two IPs, CD Projekt Red were able to (eventually) pull off a successful RPG in something more futuristic than The Witcher. There were certainly new things for the developer to learn, and Sarzyński explains that while some aspects worked "out of the box," others required a bit more work.



Now with all the game elements iterated and working well, we’ll focus on connecting them even tighter and creating a coherent, total immersion experience.




With the recent 2.0 patch and Phantom Liberty DLC only improving things further, the game is now in the state that some would argue should have been the case at the start. Either way, CDPR is looking to evolve Cyberpunk 2077 as it moves forward with the franchise.

Yes, the toys-to-life craze may have been a fad in the mid-2010s, and Nintendo's line of NFC figures (and cards) was essentially an experimental side project as the firm sought to diversify and distract while regrouping during The Lean Wii U Years™, but amiibo, somehow, are still going in 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Vampire Survivors is getting an Adventures update that will add "self-contained miniature story modes that reset and remix the game's content, following the Survivor's cast on a series of wacky sidequests". That's according to developer Poncle, who are clearly in a whimsical mood this week. After all, if there's one thing this game about auto-massacring ever larger crowds of kamikaze night creatures has been lacking, it's some proper narrative context.

I know Saga's an infinitely better hang than Alan, but trust me on this. You are ignoring what is arguably the best 15 minutes of video game you'll play all year. Don't make the same mistake I did and play as Saga for 20 hours, only to realise that this utter masterpiece of a level was sitting here the entire time. Do the right thing. Continue Alan's story.

We're only a couple of weeks away from the launch of Super Mario RPG on November 17th, 2023, so you might currently be pondering just how faithful the remake will be to the SNES original.
Well, you can already check out our hands-on impressions of the game, but if you're after some good old-fashioned side-by-side comparisons, then we've got your back. Our lovely video producer Felix has put together a compilation of scenes from both the remake and the original to highlight what exactly has been changed and what's stayed the same.

You've surely seen a hundred post-Minecraft games about building a base to smelt iron to build a base, and probably even thought to yourself that they look entirely fine but kind of... redundant? There's only so many times you can walk back and forth from a cave to a forge.
But what if instead of trudging around a grey cave, you were driving a big drilling machine instead? It's so simple, and yet it makes all the difference in GeoDepths.

Rumours of Nintendo's next console — the one that we are still preliminarily referring to as the 'Switch 2' — have continued to come thick and fast this year and, if they are to be believed, all signs are pointing towards an announcement and release in 2024. Many of these rumours are built on hearsay, but the tech experts over at Digital Foundry have been digging into something more concrete: the chip that it is believed sits at the heart of the Switch successor.
Of course, none of this is official for the moment (the amount of official 'Switch 2' news out there wouldn't fill the back of a postage stamp), but Digital Foundry states that the chip in question, dubbed Nvidia's T239, is almost certainly tied to a Nintendo project due to how it continues to support the "console-specific graphics API" that was used on the original Switch's Tegra chip. In short, it's all rather interesting.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Final Fantasy XIV’s world of Eorzea is a utopia. Sure, there’s the looming threat of Garlean invasion and/or the possibility of world destruction throughout A Realm Reborn and its expansions - but on the plus side, almost everyone you meet is up for a round of cards.


Over the last quarter-century, Triple Triad has managed to escape its origins as a fun side minigame in Final Fantasy VIII to become a fully-fledged phenomenon in XIV. The Gold Saucer runs regular tournaments, random strangers are happy to be challenged to a match - often throwing in one or more of the game’s many variant rules (though Chaos can do one) - and might even give up one of their prized cards when defeated, with almost 400 to collect as of the game’s latest patches. Emphasis on the “might”: I dread to think of the hours spent replaying NPCs in the hope of a random drop as I filled out my collection.

I headed along to Final Fantasy’s London Fan Fest last month with a fetching deck of Triple Triad cards in hand. (Square Enix provided entrance and accommodation for the event.) Where better to try and live the dream of challenging random strangers to a card game, and learn more about the community that has fallen in love with the MMO in the 10 years since A Realm Reborn released?

I’m not sure where to begin with this. I guess for anyone still in their early-20s or younger, a cassette tape is a cartridge the size of a standard Kit-Kat bar. They’re called “tapes” because their data is contained on a thin strip of plastic covered in a film conductive to magnetism. It stores data by magnetizing portions of it. It’s a lot like how a hard drive works.


Oh, wait, I guess a lot of hard drives are solid-state these days.


Anyway, these cassette tapes were often used to store music that could be played directly from a home stereo, but they could really hold any kind of data. Early home computers would often use them to store f…]]></summary>

In the interview, she discusses her experience working with Kojima. She describes how dedicated Kojima was to the project and how he would attend many of the motion capture sessions. He is also described as an amazing visionary with ideas "so large in span that the actors, including me, would often ask for more input on the characters' motivations and the world we were in."

If you've got the time to spare, you can check out the patch notes for the game, which lists a bunch of fixes, tweaks, and quality-of-life changes. Everything from the audio to the visuals to the UI have been given some TLC, so Payday 3 should be in a better state now.




However, for those waiting on word about a possible offline mode for the game, there's no mention of that here. That's something the developer is considering, but we don't know if or when it's likely to be implemented.

Of the hundreds of versions of A Christmas Carol that we’re all bombarded with in the lead-up to the Holidays, very few give any thought to what comes after Scrooge is visited by the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Future. The focus is firmly on how he becomes a changed man and not what he actually does with his newfound joy and Christmas spirit. Ebenezer and the Invisible World makes the bold proposition that Scrooge would become a ghost-thrashing, high-jumping champion of the common people and we're here for it.
Set several years after the events of Dickens’ novel, Ebenezer and The Invisible World sees the miser-turned-saint as something of a bridge between the spirit and the material worlds. His encounter with the Ghosts of Christmas left him able to see the souls of those who could not cast off their chains of misery and cruelty as he has, leaving him the only one capable of aiding them on their quest for peace. It is a fun play on the original story we know so well and it immediately drew us in.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Vampire Survivors has always brought the lore but lacked a real narrative, but that ends with Patch 1.8. As part of the update, “Adventures” mode is coming, giving some story to chew on.


That might be stretching it somewhat. The Adventures are remixes of content already in the game. They look to be separate microcosms of the main game, giving you a separate batch of unlocks. To shoot for. Each one follows part of the cast as they go through missions and tackle sidequests.




The trailer doesn’t really hint at dialogue or cutscenes, so the narrative looks to be more implied than explicit. Honestly, trying to envision Vampire Survivors with any sort of dialogue doesn’t work for me. Then, going further and imagining it with voice acting makes me want to retch. Low budget is basically its aesthetic. It looks like a bootleg Castlevania, and really works it as an identity.


The Adventures mode is free, and while there will only be a few chapters at first, more will keep getting added along the way. Vampire Survivors’ 1.8 patch will also include the usuals, including new “characters, weapons, and stages.”


There’s no date on Vampire Survivors 1.8. However, the FAQ says that it will launch “soon” for all platforms.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Haha, what? Ziggurat Interactive has announced that they have teamed up with Big Boat to re-release 2005’s incredible kusoge, Boiling Point: Road to Hell on November 14, 2023.


This game and I have history. Back when it released, everyone was looking to what the next generation in graphics would bring to the open-world genre. Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion was still on the horizon with its big promises, but we needed something now. So, my tightly-knit group of friends and I started poking at Boiling Point: Road to Hell in the interim. Its world was advertised at 25x25km.


When Boiling Point first launched, it was buggy beyond reason. I’m pretty sure I tapped out earlier, as I didn’t yet have my constitution for bad games. However, at least one of my friends pushed a lot deeper into it. I don’t think he completed it.




They’d later patch the game, at which point it (maybe) gained a few fans. I tried it again at that point, and I remember getting into the open world before abruptly losing interest. I distinctly remember being in the middle of the jungle and thinking, “yeah, no.”


The game is about Saul Myers, whose daughter was kidnapped in Realia, a fictional (heh) South American Country that, if I recall, is under the thumb of organized crime and corrupt politicians. As mentioned, it’s an open-world game in an impractically massive environment. Big Boat is making “major improvements to the game’s stability” to Boiling Point to make this the definitive version. No widescreen, though?


This is amazing news. I’m not even being sarcastic. I’m going to have to find time to play this again. Maybe with my time-embiggened gamer brain, I can actually get through it.


Brace yourself because Boiling Point: Road to Hell is being re-released on November 14, 2023 on GOG and Steam.

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2023/11/03/hbos-the-last-of-us-season-2-set-to-premiere-in-2025"/>
        <updated>2023-11-03T12:02:03.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this year, HBO's The Last of Us successfully brought developer Naughty Dog's critically acclaimed and fan-favorite PlayStation exclusive to life on the TV screen. Its Season 1 premiere was HBO's second-largest debut since 2010, and its second episode broke records, too. Roughly three weeks after the premiere of the series, HBO revealed The Last of Us would be getting a second season. And now, thanks to a new Deadline report, we know it will start shooting next year and premiere sometime in 2025. 
Deadline learned this at a New York news event, where HBO boss Casey Bloys reportedly told press that Season 2 will head into production early next year, aiming for a 2025 premiere. Unfortunately, that's all Bloys said about the season. But, as noted by Deadline, series co-creator and executive producer Craig Mazin revealed earlier this summer pre-strike that the team was already able to get some work done, adding that the first episode was already written. 


"We got pretty far actually, we were doing great," Mazin told Deadline. "[The Last of Us game co-creator Neil Druckmann] and I had been sitting and talking with [The Last of Us Part II co-writer Halley Gross] and Bo Shim, the new writer that was in our little tiny room with us – obviously not a mini room because we're greenlit proper, we're a real show, and because I hate that mini room stuff."
Considering the first season of The Last of Us covered the events of the first Last of Us game, including its Left Behind DLC, it's clear Season 2 of the show will dive into The Last of Us Part II. We're all still awaiting some casting announcements, like who will play Abby and Lev, but that likely won't happen until the actor and writer strikes are over. 
In the meantime, read Game Informer's The Last of Us Part 1 review and then read our review of The Last of Us Part II.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a confession to make, readers. I'm mildly obsessed with Starfield's cuboid food brand Chunks. In all honesty, I'm kinda obsessed with Starfield's food in a more general sense, and I have almost as many screenshots of its tube-like meal boxes, stale toast slices, vacuum-packed sachets of rice balls, steak slabs and spiced worms - and, of course, Chunks - as I do its planets and NPCs. I'm weirdly fascinated by what Bethesda think our future meals will look like when we eventually start travelling across the stars, and not just because I like ragging on their somewhat plastic-looking textures and marvelling at how everything from orange juice to beer and wine comes in kid's size cartons with a little straw on the side. 
Chunks are my favourite food of the lot, though. These cubes of faintly glistening organic matter are bite-sized monstrosities that are quite possibly some of the most unholy things I've ever seen. How this became the dominating foodstuff across the known galaxy is a mystery worthy of its own sidequest, because let's be honest, I'm all for eating wonky fruit and vegetables, but would you truly go to shop, sit down at a table and order an apple that's been squeezed into a perfect cube? Or a cube with yellow skin that professes to call itself grilled chicken? I would probably try them once for curiosity's sake (it's the food of the future, of course I want to know what that tastes like!), but it's also exactly the kind of thing I'd swear off immediately because nope, nuh uh, I just can't even contemplate it anymore. And then it dawned on me: this is exactly how I feel about Starfield as a whole.

While it's technically Season 5 of Fortnite Chapter 4, which follows the previous Last Resort season, developer Epic Games is calling it Season OG, and it makes sense considering how much of Fortnite 2018 is making an appearance.
The throwback nostalgia continues throughout the season because each new update brings with it a different phase of Fortnite Chapter 1's past, starting with Season 5. That means weapons like the Assault Rifle and Pump Shotgun, and vehicles like Shopping Carts, will be featured in both Zero Build and regular Battle Royale Fortnite.

WarioWare: Move It is full of truly surprising games that take advantage of the Switch's unique control options, but it's arguably always the most fun to see what retro Nintendo games make it into any WarioWare collection.

WarioWare: Move It! is finally available on the Nintendo Switch today and we've seemingly got a confirmation on the voice actor (it appears to be Kevin Afghani). In addition to this, Nintendo has also released some new themed Switch Online icons for the game.
All of this has left us wondering if our community here will be diving into Wario's latest microgame offering. In our review here on Nintendo Life, we called it a fine return and awarded it a solid 8 out of 10 stars. So vote in our poll and leave a comment.

RoboCop: Rogue City is likely the best game the action hero has ever starred in. That bar isn’t tough to hurdle, but the adventure delivers plenty of thrills for fans to be excited about. This narrative-driven first-person shooter has a loving reverence for the films and a good understanding of its protagonist, swinging for the fences with a lengthy original story, fun references, and plenty of enjoyably cheesy humor. Unfortunately, like the franchise’s vision of Detroit, Rogue City is very rough around the edges, resulting in a flawe…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the wake of devastating layoffs at Destiny 2 developer Bungie, the studio has said this week has been “one of the most difficult weeks” in the studio’s history. To move forward, it is now committed to making the upcoming Destiny 2: The Final Shape expansion one of “the best games we’ve ever made.” 


“We know we have lost a lot of your trust,” the Destiny 2 development team wrote in a blog post. “Destiny needs to surprise and delight. We haven’t done this enough and that’s going to change.”


To start, the studio says it has “more than 650 dedicated teammates pouring all their energy and expertise into delivering” The Final Shape, in addition to the Episodes that will follow. Bungie says fans can expect to hear more about the future of Destiny 2 “in the weeks ahead.”


In the latest example of a long line of games industry layoffs, Bungie laid off an estimated 100 employees according to Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier in late October. Schreier also reports The Final Shape will see a delay, as well as Marathon.


This instance is simply the latest in a long string of layoffs and shutdowns in the games industry. Other studios that have experienced layoffs include Epic Games, CD Projekt Red, Naughty Dog, Twitch, and Ubisoft, among many, many others. Studios that have been shut down include Volition Games, Dang!, Vanpool, and PixelOpus.

Max Payne popularized bullet time in video games, while Control was one of the most complex implementations of ray tracing at its launch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are very pleased to announce today the start of the testing period of two single-game engines: Kingdom: The Far Reaches and Escape From Hell!
Kingdom, was developed and released by Interplay in 1995. Only the DOS version of the game (available on gog.com) is supported. It's a cartoon FMV game, with an inventory, in which you have to guide Lathan Kandor through a medieval world, discovering the magic spells and the items required to defeat an evil wizard. 
Escape From Hell, was developed for Electronic Arts by the game veterans Richard Seaborne and Alan Murphy and was released in 1990. You play Alan in this keyboard-only Role Playing Game and visit Hell, looking for your girlfriend who was accidentally teleported there.
Both games use heavily hardcoded logic which is error prone and requires a lot of testing, so we need your feedback more than ever as they are both incompletely tested. There is sadly only one known demo for Kingdom. Support for the Windows and Mac versions of Kingdom may come later! Please contact us if you have some other demos of both games.
To play any of these games, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker and please take some screenshots along the way!

Until now, because without hyperbole (okay, with some), the 8BitDo Retro Mechanical Keyboard is the one I want to be touching until I die. And that’s not because of ergonomics, reliability, or how hardcore the key mechanics are; it’s because of its look.


Gosh, it’s gorgeous.

I’m a bit of a weird choice to review a keyboard, but I wasn’t going to say no when I was offered one for review. I only know the general details about what makes one keyboard better than the other. I worked in IT for nearly 10 years, and the only thing that lawyers and en…]]></summary>

In dozens of local and international news reports, this 'official' figure is cited verbatim. We have zero faith in it, and we aren't alone. After a silent unreferenced edit, the police press release now reads €366,250, but the government's copy remains intact.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mortal Kombat 1 has a hell of a DLC lineup on the way. Today's Omni-Man gameplay trailer showcases why he may just be the most badass of the bunch when he arrives this month.


Just as in the Invincible animated Amazon series, Omni-Man is voiced by the ridiculously awesome J.K. Simmons. Throughout the trailer, NetherRealm Studios shows off the actor's skills as he relentlessly mocks Liu Kang and his allies prior to beating the hell out of them. 




We've seen what Omni-Man is capable of in a previous Mortal Kombat 1 trailer. But today's video puts the Viltrumite's full abilities on display. He's brutal, nimble, and of course, deadly. You don't need a subway train to showcase that. 


A new kameo fighter is also on the way alongside Omni-Man's debut next week. Tremor, who originally debuted in 2000's Mortal Kombat: Special Forces, is a ninja like Sub-Zero and Scorpion but with earth powers. He pairs nicely as a kameo higher alongside Omni-Man. While the Invincible villain is pulling meteors from the atmosphere and smashing opponents with them, Tremor is doing the same with giant boulders right here from Earth. 


Both combatants will join the fray on November 9 for those with the Kombat Pack. They are available a week later for everyone else as standalone DLC.


Following that, there's plenty more DLC in the pipeline. Quan-Chi and DC's Peacemaker are slated for sometime in the winter. Ermac and The Boys' Homelander are planned for spring. The apprentice of Scorpion himself, Takeda Takahashi, should be out as a playable fighter next summer. And Ferra, Janet Cage, Khameleon, and Mavado are all in the works as additional kameo fighters. 


If you haven't given Mortal Kombat 1 a try, perhaps you should. In Destructoid's review, we thought it was great.

It's the city, personified


Peter and Miles often face an onslaught of action in New York, but Spider-Man 2 side quests offer moments of respite. They're opportunities to truly live in the Big Apple, listening to citizens' stories, and enjoying an extra puzzle or two.

Perhaps among the more noteworthy includes 2021's Aliens: Fireteam Elite, a third-person survival shooter with both PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 versions. Back in the day, Destructoid reviewed the title, scoring it at a whopping 5.5. 


Fireteam Elite sees a squad of three marines, whether cooperatively with friends or alongside AI, explore the caves and ruins of the mysterious planet LV-895. Players can build up their marine's skills across six different classes with 130 different perks. All in an effort to fend off Xenomorphs, Spitters, a…]]></summary>

This one was announced back in September and came to other platforms last month while the team put the finishing touches on the Switch version. The 'Whiteout' update adds a suitably snowy new stage, a new seasonal survivor character, a wintery weapon and a handful of other fun features (enough alliteration for you?).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are quite a few here at Destructoid that are big into anime, so this is for them as well. For a limited time only, Twitch is offering viewers a free trial of Crunchyroll, the hit animation streaming service, for your viewing pleasure. 


As outlined in a recent Twitch blog post, the Amazon-owned platform is providing a 60-day trial of Crunchyroll Mega Fan Premium membership. This means you'll get to watch all your favorite anime and manga shows without ads.


Image via Twitch.


Of course, it's not as simple as just holding out your hand and waiting for the trial to drop into it. There are a few provisos before you can qualify. Because of course there are.


*Sigh* Okay, what do I have to do?


For starters, the campaign is only being run for this month, so you have until November 30 to get your free trial. In exchange for the Crunchyroll membership, you'll need to purchase "two new Twitch subs and/or gift subs."


The type of Twitch subscriptions and gifted subs that are eligible include:



New monthly subs (any tier)


Multi-month subs (3-month, 6-month)


Gift subs (any tier for any number of months)



Prime subs, existing sub renewals, bits, turbos, and a bunch of others don't qualify.


It's also worth noting that it's only available on "participating channels streaming in the Just Chatting, Art, and One Punch Man: World categories." You also can't qualify for the offer if you live in any of the following countries:



Russia


Ukraine


Cuba


China


Iran


Japan


North Korea


Syria


South Sudan


Sudan



What else? Oh, yeah: "existing or past Crunchyroll members or users who have previously claimed a Crunchyroll free trial in the past year are not eligible."


I think that covers everything. As is typical with these types of deals, there are plenty of Ts & Cs before you qualify. If you do quality, happy days. If not... Young Sheldon, I guess.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Like when Sir Alex Ferguson oversaw his final game at Old Trafford, there’s a complicated atmosphere surrounding this year’s Football Manager. Football Manager 2024 is the last iterative game in the series before Project Dragonfly arrives next year, through which Sports Interactive plan the most radical overhaul of the game since the introduction of the 3D match engine in FM 09. This includes a complete rebuild of Football Manager in Unity, implementing brand new animation technology, and the inclusion of women’s football. But there is a reason why the studio has stuck with this tried and tested formula for so long. Big changes come with big risks, and as any Man Utd fan will know, those changes don’t always pay off.


But such concerns are for the future. FM24 is with us right now, and while it may be swapping the dugout for the stands ninety minutes from now, this isn’t some ceremonial exhibition match. It’s business as usual, and in mostly good ways. Sports Interactive have made meaningful changes to the management game both on and off the pitch, all built on top of fundamentals that remain as complex and compulsive as they have for years. That said, FM24 also demonstrates why a change is welcome, as in its current form it can struggle to strike the balance between authenticity and fun.

I rarely replay games, let alone horror games, which are often one-and-done sorts of things - though I do, of course, enter the Pumpkin Carving Festival every year.
I want something that has a general air of spookiness without being a jumpscare frightfest. If I hadn't played The Tartarus Key already I'd be playing that, is what I'm saying.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Amidst all the remakes that are crowding the current gaming market, Skyblivion is definitely one to look out for. While there's still some time until we can expect a proper release date, the team behind the ambitious Oblivion remake has released a hair-raising video update.


Over on YouTube, the unofficial fan remake of TES4 lets its cape down to bring a more sinister vibe in promoting Skyblivion. The video showcases some of the darker and scarier elements of this Oblivion reimagining.




Among other things, we get a glimpse of some areas that have been given a new spit shine in Skyrim's engine, including Hackdirt and Arkved’s Tower. We also get a look at some new monsters that have been made specifically for this project. There's even a quest walkthrough, as well.


When is it coming out?


At the moment, there's no definite release window for Skyblivion yet, outside a likely 2025 launch. It is, after all, quite the undertaking, completely reimagining Oblivion in Skyrim's engine. Volunteers are always welcome as well, if you do want to lend a hand.


We've seen in the past that the remake is coming along nicely, and with each update we get, we move closer to the project becoming available.


Having started back in 2012, the fan remake has been in development for over 13 years at this point. However, it's looking more and more like it's going to be worth it in the end. You'll also be pleased to know that it'll be completely free, providing you have legitimate copies of Oblivion and Skyrim (natch).

        <updated>2023-11-02T16:48:02.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Larian Studios has pushed through a massive Patch 4 to Baldur’s Gate 3, applying over 1000 fixes, tweaks and changes. Accessibility is a major focus of this patch, in addition to other fixes applied to the hirelings system, combat, and UI.


To start, the team has implemented a setting that allows color-blind players to choose between protanopia, deuteranopia, or tritanopia, which applies to character outlines, circles, character map markers, frame portraits in turn order, and party portraits. For those unfamiliar, protanopia and deuteranopia corresponds to red-green color vision deficiency, while tritanopia is blue-yellow.


In addition, the appearance of hirelings can now be customized when recruiting them. Also, dead avatars can be sent to Withers’ Wardrobe of Wayward Friends, and the enigmatic skeleton will explain how the feature works for those who are unfamiliar.


In terms of gameplay, several autosaves have been added to the Shadowlands, Wyrm’s Crossing, and the Lower City, including at the Steel Watch Foundry, the Iron Throne, and Rivington. There is now an option to make the ‘end turn’ button need to be held rather than tapped, for those of us who needed that.


I think one of the fixes I’m the least happy about is in the fight with a certain boss in Act 3. It’d seem you can no longer push him into a chasm, because apparently logic kicks in and he remembers he has a natural defense to sudden gravitational shifts.


Also, one of the most important things in Act 3 has been corrected — Yenna now returns to camp after the avatar of Bhaal kidnaps one of your friends instead of inexplicably disappearing. I always wondered about where she went, but it made such a minimal impact on my campaign that I just shrugged it off.

Previously, Boku no Natsuyasumi 2 was only released in Japan on PS2 (later ported to PSP). For that matter, the entire series never really left Japan. Part of the sudden rush is due to more Western awareness of the titles, especially in the wake of Action Button’s six-hour review on the title. It’s really hard to write that out without adding an expletive. Let’s just say I don’t have the attention span to watch it.


I also often joke that, because Boku no Natsuyasumi is popular, I probably wouldn’t like it. In all honesty, it’s probably directly up my alley. The title translates pretty directly to “My Summer Vacation,” but …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Nintendo Museum’s sign and official logo were recently revealed by Nintendo Japan on their official Instagram account. Although the sign isn’t super flashy or extravagant, it still looks crisp and welcoming for future fans to admire while paying a visit to the historical site.


During a Direct in September, the gaming giant teased fans with the museum. In the Instagram post that Nintendo Japan posted on October 26, the sign and logo can be seen from a number of different perspectives, showing off the sign from different times of the day.


Currently, the museum is under construction in Uji City, Kyoto Prefecture, near Kyoto, Japan. The renovations and construction work are set to be completed in March 2024. The sole purpose of the long-awaited project is to provide fans with a glimpse of the company’s legacy, history, and highlights through a well-laid-out collection of its past.


History of the Nintendo Museum Site


Image via Nintendo


Back in 2021, Nintendo announced the renovation of one of their old facilities, its Uji Ogura Plant. First built in 1969, the plant’s original purpose was to produce playing cards and Hanafuda cards. Later on, the plant became a customer service hub, for the company’s products to be repaired. 


The renovations announced include both the plant and the land surrounding it. Originally, this project was planned to be called the Nintendo Gallery with a similar concept and approach to its current museum idea.


We'll hopefully see more than just a sign in the months to come, leading up to the Nintendo Museum's opening.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While Rishi Sunak bundles nerds into Bletchley Park, we at the Electronic Wireless Show podcast are investigating the real danger of AI: somewhat rubbish text-to-speech voicelines making The Finals less fun. We discuss the arrival of AI voices in big-name games, the disappointingly businessy thinking behind it, and whether we can think up some uses for AI-generated material that we can actually get behind. All sparked by voice actor Gianni Matragrano’s video compilation of the lines in question, which you should probably watch before listening to this episode, or there’ll be a bit where Nate appears to bellow "THE KING FISH" for no reason. Well, maybe not no reason. It’s still Nate.


Plus! We talk about what we’ve been playing this week, which coincidentally for me was The Finals, while Nate’s been digging deeper into the Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor demo. I also recount the teeth-based controversy surrounding Cities: Skyline 2, in turn begging the question: what are they going to do with all those teeth?

It's billed as a detective game for true crime fans, but it reminds me of those puzzle books you used to get, where you are shown an illustration of a crime scene and, if you stare at it long enough, can figure out the assigned solution. Scene Investigators is like that but the scene is a big 3D one you can walk around. A crime has happened and you need to figure out what, mostly by peering at the dates in a diary to cross reference them with the time and day a phone message was left. This is why I wouldn't recommend it to everyone. It's quite hard. But! Some people will really like it.

After last week's announcement that Disney Dreamlight Valley will be officially leaving early access on 5th December (and no longer as a free-to-play game), publisher and developer Gameloft has hosted a showcase to share what we can expect to see coming to the title over the next few months.
The first big announcement to come our way was that The Nightmare Before Christmas' Jack Skellington will be stepping into the Valley as a part of the game's eighth content update (also releasing on 5th December). According to the Dreamlight Valley blog, you should keep an eye on the "most moody biome" for hints of his arrival.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The android is unresponsive, standing frozen mid-step with one foot off the ground. I hold its metal head in my hands, tilting it this way and that as I stare into its cold red eye. It offers no resistance to my pushes and pulls, as though I was a hairdresser directing a patron’s head. Based on Stanisław Lem’s 1964 novel of the same name, The Invincible’s Firewatch-like first-person adventure is intent on exploring how machines will come to shape humanity’s future. Over the course of its ten-hour story, where you step into the Soviet-styled space boots of biologist Yasna, you will take on her desperate search for the missing crew of her research ship, The Dragonfly, lost somewhere on the rocky, sandstorm-whipped world of Regis III.
Using a logbook filled with hand-drawn maps and scrawled notes, I’ve tracked Yasna’s crew to a makeshift game to the east of where they originally landed. Instead of humans, I find the lifeless robot. I want the android to give me answers, to tell me where my crew mates are, to explain what happened on Regis III, and why I can’t remember anything before I woke up in the desert with my possessions scattered around me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fortnite Chapter 4: Season 4 has been one of the best seasons for Epic Games' battle royale in a while, bringing vampires, heists, and more to the game. But it ends this week, with Epic bringing players back to the Chapter 1 map for the next season of Chapter 4. Thanks to a new trailer released today, we know this throwback season is called Season OG, is a part of Chapter 4, and will be bringing with it a heavy dose of nostalgia. 
That's showcased best in today's trailer, which highlights the throwback drop spot of Tilted Towers while Juice WRLD's "Lucid Dreams" plays. Tilted Towers looks as good as we remember it, and you can check it out in the Fortnite Chapter 4: Season OG – Return to Tilted Towers gameplay trailer for yourself below: 


Fortnite Chapter 4: Season OG, this chapter's fifth chapter, goes live tomorrow on November 3.

Back in the '90s, Nintendo played faster and looser with its library of characters. Sometimes Yoshi showed up in The Legend of Zelda, and Kirby was whatever color he felt like at the moment, be it gray or pink. In 1996, that laissez-faire attitude was in full effect for the release of Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars for the Super Nintendo. Link, Samus, and even Donkey Kong (sort of) all had inexplicable cameos in the game, and one of my big questions about the remake was whether or not those would move forward. If you're ready to learn the answer for at least some of them, read on!
Impressively, the answer is yes! At least for Link and Donkey Kong. I have not been able to play to the point in the game where Samus appears, so I can't answer that question yet. When you get close to Link after seeing him in the sleeping bed, a "talk" option appears, and when you click it, a Zelda musical sting plays.
Donkey Kong's cameo has always been questionable as to whether or not it is him, as he is just labeled "Guerilla", but he sure looks a lot like Donkey Kong, just with a crown.

The Super Mario RPG remake releases November 17 for Nintendo Switch.

Ahead of his debut, NetherRealm Studios has released the official Omni-Man gameplay trailer and alongside hard-hitting (and gory) super moves, it features a brutal and show-accurate fatality for the character. 
The trailer teases Liu Kang for allowing a Viltrumite into the Realms of Mortal Kombat before more than two minutes of Omni-Man action plays out. And closing out the trailer is the fatality for the upcoming Kombat Pack character. We won't spoil it here, so check it out in the Mortal Kombat 1 Omni-Man gameplay trailer below: 


Omni-Man hits Mortal Kombat 1 as part of the first Kombat Pack on November 9.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in August, a Pokémon Presents revealed that the first part of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet's DLC, collectively known as The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero, would hit the game in September. That has since come and gone, with players eagerly awaiting the second part of this expansion. And now, the official Pokémon Twitter account has revealed The Indigo Disk DLC goes live next month. 


More specifically, The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero Part 2: The Indigo Disk hits Pokémon Scarlet and Violet on December 14. As those keeping up with Game Freak's ninth generation of Pokémon know, The Indigo Disk brings players to Blueberry Academy, which is actually in the Unova region, rather than the Paldea region where Pokémon Scarlet and Violet take place. The Unova region is the setting for Pokémon Black and White, and their sequels, Pokémon Black 2 and White 2.

November 2, 2023
Many players are speculating that The Indigo Disk will, in some way, tease remakes of the fifth generation of Pokémon, as those are next in line for Game Freak's cadence of remaking previously released Pokémon games. With players leaving Paldea to check out an academy in Unova, many predict some hint at potential Pokémon Black and White remakes await trainers. But only time will tell. 
Pokémon Scarlet and Violet: The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero Part 2 – The Indigo Disk hits the games on December 14. The DLC can be purchased as a pack for $34.99. 
For more, read about how after The Indigo Disk is out, every starter Pokémon will be available in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, and then read Game Informer's Pokémon Scarlet and Violet review.

For The King 2, at least, seems pretty trim and digestible at a reported 30 hours in length. Released out of early access today, it's a blend of fantasy table-top gaming and roguelite, in which you lead a party of adventurers across a hexagonal map to quash an evil Queen in grid, dice and turn-based combat.

Horror gaming has witnessed multiple seismic shifts since 1996, most notably the turn to action-oriented design with the likes of The Suffering and Resident Evil 4 in the mid-2000s, as well as the rise of spooky almost-walking-simulators like SOMA in the mid-2010s. 

Yet the term survival horror has expanded to such a degree that it now seems to stand in, albeit rather awkwardly, for the entirety of video game horror. Even with the caveat that borders for these kinds of labels are notoriously hard to define, survival horror remains an unusually amorphous realm, one that (as a quick search of the relevant tag on Steam will reveal) lays claim as much to first-person bloodbaths like Zombie Army Trilogy as it does moody, combat-free adventures like Visage. Still, old distinctions linger, and a clutch of recent indie survival horrors qualify their work with the word “classic”. I interviewed some of the developers to find out why - and, more importantly, what classic survival horror means.

        <updated>2023-11-02T13:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Game Informer can exclusively reveal Assassin's Creed Valhalla: The Hidden Codex, a new graphic novel from Dark Horse Books that brings players back into the world of assassin Eivor, a medieval Nordic land, a new hidden order, and more. It will be released as a hardcover graphic novel on April 30, 2024, in retail stores and online, for $19.99 (and it hits comic book stores on May 1, 2024). Mathieu Gabella is the author, with art from Paolo Traisci. 
The Hidden Codex follows Edward, a scribe and reluctant monk after he escapes from a kidnapping performed by a clan of Vikings. After securing his freedom, Edward finds his brother missing and strange documents "blackened by a language he innately understands." 
"No one knows where these occult-looking symbols came from, but Edward has seen such writings before: in the workshop of an enigmatic wise man among the Vikings who is part of a secret order: Those Unseen," a press release reads. "An order that could offer answers to Edward, and guarantee his aspirations of freedom and knowledge. But with that knowledge, can he find and rescue his own brother before it's too late?"
Ubisoft senior transmedia content manager Etienne Bouvier says the company is lucky to work with Gabella and Traisci as they are two long-standing fans of the Assassin's Creed franchise who infused their love of it, and knowledge of its lore, into this book. 
Assassin's Creed Valhalla: The Hidden Codex hits bookshelves and online retailers on April 30, 2024, before it hits comic book stores on May 1. It is available for preorder now and costs $19.99. 
For more about the series, read Game Informer's Assassin's Creed Valhalla review and then read our Assassin's Creed Mirage review. After that, read Game Informer's ranking of every Assassin's Creed game.

The most significant additions  are accessibility settings for colour-blind people, the ability to visually customise hirelings upon recruitment, and the ability to clean up party members using sponges and soap, rather than lobbing bottles of water at them. No more rocking up to cutscenes looking like Sweeney Todd on his lunchbreak! Well, unless that's your vibe.

Mafia II: Definitive Edition
This remaster of the 2010 crime game spruces up the adventure with improved HD visuals. It also includes all of its post-launch DLC. You can us take a tour of the game in this episode of New Gameplay Today.
Dragon Ball: The Breakers
This 7-v-1 multiplayer game pits a team of random normies, plus Bulma and Oolong, against a player controlling iconic Dragon Ball villains like Frieza, Cell, and Buu. The non-villains must work together to survive and escape stages in a time machine. The villain player’s job is simple: hunt and destroy everyone else. 
Aliens: Fireteam Elite
Up to four-players team up to battle hordes of xenomorphs in this cooperative class-based shooter. In our review, former editor Jason Guisao gave it a 6.5/10, writing, 
As a reminder, you have until November 6 to add October's monthly games to your library.

You get a much bigger screen for the money plus TV functionality, and if you choose carefully you won't give up PC niceties like 4K 120Hz support or  FreeSync and G-Sync compatibility. 
This leads us neatly on to the 42-inch LG C3 OLED, which has dropped to £949 at Currys in the UK for Black Friday (it's normally £1399). This tasty £450 discount brings the monitor down to a price that it actually offers better value than many large-format gaming monitors, while offering far superior HDR, incredible motion clarity and of course full compatibility with PS5 and Series X consoles.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last week on the Electronic Wireless Show podcast, Alice and James use the Frasier-inspired browser RPG as a springboard to talk about The Simpsons a lot. And also fan-made video games, like a weird SpongeBob SquarePants fever dream that James experienced while full of milk and chili, and the Waterworld arcade game (as imagined in The Simpsons). Plus, we talk about games we've been playing recently, which includes Alan Wake 2. Alice does an unhinged rant while unaware she is once again ravaged by Covid.


This is why episode 35 is coming out a week after it was supposed to: yes, I had coronavirus the entire time! Apologies for the delay. But, you know, not like loads, I was pretty sick.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It is perhaps ironic that in attempting to crystalise my thoughts about Alan Wake 2 - a game about a novelist with such crippling writer's block that they end up spawning an entire evil doppelganger of themselves to sabotage their own work - I, too, have been hopelessly staring at a blank screen for the better part of 24 hours. I have not, thank goodness, reached the stage where my psyche's split in two (yet), but this spiral of self-doubt has now got to the point where I simply have put words, any words, in front of one another to write my way out of this hellish pit of despair. 
Alan himself goes through a similar ordeal of writing to escape as he tries to find a way out of the prison-like dimension known as The Dark Place, where he's been trapped since the events of the first game - and I take heart from the fact that it's clearly well-worn territory for the folks at Remedy as well, such is the forensic precision in the way it's portrayed onscreen: a chaotic, supernatural tornado that not only threatens to unravel Alan's own identity, but also the wider world as we know it. It's imposter syndrome writ large, and honestly, Remedy are pretty on the money with this one. Horace is not a pretty taskmaster when the words stop coming.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Thirsty Suitors is a dazzling new entry in a genre that is always badly in need of bolstering: turn-based RPGs without anime aesthetics and a story about something other than killing God. The game sees you play as Jala, who returns to her dilapidated hometown after getting dumped by the older woman for whom she abandoned college and her high school sweetheart. Waiting for her is a disappointed mother, a soon-to-be-wed sister who refuses to even speak to her, and a shadowy cabal formed of her spurned exes from the time in her life when rampant, unrelenting teen horniness nearly ripped the town apart. Jala’s journey to redemption and genuine adulthood will take her to the psychic plane to do cathartic (if overly simplistic) battle with her wronged exes, to the local skatepark to pull off some janky grinds, and to grounded emotional revelations that are rarely written this well in videogames.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Marvel's Spider-Man 2 hit PlayStation 5 exclusively on October 20 and quickly became Sony's fastest-selling first-party game. While we loved the game – read Game Informer's Marvel's Spider-Man 2 review here – players have discovered bugs and issues leading to laughter and, in some cases, progress impediment. Fortunately, developer Insomniac Games has been quick to fix issues with updates, like one last week that fixed an incorrect flag and the infamous white cube model issue. 
Now, the studio has released another update targeting various bugs players might be encountering in the game related to specific missions, shortcuts, tutorials, and more. 


Here's the full Update Version 1.001.004 release notes: 
Addressed an issue where players could become stuck during the finale of Marko's Memories
Addressed an issue where a boss could become stuck in geometry
Addressed multiple issues where the player could become stuck during the Galvanize tutorial
Addressed an issue where players with shortcuts enabled could become stuck in a puzzle during the New Threads mission
Addressed an issue where the Charge Jump would break when assigned to a shortcut
Addressed an issue where the Upgraded Classic suit had duplicate eye details
Further addressed issues where models would not load properly after long play sessions
Improved stability 
Hopefully, if one of these issues has stopped you from progressing past certain points in Marvel's Spider-Man 2's various quests, you'll be able to advance after installing this update. 
For more about the game, read Game Informer's Marvel's Spider-Man 2 review and then read about how Insomniac updated New York City for the sequel. Then check out this story about this missing NYC landmark in the game. After that, read our guide for the best graphics mode in Marvel's Spider-Man 2, and then check out our spoiler-free tips.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gran Turismo 7 is getting its biggest update tomorrow in the form of Spec II (a.k.a update 1.40). The content drop, which is free, adds a new cooperative mode, seven new cars, a fresh track, and more.


Perhaps the update’s biggest addition is four-player local split-screen. Unfortunately for PS4 players, this option is only available on PS5. Speaking of PS5-only features, those players can enjoy taking on Gran Turismo Sophy, which developer Polyphony Digital describes as a “prototype revolutionary racing AI agent” 
Spec II also adds the snowy Lake Louise track. Set in a Canadian ski resort, it comes in three variants: long track, short track, and tri-oval. New Master License events are coming and the update also adds quality-of-life features, such as a dashboard that tracks player progression.
Of course, new vehicles are always exciting, and here are the seven joining the roster:
Dodge Charger R/T 426 Hemi '68
Dodge Challenger SRT Demon '18
Lexus LFA '10
Mercedes-Benz 190 E 2.5-16 Evolution II '91
NISMO 400R '95
Porsche 911 GT3 RS (992) '22
Tesla Model 3 Performance '23
Spec II adds a host of smaller additions, such as new Cafe menus and new photo mode options, and you can read a complete breakdown by reading the blog post on the Gran Turismo website. You can download the update on November 2. For more on Gran Turismo 7, check out our review.]]></summary>

Ever since its first title 20 years ago, the WarioWare franchise has shapeshifted to take advantage of the capabilities and gimmicks of whatever the current Nintendo platform was. But the first entry on Switch, Get It Together, bucked that trend, putting you in control of the actual cast of characters in platforming-style microgames instead of taking advantage of the Switch’s unique traits. WarioWare: Move It aligns more with the traditional WarioWare experience, resulting in a better overall collection.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sega has unveiled Sonic Dream Team, a new 3D action-platformer launching exclusively on December 5 on Apple Arcade. With it launching on Apple Arcade, you'll need to subscribe to the iOS-based gaming subscription service, which costs $6.99 a month. Dr. Eggman has discovered The Reverie, a special ancient device that can manifest dreams in the real world, and it's up to Sonic the Hedgehog and friends to stop him from doing so. Players must navigate "twisted dreamscapes, rescue your friends, and put a stop to Dr. Eggman's nightmarish dreams of world domination." 
Sonic Dream Team features six playable characters in Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, Amy Rose, Cream, and Rouge, and Sega says each character brings their own flair and personality alongside three movement types "that provide unique exploration opportunities while navigating the dream world." It also features four boss battles, never-before-seen worlds spread across "four unique dream worlds with mind-bending environments that include wall-running, gravity changes, and more." Plus, Sonic Dream Team can be played on iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple TV. 
Check out the Sonic Dream Team reveal trailer for yourself below: 


And here are some Sonic Dream Team screenshots too:

Insomniac’s Spider-Man 2 explores a totally new story about the iconic alien parasite, and while many of the game’s plot threads get resolved by the end of the story, there’s still plenty of room for future DLC or a sequel to bring Spider-Man’s beloved foil Venom back for more…

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Beware major plot spoilers for the entire Amnesia series, together with descriptions of fictional torturing techniques.

The most ghoulish of Amnesia's many ghoulish ideas is "vitae". It's a luminous, blue-green fluid that can be used as an energy source, a chemical catalyst and a supernatural healing agent. Each Amnesia game is broadly a story about the production of vitae, with some levels consisting of huge distillation and refining apparata, and major plot developments tied to what you do with it. In the original Amnesia: The Dark Descent, you'll brew potions using vitae in order to keep a decapitated head alive. In 2020's Amnesia: Rebirth, you'll use ornate metal cannisters of the stuff like batteries to power otherworldly machines. Vitae is the blood and breath of Amnesia, the grease upon the narrative axels, the fuel in its boiler, the miracle McGuffin that sustains its nastier flights of fantasy. But what is vitae, exactly? Agony.

After a September patch that included various changes to make the Soulslike action RPG easier, game director Jiwon Choi has released a Director's Letter to confirm plans for a Lies of P sequel, tease DLC for the game with two new images, and more. 
Lies Of P Sequel Confirmed


Choi began the video thanking players for helping the game sell 1 million copies in less than two months after release. He then sneakily drops a line confirming the Pinocchio-inspired Soulslike is getting a sequel. 
"Our highest priority is developing the DLC and working on the sequel," Choi says in the Director's Letter. "The dev team…]]></summary>

Mind you, it appears the associated functionality was secretly part of Bethesda's sci-fi RPG all along, perhaps destined to be unlocked by a DLC pack, like a slumbering fairytale royal awaiting true love's kiss.
The modder in question is vexthecollector, whose catchily-named Spacestations for Outposts lets you bolt together hab modules, windows and docking bays to fashion your very own Deep Space Nine. Sadly for my character, the acutely terra-phobic star pirate Mary Read, you'll need to first build an outpost on a planet in order to access the goods.

And now, just a few days later, the studio has provided some updates to some games it has in development, including Control 2 and its remakes of Max Payne 1 and 2. 


In its latest earnings report for the third quarter of 2023, Remedy says, "Alan Wake 2 launched with great reception, laying the foundation for [the] future," although with the game having just launched, it has nothing to share on the financial performance of the game. However, the studio says, "[We] continue enhancing Alan Wake 2 with new updates and developing the two announced expansions to the game," adding that "Alan Wake 2 marks the f…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Headless enemies aren't exactly a new concept in games, so I'm not sure why the Headless in Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice instills such dread in me. It's so terrifying to face that I almost didn't write this post, because I knew I'd have to drop into its heinous lair in order to take the screenshot you see above.
But I'm a brave boy, so I dropped in, and of course died almost instantly. Sekiro is still one of the toughest soulslikes around, absolutely filled with extremely dangerous bosses and twisted body-horror monstrosities that can carve you up with just a couple of hits, sending you back to the last checkpoint bereft of all your XP. But the Headless scares me so much, I actively avoid facing it until I have absolutely no choice.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jusant is all show, no tell, which is a bold swing. Video game characters aren't often big on show don't tell in 2023. A lot of them have been cursed by their creators to narrate everything they do, as they do it, incase the meatsacks controlling them are unable to parse even one second of what is happening on screen without direction. I love HZD's Aloy, but does she ever just stream-of-consciousness her way through life.
In contrast, the nameless protagonist in Don't Nod's new climbing puzzle adventure (what even are genres?) is also silent. There are no other NPCs. You are climbing up through the ruins of an old civilisation. As such, Jusant relies on the devs having crafted an understandable world that you can barely interact with, aside from painstakingly climbing across it like a spidery archaeologist. You've got to have faith in your environmental storytelling if you're making a game like that. And Don't Nod have nailed it.

Jusant asks players to do one thing: climb. As a silent mountaineer accompanied by a cute critter, the only thing standing between you and your mysterious mission is one very tall mountain. The journey to its summit is treacherous, but thanks to an ingenious climbing system, beautiful art direction, and intriguing world-building, inching toward the top is worth the effort. 
The intuitive climbing mechanics are the star of the show. Pressing the left and right shoulder buttons lets you grip handholds with the correspond…]]></summary>

I know a little about the Yakuza series, having reviewed the 1980s-set Yakuza Zero for this very parish in 2018, and tried a bit of 2019's turn-based battler Yakuza: Like A Dragon. Fast-forward to 2023, and all Yakuza games are now Like A Dragon games, including the forthcoming Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth, which is an... Animal Crossing game, actually? With skateboarding? I'm still getting my head around the existence of a zombie spin-off, Dead Souls, to say nothing of the samurai-era Like A Dragon: Ishin. And then there's the inter-quel Like a Dragon Gaiden, due this November, which seems like a relatively straight-laced delve into the past of original protagonist Kazuma Kiryu. Phew, it's just as well Ed Thorn wrote that guide to the order you should play the Yakuza games in.


It sounds like the developers at Ryu ga Gotoku Studio have a hard time keeping track themselves, especially given the rate at which Sega publish Like A Dragon games. According to studio director Masayoshi Yokoyama, Like A Dragon's creators feel a lot of pressure to get the games done quickly, not just with a view to making money but because as projects that riff so copiously on pop culture, Like A Dragon stories go out of date fast.

And yet! That's a large part of what I enjoy about the new subterranean survival-craft-'em-up The Lord Of The Rings: Return To Moria. It's a slower, more weighty survival game than you might be used to if you're a Valheim or ARK type, for example, and you'll spend a lot of your time in the dark. But what is this, a survival game for elves? No sir. And besides, like I said, it's rather sweet. Cosy, even.

Ahead of the premiere (release? Launch?) of the experimental Silent Hill Ascension tonight, we had a chance to speak with the developer Genvid about the game (TV show? Crowd-directed narrative?) is, what it will mean to the Silent Hill universe, and how much work is going into animating the versions of the narrative that may never be seen.
Calling Ascension a video game is almost a misnomer. There is an interactive element, but you won’t be holding a controller in your hand pushing characters to make decisions in the traditional sense. Instead, viewers will download the Silent Hill Ascension app on mobile devices or PC (there is a PlayStation option, but only for viewing episodes, not participating)…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've only just read Sin's thoughts on Akuma Kira's Lunacid and lo and behold, the PS1-styled, first-person dungeon crawler has now released out of Steam Early Access, to considerable rejoicing. Lunacid is a homage to classic FromSoftware games - no, not that juvenile upstart Dark Souls, but King's Field and Shadow's Tower, which date back to the late 1990s. 


I played one of the King's Field games as a sprog and found it to be an extended cave system full of lava, demons and torment. Lunacid sort of applies the perspective and medieval fantasy combat of that series to a story reminiscent of Demon's Souls - the From-alike that spurred the Japanese studio to international fame - with a world that has been flooded with toxic mist by a "sleeping old one below". Your job, as some unfortunate outcast chucked into a pit, is to journey downward and confront this mysterious creature, using any and all combinations of rapiers, clubs and fireballs. Off you go then.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Toby Fox followed up their 2015 critically acclaimed and fan-favorite 2D RPG Undertale with Deltarune Chapter 1 in 2018. This chapter was the first in what we'd later learn is a five-chapter top-down RPG with puzzles, bullet hell sequences, and Final Fantasy-inspired combat, and Chapter 1 was released for free. Fox dropped Chapter 2 in 2021 in a surprise announcement, and now, players patiently await the release of Chapter 3. Today, more than two years later, Fox has revealed an updated plan for their Deltarune release strategy. 


With Chapter 3 nearing completion, Fox plans to finish Chapter 4 and release Deltarune as a purchaseable product. And following that, development on Chapter 5 will continue and hit the game when it's ready. To help with this, Fox has hired a producer "whose entire job it will be to speed up the overall game development for future chapters," according to a new statement released. 
You can read Fox's full statement below: 
Elsewhere in the update, Fox says Chapter 3 took a lot of trial and error to figure out how it would work but that with Chapter 4, "I already feel very confident about how we can progress." They also note that people on the team are already transitioning back into working on Chapter 4 and that everybody is excited to work on that part of Deltarune. 
For more about the game, watch the original Deltarune teaser and then check out this Chapter 2 teaser. After that, read Game Informer's Undertale review. 
Are you going to purchase Deltarune with the release of Chapter 4? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

These include the modestly-known about Control 2, a sequel to the paranormal Brutalist telekinet 'em up that is seeing "good progress", and the forthcoming remakes of Max Payne 1 and 2, on which Remedy are collaborating with GTA and Max Payne 3 developer Rockstar.
Further afield, there's the mysterious Condor project, a co-op multiplayer Control spin-off (pictured above) that builds on Remedy's experience crafting the single-player component for wayward service-based shooter CrossfireX. And at the very edge of sight, there's the faint outline of something called Codename Vanguard, about which naff-all is known. Could it be that "crazy, huge budget, dark gothic fantasy" Remedy's creative director Sam Lake would like one day to make?

Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora is the next canonical chapter of the Avatar mythos. Set during the one-year gap in Avatar: The Way of Water on the other side of Pandora in a new area called the Western Frontier, players control a Na’vi raised and trained by the Resources Development Administration (RDA) who finds themselves taking the fight to the corporation. That requires, quite literally, getting back to their roots as they reconnect with Eywa while learning what it means to be a Na’vi by ingratiating themselves with the game’s three new clans.

IGN and Bloomberg have learned new information about the layoffs that occurred at Destiny 2 maker Bungie this week, including that roughly 100 employees were laid off from the company. As for why, IGN's sources report that during an employee meeting after the layoffs, Bungie CEO Pete Parsons told staff that the layoffs were due to the underperformance of Destiny 2 over the last year as well as "lower-than-expected preorders" for the upcoming expansion, The Final Shape. 
Employees were reportedly told that Destiny 2 player sentiment had reached an all-time-low and IGN's sources say employees at the studio have attempted to discuss this with Bungie leadership, asking to make the necessary changes, presumably to get player sentiment back up.

If you preorder a digital version of the game, you can play through its campaign early, starting November 2. That's eight days before the full game's release on November 10, which is when its multiplayer suite goes live. Ahead of that early campaign launch, publisher Activision Blizzard has released the PC specs and system requirements to play Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III. 
If you've played recent Call of Duty entries, you likely already know what you're in for, and this year's is not all that different. But if you're new, or curious if you need to upgrade before this year's entry, we've got you covered.

Speaking to me in an interview about Hunt's evolution since its launch out of early access in 2019, the game's general manager David Fifield observed that while Crytek may yet make another Hunt game it won't be a straight Showdown follow-up - and it certainly won't come at the expense of your ability to play the original game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in June, when our Ed got a 30-minute hands-off glimpse of Avatar: Frontiers Of Pandora, he had suspicions that Ubisoft's next big open world-athon was hiding some dark, terrible secret beneath the surface. It was almost too good, and too lovely-looking to be completely true, he proposed, and the brief tour of this rather enormous-looking game wasn't quite long enough to really dig beneath the surface to see if Ubisoft's lofty promises would hold up to closer scrutiny. 
Now, just over a month from release, I've finally been able to put it under a proper microscope, playing two hours of the thing from around the 25% mark of its campaign. And it really is as visually impressive as Ed suggested all those months ago. At long last, this is a game that looks and feels like an actual "next-gen" blockbuster (or as much as a game can, at least, when we're already several years into the current generation cycle). But Ed was also right to feel a wee bit suspicious of Frontiers Of Pandora. Perhaps not in the way he expected, but enough that I heard the same thing being muttered over and over again by almost everyone at the end of my preview session at Ubisoft's UK offices: "I can't work out where the heck I'm meant to be going, or what I'm supposed to do."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Square Enix revealed Kingdom Hearts Missing-Link, a new GPS-based action RPG for iOS and Android devices, last year as part of its 20th Anniversary celebration, which is also where the company revealed Kingdom Hearts IV. Now, Square Enix has released a new teaser trailer for Missing-Link alongside the reveal it will launch sometime next year. 
In the teaser trailer, we see someone who is presumably the game's protagonist in Scala ad Caelum, a special metropolis that those who have completed Kingdom Hearts III will recognize. The teaser showcases the RPG's combat as well, which seems like a mix between some of the mechanics in Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories and standard mobile action RPG gameplay. We also see some of the Disney characters in the game, including Ariel from The Little Mermaid, Simba from The Lion King, and Baymax from Big Hero 6, to name a few. 
Check out the Kingdom Hearts Missing-Link teaser trailer for yourself below: 


Square Enix says it is now recruiting testers from the U.K. and Australia for a closed Missing-Link beta test, and if eligible, you can apply here.
Kingdom Hearts Missing-Link is due out on iOS and Android in 2024. 
For more, watch the original Missing-Link reveal trailer and then watch the Kingdom Hearts IV reveal trailer. Check out this Sora Amiibo coming out next year after that.

I, of the RPS Treehouse, do truly love Starfield, and have only been quiet about it because admitting you enjoy The Grey Bethesda Game but couldn’t get into Baldur's Gate 3 or Elden Ring feels a bit like going to the Savoy Grill and only ordering chips. No one will ask you to leave, but they’ll probably start questioning your judgement.
But dammit, I like chips, and I like Starfield! I like its roving space captain fantasy, I like its utilitarian aesthetic, and I like how its click-clacking guns sound like extremely violent mechanical keyboards. Especially if I get to fire them at floating pirates, while I’m also floating, and said firing punts me upwards into a ceiling.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some people sing the praises of "visceral" games. Others extol the virtues of "immersive" games. Me, I'm increasingly drawn to "perverse" games. No, not like that. Well, not entirely like that. I mean "perverse" more straightforwardly as in deliberately awkward and unreceptive in their core design, almost self-defeating in a way that has you saying "WTF?" and hankering to know more.
Take The Great Below, a new horror... thingmabob from Cantabria-based Dobra Studios. It's about exploring a strange house full of dreadful paintings in the dark. It's a 3D game with keyboard move-look controls, but the twist is that you can only move around while looking at a 2D map, with your position marked as a pair of footprints.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When was the last time you played a good 3D character platformer? For me, it was probably Psychonauts 2. But before that? Outside of Mario? I'm not sure I'd be able to tell you. For whatever reason, the 3D character platformer has become an increasingly rare breed, it would seem, which makes them even more heartening to see when they do occasionally poke their head above the parapet and leap onto our screens. Song Of Nunu: A League Of Legends Story is one of them, channelling the joyous, boundless enthusiasm of its late 90s and early 00s predecessors to create a simple, but straightforward adventure that you could just as easily enjoy alone as an adult, or with a child in tow. It did not, alas, quite make me cry as developers Tequila Works intended (that honour still belongs to Rime and Rime alone out of their back catalogue), but there's much to admire here while having your heartstrings lightly plucked at the same time. And you don't need to know a jot about League Of Legends to enjoy it.

        <updated>2023-10-27T22:35:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since Insomanic revealed its Wolverine game two years ago, fans have wondered if it’s set in the same universe as the studio’s Spider-Man games. In an interview with Kinda Funny, Spider-Man 2 director Bryan Intihar confirmed the answer is yes
When host Greg Miller asked if it had been previously confirmed or denied whether or not their spin on Wolverine shared the same Earth as its Spider-Men, Intihar replied by saying, “They’re all 1048. I think I got that right, but yeah.” Inthiar is referring to Earth-1048, which is the designation for the Marvel universe Insonmiac’s superhero games occupy.
You can watch the clip beginning at the 1:10:44 mark (thanks IGN). 


Whether or not that means we’ll see any Spider-Man references in Wolverine, which does not have a release window, remains to be seen, but that’s exciting news regardless. Marvel’s Spider-Man’s New York City is chock full of references to other heroes, such as Avengers Tower, the Sanctum Sanctorum, and the Wakandan Embassy, so it made more sense to imagine Logan doing his thing somewhere out there.
Beyond this update, we know little about Wolverine other than that it will be a mature-rated title exclusive to the PlayStation 5. As we wait to learn more details, you can read this opinion piece on why I'd like to see the two game series share the same universe.]]></summary>

A target appears on your back when you’re a long-reigning champ. No longer the enigma you once were, contenders begin studying your body of work to figure out the path to ending your time at the top. The best way to fend off would-be challengers is to continually build and evolve. Developer EA Vancouver seems to understand this because while no legitimate contenders have emerged in the mixed-martial-arts genre, EA Sports UFC 5 retools several key areas to show the franchise isn’t resting on its laurels.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new gameplay video for Little Nightmares III offers a lengthy look at its two-player cooperative gameplay. Like the previous games, this third outing looks every bit as moody and unsettling. 
This pre-alpha footage shows playable characters, Low and Alone, exploring The Necropolis, a desert-like zone, working together to overcome its many obstacles. For example, when attacked by flying beetles, one shoots them down with a bow while the other smashes the downed targets with a wrench. The kids’ biggest threat, at least in this slice, comes in the form of a giant, rampaging doll aptly known as "Monster Baby". It’s supremely creepy, and you can see for yourself below.


Unlike the first two games, which were developed by Tarsier Studios, Little Nightmares III is being made by Supermassive Games, makers of Until Dawn and The Dark Pictures Anthology. It’s scheduled to launch next year for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you love The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker but wish it had more blood, death and inclement weather in it, consider Sands of Aura. Released out of early access today, this is a top-down fantasy action-RPG set in a swirling, post-apocalyptic world in which you build up a town and sail between island dungeons in a sandship.
The sandship, or rather, "grainwake" sailing sees you bouncing merrily from dunes as vast, ominous structures loom out of the haze. The combat takes some inspiration from the Souls games, but the top-down perspective makes it feel like a classic arcade action title. Boss battles involve dodging or parrying colourful streaks, waves and clusters of projectiles. The developers, 12-person Chashu Entertainment, say it's a difficult experience. It looks it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the last year or so, it seems Apple has come to realize the devices it is putting in everyone's pockets are actually quite powerful and can do a whole lot more than just browse the internet and send text messages. Playing video games on a phone is familiar practice, but with the release of iPhone 15, Apple is making a push to compete with the likes of PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X. This is why games like Death Stranding and Resident Evil Village are making their way to the newest iOS device, the latter of which releases October 30.
In honor of that looming release, Marcus joined me for a look at the game on this new platform. It's difficult to show exactly what Resident Evil Village looks on iPhone 15. The screen looks sharper and the framerate is higher than I am able to capture, but we do our best to offer at least a small taste. To ruin the thesis of the video a bit, the conclusion is that Resident Evil Village on iPhone 15 looks good and plays well! As long as you are playing with a controller. The touch-controls render the game nearly unplayable. The U.I. is supremely distracting and Resident Evil Village was not built with the touch controls in mind, and it shows. But if you have a Backbone controller or a Bluetooth controller (like a PS4 or PS5 controller) than you will be in good shape to fight werewolves and Lady Dimitrescu on a handheld platform.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After spending hours poring over Alan Wake 2 this week, corkboards full of photos, red string and important little clue nuggets have definitely been on my brain. Alas, Remedy's horror-fuelled detective 'em up keeps its problem-solving a little too much at arm's length for my tastes. Every piece of evidence you collect has its own set place on the board, for example, and heck, even the thrill of joining the dots with a set of pins and string is taken away from you, as its deduction work is all swept up in a wave of automation. 
Happily, other developers are stepping in to fill that string-based gap, and chief among them is the French-made Chronique Des Silencieux, whose Steam demo I played over lunch today. You play as a rookie detective in this charming point and click game, and your entire raison d'etre is to point out contradictions Phoenix Wright-style between testimonies you gather and the evidence you accumulate. Only instead of shouting, "Objection!" you do it by manually sticking pins and red string between the offending bits of information. It's delightful, and well worth a nose if old Alan leaves you wanting this weekend.

RE Engine's successor, the REX engine, is a response to three things - 1) RE Engine productions getting bigger in terms of assets, and more diverse in terms of genre, 2) RE Engine games being increasingly made by overseas developers who speak different languages, and 3) unflattering comparisons with various commercial tools, like Unreal Engine and Unity.

In Free Range Games's plucky dungeon sim The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria, you're a dwarf trying to reclaim the once-proud undercity of Khazad-dûm, tunnelling between procedurally generated networks of halls and crafting your own havens and upgrade facilities from long-wrecked forges and mansions. 


 The game is set after Sauron's defeat at the end of The Return of the King novel (spoilers, I guess?), at a time in Middle-earth canon when most of the big names were busy shaking hands and doling out promotions, but there are still plenty of orcs, trolls and other threats to worry about in Moria. Right now, though, the real headache is that I can't make my base of operations symmetrical.

The sheer cheek of it! Honestly, I'm still mildly shocked by it all. Just the thought of all that brilliant music, available to everyone, for zero pence and import fees. What an outstanding gift to the world. (Well, the real gift would be re-printing the fabled Final Fantasy X-2 Piano Collections CD and/or sticking that online as well, if you ask me, but hey, I'll allow them this one little omission). 
After all, there's an absolute treasure trove of music you lucky lot get to dig into now, so if you're wondering where to start or just fancy yet another guided tour through some of Final Fantasy's best music tracks, allow me to forcibly volunteer myself to regale you with some of my personal favourite highlights.

A widely-shared reddit post suggests that rendering the highly detailed chompers of Skylines 2’s citizenry, who lack the LOD (level of detail) implementation that would reduce their model quality at a distance, is a major cause behind the game’s inability to pump out frames per second. Developers Colossal Order disagree, and have put out a statement denying this "bizarre story."

With Fortnite loading screens hiding secret dates that point to Chapter 1: Season 5 and props from that season landing on this current season's map, players have remain convinced that the next season, Chapter 4: Season 5 will actually bring everyone back to an older chapter of Fortnite; now we know it's happening. 
Today's reveal comes by way of the official Fortnite Twitter account, which posted, "Sprint (or Mantle, your choice) back to Chapter 1...see you soon 11.3.2023 #FortniteOG" with an image of the Fortnite battle bus.

As you can see, the above Tweet confirms what many have been speculating: Fortnite is going back to its Chapter 1 roots. And while not officially confirmed, it's likely the Chapter 4: Season 5 map will have some Chapter 1: Season 5 integration on it based on teases over the past few weeks. 
Fortnite Chapter 4: Season 5 launches November 3.

Then, earlier this month, Atari revealed Berzerk: Recharged, the first Berzerk game since the original 1980s arcade game. At the time, the company said it was coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC, and now we know exactly when: November 9. 
"On November 9, Evil Otto once again invites you to his maze of maniacal chaos in the newly reimagined Berzerk: Recharged," an Atari press release reads. "The latest entry in Atari's acclaimed Recharged series, Berzerk: Recharged will have you almost begging for mercy as you face off against Otto's droves of robotic menaces, all while the grinning incarnation of evil draws ever nearer." 
Alongside this release date news, Atari has released some additional Berzerk: Recharged screenshots you can check out below:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yesterday was a great day for fans of the most emo Batman in the Caped Crusader's cinematic history because Robert Pattinson's suit from The Batman was seemingly added to Batman: Arkham Knight. But the fun was fleeting because just a few hours later, the suit was removed.
Strangely, the suit, which first appeared in director Matt Reeve's 2022 The Batman, was only available in the Epic Games Store version of Arkham Knight, as noticed by GeekVibesNation on Twitter and verified by GameSpot; Game Informer was not able to check the game for the suit before it was removed.

At first, fans thought the suit was a well-made mod making the rounds online before more and more people realized it was actually added. As for why it was added, nobody knows, but Game Informer reached out to Warner Bros. Games to ask about the suit and will update this story if we learn more. 
The Batman suit joins a plethora of other movie suits already in Arkham Knight, like Michael Keaton's from the 1989 film, Batman, or Christian Bale's from The Dark Knight. Here's hoping The Batman suit returns soon because if screenshots players have captured are any indication, it fits right in with the dark Gotham of Arkham Knight. 
While we all wait to learn more, read Game Informer's reviews of Arkham Asylum, Arkham City, and Arkham Knight. After that, read Game Informer's Batman: Arkham Origins review, which is a game that just celebrated its 10-year anniversary this week.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You can probably guess what’s coming. Alan Wake 2’s PC performance has been the subject of nervous uh oh-ing since well before the release of its onerous system requirements; Remedy comms director Thomas Puha even implored players to "look at the image quality" instead of framerates, like Dean Learner exalting the storytelling of Punch of Judy.
Actually, that’s not fair. Alan Wake 2 is much more enjoyable than Punch and Judy. And, like Remedyverse predecessor Control, there is something impressive about just how much visual tech you can choose to put on show: ray tracing, path tracing, Nvidia Ray Reconstruction, frame generation via DLSS 3, the lot. This wealth of options has produced the most intricate settings guides I’ve put together in ages, and you can consult it yourself lower down this page.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Crytek's Hunt: Showdown may yet receive a single-player campaign, if the stars align, as the developers dig ever deeper into the asymmetrical multiplayer shooter's wonderfully plague-ridden narrative backdrop. Originally released out of Steam and Xbox early access in 2019, the game introduced single player PvE trials back in June 2020, much to Alice0's enthusiasm. It also now sports a scripted, voiced tutorial in which you stalk around farmhouses, learning the ropes and murdering wooden dummies at the behest of a leathery dude in the bushes. Could some kind of proper story component follow? Crytek have certainly thought about it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You haven't even downloaded Remedy's Alan Wake 2 yet, assuming you're planning to, which means it's already time to start thinking about what you'll do once you've finished it. Apologies, the news beat is a cruel mistress and the present is always past, but in my defence, jumping irresponsibly around the timeline does make sense for a supernatural horror game that follows two characters through different dimensions.
Remedy's plans for the game include a chunky New Game+ mode, aka "Final Draft", which will hopefully arrive in late November, and two DLC packs, Night Springs and The Lake House. The first concerns Alan Wake's fictional in-game TV show, a homage to the Twilight Zone, while the second involves "an independent government organization" that can surely only be the Federal Bureau of Control.

As is the case with any cult game, new fans have been discovering it in the years since, and a recent remaster means many more have likely played the game recently. For those who played it when it came out, however, jumping into Alan Wake 2 can be confusing. The list below outlines a handful of characters worth remembering before diving into the ocean that’s not a lake.
I fully acknowledge that simply being reminded of a character with the knowledge that they will be relevant to the sequel could be conceived as a spoiler. Some of the characters below appear in person, some only in passing in documents, but they are the ones that forced me to pause the game and do a quick Google. No major story elements of Alan Wake 2 are spoiled,…]]></summary>

If that sounds like you, you're in the right place; here's everything you need to know about the first Alan Wake to prepare for the sequel.
Arriving at Bright Falls
The game takes place in the town of Bright Falls, Washington, where the titular protagonist Alan Wake is going on vacation with his wife, Alice.

Recently tipped to appear in early fiscal year 2023-2024, it's now due to make landfall in the publisher's FYQ4 - sometime between January and March 2024. What's the Golden Age of Piracy equivalent for "vapourware"? I'm picturing a spectral vessel like the Flying Dutchman, crewed by glum-faced producers and with a big grimacing statue of company CEO Yves Guillemot affixed to the prow.


The troubled naval combat sim isn't the only Ubisoft project experiencing misadventures. As revealed in their latest earnings report, the publisher have also pushed back a mysterious "large game", originally due to launch before the end of their current fiscal year, to the next fiscal year, which means at some point after 31st March 2024. Speculation runs rife that the anonymous blockbuster is Ubisoft Massive's Star Wars Outlaws.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Marvel's Spider-Man 2 hit PlayStation 5 exclusively last week and it's already Sony's fastest-selling first-party game. While we loved the game – read Game Informer's Marvel's Spider-Man 2 here – once players got their hands on the game, some encountered a few bugs and issues, like one where their character model became a small white cube that looks like tofu. Plus, players discovered a Cuban flag was displayed inside and outside the Morales household rather than the expected Puerto Rican flag. A new update for Marvel's Spider-Man 2 out today fixes both of these issues and more. 


Version 1.001.003 is now live in-game, and it brings a few fixes to the game, including the aforementioned flag issue and white cube issue. It also addresses an issue where The Amazing 2 Suit's spider logo appeared too bright in-game, and improves the game's stability. Here's the full update breakdown: 
Addressed an issue where an incorrect flag was displayed
Addressed an issue where models would not load properly after long play sessions
Addressed an issue where The Amazing 2 Suit's Spider logo appeared too bright
Improved stability
Developer Insomniac Games has also released a statement alongside the above patch notes specifically addressing the flag issue. 
"Today's patch corrects an error where the Cuban flag was incorrectly displayed instead of the Puerto Rican flag," it reads. "We understand that accurate representation matters, and greatly regret this error. We sincerely apologize and will do better in the future." 


Marvel's Spider-Man 2 hit PlayStation 5 exclusively on October 20.

Its release this week comes after developer Remedy Entertainment delayed the game 10 days earlier this summer. While there are plenty of visual options for players playing on PC – check out Alan Wake 2's PC spec requirements here – there are only two graphics modes for those picking it up on PS5 and Xbox Series X (and just one on Xbox Series S). But first, be sure to read Game Informer's Alan Wake 2 review.  
Below, we'll dive into the two graphics modes for Alan Wake 2 on PS5 and Xbox Series X, and then a handful of Game Informer editors playing the game will share the mode they've opted to experience Remedy's latest in.

Remedy is known for being experimental. It mixes live-action footage into its video games, plays with player expectations, rewards those devoted to the developer’s history and gameography, and in the case of Alan Wake 2, eagerly performs big-budget lunacy for our entertainment and sometimes confusion. The highs of Alan Wake’s follow-up adventure are tall, but there are frequent lows that drag the whole experience into The Dark Place.

It didn't quite land for us – Game Informer gave it a 6 out of 10 – but a new update that launches later today fixes one of the major problems we had with the soulslike. That's because the new Pumpkin Patch update that launches at 2 p.m. PT/5 p.m. ET today comes with reduced enemy density. Plus, the patch brings full crossplay to the game alongside performance and stability fixes and more. 
The Pumpkin Patch update also brings a special in-game Halloween celebration to the setting of Mournstead that starts today and ends November 2.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this week, Microsoft revealed the launch of Starfield led to a 13% increase in overall Xbox content and services revenue in its Fiscal Year 2024 Quarter 1 financials. Now, Capcom has released its latest round of financials – the six-month period that ended in September – and in it, reveals that both income and profit are up thanks to the excellent launches of its Resident Evil 4 remake and Street Fighter 6. 
Total game sales are up from 21.3 million this time last year to 22.6 million units, resulting in a net sales increase of 53%, from 49,067 million Yen to 74,934 million Yen. Operating income is up 55%, too. As for why, Capcom points to the release of its Resident Evil 4 remake, which it released back in March, Street Fighter 6, which hits PlayStation, Xbox, and PC in June, and its Monster Hunter series. 


Resident Evil 4 has sold 5.45 million units, while Street Fighter 6 is at 2.47 million units sold. Monster Hunter Rise, with its Sunbreak expansion, has crossed 6.5 million units sold. Capcom has also revealed that its remake of Resident Evil 2 has sold more than 13 million units, with its remake of Resident Evil 3 sitting at 8 million units sold. The recently released Monster Hunter Now, a Monster Hunter take on Pokemon Go, has been downloaded more than 10 million times by players as of last week. 
Capcom says the entire Resident Evil series has sold more than 150 million units, with Monster Hunter crossing 95 million. The Street Fighter franchise sits at 52 million. Here are some other series highlights: 
Mega Man: 41 million units sold
Devil May Cry: 30 million units sold
Dragon's Dogma: 7.9 million
