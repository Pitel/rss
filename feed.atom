        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The best Kingdom Hearts characters have a ton of personality, have been through hardship, or simply have powerful abilities that dynamically elevate the series' battle scenes. A key element why Kingdom Hearts resonates with so many people is not just the non-stop action; but the passion behind the cast's motivations.


Characters like Sora and Roxas aren't afraid to express their emotions: to cry, to scream, to love, to smile. And many of the legendary series characters are more intriguing than the average RPG cast, and it's refreshing to see heroes, (or in some rare cases, villains), that we are able to relate to.


Warning: There are spoilers for Kingdom Hearts 2, Kingdom Hearts 3, and Kingdom Hearts 3: Remind in this list.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Another Pro Open Mystery Nation objective is now live in EA FC 25, and you can complete it to earn a bonus reward.


This is the eighth instance of the objective, which have been released previously by EA Sports. The task is simple, and all you have to do is to use a card from the selected nation in any game mode to unlock the rewards. However, you'll have to figure out what's the correct nation before you can complete the task.


Disclaimer: Mystery Nation has been solved. 


EA FC 25 Pro Open Mystery Nation objective guide


The Pro Open Mystery Nation objective has only one task, and here's the official description.



Score three goals using a Finesse Shot with a player from the mystery nation in any UT game mode. The name of the nation will be hinted at during the broadcast of FC Pro Open Matchday 8.




To complete the task, just use any card from the mystery nation, and you can complete the task in any Ultimate Team game mode. That makes your job easier, as you can simply play friendlies with your buddy to unlock the reward. 


Make sure that you're using the correct type of shots to complete the task, and it can be finished in one game. However, it's not necessary to complete the task in one match, and you can utilize multiple games. 


The last seven weeks have taken us on world tour as the previous mystery nations have represented all the continents. It will be interesting to find out what's the correct nation for Matchday 8. The nation will be gradually revealed on the stream by EA Sports as they will drop different hints. 


The latest mystery nation in Ultimate Team is Ecuador. You'll need to use any item from the nation to score three goals with a finesse shot.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Smell of the game.
Since Guilty Gear first arrived on Sony’s PlayStation in 1998, singeing the air with furious guitar shredding, it’s always been a head turner. While graphically, its goth-rock anime stylings have dazzled with each iteration, Arc System Works’ foremost achievement is in managing to differentiate itself from Capcom’s heavily aped fighting game paradigm. That said, with the series becoming so increasingly convoluted over the last 26 years, ostracising many a would-be player as a result, a redress of sorts was needed. It's here that Guilty Gear Strive steps in.
Strive remains tonally as it ever was: all-leather and metal; characters that sit somewhere between glam rock and BDSM fetishists; and a blaze of raucous, revved, spectacular battling. Where Guilty Gear XRD (2014) more closely resembled its predecessors, Strive totally overhauls its character models to be larger and more detailed, from muscle ripples to flailing buckles, and introduces new features while removing some others.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Green Hell developer Creepy Jar announced today that its upcoming sci-fi base-builder StarRupture will be released into Early Access in Fall 2025. To celebrate the announcement, Creepy Jar also released an extended gameplay release trailer showcasing the gunplay, building, and exploring players will be able to do this Autumn.




Set in the year 2021, StarRupture puts players into the role of a corporate prisoner exiled to a deceptively vibrant planet ruled by a merciless star, Ruptura. The star inevitably obliterates all surface life in a fiery doom, resulting in cycles of new life and fauna being formed. It's up to you to harvest resources between each cycle to send back to your corpo-overlords while trying to survive the planet's deadly landscape.


As players survive the hostile ecosystem, they'll build a dynamic base and construct sprawling factories to process the planet's precious resources, unlock new tech, and fortify against the swarms of aggressive alien creatures. You can also uncover clues from prior expeditions, explore abandoned camps, discover cryptic logs, and learn more about the deeper narrative of what's really going on here on the surface of this harsh planet.


I'm a fan of Green Hell as well as pretty much anything sci-fi, so I'm really interested in seeing what Creepy Jar has cooked up with this one. Based on the trailer, it looks like a nice blend of actual gunplay against the aliens while also building up your base and setting up factories. Usually, games focus too much on one or the other which I think is a missed opportunity. Also, I tend to enjoy co-oping this types of games with a friend or two, so having the option to squad up to 4 players total or jumping in solo is an appealing feature.


If you're interested in trying to survive the fiery wrath of Ruptura, StarRupture ignites into Steam Early Access this Fall via Steam.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Pedri TOTY Honorable Mentions SBC is now live in EA FC 25, and you can complete the challenge to unlock a special card for your Ultimate Team squad.


To play with the item, you'll have to complete all the tasks of the SBC set before it expires. Let's take a look at how to complete the challenge without breaking the bank. 


EA FC 25 Pedri TOTY Honorable Mentions SBC tasks


The Pedri TOTY Honorable Mentions SBC has four different tasks, and here are the conditions.


Task 1 - FC Barcelona



Min. 1 Players from: FC Barcelona


Min. Team Rating: 85



Task 2 - Spain



Min. 1 Players from: Spain


Min. Team Rating: 86



Task 3 - LaLiga



Min. 1 Players from: LALIGA EA SPORTS


Min. Team Rating: 87



Task 4 - 88-Rated Squad



Min. Team Rating: 88



EA FC 25 Pedri TOTY Honorable Mentions SBC solutions


Here's a set of solution to complete to unlock the new Pedri item in EA FC 25. 


Task 1 - FC Barcelona



Any 10 85-rated items


Raphinha 84



Task 2 - Spain



Osimhen 87


Palacios 84


de Jong 87


Nagasato 83


Huth 85


Sinclair 83


Popp 87


Hernandez 83


Laporte 83


Bruno Fernandes 87


Marquinhos 87



Task 3 - LaLiga



Walti RTTK 88


Tillman Winter Wildcards 88


Osimhen 87


Savinho 82


Lukaku 82


Caicedo 82


Saka 87


Pajor 87


Karchaoui 87


Popp 87


Lewandowski 88



Task 4 - 88-Rated Squad



Osimhen 87


Mead 88


Ruben Dias 88


Rice 87


Lavelle 87


Hegerberg 89


Odegaard 89


Fernandes 87


Marquinhos 87


Griezmann 88


Gundogan 87



While the pricing of the SBC is alright, Pedri's Honorable Mentions item could have been better. It offers Incisive Pass+, along with a lot of passing playstyles. However, the Defense (85) and Physicality (86) could have been far better than what it is.


That said, the SBC has just four tasks, and it's cheap. With a bit of boost, the card could do well in competitive matches.

I enjoy feeling the weight of those distant peaks upon my brain and eyeballs, but it's nice to fire up Kingdoms, the new free DD2 game mode that's launched just today, and have a choice of disasters to trundle toward.  


Over here is an inn being overrun by slathering beastmen. Over there is another, safer inn, but it's inconveniently perched behind a nest of tentacular cultists. In the middle there is you, with the customary DD party of half-dead, half-mad adventurers, equipped with an exciting smorgasbord of sharp edges, cursed artefacts, phobias and diseases. Let us proceed laughing and wailing to the launch trailer.

Eggplant Puffs Disney Dreamlight Valley ingredients


To create the tasty Eggplant Puffs for your friends in Disney Dreamlight Valley, you'll need the following three ingredients:



Eggs


Cheese


Eggplant



Screenshot by Destructoid


Honestly, this is one of the easiest dishes to make in the game. Both Eggs and Cheese can be purchased at Chez Remy after completing the rat's quests in the Ratatouille realm in the Castle. Cheese is 220 Star Coins, while Eggs are 180. 


Eggplant seeds are available at Goofy's Stall in the Frosted Heights, which is admittedly quite difficult to reach if you don't have the Dreamlight. You can rack that number up by completing duties and finishing quests from characters along the way. You can also craft Dreamlight by finding Dream Shards in the ground. 


Back on the topic, however; Eggplant seeds are 95 Star Coins, but if you're lucky (and you don't want to wait), the ingredient itself might be available for 462 Star Coins. 


What is this meal worth?


Once you've gained all the ingredients, go to any cooking station like Chez Remy. Add the Eggs, Cheese, and Eggplant into the pot. You should have the Eggplant Puffs ready to go. They might be the flattest texture you can find in the game, but hey, they can be consumed for 1,941 Energy or sold for 991 Star Coins at Goofy's Stalls. You can also make Ratatouille with Eggplant and other ingredients.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Assassin's Creed publishers Ubisoft are making another round of layoffs as part of wider efforts to persuade their investors to stop yelling at them. They're letting 185 people go across their European operations, and will be closing UK-based Ubisoft Leamington, whose recent projects include supporting development of Star Wars Outlaws and Skull And Bones. All this less than two months after jettisoning the hundreds of people who worked on free-to-play shooter XDefiant.

Space Engineers 2 launches into the starry depths of early access today, although it is currently limited to a single player creative mode. It's the sequel to the sci-fi shipbuilding game we quite enjoyed here at RPS. At this early alpha stage, the not-yet-a-survival-game invites players to create galleons of the galaxy, block by shiny metal block, and then drive those ships into one another at 300 metres per second.

It's a fertilized duck egg, boiled or steamed, in which you can still see the duck embryo as you munch.

Which is where first-person Filipino suspense game Hapunan can be found. You play a young street food vendor hawking the eggs on a quiet corner late at night. Naturally, something alarming is afoot.

First, there was Dynasty Warriors: Origins, which I enjoyed quite a bit. Then Ninja Gaiden 2 Black got a surprise release. Now, we're getting Team Ninja's Rise Of The Ronin this coming March - the 11th to be precise. I'd do a bit about stealth drops but I'm at the point where using game-thematic verbs makes me want to collapse on a bed of caltrops, throat first. Here's a trailer:

Years of leaks and rumours made Nintendo's official Switch 2 reveal feel more like a confirmation of what we already knew than a showcase full of surprises. That said, there was so much chatter out there before the reveal that there's still plenty of room for speculation, particularly when it comes to the patents that appeared in the run-up to Nintendo's trailer drop.
Here to provide the technical rundown of it all are the experts over at Digital Foundry. The tech wizards recently dug into a patent suggesting that Switch 2 will utilise 4K AI upscaling technology, explaining what it could mean for the console and how Nintendo might put it into practice.

It uses its open world to tell a story told through manga-like cutscenes. According to the store page, you will “Step into the shoes of a foreigner determined to make his mark on the Japanese drifting scene.”


I played the prologue demo, and, from what I can tell, it wasn’t really about that. You played as some jerk rich kid who was going around and being a privileged jerk.

It's a single-button affair, having you navigate levels by alternating a pivot-point on a shape I don't know the name of so I'm just going to call a spinny stick.
There are moving background elements in some stages - in others, you make your own pace. Except I can't really make my own pace, can I Bauhaus Bonk? Because the swing soundtrack makes me feel like a plodding buffoon if I'm not responding with appropriate gusto. This is entrapment, game.

After releasing the first Tails of Iron in 2021, developer Odd Bug Studio seemingly hasn’t taken a moment to rest, returning to its bleak world of anthropomorphic rats, frogs, and bats with a sequel that looks to offer fans a slightly expanded experience in Tails of Iron 2: Whiskers of Winter. And while it’s certainly an incredibly well-realised fantasy world with stunning visuals, atmospheric sound design, and thoughtful combat, it’s unfortunately also held back from greatness by lacklustre level design and excessive backtracking.
Presenting what may well be a good entry point to the world of Tails of Iron if you happened to miss out on the original, Whiskers of Winter shifts the perspective over to an entirely new protagonist called Arlo, an heir to the Warden of the Wastes who must travel to multiple biomes on a quest to defeat the malicious Dark Wings clan.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft has confirmed that the Japanese version of Assassin's Creed Shadows will be censored in some areas to comply with the regional rating organization CERO. The game initially received a "Z" rating from CERO, which ensured that it would have been illegal to sell the game to anyone under the age of 18.

Assassin's Creed Shadows Japan censorship explained


In a statement translated on X, Ubisoft claims that "there are some differences in the in-game content of the version sold in Japan in order to comply with the regulations of the reviewing organization," referring to CERO. 


"The option to switch dismemberment on and off has been removed from the game settings, and now dismembering the heads and limbs of enemies while playing is permanently disabled. The way severed body parts are depicted has also been changed." This will be a huge disappointment to players in Japan who were looking forward to this element of the game, although the rest of the world remains unaffected, with the option to toggle dismemberment intact.




That's not all, though. Interestingly, "the representation of some Japanese voices played in the overseas versions (North America and Europe) has been changed." Ubisoft was light on details regarding this, so it remains to be seen what has specifically changed here. 


Assassin's Creed Shadows finally takes the long-running series to feudal Japan, arguably one of the most requested periods since the series' inception. On the surface, the two seem to be a match made in heaven, returning back to the RPG formula after the back-to-basics approach of the previous game, Assassin's Creed Mirage.


The road to Shadows has been fraught with controversy, namely multiple delays that have halted the hype somewhat. Still, hands-on previews of Assassin's Creed Shadows have been largely positive, offering hope that Ubisoft may have stuck the landing on this one.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The journey of Yoshifumi Tozuka's Undead Unluck manga has officially reached its conclusion with the release of Chapter 239. The series was serialized in Shueisha's Weekly Shonen Jump magazine, though the digital English version was simultaneously released on MANGA Plus and VIZ Media. With this ending, it joins the long-running titles My Hero Academia and Jujutsu Kaisen in the recently concluded list.


Undead Unluck first saw the light as a one-shot manga in January 2019, before officially becoming a serialized title a year later. The series quickly gained a strong following for its quirky blend of humor, action, and intriguing premise. With over 200 chapters, the manga was collected into 24 tankobon volumes as of January 2025, with the final chapters yet to be accounted for.


The series also received an anime adaptation in 2023. It was a two-cour season with a total of 24 episodes. The pilot episode aired on October 2023 and the final episode released on March 2024.

What is Undead Unluck manga about?


The story follows Fuuko Izumo, a girl whose Unluck curse brings misfortune to anyone she touches. This curse brought her to the lowest of low, causing her to attempt to take her own life. It was during the said attempt that she met Andy, who bore the Undead curse. As the curse's name suggested, Andy couldn't meet his demise no matter what he tried. After centuries of living, he started to search for ways to finally put an end to his life. 


Despite his years of futile attempts, he finally found a glimmer of home during his fateful meeting with Fuuko. After getting a taste of her Unluck, he realized she was his best chance of achieving his goal. Since Fuuko's curse worsened the stronger her feelings toward her target became, Andy now aimed to make her fall in love with him and bring out the worst Unluck she could possibly manifest.

As you level up your Crafting skill, you gain access to the ability to create better gear. A specific Crafting level is also a requirement for tons of quests in Old School RuneScape, the highest of which is 70 for Monkey Madness II. 


Sometimes, if you're just a few levels away from a particular requirement but don't want to actually grind for it, there are Crafting boosts you can use to push you over the boundary, albeit temporarily.

As Nintendo continues to take its good old time revealing details about its upcoming console, other companies have been quick to cash in on everyone's desperation for Switch 2 news. The price point is a key talking point right now and Italian site Games And Movies has taken a punt and put limited Switch pre-orders live for 364,99€.
The retail site doesn't put a date on the launch, instead carrying the 31st December 2025 placeholder, but it's the price point that has caught people's attention. 365€ puts the console at just 15€ more than the Switch OLED's RRP - the price you pay if you get the current model from Nintendo itself.

One of the biggest surprises of 2024 was undoubtedly Black Myth: Wukong, an action RPG from Chinese developer Game Science. Though not necessarily regarded as one of the all-time greats, it was certainly well-received and went on to sell an extraordinary amount of copies within a very short timeframe; reportedly over 18 million in just two weeks.
Naturally, then, this means that some sort of knock-off has inevitably appeared on the Nintendo Switch eShop, though the exceedingly blatant nature of this one has made it necessary for us to at least warn you not to fall for such shenanigans.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It barely feels like the new year has begun, but 2025 is surging ahead and the season of all things love is just around the corner. In Final Fantasy XIV, that means that Valentione’s Day is making a return, and it will all begin on February 3. 


Get ready to grab your beau and head down to Mih Khetto’s Amphitheatre, because the 2025 Valentione’s event, “With Roses from the Heart” is coming to Eorzea in a little over a week (from the time of writing). Beginning on February 3 and running until February 17, players will have the opportunity to complete a whole new love-themed quest to earn a rather special emote. 


Dote has long been the go-to emote for those wanting to express their love to special friends in FFXIV, and more recently in 2024, we got the Love Heart emote to go alongside it. Now, another emote, the Bouquet emote, is up for grabs for anyone who completes the Valentione’s Event in 2025.

As a side note, if you missed out on the Love Heart emote and are itching to get your hands on it, the start of this year’s Valentione’s event will also bring the Heart emote to the FFXIV Online Store, so you’ll have a chance to fork out a small amount of real-life money and add it to your ever-growing collection. 


Valentione’s Day 2025 will begin at 3 a.m. EST on February 3, and the emote isn’t the only new thing that will be available. As always, we'll see another unique housing item to be purchased with Gil. This year, this item is the “Heartfelt Valentione’s Day Advertisement”, which features artwork from last year’s event.

As is standard by this point, Astrid will be waiting at Mih Khetto’s Amphitheatre after the event goes live, and you’ll be able to pick up the event quest “I Promise You A Rose Garden” by talking to her at coordinates (X:10.2, Y:9.4).

The latest reminder being Snow Town Geek Store, a shopkeeping sim brimming with 2000's non-tude. Like the 2000's themselves, it feels both alive with promise and liable to turn bad at any moment. But I do very much enjoy both its energy and soundtrack, based on what little information is currently available. A tray-tray for you, the discerning tray-tray viewer:

This rod is one of the seven available in the current update, and it's going to cost you a fair amount of credits. But first, you'll have to reach its location, which will require you to solve an interesting puzzle.


How to reach Poseidon Temple in Fisch


For starters, you'll need to reach Atlantis. If you're unsure about how to do that, check out this guide. From the main lobby, go towards a piece of building that looks like a Colosseum, and you'll find a path behind the monument that leads to a pond.

The Witcher 3 is one of the greats, but it had a rather middling start with the original game. The original Devil May Cry trilogy has one of the worst games in existence making the bridge between two truly phenomenal entries. Mass Effect 3 crashed and burned while attempting to land after the two best sci-fi RPGs of all time. The Dead Space trilogy? Oh dear.

Given the success of the franchise reboot – as well as the official remakes –  how could Capcom not jump at the chance to do another entry?


While we don't quite know what the studio has in store, there has been at least one piece of information leaked by an insider. As spotted by Rely on Horror, known leaker Dusk Golem (aka AestheticGamer) says Leon Kennedy will return for Resident Evil 9, adding that he will "100%" be the main character.




This information has been shared on the above Reddit thread (via a screenshot on Imgur), with some additional details thrown into the mix. For example: there's a possibility that the next remake will be of RE: Zero.

Below, we'll outline the FFXIV 2025 calendar's confirmed and tentative event schedule — along with some events that may have wrapped up for the year. Additionally, you can check out the MMO's usual calendar too, along with a little explainer on each of the year's festivities.

I know some of you are old enough to know what a letter opener is, or even to own one. Statistically, most of the RPS readership are Lich Lords. The Maw letter opener differs from regular letter openers in that when you open a letter with it, you will encounter not a letter but a perfect copy of yourself opening a letter in the opposite direction. The two of you must now fight to the death to decide who is the letter-opener and who is the letter. It's yours for a piffling three pints of any available body fluid, but if you don't want to buy a letter opener you can always buy one of this week's new PC games instead.

Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 finds itself at the top of the pack, though a wave of Nintendo titles are snapping at its heels, including Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, Donkey Kong Country Returns HD, Super Mario Party Jamboree, and – strangely enough – Super Mario RPG, which leapfrogged from position 36 all the way up to number 5.

One video creator decided to painstakingly count every instance of playable pee time in cinematic adventure game Heavy Rain. This is vital work. This is important work.

In fairness to Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, which Nic says can be great as a game per se, it does make some effort at settling into Windows. It has rebindable M+K controls. It has DLSS. It has generally more consistent framerates than FFXVI, which could bait you in with silky visuals before grabbing your head and shoving it into the cold ice bath of sub-30fps.
Yet it also steps back from that game on its supported tech, while raising its hardware requirements so far above Final Fantasy 7 Remake that it won’t even launch on a lot of older graphics cards. Even so, hitching and microstuttering issues from FF7 Remake return once more, along with plenty of other signs that this PC version didn’t get the love that a lot of other erstwhile PlayStation exclusives – like Horizon Forbidden West or God of War Ragnarök – did for their ports.

I don't make the rules, that's just how Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 explains the lack of elders in its very French yet very JRPG world. The fantasy game will see you journey across a dangerous landscape to stop the mad "paintress" who's magically culling humanity at younger and younger ages every year. We've been keeping a weary middle-aged eye on its development, and yesterday it got a release date. It's too late for most of us in the RPS treehouse. But watch the trailer for yourself, maybe you'll make it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We called Amplitude's fiendish and fanciful strategy game Endless Legend the best 4X of 2014, and its hexcellence hasn't dimmed with age. "The music, the amazing variety in terrain and units, the sheer quantity of words bringing to life every last quest, minor faction, creature, and environmental anomaly," breathed a reverential Ollie in 2023. "It's a simply splendid game." Like somebody commenting on the sturdiness of an original Picasso's frame, I will only add that it now runs pretty comfortably on the current least expensive Dell Thinkpad.
Why in Meier's name would Sega choose to sell off the studio behind such a worldly wonder? The answer is lost in time (it's through that link, there), but fortunately, Amplitude endure as an independent - and they've just announced Endless Legend 2 with no less than Hooded Horse as publisher. Here's the announcement trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Typical, really. I get all excited about sharing details from a preview event for upcoming FPS Doom: The Dark Ages, then it turns out the gameplay reveal video is going public before the embargo anyway. Then the alleged release date allegedly leaks, allegedly. How am I supposed to present myself as a font of knowledge now, Id? Fortunately, we had a roundtable interview afterward with executive producer Marty Stratton and game director Hugo Martin. Sweet, job-justifying details!
Writing up the interview in full would involve typing out the words "awesome", "slaughter", "core pillars", and "iPod" more times than anyone realistically needs to read. Instead, here's a list of every detail I found interesting that isn't already covered in the showcase.

If you were Edwin, Brendy, or myself - which, statistically, you are not - you were writing news articles about one of three aspirant spiritual successors to detective RPG Disco Elysium. It was an "I'm Spartacus"-ass day of press releases, culminating in the announcement of a project from former ZA/UM writers Argo Tuulik and Olga Moskvina.
Before that came sci-fi RPG XXX Nightshift, and before that was an unnamed "psychogeographic RPG" from newly formed Longdue. We now know that it's called Hopetown, and Longdue are set to launch a crowdfunding campaign which you can "pre-register" for here, should you wish. Here's the sell:

Between its multiple release date delays in response to Star Wars Outlaws not selling as well as Ubisoft would've liked, and Ubi potentially being bought by Tencent as they clamour for help, there's a sense that Shadows needs to deliver not only a great game, but corporate redemption.
I've now played Shadows for four hours, having dipped into a bit of prologue action, some open world exploration, and a questline as both the hulking Yasuke and the lithe Naoe. Have Ubi delivered? I think there's a strong chance. What I played was a lot of comforting Creeding, carried along by a gorgeous interpretation of Edo Japan, and some subtle tweaks to up stealth stakes. Although I do think the two protagonists are a split personality that doesn't quite work for me.

As I amble into a random village, my eye is caught by what feel like carefully observed period flourishes: a particular arrangement of crops in a sloping field, a woman praying at a shrine by the gate. Some of these sights and sounds unlock codex entries, layering up the pedagogic texture.

I am thrust headlong into each of these obstacles a dozen times before my withered synapses and tired bones internalise these arboreal teachings and I make it safely to the bottom.

As in life, there is joy to be found in this journey precisely because it is hard. Unlike in life, the camera is often facing backwards while you do it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Readers, I have spent two full days in the benchmark pits to tell you what you've already guessed: the GeForce RTX 5090 is very fast, too expensive, and laden with more AI tech than Philip K. Dick’s cheese dreams. At least two of those points will, I’m sure, send the average graphics card shopper running, especially at a time when even game developers are growing suspicious of generative AI and its many-thumbed, robot-voiced nostrums.
Yet while there’s not much to be done about the RTX 5090 costing at minimum £1939 / $1999, hundreds more than the infamously spenny RTX 4090, its suite of more purely performance-focused artificial intelligence tools is – dare I say it – quite neat. These range from Multi Frame Generation (MFG), which is basically DLSS 3 frame gen but up to twice as fast, to DLSS 4’s general upscaling enhancements and even the ability to apply newer DLSS versions to older games. All this will come to the rest of the RTX 50 series as well, with some trickling down to the enter RTX range, so maybe the RTX 5090 is best understood not as a practical GPU purchase in itself but as a Picadilly Square-filling advert for its more affordable siblings can do.

They are partnering with a game studio to create a playable adaptation of Macbeth from the point of view of someone examining Lady Macbeth's computer for dirt. Lili looks a lot like the interactive drama popularised by Sam Barlow's Her Story and Telling Lies. Except this has the added twist of being set in contemporary Iran. The game "will see Macbeth’s witches reimagined as hackers, with surveillance cameras and cyber-infiltration putting the player at the heart of the story..." Witchy hackers? I'm in.

Thorson and programmer Noel Berry have found making something "bigger and better" than Celeste exhausting, and have decided to work on smaller projects in future.

I haven't taken a shower in days and a fly has gotten into the cab, buzzing around my ears, anticipating the feast that will come from my sweaty summer death. I just spent nearly an hour driving this tractor to the shop, buying car parts, and rumbling back in the dark. I took my eyes off the road for two seconds to turn on the headlights. It was a mistake. The road curved sharply and I went off a steep bank, tipping my tractor on its side. The door is stuck, the tractor's wheels spin helplessly. There is no recovering from this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The high-end prebuilt PC market is a battleground for premium prices, but catching a solid deal can save you a significant chunk of change. Case in point: Dell is offering the Alienware Aurora R16 GeForce RTX 4090 gaming PC for $2,899.99, a full $1,000 off the usual price. It's a rare sight to see an RTX 4090 gaming rig dip below the $3,000 mark, especially given the recent uptick in standalone GPU prices.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This review contains some story spoilers for the original FF7 and subsequently some elements of Rebirth, but doesn't spoil how Rebirth ultimately reinterprets these elements. 
I argued with myself for several weeks in university about whether to go to a seminar discussing T.S. Eliot's The Love Song Of J. Alfred Prufrock. The poem meant enough to me that I didn't want to dissect it with a class. I wanted to keep for myself. I went in the end, and though I hesitated, I talked because I had things to say. It didn't kill the poem for me, but it does have a slightly awkward gait now, having never quite recovered from the incisions.
I now have to etherise Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth. Cait Sith is splayed upon a table. It's all scalpels, forceps, and oversized novelty dice. It's a strange way to treat art you love. The feeling I remember most from Rebirth on release is how grateful I felt to be alive to play it. Acute, active awareness of my own mortality with thoughts like "it would be properly shit if I died right now because I'd really like to see how this pans out". A personal 'never kill yourself' moment months before the meme gave voice, as the best often do, to an obscure and precious feeling.
An RPG where your character sometimes knocks on doors before opening them? What a time to be alive.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the UK, May has hitherto been a month of innocent delight and sacred observance, with no less than two bank holidays. On May Day - a festival of ancient origins that shares a date with International Workers' Day - the youths of the village garb themselves in daisies, erect huge candy-striped maypoles, and dance around them in an effort to get all entangled and possibly end up kissing. NO MORE. For May is now the month of DOOM. It marks the coming of a new Dark Age.
Which is to say, it's when we'll get to play id Software's cacodemon-booping FPS Doom: The Dark Ages, going by a leaked release date ahead of tomorrow's Xbox Developer Direct.

Luckily, you're very good at speeches, which you can use to blame all the realm's ills on other people. "It was the lion faction! They raised taxes!" you shout and point with one hand, holding a big bag emblazoned "taxes I done stole from the people" with the other. It worked! Now, the members from the other factions that are personally annoyed about taxes will come cull the lion faction down to a more manageable size. Bloody love a bit of politics, me!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Many moons ago in the Before Times, a mysterious cataclysm scattered a number of seasoned BioWare developers across the face of heaven. The developers fell upon the mortal planes like comets. Where each landed, a game development studio took root. Inflexion Games. Summerfall Studios. Humanoid Origin. Worlds Untold. Archetype Entertainment.
Summerfall appear to be prospering, but many of the studios founded by former BioWare devs have experienced hard times. In particular, Humanoid Origin and Worlds Untold have respectively closed and "paused operations" without releasing a single game. I'm raising a tentatively congratulatory glass, then, to Yellow Brick Games, a studio founded by former Dragon Age director Mike Laidlaw. The company's debut game Eternal Strands will release on 28th January, and there's now a PC demo.

Things were different then, but the core of this minimalist city builder strategy remains: you'll need to actively train your kingly eyes on your feckless underlings if you want them to do any work. Don't watch the wheat fields, no food. Don't watch the barracks, no knights. You'll need those knights to defend from attacks too. Do you see how it all connects?! Do you?! Please, do your research.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Debate continues to rage on the internetworks about whether premium video games, and especially the ones with the largest budgets, need to have higher price tags. This time, the culprit is Matthew Ball of analyst firm Epyllion, who remarks in a sprawling State Of Videogaming 2025 report that "some gamemakers hope GTA 6 will be priced at $80-$100 [in the USA], breaking the $70 barrier and helping $50 titles to move up to $60, $60 to $70, $70 to $80, etc."
Picked up by VGC, these comments have now been circulated on social media, and have attracted the extremely polarised mixture of responses you're probably expecting. Among those chipping in is Larian's director of publishing Michael Douse, who makes the familiar argument that overall prices for games like GTA aren't necessarily higher today when you factor in economic inflation, while also acknowledging that up-front price alone doesn't explain the industry's recent mass livelihood devastation, and that few people would happily pay that much for a video game - not even Our Lord In Open Worlding GTA.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The relaxing fish catchin' and scratchcard gamblin' of Webfishing proved itself deeply attractive to anyone looking for an easygoing escape. So it makes sense at least one other developer is looking to apply the same lo-fi principles to their own "hangout game". The simply titled Sledding Game looks like a chill afternoon of standing around on mountains with your mates and going for a big slide downhill every now and again. It's still early in development, as you can tell from the trailer below. But you'll be able to embody penguins, frogs, and polar bears as they drink hot cocoa in log cabins and ragdoll into one another willy-nilly. Other cute animals are to be confirmed, but I am putting my money on an dopey-faced ermine.

Of the new strategy game demos I've spotted so far, the one that interests me most is Calyx, in which you are at war with a mass of alien vegetation, which expands toward your base in a blossoming, suffocating avalanche of green moss and purple tendril. It seems a bit raw at the level of controls and performance, but the concept is very promising: basically, imagine if Creeper World 4 were a bit more like Ground Control. Here's a trailer.

You just waft your knife around dramatically while the slaughtered quarry peacefully disappears and chunks of dino component materialise in your inventory.

"Found a good'un," I wrote in Slack shortly after playing Mohrta's Steam demo. "It's so rad and strange!". Well, that's the pitch, reader. It's a "nonlinear FPS game blending action, exploration, and light dungeon crawling". Very rad. Very strange. Nom nom.

I think your character is supposed to kindle them automatically when you venture into a dungeon - at which point the view switches, classic Ultima-style, from top-down into first-person. My character never deigns to light a torch, however. Possibly this is because, no matter how many torches I loot or buy from the underworld's infrequent traders, my character page always tells me I have none. Is my character eating them? Are they too afraid to light them and expose what those dungeons contain? Do I need to read the manual properly? Or is it just a bug?

I've just got done tearing my face away from the screen it was attached to by the glitter and amphetamine-infused superglue secreted by Mindwave's minigame barrage. The current Steam demo is a generous slice of a wonderful thing its developers describe as a "cerebral microgame frenzy".

The bite-sized two-player shooter was one of our favourite games of last year, summoning the fast-paced killthrills of ancient Quake servers as much as the quickfire 1v1 scraps of the gulag in Call of Duty: Warzone. And now it has a bunch of new maps. Not content with making the powerful pew-pew 'em up completely free (WHAT), the developers have added new weapons, features and a further 30 bullet-pocked arenas. And look, an icy and divisive fan-made map of ye olde Counter-Strike appears among them.

Lumon by Mark Gomersall is a free number clicker based the fourth best television show ever made (Succession, Hannibal, Scavenger's Reign, discuss). It's not a rip-roaring videogame time or anything, but it is cute. More importantly, it's topical. More importantly, it means I get to write "Severance is back!" a bunch. It's back! It is!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In 2024, legal action taken by Spain's top-tier football league led to telecoms giant Telefonica disclosing the identities of alleged pirates among its own subscribers. Telefonica's cooperation was to be expected, as it just obtained the rights to broadcast LaLiga matches for 1.2 billion euros. In contrast, details of an anti-piracy agreement between the two companies, one that seems to operate in the opposite direction, wasn't expected at all.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Team Cherry's long-awaited metroidvania Hollow Knight: Silksong will be re-revealed in April, if you believe a bunch of frantic reddit posts about cake. The standard practice when writing up such fan theorising is to walk you through it step by step, peeling back the layers like Inspector Clouseau. But I know that you are a busy person, so I will jam it all into a single sentence: a Twitter account purporting to be a Silksong developer has posted a tweet that seemingly predicts the Switch 2 announcement while using a profile picture of some cake taken from a recipe book that was published on 2nd April 2024 which is exactly a year before 2nd April 2025 which is the date of the Nintendo Direct teased in the Switch 2 announcement.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There’s a lot you can do with a third dimension. Texture. Nativity dioramas. Spheres. Hyper Light Breaker, in expanding from the 2D action of Hyper Light Drifter, chooses to almost entirely remake itself as a free-roaming roguelike, trading post-apocalyptic pixel art for big proc-gen vistas and even more acrobatic swordplay.
Its technical ambition, sadly, ends up undermined by the emptiness of its world, the lack of exploratory pleasure that Drifter nurtured so well, and combat that’s more faithful to the original yet doesn’t quite adapt well enough to 3D. Not to mention it has more than its fair share of early access bugs and, especially in the early stages, balancing missteps.

Lots of howling round these parts. 


You play a mother, Ro, whose son has been claimed by the Grim Reaper, or whatever they had instead of the Grim Reaper back then - this was, I think, prior to the invention of scythes? And cards? Anyway, while searching for Ro's son, you'll take part in grid- and turn-based battles against a regular cauldron of unspeakables, including disembodied raven heads and what appears to be a huge pair of subterranean lungs. Here's a trailer.

The company have cancelled two online multiplayer games, including one based on God Of War, according to a report by Bloomberg journalist Jason Schreier. Two different Sony-owned studios were recently told to stop development on their projects. One of those studios is Bluepoint, known for their work on the Demon's Souls remake. They were making the unannounced live service God Of War game, according to Schreier. The other studio is Bend, developers of open world zombie 'em up Days Gone. We don't know what they were working on, aside from the fact it was also to have a live service business model. In any case, both have been canned.

If I hold my thumb down on the photo in my phone's gallery, it actually springs to life for a few seconds and rewinds time in the process. It shows me wobble the phone into position and take the snap: a giant crab clings to a restaurant, a lady totters towards us with a white plastic bag looped around her arm, colourful signs stacked like Legos jut out of grey, "The Body Shop" lies in the distance because of course it does.
It means a lot to me, this photo. It's the precise moment I felt excitement shoot through my chest, a pang of "I can't believe I'm back". Then the next morning, a jolt that, in hindsight, definitely altered my brain chemistry. A wave of, "I finally get to disconnect and in many ways, I get to reconnect, too".

Facebook owners Meta, Amazon, Walmart, McDonalds and others are reportedly scaling back their DEI initiatives to stave off backlash or litigation from conservative pundits and politicians, who regard DEI guidance about discrimination as a form of discrimination in itself. Following the election, I've also noticed a couple of video game company executives express misgivings about DEI - misgivings that, amongst other things, illustrate that "DEI" has come to mean a lot more than just annual training about micro-aggressions.

Then I pushed past that final boss, mopping up the remainder of the map, and in that last 25% I think I fell in love. Minishoot' Adventures is straightforward in concept, but its execution is a masterclass of craftsmanship.

Animal Well, which turned damn near every games journalist into a tiresome obsessive? Not nominated for anything. UFO 50, an impressive, important, big boy achievement snubbed by our own 2024 list? It did get a Grand Prize nomination. 

I don't disagree with any of the nominees or absences in this year's Independent Games Festival Awards, so I don't mention any of the above to stir up trouble. Instead I look at this list and think: wow, video games are more varied than ever, so much so that there's no longer a dominant cultural narrative even within the specific niche of indie gaming.

When I tell this to people, one of the most common responses is: hey, you should play Lil Gator Game. I have played Lil Gator Game, and yep: it's good, too. A similarly knockabout outdoor adventure with a cast of vibrant characters. Now it's getting a new "game-sized" expansion called Lil Gator Game: In The Dark.

Night In The Woods nailed the assignment so thoroughly, and is so beloved, that you're in for some tough comparisons. Afterlove EP has plenty going for it that makes it seem like it might be able to hold its own, however. It's set in the city of Jakarta, Indonesia, for one. It was conceived of by the creator of Coffee Talk, another beloved game, for another. 

It's now got a release date: February 14th.

On the one hand, as a fan of weird forests, which is to say all forests, I'm keen on the prospect of an FPS set in a post-apocalyptic Paris that has been overrun by sentient, pissed-off trees. It's from a team led by a former S.T.A.L.K.E.R. developer, too, and those S.T.A.L.K.E.R. alumni certainly know how to post a good apocalypse. On the other hand, the announcement video suggests a game in which you will mostly treat the frenzied flora as a source of "emergent" cover and terrain traps. Have a look.

It's a smaller-scale, squad-managerial affair reminiscent of the ancient Myth: Fallen Lords, though the "painterly" art direction reminds me more of the impressionistic World War 1 fable 11-11: Memories Retold.

The other developer, Arachne, recently left game development after recovering from a mishandled surgical procedure last year. According to Dizzie, her departure doesn't have anything to do with the aforesaid violent crime, which pre-dates their relationship.

That's plenty to get your head around, and the roster is expanding rapidly. NetEase have announced that they plan to introduce a new hero approximately every six weeks - in other words, twice per three-month season. I wonder how long it'll take them to probe beyond the obvious Marvel headliners and start seriously abrading the bottom of the Connected Universe barrel. Nagneto, for example. Or how about J. Pennington Pennypacker, who shoots coins out of his wrists?

OK, how about when you were a kid and you lifted up a nice, round stone and the damp, fertile soil beneath writhed away from you in a fervent knotting of pellucid, boneless bodies and the tickling of a thousand little legs? Right. Anoxia Station is that and also, a turn-based strategy game about drilling for oil. The recently released Itch.io demo is rough around the edges, but I do adore the vibe.

Interesting, perhaps, but after 15 years of effort, did site-blocking actually work and, if so, who benefited, and how?

If rumour speak true, it's being made in Unreal Engine 5, and will feature changes to core systems like blocking, stamina, and sneaking.

But it was very messy because it was my first game and I didn't know what the hell I was doing. So I found myself, when it came to pumping content out, I was like: oh, shit. This code base is fucking awful. Like, I can't put stuff together easily. I'm running into bugs everywhere. But now shit just works!"
You might know Sam Prebble as Trigger Happy Interactive, the solo developer behind frenetic FPS Turbo Overkill. Before that he went by a different name, attached to a very different project. Total Chaos, first released in 2018 under the moniker Wadaholic, is a total conversion mod for Doom 2. With its focus on a thick survival horror atmosphere of tension and disempowerment, it's about as far removed from Turbo Overkill's manic, Doom Eternal-inspired action as a game can get. As Prebble puts it, the only thing the two projects have in common is the first person perspective. Even so, he found himself returning to Total Chaos after wrapping development on Turbo Overkill, resulting in the standalone remake.

Would I have thought differently if it had copious amounts of gore? No. But would I have had a better time? Probably yes. Well, a former senior artist at Bethesda has revealed in an interview with Kiwi Talkz podcast (cheers VGC for the spot) that they'd originally planned for it to have decapitations but decided against them in the end.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We often get sent so many games from publishers and developers that we simply don't have the time or capacity to play. But 'tis the start of the year and I felt like I had a duty to give some of them a proper whirl and see what's what. Thus I was lured once again into the roguelike genre, for which I am an eternal sucker.
Developed by Wave Game, Magicraft sees you play as a kid who's isekai'd into another dimension (or at least, I think he is, because I chose the option to "skip the story" when I selected new game and only later deduced the situation) and tasked to mince all the demons within it. It's typical fantasy fare with an interesting twist: you can combine any number of spells within your inventory, which made me feel very clever, even if I had no idea what I was doing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Like it or not, horror gaming is often built on jump scares. Deriding a good cheap scare ignores the endorphin rush that draws so many players to the genre, in the same way that the "elevated horror" trend forfeits some of the soul of schlocky slasher flicks and ghost movies. Don’t get me wrong, Silent Hill and Alan Wake deserve their flowers - but even those games would wither on the screen if Pyramid Head didn’t bust through a wall from time to time.
One unsung jump scare game in particular pioneered horror in the internet age, blazing everywhere from nascent social media to major television networks. In fact, if you had an internet connection circa 2005, there’s a good chance you played it. Alas, it was too ahead of its time, too successful at leveraging virality before viral horror was sought after. Next time you see a streamer throw their headphones across the room in fright, beware: the spirit of Scary Maze Game is right behind you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here be your first moving-picture look at The Blood of Dawnwalker, the dark fantasy RPG in the works at Rebel Wolves – the studio founded by a bunch of former The Witcher 3 and Cyberpunk 2077 devs. As hinted at a couple of times over previous years, when it was known simply as Dawnwalker, you’ll be playing as a vampire, employing various spooky powers to fight militiamen (and, it seems, at least one giant mechanical spider-thing) amidst a deadly plague outbreak.
Unsurprisingly, in retrospect, the trailer also has big The Witcher vibes. The stringy orchestral music? The dramatic monologues? The horrible things happening to armoured grunts? This thing’s really playing the Polish fantasy hits.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The "spance" of Annihilate The Spance is apparently “an ancient, roiling storm of matter and energy” that harbours both “extreme and inexplicable phenomena” and “unfathomable riches”. I’m happy to discover this explanation, because at first I thought that “spance” was just a litigation-avoiding, supermarket rebrand of “space”. I was bracing to send the good news to developers Skyglow Softworks that, so far, nobody has managed to copyright “space”, though I’m sure somebody’s tried. Maybe, um, God? 


It’s a relief to know that God won’t be suing Skyglow Softworks for breach of copyright, because off the back of two demo missions, Annihilate The Spance is worryingly compelling. It’s a mixture of space RTS and autobattler, wherein you construct bases that produce spanceships who autopilot towards the nearest and largest concentration of enemies. According to the developers, it’s inspired by the 2011 Flash game Obliterate Everything by CWWallis (RIP), which I dimly recall playing while I was running a browser game blog for AOL. Anyway, here’s a trailer.

S úctou a upřímnou pokorou jsem přistoupil k aranžmá národní slovenské hymny "Nad Tatrou sa blýská" již v roce 2016. Hudebně vychází z původní lidové písně a již dávno zažité sestupné basové linky původně inspirované čardášem. V monumentální instrumentaci zaznívá důstojné a bohaté "hradní" Maestoso s výraznou smyčcovou figurací a dramatické Presto s vypjatým protihlasem tak kontrastně jako dunajské nížiny a Vysoké Tatry. Důvodem vzniku bylo hledání krásy a síly slovenské hudby s duchovním nadhledem mně tolik blízké mahlerovské angažovanosti. Velmi důležitá při tom pro mě byla noblesa a hudební kultivovanost při zachování původní písně. Nový rozměr je u mě h…]]></summary>
