Until now. Almost four years later, the console maker and publisher of this game hit MacDonald with a DMCA request to have the patch removed from the internet.

When the Switch launched, its new Joy-Con controllers were dreamy little wonders stuffed with neat tech and surprises.
Unfortunately, the biggest surprise was an unwelcome one - with time, the sticks were prone to drifting on their own accord, and the widespread problem caused many a Switch gamer's opinion to sour. The pads' small size also created problems for many players with larger hands, with some of us forking out for a Pro Controller or switching to a grip or third-party alternative for handheld play.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nvidia's DLSS upscaling tech has slowly but certainly become a necessity if you're playing cutting-edge AAAs. The more you know about DLSS, the more effectively you can use it, and I find that DLSS Presets, specifically, are important if you care about image quality and motion clarity.


Here are the facts, then: DLSS has become something of a universal upscaler since 2018, thanks in no small part due to Nvidia's effective stranglehold on the PC gaming market. More specifically, Nvidia GPUs account for over 75% of the graphics processors found in Steam users' PCs, and the RTX 3060 is the most popular single piece of GPU hardware. This means that most PC gamers actually have access to DLSS, which makes it the go-to option over FSR and XeSS in a practical sense.

That was interesting for showing the benefits of Zen 5's full 512-bit data path support compared to the "double pumped" approach with Zen 4 or optionally used via a BIOS option on Zen 5. AVX-512 continues to prove to be very performant and power efficient with AMD Zen 5 processors unlike with the early generations of AVX-512 on Intel processors.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's a lot of hype surrounding Doom: The Dark Ages, especially since the release date was announced, and we were treated to more footage recently. Evidently, id Software continues to move forward with the franchise. Though, where's the harm in holding onto the past?


As I've proven time and time again, Doom will never cease to be relevant so long as people keep modding it. This time, we're looking at a blend of old and new, as ModDB user duskredy brings us Darkfall, a mod for Doom 2 that adds in the weapons from The Dark Ages.


Image via duskredy/ModDB.


Currently in Early Access, it aims to seamlessly marry the two together. We still get the overall visuals of classic Doom, but the modder has incorporated the weapons from the upcoming game in an attempt to "match the official gameplay closely."


Yes, the Shield Saw appears to be present


Obviously, Darkfall can only do so much to match the energy and spirit of Doom: The Dark Ages, seeing as the actual game isn't out yet. As such, the mod is probably relying heavily on the trailers we've been getting, which is still something.


It's nice to see the Shield Saw has made it into Doom 2, as well. This was one of the stand-out items (for me, at least) when we first got a glimpse. It must have made something of an impact, because another modder added the shield to Doom back in June of last year.


If you haven't been keeping up, The Dark Ages is due to release on May 15 and will be coming to PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PS5. And yes, if you are wondering, it will be available on Game Pass from day one. It's also going to be a prequel. Whether it will equal (or surpass) the success of the 2016 reboot and 2020's Eternal remains to be seen at this stage.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pay it starward.
A few years ago, a little tabletop-RPG-inspired visual novel called Citizen Sleeper arrived on the eShop, expertly crafting an experience that tied together dice-rolling mechanics with a player-driven science fiction narrative. It quickly gained a cult following, leading to a short series of free DLC chapters and the announcement of a sequel. Now that Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector is finally here, we’re pleased to report that one-person team Gareth Damian Martin of Jump Over The Age hasn’t lost a step—this new release is everything that the first game was and then some.
Citizen Sleeper 2 cold opens with your conveniently amnesiac character waking up in the clutches of a gangster boss named Laine giving you an angry speech about his claim of ownership over your synthetic body. Before he can literally pull the plug on you and bring about a very swift Game Over, a mysterious ally spirits you away in a small, stolen starship. Your saviour claims to know you and, knowing that Laine will be painting a target on both your backs, you make for a nearby station to hopefully find the resources needed to disappear and earn your freedom.

A California federal court denied a request for a preliminary injunction, ruling that Apple did not act unreasonably or in bad faith when it removed the app following complaints from music industry players and YouTube. The court found that Musi’s proposed injunction would not serve the public interest.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The creator of frying pan simulator Arctic Eggs is working on a fishing game that I am certain will replicate the act of angling in an entirely ordinary and accurate fashion. Its approach to hooks, lines, and sinkers will combine the fishing from Animal Crossing, Sega Bass Fishing, and Webfishing, says developer The Water Museum in a post on Bluesky. It may have a splash of Dredge when it comes to inventory management too. Oh, also, a strange man might imply you are "disappointing someone". Nothing to worry about. And the ocean may or may not turn completely red. These decisions have not been finalised. Everything is okay. It is possible the fish are safe to eat.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hidden away on NASA's Golden Record, an interstellar archive of music, image and sound, there is a recording of a poem by Charles Baudelaire, Élévation, which describes the astral ascent of the soul. Well, part of a poem. Both to free up room on the disc and perhaps, to edit out "the vast sorrows and all the vexations" of the second half, only the first two stanzas appear. The recording in fact ends halfway through a line, which conjures up an intriguing problem for the listener, inasmuch as the thwarted rhyme scheme reveals that the piece is incomplete. A poetically-minded alien might be tempted to fill in the gap. A fancier alien who took a module in postmodernism might hail the poetics of the fragment. A resolutely practical alien who thinks poetry is for losers might read the whole thing, instead, as a set of incoherent navigational prompts, made up of loose prepositions - au-dessus, au-dessus, par delà, par delà.

Xbox is "evolving" and as part of its new strategy, it's now releasing major first-party IP on other platforms. Now, ahead of the 'Switch 2 Direct' this April, Microsoft's gaming division has announced it's bringing its popular open-world arcade racer Forza Horizon 5 to the PS5 this Spring.
While there's no official news about this releasing on Nintendo platforms, there are already some rumours doing the rounds about the same title eventually being ported across to the Switch successor. This information comes from the same source (eXtas1s) who suggested Diablo 4 and a handful of other games could be on the way to the Switch 2 earlier this month.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Video Game History Foundation's immense collection is now available in early access for you to learn about an epic moment in gaming history — or simply peruse at your whim — for free.


VGHF is a nonprofit focusing on keeping and making available all resources pertaining to video games press. The library the foundation just made available to the public contains over 1500 out-of-print gaming magazines and 30,000 files that have been scanned so hard you can even use the text search function on them.


The foundation's previous announcement teased a bunch of surprises, and now we know that even the library's early version is packed with amazing goodies:



A collection of FromSoft's promotional materials, put together by Kris Urquhart, that the people of FromSoft were totally cool with seeing shared online.


Guides for many important game events, such as the 12 first years of E3.


100 CD-ROMS filled with GamePro magazine's archives.


An over-100-hour-long making of the Myst series.


The "Mark Flitman papers", a long list of documents kept by Mark Flitman from the time he worked on big companies such as Konami and Acclaim.








VGHF is a non-profit organization, so all this is made possible by the contributions of people who want game history to stay accessible for all present and future generations of gamers. You can help this cause right here.


The library is now fully accessible online here. Still, be aware that you might encounter a few hiccups as a lot of people are likely to be accessing the site at the same time. All possible issues are likely to either go away by themselves or to get fixed as the archive leaves early access.

Netflix dropped the opening credits for the much-anticipated anime adaptation of Devil May Cry almost out of nowhere, and expectant fans immediately took to the comment section on YouTube to voice pretty much the same reaction across the board: “Well, I wasn’t expecting that.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The makers of Forza have just announced via their official blog that Microsoft will be releasing yet another of the Xbox big hitters on the PS5. This time it's Forza Horizon 5, one of the best "chillout" racing games of all time.


The port of Forza Horizon 5 is being developed not just by Turn 10 Studios, the people responsible for all the games in the series so far, but by Panic Button in partnership with Playground games and Turn 10. 




If you're just hearing about Panic Button for the first time, rest assured, as they're behind fantastic Switch ports of Id titles such as Doom (2016) and Doom Eternal.


Microsoft stated that all content from the Xbox version of the game will be present in the game. That includes all existing car packs available in the store, and the Hot Wheels and Rally Adventure expansions. 


And that's not all, as the Forza team is working on a new free content update for all platforms, which will be called Horizon Realms. The new update will allow players to explore a collection of some of the community's favorite Evolving Words, and also a few surprises. The best addition, however, will likely be the chance to cross-play with everyone on Xbox, PlayStation 5, and PC.


"We are excited to see the Forza Horizon 5 community grow with new players on PS5, and we can't wait to see the creativity and skill these new creators, builders, and racers will bring to our vibrant community."


Phil Spencer seemingly was not bluffing when he said the exclusivity model doesn't work for the Xbox, so we're pretty excited to see what other once tightly-guarded Xbox exclusives will be entering the multi-platform zone.


You can wishlist Forza Horizon 5 right now on the PlayStation Store, and wait for it to release sometime during Spring.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This time last year, the finale of Bombservice's Momodora series of indie Metroidvanias had just hit PC, and as revealed during today's PLAYISM Game Show Mini, Moonlit Farewell is making the leap to consoles on February 6, 2025.


While there's no shortage of options for Metroidvanias, there's something truly special about the Momodora series. You'll soon be able to explore this excellent swan song on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch. Here's a Switch trailer from the announcement for another look at what Moonlit Farewell has to offer.




For my money, Momodora: Moonlit Farewell ticks all the right boxes. It's not too long but still clocks in with a beefier adventure than its predecessors. The visuals are outstanding, the bosses are all fun to fight, and the new Sigil system offers up a mix of interesting buffs and tempting risk-reward debuffs. 


As for new stuff, it sounds like the console version will just include content from the major updates, like the Boss Rush mode. The press release also mentions a newly added post-credits boss battle, which was also part of the PC version's March 2024 update. 


It's been 15 years since Guilherme "rdein" Martins first kicked the series off with the original Momodora. If you include the spiritual sequel. Minoria. there are six games in total, each worth the little time they ask of players. It'll be nice to have more options soon to traverse the final entry's expertly-woven map.

However, whenever event-exclusive packs come out, Genetic Apex mysteriously disappears. Don't worry, though; you can still open them right now.

Are Genetic Apex packs gone in Pokemon TCG Pocket?


During Pokemon TCG Pocket events like Space-Time Smackdown, Genetic Apex packs are pushed away from the home screen and instead appear in a separate menu. On your booster pack screen, tap "Select other booster packs" to see every available option, including any current event-exclusive packs, Genetic Apex, and more.


Screenshot by Destructoid


The most likely reason Genetic Apex packs disappear from the home screen is that Pokemon TCG Pocket can advertise ongoing event packs with higher odds of special cards. For example, Space-Time Smackdown features rare cards like Dialga ex, Palkia ex, and Lucario that you can't currently get anywhere else, allowing you to expand your deck beyond usual means.


You can change your booster pack without penalty if you want to return to a more familiar pack. Similarly, if you recently swapped to Genetic Apex but want to try some event packs, you can return to the booster pack list and check them out.


Beyond this, the process is the same. Once you pick Genetic Apex as your current booster pack, you'll find your usual Pikachu, Charizard, and Mewtwo as options. However, closing your Pokemon TCG Pocket app and returning later will show you the event's booster pack screen again, so you'll need to set it back to Genetic Apex each time. If the event ends before you return, you won't have to worry about this until another one starts.

Those who enjoy a little slice of weirdness in their gaming might want to keep an eye on this one. Publisher Crunching Koalas and developer Dexai Arts have today released the first-person bouncer simulator Techno Banter on the Switch eShop and it looks... strange.
This is a game all about deciding which party guests get into a club and which are told to take a hike. It's a similar concept to what we've seen in the likes of Papers, Please and Lil' Guardsman, but Techno Banter mixes things up with, you guessed it, banter. You'll have to use your wit to hit any unruly potential guests with clever comebacks, keeping the party vibing and keeping the line in check.

I have been banging the 'Theme' drum for so long now, my hands have started to hurt. It doesn't make any sense to me that every Switch menu has been this music-less graveyard when Nintendo has churned out the likes of the Wii Shop Channel, 3DS Theme Shop and a multitude of other bangers in years gone by.
But there's another melody missing from Switch that not nearly enough people, myself included, have been rooting for over the past eight years, and if Nintendo is only going to rectify one of its musical mishaps for Switch 2, I hope it's this one: it's time start-up jingles made a comeback.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Marta TOTY Honorable Mentions SBC is now live in EA FC 25, and you can complete the challenge to unlock a special card for your Ultimate Team squad.


The veteran Brazilian has once again made it to the TOTY promo despite missing a spot among the starters. To play with the item, you'll have to complete the challenge before it expires from Ultimate Team. Let's take a look at the easiest way to solve the challenge, and if the SBC is worth completing at all.


EA FC 25 Marta TOTY Honorable Mentions SBC tasks


The Marta TOTY Honorable Mentions SBC has only one task, and here are its conditions.


Task - Marta TOTY Honorable Mentions SBC



Min. 1 Players from: Brazil


Min. 1 Players: Team of the Week


Min. Team Rating: 85



EA FC 25 Marta TOTY Honorable Mentions SBC solutions


Here's a set of solutions you can use to unlock Marta's special card in Ultimate Team. It's a really simple challenge, and you should be having the required fodder in your club. 


Task - Marta TOTY Honorable Mentions SBC



Any 9 85-rated items


Any 85-rated TOTW item


Casemiro 84



For 50,000 coins worth of fodder, you'll be able to get a TOTY Honorable Mentions item, so the pricing is on point. However, the item could have been a lot better than what it is. The card can play in four different positions, but the stats are pretty mediocre. She also has only a single playstyle+, which reduces her potential in competitive modes.


A SBC with a higher completion cost offering a better card will have been far better than what we have received, and that's my biggest issue with this current Honorable Mentions challenge. If you're a beginner, completing the SBC will be well worth your time. Sadly, most players are likely going to have better cards in their squads at this point in time.

It's a crunchy, dicey machine of vibrant world-building that sometimes forgets itself in wandering prose. A compelling universe to sail through, with more habitats and hovels than its predecessor, more stations and stellar gateways. It can't - for me - escape the dense gravity of the first game's compact storytelling and novel character building, no matter how often it funnels you from one space caper to the next. But it has a good time trying.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Lunar New Year Event 2025 has been out for a few days now in Jujutsu Infinite, and many players are intrigued about Red Envelopes.


This item is exclusively part of the limited-time event, and they are a great source of valuable items inside the game. These consumables will help you get special chests that include every piece of item that is associated with the special event. Here's how you can get them.


Best ways to farm Red Envelopes in Jujutsu Infinite


There are two main ways to get a Red Envelope in Jujutsu Infinite. 



Snake Talismans: You can obtain these throughout the Lunar New Year event and use them to purchase Red Envelopes from the Black Market trader. To purchase one Envelope, you'll have to spend 5 Snake Talismans. Here's how you can earn as many talismans as possible.


Red Envelope Chests: I am not sure why this mechanism is present in Jujutsu Infinite, but you can open Red Envelope Chests to get Red Envelopes. The system feels strange as you spend Red Envelopes to open the chests in the first place. 



All Red Envelope Chest rewards in Jujutsu Infinite


Red Envelope Chests can only be opened with Red Envelopes. They always contain Uncommon rewards or above, all items from part of the Lunar New Year Event celebration.




Uncommon



Dark Tang Suit


Scale Patterned Trousers


Lunar Fireworks


Snake Charm


Dumplings



Rare



Patterned Tang Suit


Gilded Patterned Trousers



Legendary



Floral Tang Suit


Dark Patterned Trousers



Special Grade



Lunar New Years Cloak


Red Suit of Good Luck


Red Trousers of Good Luck


Black Mask of The Snake


Red Mask of The Snake



Red Envelopes can be earned only until the Lunar New Year Event is live in Jujutsu Infinite. Hence, players have little over 10 days as of writing, as it all wraps up on February 9.

How to unlock Flippers in Hello Kitty Island Adventure


To unlock Flippers, you must complete the Power Up the Gate and Finding Flippers quests. You'll first encounter the Power Up the Gate mission as you go through the Hello Kitty Island Adventure main storyline (it's pretty early on). Then, you'll trigger the Finding Flippers quest for the swimming feature.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Love will have to wait.
We've been keeping an eye on Date Everything — the romance sim where you can, fittingly, date everything — since it was revealed last summer. A last-minute delay pushed the game to a Valentine's Day 2025 release, but developer Sassy Chap Games has since decided that it still needs a little more time in the oven. Put Cupid on hold, because Date Everything is now expected to launch in June.
In a statement from Sassy Chap Games' Lead Designer Ray Chase, the dev explained that while the game is complete, there's still a whole bunch of testing that needs to be done. Releasing the game in its current state, Chase explains, would be a "disservice", so the team has decided to push things back by a few months to make sure that everything is in tip-top shape.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Graphics card drivers aren't usually a thing one should get excited over, but Nvidia's latest release, 572.16, is worth celebrating. Specifically, Nvidia is now pushing out official support for its Transformer-based DLSS4 upscaler, which comes with a massive suite of visual and performance improvements by default.


There are two main reasons you'd want to update to driver 572.16, and they're both vast boons from a utility point of view. Firstly, you're getting ready access to Transformer-based upscaling via DLSS4, which provides a huge uplift in the supported games' visual quality. The second reason is related to DLSS4, though it is a tad more technical: you get to update old games' crummy DLSS versions to the latest build. Exciting, right?

If the pre-release backlash regarding the price of Donkey Kong Country Returns HD was anything to go by, we might have expected the game to crash and burn mere days after it launched. Alas, the internet is and forever will be its own little bubble, and the game has topped the Japanese charts once again with a total of 35,256 copies sold.
The only newcomer this week is the sublime metroidvania ENDER MAGNOLIA: Bloom in the Mist, which naturally performed much better on the Switch than the PS5, though both managed to crack the top 10. Otherwise, Super Mario Party Jamboree continues to perform well, while Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake is inching ever closer to that 1 million unit milestone.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You’re getting stood up, as Sassy Chap Games has announced that they won’t be making the Valentine’s Day launch date for Date Everything as they had planned. Instead, Date Everything will be coming to PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Switch, and PC on June 25.


This is actually the second time the game has been delayed, as it was originally supposed to arrive on October 24, 2024 before getting moved to February 14, 2025. The Valentine’s Day launch would be very appropriate, but according to the release from Designer Ray Chase, “I was too confident that we could properly test ALL the wild amount of content that exists in this massive game, and unfortunately, we ran out of time on our current release date.” Fair enough.




Date Everything is, of course, the dating sim that allows you to date everything. You wander a house and interact with anthropomorphized versions of, well, everything. From the couch to the icebox. More importantly, you can romance them, because no one understands your problems quite like your bed. I have to wonder if the genre pioneers who worked on games like Tokimeki Memorial thought that this is where things would end up.


The delay is unfortunate, but you don’t want bugs getting involved in your passions. Visual novels can get pretty messy, especially when they branch as much as Date Everything promises to. Even with a lot of planning, every variable you add to the mix has the chance of throwing a wrench into the mix. So, I guess what I’m saying is: I’m sorry your date stood you up, chum. I'm sorry everything stood you up.


Date Everything is now coming to PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Switch, and PC on June 25.

In Civ, Mahatma Gandhi, the famously pro-peace anti-colonialist martyr from India, is often seen as a surprisingly aggressive and nuclear war-prone leader. What the hell is up with that, and why does it happen not just in one game but in many across the series? Let's look into the facts of this mystery to shine a light on Gandhi's alleged war crimes.

Nowhere in the post did the word "layoffs" appear. But this is what the post was actually about. The closest it got to addressing the facts of what happened to an unspecified number of workers is the phrase: "we don’t require support from the full studio." 
It's one of the most disingenuous announcements of job cuts in a recent and plentiful history of job cuts. A weirdly impressive feat from BioWare, considering the last two or three years have seen some spectacular verbal gymnastics from games companies when it comes to shitcanning people. Let's take a look at some of our "favourite" mealy-mouthed press releases in which people have their jobs poetically "sunsetted" rather than, say, dropkicked out the window.

Hello Kitty Island Adventure released on Apple Arcade in July 2023 to generally positive reviews. A year and a half later, the Switch release brings a charming cast of Sanrio characters and their island resort to a wider audience—an audience ultimately in for a good time.
Hello Kitty Island Adventure opens on a plane en route to a mysterious resort with lots of familiar faces from the Sanrio franchise on board. After creating an animal avatar of our own (a moody purple bunny), we soon found ourselves jumping out of the plane and gliding to the ground with a handful of balloons. We get our first major quest shortly after touching down: find everyone who was scattered across the island during the descent.

Although this world of Hello Kitty and her friends only recently entered my life, I have several friends and family who adore these guys. I've lost count of the times my siblings have mentioned Hello Kitty, Kuromi, or Cinnamoroll in random conversations.


For me, this was a blind playthrough of Hello Kitty Island Adventure. Although I'd known about the Apple Arcade version through several friends, I'd never played it myself, making this a fresh start rather than a direct comparison. I mainly thought the characters were cute, but playing this has since made me develop an unexpected appreciation for them and the Sanrio universe, leaving me satisfied for a while.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[More good news in the world of tardy translations, Ratalaika Games and Shinyuden are localizing Technos Japan’s 1991 dice-centric Famicom RPG, Sugoro Quest: Dice Heroes. It’s coming February 7 to Switch, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S.


It’s interesting news coming in the wake of Super Technos World: River City & Arcade Classics, as it will feature the Super Famicom’s Sugoro Quest++: DICENICS, but won’t be providing a translation. I’m not sure if this news makes that more disappointing or less. At least now we’re getting some Sugoro Quest and not none.


Sugoro Quest is something of a cross between a board game and a JRPG. The game world is a series of segmented paths that you roll to traverse. Fights also have you pit your dice against those thrown by enemies. Whoever gets the highest number gets to attack. Somewhat like an actual tabletop RPG. Sort of. Some of them. Maybe.


Was it any good? I’m not sure, personally. I’ve heard good things and have wanted to try it myself, if only because I’m a fan of Technos’ Famicom output. I was a bit bummed that Sugoro Quest++ isn’t being translated in the Super Technos World collection, but I also understand that translating old games isn’t as easy as it sounds, which is why you should appreciate each and every fan effort.


At the same time, new official translations are becoming more common, and it’s great to see. Not only are we getting games like the Shockman series from Ratalaika and Sinyuden, but there are official cartridge releases from folks like Retro-Bit, collections from Arc Systems Works (Sugoro Quest++ aside), and even Nintendo got in on it with their limited-time re-release of the first Fire Emblem game. Great stuff.


Sugoro Quest: Dice Heroes is coming to Switch, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S on February 7, 2025 (thanks to Gematsu for spotting it).

Unlike when the 'Mythical Island' mini-expansion dropped late last year, the arrival of 'Space-Time Smackdown' has pushed the original 'Genetic Apex' set off the TCG Pocket home screen. In fact, when you first open up the app now, Charizard, Mewtwo and Pikachu are nowhere to be seen, replaced by the new Dialga and Palkia art and the Mew addition.

Since it's a Special Grade item, obtaining this tool can be really hard, and it will boil down to luck.

Let's take a look at how you can obtain it in the first place and if the grind is worth it at all.


How to obtain the Ravenous Axe in Jujutsu Infinite


Most of the Cursed Tools in Jujutsu Infinite usually require you to complete certain tasks. To get the Ravenous Axe, you'll have to complete the Numa Temple Set missions or the Kura Camp missions.

A number of Dragon Age: The Veilguard staff are leaving the celebrated RPG company in the course of plans to become "a more agile, focused studio", as BioWare move ahead with the next Mass Effect game. Posting on Bluesky, senior systems designer Michelle Flamm, producer Jen Cheverie, editor Karin West-Weekes, lead writer Trick Weekes and narrative designer Ryan Cormier have all announced that they're looking for work.


All of which feels like it warrants a mention in general manager Gary McKay's recent blog about BioWare's future, but he comments only that they're "taking the opportunity to reimagine" how BioWare operate between projects, and "have worked diligently over the past few months to match many of our colleagues with other teams at EA that had open roles that were a strong fit." Which is a very slippery way to say that you're making a load of people redundant.

Nintendo has announced that the Japanese Switch eShop will soon no longer accept overseas credit cards or PayPal accounts as valid payment methods.
As reported by VGC, the change will come into effect from 25th March 2025, with Nintendo citing "fraudulent use" as a main contributing factor behind the decision. It has not elaborated beyond this, but it's well-known at this point that many overseas Switch owners like to utilise the Japanese eShop for games that either aren't available elsewhere, or perhaps might be cheaper than their regional equivalent.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mere hours before it’s January 30th release – wait, that’s today! – Sony have finally spilled the beans on system requirements for Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, as well as the eye-blistering, GPU-rending special features that more powerful rigs can support. Happily, all these ray tracing and frame generation accoutrements seemingly won’t preclude Spidey 2 from working on older, slower PCs as well, as the minimum specs are surprisingly reasonable.
Granted, they’re only rated for 30fps at a lowly 720p, and you’ll still need to find a honking 140GB of SSD space, but the basic GPU and CPU requirements aren’t too lofty at all. The likes of an RTX 3060 for 60fps/1080p are quite reasonable as well, though you’re staring down the barrel of Nvidia’s pricey RTX 4080 and RTX 4090 cards for high-rez ray tracing.

"An account for PlayStation Network will become optional for these titles on PC," said PlayStation in a short and quiet blog post that includes the upcoming PC release for Spider-Man 2, and The Last Of Us Part II. It's been eight months since PlayStation provoked mass annoyance among PC players by making a PSN account mandatory to play Helldivers 2, and later Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered. They soon walked back the decision for Helldivers 2 after a rough review-bombing but the company didn't seem to fully take the hint. It looks like they've now conceded that, yes, the obligatory sign-up was an unpopular move.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's easy to feel pride when you're flying through space at 1000 metres per second. "Look at my spaceship go," you say to yourself, "look how fast it crashes into that other, smaller ship." Building your own galactic snowpiercer from scratch in Space Engineers 2 will bring a smile to anyone who once revelled in clicking together Lego podracers and bashing them into one another on the living room carpet with a violence eight-year-olds should not yet have mental access to. That said, this is the precise extent of the things you can do in the game so far. Build 'n' crash. Every feature fits in this opening paragraph. There's good reason to trust the developers' ability to deliver the rest of this crafting and survival game. But right now, it's all core, no loop.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Open world spec op gun-brandisher Phantom Line takes place during a paranormal crisis of such intensity that the outbreak of nuclear war gets relegated to bullet point five on the latest press email. Atomic apocalypse? Ehhh. That's a roadside picnic compared to what S.T.A.L.K.S this alternately Lynchian and Tarkovskian battlefield. You'll wish you'd been dusted by nuclear fire when you're being torn open by some kind of demon puppet in a labyrinth of red curtains.


If you do get torn open by a demon puppet, the good news is that players have a range of artificial bodies to choose from. Among Phantom Line's headline features is the HUSK system, which lets you switch between members of your squad right in the middle of combat. Unless, presumably, the body in question is already occupied by one of your co-op partners. If all this sounds appealing, the even-gooder news is that there's now a demo available via the developer Discord.

Or can you? News comes via Nic himself that modder FrancisLouis, whose previous works include performance-enhancing rejigs of various games (and one that turns the Silent Hill 2 remake’s pipe weapon into a rigid, A-posing wife), has produced Fantasy Optimizer: an overhaul of how FF7 Rebirth handles shaders and streamed visuals. Both Nic and myself have tried it out on our respective rigs, and it works! Mostly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Has any genus of graphics card been as dramatically storied as the GeForce XX80s? The RTX 3080 was a thing of beauty, only to be tarnished by the worst wheeler-dealing spree (and crypto mining misappropriation) in PC component history. Then the RTX 4080 rocked up with its laughable £1269 / $1199 price tag, a miscalculation so severe that the RTX 4080 Super looked good – despite hardly being any faster – simply for not repeating it. For the new RTX 5080’s sake, you almost want it to be boring.
It isn’t. But then, neither is it a blood-boiler like the RTX 4080, nor a largely aspirational show-off piece like the RTX 5090. By maintaining the 4080 Super’s course correction on price while tooling up on compelling DLSS 4 improvements, the RTX 5080 is an agreeable GPU from the off. Particularly, if you’ve got the 4K monitor to take full advantage of it.

Which is to say, somebody's finally made a video game version of Hex, the sentient glass hive from Terry Pratchett's Unseen University. In spooky automation-driven strategy sim Microtopia, you manage a swarm of what could either be ants who've been to the ripperdoc, or PC components who've grown legs and antennae. Your goal is to expand an insect colony that is also a motherboard, where glittering pheromone trails double as silicon circuits.
The developers Cordyceps Collective have just announced a release date - February 18th - and what's this, there's a demo as well? Catch the trailer below.

The only "twos" you shall be "merging" in Sniper At Work are bullets and faces. The only "cherries" you shall be "picking" are hoodlums in sore need of a skullful of lead. The only princes you shall acknowledge are their royal highnesses Distance, Wind, and Timing.
You may or may not find all that "soothing" - I won't judge. I will only repeat Nic's observation from the Maw that Sniper At Work look "a bit like Commandos, a bit like Hitman", which I would translate to "my comrade in PC gaming, if historic audience trends are any indication you shall do well here". Right, that's enough quotation marks for one article. There won't be any left for the next interview feature at this rate. Here's the trailer.

Tinny propaganda songs play from TVs too big to comfortably fit in anyone's car. The warehouse is so huge I thought it was outside until I looked up and there was writing on the sky and I realised it was a roof. I'm still messed up about it, honestly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In regular Darkest Dungeon 2, your mind, body and soul are fixed upon the points of a horrible mountain, looming over the inn at the end of every foetid wagon ride. It's sort of Journey for plague doctors, or possibly The Hobbit: Cosmodick Turpin Edition. I enjoy feeling the weight of those distant peaks upon my brain and eyeballs, but it's nice to fire up Kingdoms, the new free DD2 game mode that's launched just today, and have a choice of disasters to trundle toward.  


Over here is an inn being overrun by slathering beastmen. Over there is another, safer inn, but it's inconveniently perched behind a nest of tentacular cultists. In the middle there is you, with the customary DD party of half-dead, half-mad adventurers, equipped with an exciting smorgasbord of sharp edges, cursed artefacts, phobias and diseases. Let us proceed laughing and wailing to the launch trailer.

They're letting 185 people go across their European operations, and will be closing UK-based Ubisoft Leamington, whose recent projects include supporting development of Star Wars Outlaws and Skull And Bones. All this less than two months after jettisoning the hundreds of people who worked on free-to-play shooter XDefiant.

Space Engineers 2 launches into the starry depths of early access today, although it is currently limited to a single player creative mode. It's the sequel to the sci-fi shipbuilding game we quite enjoyed here at RPS. At this early alpha stage, the not-yet-a-survival-game invites players to create galleons of the galaxy, block by shiny metal block, and then drive those ships into one another at 300 metres per second.

It's a fertilized duck egg, boiled or steamed, in which you can still see the duck embryo as you munch. I'm too old to discover this acquired taste on a gap year, but I'm not too old to waltz down the horror aisle in Itch.io, throwing retro jumpscarers into my basket. Which is where first-person Filipino suspense game Hapunan can be found. You play a young street food vendor hawking the eggs on a quiet corner late at night. Naturally, something alarming is afoot.

First, there was Dynasty Warriors: Origins, which I enjoyed quite a bit. Then Ninja Gaiden 2 Black got a surprise release. Now, we're getting Team Ninja's Rise Of The Ronin this coming March - the 11th to be precise. I'd do a bit about stealth drops but I'm at the point where using game-thematic verbs makes me want to collapse on a bed of caltrops, throat first. Here's a trailer:

It's a single-button affair, having you navigate levels by alternating a pivot-point on a shape I don't know the name of so I'm just going to call a spinny stick.
There are moving background elements in some stages - in others, you make your own pace. Except I can't really make my own pace, can I Bauhaus Bonk? Because the swing soundtrack makes me feel like a plodding buffoon if I'm not responding with appropriate gusto. This is entrapment, game. I am devilishly compelled by swing, like a Reefer Madness extra.

I know some of you are old enough to know what a letter opener is, or even to own one. Statistically, most of the RPS readership are Lich Lords. The Maw letter opener differs from regular letter openers in that when you open a letter with it, you will encounter not a letter but a perfect copy of yourself opening a letter in the opposite direction. The two of you must now fight to the death to decide who is the letter-opener and who is the letter. It's yours for a piffling three pints of any available body fluid, but if you don't want to buy a letter opener you can always buy one of this week's new PC games instead.

But if you idly wonder where the rivers in Skyrim go, I will follow along dutifully like a baby elephant. This is how I ended up spending much of my afternoon watching David Cage characters pissing. One video creator decided to painstakingly count every instance of playable pee time in cinematic adventure game Heavy Rain. This is vital work. This is important work.

In fairness to Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, which Nic says can be great as a game per se, it does make some effort at settling into Windows. It has rebindable M+K controls. It has DLSS. It has generally more consistent framerates than FFXVI, which could bait you in with silky visuals before grabbing your head and shoving it into the cold ice bath of sub-30fps.
Yet it also steps back from that game on its supported tech, while raising its hardware requirements so far above Final Fantasy 7 Remake that it won’t even launch on a lot of older graphics cards. Even so, hitching and microstuttering issues from FF7 Remake return once more, along with plenty of other signs that this PC version didn’t get the love that a lot of other erstwhile PlayStation exclusives – like Horizon Forbidden West or God of War Ragnarök – did for their ports.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you turn 33 years old in the next couple of months then, sorry, you are dead. I don't make the rules, that's just how Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 explains the lack of elders in its very French yet very JRPG world. The fantasy game will see you journey across a dangerous landscape to stop the mad "paintress" who's magically culling humanity at younger and younger ages every year. We've been keeping a weary middle-aged eye on its development, and yesterday it got a release date. It's too late for most of us in the RPS treehouse. But watch the trailer for yourself, maybe you'll make it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[How many times can video games riff on that one Dr Who episode with the weeping statues? At least once more. Surgeon Simulator devs Bossa have just announced Don't Get Got, in which you and up to seven of your so-called friends are trapped in a large school with randomised objectives and safe rooms. Also in the school: a bunch of horrifying little boys in shorts and braces.


It's out in early access today. Yes, they've sprung this one on us like a ghastly Jack-in-the-box. Steady your nerves and watch the trailer.

A new trailer for action adventure game South Of Midnight sees players battering monsters from the folklore of the US' Deep South. It shows hero Hazel arguing with her mum before a supernatural hurricane cuts off the family drama and sends Hazel wandering the swamps to encounter giant alligators, giant fish, giant dolls, and giant people. Maybe Hazel is just very small. Either way, it also dangles an important morsel in front of our snapping jaws: a release date. Come see.

Since then, the specialist anti-piracy unit has targeted pirates of all kinds. The Intellectual Property Office's latest Report and Accounts states that PIPCU is funded using millions of pounds from 'IPO surpluses.' That money appears to have been put to work; PIPCU reports reveal successes against large-scale IPTV pirates and in one case, a record-breaking restraint of ill-gotten gains.

I'd say it has materialised from the darkness like a ninja, but there are a lot of ninjas in circulation at the minute, and my analogy-jitsu gauge is running dry. So instead, I'm going to say that it has materialised from the darkness like a resurfacing duck, its beak stuffed with pond vegetation. The pond vegetation, here, stands for "tweaks to the weapons upgrade system". Here's a trailer.

"The music, the amazing variety in terrain and units, the sheer quantity of words bringing to life every last quest, minor faction, creature, and environmental anomaly," breathed a reverential Ollie in 2023. "It's a simply splendid game." Like somebody commenting on the sturdiness of an original Picasso's frame, I will only add that it now runs pretty comfortably on the current least expensive Dell Thinkpad.
Why in Meier's name would Sega choose to sell off the studio behind such a worldly wonder? The answer is lost in time (it's through that link, there), but fortunately, Amplitude endure as an independent - and they've just announced Endless Legend 2 with no less than Hooded Horse as publisher. Here's the announcement trailer.

Between its multiple release date delays in response to Star Wars Outlaws not selling as well as Ubisoft would've liked, and Ubi potentially being bought by Tencent as they clamour for help, there's a sense that Shadows needs to deliver not only a great game, but corporate redemption.
I've now played Shadows for four hours, having dipped into a bit of prologue action, some open world exploration, and a questline as both the hulking Yasuke and the lithe Naoe. Have Ubi delivered? I think there's a strong chance. What I played was a lot of comforting Creeding, carried along by a gorgeous interpretation of Edo Japan, and some subtle tweaks to up stealth stakes. Although I do think the two protagonists are a split personality that doesn't quite work for me.

As I amble into a random village, my eye is caught by what feel like carefully observed period flourishes: a particular arrangement of crops in a sloping field, a woman praying at a shrine by the gate. Some of these sights and sounds unlock codex entries, layering up the pedagogic texture.

I am thrust headlong into each of these obstacles a dozen times before my withered synapses and tired bones internalise these arboreal teachings and I make it safely to the bottom.

As in life, there is joy to be found in this journey precisely because it is hard. Unlike in life, the camera is often facing backwards while you do it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dwarf Fortress's Adventure mode - a procedurally generated campaign that lets you approach the famously dense colony sim like a more traditional roguelite - is now out as a free update on Steam. The game represents perhaps the most cavernous, yawping blind spot in my entire pile of shame. I do own it, but I'm yet to play. I've already read a great deal of extended wordery on its merits - please, sell it to me in the comments in seven words or less. Here's a trailer:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Readers, I have spent two full days in the benchmark pits to tell you what you've already guessed: the GeForce RTX 5090 is very fast, too expensive, and laden with more AI tech than Philip K. Dick’s cheese dreams. At least two of those points will, I’m sure, send the average graphics card shopper running, especially at a time when even game developers are growing suspicious of generative AI and its many-thumbed, robot-voiced nostrums.
Yet while there’s not much to be done about the RTX 5090 costing at minimum £1939 / $1999, hundreds more than the infamously spenny RTX 4090, its suite of more purely performance-focused artificial intelligence tools is – dare I say it – quite neat. These range from Multi Frame Generation (MFG), which is basically DLSS 3 frame gen but up to twice as fast, to DLSS 4’s general upscaling enhancements and even the ability to apply newer DLSS versions to older games. All this will come to the rest of the RTX 50 series as well, with some trickling down to the enter RTX range, so maybe the RTX 5090 is best understood not as a practical GPU purchase in itself but as a Picadilly Square-filling advert for its more affordable siblings can do.

They are partnering with a game studio to create a playable adaptation of Macbeth from the point of view of someone examining Lady Macbeth's computer for dirt. Lili looks a lot like the interactive drama popularised by Sam Barlow's Her Story and Telling Lies. Except this has the added twist of being set in contemporary Iran. The game "will see Macbeth’s witches reimagined as hackers, with surveillance cameras and cyber-infiltration putting the player at the heart of the story..." Witchy hackers? I'm in.

Thorson and programmer Noel Berry have found making something "bigger and better" than Celeste exhausting, and have decided to work on smaller projects in future.

I haven't taken a shower in days and a fly has gotten into the cab, buzzing around my ears, anticipating the feast that will come from my sweaty summer death. I just spent nearly an hour driving this tractor to the shop, buying car parts, and rumbling back in the dark. I took my eyes off the road for two seconds to turn on the headlights. It was a mistake. The road curved sharply and I went off a steep bank, tipping my tractor on its side. The door is stuck, the tractor's wheels spin helplessly. There is no recovering from this. I restart the game for the third or fourth time, not knowing whether to laugh or sob.
My Summer Car is as hardcore as they come. It does not simply throw you in at the deep end. It ties you up in a cloth sack with 50 kg of lug nuts and dumps you in the Baltic sea. "Sink or swim!" yells this game at you, but in Finnish, so even that you cannot understand. To a certain kind of person, this is an act of love.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This review contains some story spoilers for the original FF7 and subsequently some elements of Rebirth, but doesn't spoil how Rebirth ultimately reinterprets these elements. 
I argued with myself for several weeks in university about whether to go to a seminar discussing T.S. Eliot's The Love Song Of J. Alfred Prufrock. The poem meant enough to me that I didn't want to dissect it with a class. I wanted to keep for myself. I went in the end, and though I hesitated, I talked because I had things to say. It didn't kill the poem for me, but it does have a slightly awkward gait now, having never quite recovered from the incisions.
I now have to etherise Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth. Cait Sith is splayed upon a table. It's all scalpels, forceps, and oversized novelty dice. It's a strange way to treat art you love. The feeling I remember most from Rebirth on release is how grateful I felt to be alive to play it. Acute, active awareness of my own mortality with thoughts like "it would be properly shit if I died right now because I'd really like to see how this pans out". A personal 'never kill yourself' moment months before the meme gave voice, as the best often do, to an obscure and precious feeling.
An RPG where your character sometimes knocks on doors before opening them? What a time to be alive.

From your tower, you gaze down at four factions, each with their own members and complaints. If any one faction gets too large, they'll rebel against you. Luckily, you're very good at speeches, which you can use to blame all the realm's ills on other people. "It was the lion faction! They raised taxes!" you shout and point with one hand, holding a big bag emblazoned "taxes I done stole from the people" with the other. It worked! Now, the members from the other factions that are personally annoyed about taxes will come cull the lion faction down to a more manageable size. Bloody love a bit of politics, me!

The developers fell upon the mortal planes like comets. Where each landed, a game development studio took root. Inflexion Games. Summerfall Studios. Humanoid Origin. Worlds Untold. Archetype Entertainment.
Summerfall appear to be prospering, but many of the studios founded by former BioWare devs have experienced hard times. In particular, Humanoid Origin and Worlds Untold have respectively closed and "paused operations" without releasing a single game. I'm raising a tentatively congratulatory glass, then, to Yellow Brick Games, a studio founded by former Dragon Age director Mike Laidlaw. The company's debut game Eternal Strands will release on 28th January, and there's now a PC demo.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Debate continues to rage on the internetworks about whether premium video games, and especially the ones with the largest budgets, need to have higher price tags. This time, the culprit is Matthew Ball of analyst firm Epyllion, who remarks in a sprawling State Of Videogaming 2025 report that "some gamemakers hope GTA 6 will be priced at $80-$100 [in the USA], breaking the $70 barrier and helping $50 titles to move up to $60, $60 to $70, $70 to $80, etc."
Picked up by VGC, these comments have now been circulated on social media, and have attracted the extremely polarised mixture of responses you're probably expecting. Among those chipping in is Larian's director of publishing Michael Douse, who makes the familiar argument that overall prices for games like GTA aren't necessarily higher today when you factor in economic inflation, while also acknowledging that up-front price alone doesn't explain the industry's recent mass livelihood devastation, and that few people would happily pay that much for a video game - not even Our Lord In Open Worlding GTA.

So it makes sense at least one other developer is looking to apply the same lo-fi principles to their own "hangout game". The simply titled Sledding Game looks like a chill afternoon of standing around on mountains with your mates and going for a big slide downhill every now and again. It's still early in development, as you can tell from the trailer below. But you'll be able to embody penguins, frogs, and polar bears as they drink hot cocoa in log cabins and ragdoll into one another willy-nilly. Other cute animals are to be confirmed, but I am putting my money on an dopey-faced ermine.

Of the new strategy game demos I've spotted so far, the one that interests me most is Calyx, in which you are at war with a mass of alien vegetation, which expands toward your base in a blossoming, suffocating avalanche of green moss and purple tendril. It seems a bit raw at the level of controls and performance, but the concept is very promising: basically, imagine if Creeper World 4 were a bit more like Ground Control. Here's a trailer.

"Found a good'un," I wrote in Slack shortly after playing Mohrta's Steam demo. "It's so rad and strange!". Well, that's the pitch, reader.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cyclopean: The Great Abyss appears to have glorious dungeon graphics but I can't say for sure because I can't get torches to work. I think your character is supposed to kindle them automatically when you venture into a dungeon - at which point the view switches, classic Ultima-style, from top-down into first-person. My character never deigns to light a torch, however. Possibly this is because, no matter how many torches I loot or buy from the underworld's infrequent traders, my character page always tells me I have none. Is my character eating them? Are they too afraid to light them and expose what those dungeons contain? Do I need to read the manual properly? Or is it just a bug?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[An unannounced "PvE Action RPG" set in one of Games Workshop's fantasy properties was apparently in development until being cancelled late last year, according to a new report from mp1st.
News of the project was pieced together by mp1st from several LinkedIn profiles belonging to former employees of studio Thought Pennies. Different sources alternately describe the project as a “multiplatform, social role-playing game" and a "fantasy live-service RPG", although it's possible these refer to different projects from the same time period.

I've just got done tearing my face away from the screen it was attached to by the glitter and amphetamine-infused superglue secreted by Mindwave's minigame barrage. The current Steam demo is a generous slice of a wonderful thing its developers describe as a "cerebral microgame frenzy". It's the sort of thing you play for five minutes before realising, not unpleasantly, that you are most definitely inside of it now. It has wrapped you all up, and it's going to be quite difficult to escape. Trailer below:

The bite-sized two-player shooter was one of our favourite games of last year, summoning the fast-paced killthrills of ancient Quake servers as much as the quickfire 1v1 scraps of the gulag in Call of Duty: Warzone. And now it has a bunch of new maps. Not content with making the powerful pew-pew 'em up completely free (WHAT), the developers have added new weapons, features and a further 30 bullet-pocked arenas. And look, an icy and divisive fan-made map of ye olde Counter-Strike appears among them.

Lumon by Mark Gomersall is a free number clicker based the fourth best television show ever made (Succession, Hannibal, Scavenger's Reign, discuss). It's not a rip-roaring videogame time or anything, but it is cute. More importantly, it's topical. More importantly, it means I get to write "Severance is back!" a bunch. It's back! It is!

It's called Total Playtime and an introductory episode 0 and a Patreon are live now. The third host is Jon Hicks, with whom you may be less familiar, but he used to be my boss and thus may be considered the 5th Beatle of RPS. Anyway, go give it a listen.

The standard practice when writing up such fan theorising is to walk you through it step by step, peeling back the layers like Inspector Clouseau. But I know that you are a busy person, so I will jam it all into a single sentence: a Twitter account purporting to be a Silksong developer has posted a tweet that seemingly predicts the Switch 2 announcement while using a profile picture of some cake taken from a recipe book that was published on 2nd April 2024 which is exactly a year before 2nd April 2025 which is the date of the Nintendo Direct teased in the Switch 2 announcement.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There’s a lot you can do with a third dimension. Texture. Nativity dioramas. Spheres. Hyper Light Breaker, in expanding from the 2D action of Hyper Light Drifter, chooses to almost entirely remake itself as a free-roaming roguelike, trading post-apocalyptic pixel art for big proc-gen vistas and even more acrobatic swordplay.
Its technical ambition, sadly, ends up undermined by the emptiness of its world, the lack of exploratory pleasure that Drifter nurtured so well, and combat that’s more faithful to the original yet doesn’t quite adapt well enough to 3D. Not to mention it has more than its fair share of early access bugs and, especially in the early stages, balancing missteps.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Three-person Danish team The Outer Zone and Frostpunk creators 11-bit studios have announced Death Howl, a very gloomy soulslike deck-builder set in a "stone-age Nordic-inspired" open world that consists of biomes with names like "the Forest of Howling Shadows". Lots of howling round these parts. 


You play a mother, Ro, whose son has been claimed by the Grim Reaper, or whatever they had instead of the Grim Reaper back then - this was, I think, prior to the invention of scythes? And cards? Anyway, while searching for Ro's son, you'll take part in grid- and turn-based battles against a regular cauldron of unspeakables, including disembodied raven heads and what appears to be a huge pair of subterranean lungs. Here's a trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Looks like Sony have caught the live service jitters. The company have cancelled two online multiplayer games, including one based on God Of War, according to a report by Bloomberg journalist Jason Schreier. Two different Sony-owned studios were recently told to stop development on their projects. One of those studios is Bluepoint, known for their work on the Demon's Souls remake. They were making the unannounced live service God Of War game, according to Schreier. The other studio is Bend, developers of open world zombie 'em up Days Gone. We don't know what they were working on, aside from the fact it was also to have a live service business model. In any case, both have been canned.

No, don't ask what my real superhero identity is. After all, knowing my secrets might expose you to the wrath of my enemies. And in any case, I don't trust you. It turns out some of you people have been keeping secrets from me, as well. You have been furtively playing superhero shooter Marvel Rivals with a keyboard and mouse adapter, which makes it look as though you're playing with a controller, so that you can take advantage of controller features such as high-sensitivity aim-assist in competitive play.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The wallpaper on my phone is of a nondescript street in Shibuya. If I hold my thumb down on the photo in my phone's gallery, it actually springs to life for a few seconds and rewinds time in the process. It shows me wobble the phone into position and take the snap: a giant crab clings to a restaurant, a lady totters towards us with a white plastic bag looped around her arm, colourful signs stacked like Legos jut out of grey, "The Body Shop" lies in the distance because of course it does.
It means a lot to me, this photo. It's the precise moment I felt excitement shoot through my chest, a pang of "I can't believe I'm back". Then the next morning, a jolt that, in hindsight, definitely altered my brain chemistry. A wave of, "I finally get to disconnect and in many ways, I get to reconnect, too".

Now the series is adopting the other dominant JRPG trend of late: remakes and remasters. Tales Of Graces f Remastered, a revision of the 2009 entry in the series, is out now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blade Chimera is a cyberpunk metroidvania from Team Ladybug, the team behind the really very good Touhou Luna Nights and Deedlit in Wonder Labyrinth. As with Deedlit - one of our favourite 'vanias - I’m drawn to it partly for the opulent real-time RPG combat, and partly because, to be very superficial, the protagonist is taller than I’m used to in games like this. Sometimes he feels too tall for the levels.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Následuje neupravovaný text zajímavého prohlášení, které vydal můj oblíbenec Varhan Orchestrovič Bauer k nové verzi slovenské hymny:


S úctou a upřímnou pokorou jsem přistoupil k aranžmá národní slovenské hymny "Nad Tatrou sa blýská" již v roce 2016. Hudebně vychází z původní lidové písně a již dávno zažité sestupné basové linky původně inspirované čardášem. V monumentální instrumentaci zaznívá důstojné a bohaté "hradní" Maestoso s výraznou smyčcovou figurací a dramatické Presto s vypjatým protihlasem tak kontrastně jako dunajské nížiny a Vysoké Tatry. Důvodem vzniku bylo hledání krásy a síly slovenské hudby s duchovním nadhledem mně tolik blízké mahlerovské angažovanosti. Velmi důležitá při tom pro mě byla noblesa a hudební kultivovanost při zachování původní písně. Nový rozměr je u mě h…]]></summary>

Nemyslel bych si, že devadesátiminutová sekvence statických fotografií s hudbou, zvukovými efekty a vyprávěním může tak dobře fungovat. (Ilča 70 %)]]></summary>

Trápení je v průběhu filmu trochu permutováno, ale jde pouze o střípky, které (záměrně?) nevytvářejí žádný dramatický celek, natož zápletku. (Ilča 50 %)]]></summary>
