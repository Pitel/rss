        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Would consider making it more like the Adventure series.
According to Sega, Sonic Frontiers is a new phase for the blue blur - with the head of Sonic Team Takashi Iizuka previously mentioning how it was the "next step" for the long-running series. The game's director Morio Kishimoto has also spoken on a number of occasions about the future of the series.
Now, in his latest round of tweets, he discussed the boost mechanic featured in Frontiers. While it was incorporated in the end, Kishimoto says he would be open to releasing a Sonic game that doesn't include boost. And while he apparently understands the benefits of the boost function, he wouldn't mind challenging the level design in the series, a bit like the Sonic Adventure series did.

I love Bob Ross. I mean, everybody loves Bob Ross, but I like to consider myself something of a superfan — I've seen every episode of The Joy of Painting, many of them multiple times, I have a collection of Bob Ross memorabilia (including a figurine that is currently on my desk), and I even dressed up as him to attend one of my sorority events when I was in college, including a curly-haired wig and fake beard. Bob Ross is a national treasure who embodies the kind of gentle, loving demeanor toward others and ourselves that I'm constantly striving to display on a deeper level, and now, I can do so in Morrowind of all places, thanks to this new mod inspired by The Joy of Painting.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The whole Strange series will be on the Switch
The tale of two brothers is making its way to Nintendo's hybrid console. Life is Strange 2 is coming to Nintendo Switch on February 2, 2023.
Confirmed today, the second numbered game in the Life is Strange series is currently up for pre-order on the Nintendo eShop.
The story of Life is Strange 2 jumps away from Arcadia Bay and into the lives of Sean Diaz and his brother Daniel. After Daniel discovers some secret telekinetic abilities in a dramatic incident, the brothers leave home and go on the road. It's an emotional story about family, as the brothers try to make their way to the border and into Mexico.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6-UEpmxrlE
Two wolves
The arrival of Life is Strange 2 also ensures that the entire series is now on the Nintendo Switch. The Life is Strange: Remastered Collection, which has both the first game and its prequel Before the Storm, arrived last year. And its third entry, Life is Strange: True Colors, hit the Switch in late 2021.
With the entire Life is Strange suite playable on Nintendo Switch, that means the supernatural adventures of all these wayward souls are portable and playable on the Switch platform. It's nice to see too, as Life is Strange 2 can feel a little overlooked compared to the other entries in the series.
While it's from the era of episodic narrative games, it looks like Life is Strange 2 includes all the episodes of the second game as well, in one package. So if this is one that you missed, or maybe you hopped on with True Colors and want to see what else the series has in store, there's another option for experiencing the Diaz brothers' story.
Life is Strange 2 hits Nintendo Switch on February 2, 2023.

My husband was determined that I take on The Lion King. It had to be the Sega Genesis version. I feel like this is almost a shared experience. I played it in my youth, and it didn’t really leave any sort of bad impression. The sprites and backgrounds were done by Disney’s animation studio, and the whole thing looks like a big-budget endeavor. It’s hard to believe how relentlessly awful it actually is.
During my last experience with it, I finally accomplished a childhood dream of making it to the part of the game where you play as adult Simba. I remember concluding that it wasn’t worth it and walking away. Surely, this is the time I’ll finally beat it.
No. It broke me. It broke my spirit.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A demo is also out right now
The SteamWorld team is setting its sights on the big city. SteamWorld Build is the newest game set in the SteamWorld setting, arriving in 2023 for PC and consoles.
Announced during today's SteamWorld Telegraph, SteamWorld Build is a city builder set in the same universe that's tied together all of Thunderful's steam-powered games.
The new city builder will see you become the architect of your own mining town, excavating the ground beneath and building a town up top. The overall goal is to dig deeper, unearth the goodies, and ultimately escape the planet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fd_ZTJtAW88
It looks similar to games like Dungeon Keeper or Dwarf Fortress, where you're balancing building a world and digging deeper with the impending dangers surrounding you. There are caves to explore, five different SteamWorld-inspired maps with secrets, and it will be controllable with either controller or mouse and keyboard.
If you want to try it out for yourself, you can do so right now too. A demo for SteamWorld Build is live right now as part of the Steam Base Builder Fest, running Jan. 23 through Jan. 30, so you can give this game a shot.
The wide, wide world of Steam
Even if city builders aren't your style, there's more SteamWorld games on the way too. While the team wouldn't go into specifics, Thunderful's Brjann Sigurgeirsson confirms there are four SteamWorld games currently in development. The team didn't discuss what those games were, but hey, that's a lot of SteamWorld.
As for SteamWorld Build, no firm date has been set yet but it is planned for both PC and console sometime this year. With a demo already available, I'm personally hoping that's sooner rather than later, as I could go for a good city builder with the wonderful theming that SteamWorld frequently gets right.

The Taiwanese company is probably better known for its desktop PCs - or its former StarCraft II team! - but they're also a solid choice when it comes to high performance, relatively good value monitors - without the RGB and heavy branding of competitors like Asus or MSI. 
In any case, one of Acer's most popular models, the Nitro XF243Y Pbmiiprx, is down to £120 at Amazon. That's a great price for a 24-in 1080p 165Hz monitor that has attracted strongly positive reviews.

The NieR: Automata anime is three episodes in, but the rollout is coming to a halt. More episodes of NieR: Automata Ver1.1a have been postponed until further notice.
In a statement on social media from the adaptation's official account, the delay is attributed to COVID-related issues.
"Due to the impact of COVID-19 on production, we have decided to postpone the broadcast and distribution of episode 4 and all subsequent episodes," reads the statement. "Information regarding the broadcast and distribution schedule for episode 4 and beyond will be announced on the official anime website and official Twitter soon."
https://twitter.com/NieRA_anime_EN/status/1616843160000385024
No further details were given on how COVID has impacted production. As noted, there also isn't an expected date for the series' return just yet. Three episodes of NieR: Automata Ver1.1a are already available on streaming sites.
For the glory of mankind
The NieR: Automata anime adaptation looks to follow the events of 2017's fantastic game, though with a few twists of its own in store. Yoko Taro has said that the Ver1.1a is affixed specifically because things are being changed around.
While NieR is certainly a series with many mysteries and lore, it looks like fans will have to wait a while longer to see the rest of what's in store. Though no return date is locked in, hopefully the COVID-related issues resolve quickly and without any impact on those making this series happen.
In the meantime, you can always take a walk down memory lane and revisit NieR: Automata. The mod that made the infamous church mystery happen might be something fun to mess around with, to keep that inner lore detective happy until more NieR anime is ready to air. Or maybe catch up on our chat with the leads behind NieR: Automata that we conducted last year, to coincide with the release of NieR: Automata on Switch.

PlayStation revealed 11 new PlayStation VR2 games back in November, including a new entry in Supermassive Games' The Dark Pictures anthology series called Switchback VR. Supermassive released Until Dawn: Rush of Blood, a PlayStation VR rail shooter, in 2016, and Switchback VR is its spiritual successor. When Switchback VR was revealed late last year, there wasn't an official release date attached to it – PlayStation just referred to it as a PSVR2 launch window title. 
Nonetheless, Supermassive Games will release Switchback VR later than expected, as it has been delayed to March 16. It's a short delay, given that PSVR2 launches on February 22, and any game in its launch window was likely due around then. As for why, Supermassive Games says…]]></summary>

Naughty Dog's PS5 remake The Last of Us Part I has skyrocketed back up the UK Charts following the premiere of its HBO live-action counterpart. The remake, which launched in September 2022, found itself sitting at the number 20 spot in the physical retail charts after sales spiked a wild 238% in just one week.
The HBO adaptation of The Last of Us premiered on the channel to record audiences, pulling in an estimated 4.7 million viewers for its first episode. The series, which stars Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey, recounts the original game's story of a world-weary man and a young girl thrust together in a journey across a dilapidated United States, its places and people torn apart by a terrifying mass fungal infection.
Elsewhere in the UK Charts, Nintendo's shiny new RPG Fire Emblem Engage debuted at No.1, making it the first new number one of 2023. Fire Emblem Engage displaced Electronic Arts' football sim FIFA 23, which has sat comfortably in the top spot for almost a month now. The remainder of the Top 10 is dominated by Nintendo Switch releases, including Animal Crossing: New Horizons, Nintendo Switch Sports, Pokemon Scarlet & Violet, and, of course, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe.

We’re mere months away from The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom’s debut on 12th May. As it is, perhaps, the biggest release on the Nintendo Switch since the console’s launch year way back, we know remarkably little about the follow-up to Breath of the Wild – a game rightly hailed as one of the best ever made. Sure, we’ve gotten three-and-a-half trailers since 2019, but they’ve given us far more questions than answers.
The most recent trailer revealed the spring release date and showed us more of Link’s new adventure. It showed him using a rune ability and gave us a brief shot of our hero gliding on some metal contraption in the air…four months ago. Since then, radio silence from Nintendo.

I Was a Teenage Exocolonist is one of those games that I kept hearing about, but it took me a minute to get around to playing it with all the amazing titles that came out last year. I know I’m a bit late to the party on this one, as the game originally came out back in August of 2022, but I’m so glad that I went back to give this one a shot. 
I went into this playthrough without knowing anything about the game and without any real expectations, and exactly one completed playthrough later, I’m absolutely in love with this title. I can’t think of any other game like it, and I can’t think of a game I’ve ever played that’s made me want to dive immediately into another playthrough right away as much as this one did.

If you haven't seen the news yet, Thunderful unveiled SteamWorld Build earlier this evening, the next entry in their genre-hopping series of games about colourful robot pals trying to make their way in the world. As the name implies, this one's a citybuilder, and I've been hands on with an early build of, err, Build, to tell you all about it. No, I'm not sure what's going on with the previously announced Headhunter right now either, but in some ways, I'm glad it's Build that's coming out first. 
After all, it's been a hot minute since the last SteamWorld game came out, and Build is shaping up to be the perfect reintroduction to what made this series so special. It goes right back to its roots, reframing that classic SteamWorld Dig story of mining for gold and treasure with a new, management-style eye for town-planning, while also paying homage to where it all began for these jolly old rustbuckets way, way back on the Nintendo DSi. That's right. SteamWorld Build may be a citybuilder on the surface, but down below it's a mining and tower defence 'em up - and having lost several hours to my demo build already, it's really something special.

Moving on from action, platforming, Metroidvania, and deck-building, SteamWorld Build is a city builder meets dungeon crawler. You need to build and maintain cities on the surface of the world all while mining for resources and fighting enemies underground. Thunderful says that it's a cross between SimCity and Dungeon Keeper.

After a few teasing announcements, the fine folks over at Thunderful Publishing have prepared a special broadcast to give us a glimpse into what's been going on in the SteamWorld universe.
It's been a few years now since SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech launched and even longer since the excellent SteamWorld Dig 2, so we're itching to see what Thunderful has been cooking up in the time since. Will it be a sequel, a spin-off, or something entirely new..?

With the Joy Of Painting mod, you can set up your field easel anywhere in Morrowind, daub some brush strokes on a canvas, and even flog the painting to earn a bit of cash.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Life Is Strange 2 is coming to Switch in just a couple of weeks. 
The 2019 episodic adventure game will arrive in its entirety on February 2. The five-part saga sees brothers Sean and Daniel Diaz on the run from the law after the latter’s awakened supernatural power results in the loss of a loved one. 


This news also means the entire Life Is Strange franchise will be available on Switch. 2021’s True Colors arrived a few months after its launch, and Life Is Strange: Remastered Collection, which bundles the first title and the Before the Storm prequel, hit the hybrid console last September.
In our review, former editor Joe Juba scored Life Is Strange 2 an 8.5 out of 10, writing that "Life is Strange 2 has been quietly weaving a powerful and sincere narrative experience that admirably carries on the series’ legacy."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I hope you like pins
Whenever a new first party Nintendo game creeps up, you know it's time for a physical My Nintendo reward. Whether it's a towel or a keychain (which it is in most cases!), something typically is dumped on the My Nintendo system for people to spend their points on. For Fire Emblem Engage, that physical reward is a pin set.
This is in addition to the current sweepstakes they're still running.
Here's the full description from Nintendo:
"This reward contains 16 button pins with these iconic heroes from past Fire Emblem series: Emblem Marth, Emblem Celica, Emblem Sigurd, Emblem Leif, Emblem Roy, Emblem Lyn, Emblem Eirika, Emblem Ike, Emblem Micaiah, Emblem Lucina, Emblem Corrin, and Emblem Byleth. The pin set also includes new characters from Fire Emblem Engage: Veyle, Alear, and the adorable Sommie! The reward size: 8"x 8" and each pin size is 1.5 inches."

Pin set price points typically vary, with the WarioWare set going for 500 Platinum Points (for four larger pins), and the heavy-duty Gold and Platinum point pins going for 800. If you really want these as soon as they're available (which is roughly a wait time of 1-2 weeks, sometimes more), aim for having around 1000 points as a buffer.
As a reminder, if you want physical rewards, you can find our full Platinum Point guide here, which has been updated with details on weekly missions: bookmark it for when you need quick points for a reward. A handful of points is incredibly easy to get, as that’s basically just 15 minutes with Super Mario Run, or a quick sign-on to the 3DS or Wii U 3Shop. Also remember that any shipments are bundled together, so you can pay a flat rate for multiple items instead of paying it each time. Just know that items go out of stock on My Nintendo frequently, and some are never restocked.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[World War Z is no stranger to having lots and lots of zombies, but a new mode launching tomorrow somehow stuffs even more undead into the experience with Horde Mode XL. Horde Mode has existed in World War Z for some time, and tasks players with holding down a single location as waves of zombies invade. Horde Mode XL is functionally the same, but now boosts the number of on-screen enemies to 1,000, which is the most the game has ever managed to showcase at one time. You can check out a short gameplay clip of the new mode above, which skips the first few waves to jump right to the final XL horde.
Horde Mode XL is coming for free to World War Z tomorrow, January 24, only on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. You can read our review of World War Z right here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The writer is heading for new ventures after almost two decades at BioWare
Mac Walter, a veteran of the Mass Effect series, is leaving BioWare. The longtime writer and lead on several major projects at BioWare is moving on after nearly two decades at the company.
As Walters announced on his LinkedIn page, Walters decided at the end of last year to leave BioWare. In his post, he wishes everyone at the studio well.
"These past 19 years have been a life-changing experience to say the least, and it made the choice to go very difficult," wrote Walters. "I’ve worked with so many wonderful people and had the privilege to be a part of the most amazing teams and projects. It’s hard to fathom it all, and I know I’ll be reflecting on it for years to come."
Walters doesn't confirm what his next step is just yet, but did write that "with a new year comes new adventures."
The massive effect
Walters joined BioWare in 2003, as a writer for the martial arts RPG Jade Empire. He'd then serve as a writer on Mass Effect before moving up to lead writer for Mass Effect 2 and 3, and then head to Anthem to be its narrative director.
He'd return to Mass Effect with Andromeda as its creative director, was project director of the Legendary Edition. His last role at BioWare was as Production Director for the upcoming Dragon Age: Dreadwolf.
The Dreadwolf has been fairly quiet since we got a subtitle reveal last year, with just a few teases to go on. And the next Mass Effect has had even less to go on. No release window has been set yet for either.
Meanwhile, this marks another departure for a longtime BioWare veteran, alongside others that have left over the last few years like Casey Hudson, Mark Darrah, and Matt Goldman.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Iiiiiiiiiiiit's been...
Mario Party 1 and 2 came and went late last year on the Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pack service, and since then, things have been a bit...slow going. As a reader pointed out to me this past weekend, that prior dual release was on November 2, 2022: 82 days ago as of the time of publication.
There are a few games that are currently announced and will be coming out this year, but we don't have release dates for any of them. Here's a refresher.
Here is what's coming to the Nintendo 64 Switch lineup in 2023:
1080 Snowboarding
Excitebike 64
Mario Party 3
Pokemon Stadium
Pokemon Stadium 2
Harvest Moon 64 (Japan-only)
So far, that's all we know about. Naturally, more games could be announced, and in a hypothetical situation, all of these could come out before E3: with a bigger dump arriving in the middle of the year toward the end of 2023. We could even see some sort of upgrade for the Expansion Pack service as a whole, but I wouldn't count on it.
In the meantime, this slow drip that's very typical of Nintendo retro re-releases has now become a broken faucet. Since the original launch on October 25, 2021 (has it really been over a year since the Expansion Pack came out?), Nintendo has released 21 games in the west (and 21 games in Japan, since they don't get Dr. Mario 64 and Pokemon Puzzle League).
Are you cool with it? Or would you like to see more? Or maybe you don't care because you don't even subscribe to the Switch Online Expansion Pack for this very reason!

To achieve this, and to pick himself up, he must enter Yomi, the Japanese underworld, and face off against his past in order to rise up and become a hero.

Our choices are, at best, half-chance. Each and every day the luckiest among us are afforded multiple opportunities to go left, right, straight ahead, or staying right where I am, thank you very much.

And while we never really truly know whether we stepped the right way at the litany of crossroads we've reached, we hope that our sixth sense at best and blind luck at worse will see us through to our goals.

Forspoken is a game about movement and running. Protagonist Frey begins the game running from the law and debt collectors. She's also in the middle of a plan to flee New York City with a gym bag full of cash. Amidst that chaos, she falls into the land of Athia and is eager to leave the new, mysterious world where she inexplicably has superhuman combat and running abilities. Getting from one place to another is Forspoken’s high point, and while no other element quite reaches the heights of how fun running and climbing are, Frey’s adventure isn’t without its highlights.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Despite rumors claiming otherwise, 343 Industries will continue to develop Halo games following Halo Infinite. 
Microsoft laid off 10,000 people last week amidst the company's ongoing $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard. The same day, Halo Infinite creative director Joseph Staten, who joined the studio in 2020 to help bring the game across the finish line, revealed that he was departing 343 Industries to rejoin Xbox Publishing. Some saw this as a final blow of sorts to Halo Infinite and 343 Industries, but there's no official indication that Halo Infinite's course is changing following these layoffs. 
Still, rumors on the back of a report claimed that 343 Industries would no longer be developing Halo games, as other developers would do that in the future, while the studio served more as an overseer to the franchise. However, 343 Industries studio head Pierre Hintze was quick to get ahead of this rumor and posted the following on Twitter over the weekend: 
pic.twitter.com/03Xm3a9s59
January 21, 2023
It's a short and sweet way for Hintze to say that the reporting is false, as are the rumors, and that future mainline Halo games will continue to be developed by 343 Industries, which has developed Halo 4, Halo 5: Guardians, and Halo Infinite.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since the release of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II, players have asked for a Hardcore Mode, which was notably absent from the game at launch and still today. Developer Infinity Ward has revealed that Hardcore will hit the game during its upcoming Season 2, which begins next month. 
This news comes just a few days after Infinity Ward revealed some details about this forthcoming season, including the return of Resurgence in Warzone 2.0, Ranked Play, new multiplayer modes, maps, and weapons, and more. Other changes include making the gulag in Warzone 2.0 a 1v1 fight now, instead of 2v2 like it's been since launch, and loot from fallen enemies in Warzone 2.0 will now float on the floor, rather than remain inside a backpack. Many of these changes are welcome, but it's clear the return of Hardcore is the most exciting update coming to Season 2. 
No HUD? No problem. Hardcore is back!
January 22, 2023
Infinity Ward's tweet announcing the news already has more likes – nearly double – than the rest of the tweets that reveal Season 2 information. As for what Hardcore will look like in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, that remains a mystery, but if "no HUD" is any indication, it'll be the classic Hardcore mode fans have come to love over multiple Call of Duty titles. For the unitiated, Hardcore mode typically includes no HUD, significantly quicker deaths, and more, making for an all-around more difficult deathmatch-type game mode. 
While waiting for Season 2 to begin next month, read Game Informer's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II review.

Thankfully, there’s not much more info beyond its existence, so at least the extra ending isn’t ruined and you’ll be able to find out what it means for yourself.

Whatever your view is on 2002's Super Mario Sunshine, we reckon most would agree that the Flash Liquidizer Ultra Dousing Device - or "F.L.U.D.D." for short - was an excellent addition to the franchise that made for some truly unique gameplay mechanics.
Since then, of course, Mario has been into space, trekked across a vast desert, strolled down the streets of New Donk City, and turned himself into a spring, a frog, a Tyrannosaurus rex, and more. Yet there's still hope among Sunshine fans that perhaps F.L.U.D.D might make another appearance in a 3D Mario game. Until then, however, this mod from JustKant might be the closest we'll get for quite some time (thanks, GoNintendo).

Donkey Kong has had some fantastic animal companions over the years, and when Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze breezed onto the Wii U, and later Switch, it brought back with it a very small selection of animal companions. But in an interview published in the latest issue of Retro Gamer (via Nintendo Everything) creative director Vince Joly revealed the team at Retro Studios almost brought back a fan favourite — Enguarde the Swordfish.
Tropical Freeze only brought back Squawks the Parrot and Rambi the Rhinoceros, with the Switch version also adding a brand new parrot in Tawks to the mix, and it was the team's desire to keep the game close to the previous entry, Donkey Kong Country Returns, that stopped them from adding more in.

Well folks, it's happened: FIFA 23 has finally been knocked off its throne by none other than Fire Emblem Engage, the latest entry in the tactical RPG franchise from Intelligent Systems.
Its debut marks the second biggest launch in the series to date, coming in ahead of the 3DS fan-favourite Fire Emblem: Awakening, but behind its Switch predecessor Fire Emblem: Three Houses. According to GamesIndustry.biz, Engage's boxed sales were 31% lower than Three Houses, but obviously keep in mind that digital sales - for which Nintendo doesn't provide figures - have made considerable strides since 2019.

This weekend is the annual Granblue Fantasy Fes event in Japan, and as usual, we’re getting some big announcements from the world of Granblue. Specifically, Granblue Fantasy: Versus is getting an expansion that’s launching worldwide this year. Granblue Fantasy: Versus Rising will feature new stages, new characters, and a new story for players to experience. As you can see in the Versus Rising trailer below, it’s confirmed the game will have rollback net code and crossplay between PS4/PS5 and PC via Steam.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ln58g217C4
Skimming through the game's website, it's confirmed that all 24 characters from the original game will return for this semi-sequel. Additionally, anybody who missed out on Versus will be able to experience an abridged version of that game's celebrated story mode. If you play a lot of Versus online, know that the online lobby will be completely revamped for Versus Rising and will include the all-new "Grand Bruise Legends" mini-game mode.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOVAZg3QJF0
I guess calling it "Granblue Fall Guys" would have been a little too on the nose. Either way, all of that looks great, and it's nice to know that Street Fighter 6 will have some competition this year. Expect Cygames and Arc System Works to reveal more details and new features as we get closer to its launch date. Granblue Fantasy: Versus Rising will release worldwide this year for PS4, PS5, and PC via Steam. And if you're still playing the original Versus, know that the final update for that game will release on January 24.

Good morning, friends, and welcome to a particularly chilly edition of Whatcha Been Playing. I don't know how things are looking in your neck of the woods. But here in Blightly it's damn cold. I know it's January and everything, but even by winter standards the chill factor is through the rough... or is that through the floor? Either way, I'm walking around my house wrapped in a blanket, only turning the heating on as A Special Treat in the evening. Fuck the Tories.
Still, I'm happy to see you here, you can heat up my cold, cold heart simply by being a part of our weekly gathering. I hope that the week has been good to you, and that this weekend will give you the chance to grab a hold of some time for yourself.

In the magazine business, the Back Page is where you'd find all the weird goofs that we couldn't fit in anywhere else. Some may call it "filler"; we prefer "a whole page to make terrible jokes that are tangentially related to the content of the mag".

We don't have (paper) pages on the internet, but we still love terrible jokes — so welcome to our semi-regular feature, Back Page. Today, with the Super Mario Bros. Movie looming in the not-too-far future, we pondered what it would be like if Mario had his own sitcom...

The two games made their Nintendo debut last week, meaning the modern trilogy of Persona games are now all available on the console. It's been a long time coming for Persona fans, who have been begging to see all three games on the Switch — and P3P on consoles — for years. But, here's the real question: was it worth the wait?

Fire Emblem Engage, Intelligent Systems’ latest tactical RPG extravaganza, has finally arrived on Switch and we reckon it’s a bit of a banger, with our recent review handing it an 'Excellent' 9/10 score.
As is tradition with this long-running franchise, the tactical action here is very much of the easy-to-learn, difficult-to-master variety, with multiple layers of options and tactics that can be employed in order to rout the corrupted armies that Alear and company face in their attempts to defeat the evil Lord Sombron.

The statement was released in response to rumours that 343 would instead take a backseat on future Halo games by serving to manage external studios, rather than developing the games themselves as they had on Halo Infinite.

That's mainly because it counted Final Fantasy composer Nobuo Uematsu and art director Hideo Minaba among its developers.

Granblue Fantasy: Relink is set in the same universe and has the same Final Fantasy vets involved, but it's a big, splashly 1-4 player action RPG blockbuster, with combat reminiscent of some Platinum Games. You'll find the latest trailer below.

Of all the art styles in video games, none has a stronger chokehold on developers and players alike than the humble pixel. Whether it's a fantastically detailed modern take on what is possible in pixels, or something made in homage to NES and SNES games of yore, pixel art can be found everywhere — in every genre of game, on every console (no matter how powerful), and in every generation of games, too.
Some may dismiss pixel art as an old-fashioned art style , but the games in this list show that pixel art can be up there with some of the most beautiful games on Switch. Just because something adheres to an evident grid doesn't mean it can't be utterly gorgeous — so let's celebrate the best pixel art in games!

Heroes get a lot of love. The main character of a game is, by their very nature, the star of the show. But a great villain is often even more compelling than a great hero - everyone wants to save the world, but it takes a special soul to want to destroy it.
It's almost impossible to whittle a list of iconic video game villains down to just ten. It would be easy to simply point to the villains from games that sold really well, but that's not really what it means to be iconic. So I tried my hardest to compile a list of ten video game villains who are real icons; the ones who stand tall in the world of gaming, whose silhouettes are enough to send shivers down your spine.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tanks for the Memories
Once again, retro-lovin' publisher Hamster is reaching into the past of legendary studio Namco for another addition to its massive Arcade Archive range — This week sees the arrival of one of the developer's lesser-known '90s hits, Tank Force, now available to download on PS4 and Nintendo Switch.
Released to the arcade market in 1991, Tank Force is the third release in Namco's unofficial "Tank Battalion" trilogy — preceded by Tank Battalion (1980) and Battle City (1985). This multi-directional shooter sees up to four players battle it out in top-down, caterpillar-rolling action. A total of seven different tanks are available, all featuring their own respective traits and weapons, and a massive arsenal of 15 weapons and power-ups can be picked up to turn the tide of battle in your favor.
Check out the warfaring action in the video below, courtesy of YouTuber VideoGaming4U.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsRkKaIYdYo&ab_channel=VideoGaming4U
Featuring maze-like maps, destructible environments, land hazards, and winner-takes-all gameplay, Tank Force can be seen as something of an alternate to multiplayer hits such as Irem's cutesy hit Bomberman, though it obviously lacks the charm and charisma of the Hudson Soft series. Tank Force would not be ported to the home market of the 1990s, though it would make a reappearance as part of a number of Namco classic compendiums. Today, Tank Force's dynamic, score-attack-based gameplay has helped attract a niche but devoted community, still chasing those '90s high-score dreams.
Tank Force is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at around $8.

You might have thought about playing through The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild one last time before the arrival of Tears of the Kingdom, but how about another 50 times instead? That's what a speedrunner known as 'Player 5' recently did, and to top it off - it was achieved in under 24 hours. In fact, you can watch the whole stream on replay via Twitch.
As highlighted by GamesRadar+, the quickest run was 24 minutes and 16 seconds. This was done with the help of a variety of skills and tricks, and on average each run was about 25 minutes. Upon completion, Player 5 smiled and that was that - arguably the greatest speedrun since the launch of the action-adventure game in 2017. Player 5 is also known for previously setting a 'world record' BOTW speedrun - completing the game in 25 minutes and 23 seconds.

If you’re like me, the question on your mind is, “What are we doing here?” Not in an existentialist sense, but rather, why is this not Persona 3 FES? Why the PSP version? Unlike the philosophical question of our purpose, there probably is a good answer for why we’re getting Persona 3 Portable instead of one of its console kin, but we don’t really know it. There have been theories about the Persona 3 FES code being a mess or having been lost, but that’s exactly what I hear every time there’s a poor or missing port. Then there’s the rumor that Persona 3 is being remade, which I also doubt, but maybe.
In any case, here we are: Persona 3 Portable on console and PC.

When it comes to ways that The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild flipped the script for the wider series, there is a list of 'em so long that it almost rivals the number of those darn Korok Seeds out there. *shakes fist to the sky* One of the changes that we almost can't believe actually happened, however, was the sheer number of weapons at your disposal and how, importantly, they had a nasty habit of breaking.
This wasn't you're daddy's Zelda game. You're not picking up a sword from your uncle, a mysterious man in a cave, or a hidden chest surrounded by a maze of boulders. Instead, your first steps into the Great Plateau and beyond probably saw you armed with a couple of branches and an old wooden lid as a makeshift shield. Chances are that after a couple of swings at some nearby Bokoblins, those sticks broke and you were left pushing that stamina wheel to its limits in a crazed game of cat and mouse not a million miles away from Hyrule's take on The Benny Hill Show (or Scooby-Doo, if you'd prefer).

January has felt like a long one, we'll admit, but we are almost at the end of it now and we have Nintendo's first big release of 2023 to show for it! After all the character profiles, gameplay trailers and developer interviews, Fire Emblem Engage is finally here in all of its tactical glory.
In recognition of the gaming year starting to get underway, we asked you lovely lot to rank the Fire Emblem games that are available in the west. We also hopped on the ol' soapbox once again, this time chatting about our desire for a Paper Mario-style Zelda game and pleading for a Baten Kaitos remake (spurred on by some recent rumours). It's also been a big week for reviews as we gave our thoughts on Fire Emblem Engage, Persona 3 Portable and Persona 4 Golden amongst others.

The boiler is gone in my house, so I'm wearing one of those giant hoodie things that comes down to my knees, and scuttle about the place secreting foodstuffs in the pouch. Wait, that's more like a kangaroo, isn't it. Curses! Regardless, I will only be able to warm my hands this weekend by cupping them over the light of my PC screen.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Inflation affects yet another title
Factorio is one of those games that came out a good while ago, but I hear about it everywhere now, as it's continued to gain steam and further garner a player base as the years have gone on. The base-building strategy game originally came out on Steam in 2016, and its continued success just speaks to some solid game design, if you ask me. Now, seven years later, developers Wube Software have announced that Factorio will be receiving a price increase from $30 to $35 on Steam, and have cited inflation as the explanation for the change.
https://twitter.com/factoriogame/status/1616388275169628162
The game originally cost $20 when it was in early access on Steam in 2016, and the price increased to $30 with the release of version 1.0 in 2020. This change goes into effect on January 26, 2023, as per the tweet from Wube. The developers also added a comment to their Steam page that reads, "We don't have any plans to take part in a sale or to reduce the price for the foreseeable future" -- and this message is in place before the price increase hits.
Wube's announcement comes in the wake of tons of other inflation-driven price hikes, whether they're for other games, consoles, or streaming services. This is the first I've yet to see of a well-known indie game increasing their price (we've seen this in the AAA space for a while now with the new $70 standard), but I have a feeling it's a trend that's gonna catch on.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Avast, ye! An update is here!
It always makes me happy to see Sea of Thieves in the news — it's one of those games that I think has a great premise and always delivers on the fun, and it's managed to live on despite threats of a shutdown in 2022. The game is not only alive now, but thriving — evidenced yet again by announced a new update for 2023 that Rare announced this week. This release will focus on matchmaking improvements, as well as the addition of Pet Rocks and a brand new live event called The Secret Wilds. It's always been exciting to be a pirate, but now, even more so.
The Secret Wilds event will take over right where the previous PvE event The Rogue's Legacy left off, which explored the backstory of an undead pirate named Captain Briggsy. The event will run from January 18-February 2, so players will have a few weeks to delve further into the mystery.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XresgzEZaT0
Sea of Thieves is also getting a whole host of new cosmetics, including the "Labyrinth Looter" set of outfits, guns, and ship accessories themed around the Greek myth of Theseus and the Minotaur. There's also a new emote that has players playing with their very own Pet Rock — I guess if you can't have a parrot, a rock is the next best thing.
Arguably the most exciting changes, however, come in the form of improvements to the game's PvP mode, especially when it comes to its matchmaking systems. In an attempt to make queue times shorter, Rare is introducing a system that will pair players with an opponent from the same faction if load times are too long to make sure that players will always be able to get into a game. In addition, Rare is also increasing the number of PvP arenas from six to 50, and the losing crew in a battle will receive more compensation as an effort to make losses less bothersome. Make sure to check out the Sea of Thieves news video for more info!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The League of Legends developer is among the tech layoffs this week
Riot Games, the company behind games like League of Legends and Valorant, has laid off 46 employees. These cuts arrive in a week full of layoffs at companies across the video game and tech industry.
According to a report from journalist Jacob Wolf, the layoffs are largely focused on talent acquisition, recruiting departments, and its publishing arm, though the esports and support units were also affected. The 46 layoffs account for less than one percent of Riot, which currently sits at over 4,500 worldwide employees.
In a statement to Wolf, Riot Games says it "implemented strategic shifts within a few teams to sharpen [its] focus in a number of areas."
"With these shifts, certain roles were eliminated, impacting a total of 46 Rioters," said a Riot spokesperson in a statement to Wolf. "This is part of our normal course of our business: We periodically make changes to our structure and our teams based on what we believe will allow us to deliver the best content and experiences for players. We never make these decisions lightly and will always start from a place of wanting to retain Rioters and have them focus on our highest priorities. While that’s not always possible, it’s our primary goal."
Riot Games will continue to hire, with a number of available positions posted on its website.
Ongoing industry layoffs
These cuts arrive amidst a week full of industry layoffs, at many video game and tech companies. Microsoft recently confirmed it will be laying off 10,000 workers, with reports including cuts at Xbox studios like 343 Industries. Amazon has also initiated a round of job cuts that look to include around 18,000 people, and Google parent company Alphabet is cutting 12,000 jobs.
Vox Media is also laying off a chunk of its workforce, and Fandom has cut a number of roles as well, including those at fellow media outlets GameSpot and Giant Bomb.

At this point, Donkey Kong might be the Game Boy’s worst-kept secret. At the time of its release in 1994, I didn’t hear much about it. The fact that it’s just called Donkey Kong makes it sound like a port of the original arcade title, and it seems willing to keep that illusion going. There was also a push to make it the poster child of the Super Game Boy, which seemed to further muddy the waters. But if you took a chance on it, you’d find that it’s not only a terrific game in its own rig…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It was HBO's second-biggest premiere in 13 years
Let's be honest — we all knew HBO's The Last of Us adaptation was going to be popular, it was just a matter of quite how popular it would turn out to be. As expected, it was a massive success, and a tweet from HBO Max confirmed it: the show surpassed 10 million viewers within two days of its premiere, and that only accounts for the viewers in the United States, according to HBO. Those numbers are broken down into 4.7 million streams on premiere night last Sunday, January 15, which means an additional 5.3 viewers tuned in the following day. I'd bet a good percentage of those people saw the hype online and wanted to see what all the fuss was about, because the series has lit up social media like the Fourth of July this week.
https://twitter.com/Variety/status/1615795010540302338
With numbers like that, The Last of Us has secured a spot as the second-most watched premiere of a show on HBO since 2010, second only to House of the Dragon with 9.98 million viewers. While The Last of Us had the benefit of a pre-built fanbase of gamers to flock to the streaming platform on opening night, House of the Dragon had the advantage of being a spin-off of another one of HBO's most successful series of all time: Game of Thrones.
HBO has also stated that numbers tend to grow significantly in the weeks after a show has premiered, with only 20-40% of its total numbers coming from Sunday night viewership. This means The Last of Us can be expected to be seeing even bigger numbers as time goes on, and as a fan of the series myself, I can imagine it's only a matter of time before even the most hardened skeptics cave to the curiosity — especially when it comes to seeing the adaptations of the show's most iconic scenes that are still ahead.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Survive through space horror, again
If you wanted a reason to play back through a late 2022 game again this weekend, The Callisto Protocol just got one. Striking Distance Studios released a new update for The Callisto Protocol last night that includes New Game+.
After updating to the most recent patch, players who have beaten the game should have access to the New Game+ mode. You'll need an active save file from finishing the game, and you might need to restart The Callisto Protocol to see it. With New Game+, you can carry over all your weapons, upgrades, and Callisto Credits from your previous run.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IT7swHyN8FQ
Alongside the new mode, there's also a number of updates to the game itself. General performance optimizations have been made across all platforms, and multiple issues where camera angles or paths could cause the player to fall through the ground have been fixed.
Players should also no longer take damage when vaulting over obstacles, making the environment a little less of an enemy. Other crash areas for specific platforms have been addressed, too. You can find the full patch notes on The Callisto Protocol subreddit here.
And now you're back, from outer space
The debut survival horror game from Striking Distance Studios has been gradually patching up its game since launch. The Callisto Protocol had some notable launch issues, some of which we experienced ourselves during our review process.
It's been nice to at least see some of the technical issues get addressed alongside new options like New Game+ rolling out. If you're someone who's wanted to do a second run through the space-jail horror experience, this seems like a good reason to do so.
Striking Distance was also the subject of a recent report, where several former developers alleged their names were left off the credits for the game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Physical edition fans, rejoice!
In a time when digital media can disappear out of thin air with nothing but the blink of an eye from a jaded executive, I think it's more than fair that some fans prefer to own physical copies of their favorite media, including games. Fans of The Witcher 3 who want to have the game available in physical form for their PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X are in luck, because CD Projekt Red is releasing The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt - Complete Edition in the European and North American regions next week on January 26.
https://twitter.com/witchergame/status/1616406686734110723
The Complete Edition will of course include the base game, as well as the game's previously released DLCs, Blood and Wine and Heart of Stone. This edition will also come along with the the recent next-gen update that the game received in December, which mainly focused on quality-of-life changes, as well as extras like a new quest, a photo mode, cross-platform progression, new outfits inspired by The Witcher's Netflix series, and more.
What's more, we also got news that CD Projekt Red is also working on some improvements to the next-gen PC version of the game, which is in desperate need of a patch when it comes to performance issues. These problems have persisted after a hotfix patch from the studio, and experts have suggested that the game will need a more intensive overhaul in order to run more smoothly on the PC platform.

Load up on paint, and bring your friends, as Nintendo has released its hefty Version 2.1.0. update for its messy multiplayer shooter Splatoon 3. Now available to download on Nintendo Switch, the new patch brings a laundry list of balance tweaks, bug fixes, U.I. polishes, and much more.
It's difficult to know where to start when an update has this much coverage... There has been an array of buffs and nerfs to many tools in the Splatoon 3 arsenal, from damage, to spread, to ink consumption, to fire rate. The Dynamo Roller, Jet Squelcher, Sloshing Machine, Aerosprays MG & RG, and Nautilus 47 have all been tweaked, for better or worse, while sub-weapons and gear skills such as Angle Shooter and Ninja Squid have also seen minor overhauls.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Everyone's favorite overseer
Good Smile Company has added another iconic video game character to its classy Figma figurine range — This time, it's the turn of the charming if unnerving overseer of The Nexus, Demon's Souls' esteemed and much-loved overseer: The Maiden in Black.
The sweet demon stands a little over six inches in height, and is sporting the trademark poseability that is a key feature of all Figma models. This allows the Maiden in Black to be posed in a variety of demure and evocative stances, bringing a sense of morose disquiet to anybody's bookshelf or work desk. The maiden comes packaged with a selection of alternate hands, as well as her huge, path-lighting torch. Three variants of her skirt are included, in order to facilitate both sitting and standing poses.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThazDMOKDyY&ab_channel=MAXFACTORYCHANNEL
A rarity for the Figma format, Good Smile Co. has released a video of our girl, perhaps aware of the maiden's mammoth fan base and the likelihood that she will be one of the more popular Figmas.
If you would like to invite The Maiden in Black Figma into the warmth of your home, then you can pre-order her right now over at the official Good Smile Co. store and other import retailers. The Maiden retails for ¥12,800 (or roughly $93 USD) not including shipping or any potential custom charges. Unfortunately, it will take her a long time to make her way from The Nexus to your house, as global shipping is not expected until January 2024. Still, what a wonderful guest to ring in the new year.
Demon's Souls is available now on PS5.

Video game adaptations are more popular than ever, especially when it comes to the games-to-TV/film side of things — just look at the endless conversations surrounding HBO’s adaptation of The Last of Us. Last year I wrote a list of my dream TV shows based on game franchises, and now that some of those are actually coming true, I thought it was high time to flip things around the other way and bring about even more manifestation.
Although they had a heyday in the early-to-mid 2000s in the form of licensed shovelware, TV-to-game adaptations are few and far between as of late — but that doesn’t mean there aren’t some awesome IPs that would make for some killer adaptations into video games.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's eight available now
The Switch Online icon system gets periodic updates, often focusing on evergreen games like Animal Crossing or Mario, as well as individual newish releases. The time has finally come for Fire Emblem icons, and the changes have been rolled out as of this week. Let's take a look at what you can actually pick up.
[gallery link="file" columns="2" size="large" ids="358997,358996"]
Here are all the Fire Emblem Engage My Nintendo icons coming in the first wave:
Alear (type 1) - 10 Platinum Points
Alear (type 2) - 10 Platinum Points
Clanne - 10 Platinum Points
Framme - 10 Platinum Points
Vander - 10 Platinum Points
Lumera - 10 Platinum Points
Marth - 10 Platinum Points
Celica - 10 Platinum Points
Libération (Alear's sword) - 10 Platinum Points
Sommie (the hub world pet) - 10 Platinum Points
Five backgrounds and five frames are also available.
All of these icons comprise "Wave 1" (implying more are on the way), and they'll be available until January 26. In fact, this tweet from the Fire Emblem Japanese account hard confirms more waves (six total). Out of this lot, I suspect Marth will be one of the most-purchased icons; as well potential classic cast members via the Emblem Ring system. That could mean icons for Roy, Ike, Byleth, and tons of other iconic characters.
Remember, to pick these up, you just need to go to the "Switch Online" icon at the bottom of the Switch home screen, then go to "missions and rewards."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With all the Sad Dad™ games that have cropped up in recent years, many have rightfully been asking: "Where are all the video game mums at?". Well, what if I told you that Swedish indie studio Might and Delight have been putting mums at the centre of their games since 2013? Yup, elephant mums in Shelter 3, Lynx mums in Shelter 2, and the OG badass badger mum in Shelter 1. Sure it’s kinda terrible that the only major rep mums are getting in video games is in the form of Might and Delight’s animal tales, but I’ll honestly take any story about motherhood I can get my paws on.
As much as I love Shelter 2 (less so Shelter 3, unfortunately), Shelter 1 holds a special place in my heart, mostly because no other animal-focused survival game has come even remotely close to claiming the coveted title of "most brutal animal sim that made me ugly cry."

Relics Of The Old Faith was shown off a bit at the end of 2022, but this is the first we’re hearing of another arriving later in this sparkly new year.

You steer your wee boat around a grounded anime age-of-sail Earth, looking for shipwrecks and treasures, fighting pirates (and possibly being one, although fairly peripherally),exploring, trading, and doing the usual Elite-style open world thing. I'll be honest: I don't exactly love this one, and it's spread a little thin. But I've played it for hours longer than I expected and enjoyed it more as it went on. It's doing a lot, in its own slightly roundabout way.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We concluded 2022 by returning to our Super Replay roots by tackling an old-school survival horror game. That means replaying one of the greatest games of the PS1 era, Silent Hill! 
In 1999, Konami put the fear of fog in a generation of players with the release of Silent Hill. The eerie title eschewed the more bombastic horror of its main rival at the time, Resident Evil, in favor of more psychological frights. Protagonist Harry Mason must embark on a terrifying search for his missing daughter, Cheryl, within the eerie town of Silent Hill. What unfolds is a descent into madness that kickstarted a franchise that's (finally) returning to the limelight after years of dormancy. Join me, Marcus Stewart, along with Kyle Hilliard, as we survive Silent Hill’s debut adventure and see how its scares stack up 23 years later. Check out the full series in the header above or by clicking the links below. 
Episode 1 - The Harry Mason Shuffle
Episode 2 - When Doves Cry
Episode 3 - Bible.
Episode 4 - Age Seven, Short, Black Hair
Episode 5 - Map Daddy
Episode 6 - The End is Neigh

This is how I started playing the free prologue demo for Die In The Dungeon, a turn-based roguelike where you place dice on a grid to slice and , er, dice your foes. It’s smart, concise, and I can’t stop playing.
Playing as your little green knight, you are given five dice each round to place on a game board. Each one represents a certain action, the basic ones being attacking and defending, but ramping up to mass healing and boosting the stats of other dice. Energy points dictate how many dice you can place on the board, with each one costing the number on its face. Placement is key, as different combinations can lead to better outcomes like, for example, how you can place an attack die in a space affected by a booster die to up its damage.

And, oh, my heart, the post-game blues are real!
I was extremely late to the party when it comes to Capcom's long-running series of legal dramedy visual novels, which debuted all the way back in 2001. But I found my way here in the end, largely thanks to the aforementioned collection, which packages prettied-up versions of the original Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trilogy and its prequel duology The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles onto modern systems.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As announced in a recent blog post, 13 new games are coming to PlayStation VR2, and they’re all expected to release “within one month of the February 22 launch.” They are as follows:
Before Your Eyes
Kayak VR: Mirage
Pavlov VR
Puzzling Places
Song in the Smoke: Rekindled
Synth Riders: Remastered Edition
Thumper
NFL Pro Era
What the Bat?
Rez Infinite
Tetris Effect
Creed Rise to Glory: Championship Edition
The Last Clockwinder
The blog post also mentions that Gran Turismo 7 will receive a free VR2 update on launch day. A statement from the president of Polyphony Games details that “While 2-player splitscreen races are not supported in VR, all other races, including online races, will be available.” In case you missed it, Resident Evil Village will also get a VR update on launch day.
This list of 13 joins the existing lineup of 11 VR games PlayStation announced last November and the six games announced in December. Combined with other previously announced titles, like Horizon: Call of the Mountain, PlayStation VR2 will have over 30 games available to play within a month of launch.
PlayStation VR2 is set to come out on February 22, just over a month from today. A few months ago, we learned that the base model will cost $549.99, with the option to bundle it with Horizon Call the Mountain for an additional $50.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A Ubisoft game known as Project Q leaked early last year before the Assassin's Creed maker revealed its existence, calling it a team-based battle arena combat game. 
Insider Gaming reported yesterday that Ubisoft had canceled Project Q and now, Ubisoft has confirmed that this is, in fact, true to Video Games Chronicle. 
"We can confirm we will no longer support the development of Project Q in order to focus on priority projects, to which our teams are being reallocated," Ubisoft told VGC. 
This cancelation comes after Ubisoft delayed Skull and Bones last week alongside news that it had canceled three unannounced games. It's currently unclear if Project Q was one of those three games canceled (while Project Q was technically announced, it was revealed as an in-the-works project rather than a game with a final title so perhaps Ubisoft considered it unannounced).

Revealed at the Game Awards back in 2020, the trailer boasted a whole load of activities: sailing, climbing, ukelele playing, swimming, tree-hopping, slingshot sharpshooting, totem carving, gliding - the list is never ending - and all set on a beautiful island with characters to talk to, quests to complete, and enemies to fight. And on top of all that, you also have the ability to "soul-jump" letting you control any animal or object.
It sounds too good to be true, right? But two years after Awaceb's trailer debut, I’ve gotten my hands on a preview build to see whether a nine-person dev team’s tropical island exploration game is pie in the sky. Turns out, it’s the opposite; my hands on time suggests Tchia will deliver on everything it promised and more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pokémon Scarlet and Violet arrived on Switch last November, and the Pokémon Trading Card Game is ready to leave Galar for the open world of Paldea. That first Scarlet and Violet expansion arrives this March (alongside various changes, including a price increase), but first, we have one more Sword and Shield expansion to get to.
Pokémon Trading Card Game: Sword & Shield – Crown Zenith, out this week, adds more than 160 new cards, including 3 new Radiant Pokémon, five Pokémon VMax cards, eight Pokémon VStar cards, and 70 cards with special Galarian Gallery artwork. The Pokémon Company sent over some of the products in this special expansion, and we cracked them to see what we could pull.
Though I'm frustrated you can't buy these as individual booster packs (they're only available in larger packs like the Elite Trainer Box and special collections), I absolutely love several of the cards I pulled. In particular, the full-art cards are absolutely striking. I'm very happy with the Radiant Charizard, and the Pikachu and Lucario cards might be among my favorites of those respective Pokémon. You can see the full gallery below.

Pokémon Trading Card Game: Sword & Shield – Crown Zenith arrives starting on January 20 with the Elite Trainer Box and Collections starring Regieleki V or Regidrago V. New Tins and Collections will arrive through May. For all things Pokémon Trading Card Game, head to our special hub by clicking the banner below!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft has laid off 10,000 employees. 
This news comes from a Bloomberg report detailing that Microsoft's layoff come as the company attempts to reduce costs amid a larger economic slowdown. These layoffs come amidst Microsoft's ongoing fight against the FTC to acquire Call of Duty makers Activision Blizzard for a staggering $69 billion. Bloomberg reports that some people at Bethesda Game Studios, which is hard at work on getting Starfield ready for its release sometime in the first half of this year, were laid off, but that Halo Infinite developer 343 Industries was hit hardest in the company's portfolio of game studios. 
According to Bloomberg, Microsoft has plans to hire in "strategic, competitive areas" like AI but that other tech-focused departments like HoloLens and some engineering divisions were hit by these layoffs. 
Microsoft has not yet revealed exact numbers and specific departments surrounding this massive wave of layoffs. Another tech giant, Amazon, is in the middle of its own string of layoffs as the company aims to reduce its workforce by 18,000. 
The hearts of Game Informer's staff are with all those who were affected by these layoffs.

That's the case today with this deal on a 32GB dual-channel kit of DDR5-6000 from TeamGroup, specifically their T-Force Delta RGB RAM. It's been reduced from its ridiculous launch MSRP of $339.99 down to $149.99, a great price for this spec and especially for a kit that comes equipped with RGB lighting.

Alternatively, you can try out this fan-made Elden Ring Geoguessr-inspired game that plonks you into a random bit of the map and scores you based on how close you can drop a pin to your true location. If Rings aren't your thing LostGamer.io has maps from other games, too, including Skyrim and Fortnite. It's a lovely idea.

Everyone has something they loved spending time with in the past – a restaurant, a daily-play video game, a group of friends – only to one day unknowingly enjoy doing so for the final time. It's a poignant and often heartbreaking truth of how places evolve, tastes change, and priorities divert as we all grow older. For the eponymous hero in Lil Gator Game, that activity is live-action role-playing with his big sis. With his sister home from college, Gator assembles a master plan to pry her away from her coursework for one more game. The resulting adventure is a short, cute, Zelda-in…]]></summary>

While it sits at a 60 percent critic score on Rotten Tomatoes, Sonic Prime received an 88 percent audience score, which is pretty great as far as video game TV shows go. Of course, Rotten Tomatoes doesn't account for every person that watched the series, but it's a quick look at what audiences thought. It seems Netflix is ready to answer the desire for more because the official Sonic the Hedgehog Twitter account announced today that more Sonic Prime episodes are coming later this year.

As you can see, there's not much to go on here, so it's currently unclear if these are just additional episodes or the reveal that a Season 2 is happening. Regardless, more Sonic Prime is coming to Netflix in 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Far Cry 2 is a lot of things, based on the memories I have from playing it a decade ago. First and foremost, I recall Far Cry 2: Parasitic Pain, which tasks you with running around begging for pills to stave off a growing infection. Next comes Far Cry 2: Buddy Bonanza, which lets you make lots of lovely AI friends, charge into battles together, and then hide while they die. Then, there’s Far Cry 2: Firewatch, which is all about watching fire. It's the best.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The EU have voted to push for reform in the videogame industry, backing a report that takes aim at everything from loot boxes to human rights violations tied up with gold-farming. The report includes calls for better parental control options, "harmonised rules" compelling sellers to show more information about game content, and a clamp down on third-party skin gambling.
Those are all laudable goals, but time will tell how much change this actually amounts to.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been holding something in for 5 years. It first started as a deep joy, like a ray of sunshine in the palm of my hand. Then it became a deep sense of longing for something I'd lost, like a cascade of sand that fell from my palm as I wept gently on an empty beach. The "it" is a mobile and Nintendo Switch game called Pokémon Quest (don't laugh), which was the first - and only -  mobile game I've actively obsessed over.
The game's an auto-battler where you gather a small trio from the original 150 Pokéfolks, level them up, and then tackle trickier and trickier stages. After a frankly disgusting number of hours, I'd finished all the stages. So, I thought, "Yes, of course they will add the 2nd generation of Pokéfolks with a bunch of new stages. This is its natural evolution, if you will". It still hasn't happened and probably never will. And I hate that I can't find anything else that'll replace it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Indonesian studio Mojiken have been making games for years. Most of them are less than an hour long. They're short, punchy adventures and cover everything from digital fortune tellers, violin-playing owl-men, and poetic folktales about potato-shaped forest creatures. 
A Space For The Unbound is Mojiken’s first 'big' release in that sense, clocking in at around nine-ish hours. What begins as a YA coming-of-age tale about a small-town romance quickly gains remarkable momentum, and suddenly you’re dealing with supernatural teens trying to desperately stop a world-ending calamity. Part sci-fi drama, part high school romance, A Space For The Unbound manages to have incredible weight and grandeur while also being poignant, sweet, and honest at the same time. It's a triumph.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Avalanche and publisher Warner Bros. Interactive have released a new cinematic trailer for Hogwarts Legacy, giving viewers a bird's eye view, literally, of the titular school and the surrounding castle grounds. 
With Hogwarts Legacy due out on current-get consoles and PC in just a few weeks, on February 10, it's no surprise we're getting a trailer like this today. It's a great look at what to expect in the game, including beasts and creatures, characters like Professor Weasley and Nearly Headless Nick, and more. There's even some Avada Kadavra-casting foes to be seen, as well as dragons and spiders to fights. And all of it is shown through the view of an owl delivering a Hogwarts acceptance letter to a soon-to-be wizard. 
Check out the 4K version of this Hogwarts Legacy cinematic trailer below: 


For more about Hogwarts Legacy, check out everything we learned in the second gameplay showcase, which aired last month, and then read about the latest details revealed during a Sony State of Play last year. Check out Hogwarts Legacy's PlayStation 5 DualSense features after that. Read about how controversial Harry Potter creator JK Rowling is not involved with the making of Hogwarts Legacy (although she will almost certainly be getting money as a direct result of this game) and then check out this trailer showcasing common rooms, easter eggs, and more. 
Hogwarts Legacy hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on February 10. It launches on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on April 4, and finally, the Switch version will be released on July 25.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In games it's often a delight to be proven wrong. Such as, for example, my longstanding belief that Dwarf Fortress would never make the biggest and most important change it possibly could, and fit itself with an interface fit for purpose.

Bay 12 Games have, of course, gone further than that, and released it for general sale on the biggest shop in the business after sixteen years as freeware. There's even a charming new graphics overhaul to replace the famous ASCII symbols which, depending on who you ask, might not have technically counted as "graphics" at all.
I'm not here to discuss the relative merits of this shiny new version and the "classic" version. Both will be updated in future, the latter still free, and neither expected to reach a full 1.0 release inside 20 years. All this chips around the edges of what I've been pondering, which is this: What exactly is Dwarf Fortress's place within our culture now, after a decade replete with games that looked to it for ideas?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In 2021 I reviewed Backbone, a masterpiece of 2D pixelart that was partly a point 'n' click detective noir game, and mostly a grim story-focused fever dream about collectivism. At the time I described it as "like The Good Place with more depression, or Disco Elysium with raccoons." Backbone has an ending so bizarre on a literal level that it defies description even if I wanted to spoil it. A while back developers Eggnut teased that they were working on a new game, and it turns out that game is Tails: The Backbone Preludes, a prequel that probably won't answer any questions you might've had about the ending of Backbone. It's also out very soon, on February 2nd.

Indiescovery is the new sibling in the RPS podcast family and will sit snuggly next to Ultimate Audio Bang, and The Electronic Wireless Show, but our focus is strictly on the wonderful world of indie games. It’s best to think of the podcast as an extension of our Indiescovery tag on the site - although we've got the Indiescovery Podcast tag just for the pod, if you ever want to check all the episodes. Every episode video bud Liam, guides lass Rebecca and myself (reviews ranger Rachel) will highlight a bunch of cool indies and talk about why we love them.

It included all three expansions, it made everything look great at 4K resolution, it revived the multiplayer, it remastered the beloved music...

Regardless of what kind of performance you're aiming for, you'll need a pretty beefy machine, with 24GB of RAM and an RTX 3070 required to hit those recommended specs.

Looking back, was I naïve? Yes. And was I wrong? I'm delighted to report that I was catastrophically wrong.
From what I've played so far of Persona 3, I reckon it's well worth a whirl if you're a newcomer, or a Persona 5 fan who's concerned that a game from 2009 won't be all that good. Not only does it stand on its own as a fun high school mystery with an alarmingly dark undertone, it almost acts as a fun history lesson too.

I can't even imagine how long it would take you to do a full journey across it all, but it will definitely take you longer than the two hours you'll spend in the company of Brainwash Gang's loosely connected anthology story game The Longest Road On Earth.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Persona 3 released in North America in 2007 on PlayStation 2 and was a mild hit. The dark, teen drama RPG had a niche audience, but those who found the game adored it. The game received a special edition release with added in content in 2008 with FES, and was then re-released a third time for PSP in 2010 with the most added content, but some modifications made to run on Sony's handheld platform.
Persona 4 followed – again a mild hit – but then Persona 5 came along and cemented the franchise's reputation as one of the best RPGs ever made. Fans who discovered the series with 5 have wanted to figure out what they've been missing out on, and longtime players have been demanding the re-release of 3 so that a larger audience could play what many call their favorite. After arguably too long, Atlus is finally ready to make that happen with the re-re-re-release of Persona 3 on modern consoles January 19.
Join Kyle Hilliard and Wesley LeBlanc as they look at the game's first true dungeon and chat about perhaps the most controversial Persona game in the series.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Heads up, Stadia owners: Google’s cloud gaming program is shutting down today, January 18. The service began issuing refunds for all hardware last November, but if you haven’t received one yet, information on how to obtain one should have been emailed to the Google account used to make the purchase. However, past Stadia Pro subscriptions will not receive refunds.
There's a silver lining for those of you with Stadia controllers and nothing to use them for. You can download an update that will allow your controller to use Bluetooth. However, be warned: this permanently disables wi-fi capabilities, so if you download the update now, you won't be able to play Stadia games before the shutdown. For more details, you can visit the Stadia Help Center.
Stadians, you can now update your Stadia Controller’s firmware to enable Bluetooth Low Energy connections.

January 17, 2023
If you missed the news about the shutdown, last September, Stadia’s VP and General Manager said in a blog post that “while Stadia's approach to streaming games for consumers was built on a strong technology foundation, it hasn't gained the traction with users that we expected so we’ve made the difficult decision to begin winding down our Stadia streaming service.” 
Stadia’s struggles were no secret. Its first-party studios were shut down just over a year in, with the service being “deprioritized” a year later. While it was an interesting experiment, some experiments are just destined to fail. Rest in peace, Stadia.]]></summary>

Well, three. Camp one was excited for the TV show and camp two posited that there's no point making an adaptation of something if your adaptation is just the same thing. (The third camp was "eh, I might check it out" and watched the other two camps duking it out). I was in camp two. If you're adapting something, adapt! Make changes! Otherwise I might as well just consume the original thing again! The Last Of Us has already been released, what, three times?
This was made funnier by the fact that nobody on staff had seen the TV show, so we were just arguing about tweets we'd seen that describe the show, the worst way to conduct a discussion outside of e.g. scrawling insults on the side of Teslas and self-driving them into each other's front doors. But it got me to thinking about adaptations, because there have been loads of adaptations of things that aren't games into video games. What goes wrong in the other direction?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[HBO’s TV adaptation of fungal post-apocalyptic funfest The Last Of Us debuted on streaming services on both sides of the Atlantic over the past few days, and now a follow-up trailer shows what’s coming for the rest of the show’s first season. It has plenty of cordyceps-infected baddies, gritty human drama, and Pedro Pascal being Pedro Pascal. You can watch the Weeks Ahead trailer below, and wonder where The Mandalorian’s left his helmet again.

Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty’s public demo gave players a chance to experience a more general idea of what this fast-paced action game offers, but Koei Tecmo recently gave us the chance to go deeper and play through the first two chapters in Wo Long in full. I’m starting to understand that developer Team Ninja is aiming for a wider swath of players with Wo Long as opposed to its Nioh titles, which are some of the most demanding in games. While Wo Long still features that trademark From Software-inspired challenge, it also features a unique system that allows you to change an enemy’s…]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-01-17T13:44:47.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Last of Us, the highly anticipated TV adaptation of Naughty Dog's hit game of the same name, finally premiered Sunday and it's looking like a massive hit for HBO. 
That's because The Last of Us' premiere was the second largest debut for an HBO series since 2010, beaten only by last year's House of the Dragon, the first TV spinoff from HBO's Game of Thrones series. The Last of Us drew in 4.7 million views, according to a Deadline report, coming in second to House of the Dragon's 2022 premiere which pulled in 9.986 million watchers. The Last of Us is matched by HBO's Boardwalk Empire, which premiered in 2010 to 4.81 million viewers. 
Deadline writes that HBO says Sunday night viewing usually represents 20 to 40% of a given show's gross audience per episode (HBO shows typically release episodes on Sunday nights). 
"We are thrilled to see fans of the series and game alike experience this iconic story in a new way, and we extend our gratitude to them for helping to make it a success," CEO and chairman of HBO and HBO Max Content Casey Bloys said, according to Deadline. "Congratulations to [showrunners Craig Mazin and Neil Druckmann, who is also a co-creator of The Last of Us], and the brilliant cast and crew who worked tirelessly to bring this show to life. We look forward to fans around the world enjoying the rest of the season." 
"Our focus was simply to make the best possible adaption of this beloved story for as big an audience as we could," Druckmann and Mazin said, according to Deadline. "We are overjoyed to see how many fans, both old and new, have welcomed The Last of Us into their homes and their hearts." 
While waiting for this week's episode, read our interview with Druckmann and Joel actor Pedro Pascal about how The Last of Us was changed for TV, and then read about how there are no plans for The Last of Us show to go beyond the games.

This image, which you can view in the tweet below, comes from the 4chan forum, as reported by Video Games Chronicle, which has also verified with sources that the image is real. The image appears to be Suicide Squad's start menu and features standard things like game mode selection, chapter select, difficulty, and matchmaking. It also features some menus to page through at the top, including a "Battle Pass" one. Under those top-bar menus are what appear to be various currencies, too.

The final hour or so was split into two parts, thanks to a lovely dev who time-skipped me forwards and into the game's open world, before warping me through a gate and into an early boss's lair. There was a lot to take in, from robo-gloves, to sex-dom vending machines, to grannies with bazookas.
I went in with expectations that it might be a little like BioShock, all steely and serious in its delivery of some vaguely philosophical truth. But I emerged with a totally different impression. Far from polished seriousness, Atomic Heart seems a little disjointed in its ambition, with a main character who almost immediately kills any atmosphere when he opens his mouth.

"You know how fuzzy memories can be." It's a convenient and hand-wavy line delivered by the new character Lim, warning the Straw Hat Pirates of the impending adventures into some of One Piece's most popular story arcs. Likewise, One Piece Odyssey can be a fuzzy experience. It oscillates between being thrilling and tedious. The promise of discovering "what if…?" scenarios is enticing for longtime fans, but it rarely follows through in a meaningful way.

Golf Story was one of the biggest surprises in the Switch’s extremely strong first year on the market. Thanks to Golf Story’s charming, nostalgic presentation and novel sports/RPG fusion, Sports Story has long been one of my most anticipated sequels. Unfortunately, its unfocused nature and frustrating gameplay are only overshadowed by a pervasive lack of polish that prevents Sports Story from being worth your time. 
As the name suggests, Sports Story expands the world to include other games while creating a more sweeping and ambitious story. As sports go…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Awesome Games Done Quick (AGDQ) started the New Year with a bang, raising over $2.6 million for the Prevent Cancer Foundation. For the unfamiliar, GDQ is a 24-hour charity live-stream where dedicated gamers show off speedruns of their favorite games. Before 2020, most events were held in person, but since then they've mostly been broadcasted from streamers' homes. This year's event ran from January 8-15 and included over 140 runs.

While most runners don't expect to set new records during the marathon, a whopping four were set this year for the following games: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge, PowerWash Simulator, Super Mario Galaxy 2, and Steven Seagal Is: The Final Option (Prototype). Most years have one or two records set, but four is a big deal.
2023 marks the 14th year that the biannual charity marathon has taken place. They have two main events in the winter and summer, but they also hold smaller events throughout the year. One of these is Frost Fatales, an all-women speedrunning event, which will take place from February 26 - March 4, 2023 on Twitch. Since it was founded in 2010, the organization has raised over $43 million for charity.
AGDQ was initially set to be in person but was moved online due to COVID concerns. Their summer event, Summer Games Done Quick, will be held from May 28 - June 4, though it's unclear whether the event will also take place in person.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I did not expect the next game from The Lion's Song devs Mi'pu'mi Games to be a turn-based tactical folktale, but cor, Howl sure does tick a heck of a lot of boxes for me. Due out later this year, you play a deaf hero in search of a cure to a sinister 'howling plague' that's devastated the land around you and turned all its inhabitants into blood-thirsty beasts - and having played its first chapter last week, its combination of tight planning, grid-based shoving and limited ammo a la Into The Breach is very, very moreish indeed. Definitely one to watch for strategy game fans.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At a time when LucasArts was cheerfully mocking rival developer Sierra's fondness for punishing players with game overs you could trigger at the drop of a hat, Sierra themselves seemed intent to double down. In Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers, not only can the titular protagonist suffer a variety of gruesome fates if you so much as put a foot wrong, but there's a point where you can soft-lock the entire game by failing to pick up an easily missable single snake scale from a busy crime scene — and you won't even know you did anything wrong for several in-game days. I'm not 100% sure this wasn't an oversight on the part of the developers, but at the same time, that's exactly the sort of shit that Sierra liked to pull.

I'd encourage you to have a watch of the full Minecraft Africa video, and wonder why Toto’s only other famous tune is Rosanna.

The EU's antitrust watchdog is nearing the end of a 90-day probe into whether Microsoft's buyout violates antitrust laws, and they're reportedly about to serve up a charge sheet that lays out all their beef. As with those of the FTC and other regulators, their objections are likely to centre on the likelihood of Microsoft saddling Call Of Duty with Xbox or Gamepass exclusivity.

It's a space colony city builder with a puzzle game mentality - and set on Mars to make things even more enticing. The best part of Farlanders is its story, and while it’s not quite a full-blown commentary on colonialism, it examines what you’re doing and why you’re doing it with a self-awareness that I did not expect at all. That being said, annoying difficulty curves, awkward terraforming, and frustrating progression systems stop this space colony sim from really taking off. A graph charting my enjoyment over time would look like a child’s drawing of a mountain.

You know, as video game TV shows go. I've yet to sit down and watch it myself, but I'll probably be doing so this evening to see what's what. 
A question I've been pondering in the run-up to The Last Of Us' TV debut, however, is this: if I watch the TV show now, will I really be bothered to actually sit down and play Part 1 when it finally comes to Steam at the beginning of March? 'Cause I sure don't have time (or the inclination) to do both. I think that might be too much The Last Of Us... But what about you, readers? Will you be tuning in, or waiting to play it on PC? Or both! Tell us in the comments below.

Retro platformers are not hard to come by. I count myself among the group of video game players who welcome efforts from small development teams that play to our nostalgia for an era where playing video games meant tuning to channel 3. Some are fantastic, some are too hard to be enjoyable, but most land somewhere in the middle. Vengeful Guardian: Moonrider won’t go down in history as one of the greats that both embraces the past and modernizes the action, but I would place it closer to the fantastic side of the scale, even if it doesn’…]]></summary>

This new trailer provides yet another beautiful glimpse into the painterly world of Season while providing new details about what our protagonist is doing: archiving the end of the Earth and the final people still living on it. She strives to capture their final moments in her journal and with her camera, aiming to learn why they're still around and ultimately, what kept them going. It sounds like quite the emotional journey.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Motive Studio and publisher EA have released a new story trailer for its upcoming remake of Dead Space, and the game continues to look terrifying and beautiful. 
Due out on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC later this month on January 27, this might be one of our last looks at the remake before it's in the hands of players. Fortunately, this new trailer is nearly two minutes of cinematics and gameplay from the remake focused on the story of Dead Space. As expected, this remake isn't changing much at all, utilizing the same story from the original 2008 release with updated visuals and audio (plus some new voice lines for protagonist Isaac Clarke). 
Check out the new Dead Space Remake "Humanity Ends Here" trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, Dead Space Remake continues to look great and we can't wait to play it in just a few weeks.

        <updated>2023-01-11T13:42:07.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Final Fantasy XVI is due out June 22 exclusively on PlayStation 5, but some fans believe a PC version of the game could release as soon as six months after its console debut. However, FF16 producer Naoki Yoshida isn't sure why. 
During a recent Final Fantasy XIV stream, Yoshida, who is a director on that game, was asked about rumors surrounding a PC version of FF16, and he responded, "I don't know where the notion of a PC version releasing six months after the game is out came from as none of us have ever said that," according to a translator, as reported by Eurogamer. He followed it up with two instances urging fans to buy the PS5 version. 
According to a translation by Siliconera, Yoshida also said, "There's been talk that the PC version will come out, but no one on the team has said anything about the PC version. I wonder why people assume the PC version will arrive six months after [the PS5 version], so just go ahead and buy a PS5." 
The talk of a PC version of the game stems from a promotional PlayStation 5 video released last year that says in small print that FF16 will be a "PS5 exclusive for six months." Some extrapolated from this small print that a PC release of the game will come after that six months of exclusivity is up, but if Yoshida's recent comments are any indication, the team has nothing to say in regards to a PC version. 
Final Fantasy XVI hits PlayStation 5 on June 22. While waiting for more information, watch this "Ambition" trailer that reveals more about Valisthea's kingdoms, dominants, and eikons, and then check out our interview with Yoshida about the game's boss fights.

First revealed back in 2014, Dead Island 2 was in development at Spec Ops: The Line developer Yager, with Dead Island developer Techland having parted ways with the property to work on Dying Light. Publisher Deep Silver handed over development of the game to LittleBigPlanet 3 developer Sumo Digital in 2016, and then, in 2019, the company announced that Homefront: The Revolution developer Dambuster Studios would be developing Dead Island 2. It's now 2023 and Dambuster's Dead Island 2 is due out in April, finally.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[These days, box offices are dominated by comic-book and superhero movies from Marvel and DC. Unfortunately, while superhero movies have improved dramatically over the last decade, superheroes haven’t been as powerful in the realm of video games. In fact, nearly 40 years after the first superhero video game, many developers still struggle to create worthwhile experiences using some of the biggest names in entertainment today.
While not all superhero games are monumental duds like Superman on Nintendo 64, many tend to deliver middling, forgettable experiences. However, a select few that defy the stereotype to become superb titles we still look back on fondly as not only great superhero games, but terrific video games in their own rights.
While the superhero films of today are often criticall…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Weapon durability and its application in games have long been hot topics amongst players. Some love it, some are fine with it, and others hate it. And those feelings vary depending on who you are talking to about this topic. I think of games like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild when someone brings up weapon durability, as it was a hotly debated aspect of its release (I didn't mind it at all, personally). 
Love it or hate it, weapon durability is a feature that will likely never go away in games, and that's okay because when it's done right, it can be a helpful way to push players toward something new. In 2011's Dead Island, weapon durability was a big part of the experience, and that feature will return in Dead Island 2 when it hits PlayStation and Xbox consoles, and PC, on April 2…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Don't expect The Last of Us HBO show to extend beyond the story of the two games in the series. That's because The Last of Us game director Neil Druckmann says there are no plans for stories beyond the games in this show.
This news comes by way of a new interview with Druckmann from The Hollywood Reporter, as reported by GameSpot. Here's what Druckmann told THR specifically: "We have no plans to tell any stories beyond adapting the games. We won't run into the same issue as Game of Thrones since The Last of Us Part: II doesn't end on a cliffhanger." 


Druckmann and TV series writer Craig Mazin have mentioned that a second season of this show might cover the events of The Last of Us Part II (personally, I think The Last of Us Part II could cover two seasons of television). Despite the duo not wanting the show to go beyond the games, there might be a way for the show to cover more ground after the events of The Last of Us Part II. If Naughty Dog were to develop a theoretical The Last of Us Part III, it wouldn't be surprising if the HBO show covered that down the road. Chances seem pretty good considering Druckmann told THR that there is "more story to tell" in the world of The Last of Us games. 
Mazin also touched on his desire not to extend the show beyond the games in the THR interview, as noted by GameSpot, stating that he doesn't "have any interest in a spinning-plates-go-on-forever show." 
"When it becomes a perpetual motion machine, it just can't help but get kind of...stupid," he continued. "Endings mean everything to me." 
For more about The Last of Us on HBO, read our interview with Joel actor Pedro Pascal and Druckmann about the changes made for this TV show. Check out this new piece of concept art from The Last of Us multiplayer game that Naughty Dog is currently developing after that.

But perhaps more than any property that has moved from interactive medium to passive television, The Last of Us seems most suited to make the transition. Joel and Ellie’s story is an emotional and cinematic one that does not rely on player choice.
Ahead of the show’s premiere we spoke with some of the actors about the adaptation, as well as Neil Druckmann, co-creator of The Last of Us, who was heavily involved in writing the show and directed a few episodes.
Druckmann is no stranger to directing actors, even if the recording process of a TV show is different from how it works in a video game. “There is a certain luxury we have in video games that when we capture a performance, we have eve…]]></summary>

Players control Kai, a lone warrior battling an evil robotic army in a post-apocalyptic world. This side-scrolling action title boasts plenty of satisfying action thanks to Kai’s fun melee combat, nimble platforming abilities, and his signature grappling hook, which he uses to traverse levels as well as yank and toss enemies. Sporting great 16-bit art and a strong soundtrack, Gravity Circuit is worth keeping an eye on for fans of classic throwbacks. 
Join editors Wesley LeBlanc and Marcus Stewart as they explore Gravity Circuit’s free Steam demo and discuss why it may be one of the year’s most exciting indie gems.

Many JRPGs have slow openings, taking their time to establish the story and familiarize the player with the mechanics before letting them loose into the world. I figured that was the case after playing an hour of Dragon Quest Treasures, so I said to myself, “It’ll get good soon!” I said it again two hours in, three hours in, and five hours in, until eventually, I was forced to accept that this was as good as the game would get. Dragon Quest Treasures is never short on charm or style, but simple, sub-par combat and loot-hunting mechanics had me scraping the bo…]]></summary>
