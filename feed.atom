        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We’ve all been there. You’re playing a game you really like; the action is tight, the visuals are impressive, and the systems are engaging. Then a character opens their mouth, and the dialogue and how it’s delivered is so cringeworthy that you’re ready to jump ship. Sometimes that’s bad writing. But when we’re talking about a game from a different part of the world, it’s just as likely that questionable localization is the culprit. 
Localization and translation is difficult. Doing it exceptionally well is exceedingly difficult. Often, minute cultural differences in how storytelling is delivered in different places can add up; in the aggregate, those minor differences can alienate players from another region. Another contributing complexity is the way that language, facial expressions, and …]]></summary>

The Gamecube started off with a bang in 2001. As if Star War: Rogue Squadron 2: Rogue Leader, Luigi’s Mansion, and Wave Race: Blue Storm weren’t enough to get fans through the year, Pikmin and Super Smash Bros. Melee dropped on the same day on December 3, 2001. It would be crazy to pit any game against such a titan today, but Smash Bros. wasn’t yet the institution it would soon become.
I have a lot of warm memories of Pikmin. I remember failing to get the last piece of the Dolphin on my first attempt and arguing about the existence of purple Pikmin on message boards. Good times.
In preparation for Pikmin 4 (which is one of my most anticipated games of the year), Nintendo has released the first two games on Switch in a nice, clear HD update. There's precedent. They previo…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bethesda's Indiana Jones game, which is currently being developed by Wolfenstein developer Machine Games, will be exclusive to Xbox. 
This news comes from an ongoing court trial between the Federal Trade Commission and Xbox (and Activision Blizzard, which Microsoft is trying to acquire) happening today, which is where Bethesda's Head of Publishing Pete Hines revealed the game will be a console exclusive on Xbox, as reported by IGN. Like Xbox's other first-party releases, Machine Games' Indiana Jones game will also come to PC. 
However, Hines also revealed that Disney and Bethesda parent company ZeniMax originally signed an agreement that this Indiana Jones game would be multiplatform, meaning it'd likely also release on PlayStation. Hines says after Microsoft acquired ZeniMax in 2020, the agreement with Disney was amended to transition the Indiana Jones game away from a multiplatform release and instead, into one that will release exclusively on Xbox and PC.


Today's court trial also revealed that Xbox head Phil Spencer told Hines that Bethesda should look at title exclusivity on a case-by-case basis, IGN reports. As for why Indiana Jones was transitioned into an exclusive, Hines cited "reducing risk and trying to get a degree of clarity." 
"You're dealing with a licensor who is giving a ton of feedback on what you're making, is going to add a ton of time to your scheduling, these agreements, you don't get to take as long as you want, you have a window of time in which you're going to release a game, you immediately have a clock that's ticking on you," Hines said, according to IGN.
Bethesda revealed Machine Games' Indiana Jones game back in 2021 with a short teaser trailer, and that was the last we've seen of it. However, Bethesda head Todd Howard says he first pitched this Indiana Jones game way back in 2009. There's still no release window for the game today.

Fortunately, the final product is as fantastic as I hoped it would be.
Final Fantasy XVI marks a bold new direction for the franchise. If you’re a fan of the previous turn-based entries, this game may feel downright alien at the start. Thankfully, Final Fantasy XVI takes many steps to help ease players into its mechanics. With time, you too can Precision Dodge into deadly counterattacks that trigger long, impressive combos.

Now with the shorter title, Super Mario RPG, Nintendo and Square Enix's (formerly Squaresoft or Square) collaboration will be available to a wider audience on 17th November 2023. It's not just getting a digital release, either. It feels like a different era — a Mario RPG is a tentpole release in Nintendo's schedule.

Square Enix has announced that it will hold a special anniversary live stream next month to celebrate five years of the narrative adventure franchise Octopath Traveler. The stream will take place on July 13, the same date as the first title graced its presence on Nintendo Switch.
Developed by Square Enix and Acquire, the Octopath Traveler titles allow players to follow the interconnecting tales of a party of distinct protagonists, who cross paths under their own respective circumstances. Octopath Traveler and its recent sequel, Octopath Traveler II, have garnered devoted fanbases due to their traditional RPG nature, interesting characters, and artistically impressive worlds. The second title has sold over one million copies since its February launch on PC and consoles.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exUzGmKmr60
Produced in alignment with Weekly Famitsu, the live stream will feature guests such as Square Enix producer Masashi Takahashi, Acquire lead Keisuke Miyauchi, and series composer Yasunori Nishiki. The stream will include interviews, a retrospective, and the results of a recently held Japanese fan survey. As to whether we can expect any reveals... Well, a sequel literally arrived less than six months ago, so any new titles or spin-offs seem unlikely. But perhaps Square Enix will have something interesting to show fans.
The Octopath Traveler Anniversary Stream will take place July 13 at 20:00 JST, which is a red-eyed 04:00 in PT times. If there is any news, we will be sure to keep you abreast of it.
Octopath Traveler II is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Nintendo Switch.

In case you missed it, Pikmin 1 and 2 HD have been re-released on Switch. It was all done in the form of a surprise announcement in a June 2023 Nintendo Direct, as Nintendo tends to do! This is a great day for preservation, as you can pick up Pikmin 1-4 on Switch by the time the latest iteration arrives on July 21. The 3DS sequel/spinoff Hey! Pikmin remains on the outside, but who knows: Nintendo will probably get around to porting it one day.
Oh, and Story of Seasons: A Wonderful Life is out too, which our own CJ Andriessen enjoyed quite a bit. Between these two titles and a Super Meat Boy puzzle spinoff (Dr. Fetus' Mean Meat Machine), it's an interesting week for the Nintendo eShop. Variety is the spice of life.

When you initially think of Call of Duty, the idea of fighting a nonstop horde of the undead probably isn't the first thing you'd think of. Well, at least until after the Zombies mode became a staple of the Call of Duty series, becoming as much a part of the franchise as its multiplayer and campaign modes.
Since its original inception in Call of Duty: World at War, many players have grown attached to Zombies, as it provides a fun four-player co-op excursion from the series' standard modes. However, with so many titles now including the mode, the amount of available maps has skyrocketed.
Here are 10 of them that remain the best the series has offered to date.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As well as a Hummer for all you fabulous gas-guzzlers*
It looks like two vehicles driven by the most famous doll in the world are preparing to hit the garages of dazzling arcade racer Forza Horizon 5 — The Corvette and Hummer driven by Margot Robbie in upcoming movie, Barbie, will be arriving in-game at some point in the near future.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_RsVstmcls
The two vehicles were noted by Forza fan IdleSloth, who spotted placeholders in the game's Promo menu. The two cars featured are the "1956 Barbie Movie Corvette EV", (featured in the Chevrolet section), and the "2022 Barbie Movie Hummer EV Pickup", (featured under GMC). Videos of the vehicles in Showcase Mode were later uploaded by another Forza devotee, Aziial.
No dates for the drop have been announced, so it is assumed the two *electric vehicles will arrive as free downloads or in-game rewards to cross-promote the movie itself, which premieres July 21.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wN7qCE4uI_s
Directed by Greta Gerwig, Barbie follows the adventures of the titular doll, as she and her long-time pal Ken (Ryan Gosling) leave Barbieland to visit the "real world" and get a taste of reality. A huge ensemble cast includes Simu Liu, Kate McKinnon, Will Ferrell, Michael Cera, America Ferrara, Issa Rae, and Helen Mirren. Response to recent trailers has been extremely positive, and all that's left is the waiting game before we find out with the talent both in front of and behind the lens can live up to the hype.
Forza Horizon 5 is available now on PC and Xbox platforms. Barbie premieres in U.S. theaters July 21.

Ah, Cyberpunk 2077. What a road you've been down. From one of the most disastrous launches in recent gaming history to an enjoyable dystopian RPG from the people that brought us The Witcher. CD Projekt Red has been doing what it can to make its open-world title the product it should have been at the start, and the latest update has been rolling out.
Patch 1.63 for Cyberpunk 2077 comes with a host of tweaks and fixes, as all good patches should. In this instance, particular attention has been paid to some of the game's quests. For example, there's been a fix for the "All Along the Watchtower" and "I Walk the Line" missions, in which V could randomly flat line.

There's also been some fixes for some of the side quests (known as "gigs"), including "Guinea Pigs," "Bloodsport," "On a Tight Leash," and more. The patch also puts a band-aid on some issues with the UI and makes improvements for DLSS Frame Generation, specifically for those running the game on AMD processors. The patch notes on Steam give a better idea of just how much has been fixed for version 1.63.
It's clear that Cyberpunk still has a few problems, but then what release doesn't these days? Hell, Skyrim is still one of the most popular RPGs of the last decade, and that title's so loaded with bugs that it's pretty much become a meme at this point.
Alongside these changes, many of you are anticipating Cyberpunk 2077's Phantom Liberty DLC, which is set to release on September 26. There's also a follow-up that CD Projekt Red announced in 2022, but that's far off into the future. Hopefully, CDPR has learned a lot from Cyberpunk 2077's notorious launch before diving into sequel development.

The latest Japanese charts are in from Famitsu (via Gematsu) and surprising absolutely nobody, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom once again lands in first place with another 31,151 copies sold. This marks the sixth consecutive week that Link's latest has held onto the top spot, and it leads by some margin this time.
Mario Kart 8 Deluxe has managed to pull into second place, with 7,489 sales this week, while last week's runner-up Diablo IV has dropped down to fifth, selling 4,902 copies. This has been enough to push Breath of the Wild out of the running after it previously appeared in the top ten, benefitting from some spill-over in interest from TOTK.

Cygames revealed Umamusume Pretty Derby: Nekketsu Hachamecha Dai Kasha-sai as part of Japan’s Nintendo Direct yesterday, but there was little indication of its release plans. The publisher has now confirmed that the game will be coming to North America as Umamusume: Pretty Derby – Party Dash.
The pixel art visuals are cute, but what grabbed my attention is the obvious nods to the Nekketsu/Kunio-Kun series. There are four events in this party Grand Prix: Hurtling Hurdles, Blazing Baskets, Dodgeball Demolition, and Gourmet Gauntlet. Alliterations are fun. Three of those events bear a resemblance to games in the Kunio-Kun series. In particular, the Blazing Baskets game has three nets stacked on top of each other, which was part of Nekketsu Street Basket.
https://youtu.be/M8SzQG-VLjU
Homage aside, it’s definitely not just a straight copy. There are a lot of new things mixed in with these games, like turning someone into a penguin for some reason. Collectibles of some sort are on the playing field. It looks like all events are a free-for-all. There actually isn’t a whole lot to go on in this press release, but I think the trailer speaks for itself.
We’re promised a “star-studded cast of Umamusume to play as.” I don’t know what that means beyond them being horse girls. I’m going to be honest with you, I know nothing about Umamusume. This is actually the first time I’ve heard of it. I do watch anime from time to time, but it’s part of a very sparse likelihood that I’ll watch a TV show at all. This trailer doesn’t really get me interested in the show, but the game looks fun.
Umamusume: Pretty Derby – Party Dash is coming to PS4, Switch, and PC sometime in 2024.

Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor is in the works at Funday Games, not original DRG devs and fellow Danish outfit Ghost Ship Games. But it does fall under the latter’s new publishing arm, Ghost Ship Publishing, and can trace its origins back to a casual meeting between Funday co-founder Anders Leicht Rohde and Ghost Ship CEO Søren Lundgaard – and beyond.

In the run-up to Starfield, many of you will be anticipating the antics you can get up to in Bethesda's space-faring RPG. While it's unlikely that the game will let you "hang ten" (or whatever) while exploring alien worlds, you can still pull some moves with a skateboard themed on the game.
Over on the Bethesda website, if you wish to relive those glory days of the Tony Hawk games you can pick up an "aerial skate deck" while you wait for Starfield to come out. Featuring the logo and artwork inspired by the upcoming game, the item itself does not actually come with wheels. But don't worry. The site says you can still hang it on your wall.
[caption id="attachment_388074" align="aligncenter" width="450"] Image via Bethesda.[/caption]
This is just one of many Starfield paraphernalia objects that you can buy (so long as it's in stock), such as a journal, "constellation" jacket, desk mat, and, of course, a mug. If you do want to pick up the skateboard deck, currently priced at $75, you will need to purchase the wheels and grip tape separately, unless you have some spare lying around.
Much of the gaming world is eagerly awaiting the arrival of Starfield. Originally set to release in November 2022, the date was pushed back to sometime in 2023 before a final launch date of September 6 was officially announced by Bethesda.
It represents something a little different for the Elder Scrolls and Fallout studio, so a lot of people are curious to see what Todd Howard and his team have been working on these past few years. Then, and only then, will the studio give news about the whereabouts of TES6. Maybe!

Nintendo confirmed rumours during the June 2023 Nintendo Direct that a brand new 2D Super Mario game will be making its way to Switch, and the world felt a little bit brighter, if only for a moment.
Yes, Super Mario Bros. Wonder will be launching on October 20th, 2023, and many folks immediately noticed that not only is this the first brand-spanking-new 2D Mario platformer in over a decade, but it's also the first 2D Mario platformer (discounting Super Mario Run and the Mario Makers) to not feature the word 'New' in its title since 2006.

At best, studios reimagine classic experiences in exciting new ways, sand away rough edges, and somehow retain the intangible x-factors that made fans fall in love with these titles in the first place. At the very least, remakes offer a great way to play antiquated or less accessible experiences on modern hardware. 
The remake boom has been in full swing in recent years to the point that it’s starting to get tough to keep track of all the projects in the works. Thankfully, we’ve gathered as many of the announced remakes (not remasters) that we could find and gathered them in one neat list, arranged chronologically by release window.

From now on, EA Games will be known as EA Entertainment, which really doesn't have as good a ring to it (no one's going to be quoting "it's in the entertainment," any time soon are they?). The name change does imply a broader expansion into more than just games, but it's obviously a bit of a wait and see kind of situation until EA show off something that isn't a video game.

[Update: While invites to the lucky parties invited to this week's "Stress Test" should have been received yesterday, NetherRealm Studios has konfirmed that the invites are delayed, and are to arrive later than expected.]
Life in the world of Mortal Kombat 1 sure moves fast — It was only a few weeks back that NetherRealm Studios revealed the latest release in the gory fighting franchise, and already we're entering the playable beta stages, with the game launching on PC and console platforms just three months from now.
And if the recent gameplay footage from Summer Game Fest whet your bloodthirsty appetite, you monster, then you could get the opportunity to play Mortal Kombat 1 for yourself next week, with the koming of a new "Online Stress Test", designed to put pressure on the new sequel-prequel's servers ahead of the launch period. The testing period will run from June 23-26 and will offer up one-on-one online action and limited Klassic Tower battles, obviously with something of an abridged roster.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mV175rgyH0k
If you want to throw your name in Kung Lao's razor hat, then head on over to the official website and register today. Interested parties will need a Warner Bros. gaming account, (you can register at the time if necessary), and the Mortal Kombat 1 Stress Test is only open to PS5 and Xbox Series X users in North America, Latin America, Europe, and Brazil. Lucky Kombatants will then receive access kodes to download the beta client at some point next week, ahead of the head-ripping khaos.
Mortal Kombat 1 launches September 14 on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms. Our own Eric van Allen has already played a build of the exciting-looking scrapper, and you can read his thoughts right here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Said to be 'horrified' by recent events
The news about the missing submersible, Titan, which disappeared during a visit to the wreck of the Titanic is on many people's minds and all over the media. Now, the story has reached the gaming world, as the indie horror title Iron Lung has seen its sales increase in the wake of the real-world incident.
According to developer David Szymanski over on Twitter (via PC Gamer) there's been a spike in the amount of units that have sold for the creepy, underwater game. Szymanski shows a graph that depicts a significant uptick in sales, right around the time the missing sub became huge news in global media. This would suggest that the story of the missing occupants onboard the submersible has inspired some to buy Iron Lung.
https://twitter.com/DUSKdev/status/1671498543771574273
For those who don't know, Iron Lung is a small horror game that tasks you with investigating mysterious goings-on underwater. You're placed inside a cramped, iron vessel that takes you to the depths of an alien ocean, with nothing but ominous sounds and grainy pictures to keep you company. It was actually one of our Top 10 pics of 2022.
However, the fact that people are now buying the game in the wake of the missing Titan could be seen as poor taste by some. In fact, the developer has said, in response to someone on Twitter, that they "feel kinda uncomfortable" about the rise in Iron Lung's popularity. One person made a comment about not being sure whether they'd be "honored or horrified" by what's been happening, though Szymanski says they are "pretty horrified."
At the time of writing, the Titan sub, which went missing on June 18, has still not been located. Additional search and rescue teams are still looking for the vessel as well as its five occupants.

It's an adaptation on one of Toriyama's lesser-known mangas, which features a band of misfits who aim to right the wrongs of a king who's hogged the desert's vital water supply. I got to play it for all of 20 minutes, in a demo that was as stripped back as a grated cactus. Still, I got to sample a bit of roaming about in a tank, one brief stop at a town, an opening of one (1) chest, and some fighting. It seemed okay, I guess? But my main worry is whether its desert is interesting enough to hold people's attention.

The announcement of a Switch remake of the beloved SNES game Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars set many a nostalgic heart racing during the June 2023 Nintendo Direct, and sharp-eyed gamers have noted that the upcoming return of Square's 16-bit classic will bring some previously blurry elements into much sharper focus. In fact, it's now possible to spot cameo appearances from other Nintendo characters that were difficult to discern back in 1996.
On current evidence (check out the trailer at the bottom of the page if you'd like a reminder), the modernised art style is being used to sensitively adapt the original isometric visuals for modern hi-res displays, and @BridgeOfFaust on Twitter noticed a cameo from none other than Diskun in the new trailer. Playdate's Cabel Sasser noted a potential nod to Stunt Race FX beside the Japan-only Famicom Disk System mascot, too:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Well, pluck me running
The Wild Gentlemen and Joystick Ventures have announced that the Chicken Police are returning in Chicken Police: Into the Hive. It’s currently set for release sometime in 2024.
I didn’t play Chicken Police: Paint it RED when it was released in 2020, but did pick it up the following year. It was fantastic. I may have missed its review window, but I still ended up praising it high-and-low in a later article. While the first game stuck to its noir trappings, it was a strangely optimistic story that left me with good feels, even while its narrative was decidedly dark. While it has a strange veneer, it also presents an intriguing world that I’m excited to see further explored.
https://youtu.be/Alt5JsimUbY
While Chicken Police: Into the Hive’s trailer is somewhat lacking in specifics, the Hive was explained in the previous game. It’s essentially an area where the city of Clawville sends its unwanted, which is a slightly more generous way of saying that it's a slum for insects. Manny expresses regret that the population was treated so unfairly, but the area isn’t really explored beyond that in the first game.
This makes the Hive a fertile ground for storytelling in Chicken Police: Into the Hive. Again, the trailer only gives hints of what it’s going to cover, but it depicts a cold-blooded murder and unrest in the streets.

Moreover, it shows a return of the unique mix of photo-manipulation and anthropomorphic animal characters that helped the first game stand out. I’m so jazzed for this. I can barely contain all my jazz.
Unfortunately, I’ll need to keep a lid on my jazz until 2024, which is when Chicken Police: Into the Hive is expected to launch on PC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I hope you have space, Snake
The Metal Gear Solid Master Collection (Volume 1) is coming to Switch and a bunch of other platforms. That's good! But on Nintendo's system, it's going to require an off-the-cart download. That's bad!
So let's go directly into the bad news. Thanks to some extra info on the Konami website (it's at the very bottom if you have the Switch version selected), we have an idea of how this is all going to play out. The site breaks down how much of the game is actually on the physical cart, and it doesn't look good. 2.4GB seems to be "front-loaded" on the cart, with the rest in your hands and your internet connection.
It gets worse when you look at the bonus content, which will bring the total download size up to 30GB. It doesn't seem like there's any wiggle room here, as Konami notes "to enjoy all available content, game data must be downloaded (free)," and an "internet connection is required." The site even recommends a microSD card off the bat.
The bit of good news, which is actually kinda-sorta false hope, is that these download sizes are "tentative" and "will be finalized by September 2023." Sorry, it's not actually good news, but you deserve some hope.
All of the Metal Gear Solid Master Collection Switch download sizes: What's on the cart?
Physical Version : 24.1GB ( *Front loaded onto cartridge 2.4GB )
Metal Gear Solid- Master Collection Version : 4.8GB
excl. MG&MG2 : 3.4GB
incl. MG&MG2 : 4.8GB ( Metal Gear & Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake : 1.4GB )
Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty - Master Collection Version : 8.0GB
Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater - Master Collection Version : 12.2GB
Bonus Content : 1.0GB + 30 GB for bonus videos
Have this all sorted before the game is out on October 24, 2023!
[Thanks John!]

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Punishin' Puyo-like puzzlin'.
Super Meat Boy changed the game when it released in 2010, as one of the first ‘big’ indie hits of the decade and one of the creators of a subgenre of hard platformers. One would think that such a legendary release would spawn a broader franchise, yet it never got a proper sequel, and Meat Boy only recently received another starring role in Super Meat Boy Forever, an auto-runner that failed to come anywhere close to matching the legendary status of his first game. Now Headup Development is trying with Dr. Fetus’ Mean Meat Machine, a Puyo Puyo-style falling block puzzler that focused heavily on crushing difficulty. It has its charms, but this is ultimately another middling new release for Meat Boy.
Taking place after the events of Super Meat Boy Forever, Dr. Fetus’ Mean Meat Machine places you in the role of the youthful villain as he sets up a lab and attempts to make the perfect clone of Meat Boy. Unfortunately, the DNA sample that he has is flawed, resulting in thousands of imperfect clones which are of no use to him. He thus puts the clones through a literal meat grinder, slowly weeding out the weak and imperfect ones while the best clones evolve and gradually become closer to the real deal.

Everybody's favorite spoiler, The Game Rating and Administration Committee of Korea, is at it again, this time apparently lifting the lid on an incoming remaster of one of the most genre-defining shooters of all time, id Software's Quake II.
While Activision is yet to officially announce said remaster, we have been here once before, as game ratings board previously leaked the remaster of the original Quake, ahead of its official reveal at the annual gathering of all things id, QuakeCon. Given that QuakeCon 2023 is set to take place in a little over a month from now, it seems pretty snug that Quake II Remastered is scheduled to make its appearance.
Originally released in 1997, at the height of the second major FPS boom, Quake II is a violent, sci-fi shooter that sees top-tier marine Bitterman fend off an entire alien invasion with an arsenal of bombastic weaponry. With its smart, interconnected stages, multiple player characters, and commitment to chaotic destruction, Quake II was highly praised by critics and fans, becoming a mainstay on the early online multiplayer circuit and boosting the Activision coffers long before Call of Duty was even in consideration.
We will be sure to give you a heads-up when an official announcement is forthcoming. QuakeCon 2023 takes place at the Gaylord Texan Resort & Convention Center in Grapevine, Texas from August 10-13.

        <updated>2023-06-22T10:00:09.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Inflation strikes again
In a statement to The Verge, Microsoft confirmed a price increase on the Xbox Series X coming to most countries. Planned to roll out on August 1, the price increase will apply to most countries apart from the US, Japan, Chile, Brazil, and Colombia. This move practically mirrors Sony's PlayStation 5 price increase that occurred last year.
According to the statement, the Xbox Series X will move to £479.99 in the UK, €549.99 across most European Markets, CAD $649.99 in Canada, and AUD $799.99 in Australia. The Xbox Series S will remain at $299.99 and not see any sort of increase.
"We've held on our prices for consoles for many years and have adjusted the prices to reflect the competitive conditions in each market," said Kari Perez, head of communications for Xbox in their statement to The Verge.
Xbox Game Pass will see a price increase in most markets
Alongside the console price increase, the monthly cost of Xbox Game Pass for consoles will also be increasing. This price change will go into effect nearly a month earlier, on July 6. Under these changes, Xbox Game Pass Ultimate will increase $2 from $14.99 per month to $16.99. The cost for the base Xbox Game Pass will increase by $1 from $9.99 per month to $10.99. The price of the PC Game Pass will not increase.
Of course, those already subscribed won't see the price increase until their next subscription renewal on or after July 6.
Although a bummer, I'm not surprised by these increases. Sony increasing the cost of the PlayStation 5 in select markets made it a no-brainer that Microsoft would probably do the same. As for the Xbox Game Pass, I think we all saw this coming. Most entertainment subscriptions have seen an increase in the last year or so including Sony's own PlayStation Plus. Hopefully Nintendo Switch Online won't be following suit!

You can check out the full trailer for that when it debuts later today, but leaks regarding the expansion were shared on the Sims Community fan site after details and screenshots were mistakenly shared on Steam earlier this week.

A brand new WarioWare title — WarioWare: Move It! — was announced at yesterday's Nintendo Direct with an aptly-amusing trailer and some perfect wiggling by Yoshiaki Koizumi. The latest entry in the microgame series looks to be returning to the series' roots, and that's made even more clear by the game's title in Japan.

Since 1991, Super Mario and Charles Martinet have become almost synonymous with other... At least, until Chris Pratt came and confused everybody with his voiceover performance in The Super Mario Bros. Movie. Gosh darn it, Quill.
Regardless, Martinet has been voicing characters like Mario, Luigi, Wario, and Waluigi for decades at this point. But because folks on the internet love to argue about stuff, many are currently claiming that Martinet might not be returning in the newly announced Super Mario Bros. Wonder.

Nintendo Directs are always chock-full of information on games coming to different regions. And while the North American Nintendo Direct had a bunch of games to show off, today's Nintendo Direct for Japan also had some surprising, intriguing games on display.
I try to make a habit of watching the Japanese Nintendo Direct after the North American one airs. For one, it's an interesting way to see how Nintendo organizes these shows for different regions; some games move further up in the rundown, or feel like they get a little more time. And in other cases, some games only show up in certain regions' Directs. It's a handy way to spot games you might have otherwise missed, and has put me onto early stand-outs like Gnosia's Switch port.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft has done a great job making some truly inventive special edition Xbox Series controllers, and their latest effort is one that uses the 'NASA-punk' aesthetics of upcoming big budget Bethesda RPG Starfield. The controller looks phenomenal, but it does cost a fair bit - so I thought it was worth letting you know that the early adopter tax has been lifted, and the controller is now down to £65. 
That's still fairly expensive, but given that this controller seems destined to sell out - as it has done in the US - then I thought it was worth bringing up regardless.

I can’t really imagine a future where I can afford to buy a home for myself, let alone one where I could make a living buying up repair jobs and selling them at a higher price. Not that I think I’d want to. But regardless, House Flipper is probably as close as I’m going to get.
Released in 2018, House Flipper had a profound effect on the simulator genre. Not that I think it meant to. However, it hit upon a nice balance of ugly jank and tactile gameplay. It wasn’t the first of its kind, but a combination of its engaging execution of its core concept and ability to connect with audiences made it a success that others hurried to emulate. We still live in a market glutted with job simulators, and while some of them are good in their own right, it’s hard for any of them …]]></summary>

As many of you may already know, Final Fantasy XVI will feature exactly zero minigames. That's a fairly disappointing aspect of a game that's not even out yet, so we believe an eulogy is due, right now.
Much like the plots from the various games in the Final Fantasy series, most of the franchise's awesome minigames also do not carry over from game to game. It's time we take a look at the most memorable ones and perhaps hope Square Enix ports them all to Final Fantasy XIV.
10. Fort Condor (FFVII Remake)
Fans can complain all they want about the story changes that Remake brought to the original story, but it's hard to argue that they did a bad job with Fort Condor.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We have Castlevania at home.
If nothing else, you’ve got to give the Skautfold franchise credit for being unafraid to mix things up. After Skautfold: Shrouded in Sanity introduced the series as a retro-style survival horror, its sequels went on to span the Metroidvania, shooter, and RPG genres. Skautfold: Usurper, the latest release in the series to come to Switch, was the first Metroidvania and boasts key art that's very reminiscent of Aria of Sorrow. Unfortunately, the game isn’t very good. There are some redeeming elements here, but this isn't something that we can enthusiastically recommend.
The plot takes place in an alternate 19th-century London, picking up shortly after an alien structure called the Citadel crashed down into the city and began releasing a nefarious ‘Fog’ that drove people insane and turned them into Lovecraftian monsters. You play as Saragat, a dead knight brought back to life by a necromancer named Waltham, who has taken control of Saragat’s body to destroy the keeper of the Citadel and seize its power for himself. Yet, despite the cool premise, the story feels quite poorly written. Dialogue is overall stiff and oddly paced, and it’s difficult to follow the relationships between characters and the vague histories they each present.

Sonic the Hedgehog's official Twitter page has just announced that Sonic's YouTube and Twitch channels will host a new Sonic Central on June 23. The live showcase is akin to something like a Nintendo Direct, and will tease some of Sonic's "upcoming projects, partnerships, and events" that will take place this year.
https://twitter.com/sonic_hedgehog/status/1671548671962521600?s=20
While still don't know any details about a possible new main entry in the Sonic series, we know about some of the treats Sega has in store for fans. Nintendo has just announced that Sonic will return in Sonic Superstars this Fall.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0il5KpfzvCU
Superstars is an entirely new game made in the vein of the classic 2D Sonic games. It'll feature modern graphics and we don't just get to play as Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, and Amy. We'll get to play them all at the same time in local four-player co-op mode.
If you think Fall is too far away, then fret not. Sonic will also return in Sonic Origins Plus this very Friday.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoyoWlOJILc
Origins Plus is a collection that features four classic Sonic games in HD, as well as 12 Sonic games from the Game Gear. It also boasts some new features like new challenges, modes, a playable Amy, and even her super form.
https://twitter.com/sonic_hedgehog/status/1671213321880748032?s=20
But as with all things Sonic, the backlash is never too far away. Twitter users are already claiming that the game has been leaked, and fans aren't happy with the quality of the sound of the Game Gear remasters. Twitter user Kirisame states that he has analyzed the audio files and complains that the stereo changes actually make the game sound worse.
https://twitter.com/kirisamemofo/status/1670235195050536961?s=20
To learn more about it all and more, stay tuned to Sonic's Twitch or Youtube channels this Friday, June 23, at 8 am PST or 11 am EST.

Bad news for Halo lore fans, as developer 343 Industries has confirmed that it will no longer be producing narrative cutscenes for Halo Infinite — The cinematics, which generally drop with each and every new season, will no longer be a part of the updates from Season 4 onwards.
Speaking on Twitter, 343 community director Brian Jarrard explains the decision.
"As we've refined our top priorities and shifted resources internally this year, we had to make the decision to forego seasonal narrative cutscenes to make room for the team to continue focusing on highly requested features, content, and improvements for Halo Infinite," writes Jarrard. 
https://twitter.com/ske7ch/status/1670926893078691841?s=20
"These trade-offs are never easy to make, and we truly appreciate your support as the team works to make Halo Infinite the best experience possible. While the job is far from over, Season 4 marks another big step forward and we remain committed to this journey with the Halo community."
Of course, 343 Industries was one of the Microsoft subsidiaries that was hit by layoffs at the start of the year, which forces the dedicated Halo team to prioritize its manpower and talent on the core elements of the sci-fi shooter. The studio has recently spoken of its aim to improve many areas of Halo Infinite's gameplay, with incoming additions such as a new career ranking system and the return of Infection Mode, both of which launched this week as part of Season 4's content.
Halo Infinite is available now on Xbox and PC platforms.

Revealed as a part of today's Nintendo Direct showcase, Marvelous Europe gave us a first look at Silent Hope, an upcoming action RPG that will be making its way onto Switch from 3rd October.
The game takes place in a world which has been silenced by its king and will see you playing as a team of seven heroes who venture into a series of endless chasms known as The Abyss (ringing any bells?) in an attempt to restore order.

That makes it a cheaper alternative to their PCIe 4.0 drives with DRAM, but still more than fast enough for PC gaming. Therefore, it's worth knowing that the 1TB 980 is now available for less than £40 at Amazon, a £16 reduction from its usual price and less than half the cost it debuted at back in 2021.

In childish, whimsical fashion as a childish, whimsical child, I grab my pair of chopsticks and start hitting them together as if I'm a drummer. "Olivia, don't do that," my mum scolds me. "Your grandma always used to tell me off when I did that as a child." Sullenly, I put the chopsticks back down on the table.

Well, 10 year old me, you're in for a treat. If you wait a couple of decades, you'll learn of Nour: Play With Your Food, a game which allows you to bang together chopsticks. The game wants you to. Nour is a physics simulation of a variety of foods, where you can choose the ingredients for the dish and add various "effects" of a non-culinary nature.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Parental Advisory Explicit Content
Twitch is adopting a new range of labels and tags with which it hopes creators can better classify mature content on their respective channels — The new tags, which are live on the platform right now, are the latest step in the company's efforts to improve community safety on the popular streaming service.
Initially, the site had a catch-all "Mature Content" label, but the new tags hope to be a little more specific as to what audience members can expect when visiting one of the site's millions of channels.
The new labels are:
Mature-Rated Games
Sexual Themes
Drugs, Intoxication, or Excessive Tobacco Use
Violent and Graphic Depictions
Significant Profanity or Vulgarity
Gambling
While the Mature labels warn Twitch viewers of a channel's content, they are not a replacement nor a "Get Out of Jail Free Card" for anyone breaking the site's Community Guidelines, which remain unaltered at the time of writing. Streamers may receive warnings for failing to accurately label their content, with potential blocks for repeat offenders. That said, Twitch also notes that a streamer will not be auto-suspended for mislabelling their channel. You can check out the full details on the new labeling system on Twitch.
Twitch continues to implement and experiment with rules, guidelines, and features in order to combat explicit content on the website. Of course, given the mammoth nature of the streaming platform, moderation has been a momentous issue for the Twitch team, which has led to false positives, user confusion, and the controversial application, (and sometimes retraction) of security and marketing measures.

Booster Course Pass Wave 5 will feature an all-new course in the bathroom-themed Squeaky Clean Sprint, as well as three new characters. Petey Piranha, who made his debut in Mario Kart: Double Dash; Wiggler, who debuted in Mario Kart 7; and Kamek, who appears in Mario Kart Tour (and was a character in Mario Kart 64 before being replaced by Donkey Kong in the retail version) are all set to join the roster of playable racers in this wave of DLC. Seven more courses will join the pack as well, but we have no indication of which tracks those will be just yet. You can see the announcement trailer below.


Wave 5 of the Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Booster Course Pass arrives this summer. The Booster Course Pass is included as a part of the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription plan, or you can buy the DLC pack itself for $25.]]></summary>

Today was a new Nintendo Direct, with a whole host of news for Switch owners on what's coming for the rest of the year on Nintendo's handheld hybrid.
It was, honestly, a pretty up-and-down Direct. I don't think there was a lack of big reveals; we got a new 2D Mario, an absolutely gorgeous remake of a classic Mario RPG, and the first two Pikmin games are hitting the Switch later today.
Still, for those with high hopes—especially given that this Direct is happening within the Not-E3 window—or those who don't care too much about Mario, I could see this falling a bit flat for them. Me? I'm personally into a lot of the third-party reveals we saw, like XSEED's new action-RPG dungeon-crawler and more Persona 5 Tactica footage.
But enough preamble. Let's run down the hi…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Star Ocean: The Second Story is getting an HD-2D overhaul that slaps the letter R at the end of the title, a nod to the fact that it’s a remake.
The game first launched for PlayStation in 1998 (1999 in the U.S.) and stars protagonists Claude, a human federation officer, and Rena, a mystically powered girl, who players choose to control in separate campaigns. The game heavily emphasizes decision-making as your choices determine which of many playable allies you meet along the way join your party. 


This enhanced remake includes a modernized version of the game’s real-time combat; players can now stun enemies with chain attacks. Another cool addition is that party members not in combat can still lend a hand by executing assist-style follow-up attacks.
Star Ocean The Second Story R launches November 2 for PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom arrived on May 12, its launch was accompanied by an Amiibo of Link. But Link was far from the only star of Nintendo's most popular game of 2023. During today's Nintendo Direct, the company announced the two other stars, Zelda and Ganondorf, are also set to receive Amiibo figures.
While the Tears of the Kingdom Link Amiibo is somewhat disappointing in its functionality (mostly the same as its Breath of the Wild counterpart), it provides special fabric for Link's paraglider. It appears as though fans should expect similar functionality from the upcoming Zelda and Ganondorf Amiibo figures, as the press release promises "valuable in-game items, as well as special fabric for the paraglider." 
The Tears of the Kingdom Zelda and Ganondorf Amiibo figures arrive later this holiday season. For more on what each Amiibo in the Legend of Zelda series does within The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, check out our Amiibo guide here.

This brand-new adventure sports a revamped art style (and more expressive characters) and stars the familiar foursome of Mario, Luigi, Peach, and Toad in addition to Daisy and Yoshi.


The 2D worlds sport trippy features caused by a new power-up called the Wonder Flower. This transforms the world and gameplay in unexpected ways; pipes come to life, Mario can stretch his body to absurd lengths, and hordes of stampeding rhinos can appear, among other wacky effects. The biggest gasp came from a new power-up that transformed Mario into an elephant. Yes, you read that right. Mario's an elephant now, and it looks delightfully ridiculous.

More specifically, the Arkham Trilogy is due out this fall and promises to allow players to experience "the definitive versions of Rocksteady's Arkham Trilogy games." This trilogy also includes all post-launch content, including DLC expansions, suits, Batmobiles, and more. All three of these games have been available elsewhere for years but this trilogy marks the first time Switch players can play through all three games. 
Check out Batman: Arkham Trilogy in the reveal trailer below: 


Unfortunately, this trilogy does not include the (pretty great) Batman: Arkham Origins, which wasn't developed by Rocksteady; it was developed by Gotham Knights developer WB Games Montreal.

As part of today’s Nintendo Direct, Nintendo spoke to me directly as they announced WarioWare: Move It!. They know my weakness. They will be targeting it on November 3, 2023 on Switch.
As the name implies, you’re going to have to get off the couch. Personally, this is not something I would be excited for, but WarioWare certainly has a way of making me willing to embarrass myself.
https://youtu.be/z4kkqicAeG0
It honestly looks great. The trailer shows off the poses you’re supposed to take. True to the series, they’ve been very careful to make you look ridiculous. There’s a person doing a mad squat and another just wiggling. You can also see a whole bunch of cameos from Mario titles and Pikmin. There also appears to be some modernized versions of older Microgames.
There’s also going to be local co-op, and there will also be 4-player modes. For 4-players, there's a board game style party mode. I really hope they call the mode "Super Wario Party." I can't be the only one who thought of that.
I am definitely on board with this. I actually skipped the WarioWare: Get it Together due to a lack of funds, but I really need to get around to it. I need to "get it together," if you will.
I suppose I have time, as WarioWare: Move It! will be releasing on Nintendo Switch on November 3, 2023.

To cap off its Nintendo Direct presentation, the legendary publisher lifted the lid on Super Mario Bros. Wonder, a brand new 2D platform adventure starring the iconic plumber and his friends. The new title will launch on Nintendo Switch on October 20, 2023.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JStAYvbeSHc
The trailer featured what, at first, appeared to be some classic 2D Super Mario action, but soon gave way to an elastic and playable world, featuring growing pipes, talking flowers, lanky Goombas, a night-time mode, and various other strange phenomena. The trailer also showcased the "Wonder Flowers" — powerups that can change our hero in all manner of ways, from making him taller, to increasing his jump height, and even turning him into an elephant!
Other characters are playable, including Luigi, Princess Peach, Princess Daisy, and Toad, and while the gameplay seems authentic to the 2D Super Mario style, Super Mario Bros. Wonder looks to play with the world and its characters in ways never before experienced, all daubed in a vibrant, "cartoon" visual style. More information will be revealed by Nintendo in the lead-up to the game's launch on October 20.

Today's Nintendo Direct is full of surprises. In addition to some excellent RPG news, we've got some info about interesting original titles as well. A prime example of this is Penny's Big Breakaway, a new 3D platformer from the team behind Sonic Mania.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAgpRYM2M8
While the game itself doesn't have too many similarities to the typical Blue Blur video game, it does promise a speedrun-centric slant with its Time Attack mode. More importantly, we got lots of yo-yo based attacks, which the titular Penny can modify with various snack-based power-ups. We can already find mentions of unlockable bonus items and secret stages, so it looks like this one will lean heavy on replay value.
Fortunately, this title won't be a Nintendo Switch exclusive. Penny's Big Breakaway will launch on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch in Early 2024.

For a minute there, I held my breath!
During today's June 21 Nintendo Direct, Nintendo talked about how successful Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom has been globally, and I thought for a moment: "Are we getting a Tears of the Kingdom DLC tease?" Nope! Just more amiibo. I'm sure all of you are thrilled.
Nintendo confirmed both Zelda and Ganondorf amiibo figures, which were heavily rumored thanks to some recent datamining efforts. No footage was shown off in terms of what they actually bring to the table digitally, but we did get a good look at the figures themselves, and they are fantastic.
[gallery link="file" columns="2" size="large" ids="387849,387850"]
This dual reveal comes directly after the recent news of Zelda amiibo restocks
Nintendo seems committed to getting a ton of Zelda amiibo back into circulation, as they confirmed prior to the Nintendo Direct that there was going to be a wide restock of old figures. This led to all sorts of speculation that they'd reveal more Tears of the Kingdom amiibo, which turned out to be accurate.
We still have the Sages/new Champions too! Maybe we'll get a reveal down the line after the inevitable DLC announcement.

As part of the latest Nintendo Direct, more details were given on the upcoming Pikmin 4. On top of that, they’ve also revealed HD versions of Pikmin 1 and 2. While the HD versions are cool on their own, they’ve actually shown off a lot of previously unknown information, so let’s take a look.
The Pikmin 1 and 2 HD versions will be available today. They only showed off the title screens of each, so it’s hard to tell if they’re just HD upscales or if they got the Metroid Prime Remastered treatment. I guess we won’t have to wait long to see.
Nintendo also showed off a number of new details for Pikmin 4. Dandori Battles pit you against another spaceman to collect the most trash. You can also finally explore planet PNF-404 at night, which is a first. You’ll find the new Glow Pikmin at night.

Oh, man. There’s an area that’s inside a house. Wait, I thought that the series took place in a post-apocalypse. That kitchen looks like it’s still in use. So, are we just robbing people?
Pikmin 4 is launching on Switch on July 21st, 2023. You can try out a demo for it today. You can also purchase Pikmin 1 and/or 2 on Switch sometime today.

Whether you played the originals in 2001 and 2004 on GameCube, or you’ve always been curious to try out those early games in the franchise, Nintendo is providing a chance to explore the games once again. HD versions of both projects are headed into the Nintendo eShop today.
Both games were critically lauded in their day for the creative approach they took to puzzles and problem solving, as well as the charming presentation and setting.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo has announced WarioWare: Move It, a new game in the long-running microgame series. 
The company revealed this during today's Nintendo Direct, highlighting the unique ways players can use two Joy-Con (and body movement) to complete microgames. One example shows a player using Joy-Con to balance Mario sliding in Super Mario 64. There's also plenty of first-person Wario action as well, with one microgame showing Wario trying to break out of what appears to be a jail cell. 


As you'd expect, WarioWare: Move It features a very unique, albeit strange, art style. Plus, it features two-player local co-op and a special Party Mode that allows up to four players to play various microgames together. 
WarioWare: Move It hits Switch on November 3.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pikmin 4 is right around the corner, but that didn't stop Nintendo from flooding us with new information about the game during today's Nintendo Direct. From a new underground area, to night expeditions, to a new demo out next week, here's everything you need to know about Pikmin 4.


The main draw in the newest game in the Pikmin series is Oatchi, a dog-like companion that assists you and your Pikmin as you try to survive the cute and hostile alien world. In addition to helping out with lifting and pushing items, you and your Pikmin can ride him across land and water. You'll also be able to upgrade his abilities over time, increasing the amount of damage he does, the number of Pikmin he can carry, or the total weight of objects he can push.
You'll need those upgraded abilities to explore Pikmin 4's new underground areas, which appear to be more heavily centered around contraption-based puzzles. With more treasures and new enemies, it's a lot less open than the aboveground portions, but should provide an interesting challenge.
Finally, Pikmin 4 marks the first time in the series your explorer will be able to go on nighttime expeditions. Wild creatures are in a frenzy, making them much more dangerous, but you'll have the help of the new Glow Pikmin, a species only out at night. Instead of throwing them one by one, you can focus them into one glowing energy ball to release all at once, doing huge amounts of damage.
If you want to try it for yourself, a demo for Pikmin 4 will be available on the Nintendo eShop on June 28. The full game will be released one month from today, on July 21. For more on the game, check out the recent trailer that reveals you can customize your explorer, or download Pikmin 1 and 2 on your Switch right now.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Persona 5 Tactica was announced recently through the Xbox Games Showcase, but details on gameplay were limited. Today’s Nintendo Direct brought us a closer look at the game while highlighting the project's appearance on Switch consoles.
In the game, the group from Persona 5 is pulled into a new world, where they join forces with a new character named Erina, who is fighting as a revolutionary against the prevailing power in that place.
Gameplay allows for both up-close and ranged attacks over the course of its turn-based tactics encounters, but you can also use Personas to get your point across. Knocking enemies down opens up the “One More” action to double up damage. The game also encourages canny positioning choices, since surrounding your foes with three characters opens up the “Triple Threat” ability to deal big damage.
Drawing from the capability seen in Persona 5, you can also fuse Personas to create new ones.
Persona 5 Tactica is coming to PlayStation and Xbox consoles, as well as Switch, on November 17.]]></summary>

It's called Detective Pikachu Returns, and the chatty, gruff-voiced Pikachu and his human partner Tim Goodman have a new batch of mysteries to solve in Ryme City. While we don't have a great sense of the game's plot or features, we'd wager there's plenty of investigative gameplay and puzzle-solving.


The first Detective Pikachu launched in 2016 for 3DS and was adapted into a live-action film in 2019.  We'll have to watch out to learn more about this follow-up in the coming weeks.]]></summary>

Nintendo announced this during today's Nintendo Direct, stopping short of really any details beyond that. The company didn't reveal a name or any details about gameplay, but it did actually show gameplay and it looks exactly how you'd expect. We control Peach in a 3D world that looks reminiscent of something we'd see in a Super Mario RPG.
One interesting thing the Direct did reveal was that when Peach steps on a special pedestal, her outfit changes, going from her usual pink dress to a bright, light blue dress that seems to indicate she's powered up in some way. But the reveal ends there, with Nintendo promising more information at a later date. The last game to star Peach as the main character was 2005's Super Princess Peach for DS.]]></summary>

The original Super Mario RPG was released for the Super Nintendo in 1996.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last February, Game Freak revealed that Pokémon Scarlet and Violet had DLC in the works, but all we got to show for it was a few pieces of concept art and static images of new Pokémon. Today changed that, as the Nintendo Direct showed off in-game footage for the very first time. Check it out for yourself below.


Titled “The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero,” this DLC comes in two waves. The Teal Mask is slated for this fall, while The Indigo Disk will come this winter. The first expansion will be available to play as soon as the player begins the treasure hunt, which happens a few hours into the game. Meanwhile, The Indigo Disk will require you to complete the entirety of the main story plus the previous expansion.
The first of the two expansions, The Teal Mask, will bring trainers to the land of Kitakami, an area completely distinct from the Paldea region they were born in. The adventure takes place during some kind of festival, and players will be tasked with unraveling mysteries tied to the local folklore. Part two, The Indigo Disk, takes place at Blueberry Academy, a school similar to Naranja and Uva Academy. As an exchange student, you’ll get to take classes, interact with students, and participate in the school’s battle-focused curriculum.
While the trailers didn't provide any major new announcements, we got another look at Pokémon we already knew about, like Okidogi, Munkidori, and Fezandipiti in the Teal Mask and Terapagos in The Indigo Disk. There are also new looks at the DLC's exclusive characters Carmine and Kieran.
No specific dates were announced today, but The Teal Mask will still be released this Fall, while the Indigo Disk will be released sometime this winter.]]></summary>

Final Fantasy XVI is bombastic, indulgent, and extreme, breaking far beyond the limits of what I thought an action-oriented Final Fantasy could pull off. It represents a pivotal shift for the series, ditching any semblance of turn-based move selection, active-time battles, or anything else in its history in favor of a fast-paced, extravagant, combo-heavy combat system that continued to grow more robust throughout my 60-plus hour journey. 
There’s a linear action game in FFXVI, and it’s the highlight of the experience. But standard RPG tropes, mechanics, …]]></summary>

Growth is one of these, and I'm hooked on the demo that's playable as part of Steam Next Fest. Taking place on a hexagonal grid, the aim is to uncover the map using a range of wildlife, fertilising the land in the process. Each tile you reveal gives you points, and you'll have to navigate around mountains, water, and special landmarks.

Dôveru si nemožno jednoducho udeliť úradným uznesením. Azda by pomohlo úplné zverejnenie špecifikácie a zdrojového kódu. Tomu sa však ministerstvo vyhýba "z bezpečnostných dôvodov".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Roblox is launching new regulation in order to allow creators to make content specifically for users aged 17 and above. From what Manuel Bronstein, Roblox's Chief Product Officer, shared in an official blog post yesterday, it seems that it'll be on creators to label their experiences as mature, which "may contain more violence, blood, or crude humour" than usual experiences.
The introduction of age appropriate access is not for safety primarily, as Roblox say they want to "simulate and even go beyond what's possible in the real world". Bronstein also added that, "We want to replicate that dynamic on Roblox," referring to the idea of getting older and legally being allowed to enter places such as nightclubs.

We've highlighted a few UK RTX 3060 Ti deals before, but here's one for the US market courtesy of Best Buy - on a PNY unit with a simple dual-fan design, plenty of cooling potential and a price that makes a lot of sense: $275, down from a previous price of $320 and considerably less than the $399 Nvidia is asking for their 4060 Ti FE.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good news, everyone! AMD's fastest graphics card is now available for less money, in what deals scientists are calling a "sale" or "limited time promotion". According to the latest research, this phenomena can be observed on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, specifically the UK and the US, with discounts applied on both sides. This makes it a better time to buy this particular item than times when it is more expensive, generally speaking. 
The specifics are as follows: the Sapphire Pulse Radeon RX 7900 XTX has been discounted from $1000 to $900 in the US (tick the $100 code on the product page), while Sapphire's AMD reference design has dropped from £1099 to £949 in the UK (no ticking required).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Immortals of Aveum was revealed with a short teaser trailer at the 2022 Game Awards. The implication of the teaser was that it was a game in early development, which is why it was a surprise when the game was revealed to be releasing July 20, 2023. That release date has now slipped, but only be a few weeks. It is now launching a month and a couple of days later, on August 22.
You can find the full delay statement, signed by developer Ascendant Studios and the game's director, Bret Robbins, below.
As you know, this is our first game as a self-funded independent studio. We set out five years ago to ambitiously make an original Magic FPS in a new fantasy world. Along the way, we worked through a pandemic, built a new team, developed on Unreal Engine 5.1 and pushed the boundaries of what we thought was possible. Now, the finish line is in sight.
The recent feedback to the game proves to us what we already felt: that Immortals of Aveum is something special. In order to realize our full vision, we are going to take a few extra weeks, making our new launch date Tuesday, August 22nd. This will give us time to further polish the game, finish optimizing all platforms, and deliver a strong launch. We owe it to ourselves and to you to get this right.
For more on Immortals of Aveum's delay, you can find an official blog post here. For some of our positive hands-on impressions of the game, head here.]]></summary>

From Software reached a critical and commercial apex in 2022 when it released Elden Ring, its most popular game to date by a large margin. And now that it's become a household name in the gaming world, the studio is going back to its roots.

This guide is keeping separate from the best Steam Deck microSD card list, mainly because a good microSD card is less of an accessory and more of a core essential (especially if you’ve gone for the 64GB Steam Deck model). Still, this guide will cover an array of addons, from alternative cases to thumbstick covers and USB-C docking stations.

Initially revealed on stage during Sony's 2014 E3 press conference, Dead Island 2 had an infamously rocky road to release. What briefly began in the early 2010s at Techland, the developer behind the first Dead Island and similar open-world zombie game Dying Light, then moved to Yager Development, then Sumo Digital, and then finally, Deep Silver's Dambuster Studio, was for many years a giant question mark in the game industry. Its publisher, Deep Silver, spent many of those years saying little to nothing about the game other than vague confirmations that it was still in development. Until it resurfaced in late 2022, a seeming sign that Dead Island 2 would see the light of day – which i…]]></summary>

June 20, 2023
While Nintendo's presence was typically a given back when E3 was still around, its relative silence over the last month left many to doubt whether or not there would be a summer showcase at all. The company's Twitter account has also been the source of a scattered handful of announcements lately, posting everything from new Joy-Con colors to a sequel to 1-2 Switch to a new trailer for Pikmin 4. Still, Nintendo has plenty to announce, whether it's something we expect (like Metroid Prime 4) or something entirely new.
We'll find out for ourselves at the livestream tomorrow.

I had grumpily asked if he could pick me and a friend up from a local park one afternoon, and he remembers us bundling into the back of his car all smelly and sweaty and terrible as teenagers so often are. But as he pulled away, he caught a snippet of our conversation that was so unusual it's the reason this seemingly normal car ride has cemented itself as a core memory. We were talking about the price of eggs. And tomatoes. And the order in which we were planting crops to ensure the greatest yield.


My poor father interrupted us, turning in his seat to ask what the hell we were talking about. “It’s a game we’re both playing called Harvest Moon” I scoffed in his direction. “You wouldn’t understand”.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CPU microcode updates are commonly done in the name of security fixes and resolving functionality issues.. In recent years, CPU microcode updates have been a much more common -- and important -- occurrence. While all modern CPUs rely on microcode it's just a matter of whether the version used is baked into the hardware or an updated version loaded by the BIOS or OS at boot time, a "vocal minority" of users are unhappy with CPU microcode being included in Libreboot ROMs. Thus moving forward there will be alternative builds of Libreboot for different motherboards with the CPU microcode stripped out in the name of software freedom...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ahead of the game's release in August, Baldur's Gate 3 has received a prequel murder mystery game that lets you vote on how things unfold. Playable for free in your browser, it's titled Blood in Baldur's Gate, and is set 15 years before the events of Baldur's Gate 3. Developer Larian Studios revealed the project yesterday. In it, you play as a detective tasked with solving a murder, and by you, I quite literally mean all of you, as this one will take a bit of collaboration.

But seeing as how they last about an hour and cost approximately the same as it would for Wales to secede from the United Kingdom, I can only afford to pay an immersive experience what it deserves every so often (the rest of the time I'm honourbound by my fatherland to donate to causes supported by Michael Sheen). I'm therefore pleased that there seems to be an uptick in escape room video games. Plese do more of those, developers.

I got to chat with principal designer Sandro Sammarco last week, and he told me they've been hard at work making sure it's "filled with loads of cool new stuff that people really haven't seen before". He also said that their partnership with Games Workshop has allowed them to "really go to town in terms of the visuals, the lore, [and] the story that we're telling", and he hopes that the way they've characterised the campaign's principal faction, the Stormcast Eternals, will give players plenty to sink their teeth into when it launches in full.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the same way that Alien: Isolation is, for many, now the definitive Ridley Scott’s Alien game, I’ve got no problem getting all ‘game critic who wants to feel important by making wild declarative statements’ and saying that Aliens: Dark Descent is now, for me at least, the definitive James Cameron’s Aliens game. It’s the first to really capture the white-knuckle vibe of setting up perimeters, quipping out that last line of top-tier banter you’ve been saving, and seeing the shapes on the motion tracker creep closer and squeal louder. It really does do the license justice, so if that’s what you’re looking for, dig in. I just wish it trusted me to be able to count higher than one. Not that much higher, either. Just four.
Dark Descent is not a game for strategy game fans nearly as much as it’s one for Aliens fans. You order your entire squad around at the same time, pausing or slowing time to issue commands like grenades or suppressive fire, using a stock of command points that refill over time. It’s a game that’s (rightly) decided that a very particular type of strategy game is the best format to convey Aliens’ whole schtick, but then seems to have realised, hang on, we’re at risk of (alien) isolating and possibly even (alien)ating a lot of potential customers here. What if there was a way to do XCOM but without all the knobbly bits?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One mistake I often see novice PC builders making is overspending on the motherboard. It's true that higher-end models offer more features and can support better overclocking performance, but for the vast majority of people you're better off putting your budget towards the highest-tier graphics card and processor you can afford - as these actually determine in-game performance! - then slotting in the cheapest motherboard that gets decent reviews and supports your components. 
One excellent example of just such a motherboard is the Gigabyte B760M Gaming X DDR4, a simple option that supports 12th/13th-gen Intel processors all the way up to the 13900K. With an asking price of just £116 right now, you can pick up this plus a cheap 16GB DDR4 RAM kit for just £152, letting you spend the vast majority of your PC budget where it really matters.

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2023/06/19/hideo-kojima-wont-direct-the-death-stranding-movie-but-he-is-deeply-involved"/>
        <updated>2023-06-19T15:54:41.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last December, Deadline reported that a Death Stranding movie was in the works. Kojima Productions, the studio that made the original game, was set to be one of two main producers, but there was no word on who would write, direct, or star in the film, or if any members of the original creative team would occupy any of those roles. Yesterday, Death Stranding's game director Hideo Kojima took to Twitter to clarify his involvement.
Just to be clear, I am deeply involved in producing, supervising, plotting, look, design and content of the film adaptation of DS, just not in charge of directing.
June 18, 2023
Here, Kojima confirms that he will not be directing the movie, but fans worried that Kojima Productions' involvement wouldn't involve input from the man at its helm can rest easy. In addition to his role as producer, Kojima will be "deeply involved" with many other elements of the film, including its plot and overall aesthetics. While the movie takes place in the existing Death Stranding world, it will "introduce new elements and characters within the Death Stranding universe," according to Deadline. Whether that consists of a retelling of an existing plot or an entirely new one is unclear, but it will certainly have that distinct Kojima touch.
In addition to the film-focused branch of Kojima Productions, the film will be produced by Hammerstone Studios. Founded in 2018, the studio's best-known films include Barbarian (2022) and Bill and Ted Face the Music (2020). The studio's founder, Alex Lebovici, had the following to say to Deadline about the upcoming project:
Given the fact that the production teams have yet to announce any director, writer or actor that's attached to the project (I'm hoping it involves Nicolas Cage), it's still a few years out. If you're dying for more Kojima before then, you can re-watch the Death Stranding 2 reveal trailer or fantasize about the game Kojima wants to make in space.]]></summary>

Every sprite oozes a frantic combination of energy and personality, from the steel-eyed sprint of your starting gun-bird-thing to the bobbing scuttle of the cyclops clayfish boss. Guns have punch, stomps have oomph, reward boxes have merry jingles. It's a top-down roguelike shooter that does everything right, and seldom have I seen a game more deserving of its Overwhelmingly Positive rating on Steam. 
It left early access 11 days ago, which is 11 days you could have spent splatting crustaceans and wasps with skeleton trombones and deadly finger guns.

It's been nearly 11 years since Edmund Mcmillen, known for Super Meat Boy and Binding Of Isaac, first announced that the mysterious cat breed 'em up would be Team Meat's next game. The cats wound up waiting outside while they worked on other things, but we now have a much more concrete idea of what the game is.
The developers have actually been posting extensive development updates since January, but McMillen also just recorded an adhoc TikTok video where he points his phone at his screen. Turns out Mewgenics is a turn-based strategy roguelike with wizard cats who can cut their paws while opening windows. Could be worth the wait!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Super Replay returns, and we're checking out Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts! Join us today on Twitch at 2:00 p.m. Central as we kick of the adventure, which will continue each week until we roll credits. We'll also have every episode available the next day on our Game Informer Shows YouTube Channel (or you can watch the videos in the above playlist). 
Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts was released for the Xbox 360 on November 11, 2008. The third (and, so far, final) entry in Rare's beloved platforming series centers on vehicle creation, where players collect and slap together hundreds of parts to assemble their own wacky contraptions to explore. The bevy of possible combinations and emphasis on player choice and creativity was largely unprecedented at the time, paving the way for future games such as the upcoming The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. However, this direction would divide fans due to how much it strays from the traditional Banjo formula. So where will I land on it? Let's find out.
Join me, Marcus Stewart, alongside Kyle Hilliard as we explore one of the Xbox 360's biggest hidden gems to see whether it holds up or falls apart like a poorly constructed doohickey. 
Watch on Twitch!

For a certain sort of Elder Scrolls player, it’s the only way to travel through a fantasy open world - perma-crouched, bow stretched lazily across the lower third of the screen. And it’s an appeal that creator Nate Purkeypile understands perfectly, having spent the larger portion of his career working on Bethesda’s RPGs, from Fallout 3 and Skyrim all the way through to Fallout 76.
“It’s probably not the best idea for most people to do a solo open world,” he says. “But at the same time, this is like my sixth one. I’m pretty sure what goes into these.”

Based on a French novel by Boris Vian, this tells a strange and surprisingly dark story about a famously handsome young himbo who gets caught up in a sinister plot in 1950s Los Angeles and has to adventure, talk, fight, and - horrors - reason his way to the truth. It's an adventure game with quick-time event bits, and a 50s America setting, all of which could put me off it entirely, but I can't bring myself to say anything bad about it at all.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Curious players can get their hands on Embark Studios’ ARC Raiders for the first time via a closed alpha later this month. 
On June 29, the PvPvE extraction shooter will get its first test out in the wild, so to speak. You’ll have to sign up on Steam to participate in the alpha, and a new trailer provides some fresh (pre-alpha) gameplay clips. 


ARC Raiders made its big debut at The Game Awards in 2021 and was originally pitched as a co-op PvE experience about players working together to battle invading alien machines. It had been slated to launch last year before Embark delayed the game in order to focus on finishing up its other upcoming free-to-play team shooter, The Finals (which has a second playable beta running now until June 21). Last month, Embark broke the news that it changed ARC Raiders into a more PvP-focused extraction experience, as now teams of players combat each other to retrieve resources in addition to fighting the enemy machines. 
Embark Studios has not given a release window for ARC Raiders, but they plan to launch it on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.]]></summary>

Did 2020's summer of gaming ever end? It did not. It is a constant. Like the stars in the sky or the ocean blue. Geoff is here. He has a game to show you. It's probably a horror game set in space. Doesn't that look great? Now let's take a look at the first game by a new studio comprised of ex-Bioware devs.


Yep, that's right. Not-E3 2023 is over (I think?) and once again I've commanded team RPS to dig their microphones out of storage before forcing them to tell me about their favourite game from the cavalcade of directs, showcases and presentations that have replaced my once beloved E3 weekend.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You know me, folks: I love management sims, and I love people in physical distress. Wasn't I only delighted, then, to play a bit of Galacticare, an upcoming hospital management sim in the same sticky vein as the hospitals Theme or Two Point. The twist? These hopsitals are in space! Like those managment games, your task is to build a hospital that runs as smooth as some kind of alien baby's bottom (the alien probably has tentacles), where you want to treat people and prevent them from dying as much as possible, but largely because death is bad for your profit margin more than any altruistic impulse. I mean you can be altruistic if you want, I suppose, but if you run out of money it's harder to build more weird bone-fixing machines.
The tone - though Galacticare has strange diseases like being eaten from the inside out by a singularity, and wacky treatments including a sort of laser disco machine - is actually much closer to kind of satire-ish hijinks of spacestation management game Startopia than I had expected, thanks in part to the extremely dry AI helper offering input, and the many alien species who'll come to you for treatment.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rockstar Games co-founder Dan Houser has announced Absurd Ventures, his new studio. 
Houser was Rockstar's vice president when he announced in 2020 that he was leaving the company behind franchises like Red Dead Redemption and Grand Theft Auto. At the time of the announcement, Houser revealed that he had taken an extended break starting in the spring of 2019. His last day at Rockstar, which he co-founded with his brother Sam Houser in 1998, was March 11. 
Now, three years later, Houser has revealed Absurd Ventures. This studio is focused on "building narrative worlds, creating characters, and writing stories for a diverse variety of genres, without regard to medium, to be produced for live-action and animation; video games and other interactive content, books, graphic novels, and scripted podcasts."


It sounds quite ambitious and while Absurd Venture's official website features all kinds of visuals showcasing its style, there's nothing official in terms of projects announced at this time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The next game coming to Nintendo Switch Online is Fire Emblem. 
More specifically, Nintendo has announced that the Game Boy Advance version of Fire Emblem, otherwise known as Fire Emblem: The Blazing Blade, is coming to its subscription service for all Expansion Pack subscribers next week on June 23. This is the seventh game in the Fire Emblem series but the first in the franchise to be localized for audiences outside of Japan. It first hit the U.S. in 2003. 


A prequel to Fire Emblem: The Blinding Blade, this game takes place on the continent of Elibe and follows Lyn, Eliwood, and Hector. As you might expect, combat movement takes place on a grid of squares before transitioning to animated attacks. There are different character classes and weapons, and characters who die do so permanently. 
Fire Emblem joins Harvest Moon, Kirby Tilt 'n' Tumble, and two more games announced for Nintendo Switch Online last week. While waiting for Fire Emblem to hit the library on June 23, read Game Informer's review of Fire Emblem Engage. 
Are you going to check out Fire Emblem next week? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Memory can be a fickle thing. For thirty-something Mimi, everything before her thirteenth birthday is a blank. What happened before that point is never really interrogated during Dordogne's three-hour run time, but we do know her father is a stubborn old goat who cut ties with Mimi's really quite nice grandmother Nora after a summer she spent there as a shy, sheltered twelve-year-old. It's this summer that seems to be the cork in Mimi's memory bottle, and it's also the window in which Dordogne frames its sweet, coming of age tale. As Mimi in the present comes to terms with her grandmother's recent passing, the objects she finds in Nora's now-empty summer house trigger important flashbacks to that golden summer, and maybe also the answer to Mimi's apparent amnesia. Dordogne never demands very much of you during these sequences, but it does know how to luxuriate in life's little details, and find pleasure in a more leisurely lifestyle.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the year’s best (and most literal) surprises, Hi-Fi Rush, is getting a free update that keeps the beat going with the addition of new modes and content. 
The “Arcade Challenge! Update!” hits on July 5 and adds two new game modes accessible after players have completed the main game. You’ll access these features by using a new arcade cabinet that appears in the hideout. 


The first is BPM Rush, in which players fight waves of enemies as the beats per minute gradually rise with each level, eventually topping out at 200 BPM. The second new mode is Power Up! Tower Up!, a remixed version of Rhythm Tower that tasks players to take a completely underpowered Chai and gradually build him with randomized upgrades by climbing floors and tackling waves of foes. 
This update also introduces new photo mode features such as stickers, filters, and poses, new clothing unlocks for Chai and Korsica, fresh 808 looks and accessories, and special attacks that incorporate CNMN and Smidge. 
Hi-Fi Rush is available on Xbox Series X/S and PC. You can read our review of the game here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Immortals Of Aveum is EA and Ascendant Studio's upcoming first-person shooter where, instead of propelling metal at high speeds, you're slinging magic with your hands. We got another good look at said magic slinging at this year's Summer Game Fest, which has seemingly resulted in several reports of it being like a wizardy Call Of Duty. But having played a 30 minute demo of it this week, I reckon it's nothing like COD at all, really. Instead, it's more like Doom / your other retro shooter of choice, but one that carries itself with a frightening seriousness. Sometimes, that's fine. There have been plenty of these smaller sorts of blockbusters that have successfully struck the right balance of silly to serious, with the best ascending to a place of endearment. But so far, Immortals Of Aveum hasn't filled me with hope that it'll join the likes of Psi-Ops: The Mindgate Conspiracy, or like, The Darkness, as a twinkling beacon of silly fun.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m sure that describing Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor as a mix of Deep Rock Galactic and Vampire Survivors sounds like it’s betraying a terminal lack of imagination. But, come on, look at it. It’s a top-down autoshooter/bullet heaven where defeated beasties drop XP blobs that fuel an escalating series of weapon and stat upgrades, playing out in the whimsical sci-fi/fantasy/corporate nightmare universe inhabited by DRG’s dwarves. "It’s a mix of Deep Rock Galactic and Vampire Survivors" is the most apt and succinct description that currently or will ever exist for it. So there.
And yet, being derivative doesn’t always preclude the opportunity for bloody good fun. I’ve played just over three hours of a very early Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor build, and while it’s both missing some parts and could benefit from the odd tweak, it’s already capable of pumping out dopamine as efficiently as any established VampSurvs-alike.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are old games that are plain too hard to get into now, even I have to concede. Ancient ruins of a house to be admired and contemplated, but not fit to live in. The ceilings are too low, the stairs too narrow, the pipes an afterthought. Jagged Alliance 2 isn't that far gone, but it’s getting there. It gives lots of options for fine control but using them is largely gated behind esoteric, repetitive keyboard shortcuts, which get doubly cumbersome during its awkward transitional moments between real and turn-based movement. 
It's about leading a group of mercenaries to overthrow the tyrannical queen of a fictional island. A guerrilla warfare sim with great strategic freedom and probably the best turn-based tactical combat ever, all buoyed away from self-seriousness by a campy, irreverent tone and intentionally over the top characters.
What I'm saying is: it's still worth it.

The first of the two expansions, titled Haus, asks the question, "How does a billionaire prepare for the zompocalypse?" and answers that with "a techno-death cult with a healthy splash of debauchery and gore!". Sounds about right. This first expansion has quite a vague release window, expected to launch some time between October and December this year.

I'm exceedingly pumped for Prince Of Persia: The Lost Crown - and so is Prince Of Persia creator, Jordan Mechner.

And in speaking to Mechner earlier this week about how he feels about The Lost Crown now, he tells me that "what I've seen so far of their modern 2D Metroidvania take on [Prince Of Persia] has got me excited and very eager to play."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Much as I adored Theme Park, it's a bit of a weird game to have inspired so many descendants. The latest is Park Beyond, and for the most part it's exactly what you'd expect. Build rides to attract crowds, shops to fill their stupid mouths, doctors to treat the vomitous and cleaners when the doctors were too late. Punters pay to use any ride, they pay for entry, for toilets and cash machines, and for every item you price in every shop.
That's as close as it gets to micromanagement, unless you count finely tuning the position of every rock, shrub, and decorative roof panel. It's more Planet Coaster than the cynical money grubbing of Theme Park, so if you're here for rollercoasters that do stunt jumps over canyons, it's mostly good news.

Essentially, the big thing it lets you do is build your own unique voxel structures by, essentially, painting them in the air. Think of it as a sort of paired back, voxel-focused approach to a piece of 3D modelling software like Blender.

Both had faced up to 10 years behind bars but guilty pleas, cooperation and rehabilitation all played a part in reducing their sentences.

The speedy hog is forever occupying a booth and starring in some new-fangled thing, which oscillates between a 2D sidescroller laser-targeted at old-school fans, or 3D ones like Frontiers that try their utmost to push the series forwards.
So, I've gone and played another Sonic haven't I? This time I spent around 15-minutes with Sonic Superstars at this year's Summer Game Fest, a new 2.5D sidescroller that seems to successfully combine the feel of Sonic Mania with a modern art style and some new tricks. If you like old Sonic games, there's no doubt in my mind you'll love it. If you don't, there's no doubt in my mind you'll think it's agony.

Valve announced the desktop update back in April, where the new version has been in beta for some Steam users to try out. In Valve's post from yesterday announcing the update is available for all, it did note that the "most impactful changes in this update aren’t immediately visible," as a lot of the work put into the update was today with how it "[shares] code across the Steam Desktop Client, Big Picture mode, and Steam Deck." According to Valve, these changes should mean that future features should be more quickly implemented and iterated upon.

Remnant: From The Ashes entered the looter-shooter space in 2019, defining its core loop with procedurally-segmented levels and Dark Souls-inspired mechanics like a stamina-based dodge roll and limited-use health consumables. Remnant’s fresh take on the shooter genre attracted praise, including Game Informer’s review which states, “Strong systems and a satisfying gameplay loop give Remnant: From The Ashes a powerful foundation, even if the experience is mired by repetitive and uninteresting bosses and environments.“

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rogue Legacy 2 is one heck of a roguelike that only Xbox, Switch, and PC fans have enjoyed since it launched in 1.0 last year. Next week, PlayStation fans finally get their turn.
Developer Cellar Door Games has announced that Rogue Legacy 2 will make the jump to PS5 and PS4 on June 20. Like the first game, you’ll take a randomly generated knight boasting a mix of strengths and sometimes hilariously crippling weaknesses through a sprawling castle to kill monsters, collect treasure, and uncover new areas. Between runs, you’ll spend hard-earned loot upgrading your town HQ, and unlocking new stores while improving the traits of your lineage of warriors to raise your odds of surviving subsequent runs. 


We awarded Rogue Legacy 2 a 9 out of 10 in our review, with former editor John Carson writing, "Despite my nitpicks, every new discovery unveiled, skills obtained, and boss defeated wipes away any grief and replaces it with deep satisfaction. There’s a lot to clean up with the core progression systems to make the ramp from beginning to end escalate more evenly, but I’ve enjoyed most of my hours struggling through countless generations of my goofy little bloodline. I am overjoyed the entertaining heritage of this series remains firmly intact."]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm not clever or quick enough for the micromanagement many modern real-time strategy games demand. D.O.R.F. therefore appeals. It's a nostalgic throwback to Command & Conquer and Red Alert not only in its crisp 2D sprite art and rocking soundtrack, but in its apparent focus on building towards absurd, powerful super weapons.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Saltsea Chronicles is a seafaring adventure set on a flooded world in which you choose which crew members come along on away missions and the story branches heavily throughout. It's also a bit like Star Trek, with art and writing reminiscent of its developer's previous game, Mutazione. 

If that appeals, there's now a demo available from Steam in which you can visit an island full of cats.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dead Cells joins the growing list of video games getting animated series adaptations with a show based on the popular action roguelike slated to arrive next year.
This series comes from French animation studio Bobbypills, which is also animating Netflix’s upcoming Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon-inspired Captain Laserhawk. Like the game, the plot unfolds on a cursed island consumed by a devastating plague that has warped its residents into dangerous monsters. Only a flame-headed hero of legend can set things right, even though said savior isn’t entirely thrilled with the idea. 


Dead Cells consists of 10 seven-minute-long episodes that will first air exclusively on the French anime streaming service ADN (which is co-producing the show) before becoming available worldwide. 
For more on Dead Cells, check out our impressions of its last major crossover expansion, Return to Castlevania. If you're looking for other animated series based on your favorite games, Vampire Survivors and Scott Pilgrim vs. The World are just a couple of titles with adaptations in the works.]]></summary>

But I was also keen to find out whether they considered this a reboot for the series, or whether it had any connection to the Sands Of Time trilogy, and game director Mounir Radi was happy to oblige. For him and his team, it's first and foremost "a whole new chapter" in the series, although you could call it a prequel, if you really wanted to. Whatever you do, though, don't call it a reboot. Oops.

When it was first announced on Sunday, we knew very little about the game other than it looks very pretty, and we've been eager to know more ever since. The game also opened Capcom's own showcase the next day, where the same trailer was shown and we didn't get any new information on it. Very enlightening. But luckily, some more details have dripped through, which we've summarised below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[LA is an amazing, if tremendously grey place. Everywhere you go, there are grey skyscrapers touching the clouds, so they all look like the concrete's puffing on numerous cigarettes. More often than not, cracked paving gives way to an empty lot or a vacuous car park, often with one guy slumped in a little booth ensuring it stays as grey as possible. So, what better way to commemorate grey than with a look at its president, Armored Core 6: Fires Of Rubicon?
Having seen a 20 minute presentation of the game at this year's Summer Game Fest, I'd say it struck me as an action game through and through, with the most recognisable bits of Souls soldered onto it when it came to, say, tough battles set to erratic rhythms. Honestly, I would say the hands-off demo is exactly what I expected it to be: lots of fast bits of metal slamming into each other in what was, perhaps, the least surprising FromSoftware reveal I've seen. Here's a piecemeal, slightly chaotic breakdown of the whole experience, coming to you from the frazzled mind of a jetlagged man sitting at a wobbly table.

After six years of massive open-world RPGs, Ubisoft’s long-running Assassin’s Creed franchise is returning to its stealth-based, dense city roots with Assassin’s Creed Mirage and the more I see of it, the more excited I get for October. I’ve enjoyed the series’ foray into RPGs over the years, but 2020’s Assassin’s Creed Valhalla, which took me more than 100 hours to roll credits on, left me exhausted and burnt out with what Ubisoft had done to a franchise whose games previously took 20 hours to beat.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over the past few years, Capcom has steadily been sending their beloved Ace Attorney series to modern consoles. Today, it announced it is completing the collection with Apollo Justice Ace Attorney Trilogy, out in early 2024.
The collection includes Apollo Justice Ace Attorney, originally released on the DS, as well as the series' two 3DS games, Dual Destinies and Spirit of Justice. While the games can be played in isolation, they're collectively understood to be entries four, five, and six in the Ace Attorney series, following the events of the original Phoenix Wright trilogy on the DS. The collection will include remastered HD visuals of each of the games while preserving their original styles. This means Apollo Justice Ace Attorney will still be 2D, but the latter two will feature updated 3D sprites.


The Ace Attorney series follows defense lawyers Phoenix Wright and Apollo Justice as they're tasked to defend people accused of murder. The Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney Trilogy was brought to modern consoles in 2019, and The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles (a prequel series set during the industrial revolution) came to modern consoles in 2021. Today's newest collection means all of the series' mainline games will be available to play on modern consoles.
Apollo Justice Ace Attorney Trilogy will be available early next year on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As I write this many of the development team and other members of the community are busy having fun at a meet-up in Brussels. Not me though, I’m stuck here doing a release. We’ve been busy refactoring quite a lot of the underlying code to make future changes easier, but along the way we’ve found and fixed a few more bugs and quality of life improvements that we figured were worth releasing sooner than whenever 14.0 comes along. Notably, OpenTTD will now automatically disable hardware acceleration if it detects that the last crash happened while initialising the graphics driver. While hardware acceleration works well for the vast majority of people, it causes crashes for people that then required command line arguments or manual config file editing to get it to work. This should be a better solution for those users. Additionally, there is a change to the default mouse mode on Linux to improve experience when dragging the map (and often to match expected behaviour in other games). As always, there are plenty of other bugfixes, which you can find in the changelog. While you’re at it, have you seen the post about the upcoming addition of a automated opt-in survey to OpenTTD 14? If you have opinions, we’d like to hear them! Details here. Download Changelog Bug tracker]]></summary>

The ScummVM Team is pleased to announce full support for the PC version of the first game of the Might and Magic series: Might and Magic Book One: The Secret of the Inner Sanctum. Two modes are supported:
The original look and feel of the game (sound, which in the original consisted of merely the occasional beep, is not supported)
A ScummVM-exclusive enhanced mode, which uses the interface of the later Xeen games, including niceties such as better character screens, automapping, and sound effects. It also integrates the impressive "Might and Magic 1 Graphics Overhaul Mod", which provides better in-game map and monster graphics. The xeen.cc file is required from Might and Magic: IV or Might and Magic: World of Xeen.
Both modes allow saving your game anywhere outside of combat via the ScummVM Global Main Menu (unlike the original game that only saved a single roster when checking into an inn). So make sure you save regularly, just in case you encounter problems.
Help us test both game modes by grabbing a daily build and adding mm.dat to the same folder as your game files. Read through our testing guidelines, and please take some screenshots along the way.
Now, go forth, and discover the true secrets of the game that started the long running epic fantasy series!
