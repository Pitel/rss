        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tekken 8 is just around the corner, and Bandai Namco released a glimpse of Leo's glorious combos and eccentric personality in a trailer Wednesday. Their stylish red and white jacket shines as they show off their impressive new counter. 




The German fighter Leo Kliesen is back in Tekken 8 with their Baji Quan fighting style. With their hatred of the main antagonist Kazuya Michima, it makes sense if they make an appearance in the story mode. With the codename "Seeker of Truth," they'd likely join the battle to find out more about their murdered mother and missing father. 


We didn't get many details in Tekken 7 as they were sidetracked by a love-stricken Yoshimitsu, but in Tekken 6, we learned that their mother worked for the Mishima Zaibatsu and G Corporation.


Leo is looking sharp


Not much seems to have changed with Leo's moveset, except for the previously mentioned counter. They'll still stomp their foes' toes and have an elaborate combo set up with their punches and kicks. It's been a few years since I've stepped into the shoes of Leo but one new move seems to be an impactful swirling kick in the air, which is shown in the trailer. 


They also has a new grappling hook that's used for Leo's Rage Art. Perhaps this will be used in combos too, but we haven't seen it implemented yet.


Screenshot via Bandai Namco Entertainment America's YouTube channel


The trailer also shows their adorable carefree personality as they're surprised by the Coffee Queen's name. They stagger back like an anime character as shown in the screenshot above.


We'll be able to play as the German blonde Leo when Tekken 8 releases on January 26, just a few months away. They'll be fighting against many combatants, like the first French fighter in Tekken Victor Chevalier and a mysterious Heihachi-like character named Reina, and the rest of the healthy launch roster for the new Tekken.

        <updated>2023-11-22T21:22:23.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in 2021, a PlayStation showcase announced that Aspyr was developing the often-rumored remake of Star Wars: Knights Of The Old Republic. Sadly, that was pretty much the last positive piece of news we got out of that project — up until now. 


In 2022, we learned that parent company Embracer Group had dropped Aspyr as the developer and chosen its own Saber Interactive as the replacement. A studio swap is usually troubling news, but the apparent writing on the wall came only three days ago when Giant Bomb's Jeff Grubb said that “this game is not being worked on right now.”




Luckily, however, it seems like the rumors of the KOTOR remake's death could have been exaggerated. Bloomberg's Jason Schreier has tweeted that while he doesn't know whether or not the game will ever come out, he reports from two sources at Saber Interactive that they are still working on it.




Embracer has yet to comment on the matter, so we still don't know the company's current plans for the remake. When asked about it during a recent Embracer financial presentation, CEO Lars Wingefors declined to provide a comment, saying "I notice anything I say to this becomes a headline, so that is my only comment."


We might not learn much for a while, considering how Embracer is going through a troubled period. Volition was shut down, Free Radical reportedly faces closure, and its layoffs in just one quarter have reached titanic proportions.


The situation sucks, for developers and players. People who've played the original upon release and the many more who got to experience it in the two decades that have since passed would likely love to revisit Knights of the Old Republic in a remake. But whether that will ever actually happen or not remains unclear.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Honor and glory in battle will have to wait, as Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 has been delayed for about a year. 


Publisher Focus Entertainment is holding the release to "properly polish the game." It's the common reason for delays, even though this one is certainly significant. The game was initially poised to drop late this year, but is now scheduled for "the second half of 2024." 


Focus Entertainment won't let next month be without Space Marine goodness, however. It plans to reveal the launch date "in early December" — which may mean some news during The Game Awards. We'll have to wait for December 7 to know for sure.

Space Marine 2 gets delayed, Tyranids rejoice


It would be appropriate for the publisher to reveal the date at TGA 2023, all things considered. The game was revealed during the 2021 Game Awards, delighting fans of the niche hack-and-slash game. It was welcome news. The original Space Marine graced us way back in 2011, during a time when everything was brown. It was brown, like any game of that era, but its intense combat also awarded players with plenty of satisfying red. 


Starring Captain Titus, your job was to tear through Orks with reckless abandon. It was received well and earned itself a cult following over time. Space Marine wasn't a complex game, but the mindless slaughter and spectacle made for a cathartic experience.




The sequel sees Captain Titus return, this time against a new foe. He and his fellows now face the Tyranids, basically giant space cockroaches. Based on what we've seen so far, the gameplay doesn't seem too much different than that of the original. Of course, there's no real reason to add too much and ruin a perfectly good recipe.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s hard to get excited for a new Contra game. It has been a series with some excellent ups and severe downs. As a publisher, Konami doesn't seem to be the most discriminating when it comes to handing their properties to outside developers. However, the fact that Contra: Operation Galuga is being handled by the more reliable WayForward gives reason to be optimistic.


I was given a chance to talk to Operation Galuga’s director, Tomm Hulett. Unfortunately, my optimism has been dashed. My first question was the ever-important “What is the best Contra game?”


Hulett responded, “It's gotta be the NES original. The 16-bit games especially have some amazingly memorable moments, but when you want consistent run 'n' gun perfection, there's no surpassing original Contra (though we are trying, of …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo ended a recent live stream sharing the final trailer for The Super Mario Bros. Movie with a strange and unexpected announcement. Alongside animation studio Illumination, it had teamed up with Red Wing Shoes to make Mario’s shoes from the movie, not as a line of shoes for sale, but rather a hyper-realistic version of the boots – odd proportions and all – to be displayed at the official Nintendo Store in New York City.

The interest in Mario’s shoes began with the movie’s first teaser poster, where the fidelity of Mario’s footwear blew fans away. People wanted to know more about them, which led Nintendo and Illumination to contact Red Wing Shoes, a Minnesota company specializing in work boots, about making some. “We got the call, and naturally, we’re like, ‘Well, Mario is the world’…]]></summary>

It's interesting for a look ahead being just a few months until Ubuntu 24.04 LTS and with Ubuntu 23.10 incorporating GCC 13 that will also be the default compiler of Ubunu 24.04 among other close software package versions, the kernel not too far off from what will be in this next LTS release, and with Ubuntu 23.10's Linux 6.5 kernel bringing some nice performance optimizations. So with that said I recently wrapped up some fresh benchmarks looking at the current generation Intel Xeon Scalable Sapphire Rapids performance against AMD EPYC 9004 Bergamo, Genoa, and Genoa-X processors.]]></summary>

Initially showcased in the THQ Nordic Digital Showcase 2023 presentation, we have today got a better look at the upcoming 3D battler South Park: Snow Day! which is set to be thrown onto Switch in 2024.
We didn't get all that much about the game from the initial reveal (apart from a sense of dread at seeing another 3D South Park game), but today's trailer gives a slightly better idea of what this one will be all about.

Modern consoles might be able to provide great visuals and a wide library of games (though still both inferior to the PC) but no controller can match the precision and reactivity of your keyboard's smaller, nimbler sidekick. Whether you're playing fast-paced RTS' like StarCraft 2 or twitchy shooters like Apex Legends, a great mouse can be the difference between virtual life and death. And for Black Friday, one of the very best gaming mice is going cheap, rather than squeak.

Founded in 1974, Irem, then known as IPM Co. Ltd, began as a distributor and assembler of arcade machines for general stores and other small independent businesses. It wasn’t until 1978 that the relabelled company released its own software.
Despite being shoot-'em-up focused, the Irem Collection Volume 1 sidesteps R-Type, the obvious choice, to deliver three alternative titles and their associated ports. Image Fight is a 1988 arcade game that made a strong impression in Japan. Although not instantly apparent owing to its extreme difficulty, it’s a brilliantly executed game that demands deconstruction, and famously inspired Hiroshi Iuichi in conceiving Treasure’s Radiant Silvergun.

Another Omen 17 variant, still with an RTX 4080 GPU (but trading an even more powerful Intel chip for less RAM and storage), is also getting the Black Friday treatment in the US. Albeit with a $500 saving, which I understand is not as Big a Number, and is thus less deserving of going in the headline.

Update : You might remember a few weeks ago, we flagged the latest project from YouTube channel RwanLink, which saw Zelda: Ocarina of Time's Castle Town reimagined in the style of a Studio Ghibli film. We only had a teaser to show you at the time, but now the channel has released the finished product and it's a beauty.
The above film was released yesterday to mark the 25th anniversary of the game (we're coining the phrase Ocarinaversary and waiting to see if it catches on) and it shows exactly what the animator's 600+ hours of work have been spent on — Malon and Talon, Ganondorf and more OOT references than you could fit in an Adult Wallet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Larian Studios has handed an ‘L’ straight to scalpers by affirming that the Baldur’s Gate 3 Deluxe Edition is not limited, and there “won’t be stock scarcity” when it ships in early-2024.




Michael Douse (a.k.a. "Cromwelp"), director of publishing at Larian Studios, said in a post via Twitter that “stock is holding steady,” and that there will be more waves of shipments “being prepared within the Q1 2024 shipping window.” Douse said this to dissuade anyone from buying the Deluxe Edition from online resellers.


“We confirmed a minimum order but we already blitzed past that in the first day, and the Q1 shipping date allows us to simply increase wave sizes without jeapordizing [sic] the shipping date so we expect any issues within that 4 month buffer window,” Douse continued.




This news comes a short time after Larian announced Baldur’s Gate 3 would be receiving a complete on-disc physical version in the form of a Deluxe Edition. For $79.99, players can net a physical copy of Baldur’s Gate 3, plus a bundle of physical merchandise including a mind flayer poster, a deluxe edition box, an original soundtrack, a world map, 32 stickers and 2 patches.


It makes sense that some might assume this Deluxe Edition to be limited given everything included, but now we can say unequivocally that it’s not. So, don’t give the scalpers the validation and buy from Larian directly. What doesn’t make sense is buying something for $160 that is guaranteed to be half that.


Baldur’s Gate 3’s deluxe physical edition is scheduled to ship in Q1 2024, and will be available for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and PC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you are in the mood for a game about dancing around screens full of energy beams and projectiles, searching for that fleeting window of space in which you can stop and perform an attack, I recommend trying the demo for Ninja Issen. If you miss 8 or 16-bit platformers like Shinobi or the original Ninja Gaiden, I also recommend trying the demo for Ninja Issen. If you liked The Messenger - classique Ninja Gaiden's greatest heir - but wished it was More Cyberpunk with cheesy PG-rated holographic dancing girls and Comix Zone-style story panels, I also also recommend trying the demo for Ninja Issen. 


Out today, it's the work of solo Korean dev Asteroid-J, and based on the first level, is pretty decent. It does have quite a lot of dialogue for a ninja platformer, but the dialogue is tongue-in-cheek, and hopefully it'll fall by the wayside as you push beyond the tutorial sections.

It was quite a long list, all things considered, I will probably still end up making another one by the time this year's annual meat snooze rolls around, too. 2023 has arguably been stuffed with even more good games than we had last year, and I will be the first to admit that my eyes are, indeed, frequently too big for what I can feasibly hope to play in any given month.
But I also thought it would also be fun to get ahead of the game slightly by turning some of my remaining supporter posts for the year into a kind of extended I'M SORRY: 2023 Edition series, talking about games I have actually liked and played, but which a) didn't end up making it onto my personal GOTY list (just to keep you Advent Calender guessing gamers on your toes), and b) we also weren't able to review on the site, either due to lack of time, code or, well, no, it's really just time. Time is our eternal enemy. And the first game I'd like to talk about is Tron: Identity.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Subscribers to Nintendo Switch Online's highest tier, the expansion pack, have access to an ever-growing catalog of modern and classic games, including a small library of N64 games. In December, that expansion pack is expanding a little more, as Jet Force Gemini is coming to the service.
First released in 1999, Jet Force Gemini is a third-person shooter developed by Rare, the studio originally known for the Banjo-Kazooie games, but most recently known for Sea of Thieves. It's set on a sci-fi alien world, where players blast through hordes of insect-like creatures.
The most recent way players could experience the game on modern consoles was through Rare Replay, a compilation of classic Rare games released on the Xbox One in 2015.  For a refresher on the game, check out this 60-second rundown Rare put out a few years back.


The Switch Online currently includes 26 other N64 games, including the recently added Excitebike 64. It also includes Game Boy Advance games, Sega Genesis games, and DLC content for popular Switch titles, like Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and Animal Crossing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We're not far off having our eyeballs exposed to the first official GTA 6 trailer. Until then, let's talk about the classic games in Rockstar's iconic series. Hey, did you know there was a point when Vice City (easily the best entry – I will fight you all) nearly wasn't its own game?


According to a blog post from Obbe Vermeij – former technical director at Rockstar Games – the follow-up to Grand Theft Auto 3 was just going to be a mission pack. Vermeij said the team had the idea to have a game set in the 80s in Miami. But it wasn't until GTA 3 became as successful as it did that a decision was made to turn Vice City into a standalone entry.




The original project was already six months into development, but artists and level designers were "able to get straight onto" the next in-line for the GTA franchise. Despite it being built off the third game's engine, Vermeij remembers VC being "more stressful" than Grand Theft Auto 3.


But wait...there's more


In an earlier blog, we learn that the studio was keen to try something non-GTA. Inspired by the undead, Rockstar wanted to run with the idea of creating a zombie game that would have been built off the Vice City code.


Vermeij describes the elusive project called "Z" (pronounced either "Zed" or "Zee") thus:



The game was to take place on a windswept foggy Scottish island. The player would be under constant attack from zombies. The player would need to use vehicles to get around but vehicles would need fuel. Acquiring the fuel would be a big part of the game.




Sadly, Z was abandoned a month into development as it was "depressing," and the team got to work on San Andreas. Swings and roundabouts, I suppose.

A fair few of the tweaks this time around seem to focus on the game's UI, though the update targets a range of issues including localisations, cutscenes, difficulty modifiers and more.

Whether it's Travis Scott, Lebron James, or Patrick Mahomes, it's become a sort of Hollywood Star of Fame to be featured in Epic Games' hit shooter. Today. Marshall Mathers joins the club – Eminem is coming to Fortnite. 
The Grammy winner will be added to the game's item shop on November 29. The image above shows the three versions of the rapper that will be available for purchase. From left to right, they're called Rap Boy, Slim Shady, and Marshall Never More. This release comes a few days ahead of Fortnite's Big Bang event, which is set to happen on December 2 at 2 PM Eastern. Alongside whatever world-altering event phenomena Epic plans to introduce, Eminem will be performing a live concert. Attendees will receive the Big Bang loading screen, featured at the head of this article.
Fortnite has been in gaming news a lot recently, thanks to the rollout of Fortnite OG, a record-setting new season that throws players back in time to the earliest maps in the game. It's also come under fire for new rules about which skins are allowed in certain creator-made worlds: you can see their response to this controversy here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Oh, it's been a trying time for developers, especially those who've been hurt by Unity's recent new controversial fees. As a result, many have been hightailing it outta there, looking for alternatives. In the midst of all this, one company has decided to engage in some savvy business acumen.


GameMaker has decided to go in the opposite direction and make itself free. A recent post on the company's website is celebrating Thanksgiving by offering a free-to-use license for non-commercial purposes. On top of this, there's also a new "one-time fee" for a commercial license, replacing its Creator/Indie subscriptions, while Enterprise remains the same.




While it can't be assumed that this is in direct response to Unity's "Runtime Fee," GameMaker head Russell Kay says the team has seen "other platforms making awkward moves with their pricing and terms," so saw fit to go in the other direction. Mum's the word, Kay. Mum's the word.


If you haven't heard of it, you soon will


Offering support for all kinds of platforms, including Android, iOS, Amazon TV, Raspberry Pi, as well as Windows and modern consoles, GameMaker is one more alternative for developers to use.


If you've ever played Hotline Miami or Undertale (or both), then you've played a GameMaker title before. And with free usage for non-commercial endeavors being offered, there's probably going to be a few more people eager to jump ship.


As for what's going on with Unity at the moment, alongside the carnage it's created, the company may also be laying off staff. You know, that thing that's been a plague on the industry this year and is almost certainly going to make people dislike Unity even more? Yeah, that thing.

The main source of revenue today is smartphones; a levy of roughly 17 euros per sale means an annual payout to rightsholders of almost €300m. Alongside the streaming explosion and a system unchanged for a decade, one that critics describe as "dysfunctional", the levy now faces renewed scrutiny.

Whilst there's absolutely no doubt as to the continued popularity of the Jurassic Park/World franchise in 2023, the Jurassic Park: Classic Games Collection from Limited Run Games, which features a total of seven titles from the 8- and 16-bit eras exclusively, is a bit of a lacklustre offering for eager dino fans, one that focuses on a selection of titles that don't particularly stand up very well to any sort of scrutiny 30 years down the line.
Yes, that's right. 30 years. 2023 marks the 30th anniversary of the release of Steven Spielberg's blockbusting dino-spectacular, a film that had the 15-year-old version of this particular writer busy cutting out hundreds of pictures of half-naked Jeff Goldblum from movie magazines, collecting any and all related dino tat, and developing an unhealthy obsession with how plausible it would be to fight and defeat a raptor barehanded (we were also very good at mimicking the mating call of a Gallimimus, but perhaps that's a story for another time).

Earlier today, we learnt that Rare's Jet Force Gemini would be headed to the N64 Nintendo Switch Online service next month. While Western audiences will be able to play the game via the normal app, Nintendo has revealed that things will be slightly different in Japan, as the region will soon be receiving a special 18+ variant of the console-specific app (thanks, VGC).
As shown in the above reveal trailer, the new adults-only N64 NSO app will launch in Japan with both Jet Force Gemini and GoldenEye 007 (which Western audiences got hold of earlier this year) on 30th November.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Doom always takes the crown, but that doesn't detract from Wolfenstein 3D's influence as a key part of FPS history. The series is still going to this day (maybe not as strong in some cases), and people are continuing to modify the OG 1992 release.


For example, "Blazkowicz's Text Adventure 3D" is a different take on Wolfenstine 3D. Created by user TryHardWolfers, it essentially turns the game into a text adventure. By that, I don't mean it converts the shooter into prose, dialogue, and reams of exposition. Rather, what it does is replace every single texture with a word.


Image via TryHardWolfers/ModDB.


Walls are simply described as "BRICK WALLS," hanging lights are dubbed "LAMPS," and the machine gun you carry...well, you get the idea. There's even a screenshot showing that the picture of Adolf Hitler has been changed into words. You can download the mod from ModDB.


It's a wordy one


 As TryHardWolfers says, this "text tale is filled to the brim with well-worded action and tense text map design." It's almost as if we've come full circle, taking the immediacy and immersion of a 3D rendered environment and broken it down into a text adventure of ye olden days.


With Wolfenstein 3 said to be in development, there's seemingly no stopping B.J. Blazkowicz and his Nazi-killing antics. With the first game in the series releasing all the way back in 1981 (developed by Muse Software, 11 years before id's 3D take on it), battling against the Third Reich is evidently something that just doesn't go out of style.

I've just finished (well, reached a grisly end within) the demo for Chiyo, a first-person horror game from Nimbus Games, set in Edo era Japan, in which you are a plucky young mystic sent by the Tokugawa Shogunate's Magical Arcane Division to investigate and cleanse a spooky abandoned mansion on the coast. 


Much like the protagonist of fellow Japan-set exor-simulator Ghostwire: Tokyo, you have a brace of occult, gesture-based powers with which to explore and, hopefully, vanquish any lurking spirits, but so far, the only ones I've gotten access to are a funky finger torch, the ability to unseal cursed doors, and the ability to see glowing puzzle props through surfaces. I very much do not feel like an Edo era John Constantine. I don't even feel like an Edo era Scooby Doo. I mean, at least he was good at running away: the titular Chiyo waddles about like she's worried her trousers are about to fall down.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Celebrate the festive season Remedy style with Saga Anderson's cozy sweater. With the studio's knitting guide, you'll have a sweater of your own in no time. 


The guide is adequately detailed, giving you charts for each of the patterns on the sweater, as well as measurements and different yarn colors. Remedy has described the sweater as "distinctly Nordic." 


If you want to really nail Saga's look, you can also follow Remedy's cosplay guide. It covers all the details you might need including her hairstyle, gun holster, and stylish FBI jacket. 


Saga is seen in a couple of outfits in Alan Wake 2. She usually wears her FBI jacket, but you also catch her in a blue Oh Deer! sweater. There's also a red jacket available for her if you've purchased the deluxe edition of the game.

Season's greetings from Remedy


It's no surprise to see the guide coming from the Finnish studio, as knitting is a beloved pastime in the country, as well as in other neighboring Nordic countries, including Sweden which is part of Saga's ancestry.


This isn't the first time Remey has attempted to get its fans into the festive spirit. Notably, in 2015, Sam Lake appeared in a somewhat unsettling video wishing players happy holidays while teasing a bit of what was to come in both Quantum Break and, quite interestingly, Alan Wake 2 as well. 




If you do decide to purchase Alan Wake 2's deluxe edition, you'll receive the game's two upcoming DLCs. The first one, Night Springs, is scheduled to arrive in Spring 2024.

As The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time marks its 25th anniversary, folks the world over have been celebrating Nintendo's seminal N64 masterpiece.
Going one step further, however, Curiomatic, a collective of creative minds, has showcased its vision of what Link might look like if he were faithfully recreated in Unreal Engine 5. Dubbed 'Ocarina of Time Visual Remake', the video above demonstrates the final result of the project while looking back on the entire creative process.

It's like watching somebody upend a bucket of termites over the world's most elaborate model trainset.
The associated Rise of the Dark Fog update is out on 15th December. Youthcat have put together a nifty announcement trailer that makes cunning use of the ability to raze factories from orbit - I'm curious to know if it was actually performed in-game.

Update: Well, there's a turn-up for the books. Nintendo has announced that Jet Force Gemini is coming to the Switch Online Expansion Pack in December. We've got to say, of all Rare's N64 games, we didn't fancy this one's chances — as you'll see below — but we're very happy Switch gamers will be able to access this particular gem.
In honour of the news, we're republishing this article from earlier in the year as a reminder of Rare's remaining N64 jewels that could, potentially, still come to NSO. If you didn't vote in the poll back in January, it's still functioning at the bottom of the page, so feel free to join in — and congratulations to the 5% of Jet Force Gemini lovers out there!

A simplified climbing mode has been added which allows you to climb using joysticks alone instead of your controller triggers. A no stamina mode is also included and it deactivates the stamina mechanic. In addition to color blindness options, there is an alternate rappel mode, a simplified interactions mode, and jump assistance. 


Although these changes are geared towards allowing players with differing abilities to access the game, you don't need to have dexterity or sight impairments to enjoy the new features. Turning on the no stamina mode and simplified climbing …]]></summary>

It doesn't seem like Miura is bitter about leaving, as his translated Tweet states that he has no regrets, and he thinks Nintendo is an incredible company. Nevertheless, he wouldn't recommend it lightly. Though the company is ideal for geniuses, Miura felt as though he wasn't cut out for the environment. Ultimately, he discovered that he "wasn’t suited for the role," which has given him the confidence to pursue other goals.

This isn't the first time Destiny has seen a crossover with another franchise, but it's certainly among the more high-profile, right along with the previous Sony crossover. That collaboration introduced armor sets inspired by God of War, Horizon Zero Dawn, and Ghost of Tsushima. The next set of Guardian cosmetics adds more armor to your closet, along with a finisher, Ghost shell, ship, Sparrow, and emote.

It's been roughly two years since fans dove into the chilly waters of the series, and it feels like it's nearly time to strap back into that diving suit once more. And then get eaten by a Reaper Leviathan.


As spotted by RPS, the game's potential launch window came out of a recent financial report by publisher Krafton. Details are sparse and will continue to be so until the company is ready to announce the game proper. It's currently unknown if the next Subnautica in 2025 is set to be a spin-off or sequel, but judging by the development time, it's likely going to be the latter. Of course, that's just speculation. But isn't it fun to imagine?

The next Subnautica has been in the works for some time now. We last heard of it back in April 2022 when developer Unknown Worlds advertised a Senior Narrative Designer position on Twitter. Since then, fans of its signature undersea horror themes have been waiting to know more. If the game is scheduled for a release in the first half of 2025, I wouldn't expect to see any reveal until Summer Game Fest next year at the very earliest. It should at least make for a good addition to a prediction list. 


As noted by RPS, the financial report covered some future Krafton projects. Project Gold Rush is an "Action-Adventure Sandbox" set to launch in the first half of 2025, much like the new Subnautica. The publisher also listed a Dark and Darker mobile game, Project inZOI, and Project Black Budget all under development for 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Star Wars: Empire At War wasn't a great game, but it did fulfill a simple fantasy: it was a real-time strategy game with original trilogy Star Wars units. If what you wanted was to fling swarms of AT-ATs against swarms of X-Wings then, yeah, you could do that. Darth Vader versus entire platoons of rebel soldiers? That too.

Why am I talking about a 2006 RTS? Because it just got a new official patch to make it run in 64-bit and fix a number of bugs.

Before I was even in high school, I had a binder full of designs for a game I had dreamt up, but I never really got the means to even attempt to make it. Programming has always bored me, and I tend to get frustrated with art. Even attempts at small projects to just motivate myself with some visible progress fizzled.


The closest I got was a brief stint writing for a game company. I co-wrote a game that is still unannounced and may, at this point, be canceled. I’m not sure. However, I got the gig at the lowest point of my life, and it gave me something to focus on. I’ve always wanted to return to doing it, but again, there’s a wall I have to climb over to make any progress.

That's because it's a Metroidvania platformer and, when it is time for back-and-forth combat, you're not choosing attacks from a menu. Instead you're stringing together combos in real-time, then when your alotted attack time is over, you're parrying enemy assaults with rhythmic flair. 

So, turn-based, yes, but with a twist. It's also out today.

        <updated>2023-11-21T21:47:12.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Epic Game Store's Black Friday sale 2023 has kicked off, bringing plenty of discounts for games. Most notably, Epic is offering a 33% off coupon during the sale, which can be applied toward Alan Wake 2. 


The Epic Coupon can be used throughout the event. It lets buyers take 33% off any checkout purchase that rings up to $14.99 or more. Even though Alan Wake 2 is already set at a reasonable $49.99, using the coupon during the sale will drop it to an even more reasonable $33.49 USD. I may be biased, but that's a damn good deal for a very recently launched GOTY contender. It's a fantastic game that can last you up to around 30 hours. 





Alan Wake 2 and more are on sale at the Epic Games Store


The Epic Coupon seems to be pretty much the sale of the Epic Games Store Black Friday sale. You can find a host of games at a discount, but the coupon itself seems to be what's taking off the big, meaty chunks. The rules of the coupon state that it can be used at checkout, and you'll get another every time you "complete an eligible transaction." And by that, Epic means any purchase, solo or combined, that adds up to $14.99 or more. Likely, that means you can apply it to Assassin's Creed Mirage Deluxe Edition, even though it's already listed at 20% off. 


Having both games already on such a steep sale isn't such bad news. The year has been full of bangers, so some may at least appreciate the softer hit on their wallets. 


The Epic Games Store Black Friday sale lasts from November 21 at 11 am ET to November 28 at 10:59 am ET. 


At the other side of the aisle, the Steam Store has also started Black Friday shenanigans with its Autumn Sale, which also lasts until November 28.

The closed Suicide Squad playtest cracks off next week. WB Games sent out the invite earlier today, allowing some a chance to sign up ahead of time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 players rejoice, because Sledgehammer Games has announced it will be temporarily disabling the infamous Gaia Operator outfit, known in the community as the “Groot” skin, so it can make some changes. 


In a recent Reddit AMA, the developer said “adjustments” for this outfit are “in the pipeline.” In response to one user asking what the studio’s plans were regarding the “problems [the skin] has brought forward to [Modern Warfare 3] from [Modern Warfare 2],” it responded confirming the fixes were incoming, and that the Gaia and Gaia Blackcell Operator skins will be disabled in a future update until the changes are ready to be deployed.


The Gaia / “Groot” skin has been plaguing Modern Warfare 2 players since its launch in late-September alongside Season 6. While it does closely resemble the tree-like creature in the Guardians of the Galaxy films, it’s advertised as “an earthen form of Mother Nature herself.” It would seem the major issue most players have with this skin is that, due to the nature of being a bundle of tree branches, the camouflage allowed it to blend in too well with its surroundings.


The alternate skin for Nova was adjusted in an October 11 patch which “added VFX to base skin that reflects the same level of visibility as BlackCell skin,” and “improved visibility compensation,” but some fans aren’t happy. Since the skin has made the jump to Modern Warfare 3, fans have taken to Reddit to accuse the skin of being pay-to-win and questioning how it hasn’t been fixed yet. Here’s hoping the team at Sledgehammer Games gives this skin a complete overhaul and alleviates players’ concerns. Because I think the skin looks really neat — if only it could not be broken on a fundamental level.

Little Goody Two Shoes combines both concepts into a game, taking a cottagecore lesbian life sim and combining it with exploration-based survival horror. I never knew I needed a mashup like this until this game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CCP Games has revealed that the "First Strike" live event for EVE Vanguard will kick off on December 7. The online playtest is for EVE Vanguard, the upcoming sandbox FPS module that will connect to the long-running MMORPG EVE Online.

Persistent Universe with EVE Online


According to CCP Games, EVE Vanguard will connect directly to the EVE universe from Day One with a persistent new world. Players in Vanguard will be able to fuel the ongoing wars in the EVE Online MMO allowing players to add corruption to the frontlines, deliver vital resources to the EVE economy, and complete contracts to alter the tides of battles.


The playtest will last for four days, beginning at midday UTC on December 7 and ending at midday UTC on December 11. Any EVE Online Omega subscriber will have the opportunity to join the playtest by choosing EVE Vanguard character profile via the EVE launcher once the playtest begins.


New Patch for Havoc


Alongside news of the EVE Vanguard playtest, CCP Games also revealed an upcoming patch for the latest EVE Online expansion, Havoc. Highlights of the patch include:



Lifted restrictions on EverMark trading, reinstating players’ in-game transaction freedoms.


Dynamic, in-game music that adapts to the unfolding narratives of corruption and suppression.


Quality of Life improvements for Corporation Projects.



I'm excited to see what EVE Vanguard is all about. Years ago when CCP Games tried this before with Dust 514, the concept itself was very intriguing but felt like maybe it was a bit before its time. Now, however, technology is in the right place to make a truly persistent online shooter that ties in directly with an ongoing MMORPG.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The World Ends With You fan artist @caehum on Twitter has showcased what Neku would look like in an HD remake or possibly Kingdom Hearts 4 through an immaculate 3D render. Since its publishing on Monday, it has received over 2,500 likes.




The 3D model looks like it's ripped straight from a modern Kingdom Hearts game, and has plenty of detail around the face and the odd jacket that Neku wears. The more realistic take on Neku is quite different from the most recent game NEO: The World Ends With You, which takes on a graphic novel art style instead. 


The World Remade With You


It would be cool to see a realistic take on the original DS game through a remake in the future. It has been re-released on Switch with a Final Remix version, however, to mixed results. 


"Final Remix‘s failure to utilize the extent of the Switch hardware shows a lack of understanding as to why so many people consider the Nintendo DS original to be the masterpiece it is," said our review.




Neku is expected to appear in Kingdom Hearts 4 by some fans. In Kingdom Hearts: Dream Drop Distance, Neku and Sora promise to see each other in Shibuya. After the events of KH3, Sora actually ends up in an area inspired by the real-life location. We could see Neku in a model like this, in an official capacity.


If you don't know where Neku comes from, he's the main character of a cult classic JRPG called The World Ends With You. It's one of the highest-rated DS games at an 88 Metacritic score. There was then a follow-up sequel called NEO: The World Ends With You featuring a new character named Rindo. 


"NEO: The World Ends with You is a sequel worth waiting for," said our 8/10 review. "It brings together many of the best concepts from the DS original but in a more approachable and accessible experience."

Few manufacturers understand this better than Logitech, whose G915 Lightspeed Wireless keyboard has been the ideal way to type without tethers for years. It combines a slim yet robust build quality with wonderfully tactile keys, incredibly fast response times, respectable battery life, and a truly standout volume wheel. Perhaps for that reason, the G915 Lightspeed has also maintained its lofty price point, with an RRP of around £220. But as part of Amazon's Black Friday sale, you can currently grab the best wireless keyboard for almost half price. It's currently available for £125 in the UK, and $160 in the US, which is 46% and 36% off respectively.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A pair of dungeon-crawlers are about to make their way back to adventurers around the world with the announcement of Class of Heroes 1 & 2: Complete Edition for PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, and PC.


The collection includes Class of Heroes: Anniversary Edition and Class of Heroes 2G: Remastered. Both will be available together on consoles and sold separately on Steam. There's no release date in place, but PQube has them penciled in for an early 2024 launch. You can see how the updated RPGs look today in the announcement trailer. 




Developer Zero Div's series first opened its doors to students when the original Class of Heroes hit PSP in Japan back in 2008. A North American release followed in 2009, which is also when the sequel launched in Japan. The Anniversary Edition version of the first game made its debut in Switch in Japan in 2018, adding in a room for changing outfits, difficulty options, and more.


Class of Heroes 2G introduced some new features when it made its way to PlayStation 3 in 2010. Additional party members, new dungeons, and full voiceovers joined the mix, giving players more reason to go back to the grind. With both games combined there are over 175 dungeons to traverse, so now's a good time to invest in some knee and elbow pads if you plan on crawling through 'em all.

HoYoverse kindly provided me with a ticket to the concert, so I hurried on over to the Peacock Theater and arrived at the venue about half an hour before the doors opened.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fortnite has just announced its Big Bang event, and there are already reports circulating that Eminem is one of many surprises in store. 


According to Fortnite leaker @HYPEX, the upcoming Big Bang event will be the multiplayer game's largest to date, weighing over 1.5 GB. In addition to providing the artwork featuring an animated version of the rapper, the leaker also claims LEGO will make an appearance, and there'll also be a rhythm mode and racing mode. 


According to @HYPEX, the rhythm mode will let you play vocals, guitar, drums, and bass. It comes December 9, and you can expect the following artists and songs to be featured: 



Alice Cooper - 'Poison'


Imagine Dragons - 'Thunder'


Lady Gaga - 'Pokerface'


Linkin Park - 'Numb'


Toto - 'Africa'



Another leaker, @iFireMonkey, revealed two Eminem skins. One has the rapper with his iconic blond hair, while the other has him in the suit and fedora he wears on his Music to be Murdered By album.




As for official details, all we know so far is that Epic has the event planned for Saturday, December 2, 2023, at 2 PM ET. It'll be available in the Battle Royale tile in Discover 30 minutes prior, and it'll support parties of up to four players. It's being described as "a new beginning," which may explain why Fortnite is going all-out. 




For those who don't have a dedicated gaming device, you can use NVIDIA GeForce NOW and Amazon Luna services to access the game via cloud gaming. 


This won't be the first major music event from Fortnite. Past concerts have featured artists like Travis Scott and Ariane Grande, and the experience has been an interactive one allowing you to enjoy a virtual concert from the comfort of your home.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Oh biscuits!
Given Bluey’s meteoric rise since the show's television debut in 2018, it seemed inevitable that a video game adaptation would eventually make its way into the hands of eager fans worldwide. Thanks to developer Artax Games and publisher Outright, that adaptation is now here, with Bluey: The Videogame letting you directly control each member of the Heeler family: Bandit, Chilli, Bingo, and of course, Bluey. It’s a charming effort that manages to successfully emulate the Australian cartoon in terms of visuals and audio, but falls deeply short of capturing the same magic. Despite this, young children will still likely get a kick out of the experience, but more on that later.
Taking place across five locations from the show, including the Heeler household, the backyard, the beach, the playground, and the creek, Bluey: The Videogame tells a short, reasonably wholesome story in which the family goes in search of Bandit’s lost childhood treasure. When we say “short”, however, we mean it: the game’s story is split into four episodes, and each of these will take roughly around 10-15 minutes to complete. So you can make your way through the entire game in about an hour, tops. Add in the various collectibles and you might be able to stretch it to two hours, but that’s it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Can you believe we're coming up to three years since Cyberpunk 2077 released? What a rollercoaster it's been for CD Projekt Red's non-Witcher game, and soon you'll be able to own a special Ultimate Edition version of the dystopian RPG.


In a recent post on CDPR's website, the developer has said it will be launching the Ultimate Edition of Cyberpunk 2077 for Xbox Series X|S, PS5, and PC. It's releasing digitally and as a physical purchase, both of which will be available from December 5.




As for what's in it, well, you'll get the OG game (natch), along with the free 2.0 update that overhauled a lot of stuff, and the one and only DLC, Phantom Liberty. It's basically an all-in-one package, if that's what you're after in time for Christmas.


We can forgive, but can we forget?


As time goes on, it becomes easier to talk about Cyberpunk without having to remind ourselves of the bad old days. However, I'd wager it's a sting that's still felt by many, especially for those of us who tried to play it on console when it released.


Things are, thankfully, much different now. The aforementioned 2.0 update was just one of the ways CD Projekt Red made some key changes to the game, improving things along the way. Before that was the rather substantial patch 1.5 that rolled out in February 2022.


In short: we've finally arrived. However, it's at a time when the studio is looking to move onto new things. While we're getting a Cyberpunk follow-up and a new Witcher saga, CDPR has also said that 2077 is getting no more major updates.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I genuinely despise writing negative reviews. There are real human beings behind every project, and bad games are seldom the product of moral failings, but instead are typically caused by an unfortunate convergence of factors both predictable and otherwise. 


With that said, the gaming industry isn't a charity, and people deserve to know what they're potentially spending their hard-earned money on. Here's what you need to know: the problem with Flashback 2 isn't merely that it is buggy, sometimes to a hilarious degree. Instead, the main issue is that even if the bugs weren't present, it still wouldn't be worth its current price tag. 


Flashback 2 (PC, PS5 [reviewed], Xbox Series X/S)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Petroglyph Games is still patching Star Wars: Empire at War all these years later. The game originally launched in 2006. The newest patch was released on November 20, 2023.


The latest patch is for maintenance, but it makes a rather significant change: it shifts the game from a 32-bit executable to a 64-bit one to try and solve out-of-memory bugs. Beyond that, it addresses out-of-sync multiplayer issues and “numerous gameplay fixes addressing balance and incorrect unit behavior.”


It’s impressive. Some of my favorite games of that era aren’t even available for purchase anymore, let alone getting continued support. Petroglyph states that they worked with the community to locate and address some of the bugs fixed in this release.

I’m somewhat surprised that they’re still able to patch the game. Not that I think Petroglyph wouldn’t want to since it was the studio’s first game and one that still gets played today. It’s just that, since the license belongs to another company, oftentimes there’s little incentive to offer continued support and other times they’re contractually not allowed to make changes after a certain period. Nevertheless, such a major update so long after Star Wars: Empire at War’s initial release is an impressive showing of passion from the developer. In a world without official Battlefield 1942 servers, it's nice to be reminded that some people still care.


While I was in high school playing StarCraft, I dreamed of a Star Wars RTS. I don’t know why I didn’t play Star Wars: Galactic Battleground, but by 2006, the prequel trilogy had left me badly disillusioned with the franchise. I have never recovered, and at this point, probably never will.


However, I may install Star Wars: Empire at War to check the game out now.


Star Wars: Empire at War is available for PC. The newest update is available now.

Like the Attic bug in Jet Set Willy, for example, which made the game impossible to complete, or the unfeasibly strict time limit in a level of Robocop on the Commodore 64, which legend has it was reduced intentionally to hide glitches on the subsequent stage. Indeed, the chances of seeing the final parts of Flashback 2 in its current state seem so remote, you have to wonder what state they’d be in when you got there.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After four seasons of brand new content, Epic Games injected a healthy dose of nostalgia into Fornite Chapter 4's fifth season, officially called Season OG, by bringing back the Chapter 1 map for players to experience once more. Season OG has included weekly updates to add items from Chapter 1's various seasons, too, making it a fun romp through what Fortnite was like years ago. However, Season OG ends on December 2, which is also when Fortnite's next live event, The Big Bang, goes live. 
The Big Bang begins on Saturday, December 2, at 11 a.m. PT/2 p.m. ET, and Epic says, "This event marks a new beginning for Fortnite." 
✅ Unforgettable event

November 21, 2023
Before the event begins, Epic says players will see The Big Bang in the Battle Royale tile in the Discover section of Fortnite 30 minutes prior to its start; that way, you can jump in before the event starts to link up with friends and get your cosmetics in order. And speaking of friends, The Big Bang will support parties of up to four players. 
The Big Bang will be available anywhere you play the most current build of Fortnite, including PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC. If you won't be near a dedicated gaming device during the event, you can check it out using Xbox Cloud Gaming, Nvidia GeForce Now, and Amazon Luna services to play Fortnite via cloud streaming on your computer or mobile device. 
"To prepare for The Big Bang, Fortnite experiences made by Epic will be disable starting 12 p.m. ET on December 2," Epic writes in a blog post. "Creator-made experiences will remain enabled until downtime for Fortnite v28.00 starts at 11:30 p.m. ET."
While waiting for The Big Bang event, read up on everything you need to know about Fortnite Chapter 4: Season OG, and then read about how Epic says it's aware it missed the mark with a recent cosmetic restriction update for Fortnite.

        <updated>2023-11-21T14:18:53.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in 2021, it was announced that Knights of the Old Republic would be getting an official remake, with plans to release it on PC and PS5. However, things have not been going swimmingly for KOTOR's return, and if you've clicked on this headline, you already know where this is going.


A few days ago, Giant Bomb's own Jeff Grubb claimed that "this game is not being worked on right now." And by "this game," he definitely means the remake of Knights of the Old Republic. He goes on to say that no studio anywhere is currently developing it. The discussion begins around the 31-minute mark.




Grubb also adds that fans may have already been picking up the pieces, and it certainly seems like Embracer Group is sitting on this long-awaited game. However, nothing official has been claimed yet regarding the remake, so take this information at face value for now.


Embrace for disappointment


KOTOR is in the care of Saber Interactive, which is owned by Embracer Group. Last week, Embracer CEO was not willing to pass comment on the status of Knights of the Old Republic. And last year, there was another report about the remake being put on hold, so at this stage, it's safe to assume the project is likely in development hell.


It's a bit of a shame really. The original 2003 release – which was made by BioWare of Mass Effect fame – is considered to be one of the best Star Wars video adaptations of all time. To see it make a comeback at a time when remakes and remasters are still in vogue feels like Embracer with its figurative finger so far from the pulse, it's levitating.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sometimes an indie game can come out of nowhere and cover itself in glory, even for a bit. Zeekerss co-op survival horror title Lethal Company is just such a game, and it's currently taking the PC world by storm.


According to the latest Top Sellers chart over on Steam, it's ranking as the best game in terms of revenue. This puts it at the number two spot overall, just behind the Steam Deck. Seeing it climb up from sixth place in a matter of weeks is hugely impressive, especially because there seemed to be little hype surrounding it.


Screenshot via Destructoid.


It was also revealed yesterday that Lethal Company had smashed 100,000 concurrent players. Well, according to data pulled from SteamDB, that record has been smashed again. At the time of writing, it's now at a peak of 117,278, which it achieved less than 12 hours ago.


Pretty good going for a small indie title


Sons of the Forest experienced a similar burst in popularity so quickly after it was released. Selling two million copies in its first 24 hours, the follow-up to the 2017 horror game The Forest was a phenomenal success. Admittedly, it didn't last too long, and there are currently 6,618 people playing right now. In contrast, Lethal Company is recording just over 19,000 players.


For those who have yet to play it (yo!), Lethal Company is a cooperative horror title that tasks players with scavenging items on abandoned moons in order to sell them to an entity known as the Company.


It's been out for a month and it's already showing "Overwhelmingly Positive" reviews on Steam. It's still in early access so no doubt the studio has a lot of work ahead of it. Still, this surprise horror hit is something fans of the genre may want to keep an eye on, especially those who enjoy things like Rust or Dead by Daylight.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The sequel to the masterful Cities: Skylines is now out, but it didn't quite stick the landing. 


Even though Cities: Skylines 2 shows great promise, it also suffers from various performance issues that developer Colossal Order Ltd. was aware of before its release. The company decided not to miss the intended release date for the game despite possible problems but has since adopted a different stance. Colossal just announced that the DLC will be delayed while the company works on fixing the game's performance troubles.




In a long developer note, Colossal Order informs of the company's main goals moving forward. In summation, those are:


Performance improvements - which will focus on getting better GPU performance. The current version of the game infamously features too much detail, and fans have criticized it for rendering stuff as useless as teeth that you never see. The teeth are, reportedly, not the issue, but the team is aware that the performance needs improving.


Bug fixes - the developers are working hard on over 100 instances of reproducible bugs reported by the community.


Editor and Mod support - the developers are working on improving the map editor as well as its interface before they do a proper release.


Cities Skylines 2 post-launch roadmap


The company doesn't have a release date for the upcoming content but has presented a broad window.

The Asset pack has been delayed to Q1 2024 (from Q4 2023)


The Creator packs have been delayed to Q2 2024 (from Q1 2024)


The expansion is still set to release during Q2 2024

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CD Projekt Red released Phantom Liberty, the first and last expansion for its 2020 RPG, Cyberpunk 2077, in September. We loved it – find out why in Game Informer's Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty review here – and if you enjoyed the base game, it's not an expansion to miss. Currently, it's only available for purchase as an add-on to Cyberpunk 2077, but if you haven't yet picked it up, it might be worth waiting just a couple more weeks. That's because CDPR has revealed Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition, which includes the base game and the Phantom Liberty expansion in one single package.
Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on December 5, and will be released in both a digital format and physical. Check out the box art below: 
Big news… Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition arrives on December 5th in digital AND physical form for Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC!

November 21, 2023
All that CDPR has shared about this new edition is the tweet above so it remains to be seen if the Ultimate Edition includes any new goodies or enhancements. Given Phantom Liberty and the Cyberpunk 2077 2.0 update improved the game in big ways, reworking and revamping several of its mechanics in the process, it's unlikely the Ultimate Edition will include any changes in that vein. Only time will tell, though.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[GTA 6 developer Rockstar Games were once working on a zombie survival game set on a Scottish island, which sounds like a mixture of GTA: Vice City and legendary Arma mod DayZ. That's according to former technical director Obbe Vermeij, who joined Rockstar North in 1995 back when it was called DMA Design, and left in 2009 following the release of GTA 4. In the run-up to the GTA 6 trailer reveal next month, he's started blogging about the development of several Rockstar games, from GTA through grotty snuff film simulator Manhunt to cancelled projects such as the zombie title and Cold War stealth fest Agent.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nvidia’s RTX 4060 Ti is likely one of the hotter properties this Black Friday week; its dual 1080p/1440p capabilities, ray tracing and DLSS 3 support, efficiency, and relatively restrained pricing make it one of the best graphics cards of the current generation. Now, there’s an all-too-rare opportunity to grab one at significantly less than RRP/MSRP, with the triple-fan MSI GeForce RTX 4060 Ti Ventus 3X OC falling to £380 in the UK and $370 in the US.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 developers Sledgehammer Games (umpteenth reminder: that's Modern Warfare 3 as in the 2023 game, not the 2011 FPS of the same name) have hosted a Reddit AMA in which they answered a bunch of questions about the evolution of the game's competitive meta. That's meta as in the overall balance of power between Modern Warfare 3 loadouts, playstyles and so forth based on a variety of factors such as map design, rather than the Alan Wake 2 kind of "meta", where characters talk about how they're just characters in a game and so on. I would dearly like to see some crossover between these types of "meta". I guess the Call of Duty that comes closest to fulfilling that idea is Black Ops 3, with its fourth-wall-breaking cyborg theatrics.


Anyway, the discussion is interesting because it touches on the fact that the evolution of an FPS competitive meta is an artful balance of prediction and reaction, imposing new directions on players at times, taking direction from them at others. The developers want the Modern Warfare 3 meta to change "from season to season" - the question, of course, is how to do this without alienating fans of certain weapons and strategies.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[AMD's Ryzen 5000 series was the zenith of the long-running AM4 platform, a family of CPUs that offered an extreme uptick in performance compared to Ryzen 1000 processsors on the same socket. While the exceptional 5800X3D takes the title of the fastest gaming CPU from this generation, the standard 5800X is another capable performer - and this eight-core, 16-thread CPU is significantly cheaper during Black Friday, costing just £181/$207. 
That's pretty good going for a CPU that cost double that at the start of 2022 - especially when it also costs 60% as much as the Ryzen 7 5800X3D while delivering 75% to 95% of the performance, depending on the game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yakuza: Like A Dragon was a very silly game in spite of its dramatic narrative, but its follow-up, Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth, looks to give it a run for its money. Between letting Ichiban ride a dolphin and its Animal Crossing-style city-building mode, fans of the franchise’s goofball nature should be in for a treat, and a new batch of screenshots highlight this.
The images provide looks at Ichiban, Kiryu Joryu, and their returning friends, such as Nanba, Adachi, and Saeko, kicking butt in a variety of classes and looking absurd doing so. Other familiar faces will be playable party members for the first time, such as Seonhee, who is shown brutalizing opponents with a whip in the images. It's clear that Hawaii will never be the same once these guys are done with it. 


Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on January 26. You can learn more about the game and see it in action in this pair of trailers. Be sure to also read our review of its direct predecessor, Like A Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name, here.]]></summary>

Ahead of AMD Ryzen Threadripper 7000 series processors becoming available via DIY retailers on the 21st, today marks the review/performance embargo expiration for the Threadripper 7000 series. First up today is a look at how the new Threadripper 7970X 32-core and Threadripper 7980X 64-core processors are performing for Linux HEDT workstations... Or the TLDR: the incredible Linux performance and potential for a wide-range of creator and developer workloads now possible with the Ryzen Threadripper 7000 series.]]></summary>

Yep, the same Logitech G502 Hero we post about every gosh-darn time there’s a Black Friday, or whatever mutant Prime Day variation Amazon has spawned.

Together with our hardware editor James, I'll be manning our Black Friday liveblog this week, bringing you rolling coverage of the stuff we think is worth highlighting as it happens, from great deals on new microSD cards for your Steam Deck to the best discounts on graphics cards, SSDs and more.

(And if you're looking for more console-related Black Friday deals, then our friends at Eurogamer have their own Black Friday liveblog you may want to keep an eye on as well.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mazes and labyrinths can be confusing, frustrating, oppressive, nightmarish. They are the kinds of structures videogame developers are reluctant to put in their games, because the potential for the player losing heart or patience is relatively high. But as productions, they can be strangely economical, oddly light-footed. Mazes and labyrinths, after all, twist up space and as such, discover or create additional space within space. They allow vast journeys to happen within areas that are modest when judged in terms of square footage, journeys that encompass a multitude of locations that have an inherent, automatic atmosphere: tantalising forks in the path and mocking dead ends, hubs with corridors leading in all directions, leisurely perimeter paths and gristly knots of inner passages.
As such, I think they're useful to reflect on at a time when the mantra of growth for its own sake has conquered the heart of videogame world design: bigger budgets for grander maps in terms of both explorable area and computational resource, all the way to Armageddon (did you know that Suicide Squad's Metropolis is twice the size of Arkham Knight's Gotham City?). But don't take it from me, an armchair developer with armchair socialist sensibilities. Take it from The Legend of Zelda.

Spider-Man sees the friendly neighborhood hero battle a star-studded gallery of villains in an original adventure chock full of comic book goodness. As Spider-Man's first fully 3D action-adventure game, it laid the groundwork for mechanics such as web-swinging, a variety of web shooter attacks, and wall-crawling stealth gameplay. Let's see how it holds up 23 years later. 
Starting today and every Friday at 2:30 p.m. Central on Twitch,  join Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard as they'll stream two hours of the game each week until they beat it. If you can't watch us live, new episodes will be uploaded the next Saturday morning on our Game Informer Shows YouTube channel. You'll also find archived episodes on this page as they're uploaded.

The Talos Principle II often left me staring at my screen in awe. Sometimes, from sheer intimidation in the face of a seemingly formidable puzzle. Other times,  from my incredulous pride after unraveling said problem. But most of all, the experience regularly gave me pause as I pondered a philosophical idea or argument that challenged my viewpoints on the nature of existence and humanity’s place in the cosmos. These moments spurred me to solve the game’s 100+ puzzles in search of answers, and I’m largely satisfied with what I discovered.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Well, I think this is probably the first and only time I've ever heard British documentarian Adam Curtis appear as an ominous backing sample in an RPG boss battle theme, but in many ways, I hope it's not the last. Forget the operatic choral chants of Final Fantasy bosses. The new rallying cry against peak villainy is now some no-nonsense British commentary about the state of human extinction. It works surprisingly, well, and Small Saga is a game shot through with these kinds of Britishisms, set in the parks, streets and underbelly of modern-day London. 
Only this isn't an RPG about humans, but the rodents that live beneath their feet - the mice, rats, squirrels and moles who have developed a kind of proto-medieval society of their own built from the trash and discarded objects they've scavenged from under our noses. In this world, humans are terrifying 'gods', supermarkets with their shelves of seeds and grain are called 'Heaven', and your main mode of transportation is a pigeon with a wicker basket. It's a fascinating world solo developer Darya Noghani has created here, and it would be a thrilling turn-based RPG, too - if only its battles didn't completely cheese it when it comes to providing any sense of challenge.

It makes use of a similar angled perspective, appears similarly focussed on build customisation, with hundreds of magic items to equip, and sees you playing out the backstories of various mythological personalities - derived, in this case, not from Ancient Greece but China and Buddhism.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Final Fantasy VII Rebirth arrives in February, which isn’t too far on the horizon, so Square Enix is getting players prepared with a cinematic refresher of its predecessor, Final Fantasy VII Remake. The company pairs that with a batch of fresh screenshots and art, including the first glimpse of the Highwind airship. 
The video sees Red XIII narrate the broad strokes of the 2020 adventure. While it doesn’t touch on the finer details and background of the characters, it provides a decent summary that's perhaps better served as a reminder for fans who played Remake rather than someone coming into Rebirth completely fresh. Unfortunately, the recap doesn’t touch on the events of the Intermission expansion that introduces Yuffie, who joins the party in Rebirth, so unfamiliar players will have to do their own homework on that. 


Square has released some new images, including a piece of art depicting Aerith in front of the Highwind. The screenshots show off the town of Kalm, the summon Kujata, the abandoned Mythril Mine, and a few side characters. Oh, and Chadley is there too. 

Final Fantasy VII Rebirth launches on February 29 for PlayStation 5. You can watch us play two demos of the game in this video and read our hands-on impressions here. You can also get the answers to some of Rebirth's burning questions in this interview with Square Enix.]]></summary>

Depending on a Fortnite skin, it might only be useable on a creative island with a T rating, meaning the Resident Evil Claire Redfield skin, which features a pistol in a holster on her thigh, can't be used on islands rated less than Teen. Players were upset with this change as it made skins they paid real money for (often $10 to $20 per skin) unusable in all the ways they might have previously been usable. 
Epic said only 7 percent of Fortnite skins are only usable on Teen-rated islands, at the time, but it's clear enough skins are affected to have the community unhappy with this update.
Over the weekend, Epic released a statement through the official Fortni…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Reader, I have a confession to make. I have tried long and hard to like adorable citybuilder Townscaper, but I just cannot muster much affection for it. I love how it looks, I love what it does, and I will endlessly admire how its little multi-coloured building bricks morph and shift, smooshed together in far more creative ways than I could ever manage myself. But when presented with a blank canvas and no direction on what to do with said multi-coloured building bricks, my mind seizes up and straight up refuses to extract any joy from it. It's a feeling I fear will apply to the equally charming Tiny Glade when that eventually comes out as well, based on the very lovely GIFs I've seen of it so far, and honestly, there are times when I worry my brain is just a teeny bit broken and I have lost the ability to find joy in what are clearly very joyful little creations.
But then I play games like Pile Up!, a micro citybuilder that's very much in the same vein as Townscaper, and realise, oh no, I do just need some objectives and structure to my game playing for everything to be fine again.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Former Dragon Age: Dreadwolf production director and veteran Mass Effect scribe Mac Walters has founded a new studio, Worlds Untold, with funding from NetEase. According to the official site, the studio will develop "triple-A action adventure games with an emphasis on narrative and worldbuilding": its first project is a single-player-focussed, "near future action adventure game in a breathtaking world filled with mystery and exploration". 


Amongst other things, this reflects Walter's desire to move away from the "space opera" RPGs he's made in the past and develop a more linear, story-driven sci-fi game, whose universe might also host TV or novel adaptations. Which might not sound very appealing to BioWare diehards, but you can rest easy on one count: the game will have plenty of lore, though how it's served up to the player is another question.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In terms of straight-up savings, the best Black Friday gaming laptop deals are surely the most generous among pre-Christmas games tech discounts. True, they’re pricier than any gaming mouse or Steam Deck accessory to begin with, but basic principles of proportions mean that the choicest deals will lop off enormous wads of cash.
And these are quality lappies, too. Some of my personal favourites (the Gigabyte Aorus 15X! The Razer Blade 14! The Acer Nitro 5, if you’re on a budget!) have made it into this season's Black Friday deal highlights, and there are plenty more besides. Most of them are rocking up-to-date Nvidia GeForce RTX 40 series GPUs, too, so they’ll be able to handle ray tracing and roid their own performance via DLSS 3. To varying extents, naturally.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Reports suggested Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 was a crunch-driven 16 month project, and our campaign review thought it displayed characteristics of a rushed schedule-filler. Besides quality gunplay and a fantastic array of classic maps, MW3's multiplayer doesn't do much to differentiate itself from MW2, aside from being more of a frustrating grind. And its awkwardly positioned zombies mode, though it might appeal to some, has been robbed of its sickle-sharpening soul. All of it does smack of being rushed, and I'd only recommend the game if you're an ardent fan of COD who's happy to accept little in the way of changes. Otherwise, this FPS simply isn't worth spending your hard-earned bucks on.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At the time of Star Fleet II: Krellan Commander's release, I was still learning to spell and wrestling with the whole "going to the toilet independently" business, but if I'd had access to an MS-DOS PC between potty-training sessions, I dare say I'd have tried my hand at being an intergalactic warlord. Originally published in 1989 by Interstel Corporation and distributed by a little-known company called Electronic Arts, it's an absurdly in-depth and fiddly-looking space sim in which you fly around a randomly generated cosmos in your horrible Klingon-adjacent battlecruiser, blowing up or commandeering other ships, bombarding or invading planets, and generally speaking being a nuisance. 


According to its creators, Trevor Sorensen and Mark Baldwin, the game had a rushed launch that led to a lot of technical issues. The developers released another, relatively bug-free version in 1991, which is the version you'll find on most retro game preservation sites. Then, in 2018, Sorensen decided to make a new 2.0 version of Krellan Commander using his original 486 PC, which finally launched this week on Steam and GOG.

Back in the '90s, Nintendo played faster and looser with its library of characters. Sometimes Yoshi showed up in The Legend of Zelda, and Kirby was whatever color he felt like at the moment, be it gray or pink. In 1996, that laissez-faire attitude was in full effect for the release of Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars for the Super Nintendo. Link, Samus, and even Donkey Kong (sort of) all had inexplicable cameos in the game, and one of my big questions about the remake was whether or not those would move forward.

Arguably the most interesting secret boss of the original game was Culex. He is not a Final Fantasy character, but he looks and feels like one and features Final Fantasy music and sound effects.
Culex appears in Super Mario RPG remake as he did in the original game, which is to say he is a pixelated, 2D creature. He also features the original throwback soundtrack and sound effects. You access him the same way, too – by buying fireworks and trading them with the little girl nearby in Moletown for a shiny stone. You then use that shiny stone in Monstro Town on the locked door.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Steam Deck OLED releases today, providing a new avenue for game players (especially those with big Steam libraries) to take their gaming experience on the go. The new OLED models (one at 512 GB and another at 1TB storage) effectively replace the original release as the new Steam Deck flagship hardware. The older 64 GB and 512 GB LCD models are being phased out, while the 256 GB LCD will remain available at a reduced price.
Steam Deck OLED is not a fundamentally new platform. In many ways that matter, our review of the original still stands, and snagging one of the older LCD screen models is now an even more substantial value at the lower price. However, several of the concerns that surfaced in that review have been remedied by the new model – enough that a new evaluation is warranted.

Kaiserpunk is the first time I've seen a grand strategy game that lets you hop down instead to a citybuilding layer, where the construction of alternate history early-20th century industrial towns will determine whether you have the economic power to win the war.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this month, we launched a documentary called "Violence Is Inevitable: The Making of Humanity." And then, in a bit of a meta twist, we hung out with Humanity co-developer and publisher Enhance and discussed how we made our making-of documentary. Even cooler, we made a Game Informer level within Humanity – and you can play it now.
All this happened on the "HUMANITY Hub Community Stream," where myself (Blake) and Alex Van Aken discussed why we decided to make a documentary on Humanity, how we crafted the video, and even cutting-room floor content that didn't make the final product. We closed the show by putting our collective brains together to make a level based on the GI logo.
You can check out an archived version of the stream below:


By no means is our Humanity level an official partnership between Enhance and GI, but it's certainly a fun way to end a project that was a months-long labor of love. To play for yourself, either search via the name "GAME INFORMER FUN!" in the game's User Stages options or the stage ID: 013-020-5453.

Unlike with the original Steam Deck’s launch, Valve say the much-upgraded OLED version arrives with ample stock, so buyers can hopefully get theirs posted out without delay. The familiar reservation system is "ready to switch on", though, should demand overwhelm supply.

"But it works out cheaper!" I’d plead, sobbing, into disinterested ears. So be it – at least with the Black Friday sales going on, a prebuilt rig can be much better value that it would otherwise. The PCs on this list, some of which have several hundred pounds/dollars off their usual prices, are testament to that.

It’s all proven just too dangerous for Alan Wake 2 devs Remedy Entertainment, who’ve rebooted their upcoming F2P shooter Vanguard as a more traditional paid game. We later return to our core competences, in press release-speak, to talk about the Steam Deck OLED and the games we’ve been playing this week.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The ocean planet of GUP-14 is not a happy place. Its seabed has been gunked up with piles of trash, globs of purple gunge and nasty clouds of micro-plastics, all because an industrial megacorp couldn't be bothered to clean up after themselves after bleeding it for resources. That megacorp's since upped sticks to, sadly, continue their terrible ways somewhere else in the solar system, but calling out these bad practices (beyond them being obviously bad and not good for the planet) is not really Loddlenaut's concern here. 
Rather, your job is to simply clean up this mess with your array of high-tech gadgetry, healing its polluted environments so: a) it's not a grim, purple hellscape anymore; b) native, axolotl-like loddle creatures can move back in and prosper. It's simple, satisfying work that's designed to make you feel warm and fuzzy inside without having to think too hard. But its straightforward, frictionless tale may leave some wishing it had just a little more bite, and less of a sense that you're laying the ground for some other faceless corpo power to go and splurge all over it again.

In South Korea, where pirate movies and careless clicks turn innocent teenagers into crazed gambling addicts, anti-piracy messaging may have hit the jackpot.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today marks the release of the PlayStation Portal, Sony’s $200 remote player specifically built to accommodate players looking to enjoy their existing PS5 console and its library of games at home but while away from your main gaming display.
By any measure, the PlayStation Portal is a very targeted and specific-use product, and it’s worth clarifying out of the gate: This is not a standalone console in any way. Rather, the Portal allows you to connect to a PS5 you already have in your home over your Wi-Fi network (or any Wi-Fi network) and play the games you have downloaded on that PS5 from other places around your home. You can also connect the Portal to other Wi-Fi networks outside of your home, though our testing found inconsistent results when doing so. Regardless of where you connect f…]]></summary>

Speaking to me during a showing of Ara - which is notable among turn-based 4X games for playing out every player's turn simultaneously - the creators offered a rousing characterisation of the genre, suggesting that strategy games have somewhat shucked off their association with stifling complexity and elitism, thanks not least to the recent influence of board gaming.

Lacking graphics options, suffering from visual limitations and crashes, and generally barebones as a package, the catalogue of the first three Metal Gear Solid titles and their two Metal Gear prequels hasn’t exactly gone down well with players.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Naheulbeuk’s Dungeon Master is a staff management game disguised as a dungeon management game. At the start of each week, your minions might choose to go on strike, demanding everything from more cells in the prison to fewer dwarves in the workplace. If that second example elicited a startled little “yikes”, then good, you’re paying attention. Your minions are also occasional racists – which at least makes some of the more brutal options at hand for dealing with striking workers more palatable.


You can sacrifice the entire picket line to your in-house demon lord, or terminate their employment without tribunal. You can also lock them up in those prisons they repeatedly claim are so lacking in cells. Or you can agree to their terms to expand the canteen and sack all of their shortest colleagues. But no matter which option you choose, minion strikes are inconsequential, only ever amounting to a comedy aside. Just as the turn-based Dungeon Of Naheulbeuk set out to skewer D&D, Naheulbeuk’s Dungeon Master is a brave and self-aware parody of dungeon management games. But it's far too barebones to invest in seriously.

Following in the wake of Microsoft, Epic, CD Projekt, Sony and, well, take your pick, the company aim to cut roughly 30% of their workforce to shore up profits. The specific reasoning here is that Digital Bros think that people aren't interested in playing original new games; they'd rather get to grips with fictions and franchises they know and love already. As such, the company plan to "limit" their big budget projects in future, though no specific cancellations have been announced.

Behind Marvel's Spider-Man 2 on October 2023's best-selling list is Super Mario Bros. Wonder, the latest Switch exclusive from Nintendo at-the-time, and Assassin's Creed Mirage, the shorter throwback title from Ubisoft starring Assassin's Creed Valhalla's Basim.

The original Super Mario RPG, released for Super Nintendo in 1996, felt like it was meant to be your first RPG. In an era when Final Fantasy tried its best to tell mature stories within the medium's limitations and Dragon Quest demanded hours and hours of your time, Mario’s adventure felt much brighter and more manageable. Familiar characters, a lighthearted story, a reasonable length, and timed button-pressing during combat made it stand out against the competition.

Shantae Advance: Risky Revolution was arguably the most interesting title. Developer WayForward began development on the game 20 years ago, but never completed it. Next year, the game will finally make its way to Switch, but retain the Game Boy Advance aesthetic it was always meant to have.

Persona 5 has become its own sort of mini-franchise within the Persona series. With many spin-off titles released over the years, such as Persona 5 Strikers, Persona 5: Dancing in Starlight, and Persona Q2: New Cinema Labyrinth, Atlus seems to love using Persona 5’s popularity to explore new stories and gameplay ideas. However, I applaud Atlus for making all of these spin-offs in completely different genres from each other. The latest, Persona 5 Tactica, delivers an entertaining story, a colorful cast of charact…]]></summary>

Mustakro on Twitter has taken their enjoyment of the game's boss designs and turned some of Lies of P's toughest challenges into Cuphead-style bosses, and it rules. 


I came across Mustakro this morning, scrolling through my Twitter feed, when I saw a really awesome rendition of Lies of P's King of Puppets boss (one of the most difficult in the game) in the style of Rubberhose, which is that classic animation style popularized in the 1920s seen in Cuphead.

Then I clicked through some of Mustakro's other tweets to find even more Lies of P bosses in the style of Cuphead, and I love these renditions so much that I just wanted to share. So, enjoy their other art below:

Call of Duty cycles through its lineup of villains on a yearly basis. Sometimes it's Nazis, other times it's Russian nationalists or zombies. But the most dangerous threat is one without a lust for brains or access to weapons of war; it's stagnation. And while many Call of Duty teams often switch up just enough variables to stave off monotony, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III fully submits to the annual churn.


Speeding ahead also impedes the storytelling since it barrels through beats at …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After months of character reveals, Tekken 8 has announced the final fighter of its launch roster: Reina. This brand-new character sports a lightning-quick moveset, earning her the nickname “Purple Lightning," and has mysterious ties to the Mishima clan.
Bandai Namco states that little is known about Reina's history besides she’s a student of the Mishima Polytechnical School. For some reason, she really wants to fight Jin (move over, Hwoarang), and based on her gameplay trailer, she seems more than capable of taking him on. Check Reina out in action below. 


With Reina’s addition, the 32-fighter roster is now complete. Here’s the full list of characters, with new fighters denoted and links to applicable articles/trailers:
Alisa Bosconovitch
Asuka Kazama
Azucena Milagros Ortiz Castillo (New)
Bryan Fury
Claudio Serafino
Devil Jin

Jack-8 (New)
Jin Kazma
Jun Kazama

Additionally, the game's first Season of post-launch DLC will add four unannounced fighters. These characters will be released separately each season throughout 2024, with the first arriving sometime in the spring. 
Tekken 8 launches on January 26 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. Check our early hands-on impressions of the game here.]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-11-13T18:37:59.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Amazon is laying off 180 jobs in its games division, hopping on the tragically overcrowded bandwagon of layoffs in the game industry this year. The news comes via Aftermath, which reports that the layoffs are focused in two areas – the Crown Twitch channel, which will reportedly be eliminated altogether, and the game growth teams. Employees were notified of the changes through an email from Christoph Hartman, VP of Amazon Games. This is the second wave of layoffs this division of the company has faced this year.
An excerpt of the announcement email can be read below:
There have been so many layoffs in the gaming industry this year that it's getting hard to keep track of. Last week, we learned Free Radical Design is on the verge of closing down and that Ubisoft laid off more than 100 employees. The week before that, roughly 100 employees were laid off at Destiny 2 developer Bungie. 
In January, Microsoft laid off 10,000 employees amidst its ongoing $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard, which it completed last month. 
In August, Striking Distance Studios, the team behind last year's The Callisto Protocol, laid off more than 30 employees, and that same month, Mass Effect and Dragon Age developer BioWare laid off 50 employees, including long-time studio veterans. The following month, in September, Immortals of Aveum developer Ascendant Studios laid off roughly 45% of its staff. 
Just last month, The Last of Us developer Naughty Dog laid off at least 25 employees, and Telltale Games underwent layoffs as well, although an actual number of laid-off employees has not yet been revealed. And in late October, Dreams developer Media Molecule laid off 20 employees.
The hearts of Game Informer's staff are with the people laid off from Amazon Games, along with everyone else who has lost a job this year.

While the throwback 3D platforming adventure looked great in its own right, what caught a lot of people's attention was the team behind it. Evening Star's creative director and lead engine architect is Christian Whitehead, one of the lead developers behind 2017's Sonic Mania. Whitehead isn't alone, though, as various other Evening Star developers also worked on Sonic Mania. While we've still got some time before the game's release – it's due out sometime in 2024 – Game Informer has a special sneak peek at its music and can exclusively reveal three tracks from the game.

As with every Indie World Showcase, the question must be asked: is this the time where we finally see Hollow Knight: Silksong, the Hollow Knight sequel from developer Team Cherry that began life as a DLC to the original game? It probably won't be but it's always fun to get your hopes up a little bit so that they may be gently crushed. 
Tomorrow's Indie World Showcase for Nintendo Switch begins at Noon ET. 
In the meantime, read Game Informer's Hollow Knight review and then check out everything announced during the last Indie World Showcase, which was held in April, for a glance at what to potentially expect with tomorrow's.

In the wake of the expansion announcement and seasonal reveals that rolled out about Diablo IV, we had the chance to speak with Diablo franchise manager Rod Fergusson and game director Joe Shely. We asked about the studio’s development processes post-launch, the specifics of gathering and responding to fan feedback and criticism, and the most critical priorities for Diablo IV in the months following launch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Put your sleuthing caps on, detectives—it’s time to solve some mysteries! We are proud to announce that a whole batch of HeR Interactive’s Nancy Drew games are now ready for public testing:
In Nancy Drew: Stay Tuned for Danger, a soap opera star needs your help in uncovering who is behind a series of death threats that sound a little too real for comfort. 
Nancy Drew: Message in a Haunted Mansion has you helping out with repairs in a Victorian mansion. However, a series of strange accidents, plus some murmurings of a ghost haunting, quickly threaten to turn this renovation into an investigation.
In Nancy Drew: Treasure in the Royal Tower a failed ski vacation at an eccentric castle with even more eccentric inhabitants soon turns into a quest to uncover a lost piece of the history of the French Revolution.
And if you’re looking for something more thrilling, in Nancy Drew: The Final Scene, you will find yourself racing against the clock to find your kidnapped friend, while also saving a historical theater with more than a fair share of secrets from demolition.
The games are available for purchase through HeR Interactive’s website or Steam (Stay Tuned for Danger is not available on Steam, however). Or if you already own a CD copy of the games, their English and Russian variants will also work. To play them with ScummVM, you will need a daily development build. As always, if you encounter any issues, please submit a bug report to our issue tracker.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you've seen Netflix's Arcane League of Legends animated series, there's a high probability you really like it – the show's great, even for non-League of Legends fans. It tells the heartwrenching story of sisters Vi and Jinx and their struggle to come to terms with each other in the high-tech (and magical) utopian city of Piltover and its seedy underbelly known as Zaun. The first season hit the subscription streaming service in November of 2021and now we know that Arcane Season 2 hits Netflix this time next year. 
More specifically, Arcane Season 2 drops on Netflix in November of 2024. To coincide with the news, Netflix has released a short teaser featuring Jinx. Check it out below:

With roughly a year to go before Season 2, if you haven't yet watched Arcane, which features voice actors like Hailee Steinfeld, Yuri Lowenthal, Ella Purnell, and more, you've got plenty of time to do so – and it's well worth your time!
In the meantime, check out the League of Legends Jinx champion skin that was added to Fortnite to celebrate Arcane, and then read Game Informer's review of Ruined King: A League of Legends story. Read about Convergence: A League of Legends Story after that.

Braid was first released for Xbox 360's Live Arcade on August 6, 2008, and stars Tim, a boy searching for a princess captured by a monster. The 2D platformer centers on time manipulation mechanics that players utilize to solve puzzles and locate/assemble jigsaw pieces.

For context, Marvel's Spider-Man 2 outsold Super Mario Bros. Wonder, which is the fastest-selling Super Mario game after selling through 4.3 million copies in two weeks. Marvel's Spider-Man 2 was named the fastest-selling PlayStation Studios game just three days after its release, too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this summer, amid an incoming typhoon, Game Informer visited the Bandai Hobby Center Shinkan, the 132,000-square-foot factory where the entertainment company manufactures its iconic Gundam model kits. If you purchase a new Gundam model kit at your local store today, it originated in this facility in Shizuoka, Japan. The factory contains 35 plastic color-molding machines – 25 electric and 10 hydraulic – all helping produce millions of models yearly.
Bandai Spirits employee Miyuki Nakagiri, the subject matter expert on how exactly the factory operates, escorts us through the building. Our translator during this tour is Atsuo Yoshimura, a video game production manager who’s worked at Bandai Namco for the last 17 years. Notably, Yoshimura worked on last year’s Elden Ring – Game Informer’s 2022 Game of the Year, and most recently, Armored Core VI Fires of Rubicon. Additionally, Yoshimura was instrumental in helping to coordinate Game Informer’s recent Armored Core VI cover story trip.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are very pleased to announce today the start of the testing period of two single-game engines: Kingdom: The Far Reaches and Escape From Hell!
Kingdom, was developed and released by Interplay in 1995. Only the DOS version of the game (available on gog.com) is supported. It's a cartoon FMV game, with an inventory, in which you have to guide Lathan Kandor through a medieval world, discovering the magic spells and the items required to defeat an evil wizard. 
Escape From Hell, was developed for Electronic Arts by the game veterans Richard Seaborne and Alan Murphy and was released in 1990. You play Alan in this keyboard-only Role Playing Game and visit Hell, looking for your girlfriend who was accidentally teleported there.
Both games use heavily hardcoded logic which is error prone and requires a lot of testing, so we need your feedback more than ever as they are both incompletely tested. There is sadly only one known demo for Kingdom. Support for the Windows and Mac versions of Kingdom may come later! Please contact us if you have some other demos of both games.
To play any of these games, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker and please take some screenshots along the way!
