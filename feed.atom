For the month before the 3DS and Wii U eShops close for new purchases on 27th March, each day we're going to highlight a specific eShop game for one of those consoles and give a short pitch as to why we think it deserves your love and attention — before it's too late. The chance to add these to your library will be gone for good soon and, for one reason or another, these eShop-exclusives are close to our hearts.

Hey Yo, friends and well-wishers, and thanks for showing out for Whatcha Been Playing? I hope that this week has been a fine one, and that the weekend will be equally filled with mirth and merriment. I've found that my weekends have been speeding by far too quickly. One moment I'm buying my Saturday donut, and the next I'm grumbling out of bed on Monday morning. I think the key to prolonging the weekend is to do as much as possible as soon as possible. Less social media checking, less 20-minute showers, and less time trying to unlock Juri in Street Fighter: Duel.
So, this Saturday, I am NOT GOING TO STOP. I'm going to be showered, dressed, and made-up in minutes, out buying my donut, and then back home in double quick time — where I will watch movies, chat with friends, che…]]></summary>

Nintendo Switch fans could be in for a treat in the near future with an official social media account for the Gothic series seemingly teasing a release of the original fantasy-themed action RPG on the hybrid platform.
Gothic was developed by the German-based studio Piranha Bytes (also known for the action RPG Risen) and released on PC in 2001. This seems to be the second Switch teaser, following a post at the end of last year that teased Gothic II running on Switch.

The 3DS and Wii U eShop services are shutting down at the end of this month and that means you've only got so much time left to buy all of the digital games you possibly can on Nintendo's older storefronts. YouTuber, streamer and video game media personality Jirard "The Completionist" Khalil has taken this to the next level by quite literally purchasing every game available on these platforms.
The main driving force behind this idea was video game preservation – with the aim to "save" every 3DS and Wii U eShop title before they are lost forever. The mission was successful but it's come at a price, with the total amount of purchases adding up to $22,791 USD.

The DLC for Mario Kart 8 Deluxe really hits its stride with Wave 3, dropping the best courses we’d seen in the Booster Course Pass. From the brilliantly simple reinvention of Boo Lake to the charming Christmas-themed jaunt that is Merry Mountain, it was going to be tough to surpass what Nintendo brought players in that wave.
Depending on who you ask, Booster Course Wave 4 might actually be the best set of tracks yet.

Flash forward nearly 16 years later, and most of the enduring, popular new intellectual properties since then haven't come AAA at all, and instead hail from what you might call "B budget" developers. Human Fall Flat, Five Nights at Freddy's, Genshin Impact, Among Us, Fall Guys, Fortnite, Vampire Survivors, and Rocket League are just a few of the non-AAA games that went on to find big, sustained audiences since then.

Nintendo's system has quite literally thousands of titles to enjoy, many of them absolutely free to download and play, and many of the others with free demos available on the Switch eShop, so you can try before you buy.
Below we've collected together some of the best demos on the eShop. It's a genre-spanning, motley mixture of AAA releases, indie gems, undeniably brilliant titles and others that may be more of an acquired taste — and therefore perfect fodder for a gameplay demo to see if you like what's on the menu before placing your order.

This week's Arcade Archives entry is another Namco oddity, as Hamster has prepped and readied little-seen sequel 3D Thunder Ceptor II, now available to download on PS4 and Nintendo Switch.
Released in 1986 as a pseudo-sequel to the original Thunder Ceptor, (which only launched earlier that same year), 3D Thunder Ceptor II ii an into-the-screen shmup/rail shooter, which sees the player pilot the titular vessel is fast-blasting sci-fi action. Devised as Namco's answer to Sega's hugely successful Space Harrier, Thunder Ceptor II features similar gameplay, (though nowhere near as fast), although it does include a rudimentary HUD, offering up information such as weapon selection and enemy position.
Check out the action in the video below, courtesy of YouTuber Replay Burners.

In the arcades, 3D Thunder Ceptor II turned heads due to its groundbreaking use of stereoscopic 3D. The cabinet itself utilized a variety of layered windows in order to create false depth, making the enemies seemingly leap off the screen and toward the player. While the game itself wasn't widespread, its utilization of 3D technology was praised, with other developers following with their own 3D titles in the following years, including Namco's own Starblade. Of course, it goes without saying that the Arcade Archives release does not include 3D support, kind of removing a key element of game's concept.
3D Thunder Ceptor II is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at around $8.

Destiny 2 players are gathering in the game's central hub, the Tower, to pay their respects to Lance Reddick.

If you head to the Tower yourself, players can still be seen by Commander Zavala, paying tribute to Reddick's work. Members of the community, as well as Bungie staff members, have also been sharing their tributes to the actor online.

Last year, NIS America made a Legend of Heroes fan out of me with the release of Trails from Zero, the first part of the Crossbell Arc of the greater Trails storyline. I found it to be a fascinating RPG with an outstanding narrative and gameplay structure that positioned the title as some sort of "playable police procedural". While overly talkative (and a bit ugly on the PS4), Trails from Zero ended up as one of my favorite games from last year.
Chances are I’ll be saying the same thing about Trails to Azure when we finally get through 2023.

Shovel Knight Dig is striking the earth once again. Nitrome and Yacht Club Games have announced a free DLC update for Shovel Knight Dig dubbed "Fate and Fortune," out now for PC and Apple Arcade, arriving later on console.
The Fame and Fortune DLC brings Black Knight into the fray. The shadowy dark knight teams up with Shovel Knight to help uncover the true Knightmare, unlocking Knightmare Mode once players have completed the base game.
This mode is a special challenge, where each stage will introduce new challenges. Enemies could hit harder, resources may become scarce, or the stage may even get longer. Each one stacks too, so expect some exponential escalation of difficulty.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PL9-Rorp3k
It's not all doom and gloom, though. A new pal Fetcher is also here, who will be waiting at the end of each stage. For a price, he'll give you a chance to exit the well mid-run, saving your gold and returning the Knight to the Hub.
Plus, there are some Mementos awarded to players for their accomplishments, with which they can decorate the Hub. Add in a new Compendium, new music track, and some quality-of-life adjustments, and it's a pretty solid update. Additionally, the crew notes on the announcement page that more free DLC is planned for Shovel Knight Dig.
Heading down the well
Shovel Knight Dig was one of several Shovel Knight spin-offs to arrive over the last few years. And with both Dig and Pocket Dungeon, it's been interesting to see Yacht Club Games let others take a stab at the franchise and see what results come up.
While Yacht Club works away at Mina the Hollower, this new Dig update seems like a good way for eager spelunkers to dive back into the world of Dig. The update is out now on PC and mobile, and will arrive at a later date for consoles. And if you're eager to pick it up now, it's on sale on Steam right now for 40% off.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here's a neat trick: if you want a high-end gaming laptop but don't want to pay over the odds for it, consider the Corsair Voyager A1600. If you buy it from Corsair's US web store, add a PC case like this one and then use code NEWBUILD, you can pick up the laptop and the case for significantly less than the cost of the laptop alone. 
In fact, this $1800 laptop that debuted in December last year for $2300, complete with Ryzen 9 CPU, 32GB of DDR5 RAM, 2TB of NVMe storage, a 16-in 2560x1600 (16:10) 240Hz display and Radeon RX 6800M graphics card, goes down to just $1536. And you get a free case, essentially, which you can resell later if you don't need it. Or keep it and build a PC in it, because these Corsair cases are actually really lovely!

Right now this Elite 2x16GB kit is available for £70, more than £30 less than its usual price.

Playtonic Friends has announced that they’ll be publishing Canteen’s work-simulator CorpoNation: The Sorting Process. Beyond the fact that it will be coming to PC via Steam, no release window has been given.
CorpoNation: The Sorting Process casts you in the role of a new employee of Ringo CorpoNation, where you must sort their genetic samples. It’s being billed as a “linear dystopian narrative,” and features tactile desk-based gameplay. Despite being a linear narrative, you’re able to customize your room and unwind after work to make your existence feel less meaningless and empty. You can also chat with your co-workers about the latest conspiracies. Check out more in this appropriately creepy trailer.
https://youtu.be/_PLdIVrJNV4
This is probably one of my favorite genres to spring up in the last decade. Following the way-too-depressing-for-me hit, Paper’s Please, smaller developers seem to have caught on that there is a lot of satisfaction when it comes to desktop busywork. The fact that you can enjoy the satisfaction of a job well done, and be rewarded with tangible progression, and not have to spend 40 hours a week doing it is enough to strip out all the soul-sucking parts and leave pure bliss.
On the other hand, CorpoNation: The Sorting Process looks like it’s going to be a small project. Its linear narrative and overt themes leave little room to really get transcendental, but that doesn’t mean it’s not going to be a fun and interesting experience. Not every game has to rewrite the playbook to be worthwhile.
CorpoNation is “coming soon” for PC.

WWE 2K23 doesn’t break the mold from last year’s big re-debut, instead offering smaller improvements and additions to the elements that worked.The action feels similar but a little more polished, the modes have more features, and is a more solid package all around. Though there are still some kinks to work out, 2K23 stands as a respectable follow-up. 
Control-wise, 2K23 is identical to the previous game’s revamped setup, but is a bit smoother. Legacy issues remain, however, such as how finicky picking up weap…]]></summary>

Lance Reddick, the actor who garnered much acclaim for his roles in The Wire and John Wick as well as his work in games, has died at age 60.
TMZ reported the news earlier today, with its sources saying it appears to be of natural causes. Reddick's representative at Portrait PR confirmed the news to Deadline, declining to offer further details.
Reddick studied music at the University of Rochester's Eastman School of Music, and earned a Master of Fine Arts from the Yale School of Drama. He first started acting in 1996, taking on a number of TV roles and series appearances, as well as hitting the big screen in films like Great Expectations.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's also on sale for the Spring Sale
Valve is celebrating one whole year since the launch of its portable gaming device, the Steam Deck. Part of that is an update that makes an already-popular modding practice official: Steam Deck startup movies.
When you boot the Steam Deck, it plays a fun little movie, as most consoles and game devices do. Deck tinkerers quickly discovered, though, that you could go into the files of the Steam Deck and alter what played for the start-up.
Originally, Valve acknowledged this with a little Beta update, expanding the possible maximum length of boot videos from 10 to 30 seconds. But in a new update, Valve is making that functionality official.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELtzcpb_j38
The Steam Deck manufacturer is also putting up some startup movie options of its own. You can find the new items in the Points Shop over here. There's everything from a Turret Factory to papercraft and a flashing, form-changing one that feels reminiscent of Everything Everywhere All At Once.
All hands on Deck
Additionally, as part of the birthday festivities, the Steam Deck is currently 10% off. This sale will last through the duration of the currently ongoing Steam Spring Sale, up until March 23 at 10 a.m. PT. And even if you have one right now, the Sale is a good chance to get a bundle of Verified games for your Deck.
It's been a heck of a launch year for the Steam Deck. Where other Valve devices like the Steam Machine struggled in the past, the Steam Deck seems to have really found its footing in the general gaming hardware space. I know I use mine pretty often, and it's been a lifesaver when travelling. Here's to another year of Steam Deck.

Publisher Playtonic Friends has today revealed a new trailer for its upcoming neon-drenched roguelike, Elsie, and it is looking set to be a pretty one — 'pretty' in its visuals, and 'pretty challenging' in its gameplay.
Developed by Knight Shift Games, Elsie will see you taking on the role of the titular character in an attempt to save your world from the disasters that have long befallen it. To do so, you will have to make your way through a series of environments each packed to the brim with dangerous hoards of enemy robots dispatching each of them with your arsenal of explosive weapons (so far, so roguelike).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lance Reddick, perhaps best known for his role in HBO's "The Wire" has died. He was 60 years old. 
At the time of this writing, the cause of death is unknown but according to TMZ, "law enforcement sources say it appears to be natural." Deadline was also able to confirm, through the actor's public relations representative, that Reddick has died.
Beyond "The Wire," Reddick also had roles in other shows like "Fringe," "Lost," "Bosch," and even last year's "Resident Evil" series on Netflix. His movie credits include the "John Wick" franchise (he was promoting the latest, "John Wick 4," which hits theaters soon, just this week), "Godzilla Vs. Kong," and more. 
On the video game side of things, you might recognize him as the voice actor behind Destiny 2's Zavala. He also provided his voice and likeness to Sylens in PlayStation's Horizon series and Martin Hatch in Remedy's Quantum Break.

The staff at Game Informer extends their condolences to Reddick's family.]]></summary>

Splash Damage, the British developer behind the multiplayer modes for many hit titles, has announced that it has begun development on a brand new "AAA" title, currently codenamed "Project Astrid".
The studio, which is also currently beavering away on online actioner Transformers: Reactivate, were tight-lipped on details pertaining to the new project, although it did reveal that Project Astrid will be an "open world survival game" and is being developed in collaboration with popular streamers Mike "Shroud" Grzesiek and Chris "Sacriel" Ball. A teaser trailer was released specifically focusing on the latter announcement.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4rdpLGSR2c&ab_channel=SplashDamage
"This project means everything to me," said Grzesiek. "Chris and I have refined a vision for what's next in the survival genre and with Splash Damage we're setting out to build it. We want to build the best survival game ever, and with Sacriel's brain and Splash Damage's team, I know we can do it."
"Project Astrid is the culmination of this passion, born out of a partnership with two close friends, who also happen to be incredibly well-respected experts in our industry," added Splash Damage CEO Richard Jolly. "We're excited to share something fresh with our fans, as we take a bold step forward and craft a game that's truly different from anything we've done before."
Splash Damage has previously worked on the multiplayer modes for various major league franchises, including Batman: Arkham, Wolfenstein, Gears of War, and Halo. With Project Astrid, the studio could see itself landing its biggest and most pointed homegrown title to date, striding further away from its previous "Studio for Hire" roles and into the wider community of developers at large.
You can sign up for more details over on the official Splash Damage website.

You might have seen by now, but the reviews for Capcom's Resident Evil 4 remake have been published, signaling yet another modern survival horror classic that can stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the original.
Our own pals over at Push Square and Pure Xbox gave the remake a score of 10/10 each, with the former stating that it is "just as much of a masterpiece today as it was in 2005", and the latter claiming that "you can feel the care and attention to detail in every aspect of how Capcom has handled this remake". Sounds pretty good, then!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Between The Last of Us, The Mandalorian, and a viral TikTok audio, Pedro Pascal has been on a roll this month. Now, he's branching out into something he's never done before: mobile game ads. Following in the footsteps of actress Kathy Bates, Pascal has recently appeared in a series of promotional shorts for a mobile game called Merge Mansion, and Game Informer can exclusively reveal the latest installment. Check it out below:


In this series, Pascal plays a detective named Tim Rockford, who's trying to figure out what exactly is going on with the mysterious grandma in Merge Mansion. It's an enigma so elusive that he never even says exactly what he is he's investigating, though from the collection of knives he has in his evidence room, it seems an act of violence was committed.
In a press release, Pascal had the following to say about this role.
What exactly is Tim Rockford investigating? What is grandma putting in her pies? Will Pedro Pascal become a playable character in-game? You'll have to play Merge Mansion, available on iOS and Android devices, to find out.
Which extremely high-profile actor do you think will appear in a Merge Mansion ad next? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Flee from 8-bit Colin Farrell
The Oscars celebration may be over, but The Banshees of Inisherin live on in video game form. Over on this site, you can play Banshees: The Game, a pixel-y game based on the Academy Award-nominated film.
Created by Cogs & Marvel, this little retro-style game does indeed take after The Banshees of Inisherin. It's got some lovely pixel work, including great illustrations of Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson.
How exactly does it play? Well, it's basically Pac-Man. And that leads me to my first big point: for full disclosure, I have not seen this film. I'm only vaguely aware of The Banshees of Inisherin, mostly in that it stars Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson, is a bit of a dark comedy, and is set on a fictional Irish isle. It's also, as I've learned in the course of writing this article, from the same star pairing and director (Martin McDonagh) that created In Bruges, which has certainly piqued my interest.
That unfamiliarity did not help when I found that this video game is essentially Pac-Man, but with Brendan Gleeson's character steadily picking up fingers before heading to the pub. Certainly a far cry from little dots and cherries.
[caption id="attachment_369326" align="alignnone" width="640"] Screenshot by Destructoid[/caption]
Yeah, I've got no clue. Now, at this juncture, I must assume that The Banshees of Inisherin is about Brendan Gleeson desperately trying to reclaim the fingers he needs to hold his pint at the pub, before Colin Farrell catches up to him.
As deeply relatable as that sentiment is, I'm sure folks who have actually seen and enjoyed this award-nominated film find some dark humor in this set-up. It's certainly made me curious what it's all about. And really, a Pac-Man clone where you pick up fingers isn't even close to scraping the depths of movie-to-game adaptations. You can play Banshees: The Game yourself here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Strayed Lights is out next month on consoles and PC, but you can play it today via a new Steam demo. 
Developer Embers announced the news of this demo today during the Mix Direct Spring 2023 Showcase that aired today alongside a new trailer for the game. Strayed Lights continues to look great visually, and the action looks awesome. 
Check it out for yourself in the new Strayed Lights gameplay trailer below: 


"In Strayed Lights, you travel through otherworldly regions of misty woods, glowing ruins, and corrupted cities while pursued by eerie shadow creatures," a press release reads. "You also take on boss fights with colossal creatures wrought with unbridled emotion. Your tiny light will grow, picking up new abilities and increasing in size, before eventually evolving into a pseudo-mystical entity imbued with vivid powers. 
"Meanwhile, you'll get a glimpse at the mysteries of the surrounding world, whether through other strayed lights like yourself, or different creatures entirely. The game is set to an atmospheric soundtrack that reflects states of feeling in creatures you encounter, by Grammy-award-winning composer Austin Wintory – whose previous projects include Journey, Abzu, and The Banner Saga Series." 
As for the new Steam demo, Embers calls it a "limited time" experience so if you're interested in checking the game out, do it as soon as you can because there's no word on when the demo will no longer be available. 

"We are thrilled to be able to share our new gameplay trailer and demo with fans of Strayed Lights," Embers co-founder and creative director Alexandre Arramon writes in a press release. "We've been working hard to create a game that is both engaging and visually outstanding, and we can't wait for players to experience it for themselves." 
Strayed Lights hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on April 25.

One town's very like another when your head's down over your pieces, brother — And Epic Games Store users are getting set to find that out next week as Ripstone's tabletop release, Chess Ultra, will be available to download for free from Thursday, March 23.
Released in 2017, Chess Ultra takes the timeless strategy game and glosses it up for a digital recreation. Chess Ultra offers a variety of traditional and ornate chess sets and pieces, as well as 10 levels of Grandmaster A.I. and online multiplayer support. Players can choose from a variety of timed modes, or solve a litany of over 80 scenarios — some of which are pulled from the intense climaxes of real-life chess tournaments. Additionally, Chess Ultra supports 4K resolution, as well as VR through Oculus and HTC Vive.
https://youtu.be/FrONtYp6Pic
Alongside Chess Ultra, the new Epic Games Store update will also offer up free DLC for the long-running strategy title World of Warships. The World of Warships — Starter Pack: Ishizuchi features the titular Tier IV battleship, as well as 11 Epic camouflage patterns, five award containers, and a variety of in-game boosters and currency packs. The DLC usually retails for around $20, so if you're a WoW fan, be sure to jump on this bargain while you are able.
Chess Ultra and WoW: Ishizuchi will be available to download free from Epic Games Store from March 16-23. Until then, you still have time to pick up Warhammer 40,000: Gladius – Relics of War.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bow to the King
There are many great characters in the Tekken series, but few as recognizable as King. The jaguar-masked wrestler has been a staple of Tekken since the series' beginning, delivering high-flying, devastating destruction. And King is looking absolutely fantastic in the latest Tekken 8 gameplay trailer.
Bandai Namco has been gradually spotlight each Tekken 8 combatant with a gameplay trailer of their own, and King is the newest one in the arena. What more do I need to say? It's King. He's got powerful punches, leaping kicks, and chain combos with grapples that seem like they do some real, real damage. I spied a taunt of some kind as well, with King baring his chest, daring the opponent to take a swing and find out what happens. The result? Not good for them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OII3DNh4iaE
There's something electric about the way King plays that's just fun to watch. I'm normally not a grappler player, but King feels a bit more acrobatic than his throw-happy counterparts in games like Guilty Gear or Street Fighter. In the trailer, we can see the new Paul, with much less hair product than usual, getting absolutely demolished by King's knee. It's fantastic.
Whether it's talking it up on the mic or delivering devastating destruction, King always brings it. If there's one constant in Tekken, as even characters like Jin start to change and adapt for Story Purposes, I'm glad it's King.
Tekken 8 is currently in development for the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. No firm release date or window's been locked in yet.

Today, we're listing the best Kingdom Hearts spells based on their effectiveness in battle and cinematic flair on-screen. Let's hope Donald is better at healing Sora after reading this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[No slouch.
There are certain pieces of advice we wish we could go back and give our early-20s selves. We're talking practical, preventative health tips borne of life experience; things that could have saved us physical discomfort — if not downright pain — and put our now-30-something bodies in better stead for the decades ahead. Tips like 'invest in an electric screwdriver!', for instance. We ended up assembling an enormous amount of IKEA furniture in the last decade or so and would have saved ourselves a lot of time and hand, wrist, and arm strain by shelling out for a decent 18W Black+Decker years ago.
One such piece of advice to save our aching back would be to invest in a decent chair for work and play. Enter Herman Miller and Logitech G with their latest gaming offering, the Vantum. Following on from the Embody — the first collaboration between the companies to offer gamers a premium gaming chair (a $1,695 / £1410 premium, no less) — the Vantum is billed as their "first-ever performance chair made specifically for gamers".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Layers Of Fear — recently quietly renamed from its working title Layers Of Fears — is a game that requires a bit of explanation. It shares its title with the 2016 game of the same name, and is being overseen by original developers Bloober Team. But it's neither a remake nor a reboot; although, in some ways, it's both of those things. It's more a "reimagining" of the whole Layers Of Fear series to date, as well as its apparent swansong. It incorporates ground-up remakes of the two-and-a-half existing games in the series in Unreal Engine 5, alongside a new gaiden chapter complementing the first game, and a brand-new framing narrative tying the whole lot together. 
I recently sat in on an early preview presentation of Layers Of Fear, chatting with creative director Damian Kocurek. Listeners to one very specific episode of the EWS podcast might recall that I'm something of a Layers Of Fear lore theorist, so of course I was delighted to nerd out over what this new(ish) game is all about. Similarly detail-oriented horror fans out there will hopefully share my excitement when I tell them that yes, the rats are back, and you can even catch a brief glimpse of the Rat Queen.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Banned from the NBA
Red Wing Shoes have shown off their pair of replica kicks made in celebration of the upcoming Super Mario Bros. Movie. Unfortunately, they’re not selling them.
The company shows the creation process in a video that would be effective ASMR if they didn’t underline it with dramatic music. With painstaking stitching, a bit of hammering, and some good old-fashioned glue, they put a bunch of dead cows together to create the sort of shoes that kids get made fun of for wearing at school. The shoes appear to be officially sanctioned by Nintendo, but if not, this company is very excited about the Super Mario Bros. Movie.
https://youtu.be/YAm8GK47cDw
Once again, the caveat here is that you cannot buy these shoes, not in the usual shoe sense where they were all bought up by scalpers and are being resold for a few jillion dollars, but in the literal sense where they’re simply not up for sale. This is possibly because the Mario games have shown that they are deadly weapons capable of crushing anything without a hard shell.
Not that I would personally want to. They have laces. No one has time for laces. Do kids even know how to tie laces anymore? Kids these days…
On the other hand, this is great advertising for Red Wing Shoes.  I had never heard of them, but there are some nice boots here! This may surprise you, but video game people like myself don't have much need for a practical pair of work boots. I do stub my toe sometimes, but not enough that I need some safety-toed boots to wear at my desk.

Mickey, Goofy, Donald and chums are preparing y to crash into a stand full of screaming fans in a fiery wreckage, as licensed racer Disney Speedstorm is preparing to leave the starting grid and burn into Early Access April 18.
While the final release of the curious new road-ripper will be free-to-play, the Early Access edition will only be open to those who have purchased one of the various special editions of the title, all of which feature various unlockable characters as well as an abundance of (quite literal) Mickey Mouse Money. Once the Early Access period — which will take place on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Switch platforms — concludes, then Disney Speedstorm will launch proper as a free-to-play release.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Q7DoSIDyBg&ab_channel=PlayStation
"We’re eager for fans to start their engines by joining us on the Disney Speedstorm racetracks throughout Early Access and battle each other as iconic racers on stunning tracks inspired by Disney and Pixar films," says Gameloft's game manager Aska Suzuki. "We can’t wait to hear our community’s feedback and to work together to create a game that is reactive to the needs and wants of the players as we plan to offer a constantly evolving racing experience."
The three Disney Speedstorm pre-order packages are as follows. Each contains Early Access... access.
Standard Founder’s Pack ($29.99 / €29.99)
Early access to Disney Speedstorm
Deluxe Founder’s Pack ($49.99 / €49.99)
Early access to Disney Speedstorm
Ultimate Founder’s Pack ($69.99 / €69.99)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Can I expense this?
Devolver Digital has begun rolling out their bespoke arcade title, House of the Gundead, and you can order yours today (for $5500).
Drawing from Enter the Gungeon and inspired by House of the Dead, House of the Gundead is a light gun shooter; the type you’d find in bowling alleys. While LCD displays have largely led to a major decline in light gun games, House of the Gundead uses a pair of shiny Shinden light guns for allegedly pixel-perfect aiming. It also has some absolutely fab cabinetry, with great artwork and a big, big 43” screen.
Not only that, but the game itself looks fun. Drawing from the cute, cartoony style of Enter the Gungeon, it’s a far cry from your usual Time Crisis. I’m honestly having difficulty saying more about it because I’m taken in by its visuals.
I really want to play it. It’s too bad arcades are a myth.
[embed]https://youtu.be/N1R4eVLxTP4[/embed]
I’m hoping House of the Gundead gets ported eventually. I recently put money down on a Sinden light gun because if it does what it says on the box – and I have no reason to believe it doesn’t – then it’s an exciting prospect. I’m not a gun person by any means, but I love the physicality of the experience. At least I can afford one of those. I’m not sure where I’d put an arcade cab in my postage-stamp-sized apartment, but if Devolver would like to send me one for review (wink wink), I would be willing to throw my husband out to make space.
House of the Gundead is available for order right now in arcade cabinet format only.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recorded at Abbey Road Studios.
To celebrate the launch of Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon today, Nintendo has launched a new music video showcasing how the game's main theme, 'Together in the Moonlit Forest', was recorded.
Performed by Lauren McGlynn with music from PlatinumGames' Hitomi Kurokawa, the song clocks in at just under six minutes in length, and it's absolutely beautiful. The wonderful Irish lyrics mixed with the whimsical melody really matches with the tone of the game perfectly; it's certainly a big departure from the mainline Bayonetta series, that's for sure!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Where we droppin', Bingo?
Epic Games juggernaut battle royale title Fortnite is about to get 100% more swoon-factor, as Resident Evil cuties Leon Kennedy and Claire Redfield are ready to grace The Ever-Decreasing Circle with their own unique brand of firepower and charged sexuality.
The iconic duo, who made their first appearance in Capcom's legendary survival horror release, Resident Evil 2, are the latest crossover characters to join Fortnite's literal who's who of pop culture stars. R.P.D. officer Leon comes equipped with his trusty assault knife and attache case Back Bling, though is sans his hip jacket, instead rocking his latter-game combat wear.
 
The fairer Redfield, much like Leon, is stylized after her Resident Evil 2 remake design, and is wearing her bootcut jeans and scarlet biker jacket combo. Claire is repping the Raccoon City Police Department's many locked doors with her R.P.D. Back Bling, and is wielding a special pickaxe stylized as a red-and-white umbrella — A tribute to the terrible bio-weapons manufacturer behind the fall of Raccoon City.
The Raccoon City Survivors pack featuring Leon & Claire is available now in Fortnite for 2,100 V-Bucks. And for much more of Mr. Kennedy, (no, not the wrestler), you can check out the long-awaited Resident Evil 4 remake, which launches on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms March 24.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last November, Game Freak released Pokémon Scarlet and Violet on Switch. The game quickly became one of the top-selling games in the history of the popular console, and now, it's time for the new generation to kick off within the popular Pokémon Trading Card Game. The inaugural Pokémon Scarlet & Violet expansion does more than just introduce the ninth generation of Pokémon into the TCG; it also implements a whole host of changes, not the least of which is a higher price tag for most items. 
However, along with that price increase come several benefits, including a new guarantee of three foil cards in every booster pack, plus the introduction of the silver border in the U.S. and other quality-of-life improvements with regards to the designs. The Pokémon Company sent over several booster packs for us to crack open and see what we could pull. While I was less frequently blown away by the big cards I pulled, this is one of the most robust galleries of "the coolest cards" articles I've done in a great many expansions. Partially, that is due to me enjoying seeing some of the newer Pokémon from Gen IX getting their first cards, but I can't help but think the increase in foil cards was to thank.
In total, the Pokémon Scarlet & Violet expansion introduces more than 190 new cards, including more than 10 new Pokémon ex cards, more than 30 Trainer cards, new Tera Pokémon, and tons of special-illustration Pokémon and Trainer cards. You can see the coolest cards we pulled from this expansion in the gallery below:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Publisher Perfect World and developer Black Wings have revealed Persona 5: The Phantom X, a new mobile spin-off game for iOS and Android devices. It will be free-to-play and feature in-game purchases. 
There's no release date for the game yet, but a playtest will begin March 29 in China, as reported by IGN. The visuals and gameplay look quite similar to Persona 5, which isn't surprising considering Atlus, the original makers of Persona 5, are supervising The Phantom X's development.
You can watch the game's reveal trailer below: 


IGN reports that the game focuses on the theme of "desire," and that much like in Persona 5, Phantom X members will be able to enjoy a day at school, take part in after-school activities, and of course, infiltrate various palaces by way of the Metaverse. 
Check out the Persona 5: The Phantom X gameplay trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see in the trailers above, Persona 5: The Phantom X is shaping up to be a pretty faithful spin-off to Persona 5. Here's hoping we all get to go hands-on with it soon. 

In the meantime, read Game Informer's Persona 5 review and then check out our review of Persona 5 Royal. Read our Persona 5 Strikers review after that.

Whatever your thoughts on No Man's Sky's journey so far, you have to respect the amount of effort that Hello Games puts into ever improving the game with constant updates. One such patch has now been announced and this one is all about getting rid of some pesky bugs that cropped up in the recent 'Fractal' update.
The ver. 4.15 update is now live on Steam and will be heading to all other consoles soon, according to Hello Games. While some of the issues tackled this time around are unique to consoles other than the Switch (because they exist, apparently), there are plenty of fixes that will be coming Nintendo's way.

This project was taken on by YouTuber Retro Stash Repairs, who decided to give the brilliant little GBA SP a brand new lease of life, brick by brick (thanks, Kotaku). To be clear, this isn't just a standard version of the console with a bunch of LEGO pieces stuck to the outside, this is a bespoke casing made entirely out of LEGO, with the interior workings of the console added in.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over here, stranger
The impact that Resident Evil 4 had on the industry can't be overstated. Mechanics that were refined in the title, such as the aiming and over-the-shoulder camera, became widespread in the console generation that followed. QTE events caught on in a big way, and set-piece moments became focal points in many big titles. Some of the best and worst parts of modern game design were first popularized in the 2005 title. As meandering and unfocused as it could be, it's an important and well-loved title.
When the Resident Evil 4 remake was announced, like many people, I wondered how Capcom would approach the most over-the-top and ridiculous elements that seem so out-of-place in the drab, monotonous high-budget market. Now I know the answer.

There are two entirely different audiences for the Resident Evil 4 remake: those who have played the original game, perhaps multiple or even dozens of times over the last 18 years, and people who have never played it, but want to know what the fuss is all about.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the run-up to its original 2005 release, Capcom was refreshingly - and publicly - clear about their intentions for Resident Evil 4. Feeling that the classic fixed-camera formula that had seen the series thrive during the 90s had grown stale, this follow-up was to be a total reinvention of survival horror as a concept. Something fresh. Dynamic. Exciting. The slate was wiped completely clean, and from that blank canvas, something exceptional was created. A game that not only redefined the franchise, but third-person action games as a whole.
For eighteen tumultuous years, Capcom has tried to surpass the success of Resident Evil 4. The fifth and sixth entries doubled down on the action to mixed results, while seven and eight focused on scares as seen from a first-person viewpoint. Meanwhile, 2019’s Resident Evil 2 remake looked to the past for its inspiration, delivering a masterful retread that blended responsive third-person combat with the exquisite production values of the series’ more modern titles. But with the release of Resident Evil 4 remake, Resident Evil has finally come full circle. Whereas the original release was a rejection of the games that came before, this remake is instead a celebration of where the series went next. Action-focused combat. Photo-realistic environments. Gooey monsters, hammy characters, ridiculous storylines. What better way to remake the highest peak of the series, than to build it upon the foundations of the very games it went on to inspire? Resident Evil 4 is a rambunctious thrill ride that is as good - if not, dare I say it, a bit better - than the original game.

Yo Destructoid, it’s ya boy Tim “The Poké-man” Monbleau, filling in for Chris Carter with an important PSA. I know y'all can’t sleep until we report whether the newest 7-Star Raid Pokemon can breed or not, and I’m here to deliver you the good news. Decidueye can, in fact, lay eggs. Here’s what you need to do.
[caption id="attachment_369210" align="alignnone" width="640"] Screenshot by Destructoid[/caption]
Bring Decidueye and Ditto to a picnic
Just like with Greninja and Cinderace, you can get a Rowlet egg by bringing Decidueye and Ditto to a picnic. For best results, remove all other Pokemon from your party to ensure Rowlet will appear as an egg. This effectively circumvents the “only one Decidueye can be caught per save file” rule of the 7-Star raid, though baby Rowlet won’t have the Mightiest Mark title. Use this trick to hook your friends up with Decidueye if they miss the event!
For more information, check out our guide to find Ditto here. We also have a detailed guide on egg hatching here. If you plan to hatch a lot of eggs, consider getting a Pokemon with the Flame Body ability as well. I've maybe written too much about this video game.
[caption id="attachment_369211" align="alignnone" width="640"] Screenshot by Destructoid[/caption]
In Pokemon Scarlet & Violet, Rowlet still evolves into Dartrix at level 17, and Decidueye at level 34
As always, all you need to evolve your Rowlet is good old level grinding. For best results, use your EXP candies on Rowlet to level it up fast. If you’ve run the 7-Star Decidueye Raid, there’s a good chance you have more than a few EXP items to spare.
This has been your Tim “The Poké-man” Monbleau PSA of the day. Rest easy with this valuable knowledge in your noggin.

Pokemon Scarlet & Violet took a little raid detour these past few weeks. First, we had the unorthodox Pikachu event to celebrate Pokemon day. Then we had the 5-Star Walking Wake and Iron Leaves events run for two weeks straight (which will return in the near future). Now we’re back to business as usual, with a fierce 7-Star encounter against the final evolution of a previous game’s starter.
Let’s go over how to unlock and subsequently find Decidueye.
Here are when the Pokemon Scarlet & Violet Decidueye events start

The RPG prequel to The Messenger arrives on Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One on August 29 alongside the other versions. The developer made the announcement on its Kickstarter page, writing, 
“Since the very beginning, we were secretly hoping to be able to cover all current and previous generation consoles. With production being a world of curve balls, we had to leave the messaging at 'PC and Consoles' to avoid having to walk some things back. With the big unknowns now in the rear view, we are delighted to finally confirm the addition of Xbox to the party!”
Additionally, Sabotage revealed that Sea of Stars’ playable demo, currently available only on Switch, will make its way to other platforms later this year.
You can learn more about Sea of Stars by checking out our cover story. Sea of Stars will also be available on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[That planet is cracked
Dying Light studio Techland has published a teaser for its next project. Though still unnamed, the new fantasy title got a slice of concept art today.
On Twitter, Techland shared the art of its newest game. It's set to be a narrative-driven fantasy epic, with an "exotic open world" to explore.
"We strive to create a compelling story-focused AAA title that combines and refines the best aspects of gameplay that Techland is known for," reads the post.
https://twitter.com/TechlandGames/status/1636378215550976001
What can we see? Well, we've got a man holding onto a tree, observing a far-off city. There's some wildlife about, and some waterfalls, and off in the distance is a big, cracked planet. Not too much to go on for now other than vibes, though vibes seem squarely set in the sci-fi fantasy realm. And given Techland's proclivity for movement in the Dying Light series, probably some free-running at some point.
Sweet, sweet fantasy
It's interesting to see Techland turn to fantasy, after doing so much work in the zombie genre. But I do like the idea of some of that parkour-centric development bleeding over into a more out-there world. It reminds me of the new project from IO Interactive, where the team over there is also working on its own fantasy title.
Techland had teased an open-world fantasy game with RPG elements back in 2016, though it clarified that it has RPG elements, but is not an RPG game. Whatever the case may be, I'm definitely interested in seeing what Techland has been cooking up for its fantasy project.

Bayonetta Origins is stealing the show this week, given that it's published by Nintendo and features a pretty well known IP. Of course, you're probably wondering whether or not it's worth the full $60 price point. Well, we have a review for that! Some of you may want to wait for a price drop, but others will have a pretty good time diving into this storybook adventure.
Have a Nice Death is also worth a look, and has been in Early Access on PC for a bit. It deals with a business-oriented put-upon cartoon version of Death, who needs to "restore order" with the help of Death Inc and his associates. Both of these are in addition to...well...a ton of other games coming to the eShop this week (vaguely gestures to the bottom of this article).

Once upon a time, FMV games got a bad rap. Though once seen as cheesy and outdated, modern releases such as Her Story, Telling Lies, Death Come True, and Immortality have offered refreshing takes on the genre. This is also the case we've seen in our hands-on preview of Murderous Muses. The developer D'Avekki Studios has you exploring a haunted art museum, and you're investigating who killed the artist behind the beautiful paintings inside. While the journey can be cryptic at times, Murderous Muses so far pulls off a striking FMV experience for those who love the genre.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last year, Dying Light 2 Stay Human studio, Techland, revealed the first look at its unannounced fantasy RPG that's now in development. Now, the studio has released another conceptual look at the game. 
Back when Techland revealed it was working on this game in May of last year, it referred to the unannounced game as a "AAA open-world action-RPG in a fantasy setting." Today's new concept art features some additional details, this time with more of a focus on how the game is a narrative-driven epic. 
"We never stop improving," Techland's tweet reads. "Our newest game is set to be a narrative-driven fantasy epic with an exotic open world ready to be explored. We strive to create a compelling story-focused AAA title that combines and refines the best aspects of gameplay that Techland is known for."

As you can see in the concept art above, this still-untitled game continues to look intriguing. Here's hoping we learn more soon!
While waiting to learn more, read our thoughts on Techland's latest in Game Informer's Dying Light 2 Stay Human review and then check out this other piece of concept art from Techland's in-development open-world fantasy RPG.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stranger Of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin will launch on Steam next month, and it's now available at a "new, affordable price", according to Square Enix. Not more affordable, just "affordable", which kind of implies that the old price for the Team Ninja action game was unaffordable. 

As of today, Stranger Of Paradise therefore costs £35/$40 from the Epic Games Store, down from £50/$60. Nobody tell them that a bunch of their other games still cost $70.

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2023/03/16/build-your-swamp-in-toads-of-the-bayou-a-new-deckbuilder-hitting-early-access-in-2024"/>
        <updated>2023-03-16T17:36:15.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fireshine Games, the publisher behind titles like Lies of P and Dredge, has revealed Toads of the Bayou, a new turn-based tactical game coming to Early Access on PC next year. 
Toads of the Bayou is the first game from La Grange, a new studio based in France, and it brings roguelike deckbuilding, settlement-building elements, and more to the strategy genre. In the game, players will control a band of toads looking for a place to call home in the swamps of the deep south. However, in order to protect your settlement, you'll need to fend off the evil Baron Samedi. Along the way, you'll grow your toad family, create more powerful decks, build a settlement, and more across each run. 
Check out the action for yourself in the Toads of the Bayou teaser trailer below: 


"Toads of the Bayou is about combining southern gothic spookiness and the sweet taste of cartoon memories into our own take on the turn-based tactical genre," La Grange game designer Alexandre Clement writes in a press release. "The goal for us was to allow the player to establish their place in this cursed environment and make them appreciate how hard they fought and what they stood for. Nothing is ever granted in the Bayou, and thriving against the Baron's evil forces is a real achievement." 
Toads of the Bayou will hit Early Access via Steam on PC sometime in 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dodgy reseller listings aside, the Steam Deck has spent its entire life thus far without even a temporary price drop. That ends today, as the Steam Spring Sale has launched with the first official Steam Deck savings - a 10% cut across the range - alongside the more expected dealsplosion of discounted games.
What’s more, this sale could also be the last time that the Steam Deck joins in a Steam sale, at least for a very long time. Lawrence Yang, a Valve designer who recently spoke to us about the Deck’s first year in the wild, has also told me that the company are "looking at this as a one-time deal in celebration of Steam Deck's anniversary." You’ll therefore have until March 23rd, when the Spring Sale ends, to seize a saving on the handheld PC before it returns to base pricing – maybe for good.
All three Steam Deck versions are part of the sale, shedding exactly 10% apiece. The 64GB model is down from £349 / $399 to £314.10 / $359.10, the 256GB model drops from £459 / $529 to £413.10 / $476.10, and the top 512GB model falls from £569 / $649 to £512.10 / $584.10. Unlike the sad old days of 2022, there’s no lengthy waiting period once you put your order in, though I wouldn’t be surprised if it takes the full two weeks of Valve’s one-to-two week delivery estimate, what with the likely surge in demand.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Publisher Bethesda Softworks and developer Arkane Studios have released a new story trailer for Redfall, and it features four of the vampiric big bads we'll be battling in Massachusetts this May. 
Running nearly three and a half minutes long, this trailer shows off quite a bit of the quaint (and vampire-ridden) town of Redfall. We see our heroes in action, utilizing special abilities like invisibility, as well as a healthy dose of vampires. We also get an introduction to The Hollow Man, Bloody Tom, Miss Whisper, and the Black Sun, four vampires who appear to be at the top of the food (blood) chain in town. 
Check them out for yourself in the Redfall story trailer below: 


As you can see, this new story trailer details quite a lot about what's going on in Redfall. There are hints at the corporation behind it all, the types of vampires we'll be facing off against, many of the locales we'll be shooting our way through, and much more. 
For more about the game, check out the Redfall developer deep dive held back in January, and then watch this trailer from October that invites you to a bloody night on the town. After that, read our Redfall preview for details on how you and your friends will take back the city this summer. 
Redfall hits Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC on May 2, 2023.

Sumo Digital announced via an exclusive reveal with IGN that The Texas Chain Saw Massacre will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on August 18, 2023. The studio also announced that a technical test would be held on May 25, 2023, before the game's launch later this year.
Check out the official Texas Chain Saw Massacre release date trailer for yourself below: 


Eligibility details for the upcoming technical test will be released by Gun Interactive and Sumo Digital on social media, so tune in there if you're interested.

It all started when I learned that Sons Of The Forest has a peaceful mode, which completely removes all the gross, yucky cannibals, leaving you to grapple with survival in relative peace and quiet. The first time I met up with Kelvin and we got to work, casually making our shitty shelter and stick storage, I perused the guidebook to see what’s next, and I spotted a planter. A planter? Okay, so I assume you can plant seeds and grow food, then? That’s really co-WAIT, wait, wait. You're telling me this is basically a farming sim?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Atari has revealed that it has acquired 12 classic arcade properties, including Berzerk and its sequel, Frenzy. 
Strangely, though, Atari did not reveal all 12 properties that it has acquired. In the press release announcing the news, the company only lists Berzerk and Frenzy. Atari simply says it has acquired a "dozen retro arcade games" so it's likely the other 10 properties are from the same era of arcade games as Berzerk and Frenzy. 
"Atari...announced today the acquisition of a dozen retro arcade games, including the '80s classics Berzerk and Frenzy," the press release reads. "Atari will seek to expand digital and physical distribution of the classic titles, create new games based on the IPs, and explore brand and merchandising collaborations."
Atari says Berzerk is "a top-down, multidirectional shooter designed by Alan McNeil that was released for arcades in 1980." It's perhaps best known for being the first arcade video game with speech synthesis. Following its arcade release, Berzerk was ported to the Atari 2600 and Atari 5200 by the console maker. Frenzy is actually a sequel to Berzerk first released in 1982. 
"Berzerk is one of those foundational games that so many people first encountered playing on an Atari console," Atari CEO Wade Rosen writes in the press release. "Berzerk, and the other titles included in this acquisition, are a perfect fit for our strategy of commercializing classic retro IP."
Who knows if we'll learn what the other 10 retro arcade properties Atari has acquired are – only time will tell. In the meantime, read Game Informer's review of Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration.

At the time of the movie's announcement, it was rumored that Gunn was going to direct it but that wasn't confirmed. However, Safran said he personally hoped Gunn would direct it. Yesterday, Gunn confirmed on Twitter that he will, in fact, direct "Superman: Legacy" with a heartfelt post.

More specifically, subscribers can play Kirby's Dream Land 2 (Game Boy), BurgerTime Deluxe (Game Boy), Side Pocket (SNES), and Xevious (NES). This new game drop comes just a few weeks after the latest, which saw Nintendo add Metroid Fusion (Game Boy Advance) to the service for Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscribers. 
Check out these four new NSO games in the trailer below: 


"Save the day on the Rainbow Islands in Kirby's Dream Land 2 and feast on arcade action in BurgerTime Deluxe, both of which are joining the Game Boy – Nintendo Switch Online collection," Nintendo's description of the trailer reads. "Plus, run the table in Side Pocket on the Super NES – Nintendo Switch Online Library and scroll your roll in Xevious on the NES – Nintendo Switch Online library. All four of these titles are available for Nintendo Switch Online members to play today." 
These four titles join a list of dozens more in the full NSO library. You can check out every NES, SNES, Game Boy, N64, Sega Genesis, and GBA game available via Nintendo Switch Online in our running list here.

At launch, Sims would go from nascent babies to walking, talking kids, skipping the infant years that teach them, for example, how to talk in Simlish, although that does sound like baby talk too. The new expansion adds a lot to Sim’s life stages, but the real show stealer here is a pesky bug that elongates babies. Yes, you read that correctly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The latest Steam Deck client update has added Valve’s local network game transfers feature – previously only available in beta form – to the Stable branch, marking a full launch for one of the most useful Steam Deck feature upgrades in months.


If you missed the local transfers beta release last month, know that the name is quite literal: it lets you transfer Steam game installs between your PC and your Steam Deck over a local network, rather than having to re-download them onto every device you own. It also works when transferring between a Steam Deck and another Steam Deck, or between two PCs. Valve have a little explainer here, but it’s simple enough that – for example – hitting the Install button for a game on your Steam Deck will automatically detect if your PC is on the same network, and start transferring as much as it can from the desktop instead of downloading the whole thing from scratch.


You can even opt into sending/receiving game data from PCs and Steam Decks owned by other people, so long as they’re also connected to the same local network. The biggest benefit seemingly comes to those with monthly data caps (morning, Yanks), as these transfers won’t usually involve any extra downloads. Even so, it’s a helpful addition for anyone on all-you-can-eat data as well, since local transfers are much faster than old fashioned installs.

        <updated>2023-03-15T16:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Heed my words, dear reader: Paranormasight: The Seven Mysteries of Honjo is best played if you go in knowing nothing about it. Zilch, zero, nada. Its twists and turns from the get-go have my brain doing mental gymnastics, not just in the game but in trying to figure out how to write around them for this review. I’m not going to spoil everything, but keeping your expectations completley wide open lets Paranormasight snake right on in and surprise you when you least expect it to. 
Here’s a quick elevator pitch: Paranormasight is a Squeenix-developed horror mystery visual novel about deadly rituals, ghost stories, curses, and the occult. Its subversive approach to classic visual novel staples make its puzzles feel smart and its horror scares hit hard. If you’re a fan of the thrills found in the Danganronpa and Zero Escape games, Paranormasight is like a bite-sized version of those two behemoths. It’s short, smart, and will keep you on your toes until the end.
So yeah, if that sounds like your thing, then have at it. From here on in, I'm going to be gabbing abut it in-depth.

Today, developer Criterion Games and publisher Electronic Arts announced Need for Speed Unbound – Volume 2, a title update that delivers new race types, rides, upgrades, events, challenges, cosmetics, and ways to interact with friends.
Need for Speed Unbound – Volume 2 aims to give players fresh ways to storm the streets of Lakeshore and compete. This update, which represents the first in a series of post-launch updates, introduces additional Endurance Events, new Rumble Races, and the ability to provoke cops into multiplayer chases with your friends. Volume 2 also adds 40 new challenges, including 3 new daily challenges to earn rewards like experience and money. 
New 30-second Hot Laps circuits are one way to race against the clock to earn new rewards, while Playlist Events offer more variety and major rewards like a Custom Lotus Emira Balmain Edition. Rewards in Volume 2 include new driving effects, poses, stickers, and more. You can see the trailer for the announcement below:


This update also adds the option to purchase the marked locations of all 100 Bears, 80 Street Arts, 80 Billboards, and 160 activities on your map for $5. That premium DLC unlock also includes an exclusive "Fury and Zen" clothing pack, which features a jacket, t-shirt, sweatpants, and cap.
Need for Speed Unbound – Volume 2 arrives on March 21 for all versions of the base game. For more on Need for Speed Unbound, check out our review here.]]></summary>

It is a manual job (slicing up spaceships for salvage) with an extra layer (unionism) to elevate it far beyond what it could have gotten away with. In this way it seems a lot like my beloved PowerWash Simulator (washing things; time travel).
The main thrust of the game I can really get behind - peeling apart big metal ships like clanky onions - but the more literal thrust, i.e. the moving around in zero gravity using a jetpack, is awful. I need you to give me a frame of reference for if you all felt this way at the start, because, genuinely, I am so bad at Hardspace: Shipbreaker that it makes me want to cry.

Because yes, instead of bopping along to its excellent, punchy rhythm action combat and, you know, actually playing the damn thing, I've spent most of my early hours with Hi-Fi Rush fiddling about with image sliders and lining up Chai and best video game cat bot 808 into daft, stupid poses for the sake of a good screenshot.

But the film shouldn’t be too sad since it’s received the biggest prize of all: a Pac-Man-like video game adaptation as a free game in your web browser. “It was an interesting challenge,” says Cogs & Marvel’s creative director, Jon Hozier-Byrne. “How can you tell a complex story in the simplest narrative form?” The answer is Banshees: The Game, a short, hilarious, 8-bit game that you can play right here.

Ah, achievements. Never mind if they're good or bad. Today, we're remembering the terrible things we've done to actually get them.
The question comes courtesy of Fachewachewa, who asked: What's the worst thing you've done for an achievement? Or more generally, a time you were focused on a specific goal in a game, reached it (or gave up), and after, looked back and thought, "Why did I do that?" 
Why, indeed. Come and find out which achievements have spawned our biggest gaming regrets, and why not tell us about your own gaming follies in the comments? We can all wallow in our foolishness together.

The game’s sandy dunes and over-the-top combat gave Ed chirpy AA vibes, whle the rest of us were relegated to the initial CG trailer and the hands-off preview. Until now. Publisher Focus Entertainment have now debuted a gameplay trailer for all of us, too - although it mostly consists of second-long combat snippets, sandwiched in between very grave and serious and important VO.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Citizen Sleeper is finally coming to PlayStation, and you don't have to wait too much longer. That's because the tabletop-inspired, sci-fi RPG hits PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 on March 31.
PlayStation and Citizen Sleeper developer, Jump Over The Age, who is actually just solo developer Gareth Damian Martin, announced this today in a new PlayStation Blog post. The game will launch with all of its DLC on PlayStation, including Episode 1: Flux, Episode 2: Refuge, and the upcoming Episode 3: Purge. 
I reviewed Citizen Sleeper last year, giving it a 9 out of 10 and calling it a Game Informer Must Play game. You can find out why in my review here. It was also in Game Informer's top 10 games of 2022, and you can read about where we placed it here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nightdive Studios’ long-awaited remake of System Shock finally has a release date, at least for PC. The reimagined classic arrives on May 30.
For those keeping score, this announcement also acts as another delay, as System Shock had been scheduled to release this month. The game will be available first on Steam, The Epic Store, and GOG for $39.99, while the PlayStation and Xbox versions will release at an unspecified later date. 
System Shock has been in the works in some form since at least 2016, beginning life as a crowd-funded passion project that aims to revitalize the 1994 classic. The remake overhauls the adventure with modernized graphics and controls, a redesigned UI, and more, but the villainous A.I. SHODAN is still voiced by her original performer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bandai Namco revealed Tekken 8 last September and since then, the company has been slowly teasing more information about this upcoming fighter. We've seen gameplay, the reveal of Nina Williams' return, and just last week, we learned Paul Phoenix would be riding into Tekken 8 as well. 
Now, Bandai Namco has revealed that Marshall Law will be in the Tekken 8 roster in a new gameplay trailer. Marshall Law was introduced to the series in the very first Tekken game and he's been in quite a few since, including the most recent release in the franchise, Tekken 7. If you're familiar with this fighter, his heavy-hitting combos return in Tekken 8, if this new gameplay trailer is anything to go on. 
Check out the Marshall Law gameplay trailer for yourself below: 


Tekken 8 does not yet have a release date but when it does launch, it will do so on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. For more information about the game, head to Game Informer's Tekken 8 hub.

Sure, it's not quite as bad as 'death by exploding sun' in Outer Wilds, say, but when each crash is also accompanied by heroine Junon reliving a harrowing memory from her past that she'll need to sort through and analyse before she's able to (quite literally) move on with her life, I reckon that one-two punch of sudden physical trauma and deep, emotional soul-bearing is probably just about on par with having skin and muscle seared off your own bones by a honking great supernova. You know, figuratively speaking.

Few games in recent memory etched a permanent smile on my face the way Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon has. This prequel to the Bayonetta series rewrites its mature-rated stylish combat within the whimsical pages of a storybook, spinning an endearing yarn of a young witch fighting to prove herself while forming an unlikely friendship. The result is an eye-catching, unexpectedly dense adventure that has more charm than it knows what to do with.

That means you can play Valheim on PC via PC Game Pass, Steam, Microsoft, Humble Stores, and Xbox consoles starting today. Valheim is still coming together in early access on PC, and that remains the case on console as it's part of the equivalent Xbox Game Preview program. The game became really popular in 2021 for its unique setting within the survival genre. And simply put, the game's a great time, too.
Check it out in the Xbox release date trailer below:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Diablo IV, the long-awaited follow-up to 2012's Diablo III, will finally release this June, but it sounds like it won't be launching on Xbox Game Pass. 
That's because Blizzard's Diablo general manager, Rod Fergusson, recently revealed on Twitter that there are currently "no plans" to bring the upcoming game to Game Pass, as reported by Video Games Chronicle. Presumably, people have been speculating that the game might come to Game Pass as Blizzard Entertainment and Xbox are close to teaming up by way of Microsoft's pending acquisition of Activision Blizzard. 
It's awesome seeing the excitement around the Diablo IV Beta, and our Wolf Pack puppy! We’ve been getting some questions about D4 on Game Pass and I want to let you know we have no plans for that. See you in Sanctuary during the Beta Early Access weekend starting on March 17!
March 13, 2023
As you can see in Fergusson's tweet above, there's no plans for Diablo IV to come to Game Pass. But Diablo IV is out June 6; perhaps there's time for plans to change (although I'm not betting on it, personally). 
In the meantime, if you preorder the game, you can hop into a closed beta starting tomorrow, March 17. That closed period runs until March 19 and then starting March 24, there will be an open beta that anyone can jump into. It runs until March 26. 
While waiting for these betas, read Game Informer's exclusive guided tour through Diablo IV's Sanctuary.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The High Court of Justice has issued a permanent injunction to stop a man filing copyright complaints against a rival's YouTube channels. As part of a fraudulent campaign against "the music mafia," the singer used copyright strikes and YouTube's repeat infringer policy to have a music publisher's channels suspended. The background to the dispute is nothing short of extraordinary.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pokémon fans are likely well acquainted with the Nuzlocke challenge: a self-imposed, community-made ruleset designed to make playthroughs tougher. Nuzlocke playthroughs have been around for at least a decade, but they’ve never received official in-game support until now. Kinda. In a different game. Creature-collecting MMO Temtem has added three new challenge modes (including Nuzlocke) as part of its Season 3: Clash Of Tamers. Patch 1.3 is also bringing a new area, an island worth of balance changes, and much more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To track the public understanding of modern-day indie gaming is to look at the small-scale independent development scene through an Anglo-centric lens. While it would be unfair to ignore the hobbyists programming experiences in BASIC on their ZX Spectrum or similar, it’s commonly accepted that indie gaming as we recognise it today has its roots in the early days of the internet and the Y2K boom, when Flash, Gamemaker Studio and similar tools allowed things like Cave Story and N to grow. With online distribution further helping games like Bastion, Journey and World Of Goo to flourish, the definition of the indie game became: a title with big ambitions and creativity grown from small budgets and teams.


It's not entirely wrong, but it has obscured decades of hobby development that was once at the forefront - not just the stories of BBC Micro solo-development stars, but similar ones of hobby development from around the world. In Japan, the doujin markets of Comiket and beyond serve as a home for hobbyists to make, sell and share their creations. It is the doujin gaming scene that helped major studios like Fate/ studio Type-Moon, and franchises like 07th Expansion and Touhou Project, flourish in a way that would never be possible otherwise.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Walking around the deserted streets of Los Angeles - and you can take your leisure, in Dead Island 2, because most zombies are quite shambly - I encountered many a rich-person decor. Last week, I was given a preview build of the upcoming first-person zombie-smasher and played about the first five hours of it in single-player, taking in sights like a community of gated millionaire mansions, a slightly less palacious but still ridiculous neighbourhood, and an upmarket hotel styled after the famous Beverly Hills Hotel. They're all full of weird stuff.
There's a panic room where a guy turned into a zombie mid-demo tape recording. Actress Emma, who you're battening down the hatches with, has a truly awful full-length Burt Reynoldsian portrait of herself. A shared house called the GOAT PEN, where a team of influencers all live together, has a set for a video series called LIT OR SH!T, and a whiteboard with the script for an apology video. I ask the game director David Stenton if it's low hanging fruit, or if there's no such thing with Hollywood rich people. "Of course, it's low hanging fruit!" he says, laughing. "And also, there's no such thing."

Your job is to smash a lot of them to pieces with a hammer, like so many sausages and balloons full of blood held together by sellotape. In the course of this, you find yourself merrily looting your way through the homes of the rich and famous, stuffing as many screws and bits of scrap metal into your pants as the elastic can handle (I assume; none of the player character options has a backpack).

Blinking for the first time in Before Your Eyes is a genuinely magical moment. I don’t mean hitting a button to close your virtual eyes. Through the power of a webcam, Before Your Eyes tracks when you blink which allows you to progress through a wonderful narrative adventure title from GoodbyeWorld Games. It may seem like a novel gimmick on the surface, but the mechanic is used so inventively that it meaningfully enhances the al…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As our resident walking simulator enthusiast, I was instantly onboard when Alice Bee asked me to play a new game exploring a forest. I'm always up for a wander in the woods. I am a bit of a genre purist so with a name like Sons Of The Forest, I was concerned it might be another of those so-called walking sims that are more concerned with making you listen to a Radio 4 dramatic monologue. Thankfully, no, this is simply a pretty walking simulator exploring an island bustling with wildlife. Here, enjoy this video with some sights from my peaceful strolls.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the best things games can do is bring you an appreciation of something you've never thought about before. You'll probably start out Zellige thinking "oh, it's making some shapes and they turn into a pattern, whatever". But within ten minutes you'll be actively saying things like "does the empty space over here feel like purity or desolation" and "what does the contrasting colour of these triangles say about their relationship with the central star?".

It's been a while since I played a game about creating art that felt effortless even as I put in a lot of effort. Zellige: The Tilemaker Of Granada is humble but delightful. It's about designing tiles. And why something that straightforward is also rich and complicated.

Luckily, puzzle is a mainstay genre in video games, from classic point 'n' click adventures to weirdo physics puzzles and aliens in space. Puzzle games can also be RPGs or adventure games; they can have horror or hacking. There are so many, in fact, that curating a list of the best puzzle games is something of a puzzle in itself. But at RPS we like a challenge, so we've brought you a new and improved list of the 25 best puzzle games on PC that out there today, in 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fan-favorite fighter Paul Phoenix has punched his ticket (among other things) for Tekken 8, and he’s so excited that he’s let his hair down for the first time in years. 
A new trailer shows off Paul’s new look and familiar offense of dishing out powerful, flame-licked punches. At one point, he flexes his bicep so hard that it makes the sleeve of his leather jacket explode off of his arm. He also rides his motorcycle into battle, which is pretty cool and reemphasizes that he is, in fact, a biker. Paul joins previously announced fighters such as Kazuya, Jin, Nina, and others. 


Tekken 8 doesn’t have a release date, but there’s a solid chance it’s arriving later this year for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Until recently, the story of Intel’s Arc GPUs has been a litany of mild disappointments. After years of it being easier to buy an original O’Keefe than a reasonably priced graphics card, the Arc series brought hope that it might actually be possible to get a decent PC upgrade for less than £500. Then they were repeatedly delayed, confirmed to possess some unwelcome technical quirks (like wanting Resizable BAR on at all times), and ultimately released with merely decent-ish performance. Nothing awful, but nowhere near as special as they once seemed like they could be.
In 2023, however, Intel Arc may be on a redemption... arc. A series of driver updates, Intel claims, have improved average FPS performance by up to 87% since launch, with major gains in frame times (the time between each new rendered frame) as well. The specific model we have here, the Arc A750 Limited Edition, has also had its price cut from £330 / $289 to  £250 / $250. More power for less money? I’d say that’s worth a fresh evaluation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Outlast Trials, the third entry in the popular horror franchise, will welcome players into its twisted world when it enters PC Early Access on May 18. 
A new trailer reveals the news in a rather unique fashion, showcasing voice performers recording the horrific screams, yells, and grunts that will unnerve players in the game. The game was first announced in 2019, and developer Red Barrels gave players their first hands-on sample of the game via a closed beta last October. The ETA for the full release remains shrouded in mystery, however. 


The Outlast Trials mixes up the formula of the previous entries by letting you play alongside friends in four-player co-op (although you can still play solo). The game unfolds in a secret facility during the Cold War, with players controlling involuntary test subjects being tortured in gruesome experiments. Avoiding enemies instead of confronting them remains the key the survival, though you obtain and upgrade tools that can increase your odds at staying hidden or slowing foes down. 
You can check out The Outlast Trials in early access on Steam and The Epic Store.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fatal Frame: Mask Of The Lunar Eclipse plunges players into the dreadful past of Rougetsu Island as three (Young women? Girls? I have no idea how old they are supposed to be and for some reason that’s not surprising.) survivors and a stalwart detective revisit the ruins of a hospital that was once home to a haunting ceremony. They all have amnesia, of course, because that’s a low-effort way to generate an air of mystery. Well, except the detective, who is just confused because he never really figured out what was going on in the first place. 
Overall, it’s a thoroughly okay game from 2008 that’s been papered over with some hazy lofi graphics to justify selling it at full price in 2023. It’s up to you if you think that’s worth it – I bought the Mass Effect remaster, so I’m hardly one to judge – but while the graphics have been thoroughly airbrushed, that’s no cure for Fatal Frame’s dated gameplay and undead pacing.

As a cooperative team-based multiplayer game, Exoprimal is an always-online experience and will feature season passes with a number of unlockable rewards, such as cosmetics. Those itching to try the game early can jump into a free open beta that runs March 17 to 19, but you'll need to register for a Capcom ID to play. Exoprimal will be available on PlayStation and Xbox consoles and PC. It will also launch on Xbox Game Pass.]]></summary>

RoboCop: Rogue City is the latest to try. Last year's Nacon Connect stream featured an underwhelming "gameplay reveal"; this year's Nacon Connect features a "gameplay overview".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With less than a month to go until the theatrical release of The Super Mario Bros. Movie, Nintendo, Illumination, and Universal have released one final trailer to try and catch prospective audience members' attention. The final trailer came by way of a livestreamed Nintendo Direct featuring the main cast (including Chris Pratt, Charlie Day, Keegan Michael-Key, Seth Rogen, Anya Taylor-Joy, and Jack Black), as well as directors Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic.
The trailer gives us a more in-depth look at the Mario Kart sequences, which take place on the iconic Rainbow Road course. Along the way, we get Easter eggs, including side-scrolling sequences, shortcuts in Mario Kart courses, and even nods to Bob-omb Battlefield and Tostarena. To coincide with the release of this new trailer (which you can view below), we received a new synopsis of The Super Mario Bros. Movie.
Jurassic World and The LEGO Movie franchises) and brother Luigi (Charlie Day; It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia) are transported down a mysterious pipe and wander into a magical new world. But when the brothers are separated, Mario embarks on an epic quest to find Luigi.
The Lion King) and some training from the strong-willed ruler of the Mushroom Kingdom, Princess Peach (Anya Taylor-Joy; The Queen’s Gambit), Mario taps into his own power.
Jumanji films) as Bowser, Seth Rogen (Neighbors franchise) as Donkey Kong, Fred Armisen (Portlandia, Saturday Night Live) as Cranky Kong, Kevin Michael Richardson (American Dad!, Family Guy) as Kamek and Sebastian Maniscalco (Green Book) as Spike, plus a special voice appearance by Charles Martinet, who has voiced the characters of Mario and Luigi in the Super Mario games for more than 30 years.
Teen Titans Go!, Teen Titans Go! To the Movies) from a screenplay by Matthew Fogel (Minions: The Rise of Gru, The LEGO Movie 2: The Second Part).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During today's Nacon Connect presentation, developer Teyon showed off new gameplay of the upcoming RoboCop: Rogue City. The game puts you in the metallic shoes of Alex Murphy as you explore Detroit in what appears to be a high-octane, technologically advanced first-person shooter.
RoboCop: Rogue City not only gives you the tech-enhanced combat capabilities of the eponymous protagonist but also gives you the ability to make dialogue choices as you meet new characters. This lets you decide how to fulfill your objectives, but as you might have guessed, the developers intend to throw various twists in a story about corruption and greed. Actor Peter Weller, who portrayed Murphy in the original films, is scheduled to reprise his role in the game.
You can see the action unfold for yourself below.


Developer Teyon was founded in 2006 and has released nearly 100 games since. Its most noteworthy releases include other licensed titles starring '80s action IP, including 2014's Rambo: The Video Game and 2019's Terminator: Resistance. RoboCop: Rogue City arrives in September for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I really enjoyed the first Figment when it released back in 2017. An action-platformer with a musical theatre twist using the human mind as its stage? Very creative! Bedtime Studios’ follow-up Figment 2: Creed Valley keeps very close to the beat of the first one. You don’t need to have played Figment 1 to enjoy this sequel, but I almost feel like you’d be missing you if you didn’t (especially as it’s free on Steam right now, for today only).
Figment 2 has all the visual flair and catchy sing-songs of the first, but it feels weirdly smaller. Both games will run you about 5 hours each, but Figment 2 is a little less punchy, a little less diverse, and feels more like an encore rather than a dazzling comeback album. That’s not necessarily bad; I love an encore, and I enjoyed seeing more of Figment's surreal, subconscious mind-world. But, yeah, it’s very much the same as the first game, but with less scope and fewer fart clouds.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As part of our Resident Evil 4 cover story last month, we showed off a slice of Chapter 5 gameplay in which some fans called out the heavy rain effects for being too intense and distracting. Capcom has heard those complaints and plans on changing the rain to make it more palatable. 
In an interview with Press Start Australia (thanks IGN), the outlet asked RE4 producer Hirabayashi Yoshiaki if the team was aware of the negative response to the rain, and he had this to say: 
“We’ve seen everyone’s reaction to the rain effects, and we are working on a day-one patch to make adjustments”
So there it is. It looks like “raingate” will soon be a thing of the past, and it’s nice that Capcom recognized the complaints ahead of Resident Evil 4’s release.  
Resident Evil 4 launches on March 24 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PC. To learn more, be sure to visit our cover story hub for a month’s worth of exclusive features.

On Friday, the Deeply Volatile Kemono Set adds the Hellfire Laharback creature for players to hunt alongside an accompanying quest and a new skill. On March 23, the Subspecies Kemeno Pack goes live, which introduces the wolf-like Grimstalker plus a new quest and new weapon/armor model. This update also adds more higher-difficulty quests, three new emotes, and three chat stamps.
Koei Tecmo also confirmed in a Twitter thread that the first update includes unspecified technical fixes too, and plans to share more specifics tomorrow. A tease for April’s DLC offerings teases new Kemeno, Karakuri, and other updates.
Looks like Wild Hearts fans will have plenty to keep them busy in the immediate future, and the (hopefully) performance improvements, whatever they may be, are a welcomed bonus. To learn more about Wild Hearts, you can read our review here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Far be it from me to get excited about games that have just been announced, but the reveal trailer for Galacticare has slapped this management game right onto the old radar. An intergalactic radar, in fact, because this is a hospital management game - in spaaaaace! - coming later this year. It's from a Brighton-based indie studio called Brightrock Games, and it sort of looks like Theme Hospital with a space skin, or Startopia with a hospital sim. Neither option is a bad thing, in my opinion.

Besides the fact that it’s cheaper than buying an equivalent, prebuilt gaming rig, the DIY PC approach gives you more control over its components, teaches you skills you can later apply when upgrading or troubleshooting, and perhaps most importantly, isn’t anywhere near as difficult as it looks. Especially if you have a convenient, step-by-step guide to building a PC to hand. Incidentally…

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Clash: Artifacts Of Chaos is nails, mate. And that's coming from someone who recently reviewed Team Ninja's Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty, a game that's mighty good at grinding people into paste. I'm not trying brag; I'm being vulnerable with you. I have a case of the Ben Affleck blues, where most sessions of Clash's third-person action-adventuring have me veering from elation to being slumped against a wall with Affleck's signature grimace on my face.
Aside from being really difficult, I'm a bit undecided on how I feel about Clash in the portions I've played so far. It looks fantastic and puts some brilliant spins on combat, but levelling is a bore and exploration has a confusing edge. It's at once both a grand time and an annoying one. The surreal lands of Zenozoik, it turns out, aren't all sunshine and turkey men. There are a lot of turkey men, though.

That's because the SSD offers excellent performance while working within the confines of the SATA interface, with straightforward TLC NAND flash and a DRAM-equipped design that ensures strong sustained performance - something lacking in QLC DRAM-less designs. 
Today, the Crucial MX500 in its 2TB capacity is down to $102.99 at Amazon US, making it nearly 50% off its MSRP and the lowest price we've ever recorded.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new firmware update hitting the PlayStation 5 today will add Discord voice chat along with other fan-requested features.
The update allows users to link their Discord and PSN accounts to chat with friends through the app. Xbox received the same support last summer, so we’re happy to see it appear on another major platform. You can read more about how to get Discord up and running by visiting the PlayStation Blog. 
Additionally, the update introduces variable refresh rate support for 1440p, allowing smoother visuals for VRR-compatible HDMI 2.1 displays at 1440p resolution. The game library now filters PSVR and PSVR 2 titles. Data transfer between different PS5 consoles has also been added, and PS4-to-PS5 save data transfer has been significantly streamlined. Be sure to visit the PlayStation Blog for the complete rundown of what the update has to offer.

Although it was announced as part of a promo event for AMD’s Radeon RX 7000 GPUs, Infinite’s ray tracing works on any graphics card that can usually handle RT effects; all you need to do is download the update and flick it on in the display settings.
Granted, it’s not the most visually sumptuous form of ray tracing I’ve clapped a visor on. Reflections and global illumination are unchanged, as it’s only sun shadows – shadows cast using a simulated sun as the light source – that get the RT treatment.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Starfield, Bethesda's mammoth-sized space RPG, is launching on September 6, the publisher announced in a video today. Additionally, a presentation showcasing more of the game called Starfield Direct will air on June 11. 
In a new video hosted by game director Todd Howard, he states the Direct in June – which happens to be the weekend before E3 starts – will provide a "deep dive" into the game. He reiterates that Starfield is a unique experience that also has many of the hallmarks fans expect from a Bethesda title. We last saw Starfield during the Xbox Game Showcase last summer, where Bethesda revealed its extensive scope, including thousands of planets, spaceship construction, environmental scanning, and other features. 


Starfield was originally slated to launch on November 11, 2022, before getting delayed. It was later reconfirmed to launch within the first half of 2023, and though September sits on the second half of the calendar, we're happy to see the game get a concrete date again. 
Starfield will be available on Xbox Series X/S and PC and will also launch day one on Xbox Game Pass.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Publisher Chucklefish announced Wargroove 2 today, a sequel to its well-received Advance Wars-inspired strategy RPG. 
Developed by Robotality, Wargroove 2 is set three years after the first game, with a new faction looking to use ancient technology to conquer the now-peaceful land of Aurenia. The main story unfolds across three interconnected campaigns set on land, the sea, and the sky and features a new cast of commanders. It also features a new roguelike campaign called Conquest that tasks players to complete a series of smaller battles while making permanent choices and relying on the same pool of units, health, and resources. 


Wargroove 2 features four-player co-op and versus battles (local and online) along with rule customization and asynchronous play. An in-game editor allows players to create custom maps, campaigns, and even cutscenes to share with other players. 
The first Wargroove was lauded as a fun throwback to Advance Wars when it launched in 2019, so we’re excited to see what Chucklefish has in store for the follow-up. Wargroove 2 doesn’t have a release window, but it’s slated to launch on Switch and PC. You can read out review of the first game here.]]></summary>

Until this week, it had never been localized for North America, but starting March 9, it will be available on just about every platform with improved visuals and a new photo mode. Fatal Frame is a game all about fighting ghosts in haunted locations with a magic camera, but this will be the first time you can pause the game and take pictures in the contemporary "photo mode" way we are all now familiar with.
This episode of New Gameplay Today ended up being a long one, making it feel a bit closer to our Super Replay series where Marcus Stewart and myself have been playing classic horror games like Dino Crisis and Silent Hill. I promise we do encounter some ghosts, though – you just need to be patient.

Anyone who makes or writes music knows that the path to a complete track isn’t a linear one. It’s a process where instruments weave in and out of the composition on the whim of the person making it. And even when the vision is clear, and you know exactly where you want to take the song, be it behind a drum set, a keyboard, a loop track, or even a computer, things can get in the way. Rytmos, developer Floppy Club’s first non-mobile game, nails that feeling. It uses puzzles to extract the joy, escalation, triumphs, and trials of making music, and it does so with g…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Riot Games announced last month that three League of Legends games would arrive this year, including The Mageseeker: A League of Legends story. Now, the company has announced that The Mageseeker will hit consoles and PC next month. 
More specifically, The Mageseeker will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on April 18. It will cost $29.99 on digital storefronts, and preorders include the Lost Silverwing in-game bonus. You can also purchase the Digital Deluxe Edition for $39.99, and it includes additional digital items like a Silverwing Supply Station Pack, Home Sweet Home cave decorations, exclusive spells, and Unchained skins. 
Check out the game in action in the new trailer below: 


"Developed by Digital Sun, creators of Moonlighter, the Mageseeker is a gritty 2D hi-bit pixel action RPG, set in Demacia, a mighty kingdom in the world of Runeterra that seeks to curtail what it deems as forbidden magic while wielding magic themselves to maintain order," a press release reads. "Play as Sylas, an escaped mage who joins a band of rebels in the deep forest. Their revolution will shatter Damcai's deceptive peace – a peace built with the blood and sweat of mages. The Mageseeker provides an action-packed fantasy gameplay experience for those looking to experience a story of power, identity, and justice." 
Riot Games also revealed today that it is selling a physical Collector's Edition of the game for $169.99. It includes a Sylas statue, an art book, a deluxe art print, the Lux Comic (special edition hardcover), Sylas & Lux enamel pins, and a vinyl soundtrack. All of this comes housed within an exclusive custom box. 

The Mageseeker follows the release of 2021's League of Legends Story game, Ruined King. Check out our thoughts on that in the Game Informer's Ruined King: A League of Legends Story review. The other two games Riot Games plans to release this year are Song of Nunu and Convergence.

First off, our team developers have implemented a significant update to the file access system in order to use the Secure Access Framework (SAF) API for secure file access on external memory space, such as SD Cards or USB drives. This effectively should resolve a long-standing issue with modern Android devices, in particular those running Android 11 and above, whereby users could not properly access the game data folders or the save game files in the external storage.

The intention of the program is to bring new contributors to open source projects, and the eligibility rules for participants are the same as last year, with both students and non-students welcome to participate. Check the  Google Summer of Code website for details of eligibility.
Participants can apply for either short tasks (about 175 hours) or long tasks (about 350 hours). The coding period typically runs from the start of June to the end of August, but there is some flexibility and the participants can opt to use a longer coding period if they are not available to work full time on the project during the summer.
ScummVM is looking for applicants! A list of suggested projects can be found on this page, but we’re open to your own ideas too. Please make sure you provide the required information in your application before submitting. We also strongly encourage you to join our Discord server and follow the #scummvm-gsoc channel where you can engage with our mentors and the rest of the team, and get advice and help on getting started with the project and writing your application.
We have gathered some information to guide you, based on our previous 15 years of experience in the program. You may start your exploration from our Google Summer of Code miniportal.
We are looking forward to your application and participation!
