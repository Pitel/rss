        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yes, I've played a portion of Elden Ring's expansion Shadow Of The Erdtree and I think it's brilliant. But there's one thing I didn't flesh out in the preview and that's the DLC's standalone levelling system, brought to our attention a month or so ago. Well, here I am to flesh it out! Be warned, though, the role of the system is a jarring thing to condense into words.

But I'll obviously try and not be too spoilery for those who've decided to keep reading this, and hence, probably aren't as SPOILER sensitive. Right, onwards.
Life In Jars is this YouTuber I've followed for a while. He makes videos that might involve, say, scooping up some puddle water, leaving it in a sealed jar for a while, then coming back to it a few months later. He'll report on the results, which are often tremendous. Look at the LIFE in that jar! The little wriggly lads just wriggling around. The blobs whose job is to float and squidge indiscriminately. A lovely bit of fauna sloshing about there, like a forest dwelling for those who implement the five-second rule. It's a reminder that bog water is rather beautiful, actually.
Having spent three hours with Elden Ring expansion Shadow Of The Erdtree's opening area, I can't help but think of Life In Jars. What resides in the shadowy dome of the Big Tree is horrendous! Miserable! The forgotten creatures and their crumbling homes are grim. But oh my word, the shadows have spawned a beautiful disasterpiece. Just, errr, those other jars? The fun guys with the scoopy arms and little legs? Yeah. I have bad news.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I had a gut feeling that my time with the Elden Ring expansion Shadow of the Erdtree would kick off where it did. How else could it start but with Miquella? The hand of the Empyrean was one of the big lingering threads left after players rolled credits on FromSoftware’s open-world journey, and Shadow of the Erdtree is all about him, and the many mysteries surrounding him.


We recently got the chance to go hands-on with Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree, experiencing the expansion from the beginning. Even talking about how to get there will entail some degree of spoilers for Elden Ring's base game, but I’ll do my best to avoid too many unnecessary details about the actual expansion content itself. Discovery’s a big part of Elden Ring, and there is much to discover in the Realm of Shadow.

We got to go hands-on with it at an event hosted by Bandai Namco, and one surprising detail we learned about was an additional way to level up your character and their Spirit Ashes, alongside the usual runes and levels.


As part of the gameplay in Shadow of the Erdtree, the player can come across two different resources: Scadutree Fragments and Revered Spirit Ash Blessings. Each one corresponds to a different power scale that you can boost up at Sites of Grace within the Realm of Shadow.


Scadutree Fragments give you a boost, increasing the damage you can deal and decreasing damage taken. Even a few made a bit of a noticeable difference in our time with the Elden Rin…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft rolled out a minor update to address crossplay and party invite issues. As for susbtantial gameplay changes that's coming at a later date. 


Following the update today, XDefiant executive producer Mark Rubin confirmed that there will be another patch next week dedicated to bunny hopping, sniper, and hit registration changes. Rumors suggested that there would be major movement changes in Season 1, but in reality there will just be an aiming sway penalty added for jumping too many times in a row consecutively. 


As for snipers, Ubisoft plans on adding more flinch to the weapons so it's harder for the weapons to hit their shots. Finally, a segment of the player base has claimed that "‘terrible" hit detection is XDefian'ts biggest problem, and that's scheduled to get addresses as well. But for now, Ubisoft just rolled out a few minor backend changes. 


XDefiant June 4 update patch notes


Image via Ubisoft 


Here are the full XDefiant June 4 update patch notes. 


Social



While in a party, we now display the most restrictive Crossplay setting among the party members, as it applies to the whole party. Also fixed an issue where party members with differing Crossplay settings couldn't matchmake.


Fixed an issue with displaying incorrect player names on some Social screens.


Fixed a crash caused by spamming open/close View Party Invites, but who would even do that, calm down.


On consoles, Ubisoft Connect party invites could display as if they were coming from Xbox or PlayStation Network friends. Fixed that, along with some other weird invite-related things.



Miscellaneous



Fixed some missing terrain textures when players joined matches in progress on some maps.


Input-Based Matchmaking setting status now updates correctly after changing it on Xbox.


Fixed a thing on PS5 where people could sneak into places they shouldn't via PS5 Activities.


Security improvements, various.

Please feel free to try any of these on for size: Grunn’s shear sound is the Wilhelm Scream of gardening equipment, sure to be referenced for decades to come. Grunn’s shear sound wormed its way past my eyes and into parts of my brain I’d previously assumed could only be accessed by either masterful ASMR or irresponsibly long Q-tips. I used to have anxiety, but now, my only fear in life is that Grunn’s grass will run out, so I no longer have a reason to click away with its shears. Play Grunn, innit. There are, by the way, lots of other things to like about it, although I cannot hear them over the wonderful sound of these shears.

The hardest track ever created in Trackmania was published by a team of mappers on May 4th, bringing an intimidating 16-floor tower called Deep Dip 2 into the racing game. It became a magnet for competitive drivers after a prize pool of over $30,000 was offered to the first three players to conquer its hellish heights. The prize has yet to be claimed. Even today, determined racers continue to bang their heads against the brutally designed course, featuring icy surfaces, curving rails, and perilous loop-the-loops that hang kilometres about the ground. Some players have parked their hopes and given up. But others persevere. The top three players have reached the final floor and currently stand shoulder to shoulder, eyes focused on the prize.

Nintendo’s track record with LGBTQIA+ characters has been… mixed, to say the least. The Big N hasn’t exactly been the most forward company in making statements, even going as far as to say “we were absolutely not trying to provide social commentary" by not giving the option for same-sex relationships in the 3DS life-simulation game Tomodachi Life back in 2014.

Engineering a mech is a Herculean labour whose completion eludes today's puny scientists, and Mech Engineer doesn't aim to make life easier, whatever its putative status as a "means of fun". Mech Engineer is a game with an attitude problem, frankly. I realised this on in-game day two, when the interface coughed up a bunch of damage reports presented as pieces of paper, which I then had to crumple up and toss away individually.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[XDefiant is Ubisoft's attempt at creating a Call of Duty killer, but the company has so much more locked away in its IP vault. That's why it should be no surprise that a leaker has discovered mentions of maps themed around Assassin's Creed. 


CoD is well-known for its weird and wacky crossovers these days, so it's not a huge shock that XDefiant aims to follow that pattern too. It's easier when you own a lot of IP as well, as Ubisoft does, so getting them into your game is much easier and doesn't require negotiations with the rights owners. 


According to Rogue, an XDefiant dataminer, two Assassin's Creed maps should appear in the game at some point in the future, with the leaker posting a clip featuring sounds from the maps, while also stating that they had found a "good amount of things related to" the locations. 




It would definitely be interesting to see what those maps would look like, with all of the Assassin's Creed maps set well in the past. Whether we would see locations from history or maps based on the more modern-day story that is expected to feature in Assassin's Creed: Infinity. Other leaks have suggested that a new faction called The Brotherhood could also be linked to the long-running series.


Of course, it's worth remembering that these are leaks and rumors, and haven't been confirmed by Ubisoft. Therefore, it's worth taking all of this information with a pinch of salt until we get official word from the developers. Still, it's hard not to let your imagination run wild at the thought.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dwarven co-op caper Deep Rock Galactic has spent years raising the stakes. Where its offworld mining concern once dealt merely with steep drops and irate bugs, it’s since had to face down the robotic army of a rival mineral corp and an omnicidal alien plague. If the subsequent question is "It used to be about the rocks, y'know?" then DRG’s imminent Season 5 update, Drilling Deeper, is the answer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Amazon will air a live-action TV series based on Sega's Yakuza games in October this year, says the streaming service. Like A Dragon: Yakuza will be a six-part series following characters in the criminal underbelly of Kamurocho, set to straddle between two time periods: 1995 and 2005. The series "showcases modern Japan and the dramatic stories of these intense characters, such as the legendary Kazuma Kiryu, that games in the past have not been able to explore,” said Amazon, who are releasing it through Prime Video, just like their Fallout series.

If you've been longing for an official remake of the original Legend of Zelda on the NES, then chances are you'll have a pretty hefty wait on your hands. Thankfully, then, you can at least assuage your pain by checking out the latest gameplay video of an unofficial remake from fan Lloyd Empty (thanks, Wccftech). It's been up for a little while at this point, but hey, it's never too late to highlight excellent projects like this.
Clocking in at just over 20 minutes, the video showcases the game from the beginning, albeit with some interesting alterations to the structure and dialogue. Link will no longer receive a sword from the Old Man; instead, you need to venture into the basement and solve some simple puzzles before you can get yourself equipped.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When you think of shooting accurately with a sniper rifle, you automatically think about scoping in, steadying your scope, and firing. If you use this Warzone attachment, however, you can hit perfect shots without aiming down the sight of your Kar98kn. 


As shown in a video by SkillIssue-- on Reddit, adding the CS15 Scarlet Box Laser to your Kar98k makes it incredibly accurate when hipfiring, downing enemies with one shot even at long range. 




Unfortunately, this does come with a little bit of a catch, as you need to be standing completely still to get the incredible advantage that this attachment provides. Still, if you can take the time to stop and line up your shot, it will hit it with mindboggling accuracy and could be very, very useful. 


Of course, the downside to standing still is that you're an easier target to hit, as a moving target requires good aim and some tracking. In this case, just make sure you get your shot off first, and you should be ok. 


This news comes off the back of the revelation that the Crossbow is not a one-shot down anywhere on the body, making it incredibly powerful too. With this pair of one-shot weapons, you may find yourself dropping a lot more often than you were before. We've included SkillIssue's Kar98k loadout below, and you can also check out our Crossbow loadout if you fancy trying it out.

Considering how much the Fallout franchise has evolved over the years, the original game is still a darn good time and well worth checking out. You can play it on Steam now for under a tenner, if you like, but one fan has gone a step further and ported the game over to the 3DS.
As spotted by TheGamer, the mod was created by MrHuu with details posted on GBATemp. You'll need to own a legal copy of the original game to migrate the relevant files over to the 3DS (which, of course, needs to be modded), but overall, it sounds like a relatively painless way to play the game on something that isn't the Steam Deck.

How to counter Vecna


The best way to counter Vecna is to utilize the Magic Items that spawn in chests specifically when Vecna is the chosen killer. The chests regenerate as the round goes on, allowing you to replenish up to two Magic Items that are great counters to Vecna. You can see the chests glowing with a white aura when they have a Magic Item in them.

The former Call of Duty world champion is no stranger to dominating FPS titles, and he has an inside scoop on which weapons perform best.

        <updated>2024-06-03T21:38:36.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rumors alleged that XDefiant movement mechanics could be hindered in Season 1, but Ubisoft's Mark Rubin quickly stepped in and put those claims to bed. 


Landon Apollo claimed that mid-air directional movement and strafing would be removed from XDefiant Season 1, along with a nerf to bunny hopping. Rubin responded, "I'm pretty sure that's not true. And I know a guy on the inside." 




That isn't to say there won't aren't any movement changes coming down the pipeline. XDefiant developer ACHES confirmed that the team intends to punish players for repeated jumps and crouches by adding aiming sway. Ubisoft doesn't want to restrict players from using any of the free-to-play shooters' mechanics, but ACHES argued that there is a sweet spot between intended use and spam. As for when this update will go live, On May 25, the XDefiant developer reassured fans that the update would be added in soon. 


If players had a chance to play the XDefiant close beta in 2023, they would have had an opportunity to see the aim sway penalty in action. If a player jumped consecutively too many times in a row, their weapon would shake back and forth, making it hard to quickly line up a shot on an enemy. So even though there won't be any substantial movement changes coming, players will have to readjust their plans once this patch goes out. Currently, most players like to use their momentum from a slide into a jump to catch an enemy off guard. Once jumping gets nerfed, players will have to be more cautious about the movement feature and pick their spots with more intent. 


Movement speed is always a contentious topic in FPS titles, and there will inevitably be a frustrated segment of the player base, regardless of how much of a difference this impending change makes. But if you are sick of getting killed by enemies jumping around you, there is at least a little bit of relief coming, even if it isn't wide-sweeping.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We finally have a preview of the newest character coming to Genshin Impact: Emilie, a perfumist from Fontaine. Here’s everything we know about Emilie so far, from her element to her backstory.


Emilie’s element and details


Emilie is a Dendro character from Fontaine. Her Vision shape tells us that she has a Pneuma alignment. We can’t see her weapon or rarity from her character art, so we’ll have to wait for her kit details before we find out.


Emilie’s Constellation is called Pomum de Ambra, which is Latin for “apple of amber.” This is another name for pomanders – accessories used during the Middle Ages and Renaissance for carrying perfumes.


As a perfumist, Emilie creates a dazzling variety of perfumes for Fontanians to wear. According to Neuvillette, these scents aren’t purely for aesthetics. Some of them have aroma-therapeutic properties and can help regulate mood.


Oddly enough, Emilie’s drip marketing preview also includes mention of a “forensic cleaner.” It’s unclear if Emilie is actually a forensic cleaner as well as a perfumist. It may simply be a reference to how Emilie helps eradicate bad smells by covering them up with pleasant ones.


While we haven’t met Emilie before in Genshin Impact, she’s been mentioned in the past. Lyney, Lynette, and Wriothesley have voice lines about Emilie, and Chevreuse has mentioned being friends with Emilie during previous in-game events.

When is Emilie coming to Genshin Impact?


Given the timing of her announcement, we can expect Emilie to make her debut during Genshin Impact Version 4.8. If Genshin’s current update schedule holds, Version 4.8 should drop on July 17, with more character information being revealed in the weeks leading up to that date.


While we patiently wait for Emilie, Version 4.7 has plenty of new characters and events to keep us occupied, including a brand new game mode.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fortuna is one of the free-roam NPC hubs in Warframe where you are introduced to the Solaris United, Vox Solaris, and Ventkids Syndicates. It’s also where you will have access to the huge Orb Vallis open world. 


Bosses, bounties, races, and so many other explorable areas of this map are yet to be encountered. But in this case, if you are trying to get there, here’s how.


Where is Fortuna in Warframe?


Fortuna is located on the planet Venus. You’ll first have to progress through the planet going south until you get to the Venus Junction. 


To access the Venus Junction, you must do the following:



Complete the Vor’s Prize quest


Complete Saya’s Vigil


Use the Fusion system to rank up any mod

Do this by using the Endo collected into your mission. Go to your mod console across from the foundry and select any mod. Select Fusion and start upgrading.





Screenshot by Destructoid


Once these conditions have been met, defeat the Volt Specter who awaits you in a battle. Upon defeating him, you will now be able to access Venus.


Just complete the E. Gate and Unda missions to get to Fortuna. Upon unlocking the node, you can access the hub with most of the NPCs available to talk to. As you progress more into the quest line, increase your standing with the people there, and unlock the tougher content, everything will eventually become available.


If you are still early on into your questing and progressing through the Star Chart in Warframe, you may not be able to beat the higher bounty levels as they are multi-staged and present you with harder enemies. In that case, you can revisit this area once you have a build that can help out.

Fischl, Beidou, and Yae Miko are good offensive picks, while Kuki Shinobu makes for a good healer. Pick one or two Electro teammates to complement Alhaitham.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the trickier dailies to get in Warframe is to suspend 5 enemies in the air with a heavy slam melee attack. Since it’s not as easy as getting a collateral kill with something like an ability or AoE weapon, what’s the trick? We can help you get this below.


How to easily suspend 5 enemies in the air with a heavy slam attack in Warframe


You can do this challenge with most melee weapons in the game, but some make it easier than others. Typically, heavy weapons like hammers and heavy blades have larger heavy slam attack radiuses. 


You’ll also want to play missions that have high enemy density so there’s a higher likelihood of getting this challenge done easily. Here’s a list of missions with high enemy density:



Lua - Tycho


Lua - Yuvarium


Lua - Circulus 


Uranus - Ophelia


Sedna - Adaro


Deimos - Terrorem


Deimos - Persto


Deimos - Testudo



To make things even easier, you want to use frame abilities that can group enemies together. Using frames like Khora, Mag, Nidus, or Vauban can make this challenge trivial. 


If you do not have access to these frames, there are a lot of melee weapons with exceptional slam radiuses.

Best melee weapons to suspend 5 enemies with a heavy slam attack


These are the best melee weapons to use to suspend five enemies with a heavy slam attack. They have the largest slam radius and can pair very well with grouping abilities.



Arca Titron


Kuva Shildeg


Magistar


Fragor


Sibear


Ekhein


Fragor Prime


Heliocor


Synoid Heliocor


Jat Kittag


Volnus


Wolf Sledge


Sancti Magistar


Masseter


Masseter Prime


Volnus Prime



Out of all of these weapons, the Volnus Prime has the largest heavy slam radius, making it the best of the bunch. The others will do just as fine, even those that aren’t on the list.

How to use Swap Cancelling in Wuthering Waves


Swap Cancelling is the act of performing an attack with one character, then immediately swapping to another, mid-animation, so that the first character's attack still fully executes. This sequence can be performed on almost any attack in the game, though the best use of it is during ones with long animations. There are a few reasons with incredible benefits for performing successful swap cancels.

Based on the Destiny Server and Update Status page, Destiny 2 will be offline until June 4 at 10 a.m. PT/12 p.m. CT/1 p.m. ET. That means the server downtime will last around 24 hours, starting on June 3 at 9 a.m. PT.

During this time, Destiny 2 players won't be able to log in or participate in activities. An ongoing Destiny maintenance period will also last for a few more hours, ending around 12 p.m. PT on June 4. You'll still be able to play the game two hours prior, but you may encounter some sign-on issues until the maintenance has concluded. In this case, players may be placed in a queue while it is active.


Once Destiny 2's downtime is up, players can expect the launch of The Final Shape. The DLC drops at the same time and features a new campaign with an immeasurable number of unique challenges. Pre-loads are available, but be wary of its hefty storage space of more than 100 GB. Considering the size, it's best to prepare during the downtime, just so you're ready for launch.

You can also add a touch of genius to your midfield lineup by completing his SBC before it expires from Ultimate Team. 


What are the EA FC 24 Thiago Alcantara Flashback SBC tasks?


Tonight's Flashback SBC could be the perfect one for beginners to complete, as EA Sports has included only three tasks. All three of them have different conditions that will need to be fulfilled while submitting the squads.

With an IP that is familiar to people of all ages, beginners can focus on learning basic TCG mechanics and spend less time figuring out how to pronounce an ancient demon warlord’s middle name. 


Your first Lorcana purchase typically comes down to two options. Purchasing a starter deck allows you to jump into a game with a predetermined strategy and decklist. But if the starter decks available don’t resonate with you, you can buy a booster box and immediately have access to a large collection to build your own deck with. This guide will focus on booster boxes and tell you everything you need to know about this product.

WayForward Technologies has worked on several well-known franchises over the years, including the likes of Contra, Silent Hill, The Mummy, Transformers, and even Aliens. Despite this, the reveal that the developer would collaborate with Atari on a brand new Yars entry came as a genuine shock to many, this writer included.
Not only is Yars' Revenge one of the most beloved Atari 2600 games of the early '80s, but the game, along with its sequels, is fundamentally an arcade shooter. So when WayForward introduced Yars Rising as a Metroidvania starring charismatic hacker Emi Kimura, you'd be forgiven for raising an eyebrow. How could such a drastic departure from the original possibly work? Would snippets of classic Yars gameplay sprinkled throughout the experience be enough to satisfy old-school fans?

Now, Meridia has imploded and become a radiant, wailing, purple-fringed disc of pure nothingness, with triumphant players rudely ejected from orbit via emergency hyperspace jump, but subsequently allowed to return and gaze into the dark heart of their victory. Great work, Inferno-plungers. I'm sure the consequences of this will be neither cosmic nor horrible.

Dire Decks was released in 2023 on itch.io and was well received there. Kindanice has pointed out the direct likeness between their game and the one released on Steam under another name. Yikes. Thanks to our diligent commenters for catching this. We'll try to find out more. 
Original article: The onslaught of fun Steam Next Fest demos you can play right now continues and will not relent. Card Bard is a deckbuilding roguelike shooter in which your wee gunman is seemingly frozen in abject terror as little pill-shaped baddies creep towards him like bacteria on a petri dish. Good thing you have a hand of cards, each one showing how many bullets will bop forth from your body when you select it. It's surprisingly tough for something so pastel-paletted. I'm 10th on the leaderboard. You can probably beat that, right?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In EA's Desert Strike - released way back in the dim salvages of 1992 - you are a helicopter pilot scooting around a Sylvester Stallone reinvention of Iraq, shooting down tanks and fighters with guns and missiles while rescuing VIPs and fretting constantly about your wafer-thin armour and espresso-sized fuel reserves. It was a no-frills piece of Gulf War fanfic, complete with George Bush ending cameo, and a well-made shooter that used to drive me nuts on Sega Mega Drive.
Megacopter: Blades Of The Goddess is Desert Strike, but heavily Blood-Dragonified and with a big dollop of Airwolf to boot. Here, the enemy troops are naughty Reptoid aliens, the writing is scattershot-satirical (upgrades are bought with pizza tokens) and your helicopter houses the soul of a blood-drinking "AZ-TECH" goddess. Is it a nuanced parody of the Strike series? It doesn't feel like it. Did I enjoy the demo? Yes. Does it have a crawling tentacle boss called Queen Oildusa? Also yes, and will you please stop asking questions so I can write the rest of this article.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s been a while since we last got an update on Metal Slug Tactics, the turn-based strategy spin-off of the popular side-scrolling shoot 'em up. The game was first announced during the online-only E3 2021 and has suffered a few delays since then with minimal updates. After a long wait, the game has finally reemerged with a new trailer and a fall 2024 launch window.
The new video shows off the game's spin on tactics, with long-time stars Marco, Eri, Fio, and Tarma taking literal turns obliterating the opposition. The game sees players building squads of classic Metal Slug characters, each with unique loadouts of recognizable series weapons, to take on signature villains and bosses, like the warship in the video.


Metal Slug Tactics is developed by Leikir Studio and is published by Dotemu, the team behind TMNT: Shredder's Revenge. Famed composer Tee Lopes (Shredder's Revenge, Sonic Mania) is developing the game's soundtrack. 
When first revealed, Metal Slug Tactics was only slated to launch for Switch and PC. Today's trailer confirms that it's also coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Kena: Bridge of Spirits is making the leap to Xbox in August. The 2021 action-adventure game has been available only on PlayStation and PC, and its move to Microsoft’s platform comes with some new in-game goodies.
As the debut title by Ember Lab, this story-driven action game stars Kena, a young spirit guide who must unravel the mystery of a destroyed village by helping lost souls move on to the afterlife. She’s assisted by the Rot, tiny, adorable spirits Kena can command to aid in puzzle-solving and combat. The game’s design draws inspiration from series such as The Legend of Zelda, while combat has shades of From Software’s Dark Souls. 
Kena hits Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One on August 15 for $39.99 and will include exclusive pirate-themed Rot hats, a Golden Rot skin, and a unique staff for Kena. A new physical premium edition will also be available and will consist of these items, a digital soundtrack, and an exclusive sticker sheet. The Xbox version also includes the Anniversary DLC update, which includes the Spirit Guide Trials, additional Kena outfits, and New Game+


We awarded Kena: Bridge of Spirits a 9 out of 10, with former editor-in-chief Andrew Reiner writing in his review, "Bridge of Spirits stumbles a little in spots, yet confidently sprints into the heart of the adventure, rewarding the player with secrets galore and visuals that are almost always worth admiring. If you love Zelda-like games or are just looking for an experience that will make you smile every step of the way, you can’t go wrong with Kena: Bridge of Spirits." The game was also a sales success, recouping its development costs a month after its initial release in September 2021.

Summer Game Fest has emerged as a hub for a lot of developers seeking eyes. The 2-hour show hosted by marketing man Geoff Keighley will be broadcasting on Friday, blasting you in the ocular nerves with, probably, a lot of games. However, most of these games will not be brand new, exciting reveals, said Keighley himself in a fresh Twitch Q & A. "There will be, definitely, new announcements," he said, "but the show is largely focused on, I think, existing games that have new updates for fans." He's mentioning this ahead of time, he said, to set expectations.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This year's Summer Game Fest showcase is happening this week, on Friday, June 7, at 2 p.m. PT/5 p.m. ET, and with more than 55 studios and publishers set to be featured at the event (including Play Days this weekend) this year, fans have been speculating on what they might see. That includes Kingdom Hearts fans, who have been hoping to see something related to Kingdom Hearts IV at SGF this year, given it's been more than two years since its reveal. 
However, SGF host and creator Geoff Keighley thinks Kingdom Hearts fans should lower their expectations for the show. 
"People keep asking about Kingdom Hearts, I don't know why," Keighley says during a recent stream where he answered questions about SGF. "I think it's because we did [Final Fantasy VII Rebirth] last year or something like that. But yeah, people are setting themselves up for failure but you guys can keep hoping." 
Here's a clip of it, too: 
😭 pic.twitter.com/CPoIy0zrOh
June 3, 2024
Now, Keighley could be playing coy, especially with the "but you guys can keep hoping" part at the end, but it's more likely that he's trying to nicely let Kingdom Hearts fans know that if they expect to see Kingdom Hearts IV during SGF, they might be disappointed. 
In the meantime, watch the Kingdom Hearts IV reveal trailer, and then read Game Informer's exclusive interview with Tetsuya Nomura about Kingdom Hearts IV, the series' future with Final Fantasy, and more. 
Do you think we'll hear about Kingdom Hearts IV this upcoming weekend? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

Not just a bottomless pit, but a conveniently portable, Looney Tunes-esque hole into which you could seemingly chuck everything from items and equipment to characters. Speaking to me during the same interview in which they discussed long-abandoned plans for bringing back Baldur’s Gate 1’s Candlekeep, Larian CEO Swen Vincke and Baldur’s Gate 3 lead writer Adam Smith (RPS in peace) touched on the subject with tantalising brevity. Argh, if only I hadn’t had to run off and catch a taxi, I’d still be there now, discussing the many applications of a portable hole. Bypassing carrying capacity limits would just be the start of it.

Instead, Tiny Glade simply offers a meadow and tools with which to build. The vibe of the game is cottage-core at its finest, with enough whimsigoth finery that you'll soon lament that you can't actually live inside your glorious creations.

He goes on to promote the inclusion of diverse stories and characters in games, stating, "If there are people who aren't like you in a game, I want you to know that that game is still for you."

SGF is sort of already in motion - last week, Sony kicked off the proceedings with their latest State of Play showcase, but you can expect the majority of new videogame announcements from Friday 7th June with the Summer Game Fest 2024 Opening Showcase, a two-hour livestreamed event which starts at 10pm UK, 5pm ET and 2pm PT.

Authorities aren't naming the service but if the name TVMucho rings any bells, people are on the right track. That police identified the owner of the service is no surprise. The Dutchman has never hidden away and has continuously claimed his service operates legally. If only in part, it's still streaming channels right now.

Overmorrow, the debut release from solo developer PixelManta, manages to be philosophically interesting, is evocatively written, visually distinct, and lovingly crafted.

A bunch of us have recently returned from trips down to the Brighton office to meet some new faces. Weird to think I'm now the most far-flung of the lot, living way up here in Glasgow. Maybe that's why I elected to take over these Playing This Weekend posts, to help fill the friendless void growing inside my heart.
So just know that if you don't sound off in the comments below with news of what you're playing this weekend, the void in my heart will grow, until one day it consumes me. And then who will write these posts? Here's what we're clicking on this weekend!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time reinvented the series in 3D and became its new gold standard, Nintendo followed up with a surreal sequel in Majora's Mask. Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days. Majora's Mask's unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.
Join Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard today and each Friday on Twitch at 1:00 p.m. CT as they gradually work their way through the entire game until Termina is saved.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Toys for Bob, the developer of Crash Bandicoot 4 and the Skylanders series, has announced a publishing deal with Xbox for its next game. The studio recently went independent after splitting off from its former parent company, Activision Blizzard.
The studio states its new title is "very early in development" and that we won't see it for some time. Whatever this game is, Xbox will be its home, which isn't surprising since the studio teased it was exploring a relationship with the publisher a couple of months ago.
We're excited to announce that we'll be partnering with @Xbox to publish our next new game. We're still very early in development, so you might not hear from us for a bit - but know that we're working hard on an experience we're so sooo inspired about! Can't wait to share more 💜 pic.twitter.com/6EqrQbabpv
May 31, 2024
Toys For Bob went independent in February, a few months after Microsoft acquired Activision Blizzard. The studio is seemingly getting to have its cake and eat it too, since it still gets to work with Xbox while being an autonomous entity. Prior to leaving Activision, Toys For Bob worked on the recent Crash Bandicoot games such as Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time and Crash Team Rumble. It also developed the Spyro Reignited Trilogy and created the once-wildly popular Skylanders series.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I regret not covering Skald Colon Against The Black Priory when its developer told us about it 2019. I'd get to be so smug now.
Skald is terrific. I've tried to come up with a clever angle on its journey, but they all wind up saying the same thing: For all its retro stylings (right down to party portraits taking up an unnecessary quarter of the screen at all times), it's an accessible, charming treat, and the best modernisation of 80s RPGs that I've ever played.

The recent Content Warning has sucked up all the remaining oxygen in the room, and oxygen is pretty important in Murky Divers, for reasons that are hopefully self-evident. Still, Murky Divers has some fairly eye-catching USPs. It's got underwater physics, of course, and it puts you and - unhelpfully - your friends in charge of a submarine.

Retro first-person gunwaltzer Selaco is a messy machine gun dash through an office exploding with glass, concrete, splinters, and sparks. The glock-toting wreckage 'em up first hit our radar when it was announced as a modern combination of F.E.A.R. and Doom, promising both the fiendish AI enemies of the former and the satisfying blasting of the latter. Well, it's out today. Bursting forth into the corporate lobby of early access with uzis akimbo, peppering the walls with angry bullets. Good, I say.

Marvel Rivals is a superhero (specifically Marvel superhero) team-based PVP shooter inspired by games like Overwatch. The footage, seen below, reveals Venom and Adam Warlock are coming to the game. The footage also shows a new location – the Tokyo 2099: Spider-Islands map.
Alongside the new gameplay details, the game is now also confirmed to be coming to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S alongside the previously confirmed PC platform. Developer NetEase is also planning a closed beta for the game in July. PlayStation beta testers will have exclusive access to Spider-Man's Scarlet Spider cosmetic skin.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In Mike Judge’s 1999 cult comedy Office Space, there’s a scene where Ron Livingston’s Peter - a programmer working a tedious corporate job - visits a hypnotist. “Is there any way that you could, sorta, just zonk me out so I don’t know that I’m at work, in here,” Peter asks of the hypnotist, pointing to his head. “Could I come home and think that I’ve been fishing all day, or something?”. That’s basically the high-level concept for brilliant sci-fi comedy show Severance, right there. Not wanting to spoil any more than I absolutely have to, I’ll present you with two facts up top. 1. It features a touching queer relationship between John Turturro and Christopher Walken and 2. It’s some of the best television I’ve seen in the last few years. Throw in some Stanley Parable, Control, Gilliam’s Brazil, and some more meta undertones of general musing on gamified reward loops, and you’ve got Severance.

The game never had a specific release date, but we were admittedly expecting it this year. In a post on the official Little Nightmares III X account, the team shared the message below, writing, "As much as we can't wait for you to return to the Nowhere, we also want to make sure we give the game the care and love it deserves. Quality is a top priority for us, and we know you feel the same way. For this reason, we've made the decision to shift the release of the game to 2025."
Please do bear with us, little ones, for we need a little extra time to prepare your visit.

Notably, Supermassive, the developer behind games like Until Dawn (which is coming to PC and PlayStation 5 soon) did not develop the first two games. Those games were developed by Tarsier Studios, whose next project has not been announced.

Workday malaise is universal, however, whether or not you’re lucky enough to enjoy your job as much as I do.

Sorry, not freegans - freegunners. Freeganism is a portmanteau of "free" and "vegan" referring to people who fish jars of near-spoiled hummus out of supermarket dumpsters according to an ideology of minimal resource consumption. Freegunners, meanwhile, are lairy Guardians Of The Galaxy-alike mercenaries with phat guns and playstyle-defining secondary abilities. They do not consume hummus as far as I know. The game is out 23rd August 2024, with a beta happening in July, and I've got an overview trailer for you below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Per last night’s Sony State of Play, PS5 darling and supposedly rather good action-dad adventure God of War Ragnarök is coming to PC on September 19th 2024. The good news is that the port, co-developed by Jetpack Interactive and original makers Santa Monica Studio, will pack in all the DLSS 3, FSR 3, and ultrawide what-have-yous that one might expect from a big, monied PC release. The bad, silly, clearly pointless news is that it will need a PlayStation Network (PSN) account, despite the complete lack of multiplayer.

Overall, sites are still being blocked in large numbers, but the real growth isn't found on main domains. Easily and quickly deployed at almost no cost, subdomains can circumvent blocking and Spain blocks them in their thousands.

        <updated>2024-05-30T23:35:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you haven’t followed Infinity Nikki, it’s equal parts charming, beautiful, and ambitious. The open-world game is the latest entry in the Nikki series of fashion games, which is very popular in Asia, and Westerners are getting their biggest exposure to it yet with this charming adventure. 


The game unfolds on the magical continent of Miraland, and Nikki must save it. Her main power is "styling," which involves changing clothes from different nations, allowing her to adopt unique abilities. For example, one outfit allows her to float while another cleanses corrupted creatures of demonic energy. The trailer shows one outfit that lets players summon a giant flower to glide through the air. Another ability shrinks her to the size of her small companion, Momo, to access tight areas and other locations. 
The more outfits you collect, the more abilities Nikki has to solve puzzles and overcome platforming obstacles. But despite the "save the world" premise, Infinity Nikki is billed as a relaxing adventure. You can also catch bugs, go fishing, and gather resources to craft new outfits, among other activities. 
Infinity Nikki looks wild, and fans can get their first taste of it in a beta test happening during Q3 of this year. The game is coming to PlayStation 5, PC, iOS, and Android but has no release window.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Survios has released the first look at gameplay in its upcoming VR game, Alien: Rogue Incursion, and it turns out, exploring a seemingly abandoned  facility in VR looks as terrifying as you'd expect.
The trailer aired during today's PlayStation State of Play as the game is coming to PS VR2, but it's also coming to Meta Quest 3 and Steam (for other PC VR devices) this holiday season. In the trailer, we get a few glimpses of some Xenomorphs, the tracking device we'll be using to avoid said Xenomorphs, and a look at some pods that indicate we might be fighting more than one. 
Check it out for yourself in the Alien: Rogue Incursion gameplay trailer below: 


In a new PlayStation Blog post, Survios chief product officer TQ Jefferson explains that Alien: Rogue Incursion was developed from the ground up in Unreal Engine 5. Jefferson also shares that the "high tension shooter" tasks players with exploring an "overrun facility on the inhospitable planet Purdan." 
"Dynamically spawning and pathing with countless unique possibilities, even we couldn't tell you exactly where and when each Xenomorph will strike, let alone what strategies it might use or if it'll bring some friends," the blog post reads. "While heart-pounding combat is the core of Alien: Rogue Incursion, grabbing your pulse rifle and blasting your way out of every situation is not always the best strategy. 
"Constantly hunted by unpredictable and resourceful Xenomorphs, players will often find creativity and a level head to be their greatest weapons, especially when it comes to leveraging the environment to their advantage." 
Alien: Rogue Incursion hits VR this holiday season.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Until Dawn, the 2015 horror adventure game from Supermassive Games, is coming to PlayStation 5 and PC in remake form this fall. We received a new trailer for the beloved game alongside the announcement during today's State of Play presentation. 
Until Dawn puts you in control of eight teenagers/young adults who venture up a mountain for a fun night in a secluded cabin. In typical slasher-movie fashion, there is much more than meets the eye regarding this cabin and its surrounding area. Relying heavily on player choice, Until Dawn's narrative uses a system called the Butterfly Effect, where pivotal choices you make have consequences that go far beyond that which you can immediately recognize. The game stars actors like Rami Malek, Hayden Panettiere, Meaghan Martin, and more.


Originally announced as a full remake of the game, the trailer footage does not appear to be a significant step up in terms of visuals, appearing to be more in line with the industry's definition of a remaster. PlayStation's official description says it's been "rebuilt and enhanced for PS5 consoles and PC." Developed by Ballistic Moon, this improved version also boasts new environments, collectibles, and re-cut narrative sequences. 
We loved Until Dawn when it arrived on PlayStation 4 in 2015, awarding it a score of 9 out of 10. In the time since Until Dawn's original release, Supermassive has released other games in the genre, including The Dark Pictures Anthology and The Quarry. The studio is currently working on The Casting of Frank Stone, a game set in the Dead by Daylight universe. Until Dawn arrives on PlayStation 5 and PC this fall.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s been a long time since we wrote about a new Dynasty Warriors game, but that changes today with the announcement of Dynasty Warriors: Origins, the new release from Koei Tecmo’s Omega Force studio, a team long known for work on the venerable franchise.
The games have an unusual identity and are, in some ways, a genre unto themselves. They almost always feature large-scale battles in which the lead character can sweep through dozens of enemy combatants with a single swing.
That playstyle appears to remain intact if this new trailer is to be believed.
A lot has changed in action gameplay in the years since Dynasty Warriors was at its most popular, but there’s no doubt that the series once had an enthusiastic fanbase.
We’ll see if the series is able to update its gameplay and draw in new fans when it hits PlayStation 5 next year.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today's State of Play concluded with the reveal of a new Astro Bot game. Unlike the last entry, Astro's Playroom, which was a PS5 launch title and a glorified (but very fun) tech demo for the console, this new game is a full-fledged platforming adventure. It's also got an easy-to-remember name: Astro Bot. 
The trailer sees Astro Bot soaring through the galaxy on a Dual Sense-shaped spaceship to explore a variety of vibrant platforming stages set to a smile-inducing soundtrack. He also shows off new abilities like donning gloves that fire springs to grab and swing enemies, soaking water like a sponge to grow gigantic, and, best of all, just a random Parappa the Rappa reference (among other PlayStation franchises). It looks delightful, and we want to play it. 


A PlayStation Blog post also states the game features over 80 levels across 6 galaxies, 20 new abilities, and 70 new enemy types. Astro Bot will be available on PlayStation 5 on September 6. Our review of Astro's Playroom can be found here.]]></summary>

In this trailer, we watch a monster hunter ride through a treacherous sandstorm on the back of a mount before starting a fight with a lion-like bear creature, and as you might expect, it looks great. 
We then watch our hunter fight a rocky toad monster in a cavernous canyon area before three buffalo-esque monsters join the fight. If you've played a Monster Hunter before, you have a good idea of what Wilds looks like – big, flashy, and exciting. 
Check it out for yourself in the Monster Hunter Wilds trailer below: 


This is our first look at Monster Hunter Wilds since its reveal at The Game Awards 2023 last December. Those with Monster Hunter World and Monster Hunter World: Iceborne save date will get exclusive in-game rewards. The trailer also reiterates that Monster Hunter Wild hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC in 2025.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlayStation has announced it is bringing its 2022 hit PlayStation-exclusive game, God of War Ragnarök, to PC. It revealed this during today's State of Play with a new trailer alongside a September 19 release date. 
This follows PlayStation's recent trend of bringing its single-player, narrative-driven games over to PC years after they first launch on PlayStation. Just this month, it brought Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut to PC, and today, PlayStation CEO Hermen Hulst revealed all live-service games will launch day-and-date on PS5 and PC while "tentpole" single-player games will launch at later dates on PC. 
As you might expect, the PC version of God of War Ragnarök will feature unlocked frame rates, Nvidia DLSS 3.7. (and AMD FSR 3.1 and Intel XESS 1.3), super ultrawide support, and other PC features. This version of Ragnarök will feature the free Valhalla DLC from last year, too, and pre-purchasing the game gets you in-game rewards like the Kratos Risen Snow Armor and Atreus Risen Snow Tunic. 
Check it out for yourself below in the God of War Ragnarök PC reveal trailer: 


According to the game's Steam listing, it will require a PlayStation Network account. 
God of War Ragnarök hits PC on September 19, 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today’s State of Play revealed a new fantasy action game called Ballad of Antara. The trailer shows all manner of over-the-top stylish combat against supernatural foes. However, the hero does all of this while carrying a small child on his back.


Ballad of Antara is billed as an Unreal Engine 5 single-player, free-to-play action RPG starring multiple characters called Emissaries. Each of these characters sports their own class and abilities, as well as a unique story. Players will travel between two worlds seeking out these Emissaries to strengthen your force, but the young girl being carried around is the apparently the key to salvation. A PlayStation Blog post on the game describes your duty to her as such: "You will help her undo the devastation done to this desolate world through trials, twists, and confrontation, and witness her growth along the way."
In addition to a single-player story, the game lets up to three players explore together in multiplayer, whether they be close buddies or total strangers wandering the game alongside you. Developer Tipworks also states plans to continually update Ballad of Antara post-launch with new zones, story content, and Emissaries. 
Ballad of Antara is coming to PS5, PC, and mobile platforms in 2025.]]></summary>

        <id>122715</id>
        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/state-of-play/2024/05/30/playstation-reveals-first-look-at-concords-5v5-fps-gameplay-out-this"/>
        <updated>2024-05-30T22:03:24.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlayStation has formally revealed Concord, the first game from Firewalk Studios, which it acquired in 2023, and it brings a healthy (and comedic dose) of sci-fi to the console's 2024 lineup. Concord is both the start of a new sci-fi IP for PlayStation and a five-versus-five-player multiplayer shooter coming to PlayStation 5 and PC this year. 
Before showcasing some third-person shooter gameplay, a vignette setting up the game's world and tone played, and it's here we get a look at its Guardians of the Galaxy-esque action. We see several characters who appear to make up the rag-tag group of heroes we'll be controlling, each with seemingly unique abilities, attempting to capture a special device from someone attempting to escape a rundown locale called Crater City. 
Check it out for yourself in the Concord cinematic reveal below: 


After this vignette, PlayStation showcased our first look at Concord's gameplay. We get a look at Vale, a sniper, Lennox, a cowboy-esque revolver shooter, Haymar, who uses a magical bow and arrow, Star Child, a brutish shotgun user, and 1-Off, a support character who appears to use support-type elemental moves. The gameplay looks reminiscent of Destiny 2's PvP modes, although brighter in color and more fantastical in visual design. 
Check out the Concord gameplay reveal for yourself below:


After the gameplay, some of the Firewalk developers spoke about what players can expect, including deployable gear that can exist throughout a full game (across multiple rounds) and asymmetrical match-ups between players. While the gameplay only showcased five characters, a quick look at the game's roster revealed several more. 
Firewalk says every week when you log on to Concord, you'll be treated to a short cutscene vignette teaching you more about the characters. 
Firewalk and PlayStation will hold a beta on PS5 and PC this July before the game's simultaneous launch on those platforms on August 23, 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Revealed during The Game Awards 2023 last December, The First Descendant is an upcoming looter-shooter RPG from Nexon and one of the South Korean company's first forays into the console market space. Due out this year, this free-to-play third-person multiplayer shooter is hoping to attract players within the Destiny 2 and Warframe community and newcomers alike. And after playing the game for a couple of hours, we're inclined to believe Nexon is on to something here. 
Ahead of the game's release, Game Informer editor Wesley LeBlanc traveled to Seoul, South Korea, to visit Nexon and speak to some of The First Descendant's leads about what players can expect, its plans for the game after launch, and more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero’s latest trailer has unveiled fusion warriors for its roster. It also seems to tease another announcement on the horizon.
The trailer reveals the additions of Gotenks (the fusion of Goten and Trunks), Kefla (the fusion of Caulifla and Kale), Fused Zamasu, and Goku and Vegeta’s fusions, Vegito and Gogeta. Watch them trade blows in the trailer below: 


Since each fusion includes the fighters that make them up and their various transformations, the full list of characters joining the roster amounts to 21. Check them out below. 
Trunks (Kid)

The trailer ends with a message serving as a classic callback to the anime that states, “Next time on Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero: Summer Game Fest 2024.” Could we be getting a release date at Geoff Keighley’s showcase? Given that the game was revealed during another Keighley show, The Game Awards 2023, it wouldn’t be surprising.
Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero is the next entry in what’s known in the West as the Budokai Tenkaichi series (Sparking is the franchise's original Japanese name). The roster is only halfway revealed, but we’ve already seen a number of confirmed fighters from Dragon Ball Z and Dragon Ball Super, including multiple versions of the same characters. The game has no release window but is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. You can learn more about the game's new mechanics and features here.]]></summary>

And I know why. Bellwright has taught me what I already knew in theory, but had not truly appreciated:

Games inspired by The Legend of Zelda are common; after all, the long-running Nintendo franchise is among the most influential series in gaming history. Because of this, various games take the Zelda format and try to replicate it, but these homages often miss out on the magic that makes that series greater than the sum of its parts. This is particularly true in the indie space, with Zelda-inspired titles a dime a dozen, making it difficult to stand out from the crowd. Minishoot' Adventures clearly draws inspiration from Zelda – specifically A Link to the Past – but by applying…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlayStation has reiterated its approach to releasing its games on PC, stating live-service games will launch day-and-date on PC. However, its tentpole single player games will not. 
This comes from one of PlayStation's dual CEOs, Hermen Hulst, during a public business presentation held earlier this morning. During it, Hulst explained the strategy for releasing PlayStation's single-player games on PC at a later date, rather than day-and-date, citing it's part of a strategy to bring more people into the PlayStation platform. 


"Indeed, we are bringing our titles to the PC platform, and we have a dual approach here," Hulst said. "On the live service side, we are releasing our titles simultaneously, so day and date on PlayStation 5 and PC. But with our tentpole titles, our single player narra…]]></summary>

I still think it's a silly name, but with frantic flowing action this immediately gratifying, you can call yourself whatever your killy little heart so desires. For this knight is not like other knights: this is a knight who kills. Wait, they all do that? Oh. Well, this one has four guns. Suck it, literally every other knight.

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/05/30/playstation-5-generation-is-already-sonys-most-profitable-yet"/>
        <updated>2024-05-30T13:42:08.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The PlayStation 5 generation is already Sony's most profitable yet, the company has announced. In terms of numbers, the PS5 generation has already earned Sony $106 billion, according to a slide from its "Game & Network Services Segment" presentation from PlayStation's two new CEOs, Hideaki Nishino and Hermen Hulst. 
However, on that same slide, Sony shows that the PlayStation 4 generation earned $107 billion, which is obviously more than $106 billion. But, the reason Sony is calling the PS5 generation the most profitable one yet is because the PS4 generation is largely complete whereas the PS5 presumably still has years to go. Given it's made $106 billion in roughly four years, it seems Sony is confident it will surpass $107 billion in the coming months or years. 
As for what Sony is including in its profits, it's the entire gamut of the PS5 generation. This includes the PS5 console itself, associated hardware and accessories, and software, too. It also includes services, like PlayStation Plus, according to the presentation. 
One of the reasons the PS5 generation might be Sony's most profitable yet is because even though the playerbase is as big as the PS4 – both are sitting at 49 million active consoles as of last month – PS5 players are playing significantly more on their console. The PS5 generation sits at 2.4 billion total gameplay hours while the PS4 sits at 1.4 billon. More playtime likely equates to more spending, which might be one of the reasons the PS5 generation is doing financially as well as it is. 
Life-to-date spending on the PS5 is also higher amongst players than the PS4, too. Across peripherals, services, content/add-ons, and content/full games, the PS4 life-to-date spend is $580 while PS5 players average $731.

This isn't the first time the over-the-top explode 'em up has been in line to get the big screen treatment. Another version spent years in development hell until the rights lapsed. But it's been picked up again by Universal, who are no strangers to turning video games into box office burger bucks (they did The Super Mario Bros. Movie). So, it might result in an actual movie this time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Netflix has announced a partnership with Mojang Studios to create a new animated series based on Minecraft. The news comes as part of a celebration of Minecraft’s 15th anniversary.
WildBrain, the studio behind other Netflix shows such as Sonic Prime, Ninjago: Dragons Rising, and Carmen Sandiego, is developing this CG-animated Minecraft show. Plot details are nonexistent, but a press release states the series will be "showing the world of Minecraft in a new light" and feature an original story with new characters.


This won't be the only on-screen adaptation of the best-selling video game of all time. A live-action Minecraft movie is currently in production, with Jack Black confirmed to star as Steve.  
The Minecraft show, whatever it winds up being titled, has no premiere date. In the meantime, be sure to catch up on the other video game adaptations Netflix has on the way, including the first teaser for Season 4 of The Witcher (now starring Liam Hemsworth), the first trailer for Arcane Season 2, and the first look at the animated Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft starring Hayley Atwell.]]></summary>

I’ve given it a whirl, and its pretty froggin’ delightful. The game has you progress through different scenes set in a chill, colorful townscape. You can switch at any time between boy and frog. The boy can go anywhere, but is frequently blocked by environmental puzzles. The frog has the means to solve such puzzles, by hopping between shadows naturally cast by the environment. They act like little inky puddles, and simply jumping from one to the other is a rare joy.

Last week, players of the character action gacha asked for more freedom to skip story scenes and dialogue. Having sunk a bunch of hours into the game, I can see why. The combat may be swish and the traversal across its rolling landscape flowing and carefree, but the lore-obsessed babble of its characters is mind-numbing. Wuthering Waves has been this month's lightning rod for hype. But it's worth dissecting what it's actually like to play.

To call something both counterintuitive and fun seems, well, counterintuitive. But also: fun. Which, as a concept is very fun to think about. But, also, quite counterintuitive. Writing such a incredibly redundant paragraph is quite fun, even though I’m just repeating myself. Counterintuitive, right? I’m going to try to escape this paragraph now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With an effectively infinite universe to fill in No Man’s Sky, developers Hello Games have certainly risen to the challenge of trying to fill it with as much stuff as they possibly can over the last near-decade, still managing to add major new features and modes eight years on from the sci-fi exploration game’s release. Next update Adrift is taking things right the way back, though, by emptying the expansive cosmos of almost everything except you, your ship and planets to visit.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mortal Kombat 1’s next superpowered guest fighter, The Boys’ Homelander, shows off his dominance in a new gameplay trailer. The less-than-heroic superhero becomes available for Kombat Pack owners on June 4 and for everyone else on June 11.
The patriotic and maniacal leader of The Seven shows no quarter to his new MK adversaries, obliterating them with an offensive style that is very reminiscent of Superman’s playstyle in the Injustice series. The trailer also shows off the new DLC Kameo fighter Ferra, the smaller, more feral half of the Ferra & Torr team from Mortal Kombat X, who also joins the game sometime in June. 


Homelander joins Peacemaker, Invincible’s Omni-Man, Ermac, Quan-Chi, and the upcoming Takeda in the Year 1 DLC roster. Mortal Kombat 1 also has a story expansion on the way, but there’s still no word on what that will entail or when it will arrive.

XDefiant’s core modes offer temporarily fun stabs at the competitive multiplayer arena shooter, but Ubisoft’s latest attempt at carving out a slice of the lucrative esports pie feels half-baked. Core modes like its practice mode and ranked queue are gated off by construction tape at the time of writing. This leaves a bland battle pass with head-scratching progression decisions and standard weapon-based leveling systems as the only tangible means of rewarding you for playing the game or doing well beyond an individual match.

Lively tactics Trash Of The Titans does not aim to emancipate its villainous vermin. But, like Warhammer, it gets a pass for its evident affection towards its antagonistic dumpster diving scuttlers.

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/exclusive/2024/05/29/hive-jump-2-survivors-premieres-new-trailer-to-coincide-with-early-access"/>
        <updated>2024-05-29T15:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hive Jump 2: Survivors arrives in Steam Early Access today. To celebrate, publisher Midwest Games and developer Graphite Lab have shared an exclusive trailer for the Survivors-like sequel. The first Hive Jump caught our eye way back in 2015 when we named it one of the most promising indie titles on display at PAX West that year before its launch in 2017. The original Hive Jump served as a four-player co-op homage to Super Metroid, but Hive Jump 2: Survivors takes inspiration from a different title: Vampire Survivors.
The genre, called "bullet heaven," puts players in the shoes of a single character who eventually builds up to become extremely powerful as the waves of enemies grow more intense. Hive Jump 2: Survivors carries forward the look of its Metroidvania predecessor but from the genre-standard top-down perspective. You take control of a lone survivor of an alien attack who must now face seemingly insurmountable odds to survive. You can customize your loadout and upgrade your jetpack to destroy enemies and escape tough situations.
The jetpack also allows you to traverse the levels in ways not available in Vampire Survivors. The Jumpers have specific builds that allow you to cater to your play style, which combines with the upgrades you select before each run. You can play with auto-assist aiming or switch to manual controls. If you can survive 14 rounds, you can challenge big boss battles. As you collect goo from fallen enemies, you can earn better weapons, upgrades, and relics to improve your odds. Meanwhile, amber you find in the field can be traded for permanent upgrades to stats, magnets for auto-scavenging, or even screen-wiping nukes.
You can see an exclusive look at the Early Access launch trailer below.


Hive Jump 2: Survivors launches into Steam Early Access today. For more on the work produced by Graphite Lab, check out our review of their 2023 2D platformer, Mr. Run and Jump, here.]]></summary>

Sony has no additional details, but Some PlayStation Studios developers we have not heard from in awhile include Asobi (Astro's Playroom), Bend Studio (Days Gone), Bluepoint (Demon's Souls remake) , Guerrilla (Horizon Zero Dawn), Housemarque (Returnal), Insomniac Games (Spider-Man), Naughty Dog (The Last of Us), Santa Monica Studio (God of War), and Sucker Punch (Ghost of Tsushima). There are more, but those are arguably the developers gamers would be most excited to receive updates from.

We already knew that the developers at Intercept Games would be losing their jobs thanks to a closure announcement from Washington State. Until remarks from Strauss Zelnick, the CEO of Take-Two Interactive, muddied the waters. Zelnick refused to acknowledge that the studio was being closed when asked by a reporter, even going so far as to claim the opposite. "We didn't shutter those studios," he told IGN. But it seems clear from one producer's testimony that Zelnick's remarks are inaccurate.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Quest Master answers the prayers of a certain segment of the Zelda fanbase by letting them create their own dungeons. With an art direction and gameplay heavily inspired by A Link to the Past, this fun homage is now available in Steam Early Access and gives players the tools to craft dungeons as clever or devious as they desire. Best of all, you can upload creations for other players to enjoy and experience the works of the community. Editors Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard do just that, exploring Marcus' custom dungeon to show off some of the game's toolset before playing a (far superior) community creation.

Cadaverous, perhaps) Age of survival horror on PS1, but it's rare you play one that invokes the N64, and even less often that you stumble on something horror-adjacent that riffs on Star Fox 64. Ah, Star Fox! The natural companion piece for, say, Eternal Darkness or The Suffering. In fairness, I did always find those Pez dispenser dialogue animations pretty eerie.

It’s only a matter of time before IllFonic perfects the asymmetrical multiplayer experience. Say what you will about its previous games; each one offered entertaining tweaks to the formula, small yet clever innovations, and a seemingly better understanding of what makes this genre so compelling. Killer Klowns From Outer Space: The Game embodies all these aspects, making it one of IllFonic’s best asymmetric games yet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To kick off with some extremely half-arsed mytho-geometry, the original Frostpunk was a testament to both the design utility and the inexhaustible political symbolism of circles. When people wish to found a community of equals they commonly form a circle, with each participant visible and audible to the rest. A circle is also the best shape for defending against an engulfing ambient threat such as a global ice age, because it has no weak points, and it makes a great centrepiece for a videogame interface, a symmetrical motif that can be tuned and adorned to either suck your attention into the screen or distribute it evenly in all directions.
Created by Polish developers 11 bit, Frostpunk takes place in the middle of a circle, an Arctic crater with a huge coal generator at its heart. Your city rises in rings around that generator, each additional layer of dwellings corresponding intuitively to decreasing temperature, and the result is one of the most focused and thematically consistent specimens of its genre - a building game that feels as intimate and urgent as tending a campfire. Frostpunk 2's new campaign mode breaks the circle open. It starts where you (hopefully) ended, with the crater now fully colonised and evolved into a glaring, blue-orange geode of high-density housing and clustered chimneys. But the view has been pulled back, and construction now unfolds along the plains and canyons beyond the crater, which consist not of circles but of hexagons - another UI designer's favourite - on which you'll plot out upgradeable districts rather than assembling individual buildings.

First introduced as a DLC fighter in Tekken 7: Fated Retribution, Lidia is the prime minister of Poland and a practitioner of traditional karate. The formal and proud fighter clashes with fellow karate practisioner Jin Kazama in the trailer and humbles the arrogant Reina by dishing out her new Rage Art. 


Lidia follows on the heels of Eddy Gordo as the two revealed Year 1 season pass fighters. Owners of Tekken 8’s Deluxe, Ultimate, or Collector's Editions automatically receive these fighters.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the biggest reasons Xbox acquired Activision Blizzard was for the Call of Duty series, a first-person shooter that has dominated the best-selling games list for decades. This would make it the perfect candidate to launch on Xbox Game Pass, Microsoft's gaming subscription service, in order to bring new subscribers in. Black Ops 6 was officially revealed last week, and while it was reported to be in consideration for a Game Pass launch, today, the news was confirmed from Xbox itself. Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will launch on Game Pass day one.
We don't know much about the game yet, but two live-action teasers have been released so far. The first features a group of people covering the faces of Mount Rushmore with blindfolds that say, "The truth lies." The second, released today, can be seen below.


It features world leaders' black and white camera footage speaking in hushed tones about a grand conspiracy about manufactured wars and the elusive nature of the truth. The trailer ends with the game's full title, along with a reminder that the full reveal will come on June 9, after Xbox's summer showcase.

The last Silent Hill Transmission happened in 2022 and revealed a surprising amount of Silent Hill news including the reveal of the remake of Silent Hill 2, Silent Hill f, a new Silent Hill movie, and more.
The post announcing the event reads, "Consider this your invitation letter to Silent Hill. ✉️ Tune in May 30 at 4 p.m. PDT to our SILENT HILL YouTube channel for the second installment of the #SILENTHILL Transmission where we'll share game updates, a deeper look at the film, and new merch."
The safe bet is a teaser trailer for the movie and hopefully new details about the Silent Hill 2 remake and Silent Hill f, the latter of which seems like the franchise's next big original entry. Silent Hill Ascension, the online mobile narrative game where players dictated the story choices, also finished up its first season (though the developer may have a different term for it), so it's possible we may learn what's next for that game.]]></summary>

You’ll quickly realise this a school-with-no-trousers-esque dream sequence, but the matted mess of thick black cables that carpet this dingy side-stage is painfully accurate. Pissing around with gear is roughly 70% of the band experience, in my limited experience of being in bands. This probably changes when you’ve got roadies or dedicated tech people, but we did not, because we were skint. And also terrible. Several hours of Deathbulge has brought me more joy than several years of being in actual bands. I had some isolated good times in some of those bands, but I’m having a very good time with Deathbulge.

When Rock Paper Shotgun reported the 1000 corpses to detectives, we were told this was "normal" and "appropriate".

"Just announced: Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is coming to Game Pass on day one later this year!" it reads. Sounds like a solid confirmation from me, though Microsoft and Activision have yet to start bellowing the news from any of Call of Duty’s official pulpits.

The studio's follow-up Zenless Zone Zero is now set to release on July 4th. For anyone who hasn't yet heard of the bright cyberpunk character action game, I guess now's your chance to look at the slick anime visuals in the new trailer below and go "hmmm", with either a songful note of eye-widening interest or the suspicious rumble of a free-to-play skeptic.

Sometimes, it's because those people have succeeded in levelling up out of games journalism, or found their way into another echelon of the craft. Other times, the losses are more abrupt and arbitrary. In each case, one short term response is intensification. Those of us who remain must be rockier, paperier and more shotgun than ever before. With that in mind, here are this (four-day) week's new PC games of note.

It transpires that just eight weeks after its launch early February, top tier football league Serie A filed a complaint at an Italian court accusing Cloudflare of providing "services to pirates" that undermine Piracy Shield. In parallel, the system is already exceeding blocking limits agreed with ISPs. Now the law needs to be changed, so domains and IPs can be unblocked to free up capacity.

If you haven’t seen the trailer for Kingmakers, I encourage you to watch it now before continuing. If you have, or perhaps you are reading this magazine in an effort to limit screen time (you’re doing great, and we appreciate your support), I can’t continue to talk about the game without spoiling its major twist. The trailer teases what appears to be a medieval strategy game with base-building elements before a contemporary, but admittedly junky truck screams through time to arrive in the middle of a battlefield brimming with horses, suits of armor, and presumably the shouting of old English phrases, but it’s difficult to hear through the chaos.

It had a simple premise: Your character flees through a crumbling urban landscape, making great leaps across rooftops at the touch of your phone screen. It met great success and charted in what was then only a burgeoning mobile game ecosystem. Canabalt popularized the infinite runner genre and would ultimately put its designer, Adam Saltsman, on the map.
Now working under the name of Finji as its creative director, Adam’s rise as a designer as well as his partner’s, Bekah Saltsman, as both a publisher and CEO, has been stunning to watch, especially considering the simplicity of that first big hit.

I had the chance to catch up with director Takayuki Nakayama about the importance of the Great Demon.

During that conversation, Nakayama shared an intriguing anecdote about how important Ed was to the development of Street Fighter 6.
When the team sits down to decide on the characters, they think of balancing out the roster not only in style, but through the regions and countries the characters represent. However, the story of the game –in Street Fighter 6's case, World Tour – also plays a big role.

Players assumed the role of The Captain as they built up their small colony of workers to a flourishing city in the post-apocalypse. Along the way, players needed to make hard decisions, like restricting food, enforcing strict authoritarian laws, putting children to work, or worse.

In the meantime, popular LLMs seem to be developing a stubborn, pro-copyright streak, partly due to all the industry propaganda they've been consuming. But don't fight back, it's time to team up.

That near-decade has brought a whole heap of additions, expansions, packs and updates to the enduring life sim game, to the degree that the underlying tech serving as the foundation for dozens of later mechanical and visual elements can sometimes look a bit wobbly these days.

The captivating, combat-free Metroidvania is rich with a delectable buffet of challenges, puzzles and secrets to find even once you’ve seen the credits roll. Still, players have chewed their way through its more-ish platforming and puzzle-solving much faster than its solo developer intended, it turns out. Luckily for us all, creator Billy Basso is already looking ahead to a new game set in the moody zoo-niverse - even if that’s not a complete sequel.

We're not going to talk about any of that hoity-toity quantum wheeling-and-dealing in this piece, however. We're going to talk about the fact that the opening stretch reminded me of Gears Of War and the many over-the-shoulder adventures it has influenced. I'm sorry. It's been a complicated week involving minimal sleep, and I no longer have the grey cells for branching timelines, though they are certainly the more fascinating aspect of this game.

There’s Deathbulge of course, but also the upcoming Anger Foot, Abiotic Factor, and a load more I’m sure. There was also literally Door Kickers, but that was ages ago. Anyway, the latest game to put a hinge-disrespecting protagonist front and center is also my current obsession: the excellent Post Void/Hotline Miami-type beat, Mullet Mad Jack. It’s a very fast, very silly FPS about shooting robot billionaires that takes its aesthetic from 80’s anime and PC-98 games. I’m not sure what else you need, honestly.

Still, if we take for granted the idea that a review is only really valuable as an insight into the experience of the player: I haven’t been feeling especially great this week. That in mind: Splintered Sea is more Besiege, thoughtfully applied to its already expansive toolkit. More importantly, it's currently bringing me deep and deeply needed moments of untainted, childlike, vaguely-Orkish joy.

I’m usually a lot more suspicious of hardware leaks, which are often just out-of-date or otherwise inaccurate info, but I’ve also sat through enough mic-muted prebriefings to know an official slideshow when I see one, and that appears to be exactly what Videocardz got its hands on. Besides, these specs include a gigantic 80Whr battery upgrade (doubling the ROG Ally’s 40Whr capacity), so we can at least file this under "News James wants to be true."

Innocent times and places like the prologue for Baldur's Gate, which unfolds in the vast, fortified monastery of Candlekeep (beware spoilers from this point on).
BioWare's first ever RPG opens with your unsuspecting Chosen One learning the ropes from the old sage Gorion. There are fetchquests that take you around the enormous citadel, bits of combat training to do, cosy formative chinwags to have with characters like your childhood friend Imoen. But it's not to last, of course: Gorion is murdered, and you must rove the Sword Coast in pursuit of his killer. When you return to Candlekeep later in the game, this once-proud bastion of learning has been filled with doppelgangers of Gorion and other acquaintances, a parade of chatbots waiting to stab you in the back.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While I’ve always thought the race towards graphical hyperrealism isn’t as pervasive as it's often perceived, Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2 is definitely one of those games. The kind that probably has twelve artists dedicated to the recreation of visible pores, that sort of thing. It’s so focused on looking pretty that it hasn’t even noticed the title and subtitle got mixed up.
Sure enough, Hellblade 2 is a harsh test for older hardware, with a heavy reliance on DLSS or FSR upscaling to keep performance sweet. That said, it’s no Dragons Dogma 2-style technical horrorshow either. A happy balance of visuals and smoothness is attainable on plush PCs and low-end laptops alike, while DLSS 3 frame generation can deliver an effective kick in the framerate pants on RTX 40 series GPUs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In Anthology of the Killer you do not exit the game using a pause menu. You exit it by walking down a back alley into the quavering arms of two hungry bears. This is just one of many laughs your diaphragm will endure as you navigate "the escalating adventures of a girl trying to make zines in a town of giallo-style masked serial murderers". The horror comedy already won its creators the Nuovo Award at the Independent Games Festival this year, recognition that has been a long time coming for prolific game maker Stephen "thecatamites" Gillmurphy. If you're unfamiliar with his work, you can get acquainted next week, when Anthology of the Killer gets its full release on Itch.io on May 28th.  At which point you can explore its unsettling urban hell of shady corporations and cops who think they're cool. There's a trailer below.

While its Epic Games Store release can be worked around, and Proton GE will get the game’s own launcher running, no combination of software, compatibility tools, or installation folder deep-diving seems capable of actually booting the game proper.
As such, I’m accepting defeat. Obviously with apologies to any studious Steam Deck Academy readers.

With the decision to pull the game from sale and turn off its servers for months on end after allowing people to sink their real-life money into unlocking costumes and such (with no refunds), its developers are now looking to seemingly give something back in return.

Which clearly makes it the perfect fit for a bit of upcoming DLC for military-fetishising interactive gun range Call of Duty.

Former vidbud Liam and I used it, initially, as something we could do while catching up on life. But now? Now we're all in. Liam has created a spreadsheet of things we're ticking off to prepare for the upcoming expansion, and I think it's the perfect summation of what the game is to us: something that makes no sense at all and yet something that makes our brains hum with happiness.
And what we've found with Destiny, in all of its bloat, is that we haven't explored for a single second since our return. Everything is accomplished through menus, making it quite Starfield-esque, which is terrible… but also good. We can't make sense of it and we don't think we ever will.

A beam of light shoots out of a mysterious planet and a zoom in reveals the beam to be an asteroid, but not just any asteroid: a crystal shaped like a teardrop, with a little ghost nestled inside. You awaken as this little ghost, who it turns out, has crash landed in Eternity (and who, it turns out, is called Hauntii). Soon you bump into a ghostly girl, who guides you to a tower that thrusts you both up to a higher plane - but though she ascends, you're dragged back to the bottom at the last moment by some netherworldly chains. And so, as Hauntii you travel through Eternity to discover who that girl was and, ultimately, how to ascend to those heavenly skies yourself.

You nod with solemn respect and you say, "Alice". An Alice is someone you should not take lightly, nor take for granted, nor leave unmonitored. For they will destroy worlds and build better ones while you are not looking. This is dangerous and exciting. Alices are a force to be reckoned with. To treat an Alice poorly is to invite shame, dishonour, and contempt. Here are some of the best Alices in video games!

As is their druthers, FromSoft have at once made the events it depicts feel of earth-shattering importance while providing basically no concrete information. A lot of people will be putting out gargantuan theory posts right now, rambling on about Miquella, the Crucible, the Golden Order blah blah. This is all a distraction. Anyone with eyes can tell you that the primary movers and shakers of this final chapter in the Lands Between are a secret faction of hitherto secret spear people. You're likely confused, and that's understandable. As the foremost authority on ephemeral nonsense in Elden Ring, I’m the only one who has your back here.

Until fairly recently the nearly 15-game-strong series, where Disney characters cross over with Final Fantasy and go to war alongside a child wielding a key (I said I don't properly understand it), wasn't on PC. After some games arrived on the Epic Games Store in 2021, Squeenix have confirmed that multiple Kingdom Hearts games are coming to Steam next month, on June 13th. Unlucky for some, maybe, but not Donald Duck and Goofy, two of the main characters. Long has Goofy been seen as just a joke character in the minds of people people who didn't watch A Goofy Movie. Hopefully this brings his heroism to a wider audience.
