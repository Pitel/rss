        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["We were working on getting the rights to this game for several years".
2002's The Thing is widely regarded as one of the best horror games based on an existing media franchise. Many licensed horror games are sadly relegated to genres that require a specific setup, such as asymmetrical multiplayer or short VR experiences, but The Thing — a third-person squad-based shooter — dared to go one step further, telling its own unique story that serves as a proper sequel to John Carpenter's 1982 movie masterpiece.
It's not a game that frequents mainstream remaster wishlists, but Nightdive Studios is nevertheless delivering what few of us realised we wanted with The Thing: Remastered. Announced during IGN Live and scheduled to land on the Switch later this year, Computer Artworks' original is getting the full revamp treatment, with updated visuals, improved lighting, numerous quality-of-life tweaks, and more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If your luck while opening EA FC 24 packs have been poor so far, the Greats of the Game Team 2 Upgrade SBC could be a massive help. 


This is the first time when EA Sports has released a SBC that drops a guaranteed Hero or Icon card from the current promo. Moreover, the costs of completing the SBC is pretty meaningful as well, especially when you consider all the possible rewards that you can obtain. 


EA FC 24 Greats of the Game Team 2 Upgrade SBC rewards


The entire pool of rewards can be divided into two main categories - Icons and Heroes. Do note that the reward pool only includes the items that are part of Team 2 (and are also available in store packs). 



Rui Costa CAM 93


Jorge Campos GK 93


Enzo Fracescoli CF 93


David Trezeguet ST 93


Hugo Sanchez ST 93


Gianluca Zambrotta RB 93


Ricardo Carvalho CB 94


Claudio Marchisio CM 94


Stephen McManaman RM 94


Marcel Desailly CB 94


Frank Rijkaard CDM 94

Nadine Kessler CM 94

Johan Cruyff CF 98

Ronaldo ST 98



The Greats of the Game Team 2 Upgrade SBC require two tasks - 84-rated squad and 85-rated squad. This SBC is certainly worth trying as the cost of completing is remarkably low. You could end up getting one of the best items currently available in Ultimate Team. 


Do note that all the Heroes and Icons are eligible for up to two levels of upgrades based on how their nations perform in the Euro and Copa America tournaments.

If you have found yourself scoring goals for fun but are unable to defend goals at your end, here are some helpful tips that can help you improve how you defend in FC 24.


1. Use team press


Team press is an extremely useful feature in FC 24, and it helps especially when you need to win the ball back as quickly as possible. When team press is on, the entire team will put pressure on the opponent team for a short period. There is also a cooldown period to team press, so you can only use it a few times during a match. Using team press is helpful when you’re losing a game, and need to put the opponent under pressure.

Now, with a new film having just released, this seems like a good time for the developers of the upcoming The Road Ahead game to unveil a pretty intense trailer.


If you're like me and you like your horror to come with a dose of "no you cannot defend yourself, please hide instead," then this should be right up your alley. A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead takes the concept from the films and drops you right into it, facing off against the gangly monsters that hunt by sound alone.

It's no secret that AI, and specifically generative AI, has become more and more prevalent in recent years, but if you're concerned about Nintendo utilising the technology in its game development, then you can put those fears to rest... at least for now.
During the company's recent annual shareholder meeting, president Shuntaro Furukawa was specifically asked about Nintendo's interest in applying AI to its game development. Furukawa acknowledged AI's benefits but seemingly confirmed that Nintendo would not be pursuing the technology for the time being, citing potential issues with intellectual property rights (a topic the firm is infamously strict about).

Outside of needing to progress the main story here, it's a place to sell gear, store items in a storage box, and start Void Intercept Battles. One vendor is quite useful when it comes to the central grind of the game but can be hard to locate. Here's how to find Anais in The First Descendant.


How to find Anais in The First Descendant


Image via Destructoid.


To find Anais, you want to head to where you spawn then run to the right. Pass by the stairs down to Alpha, then head down the later stairs toward Deslin, the weapons vendor. You should see a small circular room nearby which you want to enter. It's located somewhat between the Module upgrade vendor and Deslin. Alternatively, you can use the above map to locate Anais.

Once at Anais, speak with her to view her various research options. You can research new Descendants, Weapons, and other pieces of gear using Gold and numerous resources. It'll take quite some time and grinding to acquire these, though you can purchase them with real money if you wish. Once you have the various parts and cash to purchase something, start constructing it and wait a short time. After that time is up, the Descendant or piece of gear will be yours to select whenever you wish.


Where can you get parts for Descendants and gear?


If you want to go the grinding route, there are a few places you can look. Void Intercept Battles are a great source of gear for Descendants like Gley, whereas anything else can be earned from farming activities in any of the game's regions. This is on a case-by-case basis, so you'll need to examine whatever activity you want to farm to know what it drops.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The First Descendant has turned out to be an extremely popular online shooter with hundreds of thousands of players across all platforms.  With so many players, there have been a few connection and networking issues affecting a handful of players. Here is how to fix The First Descendant Game Login Failed [LE:13] error that can occur.





How to fix Game Login Failed LE:13 Error in The First Descendant


On July 3, many players on The First Descendant started encountering the 'Game Login Filed' error when trying to login, producing the LE:13 Error code. This error is related to connection and server-related issues, and the fix for 'Game Login Failed' is most often to simply wait as it means the game servers for The First Descendant are down. 


Even though the error can be annoying especially when you're trying to get in and level up some descendants, you can at least take solace in the fact that it's not just you encountering this error. When the LE:13 error occurs immediately after logging in and your connection is stable, it means the servers are down and therefore everyone is encountering the error.


If you're not sure if it's the servers being down or your own internet connection, you can always double-check if The First Descendant is down. When they are, continuously trying to rejoin will not get you into the game as you simply won't be able to connect until the servers are back online. However, if the servers appear to be online and stable and you are still getting the 'Game Login Failed' LE: 13 error here are some things you can try:



Restart the game. Sometimes being on the wrong version can cause connection errors, and restarting will fix that.


Make sure your internet isn't having issues. If your ISP is experiencing downtime or an outage, it can cause some networking errors.


Ensure a stable connection. If you are on WiFi, try switching to a wired connection which can be much more stable.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We have you covered if you’re looking for how to get Caliber in The First Descendant. A lot of the cool items you see in the game’s shop require this resource, so we’ll tell you what you need to know about this.


How to get Caliber in The First Descendant


To get Caliber in The First Descendant, you will have to buy it with actual money. It’s a premium type of currency akin to those of Platinum in Warframe or Silver in Destiny 2. 


There are various packs of Caliber you can buy for varying amounts of money. In US dollars, these are the amounts you can get per pack:



250 Caliber: $4.99 USD


520 Caliber (500 + 20 bonus): $9.99 USD


1,060 Caliber (1,000 + 60 bonus): $19.99 USD


2,750 Caliber (2,500 + 250 bonus): $49.99 USD


2,920 Caliber (3,500 + 420 bonus): $69.99 USD


5,759 Caliber (5,000 + 750 bonus): $99.99 USD



Of course, the more you spend, the higher bonus you get per pack.

Can you get free Caliber in The First Descendant?


Unfortunately, it doesn’t seem like you can acquire Caliber for free in The First Descendant. Luckily, if you grind enough in the game, you can be quite powerful. That way, this doesn’t become a pay-to-win situation.


The only things you may be missing out on if you take a whole free route in The First Descendant are the cosmetics and anything tied to the Battle Pass. Even then, you will still be off just fine without it. It’s just a matter of whether you want to sink money into the game to speed things up or give your characters different looks.


Can you get Caliber through the Battle Pass?


You can get Caliber through the Battle Pass in The First Descendant. However, the amount is lower than that for which you bought it. The initial price for the Pass is 500, while you only make 300 back (granted that you complete it before the pre-season or season ends).

There is so much you could talk about, so many trails heading off in all directions, but perhaps it's best to begin with the more personal and superficial question that inspired this investigation: how did the open world game get so boring?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sukeban Games, developers of the influential VA-11 Hall-A: Cyberpunk Bartender Action, have revealed that they are working on a game outside their established series. .45 Parabellum Bloodhound departs from the visual novel format to present something closer to a quasi-turn-based RPG.


.45 Parabellum Bloodhound bills itself as an “Active Time Action” game. If you’re canny, you’ll recognize right away that this is essentially the combat system from 1998’s Parasite Eve. Essentially, you have a Final Fantasy-style ATB gauge that indicates when you can do an action, but while that’s filling, you can move about to dodge attacks. That is apparently “where comparisons end” to Parasite Eve.


According to the provided information, you play as Reila Mikazuch, “a killing machine emerging from depression looking to rebuild her life doing what she knows best. A path well-traveled where the consequences are known, but is her biggest foe really in front of her gun?”


The announcement also addresses the often delayed N1RV Ann-A, the follow-up to VA-11 Hall-A. The statement is that there’s no news. Sorry. Apparently, .45 Parabellum Bloodhound is ahead of it in development and will be where Christopher Ortiz focuses their attention for the “foreseeable future.”


As for when .45 Parabellum Bloodhound, Sukeban is currently just saying “when it’s done” but promises monthly devlogs. It’s currently planned for PC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As you play The First Descendant, you're going to collect tons and tons of loot. Some of this loot is quite useful, sporting higher DPS values than other variants or providing a better weapon type for your play style. A lot of this loot though isn't useful at all. This is where selling your unwanted gear can come in handy. How you do so, however, is a little unclear. Here's how to sell gear in The First Descendant.


How to sell junk weapons in The First Descendant

To sell junk weapons, you first want to head to the main hub of Albion if you aren't there already. From there, head to the right and pass where you normally speak to Alpha (don't head downstairs to Alpha). Head around and toward the assault rifle symbol shown, and you'll find the weapons vendor Deslin. If you're having trouble, there's a map above showing his exact location.


Once you reach Deslin, speak to him and select the Sell option. This will show all of your gear that you currently don't have equipped. Simply click on any gear you want to sell, and it'll be sold. This gives the currency Gold, which can be used to purchase various things on Albion including additional weapons from Deslin.

If you want to make the process much easier since you'll be doing this often. Open your inventory and check one of your submenus such as weapons or Reactors. From here, hover over any piece of gear you don't want to hold onto and press the listed Select Junk key. This will give that piece of gear a little trash icon. Once you return to Deslin and open up the Sell menu, press the Sell Junk button listed in the bottom left and you'll sell any junk you have marked.

The Sacred Tower Painting can be found a bit to the northeast of the Scorched Ruins, inside of a small cave. It’s a new Info Item that’s exclusive to the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC. 


While you will likely find this painting early on in the DLC, you won’t actually be able to solve the puzzle until much later after many of the bosses are defeated, and you’ve …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you've been trying to log into Xbox, you may have stumbled upon the error code 0x87DD0033. This issue prevents you from signing in, ultimately locking you out of games. Here's how to fix the error code 0x87DD0033 on Xbox.


Xbox 0x87DD0033 error code solution


The Xbox 0x87DD0033 error code occurs during a server outage or when experiencing a connection issue. Previously, the platform experienced a major outage in the Account and Profile section. Users weren't able to log in until the Xbox Support page announced a fix. Thus, if and when there happens to be another one, you'll likely need to wait until an update comes through. 


You should also check on the current status of the game you're playing. Sometimes, server maintenance periods can occur, as we've seen with Destiny 2. That said, it's best to keep track of this on the Xbox Status page, which provides the current status of various networks and titles.  


Screenshot via Xbox Support


If the servers are running, you may need to check your internet connection. You'll need to ensure that the connection is stable in order to clear up the 0x87DD0033 issue. Most online games, like The First Descendant, won't allow you to play them unless you are signed into Xbox. So, you'll need to clear up any internet issues beforehand to get it up and running.

To get benefits and perks in Valorant, players have to first link their Xbox account to their Riot account. Here is how to link the accounts:



Go to the Riot Games and Xbox Game Pass welcome page.


Log in to your Microsoft account, and make sure it is the same account that has an Xbox profile.


Click “Yes” to allow Riot Games to access your Xbox Live information.


Sign in with your Riot account.



Once, the accounts are linked. You’ll find the rewards and benefits in Valorant. However, these rewards will only persist in Valorant as long as you have an active Xbox Game Pass membership. It may take roughly 24 hours for the benefits to become available in the game after the accounts are linked.

Game Pass membership benefits in Valorant


In Valorant, Game Pass players get all Valorant Agents unlocked for free. Moreover, having an active Xbox Game Pass membership will also ensure that any new agent coming to Valorant is instantly unlocked on your account on day one. Valorant players with the Game Pass membership also get a 20% match XP boost that applies to Battle Pass, Active Agent Contract and Event Pass progress.


This XP boost will not apply to daily and weekly missions, or the overall account level XP. This 20% XP boost is not possible to stack with other XP boosts.

Warframe is changing. As someone with thousands of hours in the game, that should be scary to me, but like much of the playerbase, I find myself incredibly excited by it. This is not a forced change. Nobody sat in a meeting room and thought, “Let’s do things differently.” It is just the natural progression of a team that had worked together for over a decade on one of the most successful live-service games in the world. 


In a world where bombast and explosions are often used to wow the crowd, something that Warframe has done with style and aplomb over the years, the team is now leaning into moments of emotional delicacy to surpr…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Zenless Zone Zero will be released on July 2, 2024. As miHoYo's first major release since Honkai: Star Rail, HoYoverse fans are incredibly excited to hop in and see what the title has in store for them. However, you've got to make sure you log in at the right time on launch day.


Since Zenless Zone Zero requires an online connection to be played, it's also subject to downtime or just being unplayable when the servers aren't live or are experiencing issues. In the lead-up to the game's launch, you'll likely see the game can't be played because the servers simply aren't running at that time. If you wait patiently and log in at the right time, you'll see that you can get in and play alongside everyone else. 


What time will Zenless Zone Zero be released?

If you were around in the 1990s, you'll likely remember Polly Pockets. These tiny playsets provided a slice of life in the smallest of packages, cramming a house, pool or garden into a sealable clamshell container.
'Why are we talking about Polly Pockets in 2024', you might rightfully ask. Well, firstly, they're still available today (news to us), but more importantly, it's because we've seen Tiny Garden, an upcoming Switch game which smashed its Kickstarter goal in just one hour.

In The Legend of Zelda franchise, finding and carrying the legendary Master Sword is perhaps one of the most important tasks you'll need to accomplish to defeat evil and save the land of Hyrule. For one individual, however, carrying a replica Master Sword around in real life has led to a rather unfortunate jail sentence.
As covered by Eurogamer, a man named Anthony Bray from Nuneaton, England, was caught with a six-inch replica of the Master Sword while wandering about in public. According to Bray, it was intended to be used as a fidget toy, however, arresting officers stated that it "was in fact a sharply pointed item which could be used as a weapon and might put others in fear of it being used against them".

Tchia is incredible. If that's all you need to know, then good — this game is best played, in our opinion, completely blind. That's how we went into it, and it was all the better for it. Every strange, unexpected twist was a delight, and we never knew where the game would take us next. So, please, if you trust our opinions, trust this one: Tchia is incredible.
Here's what we knew about Tchia before we went into it: it had been touted as one of those nebulously-defined "cosy games", and it involved sailing. That much you could divine from its key art alone, with a girl on a raft sailing through crisp, blue waters towards sparkling white sands. It was only an hour or two into the game before we started to understand that Tchia is much, much more than that. Almost a ludicrous amount of more-ness, really, especially considering that the team that created this wonderful game is just 12 people.

And thus, Deck owners who’d persevered through a slightly fiddly installation process (explained here by YouTubesmith Deck Wizard) could finally take their first joyous steps into Wuthering Waves like a David Hasselhoff-buoyed East German in 1989.
Unlike the Hoff, it wouldn’t last. Within hours, Steam Deck players were being booted back out of the game by a hitherto-unseen anti-cheat failure. What gives? Or gave?

It’s the dogeared Fighting Fantasy from a carboot sale kid in me, I think. Something about reading worldbuilding snippets organised into numbered tables just hits in a way a novel doesn’t. Such tantalising ephemera is the name of the game in Microprose-published CrossOver: Roll For Initiative.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blood-meltingly beautiful.
Tsukihime is responsible for a lot of things. Back in 2000, Type-Moon’s classic visual novel captivated audiences with a story crammed full of occult mystery, thrilling action, and heart-pounding character drama. Like jagged lines splintering out of a unified core, its success spread out in many different directions: adaptations across manga and anime, the production of a number of sequel VNs, the birth of Type-Moon’s mega-popular Fate franchise, and, of course, the creation of its very own fighting game series Melty Blood. It’s no stretch to say that Tsukihime is a cornerstone of the industry, which is exactly why the title’s fade into relative obscurity is such a surprise.
For all the waves it made in the time during and after its release, Tsukihime has never been graced with an official Western localization. Moreover, the original Japanese release has long since become abandonware, with the task of preserving the game online falling to diehard fans. Suffice to say, it’s not the fate that a game many champion as one of the best in its genre deserves. Fortunately, Type-Moon has seen fit to rectify that problem by way of a full-on remake project.

That the letters appear to rely on evidence supplied by Spanish ISPs, indicating which of their customers accessed specific 'pirate' servers, is of even greater concern.

Do you remember the delightfully weird brawler Bare Butt Boxing that was revealed at a MIX showcase back in 2022? Well, after a period in early access, developer Tuatara Games has revealed that the pant-less fighter will be stepping into the ring on Switch on 1st August.
A name like Bare Butt Boxing tells you everything that you need to know, honestly. Yes, this is a boxing game where every character proudly places their posterior on display. A group of aliens travel to Earth and become obsessed with the wonderful world of boxing. Naturally, they want to try it out for themselves, but they miss a couple of key details.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Stormind Games and publisher Saber Interactive have released a new story trailer for A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead showcasing more of this upcoming first-person horror game's silent alien-infested world. And it continues to look like a scary new addition to the A Quiet Place movie universe. 
Though there's still no release date – it's launching sometime this year on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC – this story trailer reveals more about the state of the world in The Road Ahead. It seemingly begins on Day One, when the aliens, which possess incredible hearing that requires people to remain silent to survive, attack Earth. It then jumps ahead to Day 105, with Alex, an asthmatic college student trying to survive the end of the world with her boyfriend Martin, on the hunt for supplies and more. 
Check it out for yourself in the story trailer for A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead below: 


As you can see, it seems Alex might be pregnant, which, if you've seen the first A Quiet Place movie, can make trying to remain silent in this world quite difficult. We'll have to wait a little longer to find out how the story of A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead plays out because it launches later this year on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. 
For more about the game, watch the reveal trailer for A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Roguelite in disguise.
Outright Games has today announced Transformers: Galactic Trials, an all-new adventure for the robots in disguise that combines on-track arcade racing and third-person robot combat. What's more, it's coming our way on 11th October.
It feels like a slightly weird combination, but these are the Transformers, driving and shooting is kind of their thing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Past masters.
We often use the word 'evergreen' to describe a game which never gets old. Despite the passage of time, there's a stratum of untouchables that still feel as vital in the hands as the day they were released. Personal preferences and nostalgia will always, always come into play, but games like Super Mario Bros. 3 or Super Mario World? It's hard to imagine them feeling any better if they launched yesterday.
Critical consensus puts classics like those on a pedestal which seems precarious — they can't be that good, right? — but whenever you return, they do, somehow, stand up. You settle back and relax, relieved. You need never worry that a quick blast through SMB3 won't live up to your expectations.

Remember right before the release of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom when rumours began to circulate that Princess Zelda might be a playable character? That wish was never granted (sorry, spoilers), but the Hylian monarch is getting her time in the spotlight this September when The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom grants her the starring role.
We are, of course, pumped to finally get the chance to play solely as Zelda in a mainline game, but being a 2D, top-down adventure, there is still a little bit of us that wonders what a game starring the Princess might look like in Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom's art style.

One of the smaller chunks was a brief comment by Resident Evil 7 director Koshi Nakanishi, who confirmed that a new Resident Evil game is in the works. That's not too much of a surprise - big franchise gonna franchise - but still, it's nice to hear.  "It was really difficult to figure out what to do after [Resident Evil] 7," he said, "but I found it. And to be honest it feels substantial."

Nintendo is continuing to clamp down on Switch piracy this week by filing two brand-new lawsuits (thanks, TorrentFreak).
The first of these targets Modded Hardware, a group that has been on Nintendo's radar for a few months now — and with a name like that, you can imagine why. Run by Ryan Daly (aka "Hombrew Homie", apparently) Modded Hardware had built up a reputation for selling fully modded Switch consoles, memory cards that enable pirated downloads and other modding services.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Fear & Hunger games are pitch-black horror RPGs quite unlike anything else I’ve ever played, taking aspects of JRPG, survival horror and adventure games and distilling them into something I’d be tempted to call bleakly nihilistic if they didn’t display so much evident love for their craft. They also both start with a content warning listing “extreme violence, gore, sexual violence, and drug usage”. You’ll want to take this seriously, and just to be clear: the third item on this list does manifest in some tasteless, albeit brief, ways in the first game. It’s a frustrating blemish on what is otherwise an incredibly evocative and creative series, though you can download a mod to censor the more egregious bits. You will miss the full effect of critically severing an ogre’s massive schlong, however.

Developer Capcom released a demo for the game yesterday, ahead of its July 19th release date. So now the rest of us can join Edwin in becoming entranced by the swirling colours of this sword-swinger.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn has gone gold, meaning it should be all but ready for its release on July 18. Developer A44 (Ashen) has also released the game’s PC specs and 20-minutes of raw gameplay footage.
The upcoming "Souls-lite" fantasy action game stars elite soldier Nor Vanek and her furry fox-like companion Enki on a revenge quest to kill the gods of their world. She wields an arsenal of melee, firearms, and magic that can be chained to create stylish combo attacks. Nor Venek also has special traversal abilities to navigate the world, which is being besieged by the angry deities.
We last saw Flintlock during the Xbox Games Showcase a few weeks ago, but you can check out 20 minutes of new gameplay footage in the video below. Set during a later stage of the game, a synopsis adds context to the footage: "Join Nor and Enki as they prepare to step into the deserts of Wanderer’s Rest to take on the personal guard of the god Dukmar. With an entire army hunting for her, Nor will need all of her skills to make it to her eventual destination - the City of Sibyl, where she hopes the gods’ true intentions will finally be revealed."


Here are the game's minimum and recommended PC specs:

Processor: Intel Core i5-8400 / AMD Ryzen 3 3300X
Memory: 8 GB RAM

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time reinvented the series in 3D and became its new gold standard, Nintendo followed up with a surreal sequel in Majora's Mask. Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days. Majora's Mask's unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.
Join Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard today and each Friday on Twitch at 1:00 p.m. CT as they gradually work their way through the entire game until Termina is saved.

Created by developers Chibig and Nukefist, it's a "mini open world" game about carrying packages by broomstick while investigating the titular mountain, flying through hoops a la Pilotwings, and savouring the balmy inconsequentiality of an island that reminds me of Super Mario Sunshine. It also now has an early access release date, 21st August, and a charming new trailer.

If memory serves, when they ran that particular trailer I was busy sponging swampwater out my eyes after writing up South Of Midnight, while Nic had become so vociferously agitated over the debut of Doom: Dark Ages that he was no longer solid and tangible enough to operate a keyboard. Graham had long since absconded with Joanna Dark to Immersive Sim Land and Matt, poor Matt, had fallen into a Locust sinkhole while "omnimanouevring" around Black Ops 6. But if one of us had been free and willing we might have had enthusiastic thoughts about this "evolution of JRPGs", in which you must thwart a self-serious artist who is about to magically murder everybody over the age of 32. It is, alas, too late for me.

Two hours being the length of the free Dragon's Dogma 2 trial that is now live on Steam. For context, this is approximately how much time Capcom gave me to preview their latest action-RPG, many headline cycles ago. During that brief window, I managed to become the worst wizard in Dragon's Dogma 2, but I know you can go further. I'm so confident of this, in fact, that I'm going to start feeling all insecure and hurt in anticipation. How could you trample on my feelings so?

Infinity Nikki’s big PlayStation State of Play spotlight in May garnered an array of reactions. Fans of the popular Nikki series of mobile fashion games were excited to see the pink-haired fashionista make her triple-A debut. Unfamiliar viewers either dismissed it as an overly whimsical dress-up game or found themselves unexpectedly intrigued by its delightful and unique spin on an open-world experience. I count myself in that third camp. Something about the game’s premise stuck with me, but after playing several hours of a beta version, I’ve gone from admiring Infinity Nikki conceptually to being genui…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Don't Nod Entertainment has delayed its upcoming two-part narrative-driven adventure game, Lost Records: Bloom & Rage, to early 2025. As for why, the team wants to give its spiritual cousin, Life Is Strange: Double Exposure, some space to shine later this year. 
Lost Records was originally due out in late 2024, which is also when the next Life is Strange is set to launch. Instead of competing with Life Is Strange, a series that Don't Nod created with the first Life Is Strange and continued with Life Is Strange 2 before Double Exposure developer Deck Nine took over with 2017's Before the Storm and 2021's True Colors, the studio decided to push to 2025. 
We've made the decision to move the release dates of Lost Records: Bloom & Rage to early 2025. We know you're all excited for both Lost Records and the new Life is Strange game, and we wanted to ensure both have adequate space to shine. The wait will be worth it! pic.twitter.com/PH1O7z3uUy
June 28, 2024
Life Is Strange: Double Exposure launches October 29, and now, Lost Records: Bloom & Rage, which will be released in two parts, will launch sometime early next year. Both games are set to release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. 
In the meantime, watch the reveal trailer for Lost Records: Bloom & Rage, and then watch the Life Is Strange: Double Exposure reveal trailer. After that, check out this extended Double Exposure gameplay trailer to learn how the game will acknowledge the first Life Is Strange's endings.

In the latest episode, they're discussing their (relatively new) Boston studio and how it's spearheading the as-yet-enigmatic sequel to Cyberpunk 2077. There's a lot of middle-managey chit chat but one thing that stood out was one developer's earnest remarks about what he considers some of the sci-fi RPG's shortcomings. 
"I see that we didn't push the envelope far enough in some places, for instance," said Paweł Sasko, Associate Game Director at CD Project RED.  "Like, let's say the homeless crisis... when I look at it, I'm like, we weren't far enough in '77. We thought that we were dystopian, but... we just touched the surface."

It's interesting then, that FromSoftware's president Hidetaka Miyazaki sees Elden Ring as "the limit" for FromSoftware in terms of project scale (cheers The Guardian for the interview, and PCGamer for the spot).

They’d like to “revisit some of the games we've created in the past and modernize them,” Ubisoft told Ubisoft about Ubisoft.
Elsewhere in the blog, Guillemot repeatedly praises what he sees as the potential for generative AI and how it “can enrich NPCs to be more intelligent, more interactive,” saying this could “potentially extend to animals in the world.” So, look forward to remake Ezio putting glue in his pizza sauce I suppose?

Despite my expectations, I was not prepared for how robust it actually is in Veilguard. Robust enough, even, that BioWare used it to create most of the NPCs in the game, save for mainline characters like companions. Setting hyperbole aside, it is a staggeringly rich creation system, and I look forward to seeing player-created near-replicas of celebrities and monstrous creations that'd be more at home in a horror game. 
But I'm also looking forward to the community's reaction to the Dragon Age series' best character creator yet. At the heart …]]></summary>

And last week, we traveled to California to go hands-on with the game. You can read Game Informer's full Concord preview thoughts here, but in short: it feels great and we're excited to play more. 
We have a lot of questions remaining about the game's progression, seasonal content, narrative emphasis, and more, but if the handful of hours we've played of Concord are any indication, developer Firewalk Studios has, at the very least, created a fun and great-feeling shooter. In today's New Gameplay Today, host Wesley LeBlanc talks about his visit to PlayStation's HQ to play the game with Kyle Hilliard and how he felt after checking out 10 of the game's 16 heroes and three of its gameplay modes.

Last month, PlayStation released the first big look at Concord, its upcoming 5v5 multiplayer hero shooter from Firewalk Studios, a team it acquired last year. Though the recent cinematic footage teases something like a single-player, narrative-driven heist game akin to a Guardians of the Galaxy movie, the gameplay reveal that followed showcased the strictly multiplayer experience in a new light. Admittedly, this reveal left me feeling blasé; it looked fine, but not necessarily something I hadn't seen before. However, after playing the game for a few hours during a recent previ…]]></summary>

There's no combat, and no enemies that I can see - instead, you'll occupy yourself with equipment management, repairing your dinky car, and improving your hiking skills using points earned by doing favours for villagers along the way.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Besides giving The First Descendant the ol’ benchy marks on desktop, I was curious to see how this gleaming looter shooter would run on the less flexing hardware of the Steam Deck. The answer: it didn’t, at first. Luckily, a semi-quick fix was enough to get me in, where I found a game that for all its ray tracing inclinations, is comfortable with life on the Deck. Reasonably. Most of the time.
With any luck, my issue could be purged completely by the time The First Descendant releases on July 2nd. Partly because I was using a technically non-final preview build, and partly because the problem itself was a silly one: launching was blocked by a case of missing Visual C++, something that the Steam Deck’s Proton compatibility witchcraft usually takes care of. Come on, Proton lad, you’re kinda dropping the ball here.
If this ever happens to you, in The First Descendant or any other game, I heartily recommend YouTuber JD Ros’ video tutorial on fixing it. The method boils down to installing the latest C++ versions via the Steam Deck’s Desktop Mode, then adding their executables to the game’s launch options. This worked a treat for me, and I didn’t suffer any further compatibility headaches from there on out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Frostpunk 2 has been delayed. Originally slated to launch next month on July 25, the upcoming narrative-driven city-builder is now arriving on September 20.
Developer 11 Bit Studios sates that following a recent beta, the team wants to take extra time addressing feedback to ensure the best possible experience. In a press release, design director Jakub Stokalski and art director Lukasz Juszczyk issued the following statement:
“Based on the surveys we received after playing Beta, the average rating you gave us was 8 out of 10. We’re super grateful for that! At the same time, it was only a small slice of a work-in-progress, still-growing game. While our backlog is plentiful, it was an opportunity for us to listen to what you enjoyed, and what didn’t quite land yet”. 
“This allowed us to prioritise things better, and bring upfront the features and modifications we were already working on. But we also realised that to guarantee the best possible experience on launch, we need more time to finish the development of Frostpunk 2. That’s why we made the difficult decision to postpone its release to September 20th, 2024”.
11 Bit States that it plans to work on new additions to existing game mechanics and improve the UI and UX, among other things. 
Frostpunk 2 will launch first for PC on September 20. PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S versions are planned to arrive later. We recently played the game, and you can read our extensive preview here.]]></summary>

It might be set in a medieval fantasy realm, a relatively straight-laced world of square masonry and parchment maps, but it portrays bread-and-butter RPG fixtures with much the same flair as its strutting high school cousin.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Aspyr Media and publisher Lucasfilm Games have revealed that an enhanced edition of 2002's Star Wars: Bounty Hunter will launch on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC this August. More specifically, it hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC (via Steam) on August 1, and it brings with it updated visuals and controls and a new skin that harkens back to the original game's most infamous easter egg. 
In the reveal trailer, we get a look at the graphical improvements Aspyr has implemented in Star Wars: Bounty Hunter, but the game still retains that 2002 PlayStation 2 and GameCube charm. This re-release follows a limited PlayStation 4 physical run that launched back in 2019.

If you're unfamiliar with Star Wars: Bounty Hunter, you play as Jango Fett throughout the story, which itself is a prequel to Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones. 
In the original game, there was an easter egg message that said, "Cash in all bounties to play as Boba." However, cashing in all bounties did not let you play as Boba. To make good on that original promise from 2002, Aspyr media has included a Boba Fett skin in Star Wars: Bounty Hunters you can use after completing the game's campaign. 
Star Wars: Bounty Hunter hits PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC on August 1. 
While waiting for its launch, check out this lengthy gameplay demo of Star Wars Outlaws, another mercenary-centric Star Wars game launching this year. Read Game Informer's Star Wars Outlaws cover story after that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When the ageing, silent character you play in puzzle adventure Selfloss performs a roll, it is a tumble of such poignant melancholy I spent the first five minutes of my time with its Steam demo just keeling about in the starting area. It’s a ponderous, pained roll, creaky and ancient. If it has i-frames, the ‘i’ stands for “I would like to not do that again for at least five minutes, please.” Each time you roll, or sprint, your character wipes beads of sweat from his brow, and you can tell the exertion is genuinely taxing. My man is exhausted. Also, surrounded by fish, both symbolic and literal.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I mentioned it briefly in my Shadow Of The Erdtree review, but there's one area of the DLC where your steed Torrent is so scared they refuse to be summoned. That's because said area is a woodland that's been steeped in shadow and chaos for so long, large goats don't dare clop their hooves. What I hadn't expected was that relying on my own two trotters would be so... revelatory. It's made me reconsider exploration in Elden Ring's open world, and conclude that using Torrent as a taxi service contributes to a feeling of disconnection.

In a post ominously titled "Tribes 3 Player Update", Prophecy first announced that anyone who’d paid up microtransaction money in Rivals – as well as their previous game, extraction shooter Starsiege: Deadzone – would receive an equal amount of credit to spend in their upcoming "sports shooter" Ultra Strikers. Then, the bitter chaser: both Deadzone and Tribes 3 will go on the backburner, while Ultra Strikers becomes the studio’s main effort.

The aim, NEXON tell me, is in motivating players to try out different approaches to combat rather than relying on flat progression.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dragon Age: The Veilguard consultant and former Dragon Age executive producer Mark Darrah has published a Youtube video addressing the question: "why do AAA games take so long?" It's a tidy 25 minutes or so, and gets a fair way into the weeds of a variety of topics, from the current enthusiasm for live service "forever games" over 'finite', narrative-led affairs, to the "misleading" announcement of highly-demanded sequels years before they enter full production, in order to pump up a publisher's brand during a dry spell.
One thing I wanted to fish out and drop on your plate is Darrah's discussion of what he terms "the fidelity death cult" - that is, the desire for ever greater levels of lifelike visual detail and "intricacy".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Capcom has revealed Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster, a remaster of the Xbox 360 game that first launched in 2006. Though the once previously Xbox-exclusive game has since made its way to PlayStation and PC platforms, it remains unclear which platforms this remaster is coming to. And there's no word on when to expect the remaster either. 
Revealed with a short 47-second teaser trailer, Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster looks great, almost more like a remake than a remaster. It's unclear if this is a remaster of the original 2006 game or the HD version of Dead Rising that launched on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC back in 2017. Regardless, we're stoked to head back into a zombie-infested mall with journalist Frank West whenever this remaster launches. 
Check out the Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster teaser trailer for yourself below:

The more than 100 games included at launch was far from stingy, with an extra dozen being added in a free update at the end of last year. Now the collection will add almost 40 more games in an upcoming ‘Expanded Edition’, taking its total game count to over 150.

Truly a proto-Instagram-era Nostradamus. Almost ten years after the first game came to PC, and upsettingly close to 20 years from its debut, the original Dead Rising is coming back in a fresh remaster.

Charming! The Ancient Greek gods were outraged both by the king's violation of the norms of hospitality, and by his general insistence on being too clever by half - and I feel a similar way reading the Xitter feed of Bashir "ManliestDev" Kashalo, who is making a game in which you play as Sisyphus after his eventual demotion to Hell's chief stone-shover.

Sometimes you get to grapple onto a vast robot crab. The first evil alien overlord you fight is named Greg. Not bad, not bad. It’s also, wholeheartedly and unapologetically, a big graphical show-off, complete with multiple ray tracing modes and shinier power armour than if you fed the entire cast of Warframe through an industrial car wash.
Happily, this doesn’t necessarily translate into chugging performance on low-end PCs, or even handhelds like the Steam Deck. But judging from its final preview version, which has just closed prior to the July 2nd release date, feasting on The First Descendant’s finest visuals will definitely tax your rig – and it has its share of technical quirks on the side.

Outside of remasters and remakes, the Super Monkey Ball franchise has been dormant for a decade. At a certain point, it began feeling like AiAi and his crew of monkeys were relics of a bygone era and that Super Monkey Ball was little more than a nostalgic series that has no real place in the modern gaming landscape. Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble disputes that assertion by delivering an experience that’s at once delightful, maddening, and rewarding, but above all else, fun.
At its best, Banana Rumble’s Adventure Mode delivers some of the top stages in Super Monk…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The internet doesn't exist in the world depicted by the film Aliens, though variations of it crop up in the expanded universe. Nor does the idea of a digital society. There's networked communications tech, but it consists of signals between bodies in deepest space, light years apart, of lonely video terminals in cramped dockloader apartments, and of maniacally collaged CCTV feeds of Marines getting their asses kicked, man. There's no ocean of online interactions, corroding the everyday from all directions, just 1-to-1s through boxy, retro-futurist screens that are so dingy and inadequate it feels like Ripley and Burke are peering at each other through a letterbox. Small wonder, given that Aliens was released in 1986, when what would become the internet was still mostly the province of universities and the military.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Publisher Playtonic Friends (the publishing arm of Yooka-Laylee developer Playtonic) and Blossom Tales developer Castle Pixel have revealed Cattle Country, a simulation game that's Stardew Valley meets the Wild West. If its first trailer,  which was revealed by IGN today, is any indication, farming/townbuilding sim fans will want to keep an eye on the game. 
The reveal trailer gives us a great look at what to expect, which includes ranching, treasure hunting, mining, farming, and, of course, romancing. The game is coming to PC sometime in the future, but there's no release date or window in sight. Cattle Country's Steam listing simply says the release date is "to be announced." 
Check out the Cattle Country reveal trailer for yourself below: 


As you might be able to hear, the Cattle Country reveal trailer is narrated by Red Dead Redemption 2's Arthur Morgan, or rather, Arthur Morgan's voice actor, Roger Clark. 
"Cattle Country straddles the saddle of cozy wholesome gaming and action-adventure," the game's Steam listing reads. "Serving up hours of the slice-of-life you'd expect on the frontier – including mining, fishing, crafting, and farming – along with deep-rooted Wild West quests delivering stories of romance, cattle drives, bandits, and robberies."
Here are some Cattle Country screenshots: 

While waiting to learn more about Cattle Country, read Game Informer's Stardew Valley review, and then read about Stardew Valley developer ConcernedApe's next simulation game, Haunted Chocolatier.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The one and only Elden Ring expansion we're getting, Shadow of the Erdtree, launched last week and thousands of Tarnished went to the shadow realm to take on dozens of new enemies, bosses, and more. Now, just a few days later, developer From Software has released a new patch for the game that should make Shadow of the Erdtree a bit easier. 
Now live, Calibration Update 1.12.2 targets the scaling of the attack and damage negation given to players with each Shadow Realm Blessing upgrade. Here's what's changed: 
The attack and damage negation has been increased for the first half of the maximum amount of Blessing enhancements, and the second half will now be more gradual. 
The attack and damage negation granted by the final level of Blessing enhancements has been slightly increased. 


This patch should apply automatically like any other Elden Ring update but if it doesn't – the Calibration Version listed at the bottom right reads "1.12.2" if it has – select "LOGIN" and that will apply the latest version of the game. 
The only other thing this update contains is word from From Software on a confirmed bug where the raytracing settings of Shadow of the Erdtree are automatically enabled (if you've previously loaded save data from previous game versions), which is causing framerate issues for some players. If you're encountering said issues, check to see if you have raytracing on or off in the game's system graphical settings. 
This patch arrives after one that hit the game last week, which added new hairtsyles, inventory features, balance adjustments, and more to Elden Ring ahead of Shadow of the Erdtree's launch. 
For more about the game, read Game Informer's Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree review, and then check out this interview where From Software's Hidetaka Miyazaki discusses his approach to difficulty in games.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Celebrity streamer and Midnight Society co-founder Guy Beahm or "Dr Disrespect" has finally responded in full to allegations that he was banned from Twitch for sending sext messages to a minor. In a much-edited statement on Xitter yesterday, Beahm confessed that, yes, he messaged an "individual minor" via the Twitch Whispers chat service in 2017, characterising the messages as "casual, mutual conversations that sometimes leaned too much in the direction of being inappropriate, but nothing more".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With a groan, it rises. The first Resident Evil is a piece of horror game history, and it has just come shambling back to PC after a long time putrefying. Ye olde games shoppe, GOG.com is selling the 1996 survival horror classic as a digital download, so you don't have to go rummaging through eBay auctions to find an original physical copy anymore. It's going for £9/$10. But the smile-raiser is the revelation that its sequels, Resident Evil 2 and Resident Evil 3: Nemesis, will also be getting reanimated in their original polygonal glory.

There are three classes to choose from: Rogue, Mage, and Warrior. As the names suggest, each features a unique combat system and plays differently as a result.

There’s something quite special about Still Wakes the Deep. A horror game, quintessentially Scottish through and through, with an atmosphere so tense you could hear your heart pounding as you explore areas, has the right ingredients to make for a memorable experience. Additionally, it’s made by The Chinese Room, the studio behind multi-awarded titles such as Dear Esther, Everybody’s Gone to the Rapture, and Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs. And yet despite these advantages, it still falters when it comes to the fundamental facets.

Thirsty Suitors, a story-driven turn-based RPG about a woman battling her various exes (to the chagrin of her disapproving parents), launched last November. The surreal experience also features skateboarding gameplay and cooking mechanics, with the entire package garnering positive reviews upon release. The move to Netflix Games means it will become available to play on mobile devices for Netflix subscribers. There's no date for when Thirsty Suitors arrives on Netflix, but it's "coming soon."


As for new games hitting Netflix this month, acclaimed point-and-click mystery game The Case of the Golden Idol is now available. Joining it is Cozy Grove: Camp Spirit, the Netflix-exclusive sequel to 2021’s Cozy Grove, Hearts, and Netflix Stories: Perfect Match. Subscribers can check out all of these games right now.

As Nic wrote earlier in the week, a portion of the negative feedback is aimed at the expansion's difficulty, which is certainly a Thing To Hear after years of being told by kindly gamers that I only hand out low review scores because I can't press the buttons in the right order.
As publishers Bandai Namco have sweetly observed, struggling players are perhaps forgetting that you can raise your overall power level by gathering Scadutree Fragments, a system of collectibles designed to ensure a tough challenge even for endgame players, while giving you the option of effectively rebalancing the expansion through exploration. The downside there, as a few people have pointed out, is that some players don't want to hunt for collectibles before they can topple the bosses.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed, the remake of 2010’s Epic Mickey, has a release date. Look for it to arrive on September 24.
The game was first revealed during a Nintendo Partner Direct in February. The remake is being handled by developer Purple Lamp and features reworked gameplay (the original was played with Wii motion controls, after all), new brush abilities for Mickey, and a graphical upgrade. A new trailer features a chat with the game's original creative director Warren Spector, who is also involved with this remake, to reveal Rebrushed's Collector's Edition.
For $199.99, this special box is available for pre-order now and includes the following items:
The full game Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed
A 28 cm Mickey Mouse statue
An Oswald the Lucky Rabbit keychain
A vintage Mickey Mouse tin sign
Six Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed postcards
A Collector’s Steelbook
The Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed costume pack


If you missed the original game, it sees Mickey explore a fantasy world called the Wasteland filled with obscure Disney characters, namely antagonist Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, Disney's original animation star who predates Mickey Mouse. The Wasteland has been taken over by an entity called the Blot, which Mickey accidentally unleashed and must now stop. The 3D action platformer sees Mickey wielding a magic paintbrush that can create new objects while erasing others, and Mickey's actions shape his destiny and the game's story. 
Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC. You can read our review of the original Epic Mickey here.]]></summary>

There are gunfights, too, with dice serving as bullets, but so far, I've only managed to die of pathetic human error and clumsiness. Consider me unenlightened, but enthused.

The 2022 interactive documentary is getting an expansion that adds new timelines and 39 games.
This new version of the game is called Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration Expanded Edition, and it arrives on October 25. It will be released as DLC to Atari 50 owners and as a standalone title, both digitally and physically. Developer Digital Eclipse (which Atari acquired in 2023) is bolstering the compilation with two new timelines.

Word on the reviewvine is that it's jolly decent, offering free movement around a real-time 3D reinvention of the original point-and-clicker's shimmering archipelago, with its many murals of crushed and scattered civilisations. There’s still a demo on Steam at the time of writing, a relic of long-ago Next Fest 2024. Demos tend to be removed once the game hits shelves, so I thought I’d rush you a quick post based on 30 minutes with the remake over lunch.

Despite kicking off Nintendo’s fourth-generation console with a starring role in Luigi’s Mansion on GameCube, Luigi's sequel always felt a little relegated. He was downgraded to the handheld platform, but it wasn’t because he delivered a bad game. The video game formerly known as Dark Moon has always maintained a positive reputation, but after the success of Luigi’s Mansion 3 on Switch, it felt like part two missed its time to shine. Thankfully, Nintendo and Next Level Games have brought it to console, and while it’s not without its formerly-a-3DS-game quirks, the…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The co-operative clambering of Chained Together is easy to understand. It's like Fall Guys in the fiery pits of hell, with a tower of fiendish platforming challenges. It brings to mind the mind-shattering failures of Getting Over It and a previous short-lived clamber sim called Only Up. Also, you are chained to your teammates. Every time you fall in this fiery multiplayer de-motivator, you are taking your pals with you, usually right back to the start. At RPS, we are not fazed, this should be straightforward. Nic, Edwin, and Brendan are all disciplined people. Yes, they are bound together in unbreakable irons. Yes, Nic does sometimes leap into the abyss without warning. Yes, they remain divided on precisely what obscene act the giant demon in the game's background is performing with his idle hands. But none of this means they can't work together to escape the inferno. Right?

I am morbidly curious about them, although I cannot ascertain their texture just by looking, which worries me. A Khorne dog, however, is a texturally simpler proposition. You can tell just by looking at today’s new legendary hero for strategy game Total War Warhammer 3 that he’d be quite difficult to chew, should you get to that point. Either way, the price is definitely easy to swallow - he’s completely free as part of today’s patch 5.1.0, which also brings substantial changes to multiplayer.

Yes, yes, it’s a deeply skilled expression of martial prowess that turns your enemy’s aggression back at them. But it’s also a pleasingly low-effort method to make your opponent look very silly - the combat equivalent of waving your outstretched hand and shaking your head in unison. I assume so from videogames, anyway. In reality, I could not parry a nerf dart with a metal bin lid.

The RIAA-managed lawsuits accuse the owners of Udio and Suno of copying the labels' music on a massive scale and the labels suggest that they're already on the back foot. In pre-litigation correspondence, both were 'evasive' on content sources before citing fair use, which the RIAA notes only arises as a defense in cases of unauthorized use of copyright works.

The latest release, Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree, has attracted attention and, in some sectors of the fan base, controversy for how punishingly difficult it is. The week before the expansion's release, we sat down with From Software president Hidetaka Miyazaki to talk about the notion of difficulty and how the passionate fan base has surprised him over the years.
The Soulslike genre, particularly From Software games, puts an emphasis on death as part of the gameplay experience. When you fight a challenging enemy, it may feel insurmountable, but by taking a studious and persistent …]]></summary>

At the very least, remakes offer a great way to play antiquated or less accessible experiences on modern hardware.

Via Xitter, the original game’s creative director John Garvin has encouraged fans to "never say never" about a Days Gone 2, while reminding us that a full outline for the game had already been completed prior to his departure from developers Bend Studio in 2020.
Even with the caveat of "I’m not holding my breath", Garvin’s take is an altogether more hopeful one that that of fellow Bend alumni and Days Gone game director Jeff Ross, who in May tweeXed a collage of popular PlayStation characters – sans his own post-apocalyptic motorcycling hero, Deacon St. John. "A lot of people still ask me if there will ever be a Days Gone sequel, so I submit this poster as evidence it will never happen", Ross wrote, along with an apparent pop at Sony Interactive execs (including Hermen Hulst, co-CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment) for never being "fans" of the game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A former developer at Total War studio Creative Assembly has written a lengthy personal account of his time at the studio, in which he details development troubles on strategy game Total War: Rome 2 and Total War: Attila, and alleges that these issues were exacerbated by an inflexible and counterproductive leadership structure and “chronic mismanagement,” sometimes resulting in what he calls a “toxic work environment.”

My dreams are ablaze with scenes of sunlight percolating through shifting layers of beech and oak, with visions of dirt paths winding through bramble. Now, here comes Engraving to transform all those dreams into nightmares.

The operation led to searches targeting 13 pirate IPTV administrators, and 1.3 million pirate viewers reportedly had their screens "blacked out." The statement raises several important questions, but the decision to mention the "completely innovative way" the pirates obtained the content is not something usually discussed in public.

Looking at it, you might expect this costumed nuisance to be another grafted abomination, its layers of papier-mache, binbags and repurposed carpets hiding a rippling quilt of flesh and bone, perhaps a real lion that has been shaved and stitched to its theatrical double. The truth is more appalling still: it's just two guys in a lion suit. They aren't even sewn together mouth to backside, like in the Human Centipede. Way to bait-and-switch, From!

The Elden Ring DLC is currently metacritic’s highest rated expansion of all time at 95, beating out the The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt’s Blood And Wine’s 92. However, roughly a third of the 41,000 user reviews on Steam are negative.

Though Minecraft has been playable on PS5 for years, it's always been the PS4 version; this native version, however, is a new build of Minecraft made specifically for PS5, which means it will theoretically perform better on the console. 


"Currently, however, the only way to play Minecraft on a PlayStation 5 is by purchasing the PlayStation 4 version of the game," the announcement reads. "By developing a native version of Minecraft for PS5, we'll be able to make the game run more effectively on the PS5's hardware." 
Though Mojang hasn't revealed how long the Minecraft PS5 version preview will last, all are welcome to take part in it, so long as they own the PS4 version of the game. To access it, go to "Settings" on your PS4 version of Minecraft while playing on a PS5 and select "Preview." This preview includes the new Tricky Trials update, so you can venture into the trial chambers, meet a breeze, craft a mace, and more. 
Mojang asks that players who encounter bugs during this preview report it to the developer, and more generally, provide any feedback they might have. 
For more about the game, read Game Informer's Minecraft review, and then check out this story about how actor Jack Black has all but confirmed he's playing Steve in the upcoming live-action Minecraft movie. After that, read about Netflix's animated Minecraft series.

However, with seemingly months to go before the game’s fall 2024 launch, BioWare announced it was changing the name to Dragon Age: The Veilguard. Ahead of that announcement, Game Informer visited BioWare's Edmonton office for an exclusive look at the game for our Dragon Age: The Veilguard cover story. It's here we learned that the name had changed.
I interviewed various Veilguard leads for the cover story, and one of the first questions I asked each of them was, "Why the name change?" Here's what each told me:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[YouTuber Videogamedunkey, otherwise known as Dunkey, announced in 2022 that he started a game publishing company called Bigmode, and its first game, Animal Well, launched to critical acclaim last month. In a surprise announcement in a video Dunkey released yesterday, Bigmode revealed the next game it is publishing: Star of Providence. 
At the end of Dunkey's E3 2024 video, he cuts to a new trailer for Star of Prodivence showcasing the pixel-art shoot-em-up with a retro soundtrack to match, and it looks awesome. The game was revealed last year, but this publishing announcement footage reveals it's coming to Switch and PC (via Steam) in February. 
Check out the Star of Providence reveal in the video below: 


"Descent into the facility and seek out power eternal in this tough as hell, shoot em up masterpiece," Bigmode's website, which also describes the game as a bullet hell roguelike action game, reads. "Engage in pulse-pounding battles with over 120 enemies in an ever-shifting gauntlet loaded with oncoming bullets and game-changing powerups. Only the most hardcore will survive." 
Star of Providence features more than 120 unique enemies, a vast array of weapons, upgrades, and modifiers, six playable ships (each with a different gameplay style), randomized level layouts, chaotic boss fights, and "fish," whatever that means, according to the Bigmode website. 
Here are some additional Star of Providence screenshots: 

Star of Providence hits Switch and PC sometime in February of 2025.

In the past, Sonic Team creative officer Takashi Iizuka told me Shadow is his favorite character in the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise outside of Sonic. It makes sense; after all, as the director of Sonic Adventure 2, where Shadow made his debut, Iizuka was instrumental in creating the dark hedgehog. 
"Even now, if you ask me who my favorite character is, Shadow is going to pop up there," Iizuka says. "Even when we think about the foundation of the entire franchise, Sonic and Shadow are really holding up so much of the franchise. They're very popular and dynamic characters."

From Dragon Age: Origins' real-time strategy RPG approach to Dragon Age II's mostly-set-within-one-city action experience to Dragon Age: Inquisition's strategy-action mix, BioWare hasn't quite defined the franchise's combat. However, a through-line is apparent from Origins to Inquisition: BioWare seemingly wants this franchise to be action but has attempted to shift to that without abandoning its longtime fans. 
With Dragon Age: The Veilguard, BioWare has completed its transition from strategy to real-time action, but thanks to an optional tactical pause-and-play combat wheel that harkens back to the series' origins, I feel it's found a great (battle)ground …]]></summary>

But something about that game has stuck with players. In addition to resonating with a wider audience than many of From Software's most iconic titles to that point, Bloodborne delivered an engrossing world full of mystery and challenge, causing it to remain top-of-mind for many Soulslike fans even today. In the lead-up to the launch of Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree, I sat down with the creator of Elden Ring, Dark Souls, Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, Demon's Souls, and Bloodborne to learn why the 2015 PS4 exclusive holds as special a place in his heart as it does the game's many fans.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hot off the Boston Celtics' NBA Finals victory last night, we learned of a new way we can step onto the court this summer. Nintendo Switch Sports, the successor to the overwhelmingly popular Wii Sports series, arrived in 2022. While the initial offerings lacked depth and sometimes left us craving more than the base game was able to deliver, Nintendo has stuck with the title and has improved the offerings through free updates. A few months after launch, the title added golf at no additional charge, and during today's Nintendo Direct, we learned that another free update is coming to the game this summer to add basketball to the mix.
Nintendo Switch Sports' implementation of basketball uses motion controls to dribble, pass, and shoot. You can participate in two-on-two matches locally, or compete in Five-Streak Battle matches and Three-Point Contests. You can also take part in a solo Three-Point Challenge, where you need to make as many baskets as you can before time expires.
Nintendo Switch Sports' basketball free update arrives this summer. For more on Nintendo Switch Sports, be sure to read our review of the base game here.]]></summary>

        <link href="https://www.scummvm.org/news/20240615/"/>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a universe where bagels meet bars, the BAGEL engine has been perfectly toasted, and the ScummVM team is now ready to serve a slice of The Space Bar nostalgia. No, it’s not the key on your keyboard. Rather, it’s a detective story set on a distant planet. Important data has been stolen, and the perpetrator is a shape-shifter laying low in a spaceport dive bar until he can flee off-planet. You play a hard-boiled detective who has the skill to psychically visit bar patrons’ memories to gather clues and narrow down suspects.
This is thanks to the kind people at ZOOM Platform, who provided us with the original game sources to work with. Help us test the game by grabbing a daily build. Read through our testing guidelines. The game features a lot of options to chat around with bar patrons’ and do various actions in the different flashbacks. So we really need people to spend time experimenting and make sure everything works correctly. And please take some screenshots along the way.
If you don’t own The Space Bar, you can try one of the free demos or purchase it digitally from the ZOOM Platform. Testing is also available on Steam via a beta branch, check the Steam announcement for more details.
Now, good luck, and fingers crossed you can find the perp. Otherwise, your bureau chief will have you getting up close and personal with toilet duties for the rest of your career. Oh, and PS: The viewpoints of different aliens differ. For the Bartender, who has segmented eyes, even the original developers felt it was difficult and left in a cheat key of ScrollLock to switch back to a single viewpoint. Feel free to use it if, at any point, the flashback becomes too much for you :)
