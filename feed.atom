SEGA is still showing support for last year's side-scroller Sonic Superstars with all sorts of DLC, and the latest promotion is a new collaboration with the restaurant chain IHOP to unlock an exclusive Amy outfit.
According to the official PR, loyalty members can earn 'PanCoins' and redeem them for an exclusive Amy Rose outfit until 5th May. Any purchase with an IHOP account will unlock this offer. Of course, the catch is you'll need to be located in North America, as codes are region-locked.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Call of Duty players have come across a roadblock when loading the game or browsing the menu. We're here to show you how to fix the MW3 and Warzone black screen issue, including details on updates.


Warzone and MW3 black screen solution


According to COD Updates, you can fix the MW3 and Warzone black screen problem by restarting the game. This will provide a new update that fixes the issue. The problem links to a Season 3 server error, but fortunately, it should now be up and running with the latest patch. That means players don't need to go through the hassle of uninstalling and installing it again to get things back in motion. 


If the error persists, some Battle.net players suggest changing your region to fix the Call of Duty black screen. Once the area has been adjusted, launch the game and return it to your previous destination. Sometimes, the settings just need a little refresher to get rid of the bug. 


The MW3 and Warzone black screen issue appears across multiple devices, including PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. Similar to past Call of Duty launches, new seasons tend to bring out errors like this due to the large number of player counts. During this time, it's best to check for any new updates, as there have been several new patches after Season 3's launch. 


Check out the MW3 or Warzone Trello boards to keep track of any errors. Other known problems are present here, such as the Call of Duty not updating bug for Season 3. More fixes will likely arrive sooner rather than later now that the CoD team is aware of the various issues.

        <updated>2024-04-03T23:24:19.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Indie game developer Steelkrill Studio, best known for its psychological horror titles with a unique art style, has announced a new anomaly game titled The Stairway 7. In The Stairway 7, players are stuck in a creepy looping stairway with a cat. It's up to players to spot the differences as they ascend the stairway or else risk getting trapped.


Steelkrill certainly knows how to do psychological horror, responsible for the development of found footage survival horror game The Backrooms 1998 and World War 1 horror survival game Trenches. Earlier this year it also released the cosmic horror game Rotten Flesh where you descend into a dark sewer system in search of your dog Roy while calling for him using your microphone. All of Steelkrill's titles use a similar washed-out art style that really adds to the horror element, and it seems The Stairway 7 will as well.


It's hard not to draw comparisons to The Exit 8, but seeing Steelkrill's unique art style and charm mixed with this type of gameplay really has me excited. According to the Steam page for The Stairway 7, some anomalies will simply try to trick you while others will try to actually hurt and kill you. The further up the stairway you go, the deeper into the madness of the anomalies you go as well, causing more twisted and perilous environments.


While there is no specific release date just yet, Steelkrill plans to release The Stairway 7 next month on Steam.

There's a wide range of weapons available for players to pick up and use in their loadouts in Helldivers 2. Many of these come from Warbonds, where players can exchange Medals for new equipment to blast their foes away in missions, but some, like the Stalwart and Machine Gun, are locked as Stratagems. This means they must be called down to a planet for a player to pick up before being equipped, and they pack a real punch if you know how to handle them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Despite the recent updates, Helldivers 2 still has some issues. For some, the Arc Thrower misfiring, misaligned scopes, and the Spear simply not working have been constant concerns for Helldivers 2 fans. The good news is that the dev team knows. But fixes are not around the corner.


While chatting it up with players over at the official Helldivers Discord, Arrowhead Games' senior game designer addressed the aforementioned issues. Alex Kravchenko firmly told the community that issues "should and will be fixed." But those who are waiting for such a patch may be disappointed to learn that there probably won't be one for a while. As for how long, that's for Arrowhead to know.

To help sort your schedule, we've got a rolling list of the usual FFXIV events, timing estimates, and even speculation about what's to come. 


Below, we'll outline the FFXIV 2024 calendar's confirmed and tentative event schedule — along with some events that may have wrapped up for the year. Additionally, you can check out the MMO's usual calendar too, along with a little explainer on each of the year's festivities.

What are the new maps in MW3 Season 3?


Modern Warfare 3 Season 3 presents six new Core maps for launch and the Mid-Season:



6 Star


Emergency


Growhouse


Tanked


Checkpoint (Mid-Season)


Grime (Mid-Season)



Each map centers around 6v6 player-based matches found in the Multiplayer Playlist. The first four mentioned above will be available at launch, but the last two won't debut until MW3 and Warzone Season 3 Reloaded. Let's break down every location to see what's in store for these maps.

The device comes preloaded with sounds that you can play to add some appropriate sounds to your film recordings before uploading to Spooktube. This is all of the Content Warning sounds on the Sounds Player device in the new update.





All 21 Sounds on the Sounds Player


At the moment there are 21 sounds in total loaded on the Sounds Player. You can rotate them all using the scroll wheel when you have the Sounds Player as your active item. To play the selected sound, just click the Left Mouse Button. If you want to make sure the sounds are picked up on a recording, either be near the person with the Video Camera when you play the sound or make sure someone is near you using the Mic Boob or Reporter Mic.


Here are all 21 sounds that are available on the Sounds Player in Content Warning:



Badum tiss


Boom


Dramatic hit


Boo


Cheer


Crickets


Sad trumpet


Error buzzer


Correct


News Broadcast


Drum roll


Metal pipe


Funk stinger


Gameshow intro


Laugh


Scary kitchen


Slide whistle


Cool transition


Record scratch


Victory


Car skid



What does the Sounds Player do?


You can use the Sounds Player to play any of the above sounds, and then pick them up on your video recording. Other than sounds from other players and the sound effects from machinery in the Old World and entities, this is the only way to add sounds to your videos.


When you upload your recording to Spooktube, if you were able to successfully capture sounds in the recording you will see viewers leaving comments about the sounds which will also increase the amount of views you get as well.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Limbolane, the developer behind 2019’s Smile For Me, has revealed their new project, Great God Grove. It looks to be my kind of weird.


Great God Grove casts you as “the Gods’ new mail-carrier,” embuing you with the power to suck up dialogue boxes, which you then deliver to solve puzzles. Apparently, the gods aren’t around to avoid total annihilation, so it’s up to you to prevent “A-POCKY-LIPS.” That’s a lot of pressure for someone on a mail carrier’s salary.




The trailer released with the announcement shows off the same whimsical art style that helped make Smile for Me so memorable. Including puppets! One of my favorite moments is when the player character sucks up a dialogue box that says, “I’m HAM-HOT for a handsome god!” (aren’t we all?) which is then flung right into the face of a flattered god.


A more optimistic Zoey spoke of Smile for Me back in 2021 and found it to be a much-needed non-violent joy-maker in the vein of Chulip or Moon. You might say I was HAM-HOT for it. I also spoke a little bit with the devs, who seem pretty cool. Great times! If you haven’t tried Smile for Me, it was released last year on Switch, Xbox, and PlayStation platforms.


Great God Grove has a vague release window of “2024” and will be coming to PC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Paper is one of those items in Infinite Craft that acts as a catalyst for many interesting new recipes on your endless, wordsmithing journey. If you’re looking for how to start paper crafting in Infinite Craft, here's how to make the word Paper in a few simple steps. 


How to get Paper in Infinite Craft


The process to get Paper is quite simple. It can be achieved with the simple elements with some easy-to-follow combinations they make. Here’s the sequence of combinations for creating Paper: 



Water + Earth = Plant


Plant + Plant = Tree


Tree + Water = River


River + Tree = Paper



Screenshot by Destructoid


Combinations to use with Paper


Since Paper is such a plain word in this game, it also acts as a versatile crafting component to get into the more literary, entertainment, and political side of things. For example, here are some combinations we used to get you started:



Paper + Paper = Book


Paper + Book = Library


Paper + Japan = Origami


Paper + Love = Valentine


Paper + Trump = Fake News


Paper + Alien = Flying Saucer


Paper + Time = History


Paper + Thunderbolt = Zeus



These are only just a small handful of combinations you can get with Paper. The byproducts of it can be taken even further. For example, let’s use Book as the base:



Book + Iron = Steel


Book + Pikachu = Pokedex


Book + Snake = Bible


Book + Japan = Manga


Book + Romeo X Juliet = Shakespeare



With how far we have come along since the beginning of Infinite Craft, it has become significantly more difficult to get a First Discovery. However, with how many wild combinations you can get, and with important crafting items like Paper, there are still many more to be found.

Those who are looking to start playing the game – or have been away for a long time – may have questions. In particular, how the Spirit Box in Phasmophobia works has changed in small, but sometimes unclear, ways. 


Questions such as: What does it mean when I see the red light on the Spirit Box? Or; why won't my mother return my calls? The first I can help with, the second... that may be beyond my expertise, I'm afraid. Keeping it light, let's take a look at the three different types of Spirit Boxes in Phasmophobia and how you utilize each one. There's a difference in T1, T2, and T3, and some of those may net you a better success rate with calls.

It also periodically spits two hostile gunships into the air, which then turn their sights on you and your fellow divers.

Why is Kazuha so good in Genshin Impact?


Kazuha is an Anemo character, meaning he can hold the powerful 4pc Viridescent Venerer artifact set, which reduces enemy RES to a Swirled element. Unlike other Anemo characters though, Kazuha also provides an elemental DMG buff when he Swirls an element. If you’re able to Swirl multiple elements at a time, Kazuha will buff all of them!

They’re the most frequent imagery in my dreams, even moreso than the test I didn’t study for, or the homework that’s 20 years late, or all my teeth falling out. I don’t fully dig dream interpretation, but they’re generally a comforting presence. Warmth in the cold.


I also associate them with the cyberpunk genre. Cyberpunk used to be the pessimistic vision of the future, showing one of the worst-case scenarios for human advancement. And yet, most of what works in the genre depicted is somehow way better than where we are now. At best, a work in the cyberpunk aesthetic may have predicted what we’re dealing with now, and at worst, it was overly optimistic about how we’d apply our technological endeavors.

When the enemy is just too far away, or maybe when you want a little distance, they're always there for you. And the Hellfire Engine Crossbow adds some heavy artillery to your Baldur's gate 3 arsenal.


This special crossbow can be crafted in Act 3 of Baldur's Gate 3, once you've reached the Lower City. It's tied into the quest to Disable the Steel Watch, but before you going blowing the place to smithereens, take a tour through the factory. The Hellfire Engine Crossbow is very much worth picking up, especially for the ensuing fights in the Foundry.

While you may have some biblical associations with those names, all of their ingredients may not stand out immediately. They're a couple you'll definitely want in your kit, so it's worth a little experimenting to get there. 


With that said, if you just want the simple instructions for how to make Adam and Eve in Infinite Craft, I can break that down, too. Here's how you combine words like Steam, Mud, Venus, and Earth to get the pair.

To start off, we’ll make Adam. Follow these steps to get him:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes, the popular free-to-play Star Wars collectible turn-based strategy RPG mobile game, is coming to PC with cross-save functionality and improved performance. Speaking with the developer over e-mail, the team says, "We have been able to double the frame rate to 60 fps, added anti-aliasing, and implemented higher resolution settings so that players can take advantage of the power of a high-end PC." The game's layout has also been adjusted for the PC version.
Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes originally launched for mobile devices back in 2015, and has amassed a following over the years. In that time, players have figured out ways to emulate the game on PC, but this will be an official release. Along with improved visuals, the game will also support mouse and keyboard as well as keybinds (unfortunately "there is no controller support at this time"). Longtime players will also be able to bring all their progress over by linking their mobile account to their EA account when playing on PC for the first time, and all future updates will release on both mobile and PC platforms simultaneously. The teams says, "The PC and mobile version will always be in lockstep and release updates at the same time."
Beta access for the PC version will be available for current mobile players in May before expanding to a larger audience. From the developer: "For those interested, they can head to the Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes website, sign up for the EA App, link their account, and they are now ready to register. There’s a dedicated registration page that can be found on the website the day registration begins! For those selected, you will be receiving an invite via email for access to the Closed Beta."

How to use Acorns in AFK Journey


Acorns are used to ascend your heroes. Sometimes. A lot of the time, you use Soul Sigils, which are just duplicates of that hero. In fact, for Celestial/Hypogean characters, you can only use Soul Sigils. For some levels on A-Rank (Purple) and S-Rank (Gold), you’ll need acorns rather than Soul Sigils to upgrade their rank.


For A-Rank, this only happens once. You need 200 acorns from their faction to level them up from Mystic+ to Supreme.


For S-Rank, it’s 50 acorns to go from Epic+ to Legendary, 100 from Legandary+ to Mythi…]]></summary>

Combining elements from both the Metroid series and Koji Igarashi-produced Castlevania titles, this broad platforming genre has you using an ever-growing skill set to open up new paths across an expansive, layered map. As you explore and find secrets throughout the environment, these games empower the player in a way that makes them extremely addictive.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Each new Call of Duty season typically requires various patches, starting with a fairly sizeable file upon launch. Unfortunately, many players have encountered an issue that has forbidden them from accessing the newest content. So, if you are currently having problems with the network, here's how to fix the Call of Duty not updating issue. 


Call of Duty not updating solution


MW3 and Warzone Season 3 update loads have been running relatively slowly for many users. More specifically, full downloads for Battle.net players are not working. To fix the Call of Duty not updating issue, use the following techniques:



Restart game


Ensure that your internet connection is stable


Check the Call of Duty servers on DownDetector or Activision


Wait until the servers clear up or a new update arrives



I ran to the Call of Duty not updating problem, presenting an almost endless loop of a 'Check for updates" load. However, once I restarted the game, the patch was finally installed after a few attempts.

If you've initiated the usual steps of checking your internet connection, you may need to wait it out while the servers clear up. New seasons always seem to cause laggy performances and error codes, especially with the MW3 and Warzone Season 3 release. Currently, Activision Online Services indicate that Modern Warfare 3 and Warzone are experiencing outages with the network.  


On the bright side, the Call of Duty Updates Twitter/X account created a Trello card for the Call of Duty not updating PC issues. Console players could still encounter the problem, so it's best to wait until a new update comes through.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Given the huge popularity of 2003's Knights of the Old Republic, Star Wars and gaming fans have been hoping for an official remake of this classic RPG for years. Until recently, the state of a potential reimagining was left hanging in the balance. However, good news is afoot.


In a recent interview with IGN, Saber Interactive CEO Matthew Karch has confirmed that the Knights of the Old Republic project is still very much in development. The quote says the "game is alive and well" and the team wants to ensure it will "exceed consumer expectations."


In a nutshell: Saber used to be owned by Embracer Group. However, the studio recently split from the parent company, and the KOTOR  remake has been kept in the hands of the developer.




Outside that, however, there isn't much else to be said.…]]></summary>

How do you emote?


To emote in Content Warning you need to have first purchased an emote from the Shop Kiosk and then press the 'T' key by default to perform the emote. If you hold down the key you will continue performing the emote as opposed to quickly doing it and stopping.


If you don't like emoting being bound to the 'T' key, you can course change it in the settings by going to the Controls tab.

While Ubisoft Forward and Summer Game Fest aren't technically connected, they typically take place during the same time frame in LA, and this year is no different. With Summer Game Fest's livestream set for June 7, with the invite-only media and influencer event for hands-on gameplay with upcoming games set for June 8 through June 10, it seems press, influencers, and fans will cap off the summer's gaming streams with Ubisoft Forward.

Only time will tell.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Content Warning is the cool new co-op game on the block. You play with your friends to risk your lives for viewership in a twisted parody of the modern internet. Can you get in on that parody on modern consoles?


No. Content Warning is only available on PC. Hold your horses. Content Warning was created by a small independent team, and it just came out on PC.


Don’t look so down. That doesn’t mean it will never come to console. It might! The team at Landfall released quite a few games in the years leading up to Content Warning, and many of their more popular titles, such as Totally Accurate Battle Simulator, did make it over to console. So there’s definitely precedent. It could happen for Content Warning, as well.


However, the official word from the dev is “Cool your jets.” That’s paraphrasing. What they actually said was “Hi! We don't know about consoles yet :) it's too early to say!” Again, that’s not a “no,” but it is a “let us get our feet on the ground first.”


As it stands at the time of writing, Content Warning is available on PC, and only PC. It may come to consoles in the future, but the Landfall is not confirming anything yet.

In the space of a single, rollercoaster paragraph, Betts earned my curiosity by describing himself as a fellow Soul Reaver enthusiast, lost it again by criticising Soul Reaver’s camera - such insolence! - and earned it swiftly back by mentioning that he’s from Yorkshire. Then, he upgraded my curiosity into attention by describing The Horror At Highrook as a “clockwork narrative” horror experience that takes inspiration from Poe, Stoker and Lovecraft on the one hand, and from boardgames, wiki-hunting and escape rooms on the other.
This is a heady brew indeed. Also, there appears to be a cat in the game called Mr Tubbs, described as a “portly grey barrel of fur”. I entertain suspicions of Mr Tubbs. What fell secrets lurk behind his perfectly groomed exterior? Anyway, here’s the trailer.

The victors of that particular forum skirmish were probably DICE's Battlefield games, with their woozy Frostbitten cinematography and dependable multiplayer tactic of having a whole team focus fire on a single capture point, gradually reducing it to stumps of foundation. But leftier souls may have preferred Volition's (RIP) Red Faction series, the third of which, Red Faction: Guerrilla, featured a granular demolition engine that you bash apart whole bases with a sledgehammer.
Well, Guerrilla's lead tech designer Luke Schneider is still in the architecture-ruining business: his and Radiangames's latest, the hopefully self-explanatory Instruments Of Destruction, leaves Steam early access on May 10th, 2024. Here's the 1.0 trailer.

As someone who just got back from a vacation in Japan, I'm heavily missing these stores, conveniently located everywhere throughout major cities like Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka, and elsewhere. Perhaps that's why InKonbini's reveal trailer has me so excited to play this team's first game; but the game itself looks great, too.

Directed by Jared Hess (Napoleon Dynamite, Masterminds), the movie will star the likes of Jason Mamoa, Danielle Brooks, and Jennifer Coolidge, while reuniting Hess with Jack Black after their work together on the 2006 comedy Nacho Libre. Information on Minecraft's plot is rather thin on the ground at the moment, but we do at least know that the movie will remain relatively faithful to the game's visual aesthetics.

Surprise record-setters like Palworld, which I don't especially like, Helldivers 2, which I rather enjoy, and now Content Warning, which I'm still figuring out. If you missed it, the co-op horror game released on Monday with a temporary free promotion, and racked up a 200,000-player Steam concurrency last night. Published by Totally Accurate Battle Simulator outfit Landfall, it's sort of like Lethal Company in being about venturing into horrible places as a wibbly-wobbly defenceless explorer, but rather than gathering scrap for resale, you're filming yourself and the monsters in a bid to publish a viral "SpookTube" video, with tuber celebrity translating into cash for new equipment. 
Each video is edited together automatically from your footage and accompanying voicechat, once you return from each trip to the Old World, and you can watch it all on an in-game monitor with a mocked-up chat feed and viewcount. It's a pungent, potted commentary on the machinations of Youtube celebrity, with heady notes of "cautionary tale about algorithmic content generation" and "cautionary tale about people endangering or hurting themselves being a dependable source of views". Urgh, I can feel an op-ed coming on. In the meantime, here's how the developers - a team of only five - are updating Content Warning following its launch success.

We won't spoil the episode here, but in the teaser clip released yesterday, we see Jubilee and Roberto taking on Sentinel enemies in clear sidescroller beat 'em up fashion, and it looks awesome. Check it out for yourself below: 


If you enjoyed this clip, catching up on X-Men '97 is easy as there are only four episodes out so far. And even if you're not interested in this series, today's new episode is worth watching if you've ever gone hands-on with Konami's classic X-Men arcade cabinet.

While we've missed a handful on Nintendo platforms over the years (notably the lovely-looking 2008 reboot), the vast majority of entries are playable on Nintendo's consoles — a couple of them with multiple different ports.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Remake is "alive and well," according to Saber Interactive CEO Matthew Karch. He revealed this during a recent interview with IGN, where he also confirmed Saber took Star Wars: KOTOR Remake with it following its split from Embracer Group. 
Last month, Embracer Group, the company behind the closure of Saints Row studio Volition Games and layoffs at companies like Black Forest Games and Eidos-Montréal, sold Saber in a $500 million deal. It sold the studio, which is also developing the first-person adventure Jurassic Park: Survival, to a group of private investors under Beacon Interactive, which is controlled by Karch. At the time of the sale, the company didn't mention its Star Wars: KOTOR Remake, leaving excited fans concerned for the game, which itself has already gone through some rocky development. 


Now, thanks to Karch's interview with IGN, we know the game is still in development. 
"It's clear and it's obvious that we're working on this," Karch told the publication. "It's been in the press numerous times. What I will say is that the game is alive and well, and we're dedicated to making sure we exceed consumer expectations." 
That's all Karch shared about the remake, however, and IGN writes that in an investor call following the announcement of Saber's sale, Embracer CEO Lars Wingefors implied the remake might still be a long ways away. 
For more about the game, watch the Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Remake reveal trailer, and then read about how Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic's biggest issue is how it plays. After that, check out Game Informer's big list of upcoming video game remakes.

People like our hardware editor James then point and laugh at me, as an objectively wrong person. But according to a small study highlighted by the Guardian, I might have been right too! Turns out there's evidence that we might all see life at different FPS. That player might not be cheating, he might just experience Fortnite at a speed you don't.

That’s good, right? Growth is universally a good thing, otherwise all those nice, dead-eyed men in suits wouldn’t keep saying it was. You can’t just lie about growth, that’s a business crime. However, here’s some slightly more worrying news, depending on how much you value new ideas: Of all the game time that gamers spent gaming in quantifiable Big Year for Gaming 2023, just 20% of that time was gamed on games other than the 66 specific games mentioned in the report.

Japanese clothing retailer Uniqlo has announced a new range of t-shirts based on The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom (thanks, VGC).
Launching in Japan on 26th April, 2024 at ¥1,500 (roughly $10 / £8) each, the range consists of six designs based on Nintendo's sublime sequel to Breath of the Wild, which launched on the Switch in May 2023. No Western release for the range has been confirmed at the time of writing, but based on previous collaborations, we're confident that Uniqlo will bring them over shortly after the initial Japanese launch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Elder Scrolls Online is the elephant in the room where discussions of The Elder Scrolls 6 are concerned, though calling it an elephant is obviously missing the opportunity for a banger lore joke – “dragon”, perhaps, or even “Numidium”? Launched back in 2014 after seven years in development, ESO's hybrid of deceptively single-player-ish Elder Scrolls presentation with MMO fixtures attracted a lukewarm response, initially. “At its best The Elder Scrolls Online looks like a faithful addition to the lore,” intoned Brendy in our own launch impressions. “At its worst it is a derivative and uninventive anachronism.”
ZeniMax Online have made big strides with the game over the years, however - binning off monthly subscriptions and introducing a “level-free” format in the One Tamriel update in 2016. ESO has also swelled and sprouted steadily as a work of geography and history, with major chapters introducing areas hitherto only mentioned in dusty collectible tomes, or creatively reintroducing locations from the single player series – the forthcoming Gold Road expansion, out in June 2024, takes us to the West Weald in Cyrodiil, an area last seen in The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion.

Atari has today announced that its arcade-inspired racing game NeoSprint will be speeding off the early access start line and heading to Switch later this year.
This single-screen racer borrows a lot from Atari's Sprint arcade series with its top-down perspective (here a little more isometric, but you get the picture) and a focus on multiplayer. But Atari and developer Headless Chicken Games have added a handful of modern touches too, to keep things up to date.

When you first set up your Nintendo Switch to connect to your TV, you may have been aware of the dock's limitations when it came to connecting the necessary wires.
Looking at the dock from the back, the 'AC Adapter', 'HDMI Out', and 'LAN' ports all face toward the left. If your TV houses its ports on the right-hand side, this means you need to either loop the wires around to the right in order to connect them, or strategically position your dock to the left of your TV in order to alleviate the issue.

Nintendo is reportedly sending out a survey that has fans of a certain Mario series excited about what could be on the way.

Credit to Arma developer's Bohemia Interactive, however. Their April 1st announcement was that the latest update for Arma Reforger was Tiny Wars, a game mode in which you controlled tiny toy Army Men as they waged war around a proportionally huge home. As ever, this isn't really a joke, but it also wasn't exactly a lie, because you can actually play Tiny Wars for real now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[MechWarrior is a video game series that has been going strong since 1989, and was even a tabletop wargame before that. Clans, however, is the first time in a long time the video games have leaned into the universe's fiction in a big way. The single-player (or cooperative) campaign features a full narrative complete with cutscenes and characters, which is quite different from the recent entries which have primarily been focused on competitive online action.
Join Charles Harte and me as we take a look at gameplay for Clans, which is coming this year to consoles and PC.

It's worth noting there are some fast travel options in the game, but they're limited. Oxcarts are the easiest, most affordable option, but they're only available in certain cities, and each route only has one of two destinations. They're also prone to attacks. In one extreme case, I got off the cart to slay some goblins, turned around to get back on the cart, and saw it get absolutely decimated by a griffin attack, leaving me stranded in the middle of nowhere.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last week, Embracer Group announced it was selling Gearbox Software to Grand Theft Auto publisher Take-Two for $460 million. Hours after the sale, some Gearbox employees announced on social media that they had been let go from the company. Today, Gearbox has confirmed these departures.
In a statement to Eurogamer, Gearbox states that an unknown number of employees have been let go but that those affected are not tied to the development of upcoming games. Gearbox stated last week that it has six titles in the works, including a new Borderlands game. 
"As we strive towards our mission to entertain the world, we are grateful that our talent and capability are of interest to you and your audience," says Gearbox as part of its statement. "The Embracer Group will continue to report on their restructuring program that impacted some parts of Gearbox today that are not tied to the development of Gearbox Software games."
While Gearbox has not divulged the number of staff members let go, several employees took to social media soon after the announcement of the sale to announce their departures. Among them, Gearbox PR manager Jennifer Locke stated on X that she and “countless others” had been affected, as surfaced by Eurogamer.  
Embracer sold Gearbox (after acquiring it for 1.3 billion in 2021) as part of an ongoing effort to reduce costs after betting on a $2 billion deal with Saudi Arabia-backed Savvy Games Group that ultimately fell through last year. Embracer has spent the last few months either selling off its studios, shutting them down, or laying off employees as part of a massive restructuring process to recoup losses from this failed deal.

A reactive world means she can explore by harnessing weather events such as a flash freeze to augment ice abilities and create bridges to open new paths.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In Keepsake's co-op four-player space game Jump Ship, née Hyperspace, you can scuttle your own vessel by overcooking a pizza. There's a cooking minigame in your ship's canteen which grants a health boost if you nail the timing, and sparks off a fire if you don't.
It's a pretty minor fire, mind you. A combusting deep dish doesn't place very highly on the list of possible ship emergencies next to, say, your reactor coughing up nuclear rods, or your engines running out of juice because some oaf hooked up too many turrets to the aforesaid reactor. But if you leave the fire unchecked, perhaps because you're busy disposing of radioactive waste or vengefully unplugging half the point defences, it'll eventually singe your ship's health to nothing - insert appropriate Steam achievement pun and/or Klingon proverb. It's an agreeable little note of idiocy in a game that takes cues from Valve's timeless anecdote generator Left 4 Dead, Sea Of Thieves, FTL and, perhaps most surprisingly, Diablo.

Ex-Nintendo employee Takaya Imamura, best known for his work on Star Fox and F-Zero, is just about ready to unleash his new Switch game, with Omega 6: The Triangle Stars heading to Japan on 25th July, 2024 (thanks, VGC).
Published by City Connection in Japan and confirmed via a livestream event, the game is the first from Imamura since his resignation from Nintendo in 2021. Boasting 16-bit visuals and text-based gameplay, Omega 6 is quite a departure from his previous efforts, but there's definitely an air of familiarity with the character design (check out that Star Fox lookalike on the game's box art).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Like an aggressively competitive thane at a reindeer-piss guzzling contest, 2D tac-and-slash roguelite Sons Of Valhalla never lets up the pace for even a moment. Whether you’re charging across its pixel-art battlefields slashing and burning increasingly tough-to-crack strongholds, or making quick decisions to get the upper hand in its tug-of-war tactics, the only times Thorald is not doing cool violence, commanding others to do cool violence, or upgrading his camps so that he may act in cooler and more violent ways, is when he’s restoring stamina with a cool slug of mead or violently gnawing at health-boosting meat.
Viking Thorald Olavson is a man possessed. A rival Jarl burnt his village and nicked his wife Raya. In his quest to find her, he’s prepared to do anything - even visit England. As Thorald, you’ll butcher your way up a chain of command in your search for Raya across six stages, each of which sits somewhere between the side-scrolling tactics of Kingdom Two Crowns, the lane strategy of a Warpips, and the slashy/blocky/shooty/dodgy of any 2D ARPG you care to name.

This time, retro specialist Nightdive Studios is tackling one of the most ridiculous, polarising FPS games from the '90s: PO'ed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[He better watch out.
Back in 2014, a team of new developers calling themselves GalaxyTrail released Freedom Planet—a retro style platformer that captured the hearts of many classic-era Sonic the Hedgehog fans. Freedom Planet, in fact, started life as a Sonic fan game, though it established a unique identity for itself as development wore on, and sales were fortunately high enough that the team was able to greenlight the development of a sequel. Now, ten years on, Freedom Planet 2 has finally arrived for consoles, and we’re pleased to report that it is everything you'd hope for from a sequel. The level designs are tighter, the gameplay is more exciting, the graphics have gotten a nice boost; this is all around a much more confident and enthralling release.
The story picks up at the same time as the ending of the first game, with the climactic events of that finale causing an ancient Water Dragon named Merga to be released from a magical prison. The plot then jumps forward three years, following original protagonists Lilac, Carol, and Milla as they work to clean up the few robot stragglers left over from the events of the first game. The trio is then recruited by Neera, the new playable protagonist, for a meeting with the Magister, who asks them for help in getting to the bottom of who has been causing the recent robot attacks. Naturally, the ancient threat they unknowingly released has something to do with it, kicking off a lengthy journey to reveal this new villain’s motives and ultimately foil their plans.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, how was everyone’s long weekend? I don’t want to alarm anyone, but I think I may have even sensed the fading ghost of an immeasurably whisper-thin ray of sunshine at one point. Enough! Says a new patch for co-op shooter Helldivers 2. You know who else enjoys basking in the pleasant glow of mildly enjoyable weather when there’s freedoms that need fighting for? Bug sympathisers, that’s who. As such, the developers have gone and added new planetary hazards in the form of blizzards and sandstorms, alongside the usual balance tweaks.
Alongside these reminders that the war for democracy is never comfortable, the efficiently-named Patch 01.000.200 also includes a host of tweaks. Notable among these are balancing changes to the mission type ‘Retrieve Essential Personnel’, which now sounds more manageable. Enemy spawn points have been placed further away from the objective, “to give players a fairer chance of defending the location.” Additionally, fewer civilians are needed to beat the mission on higher difficulties.

PO’ed, in which you play a Pissed Off space chef crash-landed on an alien world, was not the very first game I owned for my PS1, but it was certainly one of, and it left a very strong impression. Probably because the first weapon you get is a frying pan, which you then use to batter horrible chicken-leg aliens. If you’re as lost as I imagine anyone hearing of this for the first time might rightly be, here’s that trailer.

It's another mercifully brief four day week in the UK due to reasons of religion, so let's roll with an appropriately snappy intro that avoids any extended digressionary preambles about, oh, I don't know, magpies fighting outside my flat this morning. Did you know that European magpies are great mimics? Second only to the Northern Mockingbird, apparently, though many ornithologists contend that the Brown Thrasher is sorely overlooked.

For a whole lot more on Harold Halibut, you can read this feature where I interviewed game director Ole Tillmann and art director Onat Hekimoglu.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Oh MMy — a new ScummVM release!
Please welcome the first ScummVM release of the year: ScummVM 2.8.1.
ScummVM 2.8.1 is a maintenance release mainly focused on fixing bugs that were uncovered since our last stable release.
This update includes upgrades for the following engines: AGI, AGS, GRIM, SWORD2, MM (which is now enabled — yes, we really skipped it in 2.8.0 by accident), mTropolis, NANCY, SCUMM, TWINE, Ultima, and V-Cruise.
The Android, Atari and macOS ports received multiple bug fixes, mostly for improving overall stability and preventing some crashes we’ve seen under certain circumstances.
The detailed list of improvements is available here.
As always, you can find the latest release on our Downloads page.
Go grab it while it's hot — enjoy!

An initial review published by the UK's Intellectual Property Office notes that inaccurate reporting may be due to a "lack of understanding." Further investigation would be required to find out the "cause and extent" and the subsequent impact on IP rights as understood by the public.

It's part of the planned obsolescence of the Quest 1 which Meta announced last year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time reinvented the series in 3D and became its new gold standard, Nintendo followed up with a surreal sequel in Majora's Mask. Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days. Majora's Mask's unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.
Join Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard today and each Friday on Twitch at 2 p.m. CT as they gradually work their way through the entire game until Termina is saved.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s been close to three years since Celeste and TowerFall developers Extremely OK Games revealed their next project, the similarly gorgeous-looking and sumptuous-sounding 2D exploration platformer Earthblade. While the studio didn’t give any indication of a release date at the time, we now know not to expect Earthblade until 2025 at the earliest.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dragon's Dogma 2 has dropped its first update, addressing one of the fantasy action-RPG’s most baffling decisions - the inability to start a new game once you’ve begun your first adventure - and letting you acquire a home of your own earlier, providing a reliable place to rest and save. There are some other small tweaks too, while Capcom dare to raise the question about future DLC in the wake of the game’s controversial microtransactions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Windowkill is the most inventive arcade shooter I've played for years.
It's twin-stick shooting in a tiny window that temporarily expands in that direction when you shoot its edges. You have to actively manage and maintain the play space itself for that to even be an option. Soon static monsters appear in their own isolated windows you'll have to shoot your way towards (their attacks can cross the void between), and before long there are the horrible hateful little blue bastards who sit there passively, soaking up shots and never attacking but actively pulling the edges of the window towards them.
It's a clever and great little thing and I sort of hate it as much as I like it.

This VR mech-fighting game has you pilot a giant mechanical gorilla, pummelling robots and human-controlled mechs with arms the length of lorries in grungy, trap-filled arenas. The combat alone is chest-thumpingly good, but Underdogs couples it with a fantastically evocative cyberpunk setting, and a smartly implemented rogue-like structure.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you finished Final Fantasy VII Rebirth and are curious to learn more about how it came to be, Sony and Square Enix have released a new making-of series called Inside Final Fantasy VII Rebirth. The four-part series features interviews with thirty of the game's lead designers, such as director Naoki Hamaguchi, creative director Tetsuya Nomura, and producer Yoshinori Kitase, who discuss how Square brought Rebirth to life.
Each episode tackles different aspects of Rebirth. Episode 1 focuses on world-building, Episode 2 covers the story/cutscenes, Episode 3 is all about the characters and combat, and Episode 4 tackles the English voice actors. Each episode runs between 15-18 minutes. You can watch the first episode below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, eh? I liked it a lot. 150 hours a lot. I big cried at least twice and welled up, much like a well, many other times. As much as I’d like to wax emotional about the plot and characters in an endless lifestream-of-consciousness ramble, articles need both headlines and subjects (truly an act of conspiratorial violence targeted at my personal dadaist instincts). So, let’s talk about just the minigames, because I think they’re wonderful for all sort of reasons that might not be immediately apparent.  Naturally, big spoiler potential ahead if, like me, you consider everything you haven’t experienced in the RPG game a spoiler.
I think one of OG Final Fantasy’s 7 best tricks is how it doesn’t just dish out its strangest distractions as a palette cleanser to the main meal of its action and drama, but actively works them in as an indispensable part of the menu. It also does this all without a shred of shame or self-consciousness, resulting in a cinematic video game with no inner turmoil or resentment toward either part of that equation - a characteristic I feel is suffered from by many of the games for which FF7 lead the way. Take the Gold Saucer. It’s an excuse to dick around and ride motorbikes, sure, but it’s also an essential story beat while the party takes time to relax and enjoy each other’s company away from the stress of travel and battle.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I think its reasonable to say that the term ‘fetch quest’ is well passed the point of being a neutral descriptor and has moved firmly into the realm of full pejorative. You won't see many games tout ‘epic fetch quests’ on their Steam Page, and you’re much more likely to hear the term lodged between the words ‘not a bloody’ and ‘again’, like two slices of exasperation-enriched bread stuffed with a shit-tier filling. Cucumber, perhaps. Not so, at least not for me, when it comes to Dragon's Dogma 2. The action RPG game has more or less solved the fetch quest problem. All it took, it turns out, was some interesting world design.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Red Candle Games made its name developing psychological horror titles such as Detention and Devotion, but its third game, Nine Sols, sees the studio veer into the action genre. First revealed in 2021, the Sekiro-inspired title is coming on May 29.
Nine Sols sports a hand-drawn art direction and an aesthetic that blends sci-fi, cyberpunk, Eastern mythology (the legend of Hou Yi in particular), and Taoism. Players control a cat-like warrior named Yi, who is awakened after years of slumber in New Kunlun, a city for humans created by nine god-like rulers. New Kunlun may appear to be a utopia, but a secret surrounds it as Yi embarks on a vengeful quest to take down all nine rulers. 


The 2D Metroidvania features fast-paced combat and a parry system directly inspired by Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice. In addition to a sword, Yi is armed with a divine bow and uses Taoist talismans to make enemies explode. A sprawling, interconnected map features numerous NPCs to assist, secrets, and challenging boss battles. 
Nine Sols is coming to PC via Steam (it also has a demo). You can learn more about Nine Sols’ creation and the history of Red Candle Games by reading our studio profile.]]></summary>

What seems clear, however, is that in one form or another, these types of actions seem unlikely to go away.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Embracer Group has divested Gearbox Entertainment from its stable of video game studios, with Take-Two Interactive purchasing the company for $460 million. This sale is part of Embracer’s massive, ongoing restructuring designed to cut costs after a planned $2 billion deal with Saudi Arabia-backed Savvy Games Group fell through in 2023. The sale comes three years after Embracer acquired Gearbox for $1.3 billion in 2021. 
This move means Embracer no longer owns Gearbox’s development entities, such as Gearbox Software, Gearbox Montreal, and Gearbox Studio Quebec, nor franchises such as Borderlands/Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands, Homeworld, Risk of Rain, Brothers in Arms, and Duke Nukem. These assets will be acquired by Take-Two, which owns Rockstar Games and 2K, among other labels. Closing of the tr…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A regular rogue's gallery of independent game developers - including the makers of Dead Cells, Slay The Spire, Darkest Dungeon, Spiritfarer, Terraria and V Rising - have clubbed together to run their own videogame showcase: the Triple-I Initiative. Initially screening on 10th April, it'll be a 45-minute, unhosted, back-to-back series of trailers, reveals and surprise game or demo releases, designed (as per the press release) "to highlight fan-favorite games and hype up established indie classics as well as new IPs". It could become a yearly thing, but that'll obviously depend on how well the first showcase goes down.


According to a few of the organisers, the IIIIs - as they shall now and forever be known - reflect a high level of anxiety even among more established indie teams about finding an audience, together with a feeling that they aren't being served by existing showcases like the Geoffies, with their blockbuster headliners, celebrity cameos and extended Kojima soliloquies.

Ever the afterthought, Generals has shimmered between abandonware and temporarily available in some obscure place with no fanfare (I think? I honestly lost track) for years, but it's now available in a bundle on Steam as part of whatever needlessly awkward thing EA are doing this month. There's suddenly an opportunity to get into why its design and atmosphere make it probably my favourite of the whole collection, and why I wish I could say that without adding that it indulges in a lot of boring early-00s racism.

This isn't a formal announcement as much as a businessblast to hype shareholders, so it didn't have anything specific to say about what Gearbox are up to with their wildly popular and deeply unfunny looter shooter series. It had seemed curious that the much-delayed Borderlands movie was coming out five years after the latest main series game and with no new one in sight.

Sometimes, all it takes to get started on a great game is to come up with a compelling mechanic, and Pepper Grinder is a prime example. The titular grinder is as powerful as it is versatile, able to drill through the ground and power all sorts of wacky devices. The difficulty curve can be choppy, and ends more quickly than it should, but that core mechanic builds a sturdy foundation that kept me entertained from start to finish. 
That core mechanic is, of course, the Grinder, a conical drilling device protagonist Pepper uses to burrow through terrain, spin switches, and defeat ene…]]></summary>

We at the RPS Electronic Wireless Show podcast think this is a good thing, in broad terms, and we discuss why (but also hope Joel is allowed holidays), as well as the response the community of players has had, which is also very interesting. Plus a straw poll indicates that only one of us would enjoy be at the middle of a maelstrom of chaos and being the Helldivers GM as a job. Bet you can absolutely guess which one of us it was.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pepper Grinder is one of those games that has so many great moments in it that recounting them would almost feel unfair to anyone hoping to play it. There are feats of platforming prowess on show here that should really be experienced fresh and unsullied by rudimentary descriptions of them, because to say anymore would be to spoil the surprise. This feels doubly important when the game itself is so fleeting in length, its brief and dizzying journey through the dirt, magma, ice and marshy bogs of this strange, treasure-stuffed island coming to a swift conclusion in just over three and a half hours. It left me wanting more the moment the credits rolled, but deep down I know it's also perfectly formed just the way it is. Rather than outstay its welcome, Pepper Grinder shows up, performs its party trick, then gets the hell out of the way, leaving you to bask in the warm glow of a good game well done.

We've had a couple of successful outings over the years with the likes of Death's Door and Hollow Knight and company, but anything with pure FromSoft blood running through its veins has always left me cold. Void Sols, however, is an upcoming Soulslike that feels like it might be able to satisfy both sides of the 'git gud' camp, appealing to nervous dodge-rollers like myself while also giving hardened Elden Ringers a run for their money. It's all down to its plentiful supply of approachable customisation options, allowing you to ratchet up the difficulty if you're finding things a bit easy, or knock it down, reapply your stat points, and even create whole new loadouts - each with their own individual stat combinations - to win the day. It's all wonderfully considerate, and having played the free demo that's just launched on Steam, I'd strongly recommend giving it a go if you're feeling in need of a little training ahead of Elden Ring: Shadow Of The Erdtree coming out.

Darktide is hard when you start a new character, with weapons that barely scratch some foes and no talents to back them up. It's a challenge unlike the official high difficulty levels, which lean towards drowning you in special enemies. So after hitting level 30 on all four classes and grinding out great gear, I've started a new character who'll never learn skills or get a good gun. She's quite bad, and that's quite fun.

Once a tentpole franchise in the popular run-and-gun subgenre of action games, Contra has experienced a stark downturn in recent decades. Konami's (mostly) side-scrolling shooter franchise has often gone long stretches without a release, and the games that have come out in recent years range from middling to downright bad. With Contra: Operation Galuga, Konami taps renowned retro-style developer WayForward, best known for its work on the Shantae series, to bring the once-renowned series back to its roo…]]></summary>

I learnt this because of Doronko Wanko, a lovely free game about a dirty pomeranian where you try to score as high as possible by doing actual, financial damage to your owner’s home.

For Modern Warfare 3, there's a slew of new and remastered 6 vs 6 maps, new modes, and Zombies story additions. As for Warzone, highlights include the return of fan-favourite Rebirth Island, biometric scanners, new perks, and four new weapons. Let me break the details down for you, like how I used to break my friends' spirits by sprinting at enemies without communicating my intentions, going down, then spectating as they attempted to pick up the pieces.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stardew Valley, one of our favourite RPGs despite coming out almost a decade ago, still has an attentive steward in the form of developer Eric Barone. After the recent 1.6 mega-update to the game, which added a whole bunch of stuff, Barone (better known in his developer form as ConcernedApe) Xeeted out a list of fixes in the now-available 1.6.3 update. This makes tweaks to things arising from 1.6 (many of them addressing moss, a new foraging item) and fixes bugs, one of which was causing 'excess trash' to be fished.
Importantly, 1.6 added more pet animals to the game, and the mini-update has built in a case where if you don't have a pet by year two, for any reason, then you can adopt them from Marnie's. This is lovely.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Embracer have announced that they're selling Borderlands developers Gearbox Entertainment to Take-Two Interactive, owners of 2K Games and GTA 6 developers Rockstar, for $460 million in Take-Two shares. Three Gearbox Software studios - the flagship studio in Texas, together with Gearbox Montréal and Gearbox Quebec - will change hands as part of the deal. Take-Two will also acquire the Borderlands and Tiny Tina's Wonderlands franchises, together with Homeworld, Risk of Rain, Brothers in Arms and Duke Nukem.


Embracer will keep and rename Gearbox Publishing San Francisco, previously known as Perfect World Entertainment. They're also hanging onto Cryptic Studios, who went through a round of layoffs in November, together with their MMOs Neverwinter Online and Star Trek Online. They're also clinging onto Borderlands 3 support studio Lost Boys Interactive, who went through a round of layoffs in January, plus 3D scanning and reconstruction outfit Captured Dimensions. Last but not least, they'll keep the publishing rights to the Remnant series, Hyper Light Breaker and "other notable unannounced game releases".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In 2020, indie studio Yellow Brick Games was formed by a collection of industry veterans with experience on triple-A franchises such as Dragon Age, Assassins’ Creed, and Mass Effect. After quietly working on its first project, the team is ready to show the world what it’s been cooking up.
The studio released a brief teaser of their yet-to-be-titled first game. A press release states that this mysterious project is a fantasy action-adventure title targeting a 2025 release. We won’t find out more until April 2, when IGN will reveal the game as an IGN First. 


The studio also included two pieces of concept art, which you can view in the gallery below.

Yellow Brick Games was founded by Thomas Giroux (co-founder/CEO), Jeff Skalski (co-founder/COO), Frédéric St-Laurent B (game director), and Mike Laidlaw (chief creative officer). The team has offices in both Montreal and Quebec City and currently consists of 68 employees. The studio was founded to foster a "people first" work culture where employees' wellness takes priority while also focusing on developing titles featuring, according to their website, "deeply interactive spaces where player creativity can shine."
"We are thrilled to share this exciting news with our community. Self-publishing is a leap of faith, especially in the current turbulent industry climate, but it’s also an opportunity to take our destiny into our own hands and reach out directly to players and the wider gaming community during this release.” says Mike Laidlaw, in a press release"Our team has been hard at work for years, and we can’t wait to showcase our debut project to the world. It’s a huge milestone for us, and we see it as just the first step on what we hope will be a long and rewarding journey for the company, charting our own path, and growing our talents and products brick by brick.”]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sand Land comes from the mind of Dragon Ball creator Akira Toriyama, and despite the manga existing for over 20 years, it's never received a video game until now. Its epoynomous video game debut is a open world action RPG featuring an original story, and after fans got to try a recent public demo, we traveled to Bandai Namco to check out never-before-seen sections of the game. Join Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard as they show off a new dungeon and boss fight from Sand Land, along with peeks at Forest Land and the game's deep vehicle customization.

Apparently, the original was a dark fantasy action RPG with roguelike elements and MMO subscription models before developer Flagship Studios shut down. Then it was re-released a bunch of times, with London giving way to Tokyo in one expansion. Now, Hellgate's original creator Bill Roper has announced he's working on a brand new Hellgate game under his new studio Lunacy Games.

Horizon Forbidden West: Complete Edition succeeds where Dragon’s Dogma 2 spluttered, quietly yet capably adapting to handheld hardware. Keeping performance up requires a fair bit of fine-tuning the graphics settings, and a girthsome install size might trouble the internal drives of smaller models, but otherwise, Forbidden West is just as portable-friendly as Horizon Zero Dawn. And that’s still one of the best Steam Deck games around.

The mystery is really just a backdrop, though - a device to better bring forth the themes of family and secrets. Most specifically it's about mother-daughter relationships, as we join single mum Opal and her sixteen-year-old daughter Tess on a short (from our point of view) but bittersweet road trip when, going through Opal's mother's home post-funeral, they discover she may have had an affair decades before. Can you ever really know the people you love? Does it matter? If you left your daughter's early-00s flip phone back at the motel, would you turn around and lose four hours, or hope it's still there on the way back?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A couple of decades ago there was a period when all videogames and especially all Unreal Engine videogames had to be brown and grey and dingy. "The Gears of Warrification of graphics," we used to call it, huddled up in the chest-high trenches with our Xbox 360 controllers. Survival MMO Dune: Awakening threatens to bring that back in a big way: the novel and films on which it’s based take place, after all, on an entire planet made of sand. 


Developers Funcom have various plans for sprucing up the aesthetic, however. For one thing, parts of Awakening are set underground, where there’s actual, canonical vegetation and thus, a wider range of colours. For another, it’s possible Dune: Awakening will ultimately leave the dunes behind and whisk us away on a journey to another planet.

It looks to be a sizeable one too, with ship customisation and a “complete space station overhaul” among the new features. You can read the full patch notes here. I hope it includes a note about how much sleep they’re all getting, because I’m starting to worry.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Like the good works of Calvin Klein, these genes come pre-distressed. Geneforge 2 - Infestation is fresh from the rack, yet looks and functions like the CRPGs of the late 1990s. Where most isometric throwbacks these days offer a forced perspective over 3D scenes, Geneforge 2 is the real deal - its flat character sprites gliding across tiled backgrounds, with the elegant shuffle of Shōgun-era ladies-in-waiting.
This look is less a nostalgic affectation than it is simply practical. Geneforge 2, like all of Jeff Vogel’s games, was made in the spare bedroom of his Seattle home with the help of his wife, Mariann Krizsan - plus a handful of artists spread more broadly. It’s the latest in a long line of low-budget Spiderweb Software RPGs to achieve sprawling scale and reactivity by leaning on cost-effective and old-fashioned production values. Here there is no voice acting, nor any ambient noise that cannot be sourced from royalty-free soundbanks. In pastoral areas of the map, the impression of grazing livestock is conveyed entirely through a free sound effect called ‘Eating a rusk.wav’.

What does it take to survive as a survival sim, in these days when every other game seems to be a survival sim? What separates the fit from the extinct? If you're Palworld, the answer is gleefully borrowing and travestying monster concepts from a celebrated Nintendo series. If you're Enshrouded, it's all about having a really neat building system. And if you're Dune: Awakening, the next game from Conan Exiles developer Funcom, the trick may lie with sandworms.

Google tells me the main consensus is that stones are just smaller rocks, which sounds like a flimsy distinction to base a catchphrase on. I’m not sure when this would come up, unless maybe you were a biblical heretic trying to dunk on the people bludgeoning you to death by correcting them in some last gasp pettiness, but it still bothers me. Anyway, colony survival game First Dwarf cares not for rock, only stone, along with the wood you’ll use as the building blocks of your colonies. This is me burying the lede deeper than the mines of Moria, of course, because First Dwarf also has a tiny talking dragon companion that sits on the shoulder of the giant dwarven mech you use to swing a hammer at horrible toxic shitlizards. The dragon learnt your language by sneaking herself in a library. Do go on, game.

It'll also be a little less oppressive, aiming for a feeling of "fireside menace" - that is, "an awareness of the world's dangers, but also warmth and comfort", which certainly feels like an appropriate mood for a time of mass layoffs and game cancellations, to say nothing of recent conspiracy-fuelled harassment campaigns.

Go-gettin', arrow-shootin' warrior Aloy managed to delay the end of the world in Horizon Zero Dawn, but the death train is still chugging along to all life on Earth station via a (currently resonant) eco-disaster. In Horizon Forbidden West it's because the AI created to heal the planet from the prior extinction event caused by humans isn't working properly. Gaia, said AI, has been turned off and split into different parts, so yours and Aloy's job sequel is to, firstly, reboot Gaia, and secondly collect all these subordinate functions. But nobody turned off the making robots button, which means this action RPG in a massive open-world still involves fighting rocket-launcher T-rexes. It'll shock no one that this makes for a very good video game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following up yesterday’s news on Ghost Story Games’ upcoming Judas, courtesy of the Ian Games Network, another interview with the Friends Per Second podcast, via SkillUp on YouTube, has shed light aplenty on the upcoming Bioshock-ian FPS game. The hosts played the game for 5 hours at Ghost Story Games in Boston, then interviewed director Ken Levine. Here’s a crunchy chipstick of a take to kick things off with; Judas is, says Ralph of SkillUp, “Definitely not Bioshock in space”. I...haven't played it, have I, so I'll put my cynicism in its horrible little cage for a bit. Aesthetically, at least, Judas does look to have a lot going for it.
Not least because of the giant robot dog that takes on the role of Bioshock’s bathysphere this time around. Riding the dog sounds to involve a pixel art minigame that has you collect fuel pickups. You’ll ride the dog between the “districts” of the city-sized spaceship Mayflower. We also got a few details on what exactly those districts might entail. The hosts mention a  “birthing district” and “milk district”. Whatever you think the “milk district” might be in terms of a Bioshock-ian dystopia, it sounds like you’re probably right. The hosts made a face. I made a face. I’m sure you are also likely making a face right now.

For those not paying close attention to Korean video game news, it felt like it came out of nowhere. In the trailer, a beautiful woman is seen fighting a hybrid monster robot. She uses a sword to break off one of the cyborg creature’s arms to use as a weapon before being thrown through a wall, revealing the fight was happening on a space station all along.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you've been paying attention to our Game Gauntlet, a bracket where our readers decide the best game of all time, you might have noticed one contender has been an unstoppable force – The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. It nuked Fallout 3, omnislashed Final Fantasy VII, felled Elden Ring (without using spirit ashes), and survived the hordes of The Last of Us. Skyrim was a groundbreaking open-world adventure when it was first released, and fans clearly have plenty of love for it in the 13 years since then and now, so it's no surprise the gaming community has been clamoring for news about a sequel for years now. Luckily, we do have a minor update for fans who need something to tide them over just a little longer.
Thirty years ago, The Elder Scrolls series began with The Elder Scrolls: Arena, so Bethesda put together a little celebratory post touring through each game in the franchise. The post, which you can read in its entirety below, ends with a small section about the highly anticipated next entry.
The relevant section says, "Last but not least, yes, we are in development on the next chapter – The Elder Scrolls VI. Even now, returning to Tamriel and playing early builds has us filled with the same joy, excitement, and promise of adventure."
There's really not much to go on, but as Kotaku points out, this does confirm that the series will stay on the continent of Tamriel rather than venturing off to other areas in the fantasy world, along with the fact that the game is at least in a playable state. That said, there's no telling how far off from release it still is; the last we heard was from Microsoft's private documents that were leaked during its acquisition of Activision Blizzard, which put the release date somewhere 2026 or later.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I find myself increasingly turned off these days by simulations that boast of endless butterfly effects. I guess my misgivings can be boiled down to "a chain of dominoes is still a chain of dominoes even if it's 1000 metres in extent". Without some reason to care supplied by a narrative or broader question of theming and aesthetics, it all risks being admirable of execution but also like sheer technical maximalism - systems for the sake of systems. What do I care if I can make the 567th domino fall over by kicking the first?


Still, I'm very interested to see more of City 20. In development since 2018, it's the work of Untold Games, a studio hitherto known for VR projects, location-based "immersive experiences" and ports of games such as Journey To The Savage Planet. As a piece of mechanics, it's a top-down sandbox survival experience with a highly reactive environment and procedural storytelling, influenced by the likes of Rimworld (and not, the developers insist, created using latter-day generative AI tools). As a story scenario, meanwhile, it's inspired by Cold War conspiracy theories about Soviet "secret cities" given over to uranium enrichment and nuclear experiments. The titular City 20 is one such burg, though not a direct recreation. As the game begins, a nuclear accident has led to a radiation spike and a partial evacuation: you play one of the poor suckers who didn't make the last bus out of town.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good news for people who don’t cringe violently every time they encounter the phrase “Narrative Legos”! We’ve finally got some more details about the extremely Bioshock-adjacent Judas, courtesy of the Ian Games Network, who spent six hours playing the game and chatting to Levine at Ghost Story Games in Boston. It’s a massive interview, but very broadly, it's an FPS game that gives you guns in your right hand and “various organic powers” in your left. It’s got a big focus on story and choosing your own path through character interaction, and it also has roguelike elements. “The ship is different every time you die and come back, the ship layout can be different," says Levine. 


Judas, it turns out, is the name of the woman you’ve likely already seen in the trailers, who is also your player character. The game takes place aboard the Mayflower, a spaceship the size of a city doing that thing from Hitchhiker’s Guide with the hairdressers, only the Earth seems to have been in actual danger this time. You start the game being resurrected, or “reprinted”. You’ll then start chatting to holographic projections of the three leaders of the ship; all of which have different goals, roles, and Bioshock-ian quirks. They’re at odds with each other, and you’ll get to decide who to work with and against, hence “Narrative Legos” and “No two playthroughs ever…” yadayada, which is a phrase that seems almost quaint in terms of comparative obnoxiousness.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you’ve  read my duology on spending far too long queuing in Hitman, you’ll know I’ve a predilection for the virtual people watching of NPCs in games that have some sort of schedule system. "It’s a wholesome pursuit of game design knowledge!" I stammer, as the guards approach. "It gives me a greater appreciation for the obscure details lurking in the hidden corners of virtual cities!" I protest, as I’m clapped in chains after being caught staring through a blacksmiths window for four hours watching him eat the same heel of bread, rubbing my hands together and grinning manically. Imagine my glee, then, when an early quest in action RPG Dragon's Dogma 2 not only condoned my weird hobby, but actively encouraged it.
Alfred is bardic beggar you’ll likely first encounter by Vernworth’s city square water feature. He’s doing a spot of medieval busking, spinning some brilliantly localized rhyming yarns to whoever will listen. He also periodically asks for beer money, even if you think he’s shit, which is a great pitch. Onlookers come and go, but after listening to him gas up the nobility with tall tales for a spell, you’ll likely spot a particularly enthusiastic permanent fixture off to the side. Have a chat, and he’ll tell you he reckons there’s something fishy about Alfred. He never sees much patronage from busking, but he never seems short of coin. Follow him around for a bit and see how he makes his money, won’t you? My annoyance that I’d just given Alfred several hundred gold immediately dissipated at the prospect of some quest journal-sanctioned stalking.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While the PC release of Horizon Forbidden West: Complete Edition has effectively made my PS5 ownership pointless, I can’t stay mad at it. Besides being a sumptuous, endlessly satisfying sci-fi romp with one of the prettiest open worlds in gaming, it’s also a very respectable porting job, with stable performance that scales well on aged PC hardware all the way up to glistening 4K rigs.
There are some imperfections, but generally, this shouldn’t be a repeat of Horizon Zero Dawn’s need for a post-launch patch regimen. On all the hardware I’ve tested, Forbidden West looks good to go, especially when choosing the right settings can smooth out performance even more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Swashbuckling third-person action-RPG Flintlock: The Siege Of Dawn is, amongst other things, a gentle homage to New Zealand, developer A44 Games's country of origin. You do have to look for it, mind you. The game's art direction at large is an elegant hodgepodge of inspirations that deserves to be unpicked carefully after release.
Main character Nor Vanek - who is on a mission to massacre various escaped underworld gods - is kind of a Napoleonic superhero. Rakishly attired in braided frock coats and knee-high boots, she can use sparking "blackpowder" pistols both to inflict damage and to double-jump or dodge while performing snappily choreographed, one-handed sword and axe combos, straight out of God of War. As regards locations, there are pale medieval citadels with stained-glass windows, coffee shops run by eerie, many-armed "Hosts" that glean from the ambience of Turkish bazaars, and certain other fantastical areas and characters - including Nor's spectral fox sidekick Enki - that are influenced by ancient Mesopotamian mythology.

We got a first look at the new editor tools last October, which looks to simplify the process by combining what was previously several different separate editors into a single application. It was later available only to some closed beta testers, but is now released for everyone. Emphasis on everyone, actually, since the tool looks refreshingly approachable, even for those with basically no modding experience.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Maintaining the thrum of a finely-tuned citybuilder has to be one of the most satisfying acts of video game plate-spinning around. Nursing that constant flow of foot traffic, produce and profits, all of them teetering on a carefully honed knife-edge, that's the good stuff right there. Of course, it's not always the threat of imminent and total collapse that fuels these mighty engines of urban planning. Sometimes it's the simple pleasure of building itself, watching a scrub of dirt track rise up into an advanced superhighway of architectural wonder. The best of these more relaxed kinds of citybuilders - your Dorfromantiks and your SteamWorld Builds et al - still involve plenty of plate-spinning; it's just that they won't ever fall over if you take your eye off the ball for a moment.
Bulwark: Falconeer Chronicles sits at the citybuilding crossroads of 'relaxed' and 'something more'. It wants to be an easy-going kind of builder, as nothing fundamentally bad happens when the wheels stop turning for a moment. For the most part, you're free to build where and however you please, constructing imposing fortresses jutting out into the ocean from mere scraps of rock. But it also gets more bogged down in the minutiae of resource flow, worker management and conquest and expansion via muddy, ill-defined combat procedures than it probably should. It always feels on the precipice of becoming something bigger, bolder and more boisterous than it ever really achieves, dipping its toes into the murky waters of its lonely Ursee without truly ever getting its feet wet.

The source has confirmed that APC-deliverer Joel isn't anything but an imposter, a fake, a generous fraud. The Real Joel, it seems, isn't so brazen with his actions.

There is also a giant plushi frog, listed under 'Adjustments'. The patch notes say simply "What does he want? Does he come in peace?" which makes him sound way more sinister than I think he is, but as you can see from the screenshot, he isn't not sinister.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dawntrail, the fifth expansion for Final Fantasy XIV, is coming on July 2. The game is also getting a collector’s edition.  
The $39.99 expansion takes players to the tropical island of Yok Tural and introduces a new storyline, two new playable classes (Pictomancer and Viper), and the level cap raised to 100, among other additions. Dawntrail will be available in all versions of the game, including the newly launched Xbox editions. 
During PAX East this past weekend, FFXIV director/producer Naoki Yoshida unveiled the Dawntrail Digital Collector’s Edition and the goodies-filled physical Collector’s Box. Here’s what comes in each package: 
Collector’s Box ($155.00)

Dawntrail Special Art Box 
Expertly Crafted Viper Figure (H 9.65" x W 4.52" x D 5.90"/H 24.5cm x W 11.5cm x D 15cm)
Adventurer’s Cloth Map (16.53" x 29.52"/42cm x 75cm)
The Unending Journey Notebook (5.90" x 4.33"/15cm x 11cm)
Adventurer’s Pen Case (8.26" x 9.44"/21cm x 24cm)
Dawntrail Digital Collector’s Edition ($59.99)

In-game Item: Ark Mount 
In-game Item: Garnet Minion 
In-game Item: Chocobo Brush: Pictomancer Weapon 
While the Digital Collector's Edition and Collector's Box must be purchased separately, a bundle containing both is called the Dawntrail Collector's Edition and runs for $214.99. However, it only contains a game code for the Windows/Mac version of Dawntrail. 
Pre-orders for the standard and collector's edition items begin Tuesday, March 26, at 9 a.m. PT. Doing so at certain retailers grants the bonus in-game items: Wind-up Zidane Minion and Azeyma's Earrings.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stellar Blade, the flashy action game from ShiftUp, isn't officially out until late April, but eager players can get their hands on the game as soon as this week. A free demo hits the PlayStation Store this Friday, March 29, and will throw players headfirst into the game's opening moments. To get an idea of what that gameplay looks like, check out the demo trailer below.


Game director Hyung Tae Kim gave a deeper explanation on the PlayStation Blog. He writes, "This first stage will include the tutorial phase to help you familiarize yourself with basic combat features as you explore post-war Eidos 7, a human city now infested by the Naytiba, giving you an early grasp of gameplay mechanics that will serve you throughout the game’s story."
Stellar Blade was quietly in development over the past few years (originally known as Project EVE) before its in-depth feature during January's State of Play event. The game follows Eve, the wielder of the titular Stellar Blade, as she journeys back down to Earth to save the people there from alien and robot attacks. For more on the game, you can take a look at our four-page feature in issue 364 of Game Informer magazine.
Stellar Blade is a PS5 exclusive that launches on April 26. Its demo launches on March 29 at 7 AM PDT / 2 PM GMT.

Described as “necessary” and “proportional” by the judge, the order was made on behalf of rightsholders pursuing a private criminal prosecution.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Acolyte of the Altar, the roguelike deckbuilder with a wasteland twist from developer Black Kite Games, hits PC via Steam on March 25. Ahead of the game's launch next week, Game Informer can exclusively reveal the Acolyte of the Altar launch trailer, which features plenty of deckbuilder action and another taste of this Magic: The Gathering and Shadow of the Colossus-inspired game. 
"Journey through desolate wastelands and hunt down colossal Beasts to grow stronger and serve your chosen Patron deity," the game's description reads. 
Check out the Acolyte of the Altar launch trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, Acolyte of the Altar continues to look great (and spooky), and we're excited to try our hands at its unique style of deckbuilder. 
"Beware," the game's Steam page reads. "Beasts grow stronger during battle, allowing them to consume your creatures or counter your spells. Carve profane Gifts from these behemoths and grow stronger to serve your Patron. But serve them to what end?"
That is the question players will answer when Acolyte of the Altar hits PC via Steam on March 25, 2024. If you're interested, you can play a demo of the game on Steam right now. 
Here are some Acolyte of the Altar screenshots to enjoy in the meantime:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Velan Studios, the team behind Knockout City, has announced it is entering a reorganization that will likely result in layoffs. 
In a post to X (formerly known as Twitter), the studio's co-founders Guha and Karthik Bala revealed the team was working on a big project that an outside partner suddenly canceled. As a result, it might not be able to maintain its current team size; 46 out of 121 employees were given notice they may be laid off in the next 60 days. 
“This is a rough environment for a lot of indie studios, and like them, we are faced with some very hard choices,” Velan writes in the post. Should the worst come, Velan states it will do its best to support affected staff members. You can read the full post below.

The game earned rave reviews from most critics, including a 9 out of 10 from us. But now that it’s out in the wild, Steam players have bombarded the RPG with negative reviews due to its problematic launch performance and day-one microtransactions.
In terms of performance problems, Steam players have reported issues such as framerate drops, freezes, and crashes. Capcom has acknowledged these issues in a Steam blog post where it says, “To all those looking forward to this game, we sincerely apologize for any inconvenience,” and adds, “We are investigating/fixing critical problems such as crashes and freezing.

        <updated>2024-03-22T17:04:16.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Square Enix today revealed a new look at Final XVI: The Rising Tide, the upcoming piece of DLC scheduled to launch as part of the game's expansion pass. The new story content opens the door to an entirely new area to explore in Valisthea, but the big draw is the appearance of the Eikon Leviathan. 
Back in December, Final Fantasy XVI players were treated to the Echoes of the Fallen expansion, which took Clive and his companions to a long-abandoned tower created by the Fallen precursor civilization. The Rising Tide will further expand on the game's story, but in a new direction, focusing on Leviathan. In the new story sequence, a letter arrives to the hideaway with a request for help from the Dominant of that long-lost Eikon of Water, and the party must set out to face a new threat. We detailed some of what we learned in a preview earlier this month. 
The new trailer puts a big focus on combat sequences, giving us a good look at several fights, including Clive acting as Ifrit to battle against Leviathan as they each coast over a massive body of water. The new sights and characters offer a convincing reason to redownload that massive RPG and take Clive for one more big adventure.

        <updated>2024-03-22T15:15:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Grasshopper Manufacture announced during its summer showcase last year that its 2011 supernatural action game Shadows of the Damned is getting an encore in the form of a remaster. We now know the title of that update, along with a release window.
The newly christened Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered is coming later this year. Unfortunately, the game’s website and Steam page don’t detail exactly how the game has been enhanced from a performance standpoint. Grasshopper did release screenshots, so you’ll have to use those to discern the difference between this re-release and the original. A demo of the game is currently playable at Grasshopper’s booth at PAX East. 

Shadows of the Damned was first released for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 on June 21, 2011, and served as a collaboration between Resident Evil mastermind Shinji Mikami (who served as producer) and Grasshopper founder Goichi “Suda51” Suda (the game's writer). It stars Garcia Hotspur, a demon hunter who battles his way through the depths of the underworld to rescue his captive girlfriend, Paula. The game’s fun, over-the-shoulder shooter action combined with its irreverent, absurd humor earned it a 9.25 out of 10 in our original review and a cult following over the last 13 years. EA originally published Shadows of the Damned, and it was never ported to other platforms. Grasshopper is self-publishing the remaster. 
Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For the 17th time, ScummVM has again been accepted for the Google Summer of Code program this summer.
The program intends to bring new contributors into open source projects. In the most recent two years this has included both students and non-students as eligible candidates for participation.
Like last year, participants can apply for working on either short tasks (about 175 hours of work), or large tasks (about 350 hours of work). The coding period typically runs from start of June through August, but there is some flexibility which allows participants to have longer time frames if they are unable to work full time through the summer.
ScummVM is looking for people interested in participating in GSoC with us. A list of suggested projects can be found on this page, but we are also open to your own ideas as well. Please provide the required information in your application before submitting.
We also strongly encourage you to join our Discord server, in the #scummvm-gsoc channel. This allows you to engage with our mentors and the rest of the team, to get advice about how to get involved with the project, as well as writing your application.
Based on our previous 16 years of experience with GSoC, we have put together a Google Summer of Code miniportal to help you get started.
Looking forward to hearing from you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you don’t know me, I’m Owen Rudge, and have been involved in the online Transport Tycoon community for almost 25 years. Exactly 21 years ago, I received an ICQ message (look it up, kids) out of the blue from a guy named Ludvig Strigeus (nicknamed Ludde). “Hello, you probably don’t know me, but I’ve been working on a project to clone TTD for a while.” he said, more or less. He didn’t want to release this to the public yet, and wasn’t entirely sure what he was going to do with it. (He’d been working on it since 30th June 2002, so I guess that is technically the birthday of what would become OpenTTD…) Ludde sent me a copy of what he’d been working on, and it was very exciting indeed. It was a fully functional version of Transport Tycoon Deluxe, written in C. Admittedly incomplete at that time, it was still quite remarkable.]]></summary>
