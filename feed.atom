        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's surprise news for all EA FC 25 players ahead of early access, as EA Sports has announced an official gameplay stream for the upcoming title.


While you'll need to wait till Friday before trying out all the new content firsthand, you can get an early glimpse of what to expect. EA Sports will be going live on the game's official YouTube channel to reveal different content to viewers. Let's take a look at all critical information relevant to the stream.


EA FC 25 first gameplay stream date


The first official gameplay stream will be taking place on September 18. This is exactly two days ahead of when early access begins on PC and consoles. This stream will be vastly different from the deep dive presentations conducted earlier by EA Sports. The stream is also going to be the first instance when the mass audience will be able to view all the content inside the game, including the new Rush mode.




EA FC 25 first gameplay stream timings


Here are the official timings of the gameplay stream as revealed by EA Sports.



8 a.m. PST


11 a.m. EST


4 p.m. BST



Incidentally, EA Sports has followed a similar schedule for the earlier deep dive presentations as well. The deep dive presentations tended to be between five and ten minutes, but the official stream is expected to be longer. As of writing, EA Sports hasn't indicated the duration of the stream.


How to watch EA FC 25's first gameplay stream?


The first gameplay stream will be showcased live on the game's official YouTube channel. You can check it out by clicking here, and make sure to put on a reminder lest you forget the date and time.


Interestingly, EA Sports has used an image of the five icon stars and mentioned in the tweet that there would be special guests. There's a chance that we might be able to watch the cover stars play the game in person. So far, EA Sports has remained tight-lipped about the exact content of the stream.

You're constantly repairing corroded doors and swapping out busted engine parts with cobbled-together technology. But maybe this tinkering was a little too much. Our review praised the game for its "trunk loads of atmosphere" but called the constant need to craft stuff "laborious". If you also felt this, then good news. An update now lets you fiddle the difficulty options a generous amount, say developers Ironwood Studios, making the game easier and bringing crafting needs right down.
Buuut... if you thought the opposite - that the game wasn't hard enough - you can now tick a box that makes hitting yourself with the trunk door kill you stone dead.

In between burrito recipes and hymns to the Fujifilm X100v, this gorgeous toylike art tool's gamely turning stretches of balmy meadow into semi-ruined castles, semi-ruined villages and semi-ruined citadels. 
Dreamy and slightly haunted, it's conjured words like "bewitching" and "spellbinding" in the comments sections, too. It makes sense, really. Tiny Glade's a game about making rustic dioramas and then photographing them. It's not hard to imagine some exiled magical person might live in here among the rocks and reeds and wild heather.

Eliot's The Wasteland and Mad Max: Fury Road - a blend of influences that would typically get you kicked out of the Creative Writing Club for being simultaneously too fancy and too obvious, but the game beyond the epigraph looks pretty swish.
It's "a compact and high-density Metroidvania, with a focus on sequence-breaking and playing things out of order". It uses a square aspect display ratio calibrated to give wizened Game Boy enthusiasts the shakes, and is made up of 200 single-screen rooms that "slot into the larger puzzle-box of the world". Also, you play a thorn witch who looks a bit like 1950s Tinkerbell, with a touch of Betty Boop. Here's a trailer.

The latest update for the physics-based open world build-a-car game introduces a mountable theodolite, which lets you stitch together monorail networks you can then ride about on.
If monorails strike you as frivolous, don't worry. It's more of a Shelbyville idea. And in any case, the theodolite also lets you construct networks of pipes, power lines and rail-less tarmac roads - the ready-salted crisp of the road family. It’s a chonky expansion that, in the words of lead developer Ian MacLarty, has only “scratched the surface of where this new system could go”. I am predicting an eventual pivot into either themepark management or factory simulator.

I’m building supercomputers now, and the many manufacturers that make those are hungry.
Something is always hungry in Satisfactory, and that hunger pulls you from task to task in a near-seamless and frankly beautiful daze of ever-escalating industry. It is mesmerising and it is fearsome, and after five years of early access it’s finally complete.

There's a massive horse chestnut tree outside my flat, and whenever I walk under it they drop conkers on my head. The squirrels are clearly Maw cultists. They want to give me a concussion and choke off the supply of video game news to the Maw, which will then manifest fully and bring about an age of darkness. Well, the joke's on you, squirrels, because I used to play grass hockey as a kid and I've been hit in the head by hard round objects a million times over. How else do you explain my choice of career? Anyway, here's a curated list of PC games that are out in the next five days.

Checked for new codes! 




Slimes might seem small and easy to kill, but in Slime Slaying Simulator, you're faced with killing so many in a world packed with them that they'll become the bane of your existence. In these vast worlds, fighting slimes is a noble cause for which you're handsomely rewarded. 


While the game's name might make you think of a cheap knock-off Dragon Quest title, this Roblox game is far from it. In Slime Slaying Simulator, you're taught the basics and then are sent out into the world to kill slimes, earn new gear, and unlock new parts of the world so you can conquer the Slime Queen and many more monstrous enemies. You can even hatch friendly slimes to help tackle the bigger enemies and ensure the world is saved from a sticky, gooey en…]]></summary>

"Everybody pays too much attention to and cares too much about Metacritic scores. It's gotten to the point where there's almost a set formula – if you want to get a high Metacritic score, this is how you make the game," Suda51 told Gi.biz.

Well, we thought this might be the case. After a weekend of splatting in the Grand Festival, Nintendo has announced that Splatoon 3's "regular updates" will come to an end.
The announcement tweet was quick to clarify that just because this is the end, it doesn't mean it's the end. While we might not be seeing any more regular updates to the game, seasonal events like Splatoween, Frosty Fest, Spring Fest, and Summer Nights will still be popping up with some returning themes and Big Run, Eggstra Work, and Monthly Challenges are sticking around "for the time being" too.

In Fox's last update on Deltarune Chapters 3 and 4, he explained how the game would go on sale once Deltarune Chapter 4 was complete. While the blog post he's shared explains how all of his work on developing both of these Chapters is done, they're not finished and ready to go on sale just yet. He anticipates that Deltarune Chapter 3 will be ready for proper testing by mid-October and that he'll know more about where Deltarune Chapter 4 sits in the next update blog he posts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Italian police have tracked and shut down an illegal video game trafficking ring that was buying and selling fake retro game consoles loaded with ROMs. All the products have been destroyed as part of the bust, and those involved face serious jail time. 


As reported by the BBC, a video game trafficking ring with fake vintage consoles and games worth $55.5m has been busted by Italian police. Nine Italian nationals have been arrested in the sting and charged with trading in counterfeited goods. If they're found guilty, each member of the illegal outfit faces up to eight years in prison. Considering how popular retro games and consoles are and have been for a few years now, the punishment here seems to absolutely fit the crime. 


That's no N64

Having the Ultimate Edition should allow you to participate in Early Access, which begins on September 20. But if you check the release date, it will show as September 27. This is when the Standard Edition goes live, and not the Ultimate. Many users on the game's Steam discussion have been facing this issue, and here's how you can potentially fix the problem.


EA FC 25 Ultimate Edition wrong release date on Steam fix


For starters, I have owned FIFA 22, FIFA 23, and EA Sports FC 24 on PC. I got the copies on Steam, and they were all Ultimate Edition. I have faced the same situation previously, and this is a Steam issue in particular. The store pages actually show the of…]]></summary>

You'll meet all sorts of wonderful characters and get to experience puzzles themed around stories in more ways than you might first expect. 


When I first saw The Plucky Squire, I thought it was a platformer that took place entirely within a storybook's pages. I really did think it was a 2D game, but I was pleasantly surprised when I saw that the gameplay has so much more depth and enters the realms of 3D space for its puzzles and story. It's a game indie fans won't want to miss, and it pays to know exactly when it's going to be released. So you can clear your schedule and enjoy everything the game has to offer in one go.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Less than a week is left for EA FC 25 to be out live on early access, and you'll be able to enjoy a fresh new football video game on PC and consoles.


EA Sports has once again included an early access program for those who opt to purchase the Ultimate Edition. You can also play early if you have an EA Play membership, but the trial is available for a maximum of 10 hours. Let's take a look at when you can start playing all the game modes, including the ever-popular Ultimate Team.


EA FC 25 early access release date


The early access for EA FC 25 goes live worldwide on September 20. This year, you'll receive up to seven extra days of playtime with your Ultimate Edition ownership. You can also start playing on the same day with your EA Play membership but do remember it's locked to 10 hours. After that, you will have to make a full purchase to continue your in-game journey.




EA FC 25 early access release time


The release schedule followed by EA Sports differs for PC and console users (at least it has till EA FC 24). Console users should be able to begin their early access at local midnight timings. Xbox users will once again have the benefit of switching their region to New Zealand and accessing the game earlier.


For PC users, EA Sports has previously opted for a unified launch. Here's the timing schedule they followed last year.



Los Angeles - 9 p.m. PDT (September 19)


New York - 12 a.m. EDT (September 20)


London - 5 a.m. BST (September 20)


Berlin - 6 a.m. CST (September 20)


Tokyo - 1 p.m. JST (September 20)


Sydney - 2 p.m. AST (September 20)



Disclaimer: The timings mentioned here for PC gamers aren't confirmed. We will provide the updated timings once EA Sports makes an official announcement.


You can pre-order the Ultimate Edition if you don't want to wait till September 27 to enjoy all the content.

How to use custom rosters in NBA 2K25?


You can create custom rosters of your own by editing the default rosters. But you can't use them in modes like MyTeam or MyCareer. If you want to use custom squads outside exhibition matches, MyNBA eras are your best shot.

The BLGS series was announced during the ALGS Year 4 Split 2 Playoffs. With the ALGS Year 4 Championship taking place in Japan in 2025, there's a huge gap between the end of the last LAN and the start of the next one. That's why BLGS is being brought into the spotlight as the series to watch if you want Apex Legends esports action over several weeks while you wait. We've never had this much pro Apex Legends gameplay on display, and it feels like a great year to be a fan.

The Second Galactic War rages on, and we need to get back to strategizing about how we tackle them. 


At the time of writing, the current Major Order in Helldivers 2 tasks players with killing 100 million Warriors and 45 million Bile Spewers in Terminid planets. This shouldn't be too tricky because, as a community, we've slaughtered 100 million Terminids in just 3 hours before. However, there's a secondary element to the Major Order that's split the community down the middle, and they're not making progress on either front.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The finale of Bye Bye, Earth aired recently, but fans already have something to look forward to. Season 2 has just been confirmed and is set to premiere sometime in 2025.


The exciting announcement was accompanied by a 20-second teaser trailer, offering a brief glimpse of what’s to come.




Bye Bye, Earth is an anime adaptation of Tow Ubukata’s 2000 novel, which was re-released in a four-volume edition between 2007 and 2008. The series also inspired a manga adaptation by Ryu Asahi, serialized in Young King Ours from 2020 to 2022. The anime was co-developed by Crunchyroll, WOWOW, and Sony Pictures Entertainment Japan.


As per Anime News Network, the anime first premiered on WOWOW on July 12, 2024, and BS NTV on July 13. However, it is available globally via Crunchyroll. Crunchyroll describes the story as:


"Belle Lablac doesn’t really fit in as the only human being in a world full of anthropomorphic animals. No fangs, no fur, no scales, no claws. Lonely and eager to discover where she comes from, Belle journeys to find answers to the questions of her heart. Carrying nothing but her giant sword, the Runding, she faces a world of possibilities and pitfalls in hopes of discovering the truth."


Additionally, on September 21, 2024, a special music stream will showcase the anime’s opening and ending theme songs, with a video of Kevin Penkin’s live performance at the Rudolfinum in Prague.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I don’t know if it’s the price, the lack of PS5 exclusives, or the vertical stand you have to pay extra for, but the marketing for the PS5 Pro really hasn't been what fans needed to be convinced they should drop $700 on a new console.


Nevertheless, some trolls are releasing fake images of either invisible or straight-up worse PS5 Pro improvements, and some of our best have already fallen for them.


Even those like Youtuber Hbomberguy, known for his extensively researched and gloriously long videos, seem to have fallen prey to trolls posting fake PS5 Pro Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth screenshots in a now-deleted repost. The original post, which has now been community-noted as fake, makes use of a 2023 trailer to pass off a fake "PS5 Pro" comparison. 




And again, it's fine. So many people are so unimpressed by the prospect of the PS5 Pro that they look at the comparisons and immediately assume the worst. That all-important second thought only comes a few minutes after you've already hit retweet. 


Naturally, some are already having a laugh at the whole thing, showing comparisons hopefully too ridiculous to even fool anyone:






While some others are using this moment to hurl some poignant critique at Sony.






Right now, I think the only comparisons between games on the current PS5 and the PS5 Pro you should care about are the ones shown on Sony's official reveal video. That's because motion is important — something you don't get from screenshots — as the increase in fluidity is a very important draw here.






While I don't agree with the console's absurd pricing, I do agree with the focus on making things run at a higher framerate. This might be a hot take, but I think the games look — and have already looked for over a decade — good enough. If the PS5 Pro manages to do away with most of the choppiness that has no reason to exist in modern AAA games, then that's one thing it has done very right.

8BitDo has these sorts of things for a lot of consoles. Essentially, the mod kits are controller guts that you transplant into a normal wired GameCube controller, guts for guts. The new guts have Bluetooth in them, which means you can then connect the controller to your PC or, I don’t know, other things people connect Bluetooth controllers.

Now, for those of us who weren’t able to make it to Seattle in time for PAX West, the hoodie is up for pre-order on the Square Enix Store, costing $74.99 USD. Available in two colors, the hoodie comes complete with an image of the hidden map from the Tour Turali website:

Back when the site first launched ahead of Dawntrail, players were left hunting for all of the map pieces and some on Reddit took things to the next level, working together to piece it together in spectacular fashion. On a personal level, this image is a special memory for me because my Fiancé spent hours trying to find all of the pieces, as though the website was a game in and of itself. 


The hoodie comes in two colors, maroon and light blue. Both colors have a small ‘Tural: Board of Turalism’ motif on the chest and the FFXIV meteor logo at the top of the left sleeve.

Although the hoodies are available for pre-order now, shipping won’t begin until some point in November, so you may be waiting a little while to finally show your support for Tural and the two new Dawnservants Wuk Lamat and Koana. 


The hoodie isn’t all that’s new on the Store, either. Also available for pre-order now are the following new additions, including one item which is making a comeback:



Alpha and Omega figurines


Cait Sith Doll Plushie (with in-game Cait Sith Ears item)


Plush Moogle Pouch


Plush Cactuar Pouch


Plush Spriggan Pouch


Plush Fat Chocobo Pouch

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A duel of dual spirits.
Hello folks, we're back once again for another edition of Box Art Brawl!
Before we get started, let's take a look back at how things played out last week. We checked out the GameCube classic Pokémon Colosseum, originally released in Japan in 2003 before making its way West in 2004. All three covers were admittedly pretty similar, so the scores here were relatively even. In fact, things ended in a draw between North America and Europe, both of which scored 37% of the vote.

HAVOC fought against 20 other teams across 8 matches in the ALGS Year 4 LCQ Finals APAC-S, Apex Legends' esports series, to secure their win. This is no easy feat, especially after a grueling weekend of group stages, eliminations, and the finals at the end, which have their own rules that put everyone on a level playing field to start.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you're someone who intends to spend plenty of hours with EA FC 25's Manager Mode, this list could be of immense interest.


EA Sports has revealed plenty of ratings so far, and this includes a lot of hidden gems you could try to sign. These 20 players have the highest growth potential inside the game. In simple words, these footballers all begin as Bronze cards when you start a new career but their overall ratings could increase the most if developed properly. They might not have the highest potential ratings, but the difference between their starting and final overalls will be the highest at launch.


Complete list of top 20 hidden gems in EA FC 25 Manager 


Here's the full list of the 20 players, along with their starting and potential overall ratings.

As the starting overalls of all these players are low, you should be able to sign them for cheap. It gets even easier if you're a big club and have high amounts of starting funds. But just signing them won't be enough - you'll need to develop them over time.


Once again, remember that these are footballers with the highest growth potential and not the ones with the highest potential overalls. We will have that list ready once EA FC 25 is live on early access across all available platforms.

The fight was far more complicated than it seemed, as the developer recently explained, with some players finding ways to encode hidden messages in the checkboxes.

The world is inspired by Italian folklore, from the weather and buildings to the vibrant masks that are a core part of the gameplay, and you can play it very soon. 


The release date for Enotria: The Last Song has changed several times as the developer has hit milestones early and wanted to get the game out into the hands of fans. I think the launch of Elden Ring's Shadow of the Erdtree DLC also caused at least one push. Now, though, we have a firm date and set of times for when everybody will be able to get their hands on it.

        <updated>2024-09-14T17:17:01.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Several players have received major upgrades in their EA FC 25 ratings compared to last year, and here's the list of the top 25 names. 


All these players have improved dramatically in real-life football, and as a result, their ratings have gone up. While the improvements might not be dramatic for many, some have managed to improve their overalls by more than +10 base points. Let's take a look at which footballers have made it to the list of the top 25 and how much they have improved their ratings compared to last year. 


Complete list of EA FC 25 players with the biggest improvements

Cole Palmer has managed to get the biggest raise in overalls. From a mere 66-rated Silver common in EA FC 24, he will be Rare Gold in EA FC 25. His stunning first season at Chelsea contributed to his meteoric rise.


Both Mainoo and Wharton are two talented English midfielders who are getting all the plaudits from the fans, thanks to their exploits in the Premier League. Their base cards would be potential candidates for Premier League-based starter squads.


The forward duo of Gyokeres and Dobvyk has had splendid form in front of the goal and raised their overall ratings. It's great to see the footballers being rewarded for their real-life performances with big stat boosts.

In reality, they were being taken away due to a criminal complaint filed by Hollywood, Canal+, Apple, Amazon, and other rightsholders. Since then, the owners of Uptobox have turned to the legal system, hoping to salvage whatever they can. On Thursday, a Paris court informed the defendants that their servers will not be returned.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A classic, continued.
It’s fair to say that Gimmick! 2 was a sequel not on many people’s bingo cards before its surprise announcement in June 2024. Its 1992 predecessor, a retro gem and Sunsoft’s take on a mascot platformer, enjoys a cult reputation as one of the rarest games for the Famicom/NES owing to its limited release in Japan and, oddly enough, Sweden.
It certainly made an impression on Gothenburg-based Bitwave Games, the studio behind 2022’s Gimmick! Special Edition — a rerelease of the notoriously difficult original for modern consoles — and its unlikely sequel. Not only is the story behind the IP’s revival an interesting one, but we’re happy to report that Gimmick 2 lives up to and arguably outshines its 8-bit forbearer.

It was a big one for PlayStation news, weirdly, as we speculated on 'Switch 2' pricing after Sony revealed the £700 PS5 Pro. We also delved into Astro Bot (another non-tendo release) as we looked at the fan reaction to its Mario inspiration.

Reminds me of a Regina Spektor lyric: "Leaves become most beautiful when they're about to die". And now, inevitably whatever I write below this will be a lie, because I'll actually spend my weekend listening to old Regina Spektor songs, because she's just the best.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As written about early in the year, future Intel CPUs will be moving past the "Family 6" identification used since the mid-1990s with the P6 micro-architecture. Since then Intel has continued releasing new CPUs under "Family 6" with different model IDs while AMD has been more open to changing its Family ID every Zen generation or two. With Intel using Family 6 for so long it led to a lot of Linux kernel code just relying on Model ID comparisons for determining between Intel CPU generations and the like. Thus a lot of Intel CPU model handling reworks are needed for preparing future Intel CPU generations that will no longer be in Family 6. With Linux 6.12 it looks like that work will be wrapping up...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In V Rising, you're a fledgling vampire on a mission to become absolute bossferatu of a Gothic open world. You get a Diablo-ish combat system, the ability to shapeshift into a spider, and a whole castle to prance around in, crooning at the moon. I like this premise almost as much as I dislike the fact that V Rising is also a survival game, in which you must fell trees and master a crafting system like a common turnip farmer.


What do we hope for when our interest in a game is almost perfectly balanced by our disinterest? We hope that the developers will treat us to a free-to-play weekend, in which our perhaps-unfounded reservations might be strategically offset by the endorphin rush of not having paid any goddamn money. This, V Rising creators Stunlock have now done. The game is free to download and play on Steam from right now until Monday, 16th September at 5pm UK or 10am PST.

Despite being on our radar since its announcement last year, we have seen remarkably little of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleashed, the upcoming 3D platformer / brawler from developer A Heartful of Games and publisher Outright Games. That is until today! An all-new gameplay trailer has arrived to kick some shell and things are still looking pretty good.
Building on the first gameplay glimpse we got in July, today's new footage starts to introduce us to the game's story (as narrated by one April O'Neil). A bunch of baddie mutants are on the loose — in a Turtles game? What are the odds?? — and it's up to the heroes in a half-shell to shut them down. We can see combat aplenty and some of the basic platforming challenges too, in what appears to be both single-player and co-op modes.

It's also just been Major Updated, with new two player cooperative local and online multiplayer, various quality-of-life tweaks, new recording functionality, and a suite of gameplay changes or fixes to make Larian's eyes water.

But quantity doesn't necessarily equal quality and amongst the beat-em-up highlights, there sits a fair share of not-so-classic entries too.

The group in question are the Bureau Européen des Unions de Consommateurs, or BEUC, who represent 44 non-governmental consumer organisations from 31 countries, and have been around since 1962. They're accusing the publishers of Fortnite, EA Sports FC 24, Minecraft, Clash of Clans and others of misleading people -  specifically children - with their in-game premium currencies, and breaching European Union consumer protection laws. On a press site that summarises the results of various longer studies, they offer the below broad complaints about the practice.

As the name suggests, it's about cutting things in half - specifically food items, such as fried eggs (easy enough) and candy canes (WTF). You draw a line down each object with your mouse, then click or hit space bar to perform a slice. Then, the game calculates a percentage.  If it's bang-on or very close to 50/50, you'll pass. If not, you'll have to start over. I know: this is how entire days are wasted. Sorry.

Sony’s big PlayStation-celebrating platformer is out now on PlayStation 5 and despite some glaring omissions, it’s a delightful game worth playing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier today, Nic covered the full release of Steam Families, a feature which makes it easier for families to share a game library and for parents to manage kids' purchases and playtime on the digital storefront. It's a neat improvement over the old system.

Unfortunately I can't think about anything other than the Steam Families logo, which is pictured above and is clearly a shocked, possibly aghast face. Or so I thought at first. The more I stare at it, the more it seems to reveal.

Pirates keep jumping to new servers and if promises are kept, fans are getting sued next.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are many reasons to play and write about Arco. The Mesoamerican pixelart landscapes, for example - radiant, cloud-hung platters of land with people and buildings reduced to daubs of paint in the foreground. The fact that it's about witnessing and surviving colonial invasion, rather than the more familiar European or North American video game fantasy of searching a New World for plunder.
The ensemble storytelling, with four, successively playable characters setting their own lenses to thickly entangled themes of sorrow, vengeance and growing understanding. The sparse, expressive dialogue, each phrase carefully tucked inside its speech bubble. The music. And the little things at the level of how you move, what you do. When you pick a faraway destination on your map, your character makes the journey screen by screen, which gives you a second to lean back and be a passenger, watching the horizon, at least until you're ambushed by a giant beetle.

Then again, keeping the mystery intact may have been the point all along. "As a game director, I want to hide everything from the player", GSC’s CEO Ievgen Grygorovych had told me minutes earlier. "I'm fighting with the marketing team because they want to show as much as possible!"

According to a leaked memo, Microsoft are laying off around 650 people "to organize our business for long term success". This is the same Microsoft that parted with around 1900 employees in January, and the same Microsoft that washed their hands of around 10,000 staff in January 2023, all in the name of shoring up the business for future prosperity. That "long term success" is certainly taking its sweet time. Or at least, it is if you're one of the poor saps in the trenches of, in this case, "corporate and supporting functions".

I've never been able to perform it consistently. It's one of many moderately fiddly special attacks - written down for posterity in a tear-stained journal I keep sorrowfully beneath my pillow - which have walled me out of enjoying fighting games, much as I love thinking about them. 


That wall grows ever higher as I age and my digits turn to dust and my dreams of launching Ryu like a sack of potatoes fade into the twilight. Still, at least I can still play and have fun with shooters, right? All you have to do in shooters is press a button once to make stuff go boom. Wait, Nightmare Operator, what are you doing?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Better check those desert dunes again Caravan SandWitch, someone’s buried the lede. An open world you can explore in a few relaxed evenings? One that favours the joyous freeform sightseeing of an Elden Ring or Breath Of The Wild; where you’ll scramble up vast industrial concrete ruins on scavenging missions for inquisitive frogs, instead of being nagged by bothersome checklists?
Ok, rain check on that last point. SandWitch can’t help but eventually funnel the freedom of ambling around in your chuffy yellow van into restrictive collect-a-thons. Still, for much of its breezy runtime, this one’s a real panacea for gaming’s more bloated map-scourers. Plus, even when you are sent off to hamster-cheek scavenged components before making progress, there’s very little in this world that doesn’t feel intentional. Sidequests and storytelling crumbs are deliberately scattered throughout, and each building is a thoughtful concrete puzzle box. It is, in brief, a nice time.
You play as Sauge, a spacefarer returned to her planet of Cigalo after receiving a distress signal from her missing sister. Cigalo’s a cheery place, though economically and environmentally devastated after being exploited by an evil spacecorp named The Consortium. It’s populated by small settlements of people, some large talking frogs named the Reinetos, and the occasional friendly robot. Everything’s friendly, as it goes - even gravity itself. There’s no danger, no death, no damage from flinging yourself off the tallest building you can find. Just helping out your desert buds, upgrading your van with more gadgets to solve puzzles, or working on finding exactly where Sauge’s sister has go to.

Each person on the account will have one of two roles: adult or child. Adults can manage parental controls, set hourly or daily playtime limits, approve purchase requests, and control store access. Valve appear very proud of making it easier for parents to spend money, streamlining the “time-consuming” task of buying games for their kids.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are cold opens and there are freezing ones. Sci-fi roguelike shooter Wild Bastards doesn't start on its strongest cowboy boot. You are dumped into the middle of an interstellar chase and summarily shown the ropes. The guns feel simplistic, the arenas bare, the loot vanilla, and the entire loop of beaming down to a planet and getting into small-scale "showdowns" threatens to become stale within the first hour or so. But then you find an outlaw buddy who offers a new way to shoot human dirtbags. Then another fellow bandit. And another. By the time your spaceship is half-filled with scoundrels and weirdoes shouting at each other, the game has warmed up enough to reveal its central idea. This ain't no grand FPS campaign, nor is it quick as roguelikes go. It's a snacky shootout sim with tumbleweed towns that feels best when you savour the pre-fight suspense.

Nic, I have no interesting ways to describe mushrooms right now. I used up all the mushroom lore I've ever gleaned from real-life foraging when I wrote about Morels 2, and I spent most of that article whining about unicorns. The best I can do as regards Shroom And Gloom is to say that these Shrooms do indeed look very Gloomy, possibly because some mad human has wandered into their warren and is now stabbing and eating them.

Whoa there, pardner, save a few subgenres for the rest of us! I think that's half the New & Trending keywords on Steam in one sentence. If you're mystified, best watch the announcement trailer - it paints a clearer picture, though it does involve a startling amount of cartoon decapitation and dismemberment.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you partake of some virtual rubber-burning, you might remember Ubisoft shuttered its open world racing game The Crew in March by turning off its servers. Given that The Crew is an online-only game, that signalled its death knell… or death horn, more accurately. Then in April, they tow-trucked the game out of people's libraries and revoked their purchases.

Whenever I visit family in the States and find myself in a derelict shopping plaza or some other place affected by America's depressing sense of architectural planning and overreliance on cars, I can't help but feel a sense of dread.
Devil's Hideout, a point and click horror game made by indie dev Cosmic Void, takes place in one such abandoned American city, and manages to deliver on this sense of dread even if its eerie hellscape is rough around the edges.

All those onscreen 'Nids, yeah? And the stutterfest that was the recent preview build? Surely enough to make a Tech-Priest shed at least one oily tear.

Pretty good, actually – perhaps not to the extent that you should tackle Space Marine 2 on a crusty notebook (or, for the record, a Steam Deck), but it runs decently on minimum specs and is noticeably more stable than in that preview. The only thing that might offend your PC’s machine spirit is some quality setting weirdness, where dropping or raising the graphics options can produce inconsistent results.

I like to walk in the woods around evening time, after a hard day of writing stupid listicles about Call Of Duty. Forests are a critical preoccupation of mine, actually - check this lumpen thinkypiece I wrote about Alan Wake 2 - but they're also spaces for retreat and reflection, where I can shrug off the angst and lose myself in the spectacle of sycamores and silverbirch, arching over the path. Except. Except that sooner or later I start thinking about the roots.

That process begins with the speedy release of several fan reworkings of the trailer that use something like vanilla Minecraft graphics, rather than the original, unholy fusion of LB Photo Realism and Jack Black. This'll teach Johnny Hollywood to run his grubby hands all over our beloved Creepers, eh.

A modder has cracked open some previously disabled abilities in the official modding toolkit for Baldur's Gate 3, making it possible for folks to create their own levels or alter the game's existing environments. The toolkit (which was only made available last week) previously wouldn't let you do any of that, due to "technical constraints and platform-specific guidelines," according to developers Larian. But modders neither care nor sleep. It took them just two days to worm their way into the devkit's innards and make the impossible possible.

The Maw is ascendant during the darker months, its constellations growing visible to the naked eye. We will need a steady dosage of new PC games to keep it quiescent.

It features ship travel, combat, trade, and base building, and you can do all of it alone or with space mates. It’s got a demo, but it’s also on the cheaper end if you fancy buying into early access. Considering the pricing, I’d say it’s a real looker, too.

It's as though a toddler were actually an undersung class of special operator from a Tom Clancy shooter, rather than a wailing, hyperactive ball of tears and poop. Then again, I imagine Sam Fisher was a toddler once. Perhaps this is how he got started: escaping a smashed-up house full of roaming demon toys.

They've now published another blog post that torches the vagueness of the previous post with the righteously democratic flames of specificity. Overhauls to enemies are on the way, less-loved guns will be more effective, reworks to armor penetration and health values are on the boil, and they're taking inspiration from "player fantasies" for certain weapons and stratagems. All of these tweaks are set to go live on the 17th September, so not long to wait.

That was then and this, thankfully, is now. Byrne has tentatively returned to the project and begun sharing screens on social media.

It's a crying shame that it's not currently available to buy anywhere digitally, presumably because the rights are soaked in a gutter between EA (the original publisher) and Microsoft (who bought and closed developers Lionhead).

If you do still own a physical copy of Black & White however, you might be interested in Openblack. It's a fan-led project to create a modern, open source engine for running Black & White, and its first build was just released yesterday.

This week's new hotness is Parking Garage Rally Circuit, which is about powersliding around multi-storey car parks and is designed to look like a lost Sega Saturn game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Every time you load up Agentia you are reincarnated as a different creature. "Creature" is perhaps too narrow a word - the game's "playable characters" range from geese, microscopic life and triceratops to menhirs and small rocky islands. Each forms the heart of a diamond of delicately drawn, isometric grid terrain with a baby mobile canopy of clouds and sun. It looks like an illustration from an old botanical or geographical textbook, although the inviting emptiness around the visible area also dimly reminds  me of certain elder RPGs I used to play on Macintosh.

Specifically, it did not forget about the incorrigible evil-doers amongst you who've been gunning for some additional plot catharsis. Larian's very bestest RPG has been biding its time in the shadows while you've been busy with other games. It has lingered silently while you've been off heisting on Tatooine or getting all messed up by Golden-Eyed Beasts, waiting and watching for the perfect moment - and now, it has finally struck with an unholy new patch, which adds 13 new Evil Endings, revamped splitscreen and an official modding toolkit. Foolish summer child! It is too late to flee.

I grab the faulty power transformer without listening, and am immediately electrocuted. Worse still, I have to hammer a quick-time button to recover. This is what it is like to be Jerry, the janitor of a cheap and poorly maintained space station. Jerry is being tasked with repair work beyond his job description, learning the ins and outs of an escape pod's machinery from his co-worker via radio. This may come in handy, as the station is about to explode. Tin Can is not a new game (it came out in 2022) but it is on sale as part of Steam's space exploration fest. And I enjoy a space game that makes me panic while alarms go off everywhere.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Full disclosure: I hadn't heard of Bakeru until Graham mentioned it to me. Graham always has his hands on the video game pulse, gliding them over Xwitter or Steam or wherever and waiting for that "ker kun, ker kun" of a new Cool Thing. And that cool thing is Bakeru, described by its Steam page as "Japan-esque", but is in actual fact, very Japanese. I mean, you travel around 47 Japanese prefectures as a metamorphing tanuki who bashes evilness with his taiko drum sticks. Come on.
What I hadn't suspected was Bakeru's chops not only as a platformer, but as a means to increase your chances at success in pub quizzes. The game is a certified trivia Tardis, where you'll learn all sorts about Japanese culture as well as just like, the colour sepia being a genus of cuttlefish.

This is a fairly standard feature for a lot of blockbuster games, but in the world of Warhammer 40K there are so many mega-scale battles with pitch-perfect composition that I found it hard to resist hitting pause and taking a handful of snaps every few minutes. With a keen eye (and a beefy PC) you can capture some wonderfully violent moments.

They're claiming (via in-game broadcast) that the fleeting appearance of a weird purple blob on the map screen is actually the result of fluids leaking from the corpse of a long-dead comms technician, stranded on a server farm somewhere. Who to believe? Ah, if only we had some means of shedding light on the reports. Some way of Illuminating the situation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bear with me on this, but I adore how swordfighting works in Dune. Ubiquitous wearable sci-fi shields repel any attack that comes in too fast, so everyone has to learn this unique, overtly dance-like form of close-quarters combat where every thrust and parry is necessarily slow and considered. Picture it: careful judgments of your movements, weighing up the right time to strike, every measured jab part of a wider strategy that culminates in the kill.
MOBAs are like that. Both in the fights themselves, sort of, where probing lunges lead up to bursts of lethality, but more broadly in each match as a whole. They’re map-wide knife fights, where a thrust is a well-judged lane push and a parry a savvy item buy. At first, playing Smite 2 felt akin to watching on helplessly as my opponents repeatedly shoved their crysknives through my ribs. After 30 hours, it often still feels like that - but I am enjoying myself. Mostly. Despite Valve’s third-person elephant in the lane.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nikhil Murthy's Syphilisation is a "postcolonial 4X game", which might sound like a contradiction in terms. While approaches to 4X and grand strategy vary hugely between games, factions and players, the genre as a whole is firmly wedded to imperial conquest, both structurally and at the level of narrative aspects and set-dressing. Many 4X games are triumphal re-enactments of specific periods of colonial settlement and expansion. All of which is to say that Syphilisation is fascinating. It's a reworking of the genre which dismantles and reconstructs concepts such as diplomacy, research and production. It's also just left early access - find more details and a playthrough video below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been 13 years since the first Space Marine came out. While it wasn't outstanding in the grander landscape of gaming, enough Warhammer 40K fans seem to have cherished the escapades of bulky blue boltgunner Demetrian Titus for the action game to merit a sequel a decade later. It left its story on something of a cliffhanger, with said hero being dragged away to face untold tortures by the Inquisition, the most zealous sect of this preternaturally paranoid sci-fi universe. Today, Titus is free again. Free to stomp towards hordes of alien foes, blast them with a plasma incinerator, and shred the stragglers with a chainsaw sword. Space Marine 2 is an often-satisfying scrapper that has me  convinced of 40K's merit as a crafting ground for excellent-looking environments and creatures, even if I'm not particularly moved by the bland character of Titus and his fellow Ultramarines.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Warner Bros have released the first trailer for Vertigo and Legendary's Minecraft movie, the long-awaited or possibly, long-dreaded adaptation of Mojang's industry-straddling block-builder. Quick disclosure: I worked with Mojang and Microsoft on a book about Minecraft's first 15 years, shortly before joining Rock Paper Shotgun.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Babbdi was a game of stark and severe Brutalist aesthetics, and also, a game about playing scales with a trumpet, walljumping with a baseball bat and using a leafblower to fly. Snuck out over winter 2022, it was a sombre but delightful freebie with immense though well-hidden imagination, in which your only explicit objective was to find a way out of a small concrete city.
