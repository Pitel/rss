        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this morning, various Xbox and Microsoft documents leaked online: emails, in-development plans, internal details, and more. It's how we learned Xbox head Phil Spencer considered acquiring Nintendo and Warner Bros. Games at one point, that Xbox is planning an Xbox Series X/S refresher for next year, that it might be working on remasters of Fallout 3 and The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, and that Microsoft has plans for a next-gen hybrid console in 2028. 
The leaks were quite extensive, and after some online confusion, we learned via Bloomberg that Microsoft accidentally provided federal courts with confidential (and not redacted) documents. Following news of these leaks, Spencer has now addressed what’s happened with a brief statement on Twitter. 
We've seen the conversation around old emails and documents. It is hard to see our team's work shared in this way because so much has changed and there's so much to be excited about right now, and in the future. We will share the real plans when we are ready.
September 19, 2023
He shared that on Twitter, but The Verge has obtained a more in-depth memo sent to Xbox employees. Here it is, in full: 
Something of note, especially for those particularly excited about something that might have leaked today, is that in both the internal memo to Xbox employees and the public-facing statement posted to Twitter, Spencer says these leaked documents and email are old and plans have changed. He also says the team will share "the real plans" when ready. Now, he obviously can't say the leaked information is what's happening and must downplay it as a result, but it's also a reminder to take everything that has come to light with a grain of salt because it's very likely plans have changed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier today, a massive amount of information was leaked through documents surrounding the Microsoft-FTC case. Now, Xbox head Phil Spencer has issued a response.


In a statement made on social media, Spencer confirms the Xbox team has seen the leaks and conversation, but characterizes them as being old.

        <updated>2023-09-19T19:46:33.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Embracer Group has reportedly laid off more than 25 employees from Beamdog, according to former employees via LinkedIn, as spotted by GameDeveloper. Beamdog, the studio behind Baldur’s Gate Enhanced Edition, Neverwinter Nights Enhanced Edition, and Mythforce was acquired by Embracer’s Aspyr Media subsidiary in April 2022. 


“On Friday 26 people were laid off at Beamdog, and I unfortunately am one of them,” said former associate producer Misia Bloniarz via LinkedIn. “After 4 years at the company I look back at my time there fondly, and wish everyone the best.”


Others affected by the layoffs include former associate graphic artist Jill Hollett and former QA manager Erin McIntyre, who also confirmed their termination via LinkedIn. These layoffs are just one result of Embracer Group’s previously announced restructuring, with other studios — including Saints Row developer Volition — facing shutdowns or layoffs. In that announcement, CEO Lars Wingefors insisted on the “untapped potential” of Embracer.


“Across the group, we are now initiating multiple actions to strengthen our cash flow generation and leverage our portfolio of IPs to become a stronger company and setting out on a stable future to build even greater games to the benefit of gamers and fans across the globe,” Wingefors said. He then went on to say that, despite this action, there would be closures and layoffs in the group’s future.


This might not be the last time we’ll hear about Embracer holding layoffs or closures; earlier this month, the company was reportedly considering a sale of Borderlands developer Gearbox Entertainment, per Reuters.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bluey immediately made an impact on the child's TV scene in 2018, and the world of kids' programming has never been quite the same. Showrunner Joe Brumm created the show as a result of being tired of poor-quality kids shows flooding the market, and that ethos has served Bluey well. Throughout its three seasons (consisting of over 150 episodes) it's managed to knock its myriad storylines out of the park, and on occasion, make droves of people cry. I'm skeptical that the upcoming game project will have the same effect on folks, but a dad can dream.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The developers behind 2D platformer Hardcore Mecha have a new game on the way, and this one is taking a tactical turn. The latest from RocketPunch Games, Anomaly Collapse, is described as a turn-based roguelite strategy game. Following in-progress previews on social media, you can see what that entails below.




The trailer puts character designs on display with a dash of humor and a peek at the gameplay. Set on a "one-dimensional battlefield grid," Anomaly Collapse emphasizes making the most out of what little movement you have. You can flank, backstab, and get up close and personal with your opponents, but the key lies in "abnormalities."

Critical gains


The furry fighters on the frontlines can equip these abnormalities over the course of the game to enhance abilities. These include both active and passive effects depending on what you discover. Using them at the right time can turn the tide of battle, so it sounds like a pretty crucial component to the overall strategy.


Beyond the wrinkles that abnormalities introduce, the battlefield itself can change when you least expect it. From literally shifting planes to incoming objects and projectiles, these changes will force players to think fast. If this sounds interesting, the official Twitter has been sharing everything from character art to gameplay clips for the past year. There's currently no date in place for Anomaly Collapse, but it's on the way to PC and a Steam page is live.

Like quite a few aspiring cyberpunk megacorporations, Microsoft has been scooping up whatever companies it can to bolster its gaming division and gain an advantage over its competitors. This ran into a snag with trying to acquire Activision Blizzard, as some lawmakers have raised an eyebrow at what seems to be a growing monopoly. That purchase may be inevitable, but leaked documents show that it wasn’t Microsoft’s biggest ambition.


In a leaked 2020 email (preserved by Resetera), around the time they bought Zenimax, Phil Spencer discussed Microsoft’s hopes to buy Nintendo, Valve, and Warner Bros.’ game division. This doesn’t r…]]></summary>

I wasn't sure what to make of Ghostrunner 2 but was excited to play the demo. As much as I enjoyed the first game, I bought it on a deep sale and considered giving the sequel a similar treatment. I hadn't watched any trailers, and not for a lack of interest. There were too many other games to keep track of, and Ghostrunner 2 slipped through the cracks.


That is until now because the demo might have won me over. It was only one level, but it made a hell of an impression. If Ghostrunner 2 wasn't on my radar before, I'm keeping an eye on it now.

Were it not for Nintendo's monumentally successful Mario Kart franchise, there's a good chance that F-Zero could have become the go-to racing franchise on not just Nintendo platforms, but everywhere. It really is that good, you know.
Trading bananas and shells for pure speed and boost abilities, F-Zero — which predated Mario's karting debut by 21 months — is a much more demanding racer than Mario Kart has ever claimed to be. As such, its widespread appeal has been a tad more limited, with Nintendo struggling to find a place for the series since the GBA's Japan-only F-Zero Climax in 2004.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I never imagined ever saying this, but you can now purchase Mortal Kombat 1 — and many other new games — on QVC’s website with a massive discount. Yes, you can use this discount to acquire practically brand new games like Mortal Kombat 1 or older titles like Pokemon Shield. To take advantage of this deal, however, you’ll need to make use of a specific code at checkout.


There are actually two promo codes that you can take advantage of as of this writing. It doesn’t matter which you use — they’re both pretty decent deals, all things considered.



QVCNEW20 — This code only works if you have at least $40 total in your cart, and will take $20 off the top, so you can get one full-priced PS5 game for $49.99 (not counting shipping and necessary taxes). 


NEWQVC30 — This code only works if you have a minimum of $60 total in your cart, and will take $30 off the top, so you can get a full-priced PS5 game and a full-priced Switch game for $129.98 (not counting shipping and necessary taxes).



It should be noted that both of these codes will only work for your first order with QVC, so you won’t be able to use these limited-time deals to bulk order cheap games. But, if this is just a bad time for deals — trust me, I get it — check back with Destructoid for more game deals across the internet.

Although late and reportedly nowhere near ready, it has been given a name.

'Luckily', what appears to be the platform's web portal can be located in seconds.

The past decade of innumerable remasters has been boring enough, but remastering these two games is particularly boring. When even bother when all Bethesda have made since Oblivion is Oblivion remakes with added spacesuits or yelling? Boring. But while I think the torrent of remasters is a miserable sign of big publishers just giving up, if they're going to do it anyway: why not Morrowind?

Scumhead's Franzen - released a few days ago on Steam and Itch - has a couple of big draws, straight off the bat. Firstly and least importantly, it's free, which it really shouldn't be. Secondly and more significantly, it's one of those rare RPG miniatures that is both richly imagined and snappy, with a busy and befuddling world in which you have immediate clear motivations that escalate rapidly and breed Dire Implications. It also looks like a 16-bit Pathologic, so consider me firmly on board.

        <updated>2023-09-19T15:33:35.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ever since Unity first announced its plans for a new runtime install fee, it's been trying to put flex tape over it with clarifications and responses. Now, it looks like there may be some backpedaling on the horizon. To some extent, at least. 


According to Bloomberg journalist Jason Schreier, Unity may opt to cap its upcoming – and highly unpopular – new fees at 4%.




The report goes on to say that this would be for studios/games that are making over $1 million, and that installs won't be retroactively counted. On top of this, installs will be calculated based on a "a developer's self-reported data rather than Unity's own nebulous estimate methodology."


What's the big deal?


A week ago, Unity performed an almost impressive display of self-immolation by introducing Runtime Fees as part of its new pricing plan. The policy goes into effect on January 1, 2024, and will mean that studios that have built games through Unity will have to pay a monthly fee for every new install.


This caused an immediate outcry from the community, with developers swearing off the company and its products. While Unity did try to clarify that this fee wouldn't affect the vast majority of game companies, the announcement was met with an enormous amount of derision and backlash.


There have been previous attempts to undo some of the damage. Recently, Unity issued an apology and said it would look into "making changes to the policy." While there's been no official word yet, Schreier's report gives some indication that the company may now have finally grasped the enormity of its own public flogging.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At first glance, Lies Of P looks like a wannabe Bloodborne reskin, replacing the Gothic edges of Yarnham with a twisted version of a kid's fairytale. There are silhouettes in windows sheltering from an infection that's plagued the populace and puppets who've gone awol. Take damage and you've got a chance to recoup the costs by smacking the baddie back. There's a bit where you platform down a large well, thin planks of wood marking your descent. Survive and you might want to visit your doll-like maiden and spend your souls.
But is Lies Of P just another boring pretender to Bloodborne? No! I think it's worked with its Gothic Pinocchio theme remarkably well, and the option to snap and configure your puppet lad to your liking makes its journey feel distinct. Sure, Lies Of P might lack some of the presence of its main inspiration, and not all of its parts come together to form a cohesive whole, but the game is an undeniable must for Soulslikers who crave the dark. It's perhaps the closest any Soulslike has felt to a FromSoft game, in everything from its presentation to the cadence of your character's jog.

Bandai Namco is here with another reveal for the next entry, pairing the announcement with info on the next Closed Beta Test. You'll get a chance to play again on October 20, 2023, so read on for details and see the God Fist in action below.




Feng Wei first made his way into the Tekken series in 2005's Tekken 5. He's been playable in every subsequent entry, and now he's looking for a vengeful second shot at Leroy Smith. He suffered a major defeat at the hands of Leroy in the previous tournament. To make up for that loss, Nina Williams has offered Feng another opportunity in exchange for his support of G Corp.

Trial by combat


For those interesting in trying out Feng Wei and Tekken 8, registrations are now open for the new Closed Beta Test. 19 characters will be available during the test, including the newly-announced Feng Wei. Players will get a chance to dig into cross-platform online matches, and will be among the first to try the new Tekken Fight Lounge. 


This is essentially a lobby where players can interact, create custom avatars, set up matchmaking, and more. Among the spots you'll find within it are the Battle Area, Customization Shop, Tekken Dojo, and Beach. Tekken 3's ridiculous Tekken Ball mini-game is also back for anyone who wants to brawl dodgeball-style. 


You can check out the schedule and sign up here ahead of the test's October 20 kickoff. Tekken 8 is set to launch for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC on January 26, 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I dunno if you've heard of this game Starfield, but there's a lot of talk about it at the moment. It is a roleplaying experience where the role you play is not "Viking-ish warrior who can shout with the power of a million metal frontmen" or "wasteland wanderer downing cans of irradiated coke" but "person in space following a broadly unexciting A-plot". Much of the most interesting stuff in Starfield is on the periphery of the main story, as is the case with most Bethesda RPGs, but I find Starfield to be much less whimsical (something I won't relitigate here). As an RPG, Starfield is taking itself seriously, and sometimes this collides with the design game systems and menus.
An example of this is that you are supposed to experience the vastness of space, but cannot do so without going through a lot of loading screens. Another is that you have two sets of clothes: a spacesuit for places that are hostile and have no breathable atmosphere, and street clothes for planets that do. And NPCs keep making fun of me for wearing my spacesuit when I don't need to, and I hate them for it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Overnight, in what Edwin called an "unredacted document oopsie" related to Microsoft trying to buy ActiBlizz, two things have been revealed that interest me. Well, three. Firstly, Phil Spencer capitalises "Gaming", which I hate. Secondly, as noted in that linked story, Phil Spencer wants to buy Nintendo and, in pitying also-ran brackets, Valve, which has some of the same energy as me walking into an estate agent and demanding a six bedroom house with a new fitted kitchen and a hidden library. And thirdly, according to a release schedule from a presentation dated 2020, Bethesda and Zenimax have planned out their next few years of games in depressing MCU presentation-style. Boy, are the next couple of years going to be whelming.
As is predictable now, it is largely a list of sequels and remasters, many of them dated quite optimistically, it must be said. This document pegs Starfield for 2021, for example, and obviously that didn't happen. There are also two unnamed games on there for this year (Projects Kestrel and Platinum; 2021's Project Hibiki we know refers to the surprise-released Hi-Fi Rush) and it seems unlikely they're going to appear before the end of the year. We know The Elder Scrolls 6 isn't coming for at least another five years. They're going to remaster Oblivion (but not Morrowind, the weird cousin everyone else likes most, but whose parents aren't sure what job to give them in 2023). And they're going to make Dishonored 3. I'm excited about that! But also fearful.

While modern gaming industry leaks are commonplace (I still recall being blown away by the likes of Metal Gear Solid 2's Raiden focus that was somehow kept under wraps, which feels like forever ago - because it was!), you don't come across true bombshells too often. As a result of the Microsoft and FTC fiasco that's been going on this past year, we're now privy to new (non-redacted) court documents that possibly showcase a ton of the Xbox team's future plans. Although the FTC (via spokesperson Douglas Farrar) has gotten ahead of the situation and noted that they were "not responsible" for uploading the leaks to the court website; let's dig right in.

And not because its planets are all mostly dull, lifeless husks. It's mainly because wherever I go in the universe, I'm haunted by the fleshy spectre of a misshapen man. I'm not even talking about the adoring fan (though he does also stalk my every step, too). Rather, I'm alluding to my own in-game father, who's randomly generated face and features are so utterly horrifying to me that I do a little sick in my mouth every time I run into him. Who can blame me, honestly, when his mouth is so high it clips right through his goddamn nose?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As you've hopefully read elsewhere on here, there's been an overnight windfall of insider info about Microsoft's long-term gaming biz objectives, thanks to documents accidentally released by the US Federal Trading Commission during its court case against Microsoft's Activision-Blizzard acquisition. We've learned that Microsoft are still rather keen on buying Nintendo (and Valve), and that the company had planned out the release of Dishonored 3, an Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion remaster and a Ghostwire: Tokyo sequel during the run-up to its acquisition of ZeniMax. 


The leaked documents also include extensive internal pitch and presentation materials regarding Microsoft's first-party gaming operations all the way to 2030. We can apparently expect a mid-generation Xbox console refresh, code-named Brooklin, in 2024; more intriguing, from a PC gaming perspective, is the promise of a 2028-bound "hybrid" Xbox platform, which will centre on a "thin client" OS that runs cloud-based games on “< $99”, "consumer or handheld" devices. Oh no, it's the power of the cloud all over again.

Per usual court proceedings, various emails, documents, and more were sealed away from the public and press, but many unseen documents leaked this morning. It's how we learned Xbox head Phil Spencer considered acquiring Nintendo and Warner Bros. Games at one point, and that Microsoft is planning an Xbox Series X/S refresh with a new controller for next year. Other documents point to potential remasters of Fallout 3 and The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, alongside other games. 
More specifically, a "ZeniMax Management Forecast" document details plans for various games, including the aforementioned remasters of Fallout 3 and Oblivion, alongside a potential sequel to 2022’s Ghostwire: Tokyo and a third installment in Arkane's Dishonored series.
You can take a look at the document for yourself below (credit to Game Pass Tracker on Twitter):

September 19, 2023
As you can see, this document mentions other games we know about, like Machine Games' Indiana Jones project, 2021's Deathloop, and the recently released Starfield. 
It also mentions The Elder Scrolls VI, which we just learned will launch no earlier than 2026 and will not launch on Sony's PlayStation 5. 
It's important to note that this leaked document is over three years old, so it's safe to assume plans have changed and that this schedule likely does not represent the company's current plans.

Everyone's favourite game developer-turned-YouTuber Masahiro Sakurai is back with another entry in his Creating Games series, and his latest video once again sees Kirby's Dream Land take centre stage.
This time, Sakurai uses the classic Game Boy title to discuss the level of difficulty in video games and how it needs to be balanced so that the reward matches the risk. Kirby's Dream Land gives you extra lives, the ability to fly and a good attack range among other things which in turn reduces the game's 'essence' but increases its broad appeal — anyone can have a crack at a Kirby game, and that's the point.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Get ready for the next console generation from Xbox. Or at least, get ready for it over the next five years, as leaked information suggests that a possible "hybrid" system from Microsoft could be aiming for a 2028 release.


A recent post on Resetera (echoed by known leaker Wario64) outlines some Xbox projects that are said to be in the pipeline. As well as a series of mid-gen launches for the Xbox Series, there have been some alleged details about the next-gen platform.




It looks as though Microsoft is aiming for a console that is "capable of leveraging the combined power of the client and cloud to deliver deeper immersion and entirely new classes of game experiences." Those are certainly some words.


Some other buzzwords and phrases


As well as representing the next stage in console technology, this unannounced new Xbox is looking to be a hybrid system with "Cloud-to-Edge architecture," AI optimization, and offer a platform for "immersive app development." It also seems as though Microsoft will be aiming for next gen graphics. Dur.


We should say that this has not been confirmed by Microsoft, but it wouldn't be too far a stretch to assume that the big guns in the gaming world will be starting to think about new-gen.


This speculation comes midway through additional leaks. One of which suggests that The Elder Scrolls 6 may not arrive until 2026. It also speculates that Bethesda may be working on remasters of both Oblivion and Fallout 3.


Whatever the case may be, we should wait until Microsoft/Xbox does make an official announcement. If there is to be a mid-gen console release, then new-gen will certainly be a few years away.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you haven't been paying attention these past couple of weeks, Starfield is something of a big deal. Love it or hate it, there's no denying it's the biggest launch of this generation. The community was already releasing mods the day it released, and now someone is deciding to really hammer home the "stars" theme.


As spotted by PCGamesN, Nexus Mods user kboykboy is converting Bethesda's sci-fi RPG into something more akin to Star Wars. And by "akin," I mean they literally want to convert it into Star Wars. The Galactic Civil War era, specifically.

While you can download the mod in its current state, all that you'll notice so far is the United Colonies police force have been changed into Stormtroopers. The modder does make it clear that this is a work-in-progress, so more Star Wars-y things will be added.


I mean...it is about a war that takes place among the stars


Quite how long it will take kboykboy to transform Starfield so it's more visually in-line with George Lucas' universe cannot be said. These things do take time, but it's an interesting and ambitious project.


Although Bethesda's new release has been receiving a large amount of praise, it's not without its faults. Starfield does have its share of bugs, but given that this is a game made by the same people that brought us Skyrim and Fallout 76, this one is surprisingly held together well.


As the days and weeks go by, we're going to be seeing so many more mods for Starfield make their presence known. Maybe like The Elder Scrolls 5, there'll be Thomas the Tank Engine, but in space this time. Oh wait, that's totally a thing.

Thanks to the colossal influence of the GTA franchise, GTA 6 is one of the most anticipated games of all time, and fans have been desperate to see what Rockstar is working on. 


Last year, we got to see a bit of the upcoming project through a historic leak. The consequences of the leak were massive both for Rockstar and the leaker. For Rockstar, developers had their work prematurely shown, and the studio had to divert its resources to plugging the leak. The leaker, who goes by the alias teapotuberhacker, was eventually caught, and they are facing legal ramifications. 


Although the game was still in rough shape when it was leaked, there was plenty to be learned regarding…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[But it ain't happening.
The FTC case examining Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard, depending on your perspective, is either the gift that keeps on giving or an eye-scrapingly dull, never-ending saga. Still, you can't deny that it's turned up some tasty behind-the-scenes morsels to chew on, giving gamers a fascinating glimpse of the day-to-day correspondences and conversation topics between some of the biggest names in the gaming industry.
Today's revelations will be keeping our friends over at Pure Xbox busy for some time, and we can't imagine Microsoft's top brass is happy to have its product plans, next-gen timelines, and unannounced projects ejected into the vacuum of the internet for all to see (although let's face it, nothing on that roster of potential games is particularly groundbreaking — holy crap, they're working on another DOOM and some remasters?! Unprecedented!).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Quirky creature collector Ooblets has long been exclusive to Epic Games Store on PC, but that's about to change. The Steam page is live for Glumberland's charming game, complete with an October 5, 2023 launch date. If you've been eyeing these bizarre creatures from afar, it's almost time to get to know your fellow followbabies.


Ooblets is a game that wears its inspirations on its sleeve while doing something interesting with them. Toss in flavors like Stardew Valley and Pokémon and you start to get the idea of what kind of stew Glumberland concocted.

Cozy critters


Farming, fishing, and loads of customization options await in Ooblets, as players attempt to help the mayor save Badgetown. As the mystery unravels you'll travel through various regions. Port Forward's boardwalk and its arcades, the chilly Tippytops, and Nullwhere's swamps await adventurous players. And then, of course, there are the Ooblets themselves. You'll grow these little weirdos from seeds, have them perform tasks, and engage in a decidedly Ooblets take on combat.


In place of traditional throwdowns, Ooblets settle their differences with card-based dance battles. You'll need different items to battle each wild Ooblet, and you can also take on other citizens within Oob. Even if card games aren't your forte, these clashes still manage to be another chill aspect of a relatively relaxing game. 


Ooblets originally hit Early Access on Xbox One and Epic Games Store on July 15, 2020. The full release followed on September 1, 2022. The fact that Ooblets was first announced back in 2016 means the road to the upcoming Steam version has been a particularly long one. In addition to PC and Xbox, Ooblets is currently available on Nintendo Switch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am in control of the RPS Game Club this month, so therefore I can do whatever I want - and this time I'm delving into the world of Hypnospace Outlaw's music. No other game sounds like Hypnospace. Featuring a veritable mountain of tracks (most of which was composed by the game's creator, Jay Tholen), Hypnospace’s extensive catalogue stretches across genres both real and imaginary. While Seepage’s Nothing Left For Me is a clear pastiche of Linkin Park, Fre3zer’s Icy Girl is a purposefully poor attempt to mimic Coolpunk, a genre built upon remixes of a jingle for a discontinued soda brand. The most exciting thing about Hypnospace is that its soundtrack is so dense and complex that there's opportunity to hyperfocus on one particular area to an intense - even problematic - degree.
Enter The Chowder Man, a stetson wearing Kid Rock analogue who makes frequent appearances throughout Hypnospace. A prominent rock musician in the 80s, Erik Helman (portrayed beautifully by musician, comedian and inventor of the Rick Roll Hot Dad) is attempting a last-ditch revival after his music career flatlined, transforming him from Jagger-esque superstar to sold-out jingle writer. The Chowder Man’s in-game discography is strange and varied, spanning from glorious rock ballads to 22 second earworms about a microwavable butter-based dessert. Totalling ten tracks, I have decided that it is my duty - nay, my fate - to rank and review them in their entirety. So let us commence this spiritual journey together, my friends, into the complex mind of The Chowder Man.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[ColePowered Games has announced that their procedural detective game, Shadows of Doubt, will get its first big content update on September 25. The Cheats and Liars update will not only come with some bug fixes and quality-of-life improvements, but it will also let you investigate infidelity.


Shadows of Doubt released into Early Access this past April. It casts you as a private investigator in a randomly generated chunk of city. Beyond the simple placement of buildings, every citizen, along with their home, workplace, and routine, are generated, as are the crimes. When I reviewed it during its Early Access release, I found the game intriguing and the random generation to be rather impressive. However, it was as buggy as an abandoned brothel, and I found myself having to try and play around them.




That’s what Early Access is for, but Cheats and Liars is exactly the sort of thing I was waiting for before diving in again to see how it’s progressing. The new update will feature additional investigation jobs, a new hotel building (complete with a rooftop bar), localization improvements, and support for Nvidia DLSS.



“With a very different type of case to investigate, I hope players enjoy checking into the hotel and discovering all the new features and improvements offered by the Cheats and Liars update.”
Cole Jefferies, Developer



Shadows of Doubt is available now via Steam Early Access. The Cheats and Liars update releases on September 25, 2023.

A sizeable helping of the same, if a 2020-dated release schedule leaked as part of today's accidental FTC Microsoft court document blowout is to be believed. The document is from a July 2020 Microsoft presentation about the acquisition of ZeniMax, during the early months of the Covid pandemic - as such, it doesn't reflect Microsoft and ZeniMax's plans today, following global lockdowns and the buyout, and several of the dates are obviously bogus. Still, it's probably a good steer as to current and future Bethesda and ZeniMax projects, which may include Dishonored 3 and remasters of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion and Fallout 3.

An internal email from Xbox's Phil Spencer in 2020 has revealed that the company was (and potentially still is) considering Nintendo as a potential acquisition.
Revealed as part of a deluge of leaked, unredacted documents from the FTC Vs. Microsoft case in the United States (the original of which appears to have now been removed), the email goes into surprising detail regarding Spencer's thoughts on the acquisition, going so far as to say that "getting Nintendo would be a career moment" and that it would be "a good move for both companies".

The email was sent 6th August 2020 to Microsoft's current chief marketing officer Chris Capossela and commercial chief marketing officer Takeshi Numoto. It begins with Spencer speculating that Nintendo may be receptive to approaches, thanks to one of Microsoft's allies, San Fran investment fund ValueAct, buying up Nintendo stock and so, attempting to steer the company's board towards accepting an acquisition.

Right now, I have Clock Tower 3, Silent Hill 2: Restless Dreams (Xbox version), and Escape from Bug Island (don’t ask) sitting on my desk, waiting to be filed away and then played. I’ve dug into the depths of horror video games and found the sticky but sweet delicacies at the bottom.


It’s very hard to define what makes a “cult classic.” It’s difficult to really nail down a clear definition, so depending on your perspective, some of these might not fit. However, one criterion that I did stick to is that the game must be over 10 years old. A lot of great horror games have been released in the past decade (especially indie titles), but I don’t think you can call something a c…]]></summary>

There won't be any additional character DLC, story missions, or updates; its life as a game as a service (GaaS) is nearly over. If you have ever been interested to see what the fuss has been about, Marvel's Avengers is a part of one last fire sale where you can pick it up for only a handful of dollars. 


Marvel's Avengers: The Definitive Edition is going for the crazy low cost of $3.99 USD in multiple places. You can pick it up for that price on the PlayStation Store, Steam, and Green Man Gaming. That's 90% off for those who just love looking at percentages in sales. The Definitive Edition comes with more than 400 outfits for the heroes, along with all the DLC missions and playable characters. But keep in mind that if you want the Spider-Man DLC, you need to pick up the PlayStation version.

Why is there a fire sale for Marvel's Avengers before "the end?"


Marvel's Avengers, sadly, didn't do so hot after it launched roughly three years ago. Players were unimpressed by its grindy nature, though it did earn some praise for its combat. The game was mired in "pay-to-win" controversy, as it introduced ways to buy XP boosts in lieu of simply playing the game. Publisher Square Enix was also frustrated over the game's "lower than expected" sales, ultimately leading it to sell the developer, Crystal Dynamics, to Embracer Group in 2022.


On September 30, the Marvel's Avengers owners will officially "sunset" the game. You won't be able to purchase the game or its DLC, nor will you be able to buy credits. Owners of the game can still play its single- and multiplayer modes, and limited-time events are still planned.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mortal Kombat 1 is available now to those who want to buy in early, and alongside the Xbox Series, PS5, and PC, it's also on Nintendo Switch.. Recently released footage shows the Switch version has something more gruesome than horrific fatalities: downgraded visuals. 


Mortal Kombat 1's visuals on Switch are many steps below its counterparts, but it's a shock how bad it is. Posts have been floating around Reddit and X (Twitter) showing screenshots comparing the different versions, and the differences are nightmarish.




The downgraded textures are comparable to older console generations, but the worst part is the eyes. Reptile here has a thousand-yard stare only belonging to a man who journeyed to hell and back. It's as if every single fatality he's been forced to endure suddenly came back to him all at once.


Memes are already cropping up to further ridicule how bad the disparity is, and it's easy to see why. Comparing the PS5 and Switch versions almost feels like comparing different games, but one thing similar is the price. 




Mortal Kombat 1 costs $70 on every platform. This includes the Switch version in its current state. The saddest part is that Mortal Kombat 1 is somewhat playable on the system. 


SwitchUp's performance and tech review show about 10 minutes of gameplay where it mostly says at its 60fps target. Framerate dips and visual glitches are noticeable, but it's possible to sit down and enjoy this version if your eyes don't bleed from the visuals.




If Mortal Kombat 1 on Switch didn't cost $70, the visuals would have been somewhat easier to swallow. It's commendable that the game can run on Nintendo's handheld, but there's a point where the compromise for portability is too much.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Limited Run Games has announced that 1993’s Jurassic Park and 1994’s Rampage Edition are being added to the Jurassic Park Classic Games Collection.


Many were disappointed when the included titles were revealed for the Classic Games Collection, and they excluded the Genesis titles. Instead, the announced titles are the Game Boy, NES, and SNES versions, as well as the SNES and Game Boy versions of Jurassic Park Part 2. Considering most of those titles are not very good, it’s kind of understandable.


The Genesis versions of the games were a lot more popular. Can you guess why? It’s because you could play as a velociraptor. If you were a child in the ‘90s, there was absolutely nothing cooler than that. You could also play as Alan Grant, who has the unfortunate distinction of being neither a velociraptor nor Jeff Goldblum. The games were developed by BlueSky software, who later went on to make the Vectorman games.


Unfortunately, the Genesis Jurassic Park games aren’t that great either. Once you get over the admittedly awesome ability to control a raptor, you’re left with a rather clumsy action platformer with aggravating level design. Nonetheless, I think every game should be available on modern platforms. The addition of these two titles will add some appreciable value to the collection overall. Moreover, people who were fans of the Genesis titles and felt that the omission was a dealbreaker will probably be pleased.


Jurassic Park Classic Games Collection is coming to Xbox Series X|S, PS4, PS5, and Switch. Preorders are open for the physical versions, but no release date has been announced.

        <updated>2023-09-18T17:24:22.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following its announcement in June, a date is in place for the new take on Atari's Haunted House game. As busy as next month may be, this one is looking to carve a chilling name for itself when it launches on October 12, 2023. Developed by Orbit Studio, the Haunted House revival will be available on PlayStation 4 and 5, Xbox Series X|S, PC, and Atari VCS. 


Atari shared a new trailer that shows off more of the isometric action. Promising an "all-ages thrill ride," the latest spin on Haunted House hopes to give us something more enticing than previous revivals. Orbit Studio has thrown stealthy, roguelite gameplay into the mix with light combat. As you'll see in the video, the visuals attempt to creep along the line between cartoony and spooky.  




Grave situations


Released over 40 years ago, the original Haunted House had folks firing up their Atari 2600 to piece together a magic urn. A pair of white eyes represented the player as they traversed 24 rooms across four floors, encountering the likes of bats, ghosts, and spiders along the way. Flash forward to 2023 and we have Lyn Graves venturing into her uncle's mansion to investigate his disappearance. On the hunt for the renowned treasure hunter's whereabouts, Lyn has to free her friends and fend off frights. Those friends will also be playable, each with their own advantages.


After falling prey to a spirit, Lyn will be sent back to the mansion's entrance. That's where the rougelite elements come into play, as the floor layout and enemy arrangement shifts with each attempt. Haunted House prioritizes stealth, so staying in the shadows and setting traps is preferable to leaping straight into combat. For longtime fans of the original and Atari in general, Haunted House should have plenty of callbacks in both lore and collectibles. 


If it lets us play as disembodied eyes at some point we'll call it a proper revival.

Saying that the original PlayStation was a treasure trove of RPGs is a bit of an understatement. But even with that statement, Star Ocean: The Second Story remains a standout to many RPG fans.

This was the West’s first exposure to the Star Ocean series – and for many, the series has never reached those highs from 1998.
But Star Ocean is a series that started way back on the Super Famicom. Despite its Nintendo origins, Star Ocean has often remained adrift from Nintendo platforms. 2001’s Blue Sphere – a Game Boy Color spin-off and sequel to The Second Story – and Star Ocean: First Departure R, a remaster of a PSP title, remain the only two other games in the series to release on a Nintendo console.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With its steadfast love of imploding skulls and disintegrating ribcages, Mortal Kombat has always been the most adolescent of fighting games. Mortal Kombat 1 might be using its conspicuous numeric digit to suggest a reset or rethink of some kind, but in truth it isn't remotely concerned with reinventing its world of misfits. While part of me wishes this surface-level overhaul had been more radical, it's maybe unwise to expect that. For decades this series has embraced its love of brainless ultraviolence and childish storytelling. If Mortal Kombat 1 can be praised for anything, it is unwavering kommitment to the bit.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Even though it was announced over five years ago, it appears The Elder Scrolls 6 is still a ways off. And even then, PlayStation 5 gamers might not get a chance to play it. According to newly released court documents from the Microsoft FTC case, The Elder Scrolls 6 will be released only on Xbox and PC and is not expected until 2026 or later.


This isn't exactly shocking news, though it is disappointing on both fronts. Just last month Phil Spencer claimed The Elder Scrolls 6 was so far away that it was too early to even think about platforms. Apparently, that was just all talk though, as it looks like the decision has already been made to make it an Xbox console exclusive. The decision to give Starfield the same treatment has already yielded positive results for Microsoft. We may be headin…]]></summary>

In an attempt to ensure that Microsoft's Xbox is easily differentiated from the Switch, the company once attempted to make a shift in terminology when it comes to what constitutes a "console" — because that couldn't possibly lead to confusion, right?
In a 2019 email from Xbox's head of marketing, Aaron Greenberg (and shared to Twitter by Kotaku's @ethangach), we can see that there was a time in which Microsoft was keen to present the Nintendo Switch not as a "console", but rather as a "portable gaming device". This all spawned from Ori and the Blind Forest leaving its Xbox exclusivity and making its way over to the Nintendo console, with Microsoft, obviously, looking for a way to spin it so that its system could still appear favourable.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Often when we talk about "hype" surrounding a release, it’s in anticipation of shared cultural euphoria more than that of a great gaming experience. Either way, a great RPG game hits different. Recently, Elden Ring and Baldur's Gate 3 have both been landmarks. Not to mention the enduring sweep of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt and the Minesweeper-esque ubiquity of Skyrim. When studios get the RPG right, the end result inspires excitement and devotion in ways that feel utterly unique to the genre.
To this end I chatted to Dragon Age, Baldur’s Gate, and Mass Effect maestro Mark Darrah, some of the folks at Studio ZA/UM, and the minds behind the two definitive tomes on CRPG history: Matt Barton of Dungeons And Desktops, and Felipe Pepe of The CRPG Book. I wanted to ask these genere experts about all things choice and consequence, player freedom, and Baldur’s Gate 3’s phenomenal success. What turns a niche into a phenomenon? What goes into creating a great RPG? And what makes the genre so special to people? Turns out that last one is a big question to ask.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The first-person shooter Payday 3 is set to hit stores on September 21, with Early Access opening on September 18. Steam's storefront revealed that the game will feature Denuvo, which is an anti-tampering software meant to curb piracy. This caused some upset among fans, as the software has a bad reputation.




Players won't have to worry about it anymore, as developers have confirmed that Payday 3 no longer has Denuvo. No explanation is given for the sudden change, though nobody's complaining.

The Denuvo Dilemma


Developers use Denuvo to limit piracy. With Denuvo, cracking the game and redistributing it becomes harder. This is important during a game's launch period where it will make a good percentage of its total sales. Eventually, pirates tend to crack a game, but the idea is that by delaying this, developers can maximize sales while interest is high.  


The anti-tamper software usually isn't well-received by players, as it has been blamed for the poor performance of some games, including Tekken 7 on PC. Denuvo has denied these claims, though there are other reasons why the software is loathed. It can also leave some games unplayable, which happened in 2021 when domain issues left games such as Guardians of the Galaxy unable to launch.


With Denuvo removed, Payday 3 looks geared for a successful release. It currently sits at number 3 on Steam's top 100 chart, sitting behind Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Got 99 problems, but F-Zero ain't one.
What do you get when you take the first entry in one of Nintendo's most overlooked franchises and cram it with battle royale mechanics after nearly 20 years of dormancy? You might expect a shambling Frankenstein's monster of a game held together by nostalgia-baiting stagnancy. Instead, F-Zero 99 is a clever re-imagining that injects new life into a stone-cold classic while dodging many of the pitfalls found in Nintendo's other battle royale remixes like Mario 35 or PAC-MAN 99.
F-Zero is such an important–and impressive–game thanks in no small part to its presentation. As a launch game for the SNES, its vibey, sci-fi Mode 7 graphics helped plant Nintendo's flag in the 16-bit era as a graphical powerhouse. But F-Zero's more than just a tech demo; it's a high-adrenaline, white-knuckle racing game with some serious teeth. F-Zero 99 takes care to pay its respect to the original's tough-as-nails legacy while giving it new mechanics, to help it fit even better within the '-99' formula. After all, F-Zero has always been about speed and survival.

Notably, the game's weapon customization/crafting system somehow ended up allowing players to build mish-mashed monster-guns. A particularly egregious example, just to illustrate the ridiculousness of the bug, was to slot the Aggressive Shotgun Frame onto a grenade launcher, allowing said launcher to simultaneously fire a dozen grenades all at once.


Bungie took it all in a stride, funnily enough, allowing the gun-bonanza to last over the course of the weekend. Now, though, a new update has been pushed out to disable some weapon perks, with plans to replace them sometime down the line. Even though the fun's now over, the com…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following the release of the first game this past May, Ratalaika and Shinyuden are re-releasing the 1992 Turbografx game Kaizō Chōjin Shubibinman 2 as Cyber Citizen Shockman 2: A New Menace. This new release is out on September 22.


While most of the Kaizō Chōjin Shubibinman 2 remained exclusive to the Japanese PC-Engine, we got Kaizō Chōjin Shubibinman 2 here in the West as simply Shockman. It would later become available on Nintendo’s Virtual Console service and PS3. Interestingly, the press release implies that it was also Japan-exclusive, and doesn’t mention its previous releases. This made me fact-check initially and then re-fact-check to make sure that, yes, Kaizō Chōjin Shubibinman 2 was Shockman. Then, after that, I fact-checked a third time to make sure we were talking about the same game. I’m pretty certain this is the same game as Shockman.


Now that we’ve gotten that out of the way, Cyber Citizen Shockman 2: A New Menace makes some tweaks to the previous game by making it a lot more like Mega Man. This is even down to the bosses being fan submissions. The melee combat of the first game was left behind, but in a lot of ways, that resulted in a better game.


While previous re-releases were strict ports of the Turbografx version, this new version promises new modes and will most likely have save states and rewinding. Whether or not it has been (or needed to be) re-translated isn’t mentioned.


Cyber Citizen Shockman 2: A New Menace arrives on Switch, PS4, Xbox One, and PC on September 22, 2023. It will cost you a very reasonable $5.99 USD

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We'll likely never see a third entry in Valve's puzzle magnum opus. But that's okay, because Portal 2 is a magnificent beast that maybe doesn't need improving on. However, one way it can be improved a little bit is with virtual reality.


As spotted by DSO Gaming, modder Gistix has released an early version of their Portal 2 mod that makes the game compatible with VR headsets. You can download it right now from GitHub, with version 0.1.5 having released just a few hours ago.




It's still a work in progress, but it at least gives you a chance to take on the test chambers of Aperture Science in a more immersive environment.


GLaDOS would approve


If you don't have a VR headset, the embedded video above gives you an idea of what it would be like to play the game using one. Perhaps it's not the same as actually playing it, but it offers a glimpse into Gistix's mod.


It doesn't specify which headset in particular it's compatible with. Presumably it will work with any device you plug into your PC, so long as it meets certain requirements.


The question of whether there'll ever be a Portal 3 has been on people's minds for years now. We know that Valve has a tough time breaking out those third installments, so seeing Portal 2 in VR may be the closest thing we'll find for now.

Publisher Team17 and developer Black Salt Games have today unveiled the third free update for the sinister fishing adventure Dredge. What's more, you can reel this one in today.
The free update this time around adds some slick boat customisation so you can sail in style as well as 13 new species of creepy crustaceans — fittingly dubbed ‘craberrations’. Successfully dredging up these newbies will unlock even more customisation options for your trawler, so this seems like a good excuse to pull on your sea legs and get back out there.

In 1982, Atari released its first survival-horror game, Haunted House, on the 2600. Over 40 years on, the game is getting revived on Switch as a stealth-horror roguelite, with the studio today announcing that the fresh take on Haunted House will creep onto consoles on 12th October.
This one will see you navigating the shifting walls of a spooky mansion to investigate the disappearance of a renowned treasure hunter. You'll play as Lyn Graves (the niece of said treasure hunter) whose investigations will also see her friends swept into the creepy clutches of the house — isn't it always the way?

NetherRealm Studios has been on a real hot streak with the Mortal Kombat franchise ever since it dropped its first game, the sublime Mortal Kombat 9, all the way back in 2011. The studio has always focused on bringing a top-notch narrative experience to the table, supported by a laundry list of single-player arcade and online multiplayer modes, alongside the fantastic collectathon that is the Krypt.
Mortal Kombat 1 is a reboot of sorts for the franchise, one that continues on from Mortal Kombat 11 but also completely changes direction, giving us a new universe that threads through the series' rich lore whilst also refreshing everything from character designs to the roster and environments where you set about decapitating and exploding your foes. It's a clever move, one that feels as though it was required given how complicated things had gotten by the cataclysmic events of the last game, and it affords NetherRealm the opportunity to reintroduce some old favourite characters into the bloody fray to boot.

It's part of the surprisingly prosperous genre of "team up to complete some big unwieldy task with multiple moving parts" games, and while it hasn't yet hit the highs of Overcooked or reached the terrible depths of Barotrauma, I think the recently launched Early Access build might be worth your time. Amongst other things, it's trying for a curious blend of jolly party game and macabre theocracy work simulator. And it does have some rather swanky-looking ships.

There are asteroids in the game that, for reasons known only to gods and/or programmers, follow you from orbit to orbit, flying eerily in formation with your ship, and sometimes even accompanying you to a planet's surface. "In one of my weirdest Bethesda glitch experiences, I've got a tiny asteroid that's been following me for the past 30 hours," user ReverendRoo posted on Reddit, triggering an avalanche of comments reminiscent of UFO chasers spotting each other at a NASA open day. "I would catch a glimpse of it from time to time," wrote fattfett. "I tried to approach it but you can't. It stays away. I assumed it had a deeper meaning [toward] the endgame." Some players, like Blackdius, have multiple asteroids in tow. It seems impossible to blow them up. I've dug up a Youtube video below of one such clingy space boulder from a couple of weeks back. As you can see, it's not just a fixed background point like a screen artefact, but seems to move in response to the player's ship. Most peculiar.

Why this controversial business model has been allowed to continue for more than two decades is no longer the big question.

There are both wired and wireless versions available across multiple generations, with the wireless models normally holding a steep premium - but that's not true at the moment. 
Today, the G502 Lightspeed wireless model is down to $75 at Amazon US when you use the $20 coupon on the product page, making it 50% off MSRP. Note that this deal is only for Amazon.com, not Amazon UK or other Amazon regions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Samsung's 980 Pro NVMe SSD may not be quite as fast as the later 990 Pro, but it's still an incredibly rapid option that's often available at a more reasonable price. Samsung is currently running a money-back promotion that brings this high-end PCIe 4.0 drive down to an attractively low price in both 1TB and 2TB varieties. 
You can get £30 back on the 2TB size, bringing the price to £94, while the 1TB size offers £20 back, resulting in a final price of £52. (This cashback offer runs until 9th October 2023, for the record; see their site for more info.) These are great deals and well worth considering if you want to upgrade your PC (or even PS5) with one of the fastest SSDs on the market.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Star Wars Jedi: Survivor is a fantastic game, largely due to the fact that it does such a good job of mimicking the Star Wars cinematic style. Whether it's the rush of stars streaking past a ship going into hyperspace or the distinct hum of a lightsaber, Respawn really went all out to match the aesthetic of one of the world's biggest movie franchises. One of the most important elements in achieving that is through music, and while the Star Wars sound is iconic and well-known, a good video game score has to be more than just an imitation of what came before. The music for Jedi: Survivor was written by Stephen Barton and Gordy Haab, and when I ask them what makes a good video game soundtrack, they answer in unison.

The scientific research paper in question - uploaded in August this year, and brought to my attention by RPS contributor and apparent ant enthusiast Matt Cox - sees researchers Samuel J. Lymbery, Bruce L. Webber and Raphael K. Didham use Age of Empires 2 to study how human shaping of the environment affects the balance of power between the indigenous Australian "meat ant", or Iridomyrmex purpureus, and the Argentine ant, or Linepithema humile, who are one of the world's more invasive ant species.

Others are within acceptable levels of wonkiness for me personally. But it needs a bit of an overhaul to fix some silly design choices it's hobbled itself with.

The Radeon RX 7700 XT and Radeon RX 7800 XT graphics cards don’t just fill out a 1440p-shaped hole in AMD’s current lineup – they both, the latter in particular, make the kind of spirited attempt to get up in Nvidia’s face that previous red team GPUs simply didn’t.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the things I like best about Die Gute Fabrik's forthcoming Saltsea Chronicles is an optional feature. It's a card game, Spoils, which you can play while sojourning upon the game's islands and searching for clues about your ship's missing captain, Maja. Here's how it works: two teams of two characters take turns to play cards, moving in clockwise around a table. Players must follow the lead player's suit, and the highest-scoring card wins the trick, with four tricks comprising a round. It might sound like a straightforward competition, but different islands offer different house rules, and there are twists that reflect the game's ethic of community, mutual respect and diversity, and help animate the detail of its gently post-apocalyptic oceanic world. 
The winning card from each trick is handed to the loser, so victory is, in its way, an act of generosity. Score more than 100 points in a round, meanwhile, and the "Hoarding" rule means you must relinquish those points to the other team. As Die Gute Fabrik's CEO and creative lead Hannah Nicklin observes, this fits the anti-capitalist politics and mythology of Saltsea, in which "hoarding is sort of seen as the apocryphal cause of the flood". The Spoils tutorial menus riff on this with a cute but mildly unsettling image of a sinking ship.

With two fantastic Spider-Man games under Insomniac’s belt, Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 feels like the culmination of the 2018 game and 2020’s Miles Morales in all the best ways. At a recent preview event, I spent roughly 90 minutes swinging and gliding across its new and improved New York City, taking down scores of bad guys and even challenging the Lizard. When my session concluded, I walked away thinking one thing: The first two games swung so that this third act could soar. 
This preview contains spoilers for Spider-Man (2018) and Spider-Man: Miles Morales.

A new trailer for Final Fantasy VII Rebirth dropped last night during the Playstation State Of Play stream, and holy cow, despite feeling a bit ill and exhausted and generally not firing on all cylinders at the moment, I think I might be more pumped for this than literally any other video game on the horizon right now. Even that long-awaited PC release of Final Fantasy 16 can't quite compare to this, if you ask me, and I might even be more enthused by it than the prospect of a Switch 2. And I don't even really like Final Fantasy VII! That's how much Nomura's mad, timey-wimey game child has sunk its teeth into me. I'm mostly here just to see what mad nonsense comes Cloud's way next - and from the looks of things, it's a lot.

Fed up of waiting for a big publisher to revive a series that’s been lying dormant for decades? Simply do it yourself instead. 11 years after the release of Jet Set Radio Future, and with Sega seemingly unwilling to exhume their cult-favourite rollerblading series outside of weird crossovers with Ubisoft’s Roller Champions of all things, Team Reptile have done exactly that.
Enter Bomb Rush Cyberfunk, as authentic a sequel to Jet Set Radio as you can get. Dripping with style and oozing cool, the team have crafted a carefully observed love letter that both respects and advances the original duology in meaningful ways, while taking a step back in others.

After playing more than two hours of Assassin's Creed Mirage in developer Ubisoft Bordeaux's France-based office, I was impressed with its take on Baghdad. 
I love the open-world RPGs of the series' recent years, especially Assassin's Creed Origins and Odyssey, but I’d be lying if I said I was a fan of their respective cities. It's not that I didn't enjoy them, but they weren't memorable in the same way Assassin's Creed II’s Florence or Assassin's Creed Unity's Paris was.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[US author and artist Bill Willingham has rather dramatically announced that he is placing the Fables comicbook property in the public domain, including all Fables spin-offs and characters. This means that - pending a judgement from third-party legal experts, anyway - anyone can now create art of any kind set in the Fables universe. "What was once wholly owned by Bill Willingham is now owned by everyone, for all time," the author wrote on his Substack. "It's done, and as most experts will tell you, once done it cannot be undone. Take-backs are neither contemplated nor possible."


You might recognise Fables as the universe in which Telltale's The Wolf Among Us is set. It's a grubby noir fairytale world in which bedtime story characters like Snow White and Prince Charming live discreetly among regular humans, aka Mundies, having been driven from their homelands by a mysterious Adversary. I confess I've not read any of the original comics - I've only ever played the Telltale adaptation, which I enjoyed. I feel guilty about that in hindsight, because Willingham seems to have a pretty dim view of Telltale's work, though that's partly to do with what he considers to be his longstanding unfair treatment by Fables publisher DC Comics.

In November 2021, they launched the double whammy of rhythm runner Hextech Mayhem and turn-based RPG Ruined King, and this year alone we've already had action RPG The Mageseeker and narrative platformer Conv/rgence. As you can probably tell, they're all focused on different genres, different League heroes, and have all come from different developers - and soon they'll be joined by Song Of Nunu, the next game from Rime developers Tequila Works. 
I got to play a very small slice of it at Gamescom last month, and yep, if you've been craving another low stakes adventure that's all but guaranteed to wrench at your heartstrings and wibble your tear ducts, Song Of Nunu will almost certainly fill that Rime-shaped hole in your life when it comes to PC on November 1st.

Alongside news of Rebirth's release date, Square Enix and PlayStation also released a new and expansive trailer during today's State of Play. In it, we get our first looks at characters like Cait Sith, Vincent Valentine, and more. We also get to see The Gold Saucer, some fun minigames inspired by the visual style of Final Fantasy VII on PS1, and more of the game's open area exploration, which features ridable chocobos, vehicles, and segways.

The city has doubled in size
Web wings (which we have seen before) allow for even faster traversal
Peter Parker's old high-school is a location you can visit, as well as Miles Morales' Visions Academy
You will be able to swap between Parker Spider-Man and Morales Spider-Man almost instantly
New U.I. options and more visually interesting tasks to do around the city will, hopefully, prevent you from using the menus too much
Parker and Morales can user a friendly neighborhood Spider-Man app
Folks will make requests for Spider-Man's help. Sometimes they want a specific Spider-Man, often they don't care
There is a new fast-travel system
There are over 65 suits to unlock and wear

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, during Sony's recent State of Play livestream, we got a look at both the upcoming PSVR2 update and story DLC for the Resident Evil 4 Remake. 
The VR trailer is brief but does show the game in action. Much like the other VR port of RE4, the move brings the whole game into virtual reality. The big news is that the update is coming this winter.


More immediately, we finally got confirmation that "Separate Ways" is coming to RE4. For the uninitiated, Separate Ways was a side campaign starring, you guessed it, Ada Wong, initially released with the PlayStation 2 and all subsequent versions of the original Resident Evil 4. Separate Ways will be released next week, on September 21.
Moreover, Both Ada Wong and Albert Wesker will be made available as playable characters in the Mercenaries game mode.
For more Resident Evil 4 Remake, check out our review.
Correction: An earlier version of this story mistakenly identified "Separate Ways" as "Assignment Ada." We regret the error.]]></summary>

Today's trailer stopped short of revealing a more exact release date, though. Baby Steps was revealed during a June PlayStation State of Play earlier this year. In it, players control Nate, an "unemployed failson with nothing going for him until one day, he discovers a power he never knew he had: putting one foot in front of the other." And as you might expect, players will control Nate on his journey to discover more of the world around him.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Immortals of Aveum hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC just weeks ago. We had a great time with it, giving it an 8 out of 10 in our review. Today, developer Ascendant Studios laid off approximately 45 percent of its staff. 
Ascendant founder and CEO Bret Robbins released a statement on Twitter today, explaining the large reduction in staff. He says it was a painfully difficult decision but a necessary one following the release of Immortals of Aveum on August 22. Here’s Robbins’ statement in full:

The hearts of the Game Informer staff are with everyone affected by these layoffs and those still at the studio. 
These layoffs follow the release of Immortals of Aveum, a game we thoroughly enjoyed, on August 22. Before its launch, we went hands-on with Immortals of Aveum at Ascendant Studios and talked with the team about creating a new first-person shooter in Unreal Engine 5.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Another Code: Two Memories, or Trace Memory as it's known in North America, is a Nintendo DS game that launched on the handheld device way back in 2005. Its sequel, Another Code: R – Journey Into Lost Memories, launched on the Wii in 2009, but it never came to North America. Now, players can experience both games when Another Code: Recollection hits Switch in January. 
Another Code: Recollection is an enhanced collection of Trace Memory and Another Code: R launching on Switch on January 19, 2024. During today's Nintendo Direct, Nintendo revealed this collection of games with a new trailer showing enhanced visuals while pulling back the curtains on protagonist Ashley, who is traveling to the remote Blood Edward Island in search of her father. 
Check out the Another Code: Recollection reveal trailer for yourself below: 


After Ashley receives a letter from her father, who she believes to be dead, a chain of mysteries and visions from the past is set off, sending her to Blood Edward Island. There, Ashley must investigate her surroundings while solving puzzles to reveal the truth. Another Code: R completes Ashley's tale. In it, she journeys to Lake Juliet two years after the events of Trace Memory to uncover the hidden truth surrounding her mother. 
"This collection includes fully enhanced versions of both original games, featuring overhauled visuals, fully explorable environments, new voice acting, puzzles, music, and more," Nintendo's description of the game reads. "Optional hint and navigation systems have been added to help players new to adventure games." 
Another Code: Recollection will cost $59.99 and launch on Switch on January 19, 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dave the Diver has been one of the sleeper hits of the very busy year of video games that 2023 has been so far and continues to be. Dave the Diver hit PC earlier this year but now, developer Mintrocket has revealed the sushi restaurant management game will hit Switch next month. 
More specifically, Dave the Diver will launch on Switch on October 26, and it will do so with Switch-exclusive bonuses, but only for those who preorder.


The game will cost $19.99 on Switch and you can preorder it on the Nintendo eShop right now. You can also check out a demo of the game on Switch right now, too. Preordering the game before its release will get you a bonus skin for Dave's boat and an exclusive lamp decoration for the sushi restaurant. Mintrocket describes the boat skin as nostalgic and themed after an 8-bit visual style, whereas the lamp depicts Dave "in [a] charming retro style." 
"We're over the moon seeing and hearing the reception to our first game," Dave the Diver game director Jaeho Hwang writes in a press release. "Bringing this to the Switch community has been an important goal for us as we think the console is a home where the players will truly appreciate everything Dave the Diver has to offer." 
For the uninitiated, Dave the Diver tasks players with diving underwater to gather ingredients by day that are used to serve hungry customers at a seaside sushi restaurant at night. However, there's a mystery bubbling up from "the deepest depths of the Blue Hole, the setting that [Dave] will swim through in this incredible journey." 
Dave the Diver is currently available on PC. It hits Switch on October 26. 
While waiting for its Switch release, read Game Informer's Dave the Diver review.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Robotality and publisher Chucklefish have announced that Wargroove 2 will be released next month. More specifically, the sequel hits Switch and PC on October 5, just a few months shy of the first Wargroove's fourth anniversary. 
Chucklefish announced the Wargroove 2 release date during today's Nintendo Direct alongside a new trailer showing more of the game's beautiful pixel art and challenging turn-based combat. It also highlighted the new commanders to control, a new playable faction in Wargroove 2, and the sequel's three interweaving campaigns. 
Check out the Wargroove 2 release date trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, this new trailer reveals the Faahri Republic, which Chucklefish describes as "a nation of curious mouse-folk who have landed in Aurania on a scholarly expedition."
"What the Faahri Republic lacks in military experience, they more than make up for with academic theory," a press release reads. "Equipped with mysterious crystal technology, Commanders Lytra, Pistil, and Rhomb must work together in pursuit of information for their mysterious benefactors." 
Elsewhere in the press release, Chucklefish says Wargroove 2 features new recruits and veteran wardogs to control alongside the game's new commanders. You can supercharge those commanders with a newly updated Groove system, too. Once you're done with Wargroove 2's three campaign arcs, you can battle with or against friends in co-op and multiplayer modes, both locally and online, with up to three other players. 

Preorders for Wargroove 2 are now live on PC and Switch. On Steam and Nintendo Europe and North American eShops, you can preorder for 20% off today. The game's full price is $19.99.
Wargroove 2 hits Switch and PC next month on October 5.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Vanillaware released 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim in 2020, and it was a bit of a sleeper hit. However, this team is also behind other games like Dragon's Crown and Odin Sphere. Now, Vanillaware has announced Unicorn Overlord, a new tactical fantasy RPG, and it launches March 8 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4 as a digital-only game, and Switch.
During today's Nintendo Direct, the team announced this new game with a trailer showcasing its various characters, unique art style, and tactics gameplay. And perhaps unsurprisingly, it looks great. 
Check out the Unicorn Overlord reveal trailer for yourself below: 


Vanillaware says Unicorn Overlord combines overworld exploration with an innovative battle system that's very reminiscent of Vanillaware's combat style. In the game, you'll "traverse the vibrant world, cultivate a grand army with over 60 uniquely designed characters, and grow your renown throughout the five nations in this unique epic fantasy experience." 
In addition to a Standard Edition of Unicorn Overlord, Vanillaware will also release a Collector's Edition that includes a physical copy of the game, a premium box, a 16-bit BGM soundtrack CD that consists of two discs with 10 tracks on each, a 132-page artbook, and an original card game for Unicorn Overlord that includes 239 cards, tokens, and markers. The Collector's Edition also includes the "Atlus x Vanillaware Heraldry pack and preorder DLC, which lets you customize the Liberation Army’s flag with emblem designs from Odin Sphere, Dragon's Crown, and 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim." 
Unicorn Overlord launches on March 8, 2024, on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4 (digital only), and Switch.

Ultimate roster. 
All five Amiibo look great, as Nintendo has especially become great at making these figures compared to the first few runs of Amiibo. Nintendo announced that the Zelda and Ganondorf Amiibo for Tears of the Kingdom were coming back in June, and now we know exactly when: both hit stores on November 3. While the two figures were announced together, each will be sold individually. Each Amiibo unlocks a special fabric for your paraglider in Tears of the Kingdom and special materials and weapons for the game. 
The Xenoblade Chronicles 3 Noah and Mio Amiibo go live on January 19, 2024. These two will be released as a single set. The Noah Amiibo gets you Consul N’s Armor for Noah in-game and the Leisure Time outfits for Noah, Lanz, and Eunie. The Mio Amiibo unlocks Consul M’s Armor for Mio and Leisure Time outfits for Mio, Sena, and Taion. 
And finally, the Kingdom Hearts Sora Amiibo for Super Smash Bros. Ultimate will join the figure lineup sometime in 2024. 
While waiting to get each, read Game Informer's review of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and then read Game Informer's review of Xenoblade Chronicles 3. After that, watch the Kingdom Hearts IV reveal trailer.

Supergiant announced Hades II during The Video Game Awards 2022 last December, with plans to launch it into Early Access. This is the same strategy they took with the first Hades before its critically acclaimed 1.0 launch in 2020 on PC and Switch and 2021 on PlayStation and Xbox.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bloomberg reports that two Unity Technologies Inc. offices closed today following a "credible death threat" amidst ongoing controversy regarding a new per-install fee implemented for developers using Unity. The company also canceled a planned town hall, according to Bloomberg. 
Two days ago, Unity revealed plans to charge developers using the Unity video game engine a per-install fee that would be enacted every time a player installed their games. Developers were quick to point out issues with this per-install fee, like players' ability to install, delete, install, rinse, and repeat to cost developers money as a form of retaliation, amongst other things. Many developers publicly called for Unity to walk back these changes. While Unity has addressed some of the concerns, developers are still wary of trusting the company moving forward, with some developers signaling they might move development to completely different engines in light of this fee. 
Unity CEO John Riccitiello had plans to address company staff during a town hall this morning but instead canceled it and closed the company's Austin, Texas, and San Francisco, California, offices as a result of death threats Unity received it perceived to be credible.

The terrible beauty of that generator-based exploration and scavenging loop. That moment when you walk just a little too quickly down a corridor, and hear the awful rummaging in the walls. The agonising discovery that not only is it possible to roam with the lights out, but pretty much required, beyond a certain point. The dense burden of grasping more or less where to go, without knowing how to survive the journey - and above all else, those goddamn rats, always encountered where least convenient. Shoo! Shoo!
It's by far the most oppressive and demanding horror game I've played in recent memory, and it'll get considerably worse with the release of the Halloween update.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On paper, Final Fantasy XIV doesn’t do a very good job of encouraging fishing. FFXIV’s lead director and producer Naoki Yoshida — known as Yoshi P — wanted to create something that was "fun, but relaxing”, and there aren’t a lot of material rewards for the time you put in. You can sell the fish or break them down into other materials, but really the only reason to fish is for the sake of fishing itself. 

And yet today Final Fantasy XIV is home to a close knit fishing community of over 27,000 people. This single shared interest has spun off into many different directions, including fishing as a competitive journey, the process of building a space for the hobby itself, and even a kind of metagame. But the main thread tying these all together is the love for fishing, and the community’s central hub is actually located outside of the game - in a Discord server called Fisherman’s Horizon, lovingly nicknamed Fishcord.

"Hey y'all, just a reminder to think before you target Unity employees," senior XR product designer Javier Busto tweeted earlier today. "This morning we learned that law enforcement notified several Unity offices of credible threats. This fucking sucks."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There comes a point in every diary playthrough when the Comet of Invention meets the Cowpat of Diminishing Returns, when the Foot of Agency meets the Covert Hedgehog of Limited Design, when Fucking Around meets Finding Not Much Out. I fear we are reaching that point with the life and times of Mary Read, my Starfield character and nowadays quite accomplished space pirate, who has sworn never to land on a planet ever again. 


Immediately after conquering the Chimera in Part 2 of the Starfield No-Planet Run, I commandeered a UC Longsword II on the other side of the same system. The Longsword has proven a predator without equal, charging straight through opposing craft even when they've got several levels on me, its unforgiving autocannons forming the dominant bassline of every encounter. Frankly, it's getting repetitive, and while the obvious remedy is to plunge cackling and crying into a star system with an AI threat level in the high double digits, I doubt that will really alter the rhythms of Starfield's ship combat - it'll just mean I have to do some grinding.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[NCSoft has announced that Battle Crush, its upcoming battle royale brawler, is coming to Nintendo Switch in addition to the previously known PC and mobile release. On top of that, the company revealed that all versions will receive a closed beta test next month, complete with crossplay.
In Battle Crush, players choose a character and fight to be the strongest of a pool of 30 players as the ground collapses around them. Due to ever-encroaching waves of enemies and unique battle arenas, players must be thoughtful with their placement and strategies. The player characters, called Calixers, cover a wide range of influences, often drawing inspiration from mythological figures. Battle royale may be the main mode, but Battle Crush also offers Brawl mode, where a player chooses three Calixers to fight with on a smaller map, and Build-Up, a one-on-one mode where two players compete for a best-of-five series.
Players can sign up for Battle Crush's closed beta test, which is slated to run from October 23 through October 30 on Switch, PC, and Android. Battle Crush is currently planned to launch in spring 2024.]]></summary>

The 2020 launch of Cyberpunk 2077 was terrible. Anticipation reached a point that no reasonable game could meet. Cyberpunk could have potentially grappled with those lofty expectations, but the major problem was its technical proficiency – or lack thereof. Despite the game getting good reviews (a product of press only being given PC copies) for most players, the game crashed frequently or was riddled with bugs. The PlayStation 4 version was pulled from shelves and taken offline. The content of the game – the story, the characters, the mechanics – was barely discussed in the face of players struggling even to explore the neon-soaked streets of Night City. It was a disaster, and fingers were pointed in many directions at…]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-09-14T14:39:03.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this summer, Nintendo revealed WarioWare: Move It, a new game set in the long-running "microgame" series. Ahead of its release later this year in November, Nintendo released a new trailer for WarioWare: Move It during today's Nintendo Direct. In it, we learned more about its various microgames and what a "Form" is. 
Forms are the specific poses players must perform during microgames. You might have to squat down and flap your arms, like a chicken, to push an egg out of your virtual WarioWare: Move It avatar, for example. In these microgames, you'll need to perform the correct action while in the right form as quick as you can. And you'll need to do so quickly because Nintendo says microgames come one after another in quick succession. 
Check these WarioWare: Move It microgames out for yourself in the trailer below: 


Eslewhere in today's trailer, we learned more about WarioWare: Move It's Party Mode, which will allow up to four players to compete against each other. You might have to reach a goal without getting caught by Medusa's gaze, for example, or settle a score in an arena to be the last one posing. 
Between Party Mode and the single-player modes of WarioWare: Move It, Nintendo says there are over 200 microgames to play through. 
WarioWare: Move It hits Switch November 3.

F-Zero 99 is a battle royale version of the game, similar to other recent Switch experiments like Tetris 99 and Mario 35. Check out the reveal trailer below.


The game will take place on classic F-Zero courses with machines from the original SNES game, and as the name implies, it will support up to 99 players at once. In addition to beating the competition, you'll have to avoid running into obstacles to keep from exploding. You can also complete missions to unlock new cosmetic options to customize your machine.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this summer, Nintendo announced that Princess Peach was getting her own game. At the time, they referred to the project as Untitled Princess Peach Game but during today's Nintendo Direct, the company revealed its official name: Princess Peach Showtime! 
Princess Peach Showtime hits Switch early next year on March 22. Alongside the reveal of the game's name and its release date, Nintendo also shared new details about what to expect. Princess Peach and some Toads took a trip to the Sparkle Theater to see a play. But when the Wicked Grape and the Sour Bunch arrive, it's up to Princess Peach to save the day . 
Check it out for yourself in the Princess Peach Showtime trailer below:


Princess Peach hops onto the stage with the help of Sparkle Theater guardian Stella to take down the Sour Bunch and hopefully, their leader, Wicked Grape. To do that, Princess Peach will have to make her way through a variety of plays, transforming along the way. We see her become Swordfighter Peach, with a Muskateer-esque outfit to go with it. As Swordfighter Peach, she can use a rapier to take down the Sour Bunch and other enemies before her. But that's just one play. 
Today's trailer also revealed Princess Peach will become Detective Peach to determine who is stealing artifacts from a museum. We also see her become Patisserie Peach in an effort to find stolen desserts, and Kung Fu Peach to stop the Sour Bunch from taking over a martial arts school. 

This was just a taste of the transformations that await in Princess Peach Showtime, too. 
Princess Peach Showtime hits Switch on March 22, 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Splatoon 3 entered the Switch's library with a splash last year, but Nintendo isn't done supporting the squid-based shooter just yet. Today, we got a new look at wave 2 of the game's expansion pack, titled Side Order. You can watch the trailer below.


The trailer takes place at the foot of the Spire of Order, a new location largely devoid of color. We see the return of Agent 8, the protagonist from Splatoon 2's Octo Expansion interact with a new character named Acht (which is notably German for the word "eight"), who claims to go "way back" with Marina, one of the hosts of Splatoon 2. Meanwhile, Pearl, her co-host, seems to be embodying a robot that accompanies Agent 8 throughout the world.
Acht gives Agent 8 color chips that modify their abilities, like increasing certain damage types or boosting run speed. After the trailer, Takahashi mentioned that the DLC was designed to be played "over and over again," possibly implying the game will have roguelike elements. You can check it out yourself when Side Order hits the eShop in spring 2024.

I actually wrote about Deathbulge in a round up of best demos in a Steam Next Fest back in 2020, at which time I enjoyed the RPG antics of a band entering a cursed Battle Of The Bands competition and finding out that it's a fight to the death. The full thing came out a month ago without my noticing, and got past the endpoint of the demo. It's fun! I'm enjoying the combat, which is both real-time and turn-based, and has some surprisingly deep tactics attached to it. But more importantly, the full Deathbulge game starts in a town where you enter houses by kicking doors in.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When the Lenovo Legion Go revealed itself, I was unconvinced by its portability credentials but enticed by the wireless mouse transmogrification of its detachable, Nintendo Switch-like controllers. A sparkling sliver of Swiss Army handheld design, providing a familiar taste of desktop play that the Steam Deck or Asus ROG Ally could never achieve without a USB dock.
Turns out, now that I’ve tried the Legion Go for myself, I was worried about the wrong thing. It’s nowhere near as heavy or cumbersome as it looks, and while the breakaway controls remain an exciting prospect, they also risk introducing an acute pain point. At the very least, the model I tested proved highly vulnerable to lead-handed RPS hardware editors, because I left the building very much with the impression that I’d broken it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As gaming at large gorges itself on a feast of fantastic titles, PCVR crawls beneath the table licking up the crumbs. There are tasty treats simmering in the kitchen, like the remake of The 7th Guest and sequels to I Expect You To Die and Arizona Sunshine, but right now all the fine dining is happening on Quest and PSVR2, covering which would involve running my thumb under RPS' hermetic PC seal.


In my desperation, I've turned to golf, something I would never consider under normal circumstances. I feel about golf the same way I feel about the UK Conservative party, insofar as both occupy space that would be better filled with trees. But I haven't gone totally tartan slacks. We're only entering the realm of minigolf, which I am more positively inclined toward. It lacks the pretensions and exclusionary nature of its bigger, paunchier cousin. Anybody can rock up to a minigolf course with a putter and nobody will sneer at you for being shit at it. It's also small and inherently naff, traits I can likewise relate to.

The company will only make developers pay extra for the first installation of a game on a new device - so no fees for reinstallations, in theory, and no prospect of spiteful players "install bombing" games to drive up costs for their creators. However, the company haven't stated how or indeed, if they can distinguish legitimate from illegitimate installations in advance, seemingly because their method for tracking installations is based on "estimates" using a proprietary data-gathering system, which they aren't able to discuss in depth.

Minecraft! After a month reporting on the barren planets of Starfield and plundering the rather more involving dungeons of Baldur's Gate 3, it's almost steadying to remember that these supposed titans are but momentary flickers, transient particles in the sunken Creeper eyesocket of Mojang's behemoth. And what a time to rediscover the game. Vanilla Minecraft has always felt like an autumnal creation to me, even before they added all the pumpkin heads - a game of long nights and campfires, with an ambience derived from Tove Jansson's Moomin books. Anyway, here's the teaser trailer for Minecraft Live.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There’s something that feels oddly momentous about sending one of Dune: Spice Wars’ harvesters to get to work worm-dodging while hoovering up MSG (magical space glitter). It was, after all, Dune II’s implementation of these trucks that are largely responsible for the shape of the entire RTS genre. I’ve mused before that if you count Alien as something that wouldn’t exist without Dune, along with the effects the RTS had on esports, it's wild to consider how different gaming could have been if Frank Herbert hadn’t visited Florence in 1957 to chronicle a natural phenomenon. It’s one heck of a butterfly effect, which is fitting, because Spice Wars itself can often feel like a creative exploration of how integral butterfly effects are to grand strategy rulesets. Forget those harvesters for a moment, because this dry but undeniably captivating 4X is all about the steamroll.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You can’t fault the pitch. In Gunbrella you’re a sort of cowboy dude with a shotgun that’s also an umbrella. You use the umbrella to deflect enemy projectiles, block attacks, fly up into the air like a furious Mary Poppins and zoom along ziplines. You use the shotgun, as you might reasonably expect, to do the majority of your big murdering.


Gunbrella is a classic 2D platform shooter in the style of a steampunk western. It’s like Deadwood crossed with Singin’ In The Rain, if Gene Kelly ever used his umbrella to blow holes through anyone who didn’t sufficiently praise his tap dancing. Some light exploration bits have you travelling by train from frontier towns to mining villages, much of them decorated with giant spinning cogs – so you know it’s steampunk – and populated by a small cast of quest-giving locals, pill-dispensing shopkeepers and monologuing villains.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of my favourite TV shows is The Rookie, because you never have any idea what could happen next. No episode can go more than five minutes without some kind of twist, often with no relation to anything that has happened up until that point. Like, you think the stand-off between criminals and their victims in a courthouse nuclear bunker has been resolved, but it turns out that while the camera was off him, a lawyer got stabbed by someone else. Hauma is bringing that kind of energy to the visual novel space. 
You play as Judith, a former detective and champion boxer who's wrapped up in solving the case her grandfather was working on before he died. On its face, Hauma is therefore a detective game in a pretty cool 2D comic book-style, with a slightly worse version of the Frogwares Sherlock Holmes mind palace as your inventory of clues, which you combine to logic your way through puzzles. But at the point where you're in a tunnel under the ruins of a Nazi temple in Munich, having discovered that the MacGuffin is a shin bone carved with the recipe for an eternal life drink (which was stolen by some nuns and taken to Bavaria, and then the nuns all got pregnant I guess?) - and, secondly, having recently survived a massive explosion at an Oktoberfest beer tent - you kind of think, well, things have gotten quite out of hand, haven't they?

Lies of P developer Neowiz proudly calls its The Adventures of Pinocchio-inspired action game a Soulslike, drawing direct attention to its From Software inspiration. The proclamation is a bold and risky move. While there are great contenders in this action subgenre, even the best are a few marks from what From Software creates and I went into Lies of P with that expectation.

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2023/09/13/nintendo-direct-announced-for-tomorrow-with-40-minutes-of-games-coming-this-winter"/>
        <updated>2023-09-13T14:03:56.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo has consistently been a fan of airing Nintendo Directs during September, with the usual September Directs being some of the most exciting of the year. And the company will continue that streak in 2023 as it has announced a Nintendo Direct will air tomorrow, September 14.
The company revealed this on Twitter today, stating that the direct will run for "roughly 40" minutes at 7 a.m. PT/10 a.m. ET on September 14. 
Tune in on Sept. 14 at 7 a.m. PT for a #NintendoDirect livestream featuring roughly 40 minutes of information focused on #NintendoSwitch games releasing this winter.
https://t.co/tUb8vyZNfx pic.twitter.com/WJcQ5ZQl1b
September 13, 2023
As for what to expect, there's a lot of unknowns circling this Direct. Super Mario Bros. Wonder is the big upcoming release from Nintendo, but that just got its own dedicated direct last month. That's the same direct where we learned Nintendo was releasing a new Mario Red OLED Switch, too. 
Detective Pikachu Returns is another big Switch exclusive releasing next month, and it's likely we'll see more of it during this Direct. We just went hands-on with it last week and you can read our impressions of that here. There's plenty more coming to Switch in the last few months of 2023, too, but admittedly, exclusives are sparse. September Directs from Nintendo usually give players a look ahead at the next year so we're hoping to learn more about the company's 2024 plans. Considering "this winter" dips into next year, it seems we will learn more about the early months of 2024.
On that note, Nintendo reportedly demoed the Switch successor to developers at Gamescom last month, and other reports indicate this new console will be portable like the Switch and is targeting a release in the second half of 2024. Perhaps we'll learn about it during this Direct. Only time will tell. 
This Nintendo Direct will air at 7 a.m. PT/10 a.m. ET and will run for roughly 40 minutes. 
What do you hope to see from this Nintendo Direct? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

It's probably because we're spending too much time with our favourite guilty pleasure games, which is the subject of this latest Ask RPS column.  
The question comes courtesy of ronzilla, who asked: What were your favourite guilty pleasure games of 2022? As in, I play this all the time and I'm semi-embarrassed to admit it? 
A good question! In canvassing the wider RPS Treehouse for their responses, it quickly became clear that most of our guilty pleasure games extend way beyond the bounds of just the year 2022, so we've answered a bit more broadly than the original question perhaps intended. Still, hopefully there are still some entertaining answers in here nonetheless.

A few teams have also announced plans to dump Unity and move their projects to other game engines, such as Godot or Unreal.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The internet isn’t fun anymore. Actually, that statement isn’t severe enough to reflect how bad the internet is these days, so let me try that again: being online in 2023 is a fucking nightmare. There are only three websites. They are all designed to make you angry because it’s the most profitable emotion. Your aunt was indoctrinated into fascism by a page called “This country used to have real bin men” after she liked a meme about glass milk bottles in 2012. Every boy you went to school with has a podcast about football now. Your Mam once warned you about spending too much time on the computer but now spends eight hours a day playing Hay Day on her phone. AI was meant to let us lie in fields and read books, but instead it’s being used to show you what Breaking Bad would have looked like as an anime.
But it didn’t used to be like this! Obviously I don’t need to remind our regular readers about the glory days of the information superhighway because some of you are old enough to be my Dad (and I’m thirty-one) but just in case a member of Gen Z has stumbled upon this article by accident: the internet used to be fun. Like, really fun, and Hypnospace Outlaw is living proof of it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple held a special keynote event today to reveal the iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max, new Apple Watches, and more. While new iPhones aren’t exactly surprising given the company's annual cadence, what is surprising is that Apple has also announced that Resident Evil 4 (Remake), Resident Evil Village, Assassin's Creed Mirage, and Death Stranding are coming to the iPhone 15 Pro and the iPhone 15 Pro Max, as reported by IGN. 

While details were sparse, Apple showed a few screens of the games on a virtual version of the iPhone 15 Pro during today's event, stopping short of showing gameplay of these games running on the newly announced phones. It's unclear what the gameplay experiences for these games will be like on the iPhone 15 Pro and Max; considering it's already possible to connect a Bluetooth controller, like the PlayStation DualSense or Xbox Series X/S gamepad, to various Apple devices, it's not a stretch to assume that’s the best way to play these games on this new device. 
As for how these games run on the devices, that remains to be seen. Apple says both Resident Evil games and Death Stranding will be available on the phones later this year, while Assassin's Creed Mirage hits the devices in the first half of 2024, according to IGN.
Resident Evil 4 Remake launched earlier this year, while Capcom released Resident Evil Village in 2021. Assassin's Creed Mirage is Game Informer's current cover story game, with an exclusive coverage hub as well, and the latest entry in this long-running franchise hits PlayStation, Xbox, and PC on October 5.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft has announced a new Xbox Series X/S controller with a deep purple color scheme on the front and a bright white back. Aptly, this new controller is titled "Astral Purple." It looks great and is available for preorder now before its September 19 release date. 
Xbox says, "This rich purple color has a distinct regal look to spice up your gaming setup and bolster your collection," noting that the dark purple theme carries over to both thumbsticks, all four face buttons, and the three menu buttons in the center of the controller. The triggers, bumpers, and d-pad feature a matte black finish, and the back case is a bright white. 
Like most other Xbox Series X/S controllers, the Astral Purple edition will cost $64.99. It's available for preorder and releases on September 19. As expected, it features all the usual bells, whistles, and features of the standard Xbox Series X/S controller, so if you’re looking to add a little more purple to your collection, this might be for you. 
While waiting for its release, check out the Stormcloud Vapor controller revealed last month and then read about the Xbox Elite Series 2 "Core" Edition controller. After that, read Game Informer's list of the top 10 best Xbox Series X/S games.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While Starfield is the big sci-fi shooter on Game Pass right now, folks fancying shootier shooting should see another FPS owned by Bethesda: Quake 2. Id Software's 1997 shooter was fancied up with a remaster released as a free update in August, complete with all the old stuff and one notable new addition. MachineGames, the studio behind the modern Wolfenstein games, have created a whole new story campaign for the remaster. I've really enjoyed playing it. It's the old Quake 2 you know and have complicated feelings about, filtered through modern design sensibilities. I think both veterans and newcomers could enjoy blasting these biomechanical alien horrors.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Logitech's G305 Lightspeed mouse is one of my favourites, combining bullet-proof Lightspeed 2.4GHz wireless with a small, light and eminently moddable design. It normally retails for around $40, but today it's down to $33.99 at Amazon US. That's not the best price we've ever seen, but it's still great value for a mouse that remains in my personal rotation a few years after it first debuted.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alan Wake 2 outfit Remedy Entertainment have "always" felt pressured to make their games longer, creative director Sam Lake has observed in a new interview which also picks apart the differences between the forthcoming midwestern spookalot, out this October, and the 2010 original. Lake added that, Remedy's sense of audience expectations notwithstanding, he himself has difficulty setting aside hours for longer games. "[It's] just struggling with finding time and you know, being interested in a story, wanting to see it through," he said. "So it can even be daunting at times to start playing a game that you know is really, really long."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Creative Assembly and SEGA's Total War: PHARAOH has a release date, 11th October 2023. There's also a physical limited edition coming to Europe on 23rd October, for those of you who revel in such things as portraits of faction leaders, packs of cosmetics and posters of the game's campaign map, which you can also check out in the new campaign flyover video below.


In case you're wondering, I've checked with the authorities and yes, PHARAOH should be written in all capitals, making a laughing stock of all previous RPS reporting. If it feels unnatural, try to imagine that you're bellowing the game's title from the summit of a pyramid, so as to remind your embattled subjects of your magnificence. RPS boss Katharine behaves similarly in morning meetings. "EDITOR-IN-CHIEF," she roars at us repeatedly, until somebody rushes her the daily traffic reports, a steaming goblet of sphinx eggs and a gif of a crafty kill in Shadow Gambit.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["Usually, when a player is going through a strategy game, they figure out how things work by trial and error," Total War: Pharaoh's game director Todor Nikolov tells me at this year's Gamescom. "And once they do, they feel the urge to start a brand-new campaign because they've already figured out that portion of the gameplay."
Sitting across the table, these words ring frighteningly true for me. Unbeknownst to Nikolov, he has just described the exact experience I had playing the 50-turn campaign preview for Pharaoh a week earlier to an absolute tee. Unlike the far more knowledgeable brain of frequent RPS contributor Nic Reuben, I am a complete babe in arms when it comes to the Total War juggernaut machine, and it took me attempting to play two other games in the series (Three Kingdoms and Troy) and several restarts in Pharaoh itself before I felt just about confident that I (very vaguely) knew what I was doing. At the time, I thought, 'Man alive, how is Total War still so rubbish at teaching players how it works?' But when I speak to Nikolov a week later, he has some very welcome news for me: there's going to be a dedicated tutorial campaign where players can (hopefully) find their feet. Music to my ears.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The opening theme of Mythforce is a wonderfully observed 1980s positivity ballad in the style of Jayce and The Wheeled Warriors. This song believes in you, aggressively so. "MythForce! MythForce! Everyday people become heroes! / MythForce! MythForce! You and me, we can defeat evil!" The roguelike dungeon dallying that follows doesn't take that "you can do it!" Saturday morning cartoon flavour to its comedic conclusion in the same way an Adult Swim animation might, or a Devolver game would. Instead the real focus seems to be function over flavour, resulting in a skeleton-battering jaunt that is competent and comfortable, yet never fully embracing the silliness promised by the sick guitar riffs of the theme.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Being a dedicated spacer I've never had much interest in the base construction aspect of Starfield, but that was before I learned that you can spacewalk by means of console commands, aka cheats. Reddit user WeirdConcern4666 made history on this front yesterday. Here's how you do it: 1) get up from the cockpit controls, 2) hit the tilde key to open the command console at the bottom of the screen, 3) type "player.setpos x 10" to teleport your character outside the ship, then hit return and 4) type "setgravityscale 0" to engage zero gravity and stop your character plummeting endlessly. Then hit the tilde key again to close the command console, and well, there you go.
Space sure is bigger outside a spaceship, isn't it? Just as well you brought that jetpack. If your vessel of choice is on the bulky side, like mine, you might need to increase the number on the end of "player.setpos" to escape the invisible barriers around your craft's exterior. Witness my character Mary Read's first attempts at a spacewalk below. If you've somehow discarded your jetpack, you can always punt yourself about with the recoil from an appropriately chunky firearm.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I don't know about you, but after spending 100+ hours in both Assassin's Creed Odyssey and Assassin's Creed Valhalla, I'm well up for an AC game that reins its open world in a bit and goes back to the sort-of single city stab-athon the series used to be. The ones where stealth actually mattered, and you felt like a proper assassin working from the shadows. Assassin's Creed Mirage is all this to a tee - as Ubisoft have taken great pains to remind us over the last year as they gear up to celebrate the series' 15th anniversary. 
And after spending three hours playing some of its early mission sequences, I can confirm this is very much a game whose sole purpose is to scratch that nostalgic itch good and proper (before we inevitably hurl ourselves into the still very ambiguous void of whatever the heck Assassin's Creed Infinity is). If, however, you don't have much fondness for those older games, and prefer the more action-oriented RPG-ing of recent Creeds, Mirage is probably going to feel like a step backward from all the things you know and like - and you may be better off waiting until the next big open world entry set in feudal Japan pitches up instead.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The first time I heard of Steam it was, as you might expect, in conjunction with the release of a little FPS called Half-Life 2 back in 2004. You needed Steam to access it, whether you bought the digital version or a retail copy. Given relative unfamiliarity with digital distribution, the nascent status of broadband internet in the UK and US, and the much greater importance of physical game sales at the time, this caused quite a stir. I remember being alarmed by an op-ed over on GameRevolution.com that held forth at length about the risk of conflicts between Steam and other software, if players were outright required to leave it running. How quaint those anxieties seem today - the day of Steam's 20th anniversary. And yet, there's nothing quaint about Steam's ability to shape the field in which it operates.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hitting pause in a video game is like dropping a wall across it. On one side of the wall lies what is called the diegetic space of the game, aka the fictitious world, which is generally the aspect that receives the most interest, the aspect that tends to attract the weasel word "immersive". On the other side of the wall lie menus, settings and other features that form a non-diegetic layer of bald operator functions - technical conveniences and lists of things to tweak or customise, from graphics modes to character inventory, that are cut adrift in a vacuum outside of time. 


In theory, the pause screen and its contents are not truly part of the game. There is no temporality, no sense of place, no threat, no possibility of play, no character or narrative, no save the princess, no press X to Jason or pay respects, no gather your party before travelling forth. As the scholar Madison Schmalzer points out in the paper I'm wonkily paraphrasing here, "the language of the menu itself emphasizes the menu's position as outside of gameplay by labeling the option to continue as 'resume game.' The game world is always privileged as the site that gameplay happens."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There was a time back in my school days when cardgames were all the rage. Everybody had a deck of playing cards in their pocket for cheeky 15 minute rounds of Texas Hold 'Em between lessons, with Milky Way segments and Niknaks wagered in place of chips. Yes, I'm aware I'm starting to sound like Grandpa Simpson, and no, this wasn't from some murky era before the invention of videogames. It was the heyday of the Gameboy Advance! I'm not sure what we were thinking. But two things: 1) decks of playing cards are cheaper than game consoles, and 2) part of the fun, possibly, was that nobody really knew how to play the ostensibly well-known cardgames we were playing.
With the benefit of hindsight, I suspect there may have been creative liberties taken with the rules at times. I knew hair-pulling wasn't a legal move in professional poker. Anyway, I'm reminded of all this by Dungeons & Degenerate Gamblers, a warped and mildly satirical, 90s-styled take on Blackjack from Purple Moss Collectors.

People are already modding Starfield, of course - the options range from "Potato Mode" functionality for lower-spec computers, through somewhat controversial Starfield DLSS mods, to the all-important Starfield script extender, which lets other modders add "scripting capabilities and functionality" to the game. But Bethesda have yet to release proper in-house tools, aka Creation Kit 2.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[AMD's Radeon RX 6800 and 6800 XT graphics cards have proven surprisingly popular even into 2023, as new price drops (and relatively modest gen-on-gen performance increases for newer models) has left them as competitive options in terms of value for money. 
Today we've got a deal on the RX 6800 non-XT, with an MSI model going for just under $400 at Newegg. That's a $70 reduction from its usual price and $20 cheaper than the cheapest RX 6800 model on Amazon. That's an awesome deal for a strong 1440p graphics card that comes with a copy of Starfield Premium Edition (which includes the Shattered Space story expansion, a digital art book, the game's OST and a few weapon/suit skins on top of the base game).

I also know that its video game adaptation, released in 1995 for the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive, was a 16-bit platformer with a similar appeal to other Disney games of the period like Aladdin and The Lion King.

Both those games were re-released in 2021, and now it's Gargoyles' turn. There's a first trailer for Gargoyles Remastered below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The day has come. We are super happy to announce public beta testing for the iOS port of ScummVM in the store. Yes, you read it right! Since Lars Sundström, aka lman, joined our team as the iOS porter, we have made significant progress. Thus, you no longer need to compile ScummVM yourself in order to add it to your iOS or iPadOS device. 
If you want to help by testing this version, just follow this Testflight link and enroll yourself in the test program. This may require installing Apple’s Testflight app. You can find instructions on how to install games and how to play them on our documentation portal.
We truly appreciate your feedback. You can share your thoughts with the Testflight feedback feature, where you can attach screenshots and post detailed descriptions. Alternatively, you can use our bugtracker, e-mail us at ios@scummvm.org, or post on our Discord Server. Your help will let us eventually add ScummVM to the App Store.

This is important because ScummVM currently supports only the Macintosh versions of these games. These versions were produced by Tetraedge and are built on a completely different engine than the original Windows versions; basically, they are reimplementations, not ports. Now, thanks to the folks from ZOOM-Platform, you can easily obtain these game variants.
