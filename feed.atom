        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With a patch incoming, Pathea charts the road ahead.
You may remember Pathea Games' My Time at Sandrock, a life sim game released late last November that we weren’t massively enthused with. We awarded it a 5/10 in our review, saying that the launch version's "bland presentation and technical hiccups" affected this sequel to My Time at Portia. The Switch version sits with a Metascore of 62 from 11 critic reviews at the time of writing, although the PC version stands at 81.
Despite our reservations, this cozy game held a lot of potential and in the months since, the development team at Pathea has been hard at work to correct flaws and bring in new content to keep players engaged. Arguably its biggest update on Switch — version 1.1.4 — is due out imminently, and to get a better sense of what it contains and what’s on the horizon, we recently sat down for a lengthy conversation with some key staff on the Sandrock team to discuss its past and, crucially, its future.

Watch those corners, samurai! Hey, you missed an ammo pack. SAMURAI ARE YOU LISTENING TO ME.
It'll be a while till we find out for sure: Orion is still in the conceptual phase, with CD Projekt expecting to have about 80 people working on it by the end of this year. The higher priority in 2024, it seems, is the next big steaming helping of The Witcher.

        <link href="https://www.destructoid.com/atari-announces-that-qomp2-releases-on-february-22/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=atari-announces-that-qomp2-releases-on-february-22"/>
        <updated>2024-01-22T16:47:19.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Atari has announced that qomp2, the follow-up to the 2021 Pong continuation, will be released on February 20 on PC and console.


qomp was a game that dared to ask dangerous questions like, “What would happen if the Pong ball escaped from the confines of the court and went on an adventure?” I’m not sure how you extrapolate further on that, but Atari and Graphite Lab are going to try. They promise “An enigmatic story of doubt, fear, and self-acceptance, told wordlessly through simple effects and gameplay.” Sounds appropriately depressing.


Alongside the announcement of the release date, they released a short video of the Pong ball being interviewed in vertical cell-phone ratio, and I kind of hate it. I wonder if it’s the knee-jerk revulsion I have toward social media that’s the problem.


I didn’t play the original qomp, but it does sound like a fun premise. For a little while, at least. The first game was only played using a single button, but qomp2 adds a second one that is used for dash. It’s a logical evolution. Pong used no buttons, qomp used one, and qomp2 will use two of them.


This falls in line with Atari’s new focus on smaller games that leverage their existing brands. It’s a bit interesting that, while the original game was created by a group of indie developers under Stuffed Wombat, qomp2 has been handed off to Atari’s frequent collaborator, Graphite Lab. I have to wonder if they’ll be able to capture the same charm and impact of the original qomp.


qomp2 will launch for PC, Switch, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PlayStation 4 and 5 on February 20, 2024.

While that reveal included details about the survival aspects of the game, including multiplayer, crafting, and farming, viewers honed in on the idea of it being Pokémon but with guns. You can capture Pokémon-like monsters called Pals in special balls (and you can capture humans, too), but it's smart to shoot them or hack at them with an axe first to lower their health. And then, once under your command, you can give them their own guns to use, of course. 
Following various trailers since that 2021 reveal, including this gameplay showcase and this one highlighting the different Pals you can find, we learned at Geoff Keighely's Summer Game Fest last year that Palworld would finally…]]></summary>

        <updated>2024-01-22T15:57:38.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last week, many of us were excited to see the official reveal trailer of MachineGames' upcoming Indiana Jones title The Great Circle. But footage shown at Developer Direct last week appears to be hinting at the return of Quake.


During the showcase of the upcoming Indiana Jones release – at around the 11:35 mark – we see a quick shot of a whiteboard, covered in barely legible red ink. However, among these scrawls you can clearly make out the iconic logo from the first Quake game.




Just above that, it's also possible to make out the characters "AKE 6." Given that the first letter is almost cut off from the screen, it could be inferred that this is the other half of the word "QUAKE."


Indy goes gothic


This could easily be nothing more than a throwaway reference, but the fact that it appears at all is interesting. Now, you don't need me to tell you that there's been no confirmation of any Quake projects in the pipeline. At least none that we're aware of.


Having said that, with developer MachineGames taking the reins on the modern Wolfenstein titles – not to mention last year's Quake 2 remaster, in which the studio contributed new maps – no one would be surprised if the team turned its attention to the original Quake.


Whether this would be a reboot or a new entry cannot be said, but given that the number six is present in the Indiana Jones trailer, it could be a continuation. If you're thinking there are only four games in the Quake series, consider Quake Champions the fifth installment. Or even Enemy Territory: Quake Wars.


In any case, these are just rumors at the moment. Chances are, if anyone was going to bring the legendary FPS back, who better than id Software? But MachineGames would definitely be a solid choice, so we'll just have to wait and see if the hidden clue in the video is more than just an Easter egg.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Outside of Resident Evil, Alone in the Dark is one of the most influential survival horror games of all time. While we wait for Pieces Interactive's take on the upcoming reimagining, THQ Nordic has shown what you can expect if you opt for the special version of the game.


Over on the publisher's YouTube channel (as spotted by Bloody Disgusting), we get a little showcase on the Alone in the Dark bonuses that come with the Deluxe Edition. For starters, there are some "authentic Vintage Horror Filters," as well as the director's commentary, if that's your thing.




But the one that will strike a chord with older fans is the "1992 Costume Pack." This – as the name implies – gives the new game the same, low-poly look that the original AITD release had all the way back in the early 90s.


"Ma'am, please stop staring at my triangular nose."


Specifically, it affects the models, turning them from their more modern, highly detailed selves to how they originally looked. It's a nice little way of seeing just how far we've come in terms of video game visuals. Also, nostalgia. Nostalgia is good as well.


While it's been tough for Alone in the Dark to keep its head above the water – what with some mediocre reboots and new installments – this could be the one that reignites interest in the iconic series once more.


I'll tell you for why: For me, personally, this latest attempt to breathe new life into the franchise has been penned by Mikael Hedberg. Even if you don't recognize the name, horror fans will know his work from Amnesia: The Dark Descent, Amnesia: Rebirth, and – more importantly – SOMA. That's enough to get me excited for March 20, at least.

Piranha Bytes, who are one of well over a hundred studios that Embracer bought up in recent years, today posted a statement on Xitter saying "Don't write us off yet!". The statement goes on to say that they're "convinced they will succeed". Succeed at what, you might ask? Not being shut down by Embracer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While there's nothing wrong with playing the remake of Resident Evil 4 as intended, some have been hoping for a first-person view. The VR update does allow for that, but now there is a mod for those that don't have a headset but still want a first-person RE4 experience.


As noted by PCGamer, Nexus Mods user elsuperaguas has released the beta version of a mod for Resident Evil 4 that switches the perspective. Now, without having to use the PSVR 2, you can play last year's remake in glorious first-person.




A recent video from the YouTube channel Residence of Evil shows it in action. It's as you would expect, bringing RE4 more in-line with the seventh and eighth installments in Capcom's iconic survival horror series.


Even Leon's curtains don't get in the way


There are some things you might want to take into account before you install the mod, however. On the download page, elsuperaguas says you will need to install a few things before you can play RE4 in first-person.


Those things are:



1. "Headless Leon" mod so you don't see inside Leon's head.
2. "Laser for every handgun" to fix the misalign of the laser beam.
3. "Invisible Weird Headgears" so you don't see the accessories.




You can also install "Headless Main Characters" if you want to play as Ashley or the Mercenaries content. Once all that's done, you should be good to go.


Unsurprisingly, we declared Resident Evil 4 the best remake/remaster of 2023. Much like the modern takes on RE2 and RE3, Capcom did a fantastic job of making the classic game feel fresh without losing what made the original highly praised special.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Does Apollo justice.
After the success of the original three Ace Attorney games, series creator Shu Takumi was ready to end Phoenix Wright's story. But the world wasn't done with these surprisingly intriguing lawyer games, and so he had to figure out how to make a new game without re-treading old ground. Thus, Apollo Justice, pointy-haired greenhorn lawyer, was born – and Phoenix was unceremoniously disbarred. The following three games, now serialised as the Apollo Justice Trilogy, serve as Apollo's version of Phoenix's story – but because of that tension between Takumi's wants and the players' needs, Apollo never quite gets the spotlight all to himself.
We begin with Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney, set seven years after Trials and Tribulations. In that time, a lot has happened, and the familiar angles of Wright's face are buried behind stubble, grime, and a deep sense of ennui after having lost his attorney's badge. But Apollo Justice, our new main character, isn't going to give up that easily, and joins the Wright Anything Agency (formerly known as the Wright & Co. Law Offices) hoping to make a real difference to the legal profession. Unfortunately for him, he's entered his career during the Dark Age Of The Law, where cowboy prosecutors and manipulative murderers will stop at nothing to get the results they want.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For a series that's defined by its trials and elaborate murder cases, the greatest crime in Ace Attorney history is arguably one we never get to see or take part in. Okay, maybe crime is too strong a word. Miscarriage of justice is perhaps more appropriate, and specifically that of Apollo Justice, the cover star of this latest trilogy in Capcom's beloved lawyer 'em up. Except poor old Apollo isn't really what holds this collection of Ace Attorneys 4, 5 and 6 together at all. Sure, he features in all of them, but at the end of the day, it's still the series' original bluffer supreme Phoenix Wright who heads up most of the casework here, relegating his new protegee back to bench-warming duties almost as soon as Apollo's debut game rolls its credits. What's more, he quickly has to share that space with Athena Cykes, another new hotshot lawyer that enters the firm in Dual Destinies and continues the scrappy defence trifecta in Spirit Of Justice.
The result is a set of games that feel considerably wobblier than Capcom's first and more robust Ace Attorney trilogy, and quite a bit more unfocused than the more recent Victorian-era spin-off, The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles. But despite a slightly unsure start, there are still plenty of career highs to be found here for Wright, Cykes and Justice, and Spirit Of Justice in particular remains one of the series' best entries to date. Those new to Ace Attorney should absolutely begin their journey elsewhere, but for series completionists, the Apollo Justice Trilogy is quite the welcome development.

Outsiders of the Ace Attorney series might not be familiar with the name Apollo Justice, but fans know the character is a big deal. He's second only to Phoenix Wright in terms of playable appearances, and his new collection, the Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney Trilogy, gathers all of those outings in one convenient package. While there's not much new content, quality-of-life improvements and a visual overhaul do a lot to modernize Apollo's courtroom saga, making it a worthwhile journey for fans new and old.

If that's not enough, however, then the good news is that fans can likely look forward to many more titles from the visual novel franchise in the future, as a recent interview from 4Gamer with producer Kenichi Hashimoto (thanks, Nintendo Everything) pretty much confirms that the series will never end.

It looks like the next title from Danganronpa and Master Detective Archives: Rain Code developer Too Kyo Games might be just around the corner as series creator Kazutaka Kodaka has said that he will announce his "insane" new title in the "not-too-distant future" (thanks, Gematsu).
Shared in a recent tweet, Kodaka-san stated that he is currently hard at work on the studio's next title, a project that he says he has become "obsessed" with. While there is a certain fear of burnout in the creator's message, the "insane" and "enthralling" scenario has us interested to see what the team has been cooking up.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I innocently went on holiday on Thursday evening, Palworld was that flagrant cash-in survival game where you can make Pokemon - sorry, Pals - shoot guns and work on an assembly line. As of this morning, it's among the most-played games in the world, one of just six to exceed one million concurrent players on Steam. Right now, it's doing almost twice the numbers of Steam's usual chart-topper Counter-Strike 2. We have entered the Pal Age, it seems - but how long will the feeding frenzy last? How much is owing to it releasing during the quiet time of year with a meme-ish premise, while capitalising on pent-up demand for a proper PC version of Nintendo's monster-catching series?

Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown is finally here and has quickly been racking up praise from seemingly everyone who plays it. With such acclaim, it was only going to be a matter of time before speculation began about what the Ubisoft Montpellier team would turn their talents to next and it seems like the devs themselves have some pretty big dreams.
Last week, two of the game's developers, Christophe Pic (world director) and Rémi Boutin (senior game designer), hosted an 'Ask Us Anything' chat on the r/metroidvania Reddit forum during which they were asked a series of questions about the game, its inspirations and what it means to the Prince of Persia series as a whole.

A tap of the Y button now brings up a brief explainer for whichever individual setting is currently highlighted, a handy lil’ reference for anyone who wants to customise how their Deck (or Steam Deck OLED) runs without knowing exactly how things like TDP limits and half-rate shading affect performance. Clearly it’s also a brutal attack on the livelihoods of honest hardware editors who write guides to this sort of thing, but whatever, Valve.

We love a good cosplay, and boy are there a lot of good ones out there. From the uber-realistic to hyper-stylised, we have seen some certified bangers over the years. Very few, however, have been quite as mind-blowing as the little Super Metroid number we saw over the weekend (thanks, @MetroidDatabase).
Showcased at this year's MAGFest, two builders, Carl and Matt, revealed their Mother Brain costume and it is quite something. Aside from the fact that this 16-bit beauty has been unleashed on the real world in all of its 2D pixel art glory, it also has a LED blinking eye and a light-up brain. Oh yeah, it's also huge.

Atari has announced that qomp 2, the long-awaited sequel to the iconic Pong (and the first qomp, of course), will launch on the Nintendo Switch eShop on February 20th, 2024.
Of course, since Pong's launch back in 1972, the game has had countless spin-offs and knock-offs alike, but Atari states that qomp 2 is an 'artful' sequel that ponders the age-old question: “What would happen if the pong ball escaped the paddles?”

El Shaddai: Ascension of the Metatron is one of the most underappreciated gems of the PS3/Xbox 360 era. That's what people who've played the unusual action platformer, released back in 2011, will tell you.
One look at El Shaddai — the only game developed by Ignition Tokyo before it was shut down just before the game's 2011 release — reveals a stunningly beautiful world bursting with light and colour. Visually, it captured people's attention. However, while the game sold almost 100,000 units by the end of 2011 in Japan, it failed to make a splash anywhere else in the world.

What feels completely wild, however, is this game from a mostly unknown company seemingly becoming a record-shattering hit overnight.


Palworld's official English-language Twitter account has just tweeted a thank you note for Steam users who made Palworld the game with more paid concurrent players out of any game in the history of the platform.




The numbers are amazing, but that's not quite accurate


Palworld, a game that came pretty much out of nowhere, did manage to beat huge company-backed juggernauts such as Cyberpunk 2077, Elden Ring, and even 2024's best-selling game. Yes, that one…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pocketpair, the devs behind the surprise record-obliterating Palworld, have just warned players about one specific bug that might seriously hinder their gameplay experience.


If you're familiar with the "Memory Reset Drug", which is used to reset character stats, take heed. The developers warn that there's a possibility that it can permanently reduce one's capture power. 


Screenshot from Pocketpair's Discord


Pocketpair says it's investigating this issue and advises players to refrain from, uh, doing drugs until they fix this issue. 


The developers don't specify exactly how much of your capture power will go down if this bug knocks on your door, but we have to assume your capture abilities will take a non-negligible hit. This sucks, especially if you've already committed to using these, but as far as release bugs go, it could've been much worse. 


Palworld has hit Steam and the Xbox Game Pass like a meteor — one of those from sci-fi tales that come full of wacky alien lifeforms. After not even 24 hours out, the Pokémon-inspired title was already doing numbers high to the point of dwarfing recent mega-hits such as Lethal Company. 


Some Pokémon fans have been pretty vocal in accusing Palworld of being nothing more than an edgy clone, but whether or not you care for it, I find it very hard to ignore all of the awesome — albeit sometimes questionable — things that this new title brings to the table.


As for this bug, it's completely natural for issues such as this to hit a game on launch, and it's expected that it'll get fixed soon. 


You can now capture cute animals and even human NPCs on Steam and the Xbox Game Pass.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Indiana Jones And The Great Circle was announced at this week's Xbox Deveoper Direct. It looks good! There has been much discussion of its decision to make its tomb raiding first-person (with some third-person traversal and cutscenes), however.

In an interview with Lucasfilm.com, game director Jerk Gustafsson said first-person was "part of MachineGames' DNA", and that the perspective "separates our game from many other action-adventure titles."

The Super Smash Bros. franchise has come a long way since the original launched 25 years ago in 1999. Yes, you read that right — the original Super Smash Bros. is 25 years old tomorrow, 21st January.
If we look at the character roster for a start, we began with a humble offering of 12 playable fighters in Super Smash Bros. for the N64 before this ballooned into a frankly insane total of 89 in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate (DLC characters included).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Coming out in February.
We honestly can't believe 2003 was 21 years ago — the GameCube was proudly at the front of our shelves, and Super Smash Bros. Melee was the ultimate party game. But Open Roads, the next game to be published by Annapurna Interactive, looks back at the mid-2000s with a warm, nostalgic, sepia-tinged glow. So, after attending a recent hands-off preview event, it's no surprise we're left deeply longing to go back to the year 2003.
Open Roads follows Tess — played by Kaitlyn Dever, who recently has been cast as Abby in Season 2 of HBO's The Last of Us — and her mother Opal (played by The Americans' Keri Russel). Following the death of her grandmother, Tess is helping her mother clear out the house they lived in together. The pair discover letters and notes stashed away in the attic that lead to the road trip of a lifetime and uncover a past that Tess never thought possible in her family.

Within the first day of playing, I racked up 11 hours of adventure with my Pals and shared a lot of screenshots of my progress. I’m not alone, either. Over a million players joined the game within the first eight hours of the Beta being released and many of them are saying the same thing — why no photo mode?

We were treated to the release of two new games in the NSO GBA library as Golden Sun and Golden Sun: The Lost Age joined the service. We also got excited to see that Ace Combat 7 will be flying over to Switch, which cheered us up following the news that GAME will be ending its trade-in programme.

Forecasts had turned. Many areas expected to get dusted went untouched. But me, after six hours of walking over thin, old snow, the good stuff finally started to fall as I entered a wood and approached a waterfall. Pretty magic, really. It was so cold that snow settled on my shoulders and my hair froze. Perfect. That's what I craved. Anyway, what are you playing this weekend? Here's what we're clicking on!

The rumour stems from a marketing survey about several future LEGO projects. The original story also suggested this same set could be a 2-in-1 build based on the tree's appearance in Ocarina of Time and Breath of the Wild.

The 'Pokémon-with-guns' game Palworld launched on Xbox, PC and Game Pass yesterday and while it's already surpassed one million sales, it's also making headlines for certain other reasons...
As highlighted by IGN, some Pokémon fans have taken to social media and other parts of the internet to share the "similarities" between Palworld monster designs and Nintendo's famous franchise, claiming it's "not a coincidence" and accusing certain 'Pals' of being blatant "rip-off" of Pokémon designs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As with El Viento, I hadn’t heard of Sol-Deace before Retro-Bit’s reproduction of it was announced. However, it’s a good partner since, like El Viento, it was developed by Wolf Team.


Sol-Deace has something of a confusing history. It was originally released in Japan in 1990 on the Sharp X68000 where it was called Sol-Feace. It would then be ported to the Sega CD in 1991, but when it arrived on a Genesis/Mega Drive cartridge in 1992, it was named Sol-Deace. I don't know why the name changed, but the story uses Feace and Deace as surnames, which maybe they are. Weird words to me, so I'm not sure why they chose them. If I had to guess, I’d say the words probably sound cool to the Japanese ear. However, my only basis for that is the theory that I have no other explanation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The very first Megami Tensei game, Digital Devil Story: Megami Tensei, finally has a full translation, thanks to some intrepid fans. You might be saying, “but it already has one,” but this isn’t the one you’re thinking of. This is the game created in 1987 for Japanese home computers by Telenet.


The Megami Tensei series is best known as a series of games by Atlus, which would eventually expand to Shin Megami Tensei, which includes the Persona series. The series actually began being based on a series of novels by Aya Nishitani before going off in an entirely different direction.


But before Atlus stepped in, Telenet was the first developer to create a video game adaptation. This one was for the Japanese home computers, and it was released a scant few months before Atlus released the Famicom game that would start their long-running series. Confusingly, both are called Digital Devil Story: Megami Tensei. While Atlus’ version was a first-person dungeon crawler, Telenet opted for more of a top-down action RPG. Though, it's still a dungeon crawler, make no mistake.


While Telenet’s take on the series was vastly overshadowed by Atlus, it’s still a pretty neat historical curiosity, if nothing else.


The English translation of the MSX version comes to us from Kaisaan and other collaborators. You can find the patch here at their GitHub.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For a game that's been repeatedly described as "Pokémon with machineguns", the first thing that strikes me about Palworld is just how un-Pokémon-like it actually is. To its credit, it does do quite a good Pokémon Legends: Arceus impression when you first step out on its big, Breath Of The Wild-style hilltop and take in the open world vista of its monster-stuffed starting continent. But if the opening moments of washing up on the island in nothing but your very scantily clad undies hadn't already given it away (seriously, why do shipwrecks always destroy the clothes you had on, but not your smalls underneath?), then the ream of tutorial prompts about punching trees to get more wood, building bases, putting pals to work on said bases, and the endless parade of crafting technologies you'll need to unlock to actually do anything on this godforsaken rock will quickly pull the wool clear away from your hopeful little face. 
For underneath the cute round eyes of its cover stars, Palworld is really a survival game wearing the dead skin suits of Game Freak's catch 'em all monster friends. In a lot of cases, those skin suits are quite literal, such are the blatant palette swaps and so-close-to-copyright-infringement-I-can't-believe-Nintendo's-lawyers-haven't-shut-this-down-years-ago rip-off creatures on display here. For that reason alone, Palworld can feel about as soulless and cynical as it comes. But that's not the worst of it. Even aside from all the survival gubbins, base building and sweatshop automation practices shoved down your throat, Palworld is just an awful example of monster-catching games in general. If it's a Pokémon game on PC you're after, go and play Cassette Beasts. Go and play Coromon, TemTem, or Monster Sanctuary. Anything but this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time reinvented the series in 3D and became its new gold standard, Nintendo followed up with a surreal sequel in Majora's Mask. Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days. Majora's Mask's unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.
Join Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard today and each Friday on Twitch at 2 p.m. CT as they gradually work their way through the entire game until Termina is saved. Archived episodes will be uploaded each Saturday on our second YouTube channel Game Informer Shows, which you can watch both above and by clicking the links below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As I worked on my review for Another Code: Recollection, one concern I kept coming across for the then-upcoming title was whether or not anyone from the original developer, Cing, was involved in the project.


It’s understandable. Cing was a niche but celebrated developer, having been behind Hotel Dusk and Little King Story. If you were a fan of the Another Code series, you probably want the folks behind it to be working on it. What would the games mean to anyone else? However, Cing went bankrupt in 2010, and the staff were scattered to the wind. Nintendo, for their part, gave no indication that any of the original creators were working on the remakes of their games.


At the time of my review, I actually wasn’t allowed to talk about the credits. But now that restriction has passed, and I …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It turns out that the idea of "Pokémon with guns" appears to be pretty popular. Pocket Pair, the developers behind Palworld, have announced that their fledgling title is already selling incredibly well. 


How well, you ask? Well, the team revealed that sales for the newly released game have already crossed the million copies sold mark - and that was in just eight hours. 




Described by the development team as a "monster-catching, survival and crafting game", Palworld just launched yesterday on Steam Early Access and Xbox Game Preview. It's also available for Xbox Game Pass, though the subscription service isn't typically accounted for in sales figures. 


Momentum was strong for Palworld leading up to its release. The night before launch, the game was ranked third on Steam's Wishlist page. On top of that, the hodgepodge project is currently trending on X at the time of this article being published. 


I describe Palworld as a hodgepodge project because it seems to borrow lots of different ideas from other notable games. In his recent impressions of the Early Access build, Destructoid's Eric Van Allen noted that on top of there being similarities to the Pokémon series, there are also elements of Breath of the Wild, Rust, Valheim, and Monster Hunter incorporated throughout too.


Again, Palworld will remain in an Early Access/Game Preview build for at least a year according to its Steam page. There are plenty of additions and changes that Pocket Pair plans to implement in the coming months. Amongst them will be new monsters to catch, new areas and dungeons to explore, fresh buildings and items for survival, and more. The development team also noted that they "are also considering incorporating entirely new game systems based on player feedback and ideas."

Having quite enjoyed Golf Club Wasteland a few years ago (now called Golf Club Nostalgia for, I don't know, reasons), I was quite pumped when developers Demagog Studios announced not one, but two further games set in the same post-apocalyptic universe. The first to come out (albeit only on Netflix at the moment) was the turn-based strategy game Highwater (also a bit of a dud, based on the early Steam demo I played last year), but it's the second game, The Cub (out today on Steam) that has prompted this current moment of teeth-sucking sadness. 
I've been playing a bit of it over the last week, and oh man, it's trying so, so hard to be like Limbo and Inside, but just... doing quite a terrible job of it all. I was looking forward to any excuse I could get to have the soothing sounds of Golf Club's dystopian Radio Nostalgia From Mars show back in my ear drums, but alas. I simply cannot hear it over the sound of my own screams of frustration.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Much of the gaming world is holding its breath in anticipation of the Switch 2, or whatever Nintendo decides to call the follow-up to its hybrid console. For now, we know nothing about it, but it seems developers are already working on titles for the mystery machine (not to be confused with the van from Scooby-Doo).


According to the latest GDC State of the Game Industry survey (as spotted by VGC), about 8% of development teams are currently developing a project for the Switch successor. Considering around over 3,000 developers were asked, this equates to quite a few people saying they're working on something for the Switch successor.




On top of this, when asked which platforms people in the industry were most interested in as developers, 32% said the Nintendo Switch successor. This is above the Xbox Series X|S and the current-gen Switch, but just behind the PS5, which 41% are still interested in.


More are working on Switch 2 games than Amazon Luna


We've been getting hints here and there about the elusive system. Last year, it was rumored that the next Nintendo Switch had been demoed at Gamescom 2023, exclusively for developers.


Given what we've seen in the GDC report, it seems likely that the console must be in the works at this point. The Switch has been out since 2017 and even with the OLED edition launching in 2021, it feels like it's been coming to the end of its lifecycle for some time now.


Those who are said to be working on Switch 2 games are almost certainly being asked to keep mum about it. But with a decent number of dev teams saying they are involved in projects for the as-yet-to-be-announced Nintendo console, we may hopefully start to hear word about it soon. Hope springs eternal, and all that.

And sure, its fake video game is baffling, but I was surprised by how many notes the esports episode hit right. With an Illumatrons team overworked to breaking point by an egotistical owner hawking dangerous supplements, it'll take a con, a frame, fisticuffs, and powerful cheat software to save the day.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I disliked turn-based RPG Kingsvein at first. Quite a bit, in fact. An earlier version of this review would have been a very negative on, filled mostly with complaints and annoyances about opaque and frustrating systems, most of which I've since got over as the intent behind its design has become more clear.
It could definitely explain some things better, and its inscrutably tiny graphics remain a minor nuisance. But it's grown on me a lot, and though it may not be quite the kind of turn-based RPG I get on with best, it's an enjoyable one with a refreshing lack of bloat and timewasting, and with a class and combat system that will be pure catnip to a particular kind of player.

How to deal with the bug threat


Hoarding bugs can show up in seven out of the eight moons in the game, so knowing how to deal with them is very important. The first thing to learn about them is that they're not meant to be a deadly enemy, but rather a competitor of sorts.

Although Ed was first introduced in Street Fighter IV, he didn’t become a playable fighter until Street Fighter V (included in the Season 2 roster of characters). The protege of Balrog sports the same psycho powers that M. Bison wielded, but he thankfully isn’t an evil mastermind. That doesn't make him any less brutal, though, and you can watch him clear a subway car full of Mad Gear gang members in the cinematic trailer below. 


Ed joins Street Fighter 6 as the third fighter in the Year 1 character pass alongside the previously released Rashid and A.K.I. (leaving Akuma as the final Year 1 fighter) and will appear in the story-driven World Tour mode too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Payday 3 was one of those games that was briefly hyped up, but then sank back down once it had been released. Much of that came from the issues that plagued the heist FPS threequel, but it seems developer Starbreeze is determined to make things right.


In a recent post on the Payday 3 website, the studio said it understands that "many of you aren’t satisfied with the game the way it is in its current state." Going forward, then, a "strike team of veteran developers" has been put together, formed from various in-house departments.




The idea, it seems, is to tackle some of the game's biggest problems head-on with a dedicated bunch of developers. Currently, the team is "creating a plan" and "deciding what will shape the game into the heisting experience you expect."


I can hear the A-Team music in my head


Payday 3's insistence that players must be always online even when playing solo resulted in a lot of negative feedback from the community. The developer also released DLC – Syntax Error – just a few weeks after the main game was released.


Given that what fans really want is for the main story they paid full price for to be in working condition, asking for additional money for new content could easily be seen as a bit of an insult.


As such, the new Payday installment is currently showing as "Mostly Negative" for recent Steam reviews, with "Mixed" overall. Starbreeze says it will be revealing further details about plans for updates and improvements sometime in February.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In case you missed it, two new amiibo have a street date of today, January 19, 2024. I know, these things pop up unexpectedly! Those two additions are Noah and Mio, two of the primary protagonists from 2022's Xenoblade Chronicles 3. 


Yes, it's been nearly two years since that game came out, but 2023's Future Redeemed DLC helped keep it fresh in our minds. Well, the DLC and the aforementioned amiibo drop, of course. Those two amiibo come with special outfits, which can be unlocked instantly by scanning the figures in: we have a full guide here if you need help.


Can you get the Noah and Mio amiibo rewards without the amiibo figures?


Note that you can acquire the amiibo outfits through other means, but it's not going to be easy, unless you have an endgame save file handy. Requirements range from defeating a superboss (Seraphic Ceratinia) to spending several hundred Nopon Coins at the Nopon Coin X-change at the Sage's Domicile.


You can find the full patch notes below.


Latest update: Ver. 2.2.0 (Released January 18, 2024) [Full notes]


Additional Functionality



Now compatible with “Noah” and “Mio” amiibo. By scanning the amiibo in “System” > “amiibo” in the Menu Screen, you will be able to use the following special clothing items.

Noah amiiboYou can acquire the “N’s Consul Suit” outfit for Noah. You can also get variations without Noah, Lanz, or Euni’s jacket.


Mio amiiboYou can acquire the “M’s Consul Suit” outfit for Mio. You can also get variations without Mio, Sena, or Taion’s jacket.




Fulfill certain conditions and talk to the NPC Miibomii at Llyn Nyddwr Camp in the Fornis region to receive rewards identical to what would be received with the Noah or Mio amiibo.

Indeed, players will finally get the option to rebuild their Guardians in Destiny 2 sometime before the release of The Final Shape, and what's particularly impressive is that it won't cost a penny. Broadly infamous for its nickel-and-diming of players that's only gotten more aggressive over time, Destiny 2 isn't shy about monetizing a variety of things. Armor transmogrification, for example, comes with a built-in seasonal limit that can only be bypassed by paying, so the obvious expectation was that t…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I keep hitting refresh on the SteamDB page of Palworld. Each time I do, the numbers keep shooting up. Despite the fact that Pocketpick's new game has only come out today – in Early Access as well – the numbers suggest it's going to be a big hit.


When the third-party Steam tracking website posted on Twitter/X earlier, it said Palworld had already reached over 110,000 concurrent players. At the time of writing, that number has gone up to 329,563.




The Top Sellers list on Steam shows it's shot to the number two position (behind the Steam Deck, natch). While this isn't too unusual for a brand-new game that's got some hype behind it, it could well be a sign of things to come for the cute, Pokemon-inspired survival game.


What exactly is Palworld?


If you haven't heard of or are familiar with Palworld yet, don't worry. I wasn't until literally two days ago. If you want a nice breakdown of what the game's like and how it plays, a couple of our writers took a quick look at it.


The Steam page has this to say about it:



Fight, farm, build and work alongside mysterious creatures called "Pals" in this completely new multiplayer, open world survival and crafting game!




It has a little bit of everything, from what I can tell. Well, maybe not everything, but certainly enough for most gamers to get into. I must admit, I'm quietly curious myself. To such an extent that I'm currently downloading it through Xbox Game Pass. May as well, right?

The post Palworld is already seeing over 300,000 concurrent players on Steam appeared first on Destructoid.]]></summary>

For example, consider this year's Festival of the Lost, which once again allows players to vote on their favorite armor ahead of time.


Last year's Festival of the Lost featured some interesting novelties and one of the most coveted Mementos in the game, and while these features are currently expected to return this year, the spooky bug-themed armor voting will not. Instead, this year's vote is down to two different types of wizards, with each of the game's Classes getting their own spellcaster armor to splurge on.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dead Tomb is a game that can spark your interest before you even start playing it. It’s based on a lost media game, Temporel Inc. Its progenitor was released on the Videoway content delivery system, which means it just disappeared when the service shut down.


Being the most complex game on Videoway, it had its fans, and they went to work remaking it by reverse engineering a recorded playthrough of it. I don’t have any firsthand insight on the Videoway, so I’ll again direct you to Hardcore Gaming 101’s write-up. Fans first recreated Temporel Inc. in Flash, and then Collectorvision created an NES port, which was released a few years ago on a cartridge by Limited Run Games under the name of Dead Tomb.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Oh, Starfield. We all had such hope for you. You're not a bad game, of course, but there was definitely some lost potential there. Still, you won a Steam award which is nice, and you're kicking off the new year with the game's first major update.


Originally due to come out on Wednesday, Bethesda released a major patch for Starfield to Steam Beta yesterday, which aims to fix a number of bugs. If you take a look at the official website, you'll see exactly what version 1.9.47.0 comes with.




A quick scroll down the list shows there's been a boatload of fixes to the game. There's some general stuff, such as patching out corruptions to save files on PC, improvements to things like reflections and shadows, and some much-needed tweaks to quests and "random encounters."


But is it enough?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in the depths of 2023's February Steam Next Fest, Roots Of Yggdrasil was one of a handful of games that really caught my attention. Not because it was another beautiful-looking deckbuilder (though that does seem to be a steadily growing niche of mine these days), or because its colourful, inkwash visuals had the air of a Norse-flavoured Okami about them (though it did also help). Rather, it was the way its roguelike foundations meshed with its freeform, but still very goal-driven turn-based building systems, giving you drive and purpose in your construction choices, while also being light and chill, with just the right amount of existential threat nipping at your heels.
It struck me that if, say, my best puzzle strategy bud Dorfromantik was ever turned into a roguelike, this is probably a good approximation of what it would look and feel like, which is, frankly, yep, I'd like that game right now, please. Happily, with Roots Of Yggdrasil now approaching its early access launch on January 24th, I'm very happy to report that it's come on leaps and bounds since that Next Fest demo. This is already a very moreish and polished building game, and I've been struggling to tear myself away from it as I guide my longboat of magic Vikings away from their impending Ragnarok.

The MMOFPS has no barber, no surgeon, it's new character or nothing. After six years (longer, if you count the first game), Bungie are finally planning to change this. An upcoming update will introduce the ability to change your character's look—within limits. For drastic changes, you would still need a new wizard.

Pocketpair's Palworld is about living on an island with a variety of mysterious, fantastical creatures called Pals. What you do from there is your choice; train them, use them to fight the evil poaching syndicate, or build an exploitative industry around them. Even sell or eat them, it's really your call.




To call this "Pokémon with guns" is fairly accurate, sure. Palworld wears its inspirations on its sleeves. It's also a bit more, and a bit stranger, than that concept would imply. So we here at Destructoid tasked two of our bravest adventu…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last summer, Sky TV obtained a somewhat mysterious pirate IPTV blocking injunction at the High Court in London. In the months up to November 2023, that led to UK ISPs blocking at least 400 IPTV domains/subdomains, potentially many more. Available data today suggests a perpetual war of attrition on an unprecedented scale. In the last four weeks alone, Sky blocked almost 4,200 IPTV service URLs; the pirates' response is simple: churn out more.

It's even managed to make a spot for itself on our list of the Best Metroidvania Games you should make a point to play.

What was once a criminally underused design template has become one of the most commonly used formats in games. That’s especially true for indie developers, who seem more than happy to make up for prolonged droughts between actual Metroid and Castlevania titles by concocting their own unique spins on the style. While some 3D games have adopted the formula to success (see: Batman: Arkham Asylum), this list will only highlight 2D-style titles for the sake of clarity. Here are 10 great modern Metroidvanias, in reverse chronological release order, that you’ll have a great time getting lost in.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As part of the ESO 2024 Global Reveal livestream, Zenimax Online gave us a look at the upcoming Elder Scrolls Online expansion, Gold Road.


The new expansion will take place just east of the Gold Coast in the Colovian Highland and West Weald regions of Cyrodiil, which was last depicted in The Elder Scrolls Oblivion. The region contains the city of Skingrad, a location that was teased in the Greymoor Expansion. The map shown off in the post-trailer discussion shows that it’s filling in a vast region just West of the PVP region of Cyrodiil.




Forgotten Prince Ithelia, the Daedric Prince of Paths, is the central antagonist of Gold Road. The deity is said to have the ability to mess with fate and destiny, so Hermaeus Mora deleted the Prince from existence. They were only really mentioned in ESO, supposedly teasing their appearance here. Normally, Zenimax just worked with the schemes of existing Daedric Princes, but this is the first time they really invented a new one.


The Chapter is also going to add Scribing, which is a take on spell crafting from the core series. Spellcrafting was initially planned as a feature for ESO’s release, but it was shelved, assumedly because of how difficult it would be to balance. I know a lot of players who are going to be excited to see it arrive in some form. Though, really, it seems more like it's just skill customization. You will need to own the Gold Road chapter to be able to use this system.


Elder Scrolls Online: Gold Road will be released for PC on June 3, 2024, followed by a release for Xbox Series X|S and PS5 on June 18.

Ryozo Tsujimoto, series producer of both Exoprimal and Monster Hunter, released a developer commentary video breaking down the collaboration of the two beast-battling titles. 




The highlight of the new content for most is likely the inclusion of Rathalos.  The wyvern is sort of the Monster Hunter mascot at this point. The monster has been in every game of the series and was even featured as a boss and assist trophy in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As part of the Xbox Developer Direct Livestream, MachineGames showed off their upcoming Indiana Jones project, Indiana Jones and The Great Circle. Most importantly, it involves Harrison Ford('s likeness) and punching Nazis. Two awesome things.


Actually, there’s probably everything you’d expect from an Indiana Jones game. There’s a whip, torches, the Wilhelm scream, a travel montage, a female sidekick, and ancient (but still functional) puzzles. Interestingly, it’s mostly done in the first person, except when you’re doing more agile activities or looking at Harrison Ford in a cutscene.




Indiana Jones and The Great Circle takes place between Raiders of the Lost Ark and The Last Crusade. In it, Indy witnesses the theft of an artifact from the College he works at. He follows its trail and discovers that it’s central to a deeper mystery.


MachineGames is trying to capture the look, feel, and sound of an Indiana Jones movie, and I’m convinced. I’m not sure if I mentioned this, but Harrison Ford is in it. They promise that you’ll be able to enjoy it, even if you haven’t seen the movies. That’s good because I skipped that last two.


Indiana Jones and The Great Circle is coming to Xbox Series X|S and PC later this year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, during the most recent Xbox Developer Direct, Ara: History Untold, a new strategy game from Oxide Games, got a deep dive revealing gameplay and more. The game was first announced in 2022. 
Oxide talked up its "living world," a procedurally generated map for players to create the society they want in Ara. As the developers say, it will change over time based on players' decisions. You can watch the presentation starting at the 25:00 minute mark. 


Ara's Prestige System pits players to build a nation better than opponents'. The game's score system awards points based on what kind of leader a specific player wants to be. An example, as detailed during today's live stream, is building "Triumphs," or famous buildings throughout history that give large Prestige bonuses.
Oxide is a Maryland-based studio founded in 2013 by former Firaxis developers. Its previous games include 2016's Ashes of the Singularity and Star Swarm. 
Ara: History Untold is expected to be released on PC and PC Game Pass in the fall of this year. However, Oxide plans to keep its "Insider Program" after release, implementing player feedback.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During the Xbox Developer Direct Livestream 2024, developer Ninja Theory revealed some more details about the upcoming Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2 including confirmation of its release date. The action-adventure sequel will release on May 21, 2024 on PC, Xbox Series X|S, and as a Day One on Game Pass title.




That will put the sequel release just short of seven years after the release of Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice. Players will once again jump into the role of Senua as she attempts to overcome the barbaric and brutal raids of Vikings in a tyrannical Iceland. Like the original, Hellblade 2 will explore Senua's story in a cinematic way as she struggles to deal with psychosis which actually helps her traverse the brutal Icelandic landscape.


It's looking to be a great year for cinematic and story-driven games. Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2 will add to that when it releases on May 21, 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today's Xbox Developer Direct had a surprise guest appearance from a third party. Square Enix cut into the stream to show off more of its upcoming Visions of Mana, and confirm a Summer 2024 release window.


The unannounced guest made its appearance directly after Obsidian and Ninja Theory's presentations, to share new details about the next entry in the Mana series. This will actually be the first entry in the series to hit Xbox consoles, so today's appearance on the stream was a bit of a surprise, to say the least.


Much of Visions of Mana looks like Square Enix building on the foundations of its Trials of Mana remake. Fully 3D action-RPG combat, with a bright, colorful look is fitting for the Mana series, after all. But the show-stealer for me was the pikul, a dog-like companion the player can ride around on.




The pikul apparently started out as something of a mix, incorporating both Yorkshire terrier and a pangolin. I love the pikul, and will protect the pikul, and prevent any harm from befalling the pikul.

New visions


Square also talked a bit about its musical score, which will have 100 songs total, and adapt as the player enters combat. It's a really cool effect to hear in practice, and I'm really intrigued to hear it play out in the overworld once the RPG is out.


It's really cool to see the Mana series get this kind of push. A decade ago, the idea of a new Mana game getting shown alongside the likes of an Indiana Jones title and Avowed would've been wild. It really does seem like Xbox is courting a wider range of third-party developers. And man, Visions of Mana is looking solid.


We'll see if the series still has that action-RPG magic when Visions of Mana arrives in Summer 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During today's Xbox Developer Direct, Square Enix made a surprise appearance to pull back the curtains on Visions of Mana, the first new mainline game in the franchise in 15 years. Square Enix also revealed Visions of Mana will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC this summer.
Executive producer Masaru Oyamada discussed the franchise's history, noting there have been 17 entries across its 30 years of existence. He also points out that what is now the Mana series today actually began as Final Fantasy Adventure in 1991. 


Mana series creator Koichi Ishii also joined this segment of the show to discuss how he has supervised the team on its work and implementation of taking what were originally pixelated monsters and converting them into the 3D monsters players will fight in the game. 
Notably, Visions of Mana is the first Mana game coming to Xbox. Oyamada expressed Square Enix's excitement about this first for the series while diving deeper into its real-time action combat. This real-time action combat is what originally separated Final Fantasy Adventure from the Final Fantasy series, which was strictly turn-based at the time. 
Visions of Mana's combat continues to look great, as does its beautifully vibrant world. Unfortunately, there's still a few months to go until PlayStation, Xbox, and PC players can play it because it's due out sometime this summer. 

While waiting for its release, check out the Visions of Mana announcement trailer from The Game Awards 2023 last month.

Unlike the isometric styling of those titles, Avowed is a first-person adventure more in the vein of something like The Elder Scrolls, Fallout, or The Outer Worlds.
Today’s Xbox Developer Direct offered a deeper dive into several important aspects of the game, but the standout feature was an explanation of combat, which aims to be action-oriented but still tactically complex. Players are allowed to use customizable loadouts, including selecting different weapons or other tools for each hand. We saw combinations of swords, shields, wands, and spell usage, and pistols.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Xbox is laying out its road ahead with the Developer Direct 2024. Obsidian started the show today, sharing some new looks at Avowed as it heads for a Fall 2024 window.


Today, we got a deeper look at the first-person RPG from Obsidian Entertainment. Set in the same world as Pillars of Eternity, Eora, Avowed is a more action-oriented approach. And a decent chunk of the opening minutes of today's look covered the scrapping, from magic and swords to flintlock-style pistols. Heck, you can even wield a bunch of wands, if you want. More wands means more magic, after all.


We see some reptilian combatants wielding a breadth of equipment, including shields and ranged weapons. Obsidian says you'll be able to set loadouts for combat and swap between them, letting the player quickly swap around for whatever approach you need. It seems pretty customizable, though I'm not completely sold on it.

Part of Avowed also looks to involve some light mystery-solving. We see some segments of the player talking with various NPCs, trying to discern whether a private is telling the truth or lying, possibly even confronting him. Whatever the player chooses, consequences follow.


Fantasy lands await


We also got a look at the vistas and locales waiting in Avowed. There are lots of different biomes to explore, from forests to deserts, all falling under the general high fantasy umbrella.


As for news on a date, we just have the window of Fall 2024. It was good to see a little bit more of what Avowed has in store, though today's look didn't really hold surprises for those expecting a first-person fantasy RPG. I'm curious to see how Avowed will set itself apart when it arrives later on this year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Ninja Theory appeared on Microsoft's Xbox Developer Direct stream to discuss its sequel, Senua's Saga: Hellblade II. The big news from the footage is the game finally has a release date: May 21. Microsoft also confirmed that the game will be a digital-only release.
The developer revealed it is in the final months of development and outlined some elements to expect from Hellblade II. Senua is not in as much fear of her voices as she was in the original game, but she is still a Celtic warrior who struggles with psychosis. Like the first game, Ninja Theory is working with professionals like Cambridge's Paul Fletcher to ensure Senua represents an accurate version of someone struggling with complex mental issues.


There are a number of new characters she will interact with. Some will appreciate her perspective and consider her an ally, but others will reject her and consider her an enemy. Like the original game, Hellblade II takes 10th century Iceland (which the developer visited for research), and she is fighting against Vikings who are enslaving her people. Ninja Theory is focused on making the game historically accurate but with an obvious layer of fantasy on top.
Combat has been overhauled for the sequel, with the game focusing on the fact that Senua is not a superhero. The goal of the combat is to make players feel like they barely survived each encounter, and the gameplay footage of the combat looks brutal.
Ninja Theory ended the stream saying it hopes to "craft life-changing art with game-changing tech." We will determine if the game lives up to that lofty goal on May 21.]]></summary>

And also, perhaps, Five Nights At Freddy's.
In this latest, gruesome escapade from Sparky Marky developers Clapperheads, you are a zookeeper working the night shift. Your job, initially, is to feed the incarcerated animals and clean up after them while giving them an occasional pat on the nose. But Something Is Wrong. Giraffes aren't supposed to have that many legs, or mandibles. Kangaroos aren't supposed to stick to the ceiling, or have several sets of teeth.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last year was a fantastic year for games, with standout triple-A releases like Baldur's Gate 3, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, Marvel's Spider-Man 2, and great independent games like Jusant, Sea of Stars, and countless others. But in 2023 alone, more than 10,000 developers and people in games-adjacent industries were laid off. Plus, the unchecked rise of A.I. continued, and Unity burned developers with its controversial new game engine policies, not to name a few other not-so-great parts about 2023 – it was a great year for games but one of the worst for those who make them. 
Now, just as 2024 has begun, the Game Developers Conference has released its 12th annual State of the Game Industry report. Its data was collected from 3000 developers surveyed back in October of last year…]]></summary>

Having tried the new RTX 4070 Super, though, it looks like Nvidia aren’t just redeeming the Super badge – they might just right the wrongs of the RTX 40 family as a whole.

The cooperative heist FPS got off to a right bumpy start when the ever-unpopular decision to only be playable if you're online collided with server issues that saw Starbreeze take the game down for a while. Since then, it has failed to rise above 'Mixed' review rating on Steam, not helped by Starbreeze releasing a £15 DLC pack when many players were unhappy with the game they'd just bought for £35.

The main reason being, it adds a new ecological hazard called Badwater, that doesn't only make your water bad, but your crops and beavers at risk of being bad. Still, there are plenty of new buildings to help you harness the power of the stanky water and errr, exercise halls for beavers to get their sweat on. I wouldn't recommend they rehydrate with the bad water, though.

The game is a thrilling adventure, with plenty of excellent combat, puzzle, and traversal challenges. Once you get far enough in the game, you’ll likely encounter one of the most challenging of them all; The Impossible Climb is a late-game platforming/traversal sidequest that demands careful timing, patience, and the use of nearly all the powers you’ve earned up to that point in the story. If you want to prove your mastery of The Lost Crown, it’s the sequence you’ll want to tackle.

It was an intelligent and somewhat loving take on a Zelda-y RPG - a small town hero gets a sword and goes on a rampage fighting some bosses - except the main character is a turnip. And also he tears up any paperwork handed to him. Turnip Boy Robs A Bank follows directly on from his Tax Evasion, and it's not quite as funny or as focused, but it's also an entirely different genre of game, and I have a huge amount respect for that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Another Code: Recollection is perhaps the best kind of remake. It takes two well-liked yet obscure graphic puzzle adventures in 2005's Trace Memory for DS, and 2009's Another Code: R - Journey Into Lost Memories for Wii (which never launched in the U.S.) and gives them a graphical and mechanical overhaul to make them readily available to a new audience.
Join editors Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard as they show off Recollection's improvements and additions compared to the originals and discuss why you may not want to sleep on these adventures this time around.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bethesda has announced The Elder Scrolls: Castles, a new mobile experience from the team behind Fallout Shelter.
Like Fallout Shelter, Castles is a management sim, with Bethesda stating in an X post that “you'll build your own dynasty where every day in our world is a year in the game's world. Citizens are born, they die, rulers change, and can be betrayed.” Players control their own castle over multiple generations of rulers, families, and subjects. Decision-making dictates how well your kingdom operates and how content your subjects are; unhappy citizens may plot to overthrow you. 
Your castle can be expanded with new rooms and items, plus workstations for underlings. It appears to feature a turn-based combat system with players equipping heroes with gear to battle enemies and gather resources to grow their kingdom. Though the game's App Store page states that it includes in-game purchases, it is unclear if Castles is free-to-play or not. 
The Elder Scrolls: Castles has soft-launched in the Philippines and will become available in other regions over the next few months. It is the third mobile game in the series, following The Elder Scrolls: Blades, a traditional RPG, in 2019 and The Elder Scrolls: Legends, a collectible card game, in 2017.]]></summary>

Today, however, the studio announced the end of Rock Band 4 downloadable content.
The news comes more than two years after Harmonix was acquired by Fortnite and Unreal Engine developer Epic Games.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Larian CEO Swen Vincke has been reading Ubisoft director of subscriptions Philippe Tremblay's thoughts from yesterday about how players need to "get comfortable" with renting their games as a package, rather than "having and owning" an individual copy. His broad takeaway is: that ain't it, chief. In a social media thread today, Vincke wrote that "it's going to be a lot harder to get good content if subscription becomes the dominant model and a select group gets to decide what goes to market and what not". He feels that "direct from developer to players is the way". As such you shouldn't expect Baldur's Gate 3, Divinity: Original Sin 2 or any other Larian RPGs to join the Game Pass bandwagon anytime soon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When cute crafting RPG Bandle Tale: A League Of Legends Story was first announced at the end of last year, I don't think I really appreciated the fact it was going to be the next game from the devs behind mortuary farming-me-do Graveyard Keeper. I keep turning this fact over in my head as I watch Lazy Bear Games' associate producer Vlada Redko play a portion of Bandle Tale over Discord for me, with creative director Nikita Kulaga and Riot Forge's creative director Rowan Parker telling me about what's happening onscreen in front of me. As Redko explores the whimsical, knitting-themed city of Bandle as one of League Of Legends' tiny fluffy Yordle creatures, it is, to put it lightly, quite the tonal shift from their previous work. But don't let its cute looks fool you.
This is a crafting RPG with a ferociously long set of skill trees to master, with 40-60 hours' worth of new abilities to learn, objects to construct, errands to run, friends to enlist and - crucially - parties to throw. For in the Bandle woods of Runeterra, life's problems are solved by having a good old fashioned boogie, including the rather urgent issue of fixing the world's portal network, which has collapsed in a mysterious accident. It may have a softer, fluffier-looking surface than Graveyard Keeper, but underneath it looks as though there's just as much to dig into here, so here's what I've learned so far ahead of its release on February 21st.

Developed by apparent Macbeth fans Walking Tree Games GmbH, and published by Starbreeze, it's a heavily horror-themed tribe management sim with a roguelike campaign loop, set in what the developers are calling the "Lovecraftian Stone Age", with flagrant disregard for my nerves. Does the Lovecraftian Stone Age feature any actual walking trees? We'll find out on February 22nd, when the game launches into early access.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I enjoy Games Done Quick, an organisation that raises money for charity (this year is the Prevent Cancer Foundation) by playing games at peak efficiency. If you've never watched it before, I recommend loading up the Twitch stream at about 1am and sort of gently dissociating while someone plays an 80s NES game you've never heard of. Speaking of, one of the headline acts for this year's stream - which is running through to this Sunday 21st - was Peanut Butter, a shiba inu trained to press buttons on command, "playing" a NES game that came out in 1985. Although Peanut Butter obeyed his training, some technical issues colluded to snatch a world best time from him - but he raised many thousands of dollars, so good for him.
Peanut Butter is the latest high tide line in the efforts to put more weird and difficult hurdles between you and the controls of games when speedrunning or streaming them. And I must ask: where next? A cat? A snapping turtle biting pressure sensors? A Grey parrot to play a game without any input from you at all? Where will this madness end!?

Along the way, you'll both fight deadly arcane constructs (fantasy robots), and enlist one called Ayuzhan as your Seneschal Companion. These machinations aren't just devilish, in other words. They are literal machinations, with all manner of automated foe awaiting beneath the deserts of Kehjistan.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As the release of the (deep breath) Tomb Raider I-III Remastered Starring Lara Croft approaches (yes, that is its full and official Steam title) on February 14th, developers Aspyr have detailed some of the game's new features over on the PlayStation Blog, and how they've approached bringing the art, controls and effects up to date for 2023. Personally, I'm extremely pleased to see they've added a photo mode, for example, as I spent inordinate amounts of time making Lara do creepy side-eye smiles during inappropriate Shadow Of The Tomb Raider scenes. But I'm also heartened to see they've kept in the original tank controls as an optional extra, alongside a more modern control scheme to make them more approachable.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dave The Diver was one of last year's surprise hits, but though some called it an indie game, it was actually the work of Mintrocket, a subsidiary of Korean publisher Nexon. Now Mintrocket have announced their next game and it seems less likely to cause such confusion. It's called Wakerunners, and it's a team-based "battle action game" about heroes smashing at each other.

It'll have a demo in Steam Next Fest next month and there's a teaser trailer below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wakerunners is the next game from developer Mintrocket, which made a name for itself last year with the excellent Dave the Diver. Mintrocket did confirm to us that Wakerunners is being developed by a different internal team (apparently it has a number of projects from distinct teams going at once), but the pedigree is still worth calling out.
As for the game itself, you can check out the game's teaser trailer below.


Technically, the game was soft-revealed in 2022 as Project TB and is a 4v4 and 5vr top-down competitive action game. The game follows a collection of factions trying to survive in a post-apocalyptic earth. The combat leans on a fast-paced system where players glide across the arena using acceleration and deceleration to their advantage as they engage in close-quarters combat. You will apparently be able to swap characters mid-battle, which will obviously affect strategies.

A demo will be available for the game during the next Steam Next Fest, which will include five different modes and seven playable characters. Right now the game is currently only confirmed for PC.]]></summary>

Now, just a little over a month since its release, Embark is set to release Update 1.5.0 and a new limited-time mode, Solo Bank It, tomorrow, January 17. 
Embark calls this mode an "experimental" one, pitting 12 single players against each other in PvP matches. The first to obtain a total of 40,000 "Cash wins" takes home the win in Solo Bank It. Similar to standard Bank It, which is already in The Finals, contestants earn Cash by collecting and depositing Coins that drop from eliminated players; Coins can also be found in vaults around the map. 
Watch The Finals Update 1.5.0 trailer for yourself below: 


Elsewhere in this update, Embark is fixing plenty of bugs and making balance changes as well. Plus, Update 1.5.0 "comes with a security update to anti-cheat and fair play" and a store update, too. 
Update 1.5.0 and Solo Bank It go live in The Finals tomorrow, January 17.

It did so with a quick teaser trailer revealing that it's "coming soon." Its announcement coincides with 2024's first Grand Slam tennis tournament, the Australian Open, which began Saturday, January 13. 
"Today, 2K revealed the return of TopSpin with the teaser trailer for TopSpin 2K25, the next must-play sports game from 2K that fully immerses fans into the world of tennis," a press release reads. It also notes more information about the game is "to come." 
Watch the TopSpin 2K25 announcement teaser for yourself below: 


2K did not reveal a release date or a release window, but given that "25" is in the title, it's likely releasing either this year or the next. The last TopSpin game was released in 2011 with Top Spin 4 during the Xbox 360/PlayStation 3 generation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Grand Theft Auto V developer Rockstar Games and Alan Wake 2 studio Remedy Entertainment have a history that goes back years, namely due to the two's work on the Max Payne series. However, the companies are at the center of two trademark disputes filed by Rockstar's parent company, Take-Two Interactive, as first reported by RespawnFirst. In the disputes, Take-Two takes issue with Remedy's new logo it unveiled in April of last year, which features a stylized "R," claiming it's too similar to Rockstar's own "R" logo. 
The trademark disputes – here and here – were filed in the United Kingdom, and Take-Two, based in New York, is named as the "opponent" in it. The disputes were filed on May 11, 2023, which is a month after Remedy unveiled its new logo. 
Notably, despite the trademark dispute, Rockstar and Remedy are working together on a remake package of Max Payne 1 and 2. In October of last year, Remedy said the Max Payne 1 & 2 remake, which is a single game, has "progressed into a production readiness stage."
While waiting to learn more about this trademark conflict, read Game Informer's review of Alan Wake 2, and then watch the official trailer for Grand Theft Auto VI, which Rockstar plans to release in 2025.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[AMD's flagship RDNA 2 graphics card, the RX 6900 XT, continues to drop in price over in the US. Right now you can pick this once-fastest-ever Radeon GPU for just $500 when you buy an open box model from Newegg. That's outstanding, given that this card cost twice as much when it debuted in 2020. 
This is the fancy AsRock Phantom Gaming D model too, which brings a snazzy design and a faster 2340MHz boost clock (versus 2250MHz on the vanilla spec).

The story centers on the demon Malphas getting his hands on an ancient device called The Loom. Created by Zoltun Kulle for benevolent purposes, it’s able to create mechanical constructs, but Malphas has warped the Loom for his own sinister intentions to unleash a plague of evil machines. However, you’ve got your own trick up your sleeves.
Namely, Season of the Construct pairs players with their own mechanized companion called a Seneschal. In addition to lending a hand in combat, tanking incoming attacks, and healing players, the Seneschal serves as the primary power gain system for this season. It f…]]></summary>

Seeking to smooth down feathers ruffled by overpricing and buggy launches, to pick out two of the biggest fan complaints, the developers offered to - amongst other things - make Pharoah’s first paid DLC pack a free update. 
That free update is now upon us, miladies and milords. Available January 25th, it's called High Tides, and introduces two new playable factions with their own units and gods and some additional campaign mechanics. Here’s a trailer.

        <updated>2024-01-16T17:22:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The 2022 World War II horror game Martha is Dead is the latest video game getting a film adaptation. The game’s Italian developer LKA, is partnering with production company Studios Extraordinares to bring the psychological adventure to the big screen.
Martha is Dead is a first-person adventure that follows identical twin sisters, Guilia, the protagonist, and Martha. Set in Tuscany in 1944, during the final stretch of World War II, the sisters are fathered by a Nazi general and have a strained relationship due to the clear favoritism Martha receives from their mother. However, Martha is suddenly found dead, and their mother mistakenly believes Guilia to be Martha, forcing her to assume her late sister’s identity. Supernatural occurrences abound centering on the malevolent entity known as the White Lady.
The film follows the same premise. Studios Extraordinares is led by screenwriter/directors André Hedetoft and Andreas Troedsson, and the company’s website states it’s a “creative powerhouse writing and making high-end action, horror, and science-fiction films from original stories and extraordinary games.” The studio is also working on bringing last year’s sci-fi horror game Fort Solis to TV and film, as well as a movie adaptation of the upcoming horror shooter Veil. 
We didn’t particularly enjoy what Martha is Dead had to offer as a gameplay experience. In his review, editor Wesley LeBlanc scored the experience a 6 out of 10, writing, “LKA’s love of Italy is the only warmth I felt in Martha is Dead. The rest left me feeling as cold as Giulia’s dead sister.” Given the recent success of video game films like The Super Mario Bros. Movie and Five Nights at Freddy's, here’s hoping Martha is Dead can achieve even a fraction of that success. Or, at the very least, we hope it makes for a better movie than a video game.]]></summary>

They've published a new trailer to mark the occasion, in which a group of the game's quarantine zone mercenaries squat around a campfire, supping mugs of what probably isn't cocoa, and listening to guitar music. It strikes a fitting note of world-weariness.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer GSC Game World will finally release S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl on September 5. The first-person shooter will launch on Xbox Series X/S and PC. 
The studio announced this release date in a quick trailer released today, which also calls September 5 the "final release date," indicating GSC Game World is confident it won't be delaying its long-awaited shooter any longer. The game was set to release in the first quarter of 2024 before today's delay.
Check out the Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl final release date announcement trailer for yourself below: 


Officially confirmed in 2020, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl has taken some time to get off the ground after various starts and stops. Then, following what appeared to be smoother development, the team paused its work in February 2022 due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, where GSC Game World is based. Employees were forced to evacuate their homes in places like Kyiv, which is Ukraine's capital. Some employees even volunteered to fight for Ukraine – developer Vladimir "Fresh" Yezhov was killed in combat in 2022, as reported by GameRant.
In December 2022, GSC Game World returned with a new S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 gameplay trailer, and we've been waiting on the game ever since. It was set to launch in 2023 before it was delayed to Q1 of this year, and now we know it's coming to Xbox Series X/S and PC on September 5.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer 11 Bit Studio has unveiled the first full look at Frostpunk 2 gameplay. First announced in August 2021, the sequel to the bleak yet popular city-builder is also coming to Xbox and PC Game Pass.
The trailer provides a look at how decision-making appears in-game. The demands you’ll receive from your citizens appear to be as stressful as the first Frostpunk, as you control a Steward overseeing life in a city situated in an unforgiving tundra where resources are precious and everyone has their own ideas about how society should function. How do you ensure everyone gets fed? What does the education system look like? How do you keep the streets clean of literal and criminal filth? Set 30 years after the original game, citizens can vote to pass laws, and these decisions steer the city’s direction toward multiple outcomes and finales.


11 Bit also announced that Frostpunk 2 is launching on PC Game Pass, alongside Steam, The Epic Store, and GOG, in the first half of 2024. The game will also come to Game Pass on Xbox Series X/S at a later date and is targeting PlayStation 5 as well.

But imagine my shock when I re-installed Immortals Fenyx Rising for the somethingth time, and realised that it has been a comfort game for me all along.
This might make me a massive hypocrite. It's a big Ubisoft RPG filled stuff I complain about modern games having, notably a big map of empty space filled with busywork quests and collectibles. But I don't know what to tell you! It requires concentration but not too much, the set dressing all looks great, and it's doing all that AAA stuff with a wink and a smile, so it's sort of fine. It has fourth wall-breaking meta narration! How can I not like it!

But with an hour of Persona 3 Reload under my belt, P3's  remake felt immediately familiar.

Ever since I got my hands on Persona 3 Reload over the summer, I've described it to folks as "Persona 3 redone in the form of Persona 5 Royal." While that may be a gross oversimplification, it's also pretty high praise. Longtime fans of the Persona series point towards Persona 3 as the entry that changed the course of the series, pointing it down the path it's been on for nearly the last two decades. While Persona 3 may be the most important entry from a mechanical perspective, Persona 5 has the most mainstream relevance, particularly in 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here's a pitch for you: a spec ops shooter, except it's haunted. Well, that's exactly what early access co-op FPS Contain is going for, where four of you gear up in tactical clobber and clear corners of military chumps and anomalous… rumps? It's a mixture of Rainbow Six, a bit of Stalker, and maybe a touch of Control, with gameplay showing real promise. It's also got me thinking about unexpectedly scary moments in shooters, too.

Accordingly, he feels his task is to help you grow "comfortable" with the idea that the game you're playing might be taken offline as part of the release schedule, with Tremblay pointing out that you can still resume your save file when the game is next available.

That title is… Dawnwalker. They’ve also shared a new teaser image, which I think could depict one of two things: a) a vampiric or otherwise supernaturally-inclined hero flying through the air care of a Dishonored-style Blink teleport, sword raised and clawed fingers stretched towards an unseen foe against a blood-red backdrop. Or b) a man with his trousers aflame swinging through the window of a second floor spa while attempting to use his umbrella as a parachute, having received only half a pedicure before the building caught fire.

You look through your list of potential household hazards and select the right one, so your caller gets sent the info on dealing with cockroaches. Except as your week at HSH goes on, your calls start to be less roaches, more "my house smells like death and my dog is acting strangely" or "I can see someone looking through my window at night and hear them breathing heavily."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In February 2022, former designers from CD Projekt Red announced the formation of a new studio called Rebel Wolves. The team revealed its first project would be, unsurprisingly, an RPG, and today, we learned a couple more details about the game, including its title.
The game is called Dawnwalker, and Rebel Wolves describes it as a “story-driven dark fantasy role-playing adventure.” Billed as being the team's dream RPG project, the game has officially entered the alpha stage of development, and Rebel Wolves plans to share more information about it later this year. 
The studio also announced another CD Projekt alumni Mateusz Tomaszkiewicz as the game’s creative director. Tomaszkiewicz work includes Cyberpunk 2077, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, and Thronebreaker: The Witcher Tales.
“We want to craft a world that you will want to explore and dive deep into and tell stories that make you care about the characters,” said Tomaszkiewicz in a press release. “We aim to deliver an experience that will allow for a variety of choices and room for experimentation when replayed. Helping craft this experience with so many talented people will be my mission at Rebel Wolves, and I can't wait for everyone to see what the team has been up to for quite a while now.”
Rebel Wolves didn’t share any more info on Dawnwalker, so questions about its premise, narrative, mechanics, and platforms will go unanswered until hopefully later this year. Until then, the team did release a piece of promotional art, posted above, that should help fuel imaginations of what the team is cooking.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bandai Namco has released Tekken 8’s opening cinematic to whet fans' appetite for the game as its release date draws ever closer. The publisher also confirmed that long-time favorite Eddy Gordo will kick off the roster of Season 1 DLC fighters.
The intro cinematic is impressively rendered and, in true Tekken fashion, utterly absurd. In addition to seeing the main cast throwdown with implausible displays of martial arts, we even see them engage in a full-on battle reminiscent of the Wakanda fight in Avengers: Infinity War. 


The video concludes with the reveal that Eddy Gordo is joining the roster this spring. Since his first appearance in Tekken 3, Eddy has been both beloved and reviled for his extremely effective use of Capoeira, so we're excited to see new tricks he has up his sleeves. 
In a neat behind-the-scenes twist, the trailer shows off some of the motion capture and animation that went into bringing Eddy into the current generation of Tekken. Eddy is the first of four characters that will be added to Tekken 8 throughout the year for purchasers of the Year 1 Season Pass or owners of the Deluxe, Ultimate, or Collector's Editions of the game in which the pass is included.
Tekken 8 launches on January 26 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. You can read our impressions of the game’s Story mode and Arcade mode here.]]></summary>

It's probably officially too far into January to get away with saying Happy New Year now, but stuff it, I'll wish you a good one anyway, as well as a warm welcome back to Letter From The Editor. This month's letter can be considered very much a part two to the one I wrote in November, in which we had a sneaky peek at the behind the scenes process of putting together our annual RPS Advent Calendar (or in regular video game website speak, our big games of the year feature). 
We always have a big old voting barney around November time to decide which games do or don't make the cut in our Advent Calendar (that is: we all submit top ten lists and we count up the votes afterwards), and every year lots of you try and guess which ones will make it over on the RPS Discord. Inevitably, there are only so many slots for what is always a heck of a lot of games put forward, but the key question has always been thus: who voted for what? WELL. For the first time ever, come and find out below as we reveal all.

But, with little over a month to go until the game's release, Square Enix has released a new trailer that teases a climactic fight between protagonist Cloud Strife and his arch-enemy, Sephiroth. 
Running exactly one minute long, this "Destined for Rebirth" trailer features new gameplay, shots of our party of characters like Tifa, Barret, Yuffie, Aerith, and more, and lots of Sephiroth. It also features the game's excellent combat theme, and while some might call it cheesy, it's pretty cool to see shots of Sephiroth and Cloud timed to the rhythm of said theme. 
Check out the Final Fantasy VII Rebirth "Destined for Rebirth" trailer for yourself below:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[War Hospital, out now on Steam, is about subsisting on the periphery of a war and keeping it firmly off-screen by means of adept time management. Set in 1918, it puts you in charge of a field hospital in northern France, a few minutes drive from the frontline. Here’s how all that works: casualties arrive from the trenches by ambulance or stretcher, and are carried by your medics to a clearing station, where nurses look after them before they’re seen by a doctor. Patients may be lightly or severely injured, but they will all eventually die if they’re left unattended.

One was a live service version of Call Of Duty's zombies mode, and the other, a revival of a classic Raven IP. I'm not sad about one and I'm mildly sad over the other, with the mystery not being too hard to solve.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I mentioned this in a What Are We Playing? and the podcast last week, but I've been playing a point and click puzzle game called Twilight Oracle, which is out at the end of the month. It's cool! It reminds me a lot of Legends Of Kyrandia, in that it doesn't need to explain why stuff in the world is like it is, it just is. Big talking fish? Sure. Skull floating in space? You betcha.
Twilight Oracle isn't immune to the kind of counter-intuitive puzzle solves that are sort of inherent to the genre (use pineapple on wallet, etc.), but there's a demo to see for yourself, and I thought it'd be just as well to make more of you aware of it before it comes out on the 30th of January. Also because I wanted to point out that one of the reasons I have been enjoying Twilight Oracle is the colour.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Given the sheer quantity of games releasing on Steam these days, having a neat little elevator pitch for your game can be vital in helping it stand out. For example, if I get an email saying a game is like "Obra Dinn meets such and such" or "Into The Breach but a deckbuilder", that's like personal catnip to me, and can be a handy indicator of whether I should investigate further - maybe watch a gameplay trailer for it, say, or see if it's got a demo. Case in point: this is exactly how I stumbled upon the upcoming Donkey Kong Country-esque platformer Windswept last week, although instead of an email, I saw it on the growing "Your game is too much like..." thread over on Xwitter - which is definitely worth a browse if you have very niche interests in need of a good scratch.

Because Ark: Survival Ascended developers Studio Wildcard and Grove Street Games are promising/threatening to "put the power of unbridled game creation directly in your hands" with the game's next major dev kit update, which will release by the end of January.
This will greatly expand the game's moddability, though concrete details are thin on the ground. It'll ship with a "Mario-inspired" platformer to show you how. There's also a dev kit update planned next week for multiplayer spin-off Ark: The Survival Of The Fittest. This will allow you to "sculpt the ultimate battlegrounds where your fellow ARK survivors will fight to see who will be the ultimate survivor".

Overcrowding in UK prisons was also taken into consideration, undermining claims that small-time pirates risk custodial sentences.

The ScummVM Team is pleased to announce full support for Orion Burger, the classic game by Sanctuary Woods. The engine also adds a few niceties that the original didn't have, such as mouse wheel handling, and using the spacebar to skip walk animations - something the original didn't do properly.
Help us test the game by grabbing a daily build. Read through our testing guidelines. The game's logic was all hardcoded, so we really need people to try all sorts of weird actions, and make sure the game handles everything correctly and matches the original implementation. And please take some screenshots along the way.
Now, luck be with you. And remember, with the aliens cheating on the tests they set up for you, this will be no easy task.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dominions 6 was announced last year, with promise that the latest iteration of the complex 4X god-battler would be thick with UI and quality-of-life improvements. I dared to dream of a game that was more accessible than Dominions 4, the last in the series I played. 

Well, it now has a release date of next Wednesday, January 17th, and there are videos that show it in action.

Similar to other search engines, Yandex appears to make it hard to find the notorious torrent site's official domain name in the top results. The motivation is unclear but other more popular pirate sites remain easy to find.

Discord CEO Jason Citron cites overhiring, which has led to the company becoming "less efficient" in how it operates. The layoffs affected people across various departments. 
The Verge obtained an internal memo from Citron sent to employees announcing the layoffs, which have already happened. That memo explained why the layoffs were happening, when affected employees would receive the email telling them they no longer have a job, and follow-up meetings for those who remain at Discord. 
"We grew quickly and expanded our workforce even faster, increasing by 5x since 2020," Citron writes in the memo. "As a result, we took on more projects and became le…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sand Land, the video game adaptation of Dragon Ball creator Akira Toriyama’s manga of the same name, has a release date and a new trailer setting up the story.
First announced during Summer Game Fest last year, Sand Land launches on April 26. The game centers on the Fiend Prince Beelzebub, a demon summoned to take down a corrupt King and his Royal Army by the human Sheriff Rao. Joined by Beelzebub’s chaperone, Thief, the three must also find the Legendary Spring, an artifact capable of ending a worldwide drought that has transformed the environment into a desert. 


The open-world action RPG features plenty of vehicle piloting and combat. Players take control of various tanks and dune buggies outfitted with weapons such as machine guns to mow down threats while traversing the sand-covered terrain. Sand Land is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PC. 
If that’s not enough Sand Land for you, the animated series that premiered in Japan last year is launching worldwide exclusively on Hulu this spring. Sand Land: The Series tells a brand-new story that picks up from the events of the 2023 film. Check out the trailer below:]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Golden Sun and its sequel, Golden Sun: The Golden Age are joining the Nintendo Switch Online library next week. On January 17, these two classic Game Boy Advance games will be available to play for all Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscribers. 
If you haven't yet played them before, there's probably someone in your life who has. And there's a good chance they mention it a lot, for good reason, too. Golden Sun is an excellent RPG and its sequel serves up even more of the story and magic-heavy combat. If you aren't familiar with these games, check them out in the trailer below: 


"From the humble village of Vale to the mystical peaks of Mt. Aleph, the Golden Sun game sets magic-wielding young heroes Isaac, Garet, Ivan, and Mia on a quest to prevent the ancient power of Alchemy from being unleashed on their home world of Weyard," a press release reads. "Their adventure takes them through towns, caverns, and dungeons as they face wily enemies, confounding puzzles, and epic challenges that push their magical abilities (Psynergy) to their absolute limits. Along the way, they get help from mysterious creates known as Djinn, who aid the heroes in harnessing their Psynergy to unlock potent spells and unstoppable attacks." 
In the sequel, The Lost Age, which is a direct follow-up to Golden Sun, the story follows Felix, another young magic-wielder with a unique twist. 
Both games feature co-op gameplay, so you can adventure through Vale with a friend if you'd like, but both must have access to the games. 

Golden Sun and Golden Sun: The Lost Age hit the Nintendo Switch Online-Expansion Pack library on Wednesday, January 17. 
If you're curious about that library, here's every NES, SNES, Game Boy, N64, Sega Genesis, and GBA game available with the subscription. 
Are you going to check out the Golden Sun games next week? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

Also likely to be approved are provisions to suspend domain names and IP addresses when used for serious criminal purposes. The reframing of copyright infringement as fraud in recent years means that pirate sites may find themselves vulnerable.
