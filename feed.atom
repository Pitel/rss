        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Oh no, poor Kerbal Space Program 2. The extremely anticipated sequel to everyone’s favourite rocket-building space exploration game is a hot mess. A list of bugs longer than a Saturn V reads like a terrible medical diagnosis: quivering periapsis, unpredictable methane leakage, late-stage separation anxiety, loose payloads, non-stop burning, and sensitive nodes.
The developers, smiling bravely in circumstances presumably beyond their control, describe the launch as like dropping a kid off for their first day at school. Well the kid forgot their lunchbox, their uniform, their books and their pencil case. They showed up at the wrong school, on a Saturday during half-term. If you were stranded on a desert island and had to recreate Kerbal Space Program from memory using nothing but coconuts and string, it would look something like Kerbal Space Program 2. The game is nowhere approaching finished, it barely resembles the promotional videos, and it isn’t ready, even by Early Access standards.

Square Enix' Octopath Traveler II, now out and in the hands of eager adventurers everywhere, is known for its varied and colorful cast of characters all on their own respective paths to destiny — And, perhaps knowing that players will have their own chosen one, Nintendo has released eight alternate covers, representing the party of protagonists venturing out into the world of Solistia.
https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1629224655973122049?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1629224655973122049%7Ctwgr%5Ee925b5fc20ee7963e23f7932e7e969f35b74ea0e%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendolife.com%2Fnews%2F2023%2F02%2Fmy-nintendo-offering-exclusive-reversible-switch-box-art-covers-for-octopath-traveler-ii-us
The eight covers are available to for MyNintendo members to download and print out, so you can replace the original boxart with your choice of hero — emblazoning the box with the cheerful dancer Agnea, the smooth-tongued merchant Partitio, the vengeful Osvald, or the sultry thief, Throne. All of the covers feature the beautiful artwork of Naoki Ikushima, and are sure to brighten up your gaming shelf. The set of eight covers will set you back 30 Platinum Points.
Unfortunately, it's not all good news. As noted in the replies, the alternate Octopath Traveler II covers are only available on the North American MyNintendo Store, so European players are out of luck. But hopefully, this offer will soon be extended globally, so that we can all have Throne our favorite Octopath Traveler spotlit on our respective copies of this — pretty durn good — release.
Octopath Traveler II is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Nintendo Switch platforms.

We Nintendo fans are used to a silly name. Sure, the Wii U didn't do a great job of defining the console for what it was and the New 3DS XL and Switch Lite are hardly the most adventurous options out there. However, nothing in recent memory comes close to the device revealed at today's Pokémon Presents: the Pokémon GO Plus +.
Hold on, surely that can't be pronounced "plus plus" on the end? Check out the above advert and you will find that, in fact, it can.

This new animated series is the first collaborative production between Netflix and The Pokémon Company and features a decidedly different direction from previous animated adventures in the Pokémon universe. 
The narrative, which is told through stop-motion animation from Dwarf Studios, stars Haru. a concierge a the Pokémon Resort, and Psyduck. The stories that unfold center around her interactions with the various Pokémon that pass through the resort. 
"Netflix is looking forward to delighting fans in Japan and around the world with Pokémon Concierge, an entirely new visual and storytelling experience featuring groundbreaking stop-motion animation set in the Pokémon world in close collaboration with The Pokémon Company," vice president of Netflix content in Asia Minyoung Kim said in a press release. "We're also excited to reveal this new series on Pokémon Day and provide fans with even more things to look forward to on this special holiday celebrating the popular franchise."
Ever since spring 2020, Netflix has been the exclusive home to the Pokémon anime in the United States. While those seasons have continued the story of Ash Ketchum and Pikachu, Pokémon Concierge represents a completely new focus within the world of Pokémon.
We don't know much more about this new series, but we did receive a teaser trailer, which you can see below.]]></summary>

After he left Square Enix in 2003, Sakaguchi opened his own studio and worked on turn-based adventures like Blue Dragon and Lost Odyssey - games that arguably matched his genre-defining classics - but PC gamers have been largely unable to experience them, until now. Maybe. Sakaguchi recently took part in a Q&A (reported by IGN Japan, translated by VGC) where he expressed the desire to bring his Apple Arcade exclusive Fantasian to PC.

During this morning's Pokemon Direct presentation, it was announced that the hugely popular mobile title, Pokemon GO, will receive connectivity for Switch releases Pokemon Scarlet and Pokemon Violet later today, possibly as soon as you've read these words.
When you next receive gifts and postcards from your Pokemon GO friends, (or purchase them from the in-game stores), you can then forward these postcards to your Pokemon Scarlet/Violet accounts, with each postcard you deliver offering up new color variants for Vivillon, based on the card's location.

In addition, once you have sent these cards, you will be given the opportunity to catch a Roaming Form Gimmighoul back in Pokemon GO. And if that wasn't enough, then once you have gathered 999 Gimmighoul coins, then the money-grabbing critter will evolve into Gholdengo!
Finally, it was revealed that Nintendo and The Pokemon Company are working to bring Pokemon Home connectivity to both Pokemon Scarlet and Pokemon Violet later this year, though no further details were made available. We'll be sure to bring you up to speed when a release date is forthcoming.

Today's Pokemon Presents closed with a confirmation of Pokemon Scarlet and Violet's DLC rollout. The two-part set of post-launch DLC will arrive later this year, with one in the fall and another in the winter of 2023.
The combined name of these packs is "The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero," which will carry some meaning for those who have finished the main campaign of Pokemon Scarlet and Violet. Both DLC will be playable with the save data you've already got from Pokemon Scarlet and Violet, so they're not standalone from the sounds of it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiYSuUoI-dY
Part 1, "The Teal Mask," arrives in fall 2023. You'll visit the land of Kitakami as part of a school trip. The adventure will take you beyond the Paldea region, and look to include some festive wear and locales as part of the excursion.
Part 2 arrives in winter 2023, and is dubbed "The Indigo Disk." Here, you'll study as an exchange student at Blueberry Academy. There looks to be some battles to take on here, and both DLC will have some new Pokemon to catch as well. This includes the Legendary Pokemon; The Teal Mask will feature Ogrepon, while the Indigo Disk highlights Terapagos.
A new horizon
This DLC goes on sale today in the eShop. Purchasing the new packs of Pokemon Scarlet and Violet DLC will net you some new in-game duds today too, as well as a Hisuian Zoroark.

While there are still plenty of questions about what these DLC packs will tackle for Pokemon Scarlet and Violet, and how they'll tie into the mysterious Area Zero, we at least know that more is still on the way for the latest mainline Pokemon. As someone who's enjoyed all the theorycrafting and story discussions around the especially dramatic ending of Scarlet and Violet, I'm very interested in seeing what The Pokemon Company concocts for its post-launch Scarlet and Violet tales.

Nintendo has announced a new gizmo to bridge the gap between Pokemon Sleep and Pokemon Go. Pokemon Go Plus+ is a small device that you apparently sleep with. You press the button when you lie down to sleep and press it again when you wake up.
That would be weird if that was it, but it actually gets stranger. So, apparently, there’s a Pikachu inside this little device that will sing you lullabies and grow friendlier with you as you sleep together. That’s a nice change!
[embed]https://youtu.be/YotWhVj0DVY[/embed]
It will record your sleep data from the Pokemon Sleep app, which will be used in Pokemon Go sometime in the future. You can also carry the device around to automatically spin Pokestops that you pass by and throw balls at Pokemon automatically.
Pokemon Go Plus+ is coming on July 14, 2023. By linking it to Pokemon Go, you’ll be given research that will allow you to catch a Snorlax in a nightcap.

The Pokemon Company gave us more details on "what's next" for Pokemon Scarlet & Violet, and it involves more Tera Raids. At some point in the future, we'll be able to battle with (and presumably capture) Walking Wake and Iron Leaves, which are classified as new paradox Pokemon. Interestingly, each one is exclusive to a unique version of the game, with the former calling Pokemon Scarlet home, and the latter popping up in Pokemon Violet. It's a departure from the current "everyone can face the same Tera Raids" format, though you should be able to play them across versions online.
You can find all the info we know about them below. As each raid approaches, we'll provide our normal coverage of full stat rundowns, strategy guides, and answering the question of whether or not they can be bred.

All the details we have on the February 2023-announced Pokemon Scarlet/Violet Tera Raid events
Walking Wake (Water Dragon) - Scarlet
This Pokemon almost looks like a mix between Suicune and another creature, and will sport the water/dragon types. Either of those individually have been popular with seven-star Tera Raids, so folks probably have a lot of party members ready to take this one on.
Iron Leaves (Grass/Psychic) - Violet
Iron leaves looks a little trickier, as it'll have the grass/psychic types in tow. Its appearance looks a bit less unique, and reminds me of Virizion.

During this morning's Pokemon Direct, The Pokemon Company announced that it is partnering with Netflix to produce a new animated series, Pokemon Concierge, which will tell tales of Pokemon, their trainers, and their adventures, all set on a beautiful, paradisian resort.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvgPiewDncQ&ab_channel=Netflix
Produced by the cutting-edge French animator Dwarf Studios, Pokemon Concierge will utilize super adorable stop-motion animation to tell an array of new and familiar stories, inspired by the comics, anime, and fan contributions about your favorite characters from the world of Pokemon.
A very short teaser trailer saw Psyduck wandering across the white sands of the resort. It looks delightful!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hmmm, how much money is this going to make?
Today at the Pokemon Presents presentation, The Pokemon Company revealed a new set for the trading card game called "Pokemon Trading Card Game Classic." Wow, this thing is probably going to make so much money! The intent seems to be to recreate the look and feel of the game's inaugural set, complete with classic cards like Charizard and Professor Oak. A special board-like arena and tokens are also teased as a commemorative set of sorts.
Billed as a "premium set that will last a lifetime," this is a joint venture between Nendo, Creatures, and The Pokemon Company. The Pokemon World Championship (held later this year in Yokohama, Japan) will provide further details on the set. For now, we just have the above teaser image. This website (which is not live at the time of publication) is also going to provide some info when it's ready.

It’s also an unexpected remaster, redoing and fine-tuning everything from companion AI and facial animations to weather effects and dynamic lighting. It’s an enticing prospect for a game that never previously counted visuals as its strong suit, though there will be a catch: the Spacer’s Choice Edition will have significantly higher PC system requirements than the 2019 original.

What's happened here is: I've come away with thoughts, but they're thoughts on one of three modes that's the least useful one to have thoughts on. The other two - the bulk of the game - weren't playable. Still, what I did play was simplistic fun that valued chaos over stealth, with middling results. Unless the other two modes wrap up its action in more interesting ways, I'm unsure whether I can see Crime Boss racking up the cash when it releases next month.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Annual series initially looked to be taking a year off
Activision has re-confirmed that it intends to release a brand new Call of Duty release in 2023, responding to suggestions that the series would be taking time out this year to focus on DLC and additional content for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 and Call of Duty: Warzone.
But, following a recent report by Bloomberg, the publisher reached out to new outlets to confirm that a new, premium Call of Duty game will launch in 2023, though further details on the title were not forthcoming. According to Bloomberg, developer Sledgehammer Games had initially begun the project as MW2 DLC, but the scope and scale of the project have seen it expanded into its own title — an "extension" of sorts for the MW2 narrative/timeline.
It should also be noted that while 2021 release Call of Duty: Vanguard was one of the weakest-selling entries in recent years, Modern Warfare 2 was a resounding success, having the most lucrative launch in Call of Duty history, as well as being the fastest title in the series to reach the $1 billion sales milestone. While this is purely speculation, it's not hard to imagine Activision's "skip a year" plan was a response to Vanguard's sales, with MW2's staggering success quickly putting paid to that tentative decision.
Call of Duty 2023 is currently in development at Sledgehammer Games.

As we celebrate Pokémon Day, the Pokémon Company has released the entire soundtrack for Pokémon Red and Blue (or Green, if you like) for streaming and download.
The catch is that the Pokémon Sound Library website is region locked to Japan and Asia, meaning you'll need a VPN if you're going to access it. If you're able to visit the site, however, you'll have access to all 45 tracks from the original soundtrack with the ability to download individual .wav versions of each piece of music. The Pokémon Company states that you're free to use the music however you wish so long as you're not generating any revenue from it.

Howdy ho, friends and lovers, and welcome to this week's edition of Whatcha Been Playing? This week sees us waving farewell to February, and optimistically hoping for the sunshine and warm air of the coming spring season. I know I'm more than ready to throw off my second duvet, and I'm sick of keeping warm by throwing spare money bundles on the fire, (I am a Games Journalist after all).
While not quite as jam-packed as 2022, the start of this year has seen the release of quite few big releases, and we're now entering something of a dry period (though we still have a few gems coming in March). It's strange how the industry is yet to quite restore its calendar to its pre-COVID status, and the start of the year is now the new "Holiday releases" period. Ehh,…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Baldur's Gate 3 isn't locked to any platform, though
Larian Studios has locked in a launch date for Baldur's Gate 3 and confirmed the RPG would be coming to PlayStation 5 alongside PC and Mac. The absence of Xbox has led Larian Studios to clarify, though, that the State of Play announcement doesn't mean there's any platform exclusivity.
Fans questioned whether Xbox would also receive Baldur's Gate 3, after Larian only confirmed PS5, PC, and Mac. Over on Reddit, Larian's community manager posted an update on why exactly that is:
Xbox players, we’ve seen your questions about if/when you can expect Baldur’s Gate 3 on Xbox. We’ve had an Xbox version of Baldur’s Gate 3 in the works for some time, but we have run into some technical issues – particularly with split-screen co-op. We are still working on an Xbox version of BG3, but we’re not yet confident enough to announce it. We don’t like announcing anything until we’re ready, because we don’t want to get peoples hopes up until we’re sure we can deliver.
There’s no platform exclusivity preventing us from releasing BG3 on Xbox day and date, should that be a technical possibility. If and when we do announce further platforms, we want to make sure each version lives up to our standards & expectations. Thanks for understanding!

Forging the tale
So while nothing's set in stone, it does look like Larian is at least working on a version of Baldur's Gate 3 for Xbox. At the very least, there is no platform exclusivity tying the version down if everything clicks into place.
It's an odd but refreshing bit of clarity to see, considering how secretive studios can sometimes be with platforms. For Xbox owners, I do hope they get a chance to try this out, whether at launch or later. And for owners of the other options, Baldur's Gate 3 goes live on August 31.

Released to the arcade market in 1989, before eventually being ported to the Famicom and PC Engine platforms, Don Doko Don is a co-op single-screen platformer, in keeping with Taito's similar releases Bubble Bobble, Tumble Pop!, and The Fairyland Story. One or two players don (no pun intended) the pointy hats of hard-working gnomes Bob & Jim, who have taken it upon themselves to rescue the abducted king and princess of Merry Land. And so, with mallet in hand, the non-plumbing bros. set out to face an army of particularly angry-looking mushrooms. They're certainly not fun guys...

As they make their way through the kingdom, Jim & Bob use their mallets to stun the opposition, before tossing the confuddled baddies into each other to knock them out, where they will be replaced with point-boosting fruits. If this all sounds familiar... Well, a lot of these Taito platformers were incredibly similar, albeit with their own adorable sense of style, punctuated by fun pixel art and jolly soundtracks. Oh, and — of course — if you dawdle too long on a stage, an unkillable villain appears. Though clearly not as frightening as the notorious Baron von Blubba.
Don Doko Don was followed by a single player side-scrolling sequel in 1992, titled Don Doko Don 2, naturally. This title would not see the neon of arcade centers outside of Japan, and was also not featured in the excellent Taito Legends retro compilations, rendering it something of a rarity today.
Don Doko Don is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at $8.

February 2023 has, all things considered, been a surprisingly busy month for the Switch. Not only did we get the likes of Octopath Traveler II, Kirby's Return to Dream Land Deluxe, and Tales of Symphonia Remastered, but the one and only Metroid Prime Remastered also shadow dropped digitally during Nintendo's Direct presentation.
With this in mind, we reckon there are probably a handful of games you might have missed amongst the slew of blockbusters, so to rectify that, the lovely Alex, Zion, and Felix have picked out three hidden gems that you ought to be checking out.

Hi-Fi Rush is a rhythm-based action game developed by Tango Gameworks and published by Bethesda Softworks. It was dropped on the globe as a complete surprise during an Xbox showcase on January 25, 2023, and was available almost immediately on Game Pass for PC and Xbox consoles.
Until recently, Japanese developer Tango Gameworks had been working on an entirely different genre of games, being responsible for The Evil Within and Ghostwire: Tokyo to name just a couple. Hi-Fi Rush could not be any more different from these releases if it tried, with a cartoon-inspired art style and a population of mostly robots.

There's no greater feeling in a Legend of Zelda game than when you first step out onto Hyrule Field, is there? It's the moment when the games shake off the training wheels and let's you loose in the world of Hyrule, free to go in whichever direction you like.
Where on earth do you start? What's that settlement over there? Oh god, why are skeletons sprouting from the ground? Whether you're galloping with Epona or simply slogging it in your trusty brown boots, cruising around Hyrule Field truly encapsulates the adventurous spirit of the Zelda series.

The first time I encountered "VR" was at a county fair in the '90s. It was for a racing game demo, and basically amounted to putting a TV on your head...I think I lost some of my eyesight that day. It was an absolutely fascinating experience all the same, and I've kept my eye on the tech ever since.
Once the first consumer-grade Oculus Rift headset launched, I was there, and saw all of the advancements of the subsequent two decades since the TV-helmet at once: but there was so much more work to do. For the past seven years or so, VR has struggled to balance power and comfort. The Oculus Quest 2 is comfortable, but not super powerful. Other headsets focus on power at the expense of clunk, like multiple finnicky tracking devices. The PlaySt…]]></summary>

The event is being split into two different parts this year, with the first section consisting of 30 different missions that you will need to complete to get your virtual hands on a packet of Gold Seedlings (required for the growth of red, yellow, blue, purple, white, winged, or rock Clover Decor Pikmin). These Clover Pikmin will be important for the second part of the event, so you'll want to get as many of them ready as you can in the early days.

Naturally, old fans and newcomers alike were pumped to see the cult classic get a remaster for the Switch. What a shame, then,…

There wasn’t exactly a buffet of games for Nintendo’s Super Scope. It was only supported from ‘92 until ‘94, receiving 14 titles if you’re being generous and 12 titles if you’re being slightly less generous. Of them, a lot are missable. The one that usually comes to mind for anyone not intimately familiar with the shoulder rod is Yoshi’s Safari, but those in the know are aware of Battle Clash and its sequel Metal Combat: Falcon’s Revenge.
Both games were developed by Intelligent Systems exclusively for Nintendo’s grey wrapping-paper tube. Mario may have got all the attention for his unhinged rampage, but it was the mechs that showed what the space bazooka could do.

The final demo for Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty is finally available. Koei Tecmo and Team Ninja's action RPG has its final demo out now, ahead of its launch next week.
The Wo Long demo is live now on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC platforms. Save progress will carry over into the full game, and for those too busy to hop in this weekend, the demo won't go away when the game launches. The final Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty demo is slated to stay live through March 26.
Included in the final demo are Chapter 1: Village of Calamity and Chapter 2: Two Chivalrous Heroes. Starting here won't just net you an easy on-ramp to the full game, but also a reward in the "Crouching Dragon Helmet" item.
Alongside the demo release, you can also get a glimpse of Team Ninja's new action-RPG here in the brand-new launch trailer here:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pi7vQOpfquo
A fight for the kingdom
Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty heads to the Three Kingdoms era, so fans of Dynasty Warriors or other virtual adaptations will feel right at home. This is, however, Team Ninja tackling the action.
Considering the trajectory Team Ninja has struck with Nioh, it seems we can expect more fantasy and some punishing swordplay.
Luckily for fans of Team Ninja's work, Wo Long looks to have held up in all of our early looks at the game. As Chris noted in a recent preview, it's ticking all the right boxes, even if it's not for the faint of heart.
With today's demo, you'll get at least a chance to see whether you're up for it ahead of the full game. And hey, if you end up liking it, Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty arrives on PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC next week on March 3.

My trip to the Mun is going to have to wait. Kerbal Space Program 2 has finally been released into Early Access, and my experiences with it thus far are pretty poor, to say the least. Despite this – and I want to get this out of the way off the hop – I’m optimistic it’s going in the right direction.
Kerbal Space Program is a game that either needed an overhaul or at least a clean-up. While Steam has me clocked at over 250 hours in the first KSP, a lot of it was done before the campaign was added. Once that hit, the whole game lost its magic for me. I wasn’t content grinding for science points just to regain parts that I’d grown accustomed to. The budgetary responsibilities were just a needless barrier. However, I wanted a managerial meta-game.

It's F-F-F-Friday, so it's time to take a look at the next title that Epic Games Store will be offering up to its customer base free of charge — Next week, you'll be looking to get your entrepreneurial hat on, with the arrival of tycoon simulation Rise of Industry, available to download from March 2.
Released in 2019 and developed by the delightfully named Dapper Penguin Studios, Rise of Industry tasks the player with building and maintaining a thriving industrial economy, set against the backdrop of the money-busting 1930s. The player will be required to micro-manage a number of key factors of industry, from sourcing the raw materials, to building factories and warehouses, to implementing shipping routes and securing trade agreements with other towns, cities, and countries.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUBk00oyVpU&ab_channel=DapperPenguinStudios
Of course, you are not the only ambitious entrepreneur on the block, and you must ensure that your rivals don't pull the rug out from underneath you, as you adapt to changing climates, offer competitive rates and deals, and ensure the speedy manufacture and delivery of over 150 different products. Rise of Industry features several scenarios with which to test your mandate mettle, or an endless sandbox mode with which the player can build, expand, and modernize their empire at will. With easy-to-learn mechanics and myriad management features, this looks to be a title to keep the ol' noodle occupied well into the wee small hours.
Rise of Industry will be able to download from Epic Games Store from March 2 until March 9. Until then, players still have the opportunity to bag current freebie Duskers, before its removal on Wednesday.

Nintendo is confirming reports that it will not be attending E3 2023. Today, the company says the event doesn't fit into its plans for the year.
"We approach our involvement in any event on a case-by-case basis and are always considering various ways to engage with our fans," said Nintendo in a statement, via IGN. "Since this year’s E3 show didn’t fit into our plans, we have made the decision to not participate. However, we have been and continue to be a strong supporter of the ESA and E3."
IGN previously reported that Nintendo, alongside Sony and Microsoft, would not be attending this year's E3. Xbox will be hosting its own event in Los Angeles, but it won't be on the E3 show floor in the Los Angeles Convention Center.
The state of E3 2023
With its June date closing in, the question remains of which companies will be at E3 2023. Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot had said the publisher would be at E3 if the show happened, with the company later clarifying that it does seem set to attend.
The overall wariness is notable, though. It might just be an issue of timing; Nintendo will have launched Tears of the Kingdom already by June, leaving just Pikmin 4 left on the docket. Sony hasn't been part of E3 for years now. But that does raise the question: who will be at E3 2023?
Hopefully we find out soon, as June isn't getting any farther away.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Most RPGs set you off on some kind of grand quest, a hero's journey filled with danger and peril as you track down some legendary sword to defeat a world-ending evil. Boots Quest DX, however, has much humbler aspirations. You are a mere boot enthusiast on an adventure to find the very bestest best boots known to man (or blobs, I genuinely can't tell what provenance these rotund creatures hail from), and nothing else will deter you from achieving your lifelong goal. Find a honking great sword on the beach? Trash. A pirate's cutlass? Get in the sea, literally. If it's not a pair of boots, you're not interested - and it all makes for a brisk, anti-RPG adventure that's incredibly refreshing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo has confirmed that it will not participate in E3 this year. This comes in the wake of a recent report stating the three console makers plan to skip the annual event entirely this year. Sony and Microsoft have yet to confirm any formal attendance. 
In a statement to IGN, Nintendo say E3 didn’t fit into its plans but will continue to support the event alongside its organizer, the ESA. 
"We approach our involvement in any event on a case-by-case basis and are always considering various ways to engage with our fans. Since this year’s E3 show didn’t fit into our plans, we have made the decision to not participate. However, we have been and continue to be a strong supporter of the ESA and E3."
Although Nintendo was the first of the three console makers to stop holding live E3 press conferences in favor of pre-recorded Direct videos, it was also the last one to have a traditional booth on the show floor. Up until the last traditional show in 2019, Nintendo still had a large, often elaborate booth with demos where it broadcasted its Treehouse Live stream. Xbox moved its booth out of the convention center to the Microsoft Theater next door in 2018 (though it was still part of E3); PlayStation pulled out of the event entirely in 2019 and hasn't returned. 
E3 2023 is being organized by ReedPop, the company responsible for overseeing PAX and Star Wars Celebration. It will be the first in-person show since the 2019 edition and only the second to take place since the COVID-19 pandemic started (the 2020 and 2022 shows were completely canceled, while 2021 was a virtual event). E3 runs from June 13-16 at the Los Angeles Convention Center and will have dedicated attendance days for industry and fans. The show has no exhibitor list yet, but Ubisoft recently confirmed it will attend E3 if it happens. Xbox head Phil Spencer has expressed support for E3's success but also alluded to Microsoft holding a separate event around the same time in Los Angeles.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The only way is Easy Mode.
Just like any franchise that’s been going as long as it has, Digimon video games have had plenty of ups and downs. Digimon World: Next Order was first released in 2016 for the PlayStation Vita, with a PlayStation 4 release making its way to the West the following year. Since then, it has enjoyed enough of a cult following that it has now been ported to PC and Switch years later. Perhaps owing to its origins on Sony’s handheld console, it feels right at home on the Switch but Digimon World: Next Order is still a title that struggles to find its footing.
The opening of the game throws players into a tense battle between two highly evolved Digimon companions and a powerful opponent that serves as a tutorial for the combat system. Fights play out in real-time, with the player’s partners acting on their own initiative, based on which of the three pre-set AI behaviours you've chosen for them. Players can choose specific actions for them to take, but only if they have accrued enough Order Points through the course of the fight.

Arc System Works has announced that it will be holding an open beta test for its upcoming Xbox and PC (Microsoft Store) ports of crossover anime scrapper BlazBlue Cross Tag Battle. Players on Xbox One, Xbox Series X, and PC can check out the fighter's dynamic action from March 2 through March 5.
The beta test will offer up all of the modes from the 2018 release, from Training and Online Vs, to Story and Survival modes, and even the gallery and replay features. In addition, the entire roster of characters will be unlocked and available, for a staggering 53 playable heroes and villains, pulled from a variety of franchises including Persona, RWBY, Under Night In-Birth, Senran Kagura, and, of course, BlazBlue itself.
https://twitter.com/ArcSystemWorksU/status/1628922634296606721?s=20
All Xbox and PC owners are eligible to take part, and you do not need and Xbox Live Gold account. Arc System Works will use the playtime in order to test the connectivity of the servers, ahead of the game's official launch at some point in the coming months. While the world of BBCTB has been somewhat subdued recently, it remains a great title, packed out with fantastic and unique characters. If you're yet to take it for a spin, mark your calendars for next weekend and be sure to have at it.
BlazBlue Cross Tag Battle launches on Xbox and Microsoft Store this spring. It is available now on PlayStation, Nintendo Switch, and Steam platforms.

There's a dream space game we all imagined, where you pilot a ship freely around the galaxy, landing on planets and space stations and running around them doing stuff, finding things, maybe having a fight, then get back into your ship to launch into space, where you can stop at any time and do a little space walk. Maybe walk around on an asteroid, just because.
Spacebourne 2 isn't the dream. But for a game made, as far as I can tell, by one person, it is an astonishing effort to capture that spirit.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[“At some point," says Joel Jordan, "Animal Crossing poses the question to you with alarming force: how do you want to spend your time?”


Allow me to open with the scoundrel’s refuge that is a seemingly weighty dichotomy: I reckon there’s two really special types of indie games. Those that work wonderfully despite their smaller scope, and those that work wonderfully because of it. It’s that second kind - the particular and peculiar voyages into the miniature and mundane - that really spin wonders. Games like Unpacking, PowerWash Simulator, and Dinkum. Games humble enough in scope, and curious enough in outlook, to be uniquely capable of framing everyday experiences so that their inner oddness and strange magic - unfairly dulled by familiarity - shines. 


So, when Jordon - solo dev on the upcoming Time Bandit - brings up the question: how do you want to spend your time? I’m left pondering it for far longer than I think I otherwise would, thinking about it in context. The obvious answer here is: playing an videogame, please. But Time Bandit’s free demo doesn’t take long to make me almost uncomfortably aware that there’s more than one way to play something. I don’t even need to be anywhere near the PC. I might actually be playing it more when I’m not [X-Files music, but also I’m going somewhere with this].

Developer Netherrealm Studios has yet to announce anything on its end. Yesterday, studio head and Mortal Kombat co-creator Ed Boon cheekily tweeted, “so who has heard the news about Injustice 3?”  referencing the fact that for years, Netherrealm has released an Injustice game between Mortal Kombat entries, so technically, that would be next if it maintained that pattern. 
So who has heard the news about INJUSTICE 3 ?
February 23, 2023
Fans will have to wait for a flashier reveal, but a Mortal Kombat 12 launch would be huge for a year that already has Street Fighter 6 and potentially Tekken 8 on the schedule. Last October, Neththerrealm revealed Mortal Kombat: Onslaught, a role-playing mobile game also slated to release this year. 
Mortal Kombat 11 launched in 2019 to positive reviews (here’s ours). A story expansion called Aftermath arrived in 2020.]]></summary>

Octopath Traveler 2 is finally here, devoid of the three-hour time limit that impeded us before. I said it was looking like a treat for RPG fans, and I remain confident in that assertion.
Octopath Traveler 2 is much more than another dose of the first game. While commonalities are here (for better or for worse), there are many new skills and secrets that firmly break the mold set by Octopath Traveler. In fact, you could miss some crucial features if you intend to play this exactly like its predecessor. Octopath Traveler 2’s open ended structure is all about the joy of discovery, so you don’t have to follow a perfect path to enjoy the game. Still, if you like to optimize your progress (since you play RPGs and clicked this article, I’m guess…]]></summary>

Game announcements are accompanied by million-dollar trailers, teased with reveals of reveals, and some fans tiptoe online to avoid the spoilers of a debut trailer. Meanwhile, films are often first revealed haphazardly through an excel sheet five years before they hit, or mentioned casually in an earnings call - which is exactly how Warner Bros. Discovery announced the existence of Mortal Kombat 12.

Not so much because it's the first Settlers game in thirteen years, but because the last game by developer Ubisoft Blue Byte was Anno 1800, the best city-builder this side of Cities: Skylines. With an evocative depiction of its simulated industrial revolution, including some delightfully chewy production-line wrangling, Anno 1800 was a treat, and I was keen to see what the Dusseldorf-based studio would cook up next.
The answer, unfortunately, is a big bowl of strategy gruel. I'm not sure what has gone wrong in the last five years, but Blue Byte clearly left whatever magic Anno 1800 had in the nineteenth century. The Settlers: New Allies is a dismal strategy affair, confused, anaemic, and achingly dull.

Rocksteady is a fantastic developer, make no bones about it, and I'll gladly argue that we might never get a comic-book adaptation in gaming to rival the immersions, emotion, and raw, genre-defining impact of the amazing Batman: Arkham trilogy — But last night's gameplay overview of the studio's long, long in development Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League left me and others in the gaming community less than enthused.
Spotlit as the centerpiece of the Sony State of Play presentation Suicide Squad received a brand new trailer, as well as a more in-depth gameplay overview, showing off the characters, mechanics, and hook of the "Good-to-be-Bad" comic book adventure.

Plus there will be DLC to add new characters post-launch.

Metropolis serves as the game’s open-world sandbox, and the adventure can be enjoyed alone or with up to three other friends in co-op (requiring an internet connection for both and supports cross-play).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today’s Sony State of Play included a new trailer for Street Fighter 6, which served to introduce three characters joining the roster – the last ones we should expect to join the launch game line-up.
The arrival of Zangief, the professional wrestler, comes as little surprise, since he’s been a part of the line-up for so long. He holds onto old standby moves like his Screw Piledriver, but gets some new moves on display in the trailer, like the Tundra Storm counter throw.
Likewise, it seemed only a matter of time before Cammy was revealed. We learned that the Heavy version of three of her signature moves – the Spiral Arrow, Cannon Spike, and Hooligan Combination – are being enhanced to “allow a delay which results in altered properties for some big damage,” according to a press release that went out concurrent with the trailer.
Lily is the one new addition to the fighting roster. She’s a descendant of the Thunderfoot tribe, the same cultural group that produced T. Hawk, a fighter who appeared in Super Street Fighter II. Lily’s a smaller fighter who appears to regularly speak to the spirits of nature. Her moveset includes titles like Condor Dive, Condor Spire, and Tomahawk Buster, and she pulls out war clubs to inflict damage in her attacks.
Street Fighter 6 is headed for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, and PC on June 2.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's that time of year again: today was Sony's first State of Play of 2023. While it showcased many indie games and an extended look at Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, the presentation started with a look at five new games coming to the recently released PlayStation VR2 headset. If you missed the live stream, here's a refresher.
  



      
												
Foglands
Described on the PlayStation Blog as a "western sci-fi roguelike," Foglands was the first game shown at the livestream today. Developed by an indie studio called Well Told, the game has you fighting monsters, grabbing loot, and trying to escape from danger before you're swallowed by the Fog. Foglands releases later this year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony showed a new trailer for Resident Evil 4 at the most recent State of Play live stream, and it's great. Now, the trailer is below the next paragraph, and I know you want to skip right into watching it. Which you should. However, let me give you the quick hits.
Luis is present in way more of the game now – he's shown with Leon in the minecart section (also we see the minecart section) – we get a brief look at the Krauser fight, more detailed views of combat, the late section of the game that goes full Call of Duty (which is and has always been good), some brief glimpses of Ashley's sections, and a tease for Mercenaries. Okay, the trailer is below. There's a lot more I didn't type out because you aren't reading this, and I do not blame you. Have fun, friends. The game looks great.

        <updated>2023-02-23T21:29:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Accompanied by a somber cover of Radiohead’s “Karma Police,” Bungie rolled out a new look at Lightfall during today’s Sony State of Play presentation, and shared the expansion's launch trailer.
In this latest trailer, we get several new glimpses of the narrative that lies ahead in the expansion. If the trailer is any indication, we’re heading into a pretty bleak moment for the characters we’ve been following in this universe since 2014. Across the course of the trailer, we see the approach of The Witness, as it methodically seems to tear through Earth’s defenses and demoralize its defenders.
It’s no surprise that things are looking especially dire. In the long-running storyline of the Desinty universe, Lightfall is set to be the penultimate storytelling chapter of the current saga, ahead of next year’s The Final Shape. It won’t be a tremendous surprise if the events of Lightfall set up a seemingly insurmountable dilemma for humanity that can only be resolved with the story arc’s conclusion next year.
We won’t have long to wait to see the scope and direction of Lightfall’s narrative; the expansion is set to release next week, on February 28.]]></summary>

Horizon Call of the Mountain is the big showcase piece for the hardware, and Gran Turismo 7 has been updated to include impressive VR modes. Outside of those first-party games, however, the launch library is mostly made of previously released VR games. The one other major exception is from Capcom, which has made Resident Evil Village playable entirely in PlayStation VR2 with a free update.
Resident Evil 7 received a similar PlayStation VR port in 2017, but I found playing that game in VR underwhelming. It was released early in the VR lifecycle when the basic mechanics of the new platform were still being worked out, and you had to play with a controller. It wasn’t ideal.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There’s a touch of poetry to the way Wild Hearts carves so liberally from Monster Hunter. After all, Monster Hunter is a series about an unknown newcomer toppling ancient beasts, chopping up their best bits to create weapons and armour. Forget sleeves, Wild Hearts wears its inspirations as a complete set of clothing crafted from the bones, fur, and teeth of Capcom’s increasingly popular series. Inevitably these materials may feel lesser than the whole from which they were harvested, but they are worn proudly and with confidence nevertheless. 


Besides, as a rare challenger to Monster Hunter, Wild Hearts is clearly aware of the difficulties involved in trying to pull off something new. Perhaps this is why Omega Force’s monster battler is so welcoming to newcomers. Finally, here is a game that is willing to teach a player why this long-running genre is held in such high regard. Wild Hearts is the perfect entry point for anyone who has ever dreamed of being a Monster Hunter Liker. A bombastic, brilliant good time that’s held back by frequent, frustrating performance issues on PC.

After all the struggles and dangers I’ve been through trying to keep my ship’s crew alive in the bone-biting cold of the arctic tundra, that’s definitely a success in my book.
It’s easy to describe Bellular Studio’s survival sim as just ‘Frostpunk on a ship’, but in some ways that’s pretty accurate: you’re the leader of a group trying to survive in a harsh frozen wasteland. But it’s also a comparison that falls short in plenty of other ways. Sure, the engine of this survival sim might run the same as Frostpunk’s, but it’s buried deep in a handcrafted hull. With an overarching story that deals with the drama and despair of survival, together with a cast of underdog characters whose personalities and flaws fuel your determination to keep them alive, The Pale Beyond is much more human than its steampunk counterpart.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tango Gameworks’ founder Shinji Mikami is departing the studio in the coming months after a 12-year tenure. The news was first broken by TrueAchievements, who received and verified a company-wide email to ZeniMax staff announcing the departure before Bethesda publicly confirmed the news on Twitter.
Bethesda’s statement, posted below, doesn't cite a reason or a departure date but thanks Mikami for his tenure at the studio: 
Mikami is credited as the creator of Resident Evil, directing several entries during his long tenure at Capcom, where he also worked on titles such as Dino Crisis, Devil May Cry, and Phoenix Wright. Mikami co-founded Capcom’s Clover Studio in 2004, the team behind Okami, Viewtiful Joe, and God Hand (which he directed), but he departed the publisher after Clover’s closure in 2007. He and former Clover leads would establish Platinum Games later that year, where he directed Vanquish. After leaving Platinum, Mikami founded Tango Gameworks in 2010, which was acquired by ZeniMax the same year. He directed the studio’s first title, The Evil Within, and served as executive producer on its sequel and Tango’s subsequent games, Ghostwire: Tokyo and this year’s Hi-Fi Rush.
It's unclear what Mikami will do next, but he's leaving Tango in a good place for the future. Hi-Fi Rush, the colorful musical action game that surprise launched in late January, was spearheaded by John Johanas, director of The Evil Within 2, and a team of younger designers. It had perhaps the strongest critical reception of Tango's portfolio thus far, with some calling it an early Game of the Year contender (here's our positive review). Mikami has seemingly done a good job fostering fresh talent and new ideas at Tango before his departure, and we're excited to see what's next for the veteran designer.]]></summary>

Developers Fatshark were taking the formula established in their co-op horde shooters Vermintide, throwing in some beefy melee, and moving it over to the 40k universe. Fans were less than happy with the end result, pointing toward technical issues, randomness in the endgame, and a lack of crafting systems, which Fatshark are hoping to fix in today’s update.

Instead of waxing lyrical about that though, I'm here today with good news: My favourite open world 3D spaceflight/trading sim Hardwar is back.
It's been back for over a year, in fact, via Zoom Platform, who've just made the interesting choice to publish it on Steam too, promising that their own store will remain resolutely DRM-free, and that this aims "to help fund additional signings and improvements for our DRM-Free preservation efforts". I'll brush aside analysing this strategy, because the immediate upshot is that, hopefully, Hardwar might finally get its due. In a better world, we'd already be playing its modern descendants.

However, fans have wondered about the status of the previously announced PS VR2 port of the upcoming Resident Evil 4 remake that was briefly teased last year. Capcom has finally broken its silence with a small update.
In a press release, Capcom states that development has officially begun on Resident Evil 4’s VR mode. Additionally, this update will be released as free DLC. Unfortunately, Capcom doesn’t provide a release window, but if the studio has only now commenced serious work on the mode with RE4 a month away from launch, it seems unlikely that PS VR2 owners will be gunning down Ganados in their headsets on day one. We'll just have to wait and see. 
Resident Evil 4 launches on March 24 and is Game Informer’s cover story this month. Be sure to visit our coverage hub to find a month’s worth of exclusive features and videos dissecting the anticipated remake.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fans of Castlevania, namely the Koji Igarashi-led titles such as Symphony of the Night, may want to keep an eye on Grim Guardians: Demon Purge. The game comes from Azure Strike Gunvolt developer Inti Creates and stars two demon-slaying sisters who must scale a monster-laden castle to rescue their high-school from destruction.
Each sister sports a unique playstyle. Shinobu fires a gun making her suited for long-ranged attacks, while Maya cuts down targets with close-ranged melee assaults. The game features two-player co-op, but playing alone lets you swap between sisters on-the-fly, each with their own health bar. This creates a unique form of strategy that we showcase in our gameplay footage below. Watch Marcus Stewart and Wesley LeBlanc explore Grim Guardian: Demon Purge's fiendish offerings to find out if it has the potential to be a worthy Castlevania successor.

With so much marketing fluff surrounding games, it can be nice to hear directly from the devs about their inspirations, struggles, and creative intentions. Hearing them chat candidly, making jokes and getting excited, is a good reminder that real-life people are at the heart of every game - what a crazy concept. Luckily, these types of documentaries seem to be increasingly common, evidenced by the Yakuza (or Like A Dragon) docuseries that just debuted on YouTube.

The Theatrhythm series has been a standout, if criminally underplayed, example of how to both showcase a series’ excellent set of scores while celebrating a prolific franchise’s history. Since the previous entry’s release on 3DS in 2014, Final Fantasy music has evolved thanks to the releases of Final Fantasy XV, Final Fantasy XIV expansions, remakes, and more. Theatrhythm Final Bar Line folds these additions into a mix of returning classics and lesser-known tunes to create an amazing catalog of songs to play through in the series’ trademark take on th…]]></summary>

The event begins at 1 p.m. Pacific/4 p.m. Eastern on Twitch and YouTube and will reveal five new PSVR2 titles. Beyond that, it doesn’t seem like we should expect anything first-party related. The announcement tweet states that third-party titles and indies will get a bulk of the spotlight. Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, which launches in May, will also have an in-depth segment with extended footage.

We last saw Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League at the Game Awards last December, where it was confirmed to launch on May 26 and will feature Kevin Conroy's final video game performance as Batman.

After more than half a decade in development, Atomic Heart has arrived as the first title from developer Mundfish. This BioShock-inspired shooter is an impressive debut in many ways, and it wears its influences on its sleeve – for better and worse. The game’s dazzling world design, extraordinary production values, and fast-paced fights make for a solid campaign, but the derivative plot and often painful writing insist on dragging it down.
Atomic Heart’s premise is one of its most intriguing elements. The game t…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Time is flying by a little too fast in 2023, although it’s not all bad news as a new month means new Game Pass additions. Microsoft have announced the next four games hitting the service before March 3rd, alongside Atomic Heart which releases today. I was interested in the steely Soviet shooter until I read James’ review and saw that the protagonist yells “Crispy critters,” more than once - I think I’ll skip.


Here are the next batch of Game Pass titles:

Merge & Blade (Feb 28th)
Soul Hackers 2 (Feb 28th)
F1 22 (March 2nd)
Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty (March 3rd)

This is my first time hearing of Merge & Blade, not to be confused with Mount & Blade which is also on Game Pass. Merge & Blade is a hybrid between puzzle games and auto-battlers. Rounds will start with a Tetris-like mini-game, but instead of shapes, you’re guiding different unit types and merging them together. You then use your completed party to raid castles and kill monsters. Mixing - or merging - Tetris into a new genre is a recipe for success, so I’ll definitely be downloading this one.

The official Pokémon Twitter account announced this today, with a short 15-second video hyping up the presentation. There's not too much to glean from the video, but it does feature the main theme from Pokémon Red and Blue. Since the reveal earlier this month that Game Boy and Game Boy Advance games are playable on Switch via Nintendo Switch Online, fans have speculated that older Pokémon games like Red, Blue, Yellow, Gold, Silver, Crystal, and even Ruby, Sapphire, and Emerald could appear on the service one day. Perhaps that's an announcement we'll be getting this Sunday.

February 21, 2023
With the presentation lasting 20 minutes, there's plenty of time for an announcement like that and more. And in recent years, the Pokémon Day direct-style presentation has been quite stellar. Last year during the Pokémon Day stream, Pokémon Scarlet and Violet were announced alongside a big Pokémon Legends: Arceus update, a Pokémon Brillaint Diamond and Shining Pearl mystery gift (Shaymin), the Alola update for Pokémon GO, and other announcements for games like Pokémon Unite, Pokémon Masters EX, and Pokémon Cafe Remix. The Pokémon Company event announced a new online anime, too. 
Only time will tell if this year's Presents features as many exciting announcements. Fortunately, we don't have to wait long because Pokémon Day is Monday, February 27. The Pokémon Presents begins at 6 a.m. PT/9 a.m. ET and will run about 20 minutes. 
In the meantime, read Game Informer's Pokémon Scarlet and Violet review and then read our review of Pokémon Legends: Arceus.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft has signed a binding 10-year legal agreement with Nintendo to bring Call of Duty to Nintendo players, presuming the company's colossal $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard is approved. 
Since the acquisition announcement last year, Microsoft has been attempting to prove to government agencies like the U.S.' Federal Trade Commission that this acquisition does not fall into any monopolistic activity and would not harm competitors like PlayStation. However, Microsoft has had a bit of a rough go at it. To counter, though, the company has been proactive in attempting to get the greenlight from the FTC, going as far as promising PlayStation that Call of Duty games will continue to come to Sony's consoles and agreeing to bring Call of Duty to Nintendo hardware. 
Now, Microsoft president and vice chair Brad Smith has announced on Twitter that Microsoft has formally signed a legally binding 10-year agreement with Nintendo to bring Call of Duty games to Nintendo players. Here's the statement Smith released on behalf of Microsoft, in full: 
We’ve now signed a binding 10-year contract to bring Xbox games to Nintendo’s gamers. This is just part of our commitment to bring Xbox games and Activision titles like Call of Duty to more players on more platforms. pic.twitter.com/JmO0hzw1BO
February 21, 2023
Many have already begun to speculate how Activision Blizzard will bring Call of Duty games to Nintendo consoles, which are traditionally much less powerful than current-gen Xbox and PlayStation consoles, with "full feature and content parity." 
If I had to guess, Call of Duty will likely go the route of cloud gaming seen on the Switch, unless Nintendo's next console is set to be a significantly more powerful piece of hardware. Only time will tell. 
In the meantime, read Game Informer's thoughts on the latest Call of Duty in our Modern Warfare II review.

Metroid Prime has long been considered one of the crowning achievements of Nintendo’s GameCube library. The series’ seamless transition to the first-person genre was defined by its frenetic action, massively explorable environments, clever puzzles, and daunting boss encounters. However, the subsequent two decades have worn on the original release, but much like Samus by the end of each game, Metroid Prime Remastered brings the title back to full power.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After the mud and forests of Normandy, and the grim, snowy climes of the Eastern Front, Company Of Heroes 3 feels like World War II on its summer holiday. With two campaigns spanning each side of the sunny Mediterranean, this is arguably Relic's breeziest and most colourful theatre of war yet, evoking the same kind of swagger and gung ho optimism as a Hollywood action flick. It's a feeling that might seem out of place given the current climate, especially now, just days away from the first anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. But while your main objective is always one of domination, gradually turning the map from red to blue on both a micro and macro scale, this is ultimately a game about searing comebacks - of beating back seemingly impossible aggressors, and finding hope where previously there was only despair. I think we could all do with a bit of that in this day and age, even if the battles before you end up feeling like nothing more than the digital equivalent of plonking down a big box of toy soldiers on your living room floor and going daka-daka-daka as they all fall over.

From the look of the screenshots, I was expecting a creepy story in the vein of Little Misfortune or Fran Bow, but instead Birth is infinitely more introspective. Sure, it’s a game about death, decay, and loneliness, but it’s told in the most gentle and genuine way possible. Its themes are heavy, but the game could not be more light-hearted. I have no idea how it does it, but Birth is weirdly the most wholesome yet creepy game I've ever played.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The release of the Pinocchio-inspired Soulslike Lies of P has been narrowed down to this August. A new story trailer introduces a seemingly villainous character, Simon, while highlighting some of the dangerous monstrosities waiting to dismantle players. 
Lies of P unfolds in the fictional, Belle Époque-era French city of Krat as players control Pinocchio, a mechanoid puppet on a quest to become human. A certain Mr. Geppetto might be able to help with that, but Krat has been overtaken by sinister creatures Pinocchio must cut down using his multi-purpose mechanical arm. 


The gameplay takes heavy cues from From Software’s work – Bloodborne in particular – as players take down enemies with deliberate sword attacks, while various mechanical arms grant abilities like firing lightning bolts or a grappling hook to reel in targets. Outside of battles, sidequests present the option of lying to characters, and the truthfulness of your answers alters the direction of these stories. 
Lies of P will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S (including Game Pass), and PC. You can learn more by reading our hands-on preview from last year’s Gamescom.]]></summary>

Tomorrow, And Tomorrow, And Tomorrow is a book about the decades-long relationship between two people who are game developers. And like the above, it would be impossible to explain to someone who doesn't work in the games industry why a small exchange between the two of them made me absolutely roar with laughter.

From an Nvidia tech demo back to in 2019 to an RTX-branded trailer released just last month, this souped-up lighting and reflection tech has been a key piston in propelling the Soviet sci-fi FPS’ hype train. Some slightly awkward news, then: the PC version won’t support ray tracing at launch.
I noticed the lack of ray tracing options in the review build we received last week, and got in touch with the game's press relations team to check if I was missing something, or if they were due to be added via update. The response confirmed that their absence was not an error, and that "the devs will be looking into implementing this post-launch." Well then!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you’re British and you’re old, then you love the ZX Spectrum. (Or the Commodore 64, I suppose, but not both. Never both.) Personally, I’m what they called a “Speccy” kid, and I have carried a deep and profound love of the elderly microcomputer’s cassette tape screeches, colour clash and long, long load times into my adult life, despite the fact that – and please don’t get upset, purists – many of the great Spectrum games don’t hold up in the cold light of the modern day. It’s not that the games are necessarily bad, more that they were tremendous for their time. Still eminently enjoyable, but they require the player to get their head into a certain zone, to put up with what are inarguably quite archaic controls and mechanics. 


Oddly enough, there are some Spectrum games on Steam, thanks to a publisher called Pixel Games. However, with the utmost respect to their output… these are not the kind of games that are going to foster interest in the Speccy amongst modern players. Of course, that may well not be the point, but I’d be a little taken aback if even avowed old-school gamers were going to bother picking up the likes of gardening simulator Pedro, a game that scored 63% in Newsfield’s iconic Crash magazine back in the day, or Sam Stoat: Safebreaker, which did a little better at 68%.

Akka Arrh is a reimagined version of a prototype Atari arcade machine from the ‘80s. Originally scrapped due to a lack of interest, the trailer for the re-release claims that only three cabinets have ever been seen. 40 years later, when Atari reached out to veteran designer Jeff Minter (Tempest 2000, Polybius) to remake one of its games, he chose Akka Arrh. The result is a reimagining of the original concept, fused with Minter’s signature psychedelic visuals and some modern-day improvements. While the game can…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve played a lot of strange games, but never one that lurches between greatness and bafflement as hard or as fast as Atomic Heart. It’s a fascinatingly chaotic medley of ideas, and a rare FPS that lacks even the slightest whiff of battle pass-peddling live serfdom, but those ideas so often fail to gel that it can feel like a game made by several different dev teams. For a shooter set within an alternate history Soviet Union, it could perhaps have used some more central planning.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Atomic Heart has been in development for a long time. From its initial reveal, it has always been a fascinating game that looks good – maybe too good. The game is finally releasing, however, and our first impressions are strong, even if we don't particularly like the protagonist.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I see novelty games on Steam every couple of days; things like gun-wielding slime shooters, or hyper-realistic dog-walking sims. They all force a little chuckle out of me, but none of them have made me belly laugh like I Am Jesus Christ, a first-person retelling of Christ’s tale from birth, to death, to rebirth.  


I Am Jesus Christ’s genre is slightly murky, although, it almost looks like a giant Skyrim mod complete with unfeeling NPCs, first-person spellcasting, and an open world full of quest markers. The newest trailer shows some of Christ’s cool abilities like walking on water, shooting light beams at Satan, and fishing - which is incidentally what I’m looking forward to the most. 


In fairness, the Christ sim looks like a pretty robust and thorough retelling of his journey, depicting scenes like the Last Supper, only this time all the disciples have exclamation marks above their heads. The Steam page also details 30 different miracles (or spells) and a number of different areas to explore.

        <updated>2023-02-20T11:33:27.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Like all good fairytale characters, Pinocchio gets a revision every couple of years - except for 2022, when he was adapted thrice (mostly in bad films, except for the Del Toro one). The loveable puppet isn’t waiting too long for his next comeback, as the RPG Soulslike Lies Of P is coming to PC and Game Pass in August. 


Lies Of P’s newest trailer is mostly a black screen with a lot of VO, but we get a clear look at Pinocchio's daddy Master Gepetto this time. The trailer follows a blob wobbling through very Victorian streets before it slides into some automation and uses the machine’s body as a puppet. The result is a boss-sized monstrosity that sits halfway between Lovecraftian horror and industrial defect. It also reminds me of Gears 5’s weird infected robots, with tentacles and slime hanging off their metallic arms - equally gross and cool.


The newest trailer doesn’t show off any Bloodborne-style combat, but we’ve had plenty of looks at that already, including a fight with a gorilla robocop. This Soulslike looks just as aggressive as you’d expect, emphasising quick dodge rolls and last-minute, anxiety-fueled parries. Pinocchio’s arm doubles up as a grappling hook to pull enemies in, which is always cool in a hack n’ slasher, and makes even more sense when you’re playing as a puppet. Also, is it just me or is Pinocchio pretty this time around?

The game is currently available on the Meta Quest 2, is launching on PlayStation VR2 on February 22nd, and launches on Nintendo Switch later this year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Quickplay strategy games have always been a thing, but they appear to be gaining in popularity lately. I will probably regret not keeping Ozymandias aside for the traditional "summer strategy game for when your brain is a gas" bit, but the scene is looking healthy enough to chance it.
You know that cliché feeling of "just one more turn"? Ozymandias is a bronze age 4X that builds momentum enough to turn that into "just one more game". It is incredibly easy to learn, and despite looking a little dry and number heavy, becomes more effortless, more pleasant the longer you play. It also becomes more clear how much depth there is hidden away in such a light design. It's about proving yourself the most prestigious civilisation, not through total conquest, but by exploiting the lay of the land, and leaning into your strengths.

Through some quirk of bloodline or destiny, wizards can access impossible forces simply by saying magic words. This does not engender caution. A wizard's not a real wizard until they have accidentally set themselves on fire or unleashed an ancient evil. And if you throw four of this dim demigods together? Well, you get the co-op wizard action of the Magicka games, where freestyling elemental combinations can (and often will) lead you to heal a boss or torch your pal's face. Splendid chaos.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jake Solomon, the director of Marvel’s Midnight Suns and the modern XCOM games, has announced his departure from Firaxis. 
Solomon has worked at Firaxis for 23 years and is best known as the lead designer of XCOM: Enemy Unknown and the director of XCOM 2, including its War of the Chosen expansion. He most recently directed Marvel’s Midnight Suns. 
In a statement posted to Twitter, Solomon doesn’t state a specific reason for his resignation but does tease his next project by stating, “My brain is on fire with a new dream. Time to go chase it.” Whether or not this dream keeps him in the game industry is a mystery for now. You can read his full statement below.
Some of our favorite memories of Jake’s time at Firaxis include this funny video of him visiting a game store to convince shoppers to buy XCOM 1. He was also a great sport on our Marvel’s Midnight Suns Rapid-Fire interview. You can read our review of his final project at Firaxis, Marvel's Midnight Suns, here.]]></summary>

Late last year, turn-based indie RPG The Outbound Ghost was delisted from Steam after a statement from lead dev Conrad Grindheim claimed his relationship with publisher Digerati had “dissolved.” Soon after, Digerati filed a lawsuit against developer Conradical over a breach of contract and “several false defamatory” statements. When reporting on the original news, CJ thought the messy situation could get messier, and he was right. Grindheim has now DMCA’d his own game on console storefronts and accused Digerati of withholding royalties.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am legendary ronin Sakomoto Ryoma. I shout "yosh!" as I harvest six (6) gleaming radishes from my allotment. I shoot a bandit in the head with a revolver. I send my adoptive daughter to trade some homemade pickles. I partake in a brooding chat, then stamp on a dude's head. I help a recluse regain his confidence. I have totally forgotten what I was meant to be doing.
Like A Dragon: Ishin feels like a step backward, but in a brilliant way. Kiryu and co. may have moved onto a turn-based future, yet Sakomoto Ryoma and his pals have turned back the clock to an Edo period of brawlin' and chicken betting that's most reminiscent of Yakuza 0, only it's not the roaring 80s but the bloody 1800s. There's nothing here that will convert those who aren't keen on the series, but if you're an ardent fan or a newcomer eager to experience its wild swings between serious and silly, Ishin is an excellent place to start.

Like a Dragon: Ishin is not a new game. It's a remake of an old game – 2014's Ryu Ga Gotoku: Ishin, released only in Japan on the PS3 and PS4. And yet, despite the age of its skeleton, in some ways, the game stands out as one of the more impressive games in developer Ryu Ga Gotoku's (RGG) portfolio – even with a few noticeable weak points. 
Ishin takes place in the 1860s, at the end of Japan's Edo period. You play as Sakamoto Ryoma – a real-life historical figure – who, amid his own revenge scheme, finds himself embroiled in the …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tetris is a new original film coming to Apple TV+, the iPhone maker's streaming service, and if the first trailer for it is any indication, it looks like a great time. 
Released yesterday, Tetris begins with the classic Europe song, "The Final Countdown," which then aptly transitions to Korobeiniki, the main theme of Tetris (you know the one). The trailer then showcases how Taron Egerton's character is deadset on bringing Tetris to everybody after playing it once. Unable to get falling tetrominos out of his head, Egerton's character heads to the Soviet Union to convince the game's creator that he can make him a millionaire. 
Check it out for yourself in the Apple TV+ Tetris trailer below: 


As you can see, Tetris looks great – funny, suspenseful, dramatic, and a seemingly great retelling of how the "greatest game ever made" made its way to our hands via the NES and Game Boy. 
Tetris is directed by Jon S. Baird and written by Noah Pink. It begins streaming on Apple TV+ on March 31. 
Are you going to check Tetris out next month? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

And that's what Wrestling With Emotions: New Kid On The Block offers.

In an age where remakes and retro-inspired projects try recreating what classic games of old felt like, Octopath Traveler II accomplishes something impressive. Despite being rooted in modern design with a host of conveniences, it effortlessly captures the spirit, style, and sense of adventure of the best RPGs from the SNES era, while still innovating and showing there’s life in turn-based battles yet. The feat is even more remarkable, considering Octopath II’s most significant changes are small and subtle.
On the surface, Octopath T…]]></summary>

The trailer shows Eddie Brock, having recovered from the events of the main campaign, making a deal with Mephisto to help rid himself of his darkness. Naturally, this goes about as well as you would expect, leading to Venom joining the Midnight Suns as a playable character to battle this formidable demonic threat. 


Redemption will be available on February 23. It comes included with the game's season pass. Firaxis' role-playing strategy take on the Marvel universe has already received DLC in the form of a Deadpool character and mission pack.

As horrific as the game looks, it's the soundtrack and creepy sound effects that do much of the heavy lifting in building fear and tension. To understand how the remake remixes and enhances the original game's soundscape, I picked the brains of RE4 sound director Hiroshi Tamura and lead composer Kota Suzuki to learn how they're making the game sound as good as it plays. 
Game Informer: A goal for the Resident Evil 4 remake is to create more believable soundscapes. Can you discuss what that means, with examples, and why that's important to the team?

Wild Hearts may seem similar to Monster Hunter and other hunting genre games, but its focus on constructing gadgets in a world steeped in Japanese folklore and feudal-era Japan help it carve its own identity. Like Monster Hunter, you track big game, craft new armor and weapons, and do it all over again.

The original PlayStation VR, from the outside at least, seemed like a moderate success for Sony. It was a functional VR alternative for players who were not interested in entering the world of PC gaming and it had at least one undeniable, exclusive hit with Astro Bot Rescue Mission.
PlayStation VR2 is the next logical step for the sub-platform. It works with Sony’s latest hardware, it improves on basically every aspect of PlayStation VR, but it’s not quite the virtual reality revolution I feel like we’ve been waiting for since the advent of the medium.

Call of the Mountain is meant to be PlayStation VR2’s showcase piece, and in some important ways, it functions as exactly that. Firing off an arrow with a bow in VR feels great, and getting a chance to see the world of Horizon from a novel perspective can be exhilarating. The primary gameplay of Call of the Mountain, however, struggles to find fun at a basic level which ultimately sours the larger experience.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Riot Games released a promotional video this morning revealing its plans to release three League of Legends spin-off games this year. Two of these titles, Song of Nunu and Convergence, had been previously announced, while the third game, The Mageseeker, makes it debut. 


The Mageseeker is set to arrive first sometime this spring. Developed by Digital Sun, the team behind Moonlighter, it’s described as a gritty 2D action RPG. It stars Sylas and takes place in Demacia. You can find The Mageseeker on PC and unspecified consoles. 
Convergence launches this summer and was first revealed at The Game Awards in 2019. Starring Ekko, it’s a 2D action-platforming adventure by Double Stallion that features parkour and time-manipulation mechanics. Convergence launches for PlayStation and Xbox consoles, Switch, and PC via Steam and Epic. 
Song of Nunu closes out the year. Releasing this fall, it centers on the young Nunu and his yeti partner Willump on a search to find Nunu’s mother. The charming adventure game focuses on the pair working together to solve environmental puzzles. Song of Nunu comes from the folks at Tequila Works, the developer of titles such as Rime and Gylt, and it will be available on PlayStation and Xbox consoles, Switch, and PC via Steam and Epic. 
Riot released its first League of Legends spin-off Ruined King in 2021 to generally positive reviews, so we're curious to see how these other projects fair and if they'll attract new, non-MOBA fans coming off Netflix's well-received Arcane series. Which League of Legends title are you most interested in? Let us know in the comments.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Illumination has taken its promotion of The Super Mario Bros. Movie to the next level by launching a website and commercial promoting the brothers’ New York City plumbing business, and it's actually pretty cool. 
You can visit the website here, which features a commercial promoting the Mario Bros. business. Older fans will likely recognize the catchy jingle as the theme song of the 1989 Super Mario Brothers Super Show, which is a nice homage. 


The website also features humorous testimonials, job opportunities, and even a working phone number. Calling this number (929-55-MARIO) plays a recorded message by the Charlie Day-voiced Luigi, which provides a nice sample of his performance as the green-clad sidekick. Texting the number returns a message, which, depending on when you sent it, may return a digital poster for the movie. GI editor Kyle Hilliard got this Toad poster when he texted the number yesterday:
In my case, I only got a message thanking me for my interest in Super Mario Bros. Plumbing with a link to a form submission on the website. I'm not sure what you get for submitting this form, but feel free to find out yourselves. 
The Super Mario Bros. Movie premieres in theaters on April 7. You can check out the official movie poster here. Watch the latest trailer featuring Donkey Kong and Cat Suit Mario here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Breaking news: OpenTTD 13.0 is now available! Depending on your perspective, we’re either two months early for our usual April 1st release, or a bit tardy for the Christmas 2022 release we intended. We think the wait has been worth it. This is one of the largest releases we’ve done in several years, with numerous features and improvements covering the user interface, gameplay features, and modding extensions for NewGRF and Game Script creators. Some of the highlights are: Variable interface scaling at whatever size you want (not just 2x and 4x), with optional chunky bevels for that retro feel. This includes better automatic scaling when using HiDPI or mixed DPI setups. Direct access to NewGRF/AI/GS settings from the new game window. Various small tweaks and improvements to several windows. NewGRFs can now provide engine variants that are shown hierarchically in the purchase list. Multi-track level crossings to keep road vehicles from stopping in the middle of the crossing. Custom league tables for GameScripts. More natural rivers which get wider as they flow downstream. And much more, which can be seen in the changelog or the previous release announcements! In addition to these features and improvements, we’ve fixed lots of bugs. (If you played with the RC2 testing release, most were fixed before then. See the changelog for full details.)

        <id>https://www.scummvm.org/news/archive/#2023-02-03</id>
        <link href="https://www.scummvm.org/news/20230203/"/>
        <updated>2023-02-03T18:07:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few months have passed since we released ScummVM 2.6.1. It's time to prepare for a new release!
Our lovely developers added support, yet again, for a bunch of new ancient games that require testing:
Soldier Boyz
GLK Scott Adams Interactive Fiction games (C64 and ZX Spectrum)
GLK Scott Adams adventures 1-12 (TI99/4A format)
Obsidian
Pink Panther: Passport to Peril
Pink Panther: Hokus Pokus Pink
Driller/Space Station Oblivion
Halls of the Dead: Faery Tale Adventure II
Besides these games, we’d appreciate it if you could check our release testing list. Maybe you’ll even find your favorite game on there that has been sitting on that shelf for way too long - otherwise, there are some demos of these games available on our website.
And since ScummVM is about playing games in general, we’ve seen notable changes across many, many engines - so this is the perfect time for giving your favorites another go.
As usual, we are not just adding support for new games. We are constantly working on improving the engines we already support and, in particular, we’ve seen some incredible work being done on the SCUMM engine. Yes, there are the usual bug fixes, but this time we are also adding a feature that helps playing the SCUMM games in a truly original fashion: Support for the original loading and saving dialogs within the GUI!
Speaking of truly original: Remember those old CRT displays we had back in the day? With ScummVM 2.7.0 you’ll be able to replicate this experience on certain platforms thanks to our new shader-based scalers. Go ahead and give it a try!
All testing must be done with stable builds, not development ones. Please report any bugs or oddities on our issue tracker.
A detailed list of all exciting new features and fixes is available in our NEWS file.
Thank you very much for your support! Let’s make ScummVM 2.7.0 a great release - together!
