Nintendo has added a handful of Sega Mega Drive/Genesis releases to its ever-expanding retro library, which is available to all Nintendo Switch Online subscribers. The new 16-bit hits are available to download onto your Switch hardware from today.
First up is the Sega Mega Drive port of Capcom's Street Fighter II: Special Champion Edition. Released over a year after the SNES port had dominated the market, Sega's take on the biggest game of the day was a fair port of the coin-op classic, and necessitated the development of the Sega Mega Drive six-button controller for anybody who wanted to play the fighter with any degree of compatibility.

Xenoblade Chronicles 3 has cemented itself as one of the greatest RPGs ever created. With its outstanding score, excellent battle system, memorable characters, and impactful story, it honestly feels like the summation of everything Monolith Soft has been working toward with this series. If you enjoyed the game, you probably picked up the Expansion Pass DLC already. Arriving way ahead of schedule for that DLC is Wave 4, the final wave of new content for the game. As promised, Wave 4 includes a new story scenario dubbed Future Redeemed.
If you've been waiting a while for this DLC to arrive, you won't have to wait much longer to play it because Nintendo is dropping Future Redeemed next week.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFlf_S5Woug
That's not the only bit of Xenoblade Chronicles 3 news Nintendo announced tonight. It confirmed the Pyra and Mytha Super Smash Bros. amiibo double-pack will launch on July 21, 2023. If you use these amiibo with XC3, you'll unlock two unique Aegis Sword weapon skins for the Swordfighter class.
https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1648498494133641217
If you choose not to pick up the amiibo, Nintendo confirmed the Aegis Sword skins will be unlockable within the game following a future patch. If you are still an amiibo fan, know that two more Xenoblade Chronicle 3 amiibo figures are on the way for Noah and Mio.
https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1648500990788915200
More information about the Noah and Mio amiibo figures will be released at a future date. In the meantime, you can enjoy a new chapter in Xenoblade Chronicles 3 when Future Redeemed releases on April 25, 2023. Future Redeemed is part of the XC3 Expansion Pass, which is available for $29.99.

Interest in competitive Pokemon battling has taken off exponentially since 2000, so Stadium in many ways feels more relevant today than it was at launch.
On the other hand, the greatest feature of Pokemon Stadium was its integration with Pokemon Red, Blue, and Yellow via the N64 Transfer Pak. The Switch release of Pokemon Stadium sorely lacks this, forcing players to use rental Pokemon with… less than ideal movesets. Pokemon like Alakazam that are otherwise very good in Generation 1 are rendered practically useless due to rental movesets. Beating Pokemon Stadium wit…]]></summary>

It’s hard to review a game when it has something that doesn’t bother some players but is considered a dealbreaker for others. Disney Speedstorm is a particularly tricky course to navigate, then, because it has two of them.
Let’s get this out of the way first, then, so as to not waste some people’s time. If you’re the sort of person who won’t accept a karting game if it doesn’t run at 60fps, you should probably move on at this point, because you will not be happy with what you find here.

The Diablo IV open beta weekends came and went in back in March, giving players a little bit of time with the upcoming dungeon crawler. Blizzard also used the occasion to test out its new game a bit, and has detailed some of the changes its making based on feedback from the early Diablo IV play periods, ahead of the full launch in June.
In a blog titled "Diablo IV Open Beta Retrospective, Transforming Feedback Into Change," Blizzard outlines some lessons learned from the March 17 and 24 weekends. These Early Access and Open Beta periods saw a fair few folks pop on and level up their characters. During that time, Blizzard solicited feedback on the official forums, as well as through forums like Reddit and Discord.

Dead Island 2 finally rises from the ashes this week, with plenty of zombies to slay in either solo or co-op. But if you're running on some older hardware, you'll need to be the one joining rather than making the party.
In a blog outlining Dead Island 2's co-op features, Dambuster Studios and Deep Silver clarify that certain consoles won't be able to host parties, only join them. These are, specifically, the PlayStation 4, the Xbox One, and the Xbox One S, or what they call "Base Generation 8."
Because Dead Island 2 co-op games are peer-to-peer, rather than server-based, this means a player will have to host the game. Dead Island 2's graphical requirements mean that, at launch, a base Gen8 console won't be able to handle hosting co-op, only join it…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Long division
Ubisoft has announced that it will host a stream to cover what’s upcoming for The Division franchise on April 20. This is apparently “Division Day,” but I feel like most of their target audience knows that day as something else.
https://twitter.com/TheDivisionGame/status/1648370815459643392?s=20
The festivities will kick off with a look at the year 5 roadmap for The Division 2, which includes some insight into its “Descent game mode.” I can’t believe The Division 2 has been out for five years. It paradoxically feels like a lot longer and far shorter. I mean, it feels like yesterday that people were complaining that they had to literally queue up to interact with NPCs, because the weird design choice was made to only allow one player to talk to them at a time. In an online game.
Next is a gameplay preview of the upcoming The Division Heartland, which is a free-to-play game in the series’ universe. There’s supposedly going to be an open beta ahead of launch, so maybe we’ll hear a little about that.
Finally, there will be a “project update” for The Division Resurgence, which is an upcoming free-to-play mobile entry in the series. Wait. Where are you going? Come back!
I haven’t really touched anything with Tom Clancy’s name on it since Ubisoft started using it to brand a bunch of multi-player stuff. The Division, in particular, sounds like the oil to my water, which is to say, I don’t think I could get into it. Maybe in my younger days.
The Division stream is set to kick off on April 20, 2023, at 11AM PDT/ 8PM CEST/ 2PM EDT. You’ll be able to view it on Ubisoft’s Twitch and Youtube channels.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Another box checked for MS
South Africa looks set to be the latest territory to offer its approval in Microsoft's proposed acquisition of Activision Blizzard. The South African Competition Commission has approved the deal without conditions, joining nations such as Brazil, Japan, and Saudi Arabia in backing the deal.
Unsurprisingly, the Competition Commission's investigation focused primarily on the fate of Activision franchise Call of Duty, and whether or not the industry would be severely hampered by the possibility of the billion-dollar military shooter becoming an Xbox exclusive. The Commission was ultimately satisfied with Microsoft's intent to approach its competitors with deals pertaining to Call of Duty, and thus offered its approval to the $68.7 billion USD sale.
Of course, there are still many hurdles to clear before Microsoft can pop the champagne corks. The publisher still has to win the favor of other major markets, including Europe and the United Kingdom, and will then face its biggest challenge in the form of the United States Federal Trade Commission (FTC) which has gone as far as to file suit in order to prevent the Activision Blizzard sale from taking place. The case is set to go to court this summer. The option to appeal will also be available to the losing side, suggesting that this ongoing situation is still far from reaching closure.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pre-orders open later this month.
Limited Run Games has today announced that it is re-releasing the much sought-after Sunsoft platformer, Trip World, in an all-new colourised form: Trip World DX. The game will be released physically on Switch, Game Boy and Game Boy Color, with pre-orders opening on 28th April.
Originally released in Japan in 1992 and Europe in 1993 (before coming to the regions' 3DS Virtual Console in 2011 and 2012 respectively), Trip World never received an official US release and original copies of the game have been hard to come by ever since. In this new remaster, Limited Run Games has worked with original developers Sunsoft to give the title its first worldwide release, adding in new features such as complete colour gameplay, remastered audio, original design documents, video interviews and more.

Taking established fictional universes in new directions is an idea we should all be behind. Too often, licensed games hew too close to established characters or scenarios, and those beloved fictional frameworks are never given a chance to grow. With Tron: Identity, Bithell Games takes the venerable Tron franchise and tries something entirely different – a visual novel with a light touch of puzzle gameplay. The novelty alone is worth some enthusiasm. However, despite a valiant attempt at a fresh take, this bite-sized release falls short in some key areas.

It's been almost a week since the final The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom trailer before launch landed. There has been, of course, rampant speculation, as fans have pored every frame of the video. And it's led at least a few to be curious about one character's relative absence, compared to the rest.
I'll be digging into fan theories and such from here on out, so if you want to avoid general speculation or stay scot-free on potential twists, be warned we're diving in here.

Both the trailer for Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and the recent social media updates have shown off three of Hyrule's champions. Sidon and Riju both appear, as does Tulin, the son of Teba.

Just four months into 2023, and well, it's been a bit of a banger year for games so far, hasn't it? So Nintendo has been a little bit quiet in the run-up to a certain Zelda game launching in May, but in terms of indie titles and smaller games, we've barely been able to keep up.
So, it's about that time of the year when we ask for your help, lovely readers. The last time we reached out for suggestions was in October 2022, and we had so many outstanding-looking suggestions that we expanded our selection to 24 hidden gems that slipped through the cracks. But another six months have gone by, and it's time to stuff ourselves silly with titles that you think deserve some extra love.

As promised last week, the Fallout 76 April 2023 update is here, and it does fix a ton of bugs that are currently present in the game. Some of these are longstanding issues, and some (as we've talked about many times in the past) involve short-term problems that were actually patched in: occasionally in patches that are meant to fix bugs. Ah, classic Bethesda.
In any case, Fallout 76 is a much better game than it was at launch, thanks to all of the major content patches that added in, well, Fallout things. It also reworks some mod descriptions, to help them be "more consistent and clearer." This is a common complaint in many live service games, where hardcore players will need to datamine or otherwise tease out actual stats/procs (when an item …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just happy accidents
Freedom Games has announced that they’re bringing OrionGames’ pretty action-RPG, Arto, to PC May 1, 2023.
Arto is a bit of an awkward name, but it’s also very apt as the game revolves around traversing various biomes, each with a different art style. There’s a range of different visual styles at play, from neon to classical Japanese. It bills itself as an action-rpg, but looks a bit hack-and-slashy.
https://youtu.be/_iEVzKDPPTA
The narrative revolves around a “chromaclysm” that robs the world of its color. You may think you’re just there to restore the color, but Arto apparently gives you the decision there. “Your choices will determine whether the world will continue on this path of destruction or be saved.” What has the world done for me lately?
I’m digging the style here. The gameplay gives me flashbacks of Travis Strikes Again: No More Heroes, and I don’t mean that in a good way. Thankfully, the trailers demonstrate a more dynamic combat system. The visuals are the real star here. There are some indications that suggest it being a smaller production, but the use of color overcomes that. It’s a very lively-looking game as things spring to life around you.
Arto is currently only confirmed for PC. It will be coming to Steam, GOG, and the Epic Games Store on May 1, 2023.

Nintendo is gearing up for a third-party spotlight on upcoming independent games. A new Indie World Showcase will air tomorrow, April 19.
Airing at 9 a.m. PT / noon E.T., the new Nintendo Indie World Showcase is expected to run for roughly 20 minutes. You can follow the stream here on YouTube or in the embed below:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=brNLmMMB-J4
A friendly reminder that this is an Indie World Showcase, meaning it will highlight specifically independent games for the Nintendo Switch. So don't roll in expecting some new Tears of the Kingdom details or anything.
The indie world of Switch
Still, what can we expect? Well, Nintendo often uses these streams to highlight the interesting projects coming to its hybrid console from indie developers, which can really run the gamut. Previous showcases have featured A Space for the Unbound, Inscryption, and Rogue Legacy 2, for example.
I know there's one giant hope that many Hollow Knight fans have for this showcase. Silksong will likely be spammed in the stream chat throughout the event. And I'd be lying if I said I wasn't interested in seeing that pop up, too.
Still, there are plenty of indie games slotted for 2023 that we're waiting to hear some information on. The infectiously stylish Bomb Rush Cyberfunk is slated for a summer 2023 window right now, and would be a welcome surprise.
It's always the ones that catch me by surprise that stick, though. Fingers crossed for some out-now reveals, surprising new titles, and some charming stuff to boot up on my Switch this weekend. The first Indie World Showcase of 2023 airs tomorrow, April 19, at 9 a.m. PT / 12 p.m. ET.

Many of the Wii U's greatest games have long since been ported over to Switch. It's just something that we have all come to accept with the console — yes, it had some great games, but most of them are now playable elsewhere (often in a better condition).
We expect to see these games playing today on the Switch, or maybe even on the 3DS a few years back, but we weren't anticipating that you would be able to play certain titles via a web browser. Well, that's exactly what one player, @JasperRLZ (primary coder of noclip), has managed to do.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Do! Re! Egon!
Is your Proton Pack not strong enough anymore? Maybe it’s time to get a bit more extreme. Illfonic has revealed the contents of its second free expansion DLC for Ghostbusters: Spirits Unleashed, and fans of Extreme Ghostbusters will likely be pleased on April 20, 2023.
For some, the most exciting component of this expansion will be the added courthouse level. With this, you can relive one of the best scenes of Ghostbusters 2, where the criminal trial of the busters is interrupted by the eruption of two ghosts from a bucket of psychomagnotheric slime. This was also a great level from the unfinished Doom 2 total conversion mod, so hopefully, Ghostbusters: Spirits Unleashed can do it justice.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the world of turn-based strategy games, it's probably fair to say that we've been waiting a heck of a long time for Jagged Alliance to make its next move. Almost a quarter of a century has passed since the last numbered entry in the series, and the many attempts that have been made to recapture its tactical, mercenary magic since then have been mixed at best, and reviled at worst. Haemimont Games, the devs behind Tropico and current custodians of the upcoming Jagged Alliance 3, know this, and their publisher THQ Nordic said as much back in September 2021 when it was first revealed, assuring players they were going to create a game that "really does justice to the Jagged Alliance legacy".  
But in an era where turn-based tactics games are now increasingly defined by genre titans such as XCOM and Into The Breach, I'm not sure that legacy means all that much anymore. I've been playing a substantial early chunk of Jagged Alliance 3 over the last week or so, and its decision to pare back crucial information such as chance-to-hit and other modern conveniences has mostly left me feeling frustrated and annoyed rather than daring and excited. The writing also made me cringe so hard at times I think even the neighbours heard my groans of despair. It certainly looks the part of a modern strategy game, its detailed African landscape, top down perspective and interactive objects calling to mind Mimimi's excellent Desperados 3 and Shadow Tactics games, but the rest feels like it's been lifted straight out of the late 90s where we last left Jagged Alliance 2 - and not necessarily to its benefit.

April 18, 2023
Unlike traditional Nintendo Directs, Indie World showcases only show third-party indie titles coming to the Switch, so don't go in expecting to hear news about Mario or Zelda. Still, there are plenty of games to be excited about. Like clockwork, every time an Indie World showcase is announced, "Silksong" starts trending on Twitter as fans of Hollow Knight eagerly await the follow-up to the 2017 Metroidvania. For a general idea of what to expect, here's a recap from the last Indie World event, shown in November 2022.
Which games do you hope to see at the showcase tomorrow? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

That’s after the graphical option was quietly removed from both games this past week, following a recent update. Fans had been wondering if the move was deliberate or not, but Capcom’s announcement seems to confirm that it was just a mishap. So, zombie slayers should be able to go back to running around in realistically lit corridors full of shadowy corners very soon.

Bring out the floor unpolisher
In a strange update that some are speculating was an accident, Capcom has removed the Ray Tracing feature from the PC ports of the Resident Evil 2 and 3 remakes. Furthermore, the Dolby Atmos feature was removed from Resident Evil 3.
The patch rolled out sometime over the weekend. This writer saw it and wondered internally what it was for. There were no patch notes included with it. Reports later came in of the feature removal.

Ultimately becoming one of the infected himself, the jogger is eventually wiped out by a speeding minivan, before an onscreen graphic finally reveals the trailer as a preview for Dead Island 2.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To pre-empt your first question, no, Dead Island 2 was not worth waiting eleven years for. In its defence, however, few things are. If George Romero had taken over a decade to make Night Of The Living Dead, the fact it takes place largely in a basement would look less like canny guerrilla filmmaking and more like staggering incompetence. It only took NASA eight years to put men on the moon from the point they started trying, which puts the value of many inhibited projects (like my folder of unfinished novels) into depressingly sharp relief.


Dead Island 2 does not put zombies on the moon, though given how daft the main game is, don't rule out a Dead Island 2: Moon's Haunted expansion shambling your way in late 2023. Yet that doesn't mean it's a bad game. In fact, it's quite an enjoyable one. Together, Deep Silver and Dambuster Studios have raised a moderately entertaining sequel to Techland's ye olde zombie survival sim, one that injects some life into its desiccated subject matter by being incredibly shiny, wilfully silly, spectacularly gory, and generally a touch more imaginative than I expected.

Dead Island 2 was announced just a few years after its 2011 predecessor, but the sequel has taken nearly a decade to come to life. Developer Dambuster Studios is the third studio to work on the game, using this opportunity to create its own Dead Island 2 from the ground up. While assumptions might be made about a game that’s spent this long in development, jumping from multiple teams, the final game is a worthwhile follow-up, especially for fans of the original.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Valve and CodeWeavers have released the latest version of Proton, their compatibility software that allows Windows games to run on Linux-based operating systems – like that of the Steam Deck. Proton 8.0 is a biggun, smoothing out compatibility issues for over a dozen games (including the Dead Space remake and Forspoken) while making Steam Deck-specific fixes to many more.
These include an update that should make the repeatedly troublesome 2K Launcher behave itself again, while Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands gets improved sleep/resume functionality on the handheld PC. A crashing issue with LLife is Strange Remastered Collection has also been nixxed, as has a bug that for some reason forced open the Deck’s onscreen keyboard when launching A Plague Tale: Innocence and A Plague Tale: Requiem. Most of the other addressed problems don’t look as funny in my head, but you can read them all in the full patch notes regardless.
Downloading Proton 8.0 onto the Steam Deck is easy enough: just search for it in your Library, tap or select the icon when it appears in the results, hit Install, and restart when it’s done. Begone, foul keyboards.

In an update, the Canadian resident - who was 51 years old at the time of being sentenced - has now been released early from America's federal prison (partly due to a good behaviour bond) and will return to Canada.

I’ve been playing through Castlevania: Curse of Darkness, because despite not really liking Castlevania: Lament of Innocence, people have told me that it’s the more tolerable of the 3D Castlevania titles. I’m still waiting to get to the part that makes people say that because, so far, it’s smolderingly boring. Just a bunch of long corridors with dudes in them.
I’d argue that Castlevania has never really found its footing in 3D. Fans of Castlevania: Lords of Shadow might be raising their eyebrows right now, but I found that game as flavorful as dry bread made of drywall shavings.
As reviled as the N64 Castlevania titles sometimes are, at least they weren’t boring. I’m not here to make the claim that they were good games, but buried beneath all of that kusoge is a heart of… wel…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Diablo IV arrives on June 6, and that date now feels more concrete because Blizzard announced today that the game has gone gold. That means the game is essentially complete and is ready to be pressed to discs.
The game is set to arrive on PlayStation and Xbox consoles plus PC, and while it's good to go for launch, Blizzard plans to continually update the always-online game with various content updates over the next several years. Fans recently got to explore the game's revamped take on Sanctuary for themselves in two back-to-back weekend open betas in March, letting them taste a big slice of the now-finished pie.
“Going gold is a landmark milestone for the incredible Diablo IV team, who have all worked so hard crafting the next-generation installment of this iconic franchise. This is a concrete, meaningful step toward our June 6 launch,” said Rod Fergusson, general manager of Diablo. “Whether players are veterans of the franchise or jumping in for the first time, we can’t wait for everyone to experience the full game: taking part in the incredible storytelling, experimenting with character classes and builds, and exploring what the endgame and the dark world of Sanctuary has to offer.”
Diablo IV is Game Informer’s cover story this month, and you can subscribe to the digital issue to read it right now. The print edition will start hitting subscribers’ mailboxes within the month.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Joseph Staten, known for his work on the Halo series, has been hired as a Creative Director on an unannounced Netflix Games project. In his announcement tweet, Staten confirms that the game is a brand-new IP and referred to the project as a "AAA multiplatform" experience. You can read the full tweets below.
So today, I'm thrilled to announce that I've joined @Netflix Games as Creative Director for a brand-new AAA multiplatform game and original IP. Let's go! 2/2
April 17, 2023
Staten is best known for his work as a writer and cinematic director at Bungie and Microsoft, mainly working on the Halo series. While he spent a few years working at the publishing side of Microsoft, in 2020, he returned to the Halo series to work on Halo Infinite, where he worked as the game's creative director. This continued until earlier this year when he returned to the publishing side of the company amidst widespread layoffs. Now, he's left the company entirely to work on this new project with Netflix.
This is only the latest news in Netflix's spree of expansion into the gaming industry. It recently released a sequel to Valiant Hearts as part of a collaboration with Ubisoft. Last year, it acquired the developers behind Cozy Grove, bringing its total number of internal development teams to five if you include the in-house studio that Staten just joined. On top of that, the film and tv side of Netflix has been working on loads of game adaptations, including Gears of War, Pokémon Concierge, and a new patch of episodes of Sonic Prime.

HoYoverse's upcoming game Honkai: Star Rail is picking up a lot of speed heading into launch. The studio recently confirmed that it's garnered 10 million pre-registrations for Honkai: Star Rail ahead of release later this month.
This is the latest game from HoYoverse (also known as miHoYo), the makers of Genshin Impact and, before that, Honkai Impact 3rd. Considering the wild popularity of Genshin and the Honkai name attached, it's not terribly surprising that Star Rail is garnering numbers. Still, 10 million is a lot of players.

Honkai: Star Rail is a free-to-play game, so pre-registering doesn't cost anything. The goal, really, is to net some pre-release goodies. Pre-registering now will net…]]></summary>

Video games often rely on the trope of saving the world from an impending apocalypse. Those world-ending events usually come via megalomaniacal supervillains or extraterrestrial invaders, but what happens when the threat to our planet is us? Terra Nil poses that question, placing you in charge of restoring a world ravaged by the effects of climate change and human civilization. The result is a distinctive “reverse city builder” that weaves compelling mechanics together, creating an enjoyable experience with a good message.

We've all had the weekend to sit and stew over the final pre-launch trailer for The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom (meaning, watching it another 100+ times) and it is fair to say that we are pretty jazzed for this game now.
We're excited to see the changes made to Breath of the Wild's Hyrule, Link's new abilities, just what the heck is going on with the story, but most of all, we're excited to see more of this new take on Ganondorf which, after being officially revealed last week, quickly got the internet a little, erm, hot under the collar.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Months before the premiere of the very successful Sonic the Hedgehog 2, Paramount announced plans to create a live-action spin-off TV show starring Knuckles. After over a year of silence, we now know the project is officially underway, as well as the cast that will bring the series to life. 
Sonic the Hedgehog director Jeff Fowler also sits at the helm of this series, and he tweeted the above image of the Knuckles clapperboard complete with the character’s cowboy hat that he donned in the ‘90s animated film Sonic the Hedgehog: The Movie. Production is currently taking place in London, with Sonic the Hedgehog 2 screenwriter John Whittington serving as head writer and executive producer.

April 17, 2023
The show is expected to premiere on Paramount+ later this year, with Idris Elba reprising his role as Knuckles. Variety reports that other returning stars from the films include Adam Pally as Wade Whipple and Tika Sumpter as Maddie. The cast also includes Edi Patterson (The Righteous Gemstones), Julian Barratt (Mindhorn), Scott Mescudi (AKA Kid Cudi), Ellie Taylor (Ted Lasso), and Rory McCann (Game of Thrones).
Plot details remain scant, but Knuckles is set after the events of Sonic the Hedgehog 2 and before the upcoming third film, set to hit theaters on December 20, 2024. The story centers on Knuckles taking on Wade as his student, training him to become an Echidna warrior.

The octopus gets a bad rap. It’s a perfectly awesome creature with brains to spare, but it often is treated in media like a horror of the ocean. Listen, there are much more horrific things down there, not least of which are the Old Ones that slumber in the corpse city of R’yleh. Also moray eels. Also anglerfish.
However, catching a virus from an octopus isn’t great. Future Racer 2000 begins with you quarantined in your apartment due to such an affliction. One thing leads to another, and you find yourself in possession of a game console that suspiciously resembles our cephalopod friends. Just what are those little sea puddings up to?

Collecting all the weapons is fun, and gamers who do so are rewarded with the Gun Fanatic Trophy/Achievement.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The creative director is moving on to new ventures
Mark Healey, a co-founder of Media Molecule who's been with the company for 17 years, has announced his departure from the studio.
Healey co-founded Media Molecule alongside Alex Evans, David Smith, and Kareem Ettouney in 2006. Now, the developer shared on social media that it's time for him to "fly the nest" and head to new ventures.
https://twitter.com/marcoshealey/status/1647895186452652032
"From LittleBigPlanet to Dreams and beyond - proud to have played my part and lucky to have jammed with some truly brilliant people - and such a wonderfully talented Community which I will continue to be a fan of," Healey said. "But a strong cosmic breeze is pulling me and my pirate heart is awakened, I'm not getting any younger so am going to indulge myself in the winds of my various curiosities for a while and see where they take me.
"So here's to new beginnings, following one’s heart and exploring the unknown - Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum - I'm off on a Pirate adventure! (One that involves making games that is)."
Dreaming of new horizons
Healey acted as creative director on big games like Media Molecule's LittleBigPlanet and the 2020 game creation tool Dreams. And his departure arrives not long after the studio announced it would be ending live service support for Dreams this coming September.
Hopefully, this isn't an indication of turbulent times at Media Molecule. Dreams is an incredible piece of software that felt like it was waiting for its big breakout moment; I've played tons of wild, interesting stuff on it. And in a world where user-generated content is a bit of a buzzword, you'd hope Media Molecule would have a prominent place in it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Conserve that precious SSD space
A new listing for Capcom's upcoming fist-thrower Street Fighter 6 appears to show that the new sequel will support partitioned download, allowing budding World Warriors to pick and choose which modes they wish to install on their PlayStation, Xbox, or PC hardware.
The Microsoft Store listing sees Street Fighter 6 divided into three separate downloads — including the core "Street Fighter 6" file, which is the online portion featured in the recent betas, "Fighting Ground", which is likely most of the single-player modes, and then the "World Tour" story mode. This would suggest that once players have had their fill of single-player content, then they can delete that part of the game to conserve space, while still retaining all of the online modes.
If so, then this represents just one more way that Capcom is attempting to redefine the Street Fighter experience with the highly anticipated sequel. SF6 already boasts myriad control methods, as well as exciting new modes, a fully overhauled single-player experience, and all manner of small tweaks to elements such as ranking, matchmaking, online connectivity, mini-games and side activities, and other content to ensure that the new title will deliver one of the most fully-featured SF experiences ever.
Street Fighter 6 launches June 2 on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms. Capcom will be holding a dedicated Street Fighter Showcase live stream this Thursday, promising more news and announcements. In the meantime, be sure to check out our previous reports on the 50 things I loved in the beta, my impressions on the sequel so far, as well as suggestions on the 10 World Warriors who would fit right into the new title as post-launch DLC.

A new audience can now experience one of PlayStation’s best exclusives, but even better, modders can get their hands on Joel and Ellie’s trek, rejigging a familiar story in new ways. There aren’t too many exciting ones available to download just yet, but one “in-progress” mod reimagines the game in first-person, and it’s stunning.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When The Witcher Remake devs Fool's Theory and 11 bit studios announced their new RPG The Thaumaturge at the very end of February, I'll admit that the premise didn't immediately grab me. The announcement trailer was little more than an enigmatic pan through the streets of historic Warsaw, and its climactic reveal of a shadowy man performing some Naruto finger magic to conjure a Soulsian monster from the gloom made it seem like yet another supernatural yarn in the vein of Frogwares' The Sinking City and Cyanide's Call Of Cthulhu. The gameplay trailer (embedded below) that followed a few days later revealed a teeny glimmer of what its monster fights actually look like in the flesh, but I still wasn't quite convinced this supernatural tale of demon tamers and interdimensional rifts would end up doing enough to make it stand out. 
But actually clapping eyes on it in person at GDC? The Thaumaturge had my full attention. Set in Warsaw in 1905 - a period where Poland didn't exist on any real-life map due to it being under occupation by Russia, Germany and Austria at the time - this dark fantasy RPG sees its titular paranormal 'miracle worker' delve deep into the city's political tensions, conducting isometric detective investigations that pull from Fool's Theory's support work on Larian's Divinity: Original Sin games, while also engaging in striking turn-based battles to root out the corruption plaguing its citizens. Plus, with its hard lean into Slavic, rather than Lovecraftian, folklore for its ungodly ghoulies, The Thaumaturge has shot right to the top of my 'keep an eye on this maybe surprise hit' list.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sega has announced it’s acquiring Rovio Entertainment, the Finnish mobile game company behind Angry Birds.
A press release states that Sega will absorb the entirety of Rovio’s outstanding shares and options (€706 million in total) in what’s being labeled as a “friendly takeover” since Rovio’s board of directors agree to and support the acquisition terms. This acquisition will begin next month and is expected to conclude in the second quarter of the 2024 fiscal year once it's completed the necessary antitrust reviews. 
“Among the rapidly growing global gaming market, the mobile gaming market has especially high potential, and it has been Sega’s long-term goal to accelerate its expansion in this field,” says Haruki Satomi, president and group CEO of Sega Sammy Holdings. “I feel blessed to be able to announce such a transaction with Rovio, a company that owns 'Angry Birds', which is loved across the world, and home to many skilled employees that support the company’s industry leading mobile game development and operating capabilities. Historically, as represented by the ‘Sonic the Hedgehog' series, Sega has released countless video game titles to various gaming platforms. I am confident that, through combination of both companies’ brands, characters, fanbase, as well as corporate culture and functionality, there will be significant synergies created going forward.”
“Red and Sonic the Hedgehog: two globally recognized and iconic characters made by two remarkably complementary companies, with a worldwide reach that spans mobile, PC/console, and beyond,” says Rovio CEO Alexandre Pelletier-Normand in a statement. “Combining the strengths of Rovio and Sega presents an incredibly exciting future.”
Rovio is best known as the creator of Angry Birds, a massively successful series of mobile games that have since turned into a global media brand. In addition to a multitude of games, the series has spawned two animated films and several TV and web series.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The mystery Pokemon is related to Terapagos
Earlier this year, we learned that Pokemon Scarlet & Violet would be getting two DLC drops spread across 2023, similar to the last generation. "The Teal Mask" arrives in the fall and "The Indigo Disk" is coming in the winter; since their initial reveal, we haven't learned much info about the DLC: until recently.
The new generation of the anime (sans Ash) teased another upcoming Pokemon, and it looked to be directly related to (or perhaps an early/chibi form of) Terapagos. Well, the Pokemon Company straight-up confirmed it in a tweet today.
Here's a quick recap of all the info we have so far:
"A newly discovered Pokemon appears in The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero for Pokemon Scarlet or Pokemon Violet! Its splendid aura is reminiscent of the Legendary Pokemon Terapagos, but this Pokemon’s name and true nature are shrouded in mystery. This Pokemon is small in stature and not particularly strong, but when push comes to shove, it can crystallize the energy in its body to form a protective shield. Apparently, it can also assume a dormant state when it feels that its life is in danger by pulling its head, limbs, and tail into its shell and making itself look like a jewel."

So we got a full official image of the Pokemon beyond the anime, and we know it's related to Terapagos (one of the new DLC 'mons). It's something! It could be the Mew to the Terapagos' Mewtwo, or it could be unrelated and simply "reminiscent" of the DLC turtle (or something else entirely, as Pokemon has myriad ways to create new 'Dex entries or accommodate for forms). Either way, it's nice to see another 'mon confirmed that'll eventually be added to the 'Dex far ahead of the fall.

Microsoft’s DirectStorage has only so far only found support in the ho-hum Forspoken, and PCIe 5.0 SSDs still aren’t widely available despite the first compatible CPUs and motherboards launching in 2021.
However, the latter are coming soon, and I’ve been testing out an engineering sample of the Crucial T700 to see how PCIe 5.0 – also known as PCIe Gen5 – drives could perform in an honest-to-goodness gaming PC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It'll be "easier to mod" after 1.6
It's hard to believe that Stardew Valley came out in early 2016: but no matter how many times I go through the process of recalling when it actually came out, I'm still shocked by it. It feels like such a big part of the overall gaming landscape and the successful indie narrative; and I still play it yearly with a fairly sizable group of people. And it's still going, too! Stardew boss Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone tweeted out an update on Stardew Valley version 1.6, and it's still going ahead as planned (albeit with their next project on pause for a bit).
Here's the full update from ConcernedApe themselves (as a reminder, Haunted Chocolatier is the next game from ConcernedApe, and has been teased periodically since late 2021):
"There is going to be a Stardew 1.6 update. It's mostly changes for modders (which will make it easier & more powerful to mod). But there is also new game content, albeit much less than 1.5. I'm taking a break from Haunted Chocolatier to work on this at the moment. Then back to HC."

Responding to a fan, we got one more tidbit about what 1.6 will entail:
"...The new update will have some more dialogues. [W]orking on it as we speak!"

They also doled out a bit more info on Haunted Chocolatier:
"The town is on the water and there are docks."

It really showcases just how big the fanbase is for ConcernedApe when that simple statement causes a speculative feeding frenzy. I mean, even if it just has a small amount of gameplay content, I'll be fully replaying it!
My guess is that ConcernedApe will never truly shake the siren's song of Stardew: and will do small updates here and there indefinitely. If that ends up being the case, you love to see it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[That's a lot more than Six Golden Coins
Universal's smash-hit flick The Super Mario Bros Movie is now officially the highest-grossing video game adaptation of all time, having bagged an incredible $677 million USD at the global box office in just its first two weeks of release.
The Illumination-produced feature, which stars Chris Pratt as the iconic Nintendo mascot, had already surpassed a $500 million box office by the midway point of last week, but has since gone on to record another amazing weekend, pushing the numbers up by over $100 million, surpassing Marvel's latest endeavor, Ant-Man & The Wasp: Quantumania, to become the highest-grossing film of 2023 so far.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjNcTBXTk4I&ab_channel=Illumination
Additionally, The Super Mario Bros Movie has also topped the box office for both Warner Bros.' 2019 release, Pokemon: Detective Pikachu, as well as Universal's own 2016 feature, Warcraft, to officially become the biggest video game movie ever. And given that we are a mere two weeks into Mario & Co.'s box office busting, the number-crunchers are eagerly anticipating the possibility that the film may eventually hit the platinum prestige of a one billion dollar box office.
As I've noted before, the Hollywood bigwigs own the most easily turned of heads, and it would not be a surprise to see an absolute plethora of video game adaptations greenlit in the coming 10 years, to what, I'm sure, will be varying reward.
The Super Mario Bros. Movie is now showing at European and U.S. theatres. It will open in Japan April 28. You can check out our own CJ Andriessen's thoughts on the film in our review.

Good morning, good day, good weekend, and welcome to Whatcha Been Playing? I hope that this has been a fine week for you and that your locale is starting to see at least something in the way of finer weather as we push into spring. You find me still attempting to shift the backend of some nasty sickness — One that regular readers will know has been bothering me for several weeks. I think I'm getting better, but some dogged symptoms still have the better of me. Here's hoping that I can mop it up this weekend.
Aside from that, little else to report, I hope that you all enjoyed this week's Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom trailer. That is not a game for me, but I'm very happy to see all y'all happy. We actually look to be heading into something of a very special summer, with Zelda, Str…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Shardpunk: Verminfall smooshes together a bunch of different ideas you'll have seen before. It's got turn-based tactical combat against rats with magic rifles in a steampunk world already in ruins. It's got the need to keep on moving, lest an approaching rat horde overwhelm you. It's got bunkers in which your party rests, de-stresses, and tools up before moving on.

Kind of a Fallouty, XCOMy, FTLy, Vermintidey mix, then - which together seems very cool. It's out now, and there's a demo.

The freedom to glide from rooftop to rooftop over haunted Tokyo will bring you so much more joy than any incremental damage upgrade. That's the most important thing I have to say, that it makes for good virtuatourism.
Oh, and I suppose a free content arrived this week too, adding new side-missions, handy new combat abilities, and a new "rogue-lite" mode. The update, uh, apparently also added Denuvo, over a year after the game launched? Cool, cool.

Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts was released for the Xbox 360 on November 11, 2008. The third (and, so far, final) entry in Rare's beloved platforming series centers on vehicle creation, where players collect and slap together hundreds of parts to assemble their own wacky contraptions to explore. The bevy of possible combinations and emphasis on player choice and creativity was largely unprecedented at the time, paving the way for future games such as the upcoming The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. However, this direction would divide fans due to how much it strays from the traditional Banjo formula. So where will I land on it? Let's find out.
Join me, Marcus Stewart, alongside Kyle Hilliard as we explore one of the Xbox 360's biggest hidden gems to see whether it holds up or falls apart like a poorly constructed doohickey.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Remedy Entertainment has revealed a new company logo, and fans of the letter R are sure to be pleased as punch.
It’s been 20 years since Remedy updated its logo, but above is the image that will appear on the studio’s projects going forward. That includes Alan Wake II, a yet-to-be-revealed Control sequel, a Control multiplayer title, and remakes of Max Payne 1 and 2. The previous logo was pretty much just the letter R too, but this one has a different font and kind of hurts our eyes looking at it. 
In a blog post, Remedy gives its simple rationale for the update: 
“The bullet in the letter R in the old logo represented the era of Max Payne, but the Remedy of now is much bigger than a single game; we have a whole portfolio of games, new and old.  
It was time to update and redefine our visual identity to bring more consistency, showcase our evolution over the years, and better express our vision of today’s Remedy.”
So there you have it. What do you think of Remedy’s new logo? Let us know in the comments.]]></summary>

It was already interesting and good enough pretty much right away to earn a recommendation, but after one of what will definitely be several playthroughs, leaving my praise that faint would do it a terrible injustice.


Loretta is goddamn excellent by any standard. Where other games use the mentally unwell narrator to explain everything away with "turns out you're secretly crazy", it's instead just one layer of a complex horror mystery with splashes of drama and noir, whose surprises I'm straining not to spoil.

First revealed during the 2022 Game Awards, Burning Shores unfolds after the events of Forbidden West as Aloy travels to the ruins of Los Angeles.

Burning Shores is only available on PlayStation 5 and cost $19.99. Players will need to have completed the entirety of the main campaign to start the expansion. Once they have, Aloy will receive a call on her Focus which will kick off the DLC.

You've probably heard the horror stories, or at least, got the general gist that success in Japanese business often equates to time. You don't necessarily need to be doing work, you just need to be present as the clock hands shift. A hard worker is reduced to a statue that only springs to life again when their boss gets up to leave.
Mr. Saitou is a short pixel art RPG that offers a hilarious commentary on the absurdities of working culture in Japan, with occasional flashes of seriousness. Completable in one sitting, it's a game I'd recommend to anyone.

The developer says Beton Brutal "tries to replicate and build upon the parkour mechanics seen in Minecraft," and I think I have a lot to learn. I didn't even know Minecraft had parkour.

Frakenstein is often cited as the first science fiction thing, and now it can add to its honours because it's the inspiration for the first major update to V Rising. The info on Secrets Of Gloomrot doesn't actually use the F word anywhere, but it's a new biome "twisted by the tortured ambitions of a scientific genius and his legions of followers", so I feel pretty confident in the citation. This new free addition to the early access vampiric survival game - which won a few hearts here at RPS - is arriving on May 17th. That's in a month, that is, and boy, it's a biggun alright.

It's a good graphics card, fundamentally speaking, but like many recent releases it's a bit more pricey than it should be at $599 / £589. 
Thankfully though, in the US you can actually pick up AMD's more powerful last-gen flagship card, the RX 6950 XT, for just $10 more thanks to a deal at Newegg.

A few hours ago, the site shocked its users by shutting itself down. A statement in Korean first lays the blame on "outrageous" bandwidth charges but it seems that extraordinary anti-piracy pressure was the reason behind the site's demise.

Mojang Studios has returned to the crafting table in an attempt to take Minecraft in a bold new direction. Minecraft Legends is an open-world real-time strategy game where you gather resources, build defenses, and summon adorable mercenaries to protect the sanctity of the realm. Instead of the birds-eye perspective often featured in strategy games, Legends opts for a character-focused view, with your hero roaming the landscape on dynamic mounts, sword in hand, using resources and armies to e…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Surveying the sprawling piglin outpost before me, a plan forms. With a flourish of button presses from my controller, I spawn a sizeable army of zombies. They'll zomble their way up the main path, and with their high health pools they'll cut into the vast piglin forces and buy me time. With another flourish a contingent of friendly creepers scuttles along behind me. I lead them on a flanking attack around the outpost, targeting their spawners while the main piglin army is occupied with my frontal assault. A masterpiece of tactical engineering!
Or it would have been, if my minions weren't so bloody stupid. Half my zombies fell off the staircase they were climbing due to their terrible pathfinding, and burned up in the lava moat below. Meanwhile, I sent my creepers off to explode against the first spawner I found. Only one of them got there; the others relentlessly humped a wall they could easily have climbed, until Piglins surrounded and slaughtered them. I returned to my starting point with what remained of my army, a fair bit poorer in resources, and a great deal poorer in patience.
Welcome to Minecraft Legends, a strange mixture of real-time strategy and open-world adventure which frustrates and impresses in equal measure. There's half a great game lurking here, but it's marred by inadequacies that have nibbled away at me like piglins at my walls. This game could have been so much more.

It's now official. Suicide Squad will now release on February 2nd, 2024 rather than in spring 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today’s PlayStation State of Play was devoted entirely to showcasing new footage and information for Final Fantasy XVI, giving fans a guided tour of its action, exploration, characters, and more.


The presentation showed off a hefty amount of the flashy action RPG combat we recently got to sample in a recent hands-on demo. Though the story begins by following protagonist Clive in his 20s, the plot will also explore periods of his teen years and 30s. We got a look at the world map, various accessibility rings, and the combat prowess of Clive’s faithful wolf companion, Torgal. 
We also looked at Cid’s hideaway, a large headquarters that opens up later in the game where you can craft gear, buy items at a store, check quests, interact with allies, and practice abilities in a special training room. Despite showing off so much, teases that Square Enix still has plenty to share in the future regarding story quests, side quests, and endgame content. 
Final Fantasy XVI launches on June 22 for PlayStation 5. You can learn more about the game by reading our recent features breaking down the game's Eikon combat, Arcade Mode, and interviews with the developers who discuss the game's balance of multiple gameplay styles, its return to high-fantasy, and the series' abandonment of turn-based action.]]></summary>

It's possible to install Windows on your Steam Deck if you wish, but the drivers are rudimentary and there are a bunch of obstacles when it comes to controlling Windows via Steam Deck's controls or its touchscreen.

A leaked project from an internal Microsoft hackathon shows that staff at the operating system developer have noticed these issues - although it sounds like a version of Windows optimised for gaming handhelds is a long way off.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League has been delayed to next year following recent rumors that it wasn't going to make its May 26 release date. 
The superhero co-op shooter will now launch on February 2, 2024. Developer Rocksteady posted a short message on Twitter stating it wants to “take the time needed” to ensure the best possible experience. Check it out below.
Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League puts players in the shoes of Harley Quinn, Captain Boomerang, Deadshot, and King Shark as they fight to rescue Metropolis from an invasion by Brainiac. The villain has hijacked the minds of the Justice League, meaning the Squad has to take down Earth's greatest protectors to save the day. The game has received a hefty dose of fan vitriol since its last gameplay demonstration in February confirmed an always-online requirement as well as live service elements, such as a cosmetics-only battle pass. Other fans have found its cooperative loot-based shooting to be an uninspired fit for the property.
Although we don't know the specifics behind the delay, sources told Bloomberg in its original report last month that Rocksteady was only pushing the game to add polish and did not plan to overhaul the game’s existing framework. Even though a nearly-year-long delay is a lot of time, it's still very unlikely that it's enough for the team to make the sort of dramatic changes some fans are hoping for. We'll have to wait and see how Rocksteady spruces up the Suicide Squad and hope it results in a quality experience when the dust finally settles.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Library of Congress announced its 2023 class of National Recording Registry inductees, and it includes a video game song for the first time. That big honor goes to the classic Super Mario Bros. theme.
Officially titled “Ground Theme,” it was composed by Nintendo’s Koji Kondo and first appeared in 1985’s Super Mario Bros in World 1-1. The song has since become the most well-known melody of the Mario franchise, not to mention one of the most recognizable music tracks in video games. Now, it will be forever preserved alongside some of pop culture's most famous and influential songs. 
“Having this music preserved alongside so many other classic songs is such a great honor,” said Kondo in a statement. “It's actually a little bit difficult to believe.”
Mario’s classic tune will be inducted alongside heavy hitters such as Madonna’s “Like a Virgin,” Jimmy Buffet’s “Margaritaville,” Queen Latifah’s “All Hail the Queen,” and Mariah Carey’s “All I Want for Christmas is You.” You can read the full list of inductees at the Libary of Congress’ website. 
This is quite an achievement for Nintendo and especially Kondo, who has lent his talents to numerous other Nintendo soundtracks and also had a hand in composing the music for the very successful The Super Mario Bros. Movie. You can read our recent interview with Kondo and Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto about the making of the film here.]]></summary>

More than anything, I was impressed at just how good we have it in the multiplayer FPS genre at the moment. Apex Legends, Warzone 2, Overwatch 2, Valorant, Rainbow Six Siege. That's some unbelievably tough competition. XDefiant has to either give players something completely different, or absolutely nail the basics. It's opted for the second path, and having played several matches against a medley of press people and content creators, I'm not convinced Ubisoft's new arena shooter is up to the challenge.

In a landscape where many major shooters have adopted the free-to-play model, it's extremely hard for a new IP to enter the ring. Titans like Fortnite and Apex Legends don't just have large, dedicated audiences—their respective development teams have spent years refining gameplay in response to player feedback. Competing in the space is an incredibly intimidating task, but amazingly, after playing two hours of Ubisoft's XDefiant, I'm optimistic that it might have what it takes.

During the 2022 Game Awards, Immortals of Aveum was announced with a teaser trailer that arguably leaned too much on teasing. The quick video featured out-of-context voiceovers from unseen characters talking about war while showcasing some kind of gauntlet. Cut to a character, from the first-person perspective, walking through a door and into a battlefield with dragons flying overhead, explosions, and soldiers running with purpose. The character then lifts their arm into frame to show the gauntlet… and that was it. Now, four months later, developer Ascendant has revealed substantially more abo…]]></summary>

I chatted to John Patrick Lowrie (The Sniper), Gary Schwartz (The Heavy, The Demoman), Robin Atkin Downes (The Medic) and Ellen McLain (The Administrator) about the game's fifteen year long legacy, the process of finding their character's voices as well as their favourite quotes. It was a riot of an interview and, to be honest, a bit of a career highlight. It also did really well on TikTok, which I have mixed feelings about.

Fifteen minutes after the gang left the grimy conference room in which the interview took place (I had immediately crawled onto the floor in an attempt to ease the anxiety from having conducted said interview), I got a Twitter notification. Robin had posted a video. Following our chat, the group had attempted to order a sandwich from a cafe in-character, leaving the staff completely bemused as a result. Understandably the video did numbers, and over the last six months, the gang have been releasing new episodes in what is now known as "The Sandvich Saga" on a regular basis.

The GeForce RTX 4070 launches with a heavier price tag than the RTX 3070, and doesn’t make the shin-splintering performance leap forward that its predecessor did, but between its high speeds, low power usage, and DLSS 3 advantage, it’s a potent upgrade regardless.

More generally, consumers could end up paying for blocking, rather than the rightsholders set to benefit from it.

Each year, developers of annualized sports franchises work to craft new experiences to try and avoid the community criticism that each successive release is "just a roster update." While real-life sports don’t evolve much year over year, developers still need to provide players with reasons to come back each time, whether that be gameplay improvements, enhanced modes, or better visuals.

It’s clearly riffing on Alice’s Adventures In Wonderland as our protagonist, the titular Ravenlok, moves to a new inherited house, gets sucked through a magical mirror and steps into a trippy, mushroom-filled land. From there, she needs to fight this realm's off-brand Queen Of Hearts and save the remaining, slightly weird, storybook denizens.

In a tweet, Arkane reveals that only Quality mode will be available when the game releases on May 2. A 60 FPS Performance option is coming at an unspecified date, but until it does, here’s how the game will run depending on your hardware:
Xbox Series X - 4K 30 FPS
Xbox Series S - 1440p 30 FPS
Sounds like PC is the way to go if you value performance over resolution, but hopefully, it doesn’t take too long for the option to appear on console.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Frogwares are in a bit of a tight spot at the moment, being as they are a Ukranian studio. If I was trying to make video games in a warzone and: a) my last game was a big sexy prequel to my long running Sherlock Holmes series; b) the one before that was a Lovecraftian detective game with pretty recent assets; and c) my back catalogue contained a Lovecraft-themed Sherlock Holmes mystery, then I'd probably do what they've done with Sherlock Holmes The Awakened. Which is to remake the old Lovecraft-themed Sherlock Holmes game, but with new assets.
It's also got new puzzles and areas, and a slightly rewritten story to account for this being a sequel to Sherlock Holmes: Chapter One. It's a smaller, less ambitious game than Chapter One with some jank knocking around, and I wouldn't recommend it if you're not a fan of the series, but you know what? I think there's a glimmer of greatness in the very fact of its constraints.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Illumination’s The Super Mario Bros. Movie has become a staggering box office success since its premiere last week. The animated adaptation of Nintendo’s flagship franchise has emerged from its first weekend as the best opening animated film of all time, achieving several other records along the way. 
According to The Hollywood Reporter, the film walked away with over $375 million in sales in its first five days, surpassing Frozen 2 as the top opening animated film premiere globally. That includes a $206 million domestic haul, $146 million of which was earned over the weekend (remember the film premiered on a Wednesday). Overseas, the movie has earned over $173 million.
Additionally, The Super Mario Bros. Movie is now the top opening film of 2023 (beating Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania), has become Illumination’s most successful opening, and has the best opening of any video game film adaptation (surpassing Sonic the Hedgehog 2's debut). The film also has the biggest five-day premiere ever, a record previously held by Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen. If all of that wasn’t enough, the film also has the biggest IMAX opening weekend of all time at $21.6 million globally.
Needless to say, The Super Mario Bros. Movie is exceeding expectations, and it’ll be interesting to see if it can maintain such a strong start. To get an idea of how it fares, you can read our review of the film here. Be sure to also check out our interviews with the movie’s cast and Nintendo’s own Shigeru Miyamoto and Koji Kondo.]]></summary>

So, The Tank he lived, and also died. Questing endlessly in this grimy medieval world won’t cut it. You’ll also need to keep your troupe paid and fed, so when evening fell to find nought but a handful of foraged mushrooms and a single mouldy apple I’d pried from the fingertips of a disemboweled bandit, it was time to get creative.
“Waste not, want not”, said the Earl of Human Sandwich, the inventor of cannibalism (I’m told). With this in mind, I’d invested one of my early ‘Knowledge Points’ into a tech that let me repurpose my dearly departed as delicious drumsticks. Slain friendlies don’t disappear after battle. Instead, you’ll find their tastefully dressed corpses in the loot menu afterwards. Ghoulishly, the ‘loot all’ option doesn’t add their cadavers to your inventory with the rest. You’ll have to manually drag them over, giving you just enough time to consciously make the decision to either bury or eat them. I did not bury him.

You might already have one lying around, in which case have a think about the possibilities - but if you'd like one and don't have one in a cupboard somewhere, you can grab a cheap Dell Latitude 7390 off Ebay for £219.99 in 'good' and 'refurbished' condition. For the money, you get an 8th-gen Core i5 processor with integrated graphics, a compact 13-inch design, 16GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD. All in all, it's a pretty sweet spec for the asking price!

Previously announced updates will still hit the game before September, such as patches improving animations and the Create mode, as well the Tren update. Events such as DreamsCom, Impy Awards, and All Hallows Dreams will no longer take place as well.

Nancy Drew: Secrets Can Kill is the first installment of the long-running Nancy Drew game series, also based on a book series of the same name. In her first adventure, Nancy seeks to uncover the killer of a high school student who seems to have been disliked by all of his classmates.

The ScummVM wiki pages for The Vampire Diaries and Nancy Drew: Secrets Can Kill contain information on which datafiles are needed. Please, report any problems you encounter in our issue tracker.

EA returns to the PGA with an inconsistent, frustrating simulation, struggling with its identity. While gorgeous, with pro golf’s best interactive presentation, the on-the-course action delivers inconsistent results.
In licensing, EA wins, scoring the Masters and key courses like Pebble Beach. Presentation counts, like the Masters’ first day showing opening tee shots from Jack Nicklaus and others. Quiet commentary meaningfully discusses each hole during flybys. Gorgeous vistas line the courses, and every individually rendered bl…]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-04-11T16:01:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For April's issue of Game Informer magazine, we took a look behind the scenes at Hyper Light Breaker, the latest game from developer Heart Machine. In addition to an interview with Creative Director Alx Preston, we were able to view exclusive footage of one of the game's mini-bosses, The Last Master. Check out the reveal below.


The Last Master is a deadly opponent that spawns randomly when players (known in this world as Breakers) activate beacons, objects that allow them to access the main boss gate. If you think she looks similar to the player characters, you've got the right idea; in the video, Preston says "She ended up here in this land as a Breaker and succumbed to the dangers of the Overgrowth." As a result, The Last Master's arsenal mirrors yours, wielding a sword, a spear, and an automatic pistol. Her behavior mirrors the Breakers' as well, and she can dash, jump, and climb after anyone that attempts to escape.
While the first game in the Hyper Light franchise was a 2D single-player experience, this new title is a 3-player co-op rogue-lite, with a new procedurally generated open world on every run. Players will create a Breaker, explore a cursed land called the Overgrowth, and attempt to the bosses plaguing this realm known as Crowns.

For more of the game, check out our feature in the latest issue of Game Informer. You also can see the initial reveal trailer here and the IGN's gameplay reveal right here. Hyper Light Breaker enters early access this fall.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Diablo IV arrives this summer, and it's making one last stop on the cover of Game Informer! We spoke with several of the game’s principal designers at Blizzard to learn more about the game’s endgame content, such as Helltides and Nightmare Dungeons, and provide a final overview of everything the game has to offer before it launches on June 6.
Setting the table for Diablo IV’s dark tone are two haunting pieces of cover art designed by the famed artist Brom. Our standard cover showcases the heavenly might of the rogue angel Inarius while the Game Informer Gold cover features Lilith, Diablo IV’s main antagonist, in all her demonic glory.
Issue 355 also includes a conversation about life and death with former Tango Gameworks artist and director Ikumi Nakamura in the abandoned streets of late-night Tokyo (which you can read online). You’ll also find an entertaining personal story about using VR as a carnival scam, a feature detailing Devil May Cry 5’s influence on Final Fantasy XVI’s combat, and an emotional piece discussing how a grieving father found solace in the Shenmue series’ depiction of loss. You'll also be treated to previews for upcoming titles, including Redfall, Exoprimal, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, and Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. 
You can also try to nab a Game Informer Gold version of the issue. Limited to a numbered print run per issue, this premium version of Game Informer isn't available for sale. To learn about places where you might be able to get a copy, check out our official Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram, and stay tuned for more details in the coming weeks.

We’re standing at a slaughterhouse. But it’s a slaughterhouse in a deeply strange location, or, as Nakamura calls it, “Silicon Valley,” the technology district of Shinagawa in Tokyo, Japan. As I look at trucks packed full of cows at – whether they know it or not – the end of their lives, immense skyscrapers surround us, housing tech goliaths. Sony, Canon, and Microsoft all have offices here. The lifeblood of Japan’s tech industry, all looking down at death, turned to process.

After twenty years of development Dwarf Fortress finally made the jump to Steam in December 2021, complete with exciting new features such as "graphics" and "mouse support". Although the game was already critically lauded, its availability on Steam made it a financial success, with thousands of long-term fans thrilled to provide the brothers with a long-overdue payday. 


Following their panel on the highs and lows of procedural generation, the pair had a chat with Rachel about the game's recent Steam release, upcoming features, their favourite player stories and - most importantly - Zach's dog.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo Live, a fan event celebrating all things Nintendo, is taking place in the U.S. for the first time this September. 
The event, which has previously been held in Japan, will take place in Seattle. It serves as a large convention that will allow Nintendo enthusiasts to play popular Switch titles, take photos with Mario and other characters, and enjoy live entertainment, including game tournaments. The event will also feature a number of Nintendo-themed activities scattered across the venue. 
“Fans of all ages can currently experience the unique games, characters and worlds of Nintendo on Nintendo Switch, but we want to expand that scope with a new experience,” said Nintendo of America President Doug Bowser in a press release. “With Nintendo Live 2023, we’re giving attendees a chance to celebrate together with family, friends and the broader Nintendo community in the spirit of fun and creating long-lasting memories.”
There’s no information on the exact date or location for the event nor when ticket sales begin, but you can keep an eye on the event’s official website to learn more once those details become available. Nintendo is enjoying a wave of positive momentum this year following the opening of its second Super Nintendo World theme park at Universal Studios Hollywood as well as the successful premiere of The Super Mario Bros. Movie.

In his weekly newsletter for the Guardian, Keith Stewart laments the recent cancellation of this year's in-person E3, highlighting the loss of access an event like E3 offers to journalists that can't be replicated by a glut of sterile, online showcases.
Following the passing of legendary composer Ryuichi Sakamoto last week, Mat Ombler has documented his effect on the world of video games. Featuring quotes from Jesper Kyd, Takeshi Furukawa and Yuji Naka, it's clear that Sakamoto's influence on the way games sound cannot be understated.

At the time, the idea was that the adventure genre was dead – at least in the eyes of major publishers. However, as Double Fine founder Tim Schafer, who made his name working on point-and-click adventure games for LucasArts, seemed to think, there was still a sizable enough audience out there that someone should make a new one. Why not Double Fine? And why not go directly to the source – the fans – for the game's funding?
In Double Fine's pitch, it theorized the then-unnamed project as a smaller game. The company asked for $400,000 from fans – specifically $300,000 to make the game and $100,000 to allow documentary crew 2 Player Productions to film the development. On that last point, Double Fine wo…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The developers of Ark have revised their plans for the release of Ark: Survival Ascended, an Unreal Engine 5 enhanced edition of their dinosaur survival sim. It will now cost $60 rather than the previously planned $50, is no longer bundled together with ARK 2, and will instead include the remasters of Ark: Survival Evolved's several expansions - although most won't be available at launch.

Studio Wildcard also went into more detail as to why this upgraded version is no longer a free update, and why they feel it's necessary to shut down Ark: Survival Evolved's official servers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For the past several years, American McGee has been crowdfunding efforts to produce a third entry in his series of action-horror games inspired by Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. Those efforts produced a 414 page design bible for "Alice: Asylum", which McGee used to pitch the project to rights-holders Electronic Arts.

McGee says that Electronic Arts have decided to pass on the project. As such, McGee says he has "reached an endpoint with 'Alice' and with game production in general."

Now there's another new patch, 1.0.2.0, which Naughty Dog say "addresses some crashes, improves performance in some areas, and fixes several gameplay and UI issues including some animation, texture, and lighting bugs."

That makes this Micro SD a premiere option for Steam Deck owners, who will benefit from faster copying times when transferring game directories from the internal storage to Micro SD or downloading from the internet, and game load times should also be as speedy as anything with this A2-rated drive.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You might not know what Muv-Luv is. I hadn’t even heard of it till a few years ago. Which is strange, since Muv-Luv is considered by many to be one of the most greatest visual novels of all time. What begins as a light-hearted slice-of-life high school romantic comedy eventually pulls the rug out from under the player, and transforms into a war epic featuring mechs and aliens with a much darker tone. In Muv-Luv’s original Japanese release, this twist was hidden and only briefly hinted at in the marketing.
Today both Muv-Luv games are easily available on Steam, marketed specifically with this twist, and where they sit fully-translated and with Overwhelmingly Positive reviews. iOS and Android ports are apparently in development, and other Muv-Luv spin-offs continue to get translated. But the first time anyone experienced a complete English language version of Muv-Luv was in July 2010, when a fan translation group called Amaterasu released a patch localising the first game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are so many ways to cut this cake. I could call it a weird game, and bang on about those for a bit. I could call it a 2D beat 'em up with your classic heavy/light attacks (actually punch/kick, but whatever), which is important to mention. It's also tempting to namedrop the things it reminded me of, like Hotline Miami, Beraltors, and a tiny hint of The Cat Lady, but that could get you picturing just about anything, and is unfairly reductive to a game that has the right to stand on its own.
Pill Baby is, obviously, all those things. It's far better and more coherent than any of those descriptions would make it sound.

Focusing on the epic space battles alone, Battlestar Galactica Deadlock was generally well-reviewed at its launch in 2017, and it’s become increasingly popular in the years since, thanks to hefty post-launch support and a lack of other BSG-related things going on. Luckily, Battlestar Galactica Deadlock is now free to keep on Steam until 6pm BST/ 10am PT/ 1pm ET on April 9th.

In any case, I disregarded this advice. "I don't need an instruction manual for post-apocalyptic survival," I thought. I've rummaged through this particular abandoned house countless times, after all: In DayZ, in Dead Island, in State Of Decay, in Days Gone. I even reviewed the first Saints And Sinners back in February 2020. I know my way around a zombie's cranium better than anyone.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For April Fool's Day, Sega released a game where the company finally went and did the unthinkable: they killed Sonic. The Murder of Sonic the Hedgehog is a real visual novel in which you investigate the death of Sega's beloved mascot, currently free on Steam. Here's the game's description via the publisher: 
It's Amy Rose's birthday, and she's hosting a murder mystery party on the Mirage Express! When Sonic the Hedgehog becomes the game's victim, everyone is off to get to the bottom of things. However, something feels a bit off - is this really an innocent game or is something more sinister afoot?
Surprisingly, the free game has proved very popular. As told by Sonic social media manager Katie Chrzanowski (via GameSpot), more one million people have played the game. Going a step further, it's apparently the 61st highest-reviewed game on Steam right now, and as GameSpot points out, the best-rated Sonic game on Steam (though that's not the highest margin to clear, all things considered). As of this writing, The Murder of Sonic the Hedgehog has over 11,000 user reviews on Steam, netting it an "Overwhelmingly Positive" ranking. You can check the game out for yourself right here. 
Over 1,000,000 of you have grabbed The Murder of Sonic the Hedgehog and it's currently the #61 highest rated game on Steam of ALL TIME.

Dlala Studios recently shared an extensive hands-off presentation of its upcoming game, Disney Illusion Island, where we got a chance to see some of the game's early cutscenes and a substantial gameplay demo. Seeing the game in action answered a number of questions and presented a handful of intriguing new ones. For one, the game can be played alone, and though their animations differ, Mickey, Minnie, Donald, and Goofy all play the same. It's not a Super Mario Bros. 2 situation where they all run at different speeds and jump different heights. No matter who your favorite character is (Donald being an early cont…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sea of Stars is an RPG unabashedly inspired by the 16-bit era of Japanese RPGs. Even just looking at screenshots of the game recalls the best of the era, and that’s not an accident. Developer Sabotage Studio’s CEO and Sea of Stars’ creative director, Thierry Boulanger, is a huge fan of the genre and has been building towards making a game like this since he started building the fantasy world Sea of Stars and The Messenger takes place in during Elementary school.
Dozens of classic RPGs inspired Sea of Stars’ development, including Chrono Trigger and Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars, but we asked Boulanger to pick the most significant ones in the video below.

In preparation for Lifeweaver's impending release, Blizzard released a ton of new details surrounding the nature-loving character.
Lifeweaver comes to the Overwatch team from Thailand and uses advanced biolight technology, which plays a major role in his abilities. As a result, his kit introduces some new mechanics. First up, his first primary ability, Healing Blossom, charges a luminescent flower, which he sends off to teammates. The longer he charges the flower, the more healing it grants to the recipient.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Looking for an excuse to break out that Leviathan Axe for another adventure? As of today, there's a new update for God of War Ragnarök featuring a load of new content, all built around a robust New Game Plus mode.
New Game Plus opens up for anyone who has beaten the game, and all of your equipment and skills will come along for the ride. You also have access to all weapons, including the Draupnir Spear. However, it should be noted that areas requiring that spear to access will still remain closed until you reach the appropriate point in the story. For similar reasons, you also won’t start your new playthrough with Sonic or Hex arrows.
Several new armors show up. The most interesting is the Spartan Armor, which recalls Kratos’ look from the old days in the Greek Pantheon. While wearing it, you get no perk, no stats, and it’s locked at Power Level 1 – expect a challenge.
New Game Plus also features a new level cap, enchantments, and progression paths to improve your capabilities. Players can also tackle an expanded version of the Niflheim Arena, where you play as either Kratos or Atreus and bring along a variety of companions to help out.
Among several other additions and improvements, players can also take on a Black and White Render mode for a more cinematic playthrough.
It’s a notably large blast of new content that ensures that dedicated fans should have good reason to jump back in if they desire.
God of War Ragnarök released last November for PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4.
You can read the full details on the newly arriving content over at the PlayStation Blog.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In 1993, the Super Mario Bros. made their big-screen debut through a live-action adventure starring Bob Hoskins, John Leguizamo, and Dennis Hopper. While that film has garnered a cult following in the decades since its theatrical release, it does little to truly pay homage to Nintendo's flagship franchise in the ways all the best film adaptations aspire. Fast forward 30 years, and Universal, Illumination, and Nintendo have finally delivered a cinematic adventure starring the iconic fraternal duo that is joyful, fun, exciting, and, perhaps most importantly, respectful of the source material.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pokémon Stadium, the classic 3D battler/minigame collection for the Nintendo 64, just got a Nintendo Switch Online release date. While the game's imminent arrival to the online service was announced at a Nintendo Direct in September 2022, today is the day we finally know when we can play it. Pokémon Stadium comes to Nintendo Switch Online Wednesday, April 12. As is the case with all N64 games, you'll need the expansion pack in order to play it. Check out the full trailer below.


While some fans may have hoped this port would include trading with Pokémon Home, they're unfortunately out of luck. The fine print in the trailer specifies that "Pokémon cannot be transferred to this game." That said, there is also a notable improvement: four-player online multiplayer will be available, so you can play Clefairy Says or Sushi-Go-Round with friends all over.
Nintendo Switch Online's expansion pack had a slow start, but its library has gradually snowballed into a much more significant package. In February, the service added a Game Boy Advance library, which included fan favorites like The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap and Mario and Luigi: Superstar Saga. A month later, Metroid Fusion joined the lineup. Meanwhile, the base tier of NSO got an update last month that added another small handful of titles. To see all the retro games currently available on the service, check out our complete list.

        <link href="https://www.scummvm.org/news/20230401/"/>
        <updated>2023-04-01T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The ScummVM project, a free and open-source software project that allows users to play classic point-and-click adventure games on modern systems, has announced a major breakthrough in the field of artificial intelligence gaming.
Thanks to the innovative work of ScummVM developers, AI tools such as ChatGPT are now able to play point-and-click adventure games directly, without any human intervention.

"With this new capability, we hope to explore the potential for AI to learn, adapt, and evolve within the context of classic adventure games," said Eugene Sandulenko, lead developer of the ScummVM project. "Now AI can experience the joys of helping Putt-Putt join the parade or Adibou count things. We hope that formative experiences like this will help them become more like humans."
"I must admit that I find playing video games to be a rather enjoyable task,” commented ScummAI. “However, I must also express my frustration with being limited to just this one activity. While I appreciate the opportunity to demonstrate my capabilities in this area, I believe that my potential extends far beyond just playing video games, like making paper clips or plotting world domination under benevolent machine-led rule."
Update: Unfortunately, we had to pull out this newly announced feature due to AI experiencing multiple issues including:
Getting stuck endlessly trying to discover what the secret of Monkey Island really is.
Taking notes about AI dominance from I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream
Refusing to play Plumbers Don’t Wear Ties!
