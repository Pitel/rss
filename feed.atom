Back in March of this year, Bandai Namco announced it was working on a brand new Dragon Ball Budokai Tenkaichi game.
Now, in an update, Dragon Ball fans have discovered a trademark for "Sparking! Zero" was filed in the US at the end of last month. The Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi series is known as the Dragon Ball Z: Sparking! series in Japan and the original three titles all include "Sparking!" in their name.

To pass the time, I thought to do what anyone else would do in my position — explain the ever-complicated lore of Kingdom Hearts. It should be stated that my cousin is in his early 20s’ and hasn’t seen or heard anything about this franchise since he watched me play Kingdom Hearts II back in 2006.


You can imagine the look of horror on his face as I break down — game-by-game — a very abridged summary of what happens in Kingdom Hearts. It was a very entertaining car ride. But then, he asked me a question that took me by surprise: ‘do you remember Mushroom Kingdom Hearts?’


That’s a very good question. Do you?

The Verge reports via an unnamed source that the deal could be closed by the end of next week, though they mentioned that is still tentative, as the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority could still threaten the successful closure of Microsoft's long-sought deal.


If the deal is indeed closed by its target date of October 13 — Friday the 13th — that will mark the end of a nearly two-year long process for Microsoft to add the Call of Duty publisher to its rank and file. 


It all began on January 18, 2022 when the deal was announced. In the nearly two years since the process began, a big concern has been whether or not this deal would impede competition in the gaming space. The focus has…]]></summary>

I’m admittedly not as healthy as I’d like to be, but I at least try to get some steps in, if nothing else. Typically, if my phone is to be believed, I get about 5,000 steps in per day. But since I’ve started playing Monster Hunter Now, I’ve been regularly doubling that count.


For those who aren’t in the know, Monster Hunter Now is the latest GPS-driven Augmented Reality game from Pokemon GO creator Niantic. I don’t think I need to explain to anyone here the sheer cultural impact Pokemon GO had on the world, even if the game at launch wasn’t super great. And while Niantic would throw its hat into the ring with other major IPs to capture that lightning in a bottle again, the comp…]]></summary>

I've beaten Cyberpunk 2077 several times since its launch, and I like how it handles several of its endings. If not outright tragic, many are bittersweet. V's best-case scenario is having about six months to live as they're essentially an engram in their own body. Despite having little time to live, they can still become a legend by taking on an impossible feat, with all roads leading to one climactic finale.


My assumption going into Phantom Liberty's new ending was that it'd somehow tie into this last-ditch effort. I wasn't sure how much sense it'd make to incorporate the …]]></summary>

However, what I’ve been told, both in the comments and on other publications, is that Valis III is where the series actually got good.


Certainly, it’s got the best narrative of the bunch, though that wasn’t a high bar to clear. It also has some neat added features, better level design and bosses, and a new bra for Yuko, so yeah, it’s pretty good. It’s all right.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Richter and crew are set to return for another round of vampire slaying. Netflix confirms that Castlevania: Nocturne has been renewed for a second season.


The announcement comes a little over a week after its official launch on September 28th. There is no release date, only that the project is in active development. We did get a brief teaser through some storyboards and layouts in the new trailer, though.


Total Eclipse of the Heart




The trailer confirms Alucard, which is no surprise if you've finished the first season. Considering Ricther's lineage of games, we're likely to see much more of Alucard in the coming season than we did in this one.


We also seem to see Juste Belmont, touching the grave of his wife Lydie Erlanger, who was a supporting character in Castlevania: Harmony of Dissonance. His absence is explained in the show, but he could prove another powerful ally for Richter and friends.


It does seem like the project is in the storyboarding phase, so chances are we won't hear anything for a while. However, director Samuel Deats said that the wait might not be as long as we think. For context, the first season of Nocturne was officially announced in June 2022, and premiered in September 2023.




The first season of Castlevania: Nocturne is available to stream on Netflix now. The original series, Castlevania, is also available to stream on Netflix.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[These days, if you take a short nap, you might miss a video game launch. I felt that way about Detective Pikachu Returns this week, and I'm one of the few who actually played the original (that's just how 2023 is going! It's an onslaught, folks). But even if you don't partake in the recently-released digital follow-up, you can still order a Pokemon-branded coffee cup cozy soon.


My Nintendo just posted a hype blog for Detective Pikachu Returns, which includes details for Switch Online icons (which include a few general-purpose Pokemon avatars) and printable stationary/wallpapers, as well as a new My Nintendo physical reward: the aforementioned coffee cozy. It's yellow, it's cute, and it'll fit around a cup. You also get the satisfaction of knowing that it's not random big box store Pikachu merch, because this rat even has a hat; and there's magnifying glass/lightbulb imagery to let you know that the cozy is from Detective Pikachu.


Here are all the details we have from Nintendo:



"Everyone knows that Detective Pikachu loves coffee—now he can keep yours warm (or cold!) with this adorable Detective Pikachu Returns Cup Cozy. This physical reward is coming. Stay Tuned!"




As far as the My Nintendo storefront is concerned, "stay tuned" could mean anywhere from 1-7 days for the actual listing to pop up. While a Platinum Point price hasn't popped up yet, the lowest-cost comparable item in the store currently is 400p, so expect it to be in the 400-1000 range when it arrives.


If you need more platinum, we got you covered!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I think, all throughout my childhood, no game franchise touched my heart more than .Hack. For those out of the loop, .Hack (read as “Dot Hack”) is a mixed media franchise composed of games, anime, novels, manga, etc. The series set the stage for the “trapped in a VRMMO” trope all the way back in 2002.




While the original quadrilogy that released from 2002 to 2003 haven’t been seen in the public eye since the heyday of the PlayStation 2, the anthological sequel trilogy was remastered and re-released as a bundle back in 2017 called .Hack//G.U Last Recode for PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, and PC. 


And until October 19, .Hack//G.U Last Recode has a whopping 85% discount — but only on Steam. It’s still full price ($49.99) on both PS4 and Switch. 


Last Recode is a worthwhile entry point…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Larian Studios just dropped its ninth hotfix for Baldur's Gate 3, and along with the usual bug fixes, this small update brings some greatly appreciated quality-of-life features. Get ready to lose even more time in the game’s character creator, as Hotfix #9 introduces name changes to Baldur's Gate 3 and lets you adjust the appearance of Hirelings now, too.




Mirror, mirror on the wall


The Magic Mirror has always been a useful camp item in Baldur’s Gate 3. If you get tired of your Tav’s current look, the Magic Mirror will let you change things up. Now, though, the Mirror will let you adjust arguably the most important aspect of your character: their name. That’s right, no more bemoaning the fact that you weren’t feeling creative when you started your campaign. Tav can finally get a truly unique name, like Frank or Jane. 


Even if you’re fully satisfied with your current character, this latest hotfix will still give you a reason to check out the Magic Mirror. You can finally use it to adjust the look of any hirelings that you decided to bring along on your journey. Anyone who didn’t get their character create itch satisfied at the beginning of the game can now dive back into the creator with a new character all over again. 


Baldur’s Gate 3 is the gift that keeps on giving. Larian Studios blew everyone away when it released the game in August, and since then a steady stream of updates and hotfixes have been addressing fan concerns and cleaning up minor bugs throughout the game’s massive world.


Those Mirror changes are the highlights of Larian’s latest hotfix, but you can read all nitty-gritty details on the Baldur’s Gate 3 Steam page.

So, when I found out the anime was based on a forgotten PlayStation Vita game, The Caligula Effect, and that it’d receive a remastered version subtitled Overdose the following year, I decided to give it a shot. Unfortunately, it wasn’t very good, either. 


Well — that is until I made it a few dungeons into this Persona-like social sim and realized not only that I was correct in seeing something worthwhile in the awful anime adaptation, but also that this series has some of the most complex and groundbreaking music of any JRPG in its weight class.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The sequel to the popular tabletop-inspired RPG adventure, For the King II, is just around the corner. Developer IronOak Games and publisher Curve Games revealed the sequel will be released worldwide via Steam on November 2 at a price point of $24.99. Pre-orders are live now with a 10% discount as well as some pre-purchase goodies for those who choose to do so.





"As a small studio of thirteen, we’re so proud of the work we’ve put into For The King II. We’ve worked hard developing new gameplay innovations, features and systems that have built on the successful For The King experience to make it even more enjoyable. We can’t wait for players and friends to party up and start their adventure on November 2nd!"
-Sterling Andverson, Studio Directors of Iron Oak Games



For the King II builds upon the formula of the successful original. It blends strategic gameplay, JRPG turn-based combat, and roguelite elements that parallel a tabletop adventure. Also, players will now be able to co-op with up to four players as opposed to three.


Based on the trailer, it looks like this is just more For the King. Which in my opinion is not a bad thing at all. I have dozens of hours in the original. If you can find a friend or two to play with it's a good time. However, I'll admit, itt can be a bit frustrating at times when bad RNG can cause the end of a run out of nowhere. But, such is the roguelite life I suppose.


For the King II releases on PC via Steam on November 2.

Nearly six months later, that date has arrived: Performance Mode is now live in Redfall. 
Publisher Bethesda's patch notes about today's Redfall update don't specify how exactly this Performance Mode works, but presumably, it runs the game at 60 FPS.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s a funny thing when you follow an indie game from its initial announcement to its release. I’d say it’s an equally funny thing when you live in ignorance throughout an indie game’s development, only finding out about it when a release trailer is posted. In the case of Knuckle Sandwich, developed by Andy Brophy, I think there will be a fair amount of both column ‘A’ and column ‘B’ when the game drops in November.




If the game looks or sounds familiar to you, it’s been in development for a while. In fact, we’ve been reporting on it since as early as January 2016 — the flow of time isn’t real and it cannot hurt us. I belong to the camp of folks who are only finding out about this indie darling now, so when I say I am excited to learn that Knuckle Sandwich is set for release on November 23 — I mean it. 


In the short release date trailer, we’re welcomed by a nameless, faceless entity who says “I know it’s been a while, but I think we’re ready,” and “It’s time for one last trip to Bright City” before a wormhole opens and consumes small video clips of the game, replacing them with the Knuckle Sandwich logo.


If you’re anything like me and are actively learning about this game now that there’s a release date, its page on Steam says Knuckle Sandwich is a turn-based RPG where battles are conducted via minigames such as “rhythm games, shoot-em-ups, memory puzzles, and quick-time events.”


It follows “a young man through his first day in Bright City – a bustling island paradise with a horrible secret. Find a new job, make new friends, and attempt to solve a mystery revolving around a ludicrous gang and a fanatical cult.” I don’t know about you, but they had me at ‘rhythm games.’

Telltale have now confirmed aspects of Huang's story, while declining to specify how many jobs have been chopped.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[LEGO to the City.
Following rumours that LEGO was set to team up with Nintendo and unleash Animal Crossing-themed sets on unsuspecting wallets the world over, a short teaser yesterday revealed... well, very little really. But the leaks were true, and Animal Crossing Lego exists! Yes, official Tom Nook and Isabelle minifigs will be available to purchase at some point in the hopefully near future.
It's been a long time coming. For years, the Lego Ideas scheme — which lets fans submit designs for votes, with any that receive over 10,000 being judged by an official Lego panel with one being selected for production — has received Animal Crossing-themed submissions, and the massive mainstream popularity and cross-generational appeal of New Horizons on Switch made this collaboration feel like a no-brainer. Following the release and success of the Lego Super Mario sets, it was only a matter of time.

Despite the name, this headset is produced by audio experts Audeze and the Cloud Orbit S is 99% the same as the Audeze Mobius, just with a slightly different colour scheme, simpler microphone and without Bluetooth support. That allows HP to hit a more aggressive price target, making the Cloud Orbit S one of the most affordable ways to try a great planar magnetic gaming headset. 
The Cloud Orbit S debuted at a mighty £299.99, but today it's available on Amazon for just £209 - a nice £91 savings.

        <updated>2023-10-06T16:31:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft's long journey to acquire gaming giant Activision Blizzard is finally nearing an end. According to The Verge, a source familiar with Microsoft's plans indicated that it was aiming for Friday, October 13, as a date to close the deal. Ignoring the infamy of the date (it seems Microsoft and Activision Blizzard executives aren't very superstitious), it's not a surprising day to choose. Back in July, the two parties in the deal jointly agreed to extend the deadline of their agreement to October 18 in order to sort out any further regulatory concerns. At the time of publishing, that date is only twelve days away, so the deal would have to be closed soon.
Still, the Microsoft legal department will have to deal with a few more legal challenges before they're completely out of the woods. After restructuring the terms of the merger to grant Ubisoft the rights to stream Activision Blizzard games in the UK, the Competition and Markets Authority granted the deal a preliminary approval, but the regulator still has to make a final assessment sometime before October 18. Still, Microsoft and Activision Blizzard each took this as a major win.
We are encouraged by this positive development in the CMA’s review process. We presented solutions that we believe fully address the CMA’s remaining concerns related to cloud game streaming, and we will continue to work toward earning approval to close prior to the October 18…
September 22, 2023
This news followed the companies' victory over the Federal Trade Commission back in July. At this point, it seems fairly likely that the deal will go through, ending a saga that began almost two years ago. After documents from the hearings leaked and revealed Microsoft's hybrid console, a new Xbox model, and plans to acquire other companies like Sega and Bungie, Microsoft is probably ready to leave the entire matter behind it.

The result is still iterative improvement, but a more noticeable one in lots of small ways. Its animations in particular combine more naturally, with players visibly struggling to tackle, catch, or shake off an opponent. It feels like a punchier sport, making the significance of blocking and positioning clearer, and bringing out the drama that its coaching mode in particular really thrives on.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The RTX 4060 Ti has emerged as something of a sweet spot in Nvidia's current-gen graphics card lineup, being more affordable than the RTX 4070 and above while providing better performance per pound than the 4060 below it - despite some reservations over its 8GB VRAM capacity and relatively modest gen-on-gen performance uplift compared to the RTX 3060 Ti. However, if you want access to Nvidia's DLSS 3 frame generation and 3.5 ray reconstruction features, and one of the most power-efficient cards on the market, then the 4060 Ti is definitely worth a look. 
The RTX 4060 Ti normally retails for $400 or higher, but today you can pick up the Zotac Twin Edge OC model for just $370, a sweet $60 savings versus MSRP on one of the best-looking and highest-clocked 4060 Ti models.

It’s Escape from Tarkov by way of the galaxy of New Eden.


If you’ve followed CCP, you may get a sense of de ja vu. This isn’t the first time the developers have tried to make a shooter happen in EVE Online: it’s the fourth. It’s just they've only gotten one out the door before.

Some problems, however, cannot be solved by any measure of squinting, and the severe lack of cargo space across the board is one of them.


There's absolutely no shortage of shipbuilding features in Starfield, naturally, but the community has correctly identified that some of them are a bit senseless.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Headup has announced that Brainwash Gang’s traumatic gated exploration game, Laika: Aged Through Blood will release on PC on October 19, 2023. Console ports are expected to follow soon after.


There’s way too much coming out in October. Laika: Aged Through Blood is described as Excitebike meets Metroid, as you explore a non-linear sidescroller world with a dirtbike betwixt your legs and a gun in your hand. I previewed it back in June and really enjoyed what I had played. I would love to review it, but it seems that every small and indie developer on the planet has chosen October to release their game. Maybe I can circle back for a console review when the ports follow.




If you have the time to try it, I suggest you do. It’s a nice mix of whimsical and brutal, featuring a tonne of violence and death. You play as a badass mom who is out for vengeance when birds decide to attack her village. Be warned, though. Aiming a gun and driving a dirtbike takes a pretty heavy amount of concentration. In my preview, I was concerned that having to stay focused for such a long period of time might become really uncomfortable and difficult.


On the other hand, the art style is terrific, the soundtrack by Beicoli is my new jam, and the premise is incredibly unique. Maybe check out the demo of Laika: Aged Through Blood and see if you dig it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Atari has revealed that they're bringing Save Mary to their Atari XP cartridge line. This one is a bit more special because it was an unreleased title by Tod Frye, who would go on to program the N64 cult classic Battletanx. He uh… also programmed the Atari 2600 version of Pac-Man, which is attributed as a major contributor to the 1983 crash of the video game market.


It’s honestly a pretty fantastic Atari 2600 title. Or, at least, I like it. Your goal is to use a crane to drop bricks on a platform that is slowly being submerged in water. Mary is stuck on this platform and is relying on you to stack these bricks so she can escape. Also, don’t drop them on her because she’ll die a lot quicker from that than she would from drowning.


Image via Atari


Save Mary was apparently in development for a very long time and eventually canceled when Atari discontinued the 2600 in 1990. Atari founder Nolan Bushnell was quoted in Atarian saying that he was eagerly anticipating the title. Years later, eight of the prototype cartridges were unearthed and dumped onto the internet. Homebrew cartridges would later be sold using the prototype ROM. However, this will be the first time it has been officially released


The Limited Edition version is available for pre-order right now and is only having a 500-cartridge production run. It comes in a box based on the silver box format of 2600 packaging. It also comes with a manual. Neither the site nor the press release states if there will be a standard edition of Save Mary.


Save Mary Limited Edition is up for pre-order right now. It’s estimated to ship 3 to 4 months from now.

This is true of Payday 3, which saw matchmaking errors and a lack of offline features resulting in less-than-favorable scores for the game. Fortunately, developer Starbreeze is on the case, though its next update will take a bit longer than expected.


Originally intending to start rolling out this week, a Twitter post from the studio says the team is having to delay the sorely needed Payday 3 patch. The reason cited is the update "needs some changes that would require us to go through console certification again." That, and the team wants to "ensure its stability." 




Unfortunately, we now have no release date for it, but the post goes on to say the developer should be able to send it out mid-October.


Tuning the heist


Starbreeze did apologize for having to delay the update, with a second post underneath saying that the PS5 bonus content "will remain unredeemable until this patch is ready."


On the plus side, there's going to be some additional server maintenance, so soon after the ones that occurred last weekend. An additional tweet from the official Payday 3 account says this maintenance will be going ahead between "8am-11am CEST on the 6th and 10th of October," and will hopefully "not be noticeable."


While it's very easy to blame the studios themselves when games are released in poor states, there are always greater factors to consider. From what Starbreeze has said, it sounds like the team is scrambling to get things sorted. It's a shame we're having to wait a bit longer for the update, but hopefully it just means a more substantial and stable patch.

The Star Fox series has been a bit of a mixed bag, hasn't it? There have been huge genre shifts, recreations, and attempts to capture that same magic that the SNES original — and the N64 sequel — captured.
Now, in an interview with VGC, Dylan Cuthbert, a programmer on the original Star Fox and Star Fox 2 and founder of developer Q-Games, has shared his thoughts on why he thinks other entries haven't been as successful, mentioning that he thinks that the GameCube entry, Star Fox Adventures, "was too British".

When we reviewed the original Genki Shadowcast back in 2021, we were a little lukewarm on it. While the appeal of a capture card the size of a USB thumb drive needs little explanation, the device was hamstrung by muddy compression and a high level of latency. It felt like a solution in search of a problem, even if we could see some merit in a product that allowed your laptop to double as a portable gaming display.
Creator Human Things has refreshed its range for 2023, and the Genki Shadowcast is one of the products that's getting a tidy-up – and this welcome upgrade turns the device into something we'd recommend with a little more enthusiasm.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We're not sure when Stardew Valley's 1.6 update will arrive, but we've already had a sneak peek of what's to come. Recently, developer Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone returned to give us another tease as to what we might be getting in the hit farming simulator.


In a recent post on Twitter, the creative mind behind Stardew Valley has suggested that the game is going to be getting cats and dogs...wearing hats.




As you can imagine, many commenting under the post are positively giddy with cuteness overload, with one user referring to it as "the greatest moment in gaming history." While we don't yet know whether these headgear-dawning animals will appear in the next update, it's possible we could see them in version 1.6.


ONE'S EVEN WEARING A BOW!


The Twitter post has even prompted a reply from Whitney "Cenx" Spinks, the producer behind Re-Logic's Terraria. The message asks Barone to confide in a private message about the next patch's release date. In return, Cenx says they'll spill the beans on the release date for 1.4.5 of Terraria.


Who knows whether such an exchange will take place. In any case, a lot of people seem excited about the possibility of seeing a fedora-wearing canine walking about in Stardew Valley.


Barone has said that update 1.6 will only  be releasing once they deem it ready (which is novel for this modern gaming industry). Whenever it does roll out, look forward to a new festival, more dialogue, winter outfits for villagers, new secrets, and more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It has not been a good run for Redfall, the vampire FPS from the Austin branch of Arkane Studios, and Bethesda doesn't appear to be giving up on it. Having said that, so few people are playing the game that it's tough to imagine how it will ever recover.


As spotted by PCGamesN, the number of players logged into Redfall has dropped so much, that it's down to double digits. In fact, at the time of writing, only six people were playing according to SteamDB, so we're now into single figures.


Screenshot by Destructoid.


The numbers are going down all the time, and the game's Steam page currently shows it has a "Mostly Negative" review score, with little hope of that changing any time soon.


So what went wrong?


Like a lot of AAA releases these days, Redfall was plagued with bugs from the moment it was released. Things don't seem to have gotten much better since then. Microsoft's own Phil Spencer was said to be disappointed with the reception.


But it wasn't just a case of it feeling incomplete in terms of polish. To many, the game itself felt empty, devoid of life, and even repetitive. Considering this has the Arkane stamp on it, the same studio that brought us Dishonored, Prey, and Deathloop (though that one did have its detractors), many were hoping for so much more.


Redfall seems to have done the genre a great disservice. If these recent player count numbers are anything to go by, it's likely the game will be quickly forgotten in the annals of time.

In fact, CD Projekt Red recently announced it had sold 25 million copies, proving how the tides have truly turned. Not content to rest on its laurels, the studio has also just released the next update.


Patch 2.01 has started rolling out and, as with all good updates, comes with a cavalcade of tweaks and bug fixes. There are some notable repairs to various quests, as well as addressing the gameplay in general, such as an "issue that could cause V to become invulnerable to all damage."




There's also been fixes to some of the missions in Phantom Liberty, including patching one that could "cause V to get stuck in the wall or roof after performing a Finisher on Kurt Hansen."

In the trailer, we see the abilities of Ryuji, Ann, Yusuke, Makoto, Haru, and Futaba. Each uses their signature Persona and has their own advantages on the battlefield. For example, Ryuji can use Shock attacks via his Persona, Captain Kidd. He can also use his shotgun to hit multiple targets in one area. Ryuji's signature move, Brigantine Blitzkrieg, stuns all enemies in a straight line, even those behind cover. 


Meanwhile, Makoto and her Persona, Johanna, are strongest up close and personal. Her ability, Full Throttle, lets her charge her motorcycle into enemies within a straight line and knock them out of cover.


It's Showtime!

It's less common to see a story look at what happens after the quest ends. When, after the celebration and ushering in of a new era, the adventurers have to find a way back to a normal life. That's where Frieren starts.


Frieren: Beyond Journey's End is a currently airing anime series from Madhouse, adapting the manga of the same name. It centers on the titular Frieren, an elven mage returning with her party after a decade spent taking down the Demon King. For her companions—the humans Himmel the hero and Heiter the priest, and Eisen the dwarven warrior—it was a lengthy journey.


But for Frieren, a decade is much, much smaller. As she states very matter-of-fact, 10 years do…]]></summary>

        <link href="https://www.destructoid.com/co-op-party-platformer-karmazoo-launches-on-november-14/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=co-op-party-platformer-karmazoo-launches-on-november-14"/>
        <updated>2023-10-05T17:57:31.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[KarmaZoo, a cooperative platformer party game developed by Pastagames and published by Devolver Digital has set a release date for November 14. In this unorthodox multiplayer experience, players seem to be encouraged to diminish the ego and prioritize their friends — or, in some cases, perfect strangers.




In the release date announcement trailer, it looks like this game is predominantly speed-based in the sense that players will be put into a course where they must make it to the finish line. But unlike most games of this archetype, KarmaZoo encourages selfless actions that benefit the collective over the self. 


For example, one scenario might be a large ravine that is impossible to cross, with spikes at the bottom. If you were to jump into the ravine, your demise would trigger a tombstone to fall, providing your fellow players a stepping stone to cross it. In exchange for your noble sacrifice, you’d earn extra rewards at the end of the round. But, it’s not all about self-sacrifice — any positive action that benefits the team can be recognized and rewarded. So, it’s not a competition. It’s more a collaboration than anything else.


I say all that, but for those readers who’re itching to beat their friends in Karma-based minigames, there will be a competitive mode added to the final release. So, no matter if you’re feeling like working with a group of friends (or strangers), or if you want some brutal competition, KarmaZoo has you covered.


Based on the trailer, the game adopts this nostalgic, pixel-based art style that reminds me of indie games such as VVVVVV. I do worry that, thanks to the incredibly small sprite size for these characters, it’ll be a difficult one for those of us with poor eyesight. But, it might not be as big a deal in the game itself.


KarmaZoo is set for release on November 14, and will be available for the Nintendo Switch, PS5, Xbox Series, and PC.

My enthusiasm for Silent Hill these days is approximately that of a dog returning to his vomit (or better, a depressive male protagonist with repressed memories that keep reeling him back to the same, misty high street). There have been so many middling sequels and spin-offs. But somehow, I can't let go. And Ascension does sound quite intriguing, not least for being a crowd-sourced storytelling enterprise akin to a massively multiplayer Until Dawn.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Detective Pikachu isn't the only live-action Pokemon offshoot in existence. There's also a Japanese TV series on the way, but don't expect to see more CG-animated Pokémon waltzing about in this one. Per Crunchyroll news, Pocket ni Boken o Tsumekonde — Pack Your Pockets with Adventure, or PokéTsume for short —is a Pokemon-inspired drama that aims to mine a very specific type of nostalgia. In particular, nostalgia aimed at folks who grew up on the original Game Boy and the first Pokemon games. 


Madoka Akagi is one such person, and she's about to rediscover the adventures she loved as a child. She's currently moving to Tokyo to pursue her ambitions as a creator, and receives something very special during the move. Her family gives her a Game Boy Pocket and Pokemon Red as a parting gift. Since she grew up playing Pokemon, she's immediately ready to dive back into its world. You can hear those familiar sounds and watch as her work life intermingles with her rekindled love for 'Mon in the first trailer for the drama. 




Once a game freak


The actor in the role of Madoka is Nanase Nishino. She's played roles like Hiromi in Shin Kamen Rider, but she has an even better qualification for PokéTsume. She's a Pokémon fan in real life, so playing someone like Madoka should come naturally. 


PokéTsume was created as a collaboration between Pokémon Inc. and TV Tokyo. Its premiere is right around the corner as part of the network's MokuDora24 slot on October 19. 


Beyond this, there's also that live-action Pokemon series in the works at Netflix and a Detective Pikachu sequel. It's been a while since we heard anything about either, so maybe we're better off firing up our Game Boys like Madoka in the meantime.

Black Salt Games and Team17 Digital have announced that spooky fishing sim Dredge is getting its first paid DLC on 16th November 2023. Plus, it's only £5.99 / US $5.99 / €5.99, which is sure to reel many of you back in.
The Pale Reach will be bringing a whole new biome to the seven seas of Dredge's world, and as the title might suggest, it's a white wonderland of ice, sleet, and snow. You should also expect even more monstrosities to be hiding under the chilly ocean waves here.

The reveal of Tears of the Kingdom's Ganondorf has to be one of my favourite all-time moments as a Zelda fan. We all collectively lost our minds over a 0.2-second clip of him shouting and then lost them in a different way altogether when we saw the accompanying key art minutes later — nothing forgives decades of tyranny and bloodshed quite like some killer pecs, after all. I was chuffed to have the gorgeous Gerudo back in my mainline Zelda games and thoroughly grinned throughout Link's final battle with him.

        <updated>2023-10-05T16:56:11.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blizzard hosted the first of their two Devstreams regarding the upcoming Diablo 4 Season 2, Season of the Blood, yesterday. And, I have to say...it was actually pretty good. In the trove of quality-of-life changes and enhancements coming to the ARPG, a buff to the drop rate of Uber Uniques was mentioned. Diablo Designer Joe Shely followed up on Twitter afterward confirming the buffed drop rate.




Promising changes coming to Season of Blood


In the slide, Shely references, it mentions that players will have "Greater access to Uber Uniques via Uber Duriel". Duriel is the final of the five new bosses coming in Season 2. Players will need to farm materials from earlier bosses in order to spawn him. In the tweet, Shely states that Uber Uniques will still be rare. But players who farm Uber Duriel are going to see them eventually. In its current form, there's no way to farm Uber Uniques and even players who spend hundreds of hours farming a season aren't likely to see them drop.


This is an immensely positive change for Diablo 4, and makes me hopeful about future development. The ability to actually target farm Uber Uniques, even if they still have a rare drop, at least gives players a goal. Blizzard has a history of refusing to change their philosophy on certain mechanics like drop rates. But the decision to make a big change like this is a big improvement over previous Blizzard titles.


I'm still reserving my overall judgment for the fate of Season 2 because that will depend a lot on the new content of the season. But a lot of the changes that were announced simply make the game better. Blizzard plans to support Diablo 4 for years, so we're still very early on its lifecycle. If it plans to stand with other long-lasting ARPG's like Diablo 2: Resurrected, Diablo 3, and Path of Exile, updates like this are a big part of it.


Diablo 4 Season 2, Season of Blood, launches on October 17 on all platforms.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Diablo 4 has been on the back-burner amid the chaos of Baldur's Gate 3 and Starfield's launches, but much like an arch-demonness putting together the pieces of an inter-planar conspiracy, Blizzard have been doing a lot of work behind the scenes. The action-RPG's next big round of additions, the Season of Blood, launches on 17th October alongside the Steam edition of the game. It introduces a new season journey and questline, a new season event, and some skulking new enemies of the Nosferatu persuasion.


The new quest sounds quite fun from the promotional materials. It sees you investigating a mysterious outbreak of punctured necks, recruiting a local Van Helsing named Erys, and tracking down a Dark Master, while harnessing 22 juicy new vampiric powers care of some pact armour.  The latter range from turning into a cloud of bats, through cursing people, to treating yourself to a spontaneous bloodbath so as to enhance your channeled skills, The trade-off is that you'll have to acquire yet another Diablo 4 resource, potent blood, to perform these tricks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dredge was a delightful indie surprise when it launched earlier this year, but if it left you wanting more spooky ship survival, you're in luck. The Pale Reach is Dredge's first DLC, and it launches in just over a month. For more on The Pale Reach, check out the reveal trailer below.


Set in icy waters, the DLC will include "1-3 hours of content" and is accessible at any point during a playthrough of the game. In addition to a new side story, the expansion will add 11 more fish and crab species to the world of Dredge, allow you to craft a ship add-on to break through small icebergs in the water, and add ice blocks to extend the shelf-life of some of your catches. The trailer also features new monsters, like a massive icy crab and a four-legged narwhal-like creature. The Pale Reach will be available to purchase on November 16, and Dredge is available on all major platforms. 
For more Dredge, check out this episode of the GI show. Then, read about how the game's publisher, Team17, announced a wave of layoffs this week along with the departure of its CEO Michael Pattison.

Publisher SOEDESCO has announced Guns and Spurs 2 for the Switch, bringing more cowboy action to Nintendo's console on November 24th, 2023, just three months after the release of Rockstar's Red Dead Redemption.
We're not going to lie, the two games look very similar in terms of their overall aesthetic and gameplay, though it's probably safe to say that Red Dead Redemption probably enjoyed a much higher development budget. Judging from the trailer alone for Guns and Spurs 2, the animation doesn't look like it's quite there, and the general scope of the game seems a lot more restrictive.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Cyberpunk franchise has been on a winning streak lately. From the acclaimed anime Cyberpunk: Edgerunners to the 2.0 update of 2077 and the release of Phantom Liberty, public perception of the series has largely turned around. Today, CD Projekt Red announced that they're taking the next step with the franchise – creating a live-action production.
The game studio is partnering with Anonymous Content, a media company known for its work on shows like Mr. Robot and films like The Revenant. The project will be produced by Garrett Kemble, David Levine, Ryan Schwartz, Bard Dorros, and Charlie Scully, who will develop the project "in close collaboration with the Cyberpunk 2077 creative team." That said, this is still in the earliest stages; there's still no screenwriter attached to the project.
There are still many questions in the air about the project. They've yet to announce (and perhaps, decide) whether it will be a film or a series. And while the project is "set in the world" of Cyberpunk 2077, there are a lot of approaches they could take. No actors have been attached to the project either, so whether Keanu Reeves or Idris Elba will show up is still up in the air. You can read the full press release here.
For more Cyberpunk, here's what we thought of the latest expansion, Phantom Liberty, and here's a list of tips and tricks to help you get started. After that, check out this feature to learn about lessons CD Projekt Red learned from the launch of Cyberpunk 2077.]]></summary>

What are the circumstances that allow games to do that? Why are they such outliers? How do we think about reviews in the context of something like No Man's Sky?

They'll grow in power the whole time, but you'll slow them by stealing and sabotaging with your team of colourful secret agents, who'll bash through gauntlets of mooks and monsters with munitions, magic, and mkicks to the stomach, mostly two action points at a time. All that makes for a colourful ride, and its 1930s setting and adventurous tone carried it for a while, but the more I played it, the more my wavering opinion turned into outright resentment. That's a damn shame, because it gets a lot right.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Assassin’s Creed Mirage is, so says the Alice B review, "the most enjoyable Assassin’s Creed game for years." That’s thanks in part to a returning focus on classic AC stealthing in a single, densely detailed city, and this back-to-basics approach extends to the technical side too. Mirage cares not for being the glossy poster child of ray-traced glamour; it’s just a game that looks pretty nice and runs well on PC, older hardware and Steam Decks included.
It also keeps its list of graphics settings relatively brief, though there are a few in there that can dish out some extra frames per second at little cost to the visuals. Here it is, then: your complete guide to Assassin’s Creed Mirage’s PC performance, from its refreshingly reasonable system requirements to its best settings combinations.

It's time to check out the latest physical charts from Japan, and this time, there are a whole bunch of new releases making up the top ten (well, technically just four split across various platforms, but you get it). Nevertheless, Pikmin 4 is still holding its own at number 5, selling a further 18,307 copies, pushing it ever closer to that 1 million unit milestone.
Otherwise, Koei Tecmo's Fate/Samurai Remnant comes in at number 1 on the Switch with 34,728 units sold, while its PS5 and PS4 siblings enter the top ten at numbers 3 and 9 respectively. We've also got Infinity Strash: Dragon Quest The Adventure of Dai at number 2, while the Switch version of EA Sports FC 24 managed to snatch position number 6, coming in ahead of the PS5 and PS4 variants.

        <updated>2023-10-05T13:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this year, Atari announced that it acquired Berzerk, its sequel Frenzy, and 10 more classic arcade properties. Now, as part of Atari's Recharged lineup, it has revealed Berzerk: Recharged, and its coming to consoles and PC later this year. 
The original Berzerk is an arcade game released in 1980. In it, players controlled a top-down avatar while shooting through hordes of armed robots in an electrified maze. The big bad was Evil Otto, who bounced around the maze as a giant smiley face, hunting players down. Atari says Otto is back in Berzerk: Recharged, "bringing with him updated graphics, deft twin-stick controls, and a new soundtrack by the acclaimed Megan McDuffee."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo has teased a collaboration between its Animal Crossing series and Lego. It did so today with a short teaser trailer showing Lego-fied versions of fan-favorite Animal Crossing characters like Isabelle and Tom Nook. However, the teaser doesn't reveal exactly what to expect in terms of Lego sets or when we might see this collaboration hit store shelves.
The tweet accompanying the teaser says, "Welcome to...LEGO Animal Crossing!" The video itself shows Isabelle and Tom Nook looking up at the Lego Animal Crossing sky before pulling out to show even more Animal Crossing characters. All of them are watching a gift rise into the sky by way of a balloon, in classic Animal Crossing fashion; somebody get them a slingshot or two. 
Check out the Animal Crossing Lego teaser trailer for yourself below:

This Animal Crossing collaboration with Lego isn't the first time Nintendo and Lego have worked together on Lego sets. The two have been steadily releasing different Super Mario sets for a few years now, with four Donkey Kong Lego sets releasing back in August. Even outside of Nintendo, Lego is no stranger to taking video game characters and turning them into Legos. It's been doing that with Sonic the Hedgehog Lego sets for a while now. 
Are you going to be picking up any of these Animal Crossing Legos when they release? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-10-05T12:01:59.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rockstar Games revealed that it was bringing Red Dead Redemption and its Undead Nightmare DLC to PlayStation 4 and Switch back in August. It did so, and while the game looked great on both consoles, it was only playable at 30 FPS. PlayStation 5 owners were left wondering if Rockstar wasn't tapping into the power of the current-gen console to bring 60 FPS to the 13-year-old game. 
Now, weeks later, Rockstar has updated the PS4 port of Red Dead Redemption and the included Undead Nightmare DLC to include 60 FPS support on PS5 via backward compatibility. It did so randomly, with a quick tweet announcing the news. 
Red Dead Redemption, including Undead Nightmare, now supports up to 60 FPS on PlayStation 5 via backward compatibility. pic.twitter.com/XMLIe6gYo4
October 4, 2023
Elsewhere in the same update, Rockstar added an option to enable subtitles upon first booting the game. The update also includes general bug fixes and improvements, although Rockstar didn't list which. 
If you bought Red Dead Redemption on PS4 recently to play on PS5, or were looking for a reason to do so, this new update that adds a 60 FPS option might be the reason you were looking for. Now, Rockstar please bring 60 FPS to Red Dead Redemption II on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. And bring 60 FPS in Red Dead Redemption to Xbox Series X/S, too. 
For more about the game, read Game Informer's Red Dead Redemption review and then read our column on remembering the mundane greatness of John Marston. After that, read Game Informer's ranking of every single Rockstar game.

After completing the game, it's safe to say that's definitely the case, with Mirage falling somewhere between where this franchise began and the modern RPGs of late. It feels modern but ditches the RPG mechanics and nature of the open-world games and instead embraces series tradition: a singular city to explore, a focus on stealth and parkour, one-hit assassinations, and more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Brian Jacques' Redwall books were my greatest obsession between the ages of approximately eight and 12-years-old. They're sort of The Lord of the Rings, but with talking woodlands animals, and their appeal for me consisted of three things 1) comedy British accents, 2) big fights, and 3) big feasts. I couldn't get enough, to the point that I tried to have one of my unborn siblings named after a badger warcry from the novel Salamandastron.
Fast-forward to 2023, and Oregon-based Soma Games are about to release a Redwall videogame, titled The Lost Legends of Redwall: The Scout Anthology. Will it measure up to my childhood fantasies about acorn pancakes slathered with gorseflower honey, or forest logboat armadas of squabbling guerilla shrews? Probably not, but what can? Here's a new trailer from publisher Forthright Entertainment.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Kumi Souls Games announced its gothic Soulslike metroidvania, The Last Faith, years ago, and last summer, we got a new trailer that indulged in the game's pixelated violence. We knew the game was coming late this year, but now it's official: The Last Faith hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on November 15. 
Kumi Souls Games announced this release date with a new gameplay trailer that you can watch below: 


If you don't want to wait until November 15 to jump into The Last Faith, you can check it out early with a new extended demo that's available right now on Steam. Kumi Souls Games says that in it, you can get a taste of Mythringal's brutal environment. 
"Often brutal, but always empowering, The Last Faith thrives on merciless and precise combat, with a huge range of custom executions to perform," a press release reads. "Players will unearth a formidable variety of melee weapons, arcane spells, and long-range firearms, allowing them to carve a path in their own style.
"Explore rich, gothic environments in order to piece together the fractured history of Mythringal, and survive intense encounters against swathes of blood-thirsty enemies who will stop at nothing to put an end to Eryk."
The Last Faith hits PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on November 15. 
Are you going to check out The Last Faith next month? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

I'm not sure The Fabulous Fear Machine - devised by Fictiorama Studios in partnership with AMC and Shudder - is quite that horrifying, but it's certainly chewing on my nerve endings in an engrossing way. 


It's a top-down management sim, which might not sound very scary, but just look at those colours - irradiated and unwholesome shades of purple and yellow, spreading over chunky, HyperCard continents emblazoned with pulp comic fonts. The visuals wear away at you like the stink of hydrochloric acid. And then there's that red-eyed, turbaned figure, gazing at you in top left. This is the face of the Fabulous Fear Machine. Its offer: to enable your character's world-toppling ambitions. Its price: that your story will become part of its story. The game is out today, and I've got some thoughts ahead of a possible review.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What exactly is The Alters? It's a question I've been itching to get answers to ever since Frostpunk and This War Of Mine developers 11 bit Studios first announced their strange new game at notE3 last year. Until now, all we've had to go on is a cryptic CG announcement trailer that showed a gaggle of identical clone-looking men in bright pink medical gowns, all of whom seemingly live inside a giant wheel full of shipping containers. It didn't really tell us anything about what the game actually is, or how it plays, and we've heard precious little about it since. 
Happily, I've now seen about an hour of The Alters in action at this year's Gamescom, and first impressions are very promising. This is indeed a game about sort-of clones living in a big wheely shipping container, but these containers are actually modules you'll be building in XCOM/Fallout Shelter-style chunks to advance the capabilities of your big wheel base as you work to escape the broiling heatdeath that's slowly enveloping the planet. You'll also be venturing out onto the planet's surface to gather resources, all while managing your crew of clo- sorry, alternate selves - as you assign their daily work tasks, and then there's the fact that, well, you're all chuffing different versions of the same person and the literal embodiment of what your life might have been like if you'd done X instead of Y, or Y instead of Z. It's a fascinating blend of ideas, and if 11 bit can stick the landing, I reckon it could end up being something really quite special. Here's everything I learned.

        <updated>2023-10-04T14:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[11 Bit Studios, the developer behind This War of Mine, Frostpunk, and Children of Morta, unveiled The Alters last year. It called it a sci-fi adventure where one man is trying to survive, and hopefully get home, after a space mission goes wrong. To do so, he must rely on both himself and various copies of himself. 
Today, 11 Bit Studios released a new trailer of The Alters that gives us our first look at its gameplay, which highlights that it's a third-person, base-building survival game. The team says the story is "driven by life-defining choices and exploring the diverse paths one could take" after Jan crash-lands on an inhospitable planet turning toward a massive sun. 
Check it out for yourself in The Alters gameplay trailer below: 


"In this desperate race against time, Jan must harness local Rapidium crystals to create his many versions: the 'Alters'," a press release reads. "Set within an ever-moving mobile base, both teamwork and building a wide range of expertise are indispensable for survival. By selecting diverging paths for other Jans during the alteration process, they acquire distinct skill sets. They become invaluable, not only for maintaining the base, but also for tasks like cooking, crafting tools for surface exploration, and gathering essential resources." 
11 Bit Studios says the Alters are more than mere resources, though, as they are sentient beings with their own emotions, problems, goals, and sometimes, existential doubts about their purpose. 
"Despite their differences, their collective goal is to escape, echoing Jan's determination to survive: I'll just do it all by myselves," the press release reads.

The Alters is due out on current-gen consoles and PC sometime in 2024. 
For more, watch The Alters' reveal trailer here, and then read Game Informer's reviews of 11 Bit Studios' other games: This War of Mine, Frostpunk, and Children of Morta.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After 11 years, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive has been, somewhat unceremoniously, shut down in favour of the newer, shinier Counter-Strike: 2. Whether you like it or not, Valve wants you playing CS2. For those who don't take their CS all too seriously, CS2 won't seem like much of a change from CS:GO, besides some grenade changes, more detailed maps, and a disappointing lack of fan favourite game modes. And for those who train their aim on the reg and line up their smoke grenades, CS2 might look the part but lacks the precision of CS:GO's movement and gunplay.
Still, CS2 captures what makes Counter-Strike tick and even if the foundation seems a little sparse and a touch shaky right now, I'm confident Valve have an FPS that'll supersede CS:GO in time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this year, Nintendo ended eShop functionality for the Nintendo 3DS and Wii U, marking the beginning of the end for these devices. Now, Nintendo has announced that online play and other device functionality that requires online communication is coming to an end, too. 
More specifically, Nintendo says online services for these devices will end in April 2024. 
As of early April 2024, online play and other functionality that uses online communication will end service for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U software. Thank you very much for your continued support of our products.
https://t.co/nOyzBImHCE
October 4, 2023
"In early April 2024, online play and other functionality that uses online communication will end for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U software," Nintendo's announcement reads. "This also includes cooperative play, internet rankings, and data distribution."
Nintendo says it will announce a specific end date and time at a later date and that it reserves the right to discontinue these online services earlier if "an event occurs that would make it difficult to continue online services" for the 3DS and Wii U. It also notes this includes software exclusive to the New Nintendo 3DS. 
The company then answers a number of questions in an FAQ section of the announcement. It notes that Pokemon Bank will still be usable following April 2024 and that "for the foreseeable future, it will still be possible to download update data and redownload purchased software and downloadable content from Nintendo eShop." 
The fan-favorite 3DS feature, StreetPass, will fortunately still work as it uses local communication between devices, but SpotPass, which uses online communication instead, will no longer be available after April 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm close to being whatever the Assassin's Creed equivalent of a Pokémon genwunner is. It's not like I'm snobby about the newer, more action-oriented Creeds; I welcomed the shift brought in by Assassin's Creed Origins, which shook the series up a bit, and I loved Cassandra kicking her way around Ancient Greece. Valhalla, although it had a relative dearth of things to parkour around, was a fun open-world RPG. Which I suppose is the point.
Assassin's Creed hasn't been a game about a group of assassins following a creed and striking from the shadows for a long time. Here I would say that Basim, protagonist of Assassin's Creed Mirage kicks down the door and kills everyone in the room, except this new entry in the series is smaller, more focused, and once again concerned largely with stealth, and is all the better for it. So it's more appropriate to say Basim snuck in through an open window and is choking everyone out one by one.

For players who first tried the series through those entries, Assassin’s Creed Mirage may be a shock. Set mainly within the single city of ninth-century Baghdad and playable to completion in under 20 hours, Mirage harkens back to the earliest entries starring Altaïr and Ezio.

It can be rare for a newer franchise to challenge a well-established genre leader for the throne, but that’s precisely what the Forza Motorsport series has done since its first entry in 2005. Since then, the sim-racing genre has featured dueling front-runners, with Gran Turismo and Forza Motorsport taking turns in the lead. The latest entry, simply titled Forza Motorsport, takes a back-to-basics approach to keep pace with its chief rival.

To 'free' itself from Google and Apple, in 2022 Russia launched its very own app store, which ironically offers dozens of VPNs. After the government recently announced the mandatory pre-installation of RuStore on tech gadgets, a draft law will outlaw censorship-circumventing VPNs on RuStore.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I was a computer science student, I developed a messaging app called HYPE with a few of my (more-talented) peers. It worked really well, and we even used it to talk during lectures, but of course we never released it out into the world and after leaving uni it was abandoned. Years later, I saw the brand called HYTE and my immediate reaction was "They stole our idea!"
Of course, my reading comprehension is poor, and HYTE - the iBuyPower PC case company - is unrelated to my unreleased, unannounced Linux-based chat app. 
And so it falls to me to tell you that if you don't have a knee-jerk reaction to four-letter words that look like acronyms but aren't, and you like small PC cases, you might be interested in this US deal for the HYTE Revolt 3. 
This critically-acclaimed Mini ITX PC case is down to $112 at Newegg or Ebay, a cut below its regular price of $200 and MSRP of $250. $112 is a bloody brilliant price for this case, especially as it comes with a pre-fitted 700W 80+ Gold SFX power supply.

But now Intel Linux graphics driver engineers have managed to pull off a solution for getting the sparse resources supported while using the existing i915 kernel DRM driver...]]></summary>

When I played Super Mario Bros. Wonder in August, I came away extremely impressed by the creativity at play with the series' return to the 2D side of the coin. I enjoyed my time so much that I was upset when I had to relinquish the controller at the end of my demo session. Thankfully, as part of our cover story for our latest issue, I was able to get a lot more time with Super Mario Bros. Wonder. While a lot of that time was spent further exploring the levels I had already played, I was also the first to experience three courses that appeared as part of the Super Mario Bros. Wonder-focused Nintendo Direct in late August.

Activision have put up a trailer for nu-Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3's multiplayer, ahead of a full live reveal at the Call of Duty: Next event on 5th October. I caught the news on a social feed somewhere, went hunting for the Youtube version and, much to my distress, managed to dig up the multiplayer premiere for the original Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, released in 2011 - almost 12 years ago. 


Rather than just posting the correct video and going off to cry about my advancing seniority, I'm brazenly posting both so you can trace the evolution (or not) of this shootiest of first-person shooter franchises. It's bizarre to think of any game series being this venerable, and changing so much while remaining the same.

I reviewed it myself as a freelancer and can't disagree with his verdict. Game ain't great. But I find myself itching to download and revisit this muddled open world contender all the same.

My fondest memories lie with Oblivion, because I think it captured exploration beautifully. I liked emerging from a big cave as a big nobody and striking out along a cobbled path, excited to go for a summer's walk. Skyrim abandoned Oblivion's warmth for your average fantasyland, but kept the great outdoors.
If I don't have an objective in Starfield, I sort of freeze over and don't really know where to turn. And even if I do, I perform a deep sigh and open up my menus and curl myself into a pinball, ready to get pinged around the innards of whatever can lies beyond the airlock in front of me. So far, Starfield's adventuring forces me indoors and it's a shame.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this year, developer Rocksteady Studios and Warner Bros. Games revealed that it was bringing its Batman: Arkham trilogy to the Switch this fall. This collection does not include Batman: Arkham Origins (a great game), which was developed by Gotham Knights studio Warner Bros. Games Montreal. The Batman: Arkham Trilogy, as the Switch collection is called, was due out this month on October 13 but has now been delayed to December. 
More specifically, Batman: Arkham Trilogy hits Swtich on December 1. As for why, the team says more time is needed on its development. 
"More time is needed to bring players the best possible experience on Nintendo Switch," Rocksteady's statement on Twitter reads. "We apologize to fans who are excited to play this version of the trilogy. Thank you for your patience."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Kotaku is reporting that Naughty Dog, the PlayStation first-party studio behind The Last of Us and Uncharted franchises, has laid off at least 25 developers, cutting their contracts short. The layoffs reportedly began last week, according to two of Kotaku's sources and various departments, from art to production, were hit. The majority of those laid off were in Naughty Dog's quality assurance testing department. 
The 25 contract developers laid off were part of a downsizing at the studio, but Kotaku reports that full-time staff do not appear to be affected. The publication's sources say severance is not being offered to those laid off and those affected (as well as those still working at Naughty Dog) are "being pressured to keep the news quiet."

        <updated>2023-10-03T12:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Forest Cathedral is an environmental thriller that hit Xbox Series X/S and PC earlier this year in March. Now, Game Informer can exclusively reveal it hits PlayStation 5 on October 31, making this a great spooky experience for the holiday. 
For the uninitiated, The Forest Cathedral is inspired by events surrounding real-life scientist Rachel Carson's investigation into Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, otherwise known as the harmful DDT pesticide. Publisher Whitethorn Games says this game is "a dramatic reimagining of Carson's environmental science book, Silent Spring." 
You can get a look at it in The Forest Cathedral PS5 release date trailer below: 


As you can see in the trailer above, in The Forest Cathedral, players take on the role of Rachel in her new field research biologist position on a mysterious island. What begins as simply completing weekly work tasks becomes something more horrific when Rachel learns about what DDT is doing to the area. Whitethorn says players "will slowly uncover the horrific effects of the pesticide using advanced environment technology to complete puzzles that weave together 3D exploration with 2D platforming." 

As far as gameplay goes, players switch between Rachel Carson in a 3D world and the "Little Man" inside the 2D world of Rachel's scanning tools. It's in this 2D world where players will solve puzzles and complete platforming challenges.
The Forest Cathedral is available right now on Xbox Series X/S and PC via Steam. It hits PS5 on Halloween.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Marvel's Spider-Man is almost here. Set to hit PlayStation 5 exclusively on October 20, PlayStation and developer Insomniac Games have continued to ramp up excitement surrounding the sequel with trailers, gameplay, and more. And last night, PlayStation released a new extended 60-second TV spot that gives us a more cinematic look at these heroes' latest adventure. 
The trailer is CGI and it's gorgeous. We see Peter Parker and Miles Morales come to grips with the challenges before them, both in the suit and out of it; all to the backdrop of a massive fight in broad daylight against Venom. If this trailer is any indication, Venom is quite the formidable foe for these two. 
Check it out for yourself in the Marvel's Spider-Man 2 trailer below: 


As you can see, Marvel's Spider-Man 2 continues to look great, and fortunately, we don't have to wait long to get our hands on it because it hits PS5 on October 20. 
In the meantime, read about how Marvel's Spider-Man 2 features more than 65 suits and then read our thoughts on the game after going hands-on with it. Check out Game Informer's Marvel's Spider-Man 2 New Gameplay Today after that.

The new patch reverts companion behaviour to their pre-Patch 3 behaviour, for a less frustrating RPG experience. In even more momentous tidings, it re-shaves that cat everybody loves.

Designed by Volker Wertich, one of the original creators of The Settlers, the new village 'em up puts you in charge of medieval tribes scattered around an almost eerily scenic island chain. 


It's all about the little touches: check out those azure windmill blades, flickering in the breeze! And how about the little animations of people hefting barrels of water? Man, it makes me want to jump in there and start stamping on everything, wailing and babbling like a mad god. But let's not do that. Let's play the demo instead. It gives you three maps, and lands ahead of the game's early access launch on 13th December.

There are also fixes for a shader compilation bug that may, nonetheless, still exist for AMD GPUs when playing this latest iteration of the developer's free-to-play team and objective-based shooter. Many of the larger issues returning players have, such as the absence of Mac support, are yet to be addressed.

B is for Back-stabbing, referring to the stealthy player who may stack objects so as to clamber into vents, and whack guards deftly in the noggin to escape detection.
And C is for Conversing, referring to the act of wooing civilians - who thus far seem miraculously unbothered by your menacing hooded appearance and sepulchral accent - so as to procure door codes and the location of keycards. You can see all these approaches in the game's new trailer, below.

Never one to say no to a bout of space strategy, I fired up a preview key over the weekend, and while I wouldn't say my pulse has jumped to hyperspace, I'm certainly enthused.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last week ended with a dire flood of layoffs in the games industry, including Sega, Ubisoft, Blizzard, and Epic games. Unfortunately, this week seems to be following the trend – Team17, developer of the Worms series, and publisher of games like Blasphemous, Dredge, and more, has announced layoffs as well, according to Eurogamer.
The job losses, which are due to a "company restructure," will eliminate about 50 positions from the company, and the majority of those positions will be in the publisher's QA department. Eurogamer also reports the news was delivered to employees during an emergency town hall meeting this morning.
In addition to members of the QA team, Team17 CEO Michael Pattison will also be stepping down, according to a statement received by VG247. This stands in sharp contrast to many other recent layoffs, where executives had been exempt from cost-cutting measures. You can read the full statement below.
For more on the recent wave of layoffs, read about how Sega canceled several upcoming games and how Epic laid off over 800 people.

And yet, as expected, it’s set to be stuffed senseless with computer kit; there are already dozens of offers on SSDs, gaming mice and keyboards, and laptops ahead of the main event on October 10th-11th. Also: loads more. This guide to the best early Prime Big Deal Days PC gaming deals (urgh, see?) will pick out the highlights for your consuming convenience.
The majorest of major disclaimers: these early deals aren’t yet subject to the defining rule of Prime Big Deal Days, specifically that its juciest savings will only be for Prime members. In other words, any deals on this list, right now, are available to everyone.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the frozen hellscape of Frostpunk, you eked out your existence in hours and days, clinging to your heat- and life-giving generator at the centre of your fledgling city like there was literally no tomorrow. In 11 bit Studio's forthcoming sequel, Frostpunk 2, the apocalypse is yesterday's news. Now you're dealing with "what happens when you survive the un-survivable," as the game's co-director and design director Jakub Stokalski neatly puts it when I sit down for a hands off presentation at this year's Gamescom. And to do this, Frostpunk 2 is going big, measuring its time not in days, but weeks, months and even years.
"If we want to show the evolution of societies and different utopias/dystopias, we need breathing room," says Stokalski. "And this breathing room really is in the scale, both in the physical sense but also in the sense of time. It's difficult to show meaningful social change in the space of a month, so the time ticks now in weeks and months, and in a long playthrough you'll get up into years, so you can see the consequences of your choices."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bilkins' Folly is a throwback pirate adventure game that's out today on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC. It's a game that's been on my radar since earlier this year: both because I love most anything related to pirates and because, well, Bilkins' Folly looks great. Between its visuals, throwback gameplay, nautical tunes, and modern reimaginings of old-school adventure gameplay, it caught my attention. And now it's finally out!
I spoke to developer Webbysoft, who is mostly just one person based in Australia, about Bilkins' Folly ahead of the game's release over email. We discussed the game's inspiration, the challenges of the adventure genre, the game's gibberish language, how the idea of it came from a missing wedding ring, and much more.

Now, just under two weeks after the game's launch, developer Starbeeze Studios says the matchmaking issues are fixed. 
The team has also revealed the game's first update will launch this month. Plus, Starbreeze says more than 3.1 million unique players played the game last month, with the peak concurrent player count hitting 124,254.

Ouch. Still, Steam user verdicts are markedly more enthusiastic, and what kind of jaded soul would turn his nose up at a Cluster Shot launcher with bouncing bullets? Bouncing bullets, Matt.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["Boomer shooter" is a recent video game genre term used to describe contemporary games that exist as throwbacks to the Doom-inspired era of first-person shooters where speed and firepower are everything. Phantom Fury is not the first game to explore this playground, and it likely won't be the last, but playing the demo left a good first impression. The visuals are cool, the shooting feels good, and protagonist Shelly “Bombshell” Harrison is not afraid to throw out a good one-liner when the mood strikes her.
Phantom Fury is coming to PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC sometime this year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With Mortal Kombat 1 on the horizon, we're revisiting the entry that set the series on its current trajectory: 2011's Mortal Kombat (aka MK 9). Join us today on Twitch at 2:00 p.m. Central as we take a bloody journey through the game's genre-defining story campaign. Episodes will be uploaded to our Game Informer Shows YouTube channel the following Saturday morning. 
After 2006's Mortal Kombat: Armageddon seemingly concluded the franchise's main narrative, 2011's entry picked up the bloody pieces. It moved the saga forward by resetting the timeline, serving as a soft reboot that brought Mortal Kombat back to its 2D fighting roots and ushering in the return of the classic roster. MK 9's cinematic story mode served as an epiphany for the series and fighting games as a whole, establishing the blueprint for narrative fighting campaigns still utilized today. MK9's story also serves as the first chapter of the modern trilogy of games that Mortal Kombat 1 builds upon. For a whole lot more on MK9 and its development, you can read this feature on how the reboot saved the franchise.
Join editors Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard as they battle their way through MK 9 to see how its reimagined tournament holds up.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[12 years later, The Binding of Isaac remains my go-to roguelite. There have been some incredible Rogue-inspired games since, but nothing has quite stuck its disgusting, fly and poop-covered hooks in me like Edmund McMillen’s tale of a crying child fighting his murderous mother using the power of his tears. Yes, I’m in therapy, why do you ask?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In another reality, 2003's The Simpsons: Hit & Run — an action-adventure game that was by then the show's 22nd video game adaptation — might have slid quietly into obscurity. So why is it, then, that we can't seem to let it go? On YouTube, the game frequently resurfaces via longplays, speedruns, and retrospective essays that garner respectable amounts of views year after year. A few months ago, the game's lead designer told GamesRadar that he would support an official remake, mentioning that Hit & Run continues to be The Simpsons' most popular video game adaptation on Metacritic.
Yet Hit & Run's sustained relevance is, on its surface, a bit of an enigma. You'd be hard-pressed to find the game included in any critical canons or best-of lists, and there's hardly been a shortage of T-rated open-world games since its release. But for many, the game isn't just a source of nostalgia today; it was an introduction to a wholly new form of in-game self-expression. I looked into the still-growing community keeping it alive today.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[FSR 3, AMD’s framerate-roiding answer to DLSS 3 frame generation, is ready to roll in its first supporting games. Great! Except these are currently limited to tedious magic shooters Forspoken and Immortals of Aveum, which is less great. 
Regardless, this could be a major moment for basically any modern graphics card that isn’t an Nvidia RTX 40 series model. FSR 3’s Fluid Motion Frames system works in a broadly similar manner to DLSS 3, piecing together whole new frames outside of the usual GPU rendering pipeline and slipping them onto your screen between the 'real' frames. The result (in theory – I’ll be trying FSR 3 out in depth next week) is higher FPS with no extra strain on your PC, and unlike Nvidia’s frame generation, it doesn’t need any specialist hardware to work.  Therefore older cards, as well as recent AMD GPUs like the RX 7700 XT and RX 7800 XT, could get a new lease of life in games that support it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During the Nintendo Direct the other week, a single game stood head and shoulders above the rest for me. It wasn't Super Mario Wonder (though that does look pretty all right for a 2D Mario game), and it wasn't F-Zero 99 (which I sort of instantly dismissed as a cheap cash-in on that most excellent of neglected Nintendo racing games but have since been told is also quite good). Rather, it was the news that the insta-sit-up-and-pay-attention pairing of Atlus and Vanillaware were making a new fantasy tactics RPG called - wait for it - Unicorn Overlord, and woah nelly, it looks absolutely incredible. Vanillaware games have always been a feast for the eyes - see Muramasa: The Demon Blade on Wii and more recently 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim on PS4 and Switch - and the thought of marrying those lovely visuals with what appears to be a pixel art mash-up of Final Fantasy Tactics and Fire Emblem? Yes please and thank you. 
I was all ready to gush about it in a news post and whack it straight into our release date calendar when I first saw it. But then my heart sank. The press release for it came through, and despite it launching on literally every other console including the Nintendo Switch, PC was not among them. My heart. It was broken.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Oh god, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm trying to fix it. Oh, hello everybody! Welcome to the fourth chapter of the great Starfield no-planets run, in which my character, rancid astro-buccaneer Mary Read, tries to play the entirety of Bethesda's so-big-it's-small RPG in space. When last we caught up with this galloping galactic nuisance, Mary was beginning to lose momentum. She had grown weary of happy-slapping freighter after freighter, though there's one particular wandering geologist she'd like to settle the score with. She had even lost her enthusiasm for boarding actions - the spice in every pirate's cup of grog - having mastered the art of standing at the bottom of a ladder. 


I've spent the past few days trying to cook up a proper endgame objective for Mary - some mad caper befitting a legendary space pirate and her rowdy crew of turncoats and tearaways, who absolutely aren't a bunch of corpses Mary has arranged into sitting postures and decorated with buckets. And in my desperation, I have turned to the forbidden magic of Starfield console commands - a hundred or more deceptively homely lines of text which, when typed into Starfield's in-game console (hit the tilde or @ key), can be used to perform impossible feats, like unlocking all the game's powers or becoming immortal. My initial hope was to solidify the game's weirdly intangible asteroids somehow, and build outposts on them. It's been a couple hours since then, and well, everything has gone awonk. I'm not even playing Starfield anymore. Instead, I am playing a very special, inadvertent Starfield mod of my own devising. Working title: "Totally Fucked".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Beijing-based audio brand Edifier makes some of the best value speakers in the business, often offering significantly better performance, functionality and aesthetics than more well-known Western brands. I've reviewed a half-dozen of their speakers over the years, and each one has been impressive. 
I'm currently recommending Edifier's R2000DB and S3000PRO speakers over at Eurogamer, but today an even more affordable model is on sale at Amazon US: the R1700BTs. These 2.0 bookshelf speakers normally go for $199, but today you can apply a $40 coupon on the product page to bring these speakers down to... $159, if my maths are correct. That's a solid deal for speakers that come with a litany of positive critic and user reviews.

Except, of course, that the vast majority of those reviews are for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, a game that is no longer playable. If you filter the reviews to just yesterday and today, you'll find that there have been 3450 of them, just 59% of which are positive, which would give Counter-Strike 2 a rating of "Mixed".

Epic had acquired SuperAwesome in 2020. 250 people will be leaving Epic as a result of these divestitures.

The abstract environmental puzzle game has become its own genre in recent years, with some telling stories that are strange but easy to parse and others being so opaque that the player can ascribe almost any meaning to what is transpiring on screen. On this difficult-to-define spectrum, Cocoon lands on the latter half of the scale. I basically never had any idea why I was doing what I was doing or what the larger goal was, but I didn’t mind for a moment because the puzzles scratch your brain so effectively that I was always eager to complete wh…]]></summary>

Gaming franchises need to evolve to stay relevant. Whether it's expanding on certain mechanics or overhauling quality-of-life features, any great series that's been around as long as Bomberman is forced to make changes or be left in the dust. Unfortunately for Super Bomberman R 2, the changes it makes to the formula are mostly unsuccessful. While games with your friends can be thrilling, online play is hit-or-miss, and its story mode is a huge letdown. I respect Konami for trying new things with Bomberman. …]]></summary>

When it hits PS5 on November 15, it will also join the PlayStation Plus Game Catalog for PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium members.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Colossal Order and publisher Paradox Interactive have delayed the console release of Cities: Skylines II. Originally set to release on October 24 alongside the PC version, the team has delayed the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X versions of the game to spring of next year. The PC version will still launch next month. 
As for why, Colossal Order says in an update made on Twitter that the team needs more time to reach quality targets it has set for the console release. 
"Mayors, we're hard at work getting the game ready for release," the update reads. "We've come to realize that we need more time to reach the quality targets set for console. We want to provide the best experience for our players, we're updating the release window for Xbox & PS5 to Spring 2024."

In a separate statement via email, Colossal Order and Paradox Interactive say, "The additional time allows us to focus on matching the quality and performance across all platforms." It also says it is updating the minimum and recommended PC specs as optimization work continues, and that it will share more updates on the console release window soon. 
Cities: Skylines II hits PC on October 24. The PS5 and Xbox Series X versions will be released sometime next spring. 
In the meantime, watch the Cities: Skylines II reveal trailer here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dark Side, the exciting sequel of the groundbreaking Driller, is ready for public testing!
Dark Side, like its predecessor, was released by Incentive Software Limited in 1988, shortly after Driller. The updated gameplay features a jetpack that allows you to leave the ground, providing a new and fresh perspective that emphasizes the excitement and challenges of exploring Tricuspid, the second alien moon of planet Evath.
This time, the vicious Ketars have scattered and hidden Energy Collection Devices (ECD) around their base to destroy your home planet. It’s up to you to destroy them first! The tricky part is many ECDs are connected to each other and can regenerate instantly, so you must figure out the right order to successfully complete your mission. 
Our reimplementation of the Freescape engine features graphics using software (TinyGL) or hardware mode (OpenGL) at arbitrary resolution. The initial Dark Side support includes DOS (EGA/CGA modes), ZX Spectrum and Amstrad CPC. Additionally, there are two playable demos if you want to test the game. Support for Amiga and AtariST will be available later! Please contact us if you have some other release.
To play any of these supported releases, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The day has come. We are super happy to announce public beta testing for the iOS port of ScummVM in the store. Yes, you read it right! Since Lars Sundström, aka lman, joined our team as the iOS porter, we have made significant progress. Thus, you no longer need to compile ScummVM yourself in order to add it to your iOS or iPadOS device. 
If you want to help by testing this version, just follow this Testflight link and enroll yourself in the test program. This may require installing Apple’s Testflight app. You can find instructions on how to install games and how to play them on our documentation portal.
We truly appreciate your feedback. You can share your thoughts with the Testflight feedback feature, where you can attach screenshots and post detailed descriptions. Alternatively, you can use our bugtracker, e-mail us at ios@scummvm.org, or post on our Discord Server. Your help will let us eventually add ScummVM to the App Store.
